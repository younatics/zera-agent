"A New Hampshire man has been accused of putting the two-year-old son of his girlfriend in a clothes dryer and turning it on, seriously burning the boy. According to a police affidavit, Adam Morton, 27, admitted to investigators that he lowered the child into the dryer in early August, leaving the child with second degree burns on his back, arms and feet. Morton was left in charge of the boy by his partner and claims that even though he did put the boy inside the dryer, he did so for only one revolution of the drum. Accused: According to police in Maine, Adam Morton (pictured) has admitted to putting a two-year-old boy (not in the above photo) in a dryer while babysitting for his girlfriend . However, according to WCSH6, the police affidavit contains the evidence of Dr. Lawrence Ricci, who conducted his own forensic examination of the boy. He concluded 'there were lesions on the lower back that looked like they could have been healing burns and incidentally, the two circular lesions correspond to bolts on the inside of the dryer. Ricci also said that 'the distribution of the burns indicates either that the child was moving fairly dramatically and or the dryer was moving.' In conclusion, Dr. Ricci said that the boy was inside the dryer for a 'fairly prolonged period of time. And the dryer, indeed, may have actaully been turning.' Cruelty: While it is not clear why he did so, Morton has allegedly admitted to police that he put the two-year-old in the dryer . As part of their ongoing investigation, police took the dryer from the mother's Maine home and tested to see how hot the drum got when it was on. They put the machine on for five minutes at the 'low' setting and the dryer hit 125 degrees. However, when it was put on 'normal' for three minues the temperatrue hit 180 degrees. Morton was staying with his girlfriend and her three other children when the incident occurred. According to WSCH6, when representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services arrived to interview the other children, the were told by them that Morton 'does mean things' to the boy. Morton is currently facing a charge of aggravated assault and is currently in custody on $2,500 cash bail.",Adam Morton is charged with aggravated assault and has admitted his guilt to police .
"Prince Harry is to be bumped down to fifth in line to the throne after news the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting a second baby. Harry dropped to fourth in the line of succession after Prince George was born in July last year, and now just days before he is due to celebrate his 30th birthday comes the news that he will fall another place in the Royal rankings. Regardless of whether the new baby is a girl or a boy, it will take Harry's fourth place spot, when it is born next year, making it extremely unlikely that the Prince will ever become king. Scroll down for video . Bumped: Prince Harry (left) will fall to fifth in line to the throne following the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's new baby . However, Harry - who turns 30 on September 15 - has plenty to keep him busy despite being leapfrogged by the new baby. As well as celebrating his milestone birthday, and inheriting £10million pounds left to him by his mother Diana, Princess of Wales Harry has his Army duties to occupy him, and has been heavily involved in the forthcoming Invictus Games for injured servicemen and women. He is also involved in a number of charities, including Sentebale, which was co-founded by the Prince, and works to support orphaned children in Africa. Slipping back: Regardless of whether the new baby is a girl or a boy, it will take Harry's fourth place spot, when it is born next year, making it extremely unlikely that the Prince will ever become king . Third place: Harry became fourth in line to the throne after the birth of Prince George last July . As a sibling to Prince George, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s second child will also not be expected to be crowned sovereign. But second-born royal children - often dubbed the 'spare to heir' - have on occasion ended up as monarch. The country’s last king, George VI, was not meant to accede to the throne and only did so when his older brother Edward VIII abdicated over his love for American divorcee Wallis Simpson in 1936. George VI’s father, George V, was also not destined to wear the crown. But he outlived his older brother the Duke of Clarence and Avondale - Prince Albert Victor - who died from flu in 1892. George V became king in 1910. Keeping busy: Harry has been heavily involved with the forthcoming Invictus Games . William and Kate’s new baby will be a great-grandchild to the Queen and a great-great-great-great-great-grandchild of Queen Victoria. When Prince George was born on July 22, last year, he automatically became third in line to the throne of Britain and 15 other Commonwealth nations, following his father the Duke of Cambridge, and grandfather, the Prince of Wales. He is likely to take the throne as King George VII around the end of the century - although previous monarchs have not been averse to changing their name, such as the Queen's father, who was known as Bertie, but who ruled as George VI because Queen Victoria declared she did not want another 'Albert'. The new baby will also push Prince Andrew down to sixth place, followed by his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie in seventh and eighth. Prince Edward goes into ninth, with his children Viscount Severn and Lady Louise Windsor in tenth and 11th. Even though Louise is older, the changes to the law of succession are not being applied retrospectively. The most recent royal baby, Mia Tindall - the daughter of Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall - will become 17th in line to the throne. She does not bear a royal title. The baby will be a prince or princess thanks to the Queen, who stepped in ahead of Prince George’s birth to ensure all William’s children would become HRHs with fitting titles. The Queen issued a Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm in December 2012 when Kate was just a few months’ pregnant, declaring “all the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales should have and enjoy the style, title and attribute of royal highness with the titular dignity of prince or princess prefixed to their Christian names or with such other titles of honour”. A Letters Patent in 1917, issued by George V, limited titles within the royal family, meaning a daughter born to William or Kate would not have been an HRH but Lady (forename) Mountbatten-Windsor instead and a second-born son would also have lacked the HRH title and become Lord (forename) Mountbatten-Windsor rather than a prince. William’s cousin Princess Eugenie, who was born in 1990, was the last royal baby to be given the title Princess. The Earl and Countess of Wessex’s daughter Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor is also technically a princess, but her parents decided, with the Queen’s agreement, that she would use the courtesy title of the daughter of an Earl instead. If the baby is a girl, it will be the first time a great granddaughter of a still-serving sovereign has been born in direct succession on the male line since 1897, when George VI’s sister Princess Mary was born.","New baby will take Harry's fourth place spot, even if it is a girl .

"Tom Gray thought he had hit the jackpot when he found two matching numbers on his National Lottery scratchcard. When he saw the pair of dice, each with four dots, the 75-year-old  cancer patient couldn’t wait to start planning how he would spend his £80,000 winnings – on his children and grandchildren. But when his daughter Alison Gray tried to help him claim his prize,  Lottery officials told her he had only won £2. Not a winner: Tom Gray from Romford in Essex with the scratchcard that officials say shows he only won £2 . It appears that a printing error had deleted part of the scratchcard and that one of the dice was  supposed to have five dots. Mr Gray, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in October, had hoped to share the money with his four children and eight grandchildren. The former gas and central heating fitter, from Harold Hill in Essex, said: ‘[The card] said if you match the dots on the dice you’ve won, and the dice showed four dots on each. ‘It’s their fault if there’s a printing error. I hope they realise it’s their mistake.’ Miss Gray, 51, added: ‘I was gutted for my dad because he had already started thinking about what he was going to do for his kids. That’s what he’s mostly upset about. He’s really down about it. ‘It seems so unfair. Even if it is a misprint, whose fault is that?’ Miss Gray, an accountant for Ford Credit, has been caring for her father since he fell ill. She bought two scratchcards, for him and for herself, from a Tesco near Romford, Essex, last month. The scratchcard Mr Gray used has a line through it on which no black ink has printed. It runs through one of the dice, covering the area where a fifth dot would have appeared. Miss Gray said: ‘My dad scratched off his and got to the second dice then passed it over to me and said, “I can’t believe it”.’ Printing error: The scratchcard showing the winning line of dice . The £2 Lucky Streak card offers a prize if the player has two identical dice – which Mr Gray says he did. In Mr Gray’s case, the prizes offered were £10, £50, £5,000 and £80,000, with the top prize listed alongside the two dice that appeared to have four spots. Camelot say he is entitled to £2. It appears that he won this from another game on the same card.Miss Gray said: ‘He started  listing what he’d spend the cash on, like paying his car off, and he asked me how much was left on my mortgage.’ But when she rang to claim the money, she was told the card was not listed as a jackpot winner in the central database. ""He started listing what he’d spend the cash on, like paying his car off, and he asked me how much was left on my mortgage."" - Daughter Alison Gray . She added: ‘I called up the number on the back and gave them the serial numbers but the woman said “you’ve won £2”.’ A spokesman for Camelot, the operator of the National Lottery, said this is the first time a query has been raised about a win on their Lucky Streak scratchcard. The spokesman said: ‘In order to look into this further, we would need the player to post the scratchcard to us. This is so we can determine what might have happened to this particular card.’She added: ‘It is worth noting that the outcome of each National Lottery scratchcard game is predetermined at the time of print and all our operations and processes are subject to the scrutiny of our own internal auditors, independent external auditors and representatives from our regulator, the Gambling Commission.’ Lucky Streak scratchcards come printed with two games, offering eight opportunities to win differing cash prizes. They have been on the market since the beginning of September. To date, £15.2million has been paid out in prizes, including five top prizes of £80,000. The company says there is a one in four chance of winning a prize on each card.","Cancer patient from Romford bought the scratchcard from Tesco .

"The Queen's current surgeon-gynaecologist Alan Farthing is expected to lead the royal birth team . The elite medical team that oversaw the Duchess of Cambridge's first pregnancy will once again be by her side. The Queen's current surgeon-gynaecologist Alan Farthing is expected to lead the team, accompanied by obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston, a specialist in high-risk pregnancies. Unlike last time, however, there will be no Marcus Setchell, who led the delivery of Prince George. Sir Marcus, royal surgeon-gynaecologist for 18 years, delayed his retirement until the royal birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital on July 22, 2013. He went on to be made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Orders (KCVO) – an honour given as the personal gift of the Queen. Consultant Mr Farthing, 51, is the former fiancé of murdered television presenter Jill Dando. When he took on his role for the royal household in 2008, he became one of the youngest doctors to treat the royal family. After qualifying as a doctor in 1986 from St George's Hospital Medical School, London, he became a member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1991, and a fellow in 2003. In 1997, he became a consultant gynaecologist at St Mary’s Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Imperial College, London. He is a specialist in gynaecological cancer care and an internationally recognised expert in keyhole surgery. He later went on to open his own private Harley Street practice and works as a consultant at two teaching hospitals in London, Queen Charlotte’s in Shepherd’s Bush and St Mary’s in Paddington – where father-to-be the Duke of Cambridge was born in 1982. Mr Farthing was engaged to Crimewatch presenter Miss Dando, 37, when she was murdered in 1999, five months before they were due to marry. The couple met at a dinner party in 1997 and announced their engagement in 1999. Miss Dando was shot dead on her doorstep in April that year. In 2008, he married Dr Janet Stowell, whom he met in 2003 when she was a young house doctor at St Mary’s, Paddington. They live in St John’s Wood, London in a detached £3 million house, and have a four-year-old son. Obstetrician Mr Thorpe-Beeston works at London’s private Portland Hospital and on Harley Street having amassed 18 years’ experience as a consultant. The doctor, who says he like to ‘keep things simple’ by ‘offering honest advice’, specialises in pre-natal diagnosis, deliveries and ultrasound. Mr Farthing was engaged to TV presenter Jill Dando (pictured) when she was murdered in 1999, five months before they were due to marry.  When he took on his role for the royal household in 2008, he became one of the youngest doctors to treat the royal family. The couple are pictured with the Queen in 1998 . Royal surgeon-gynaecologist Mr Farthing (right) will be accompanied by obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston (left), a specialist in high-risk pregnancies. Sir Marcus Setchell, who led the birth team last time, retired after the birth of Prince George last year (the trio are pictured shortly afterwards outside St Mary's Hospital) He graduated from Cambridge University in 1984 worked at King’s College Hospital, London, becoming a consultant in foetal medicine in 1996 at Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust. Prince William and his brother Harry were delivered by Sir Marcus' predecessor, the late Sir George Pinker, who delivered nine royal babies between 1973 and 1990. Sir Marcus delivered both of the Countess of Wessex’s children, Lady Louise, nine, and James, Viscount Severn, four. The countess collapsed and was close to death when Lady Louise was born prematurely in 2003, after the placenta ruptured the lining of the womb. Mr Setchell also led the medical care following Sophie’s ectopic pregnancy in 2001 and performed the Duchess of Cornwall’s hysterectomy in 2007. Sir Marcus Setchell, surgeon and royal gynecologist, delayed his retirement to see Kate through her pregnancy and birth. Speaking in July on BBC4’s Woman’s Hour, a year after the birth, the now retired 70-year-old described Kate and William as ‘just another healthy young couple giving birth to a hopefully very healthy baby'. However, a year on, the memories of the intense media scrutiny that surrounded the birth were obviously still fresh with the veteran doctor. He said: ‘The pressures of the hundreds of media people outside the hospital didn't affect me, at least not more than minimally.’ Sir Marcus praised the midwifery team who assisted Kate during labour, describing them as ‘perfectly wonderful’ but hinted that his expertise was needed during the 14-hour labour. He rather vaguely said: ‘There are certain situations when someone is giving birth that it's important not just to have a specialist sort of available at the end of a telephone, but actually in the same room to deal with anything that's immediately going to be wrong.’ Retired royal surgeon-gynaecologist Sir Marcus Setchell described Kate and William as ‘just another healthy young couple giving birth to a hopefully very healthy baby'","Royal surgeon-gynaecologist Alan Farthing, 51, will supervise the pregnancy .

"Their furry coats and cute name make it tempting to reach out a hand and give them a pet, but the puss caterpillar is no pussycat. Scientists in Florida are warning anyone who sees a puss caterpillar to look but under no circumstances to touch. Beneath the fluffy exterior of the plump, fuzzy little creatures are venomous bristles that cause excruciating pain if touched. No pussycat: The puss caterpillar is completely covered in greyish-brown fur that conceals poisonous spines . Prevalent: The fluffy bugs are in abundance in Florida right now and live in elm, sycamore and oak trees . The cute bugs are the most poisonous in Florida, and the toxin in their spines cause worse pain than stings from wasps, jellyfish and scorpians. They're particularly prevalent at certain times of the year - and one of those times is now. Typically, the caterpillar can be seen in early autumn and spring. They live in elms, oaks and sycamore trees and are apt to fall out of trees. At its largest, the puss caterpillar grows to one inch long and eventually matures into the harmless feathered southern flannel moth. If touched, its poisonous bristles break off into the skin causing intense pain and sometimes fever, vomiting and a drop in blood pressure. Adult: The poisonous youngster matures into the harmless - but still fluffy - feathered southern flannel moth . Dr. Jeffrey Bernstein, the director of the Florida Poison Information Center in Miami told the Sun Sentinel that he has seen patients pass out from the pain. 'We don't see any deaths from it, but it is very painful, judging by the number of people that just are out-of-control hysterical when they call,' he said. The Poison Center in Tampa recommends placing Scotch tape over the affected area and pulling it off repeatedly to remove the stinging spines from the skin. Next, apply an ice-pack and then follow a paste of baking soda and water. In rare cases, patients may need to see a doctor, particularly if they have a history of hay fever, asthma or allergy.","Puss caterpillars are prevalent this time of year in Florida .

"It may seem all glitz and glamour. But this year's Miss America pageant, held in New Jersey, is marred by family tragedies including homicide, suicide and drug abuse. Miss Wisconsin is struggling to overcome her 18-year-old brother's suicide - and the revelation that he was addicted to methamphetamine. Revealed: This year's Miss Wisconsin, Raenna Johnson, is still grieving the suicide of her 18-year-old brother and a toxicology report into his death has recently revealed he was addicted to methamphetamine . Tragic: Kansas's Amanda Sasek (left) is coming to terms with her father's suicide. Miss Delaware, or Brittany Lewis (right) is fighting for justice four years after her sister was shot dead following an abusive relationship . Delaware's representative is fighting for the arrest of her sister's killer. And Miss Kansas is still traumatised by her father's suicide six years ago, which drove her to anorexia. She is now recovered and building her life back together. The traumatic details emerged as the girls picked the causes they plan to support for the 'public service' section of the contest. Each contestant will speak at a variety of events to promote their cause and educate others about it. Since 1989, aspiring Miss Americas have toured the country addressing causes including homelessness, HIV/AIDS prevention, domestic violence, diabetes awareness, character education, and literacy. Wisconsin's Raenna Johnson, 24, announced she will be supporting young people battling drug abuse - in tribute to her brother. 'Since his death, I've learned the science of and the effects of meth on the human body,' said Johnson, who hopes for a career in nonprofit development. Causes: Details of the tragedies emerged as the girls picked causes to support for the public service segment . Contest: The girls, including Raenna Johnson (second left) will tour the country giving talks on their topic . 'I am adamant about wanting to prevent tragedies like this from happening to other families.' Miss Delaware Brittany Lewis, 23, will address domestic violence prevention. Her sister, Gina Nicole Clarke-Lewis, was shot to death in her New Jersey apartment in 2010 in a case that remains unsolved. She had been in an abusive relationship for five years before her death. 'It took me a long time to come to terms with it,' said Lewis, who grew up in Brigantine, New Jersey, next door to Atlantic City, and hopes one day to host a political television show. 'Being part of the Miss America Organization has given me a voice on being strong and has allowed me to cope and let her memory live on.' She has visited college campuses to talk to young women about healthy dating relationships and how to recognize the warning signs of potentially abusive situations. She has also contacted legislators to urge them to keep domestic violence awareness a priority, and she wants to establish shelters for battered women that have a range of social services all under one roof. Amanda Sasek's platform as Miss Kansas is to help people find their strengths, in memory of her father. Platforms: The 53 contestants (pictured during their arrival ceremony last Wednesday) will talk about their chosen platforms during the nationally televised pageant finale on Sunday night . 'After he committed suicide, I thought the way to handle that was to be so strong that I didn't feel anything anymore, didn't have any emotions,' said Sasek, 23, who hopes to become a university professor of political science and public policy. She eventually developed anorexia and had to struggle to overcome it. She wants to help others who have lost loved ones through suicide. 'While I don't have my father anymore, I do have the opportunity to change a lot of lives in the process and have a new beginning,' she said. The contestants will talk about their platforms during the nationally televised pageant finale on Sunday night. 'All 53 contestants every year have something that motivates them toward their area of community service,' said Sam Haskell, CEO of the Miss America Organization. 'The catalyst is usually something personal. I find it incredibly empowering for the contestants to talk about their issues. Through their own tragedies, they want to help others.'","Contestants revealed tragedies that inspired their public service causes .

"Dabbled: Sir Roger Moore admitted he tried Viagra once but that it did not work . As James Bond he rarely encountered problems satisfying his conquests in bed. But off-screen it appears Sir Roger Moore needed help to ensure he was able to perform between the sheets. The 007 star has confessed he once tried Viagra – but it did not work. Moore, 86, made the admission during a radio interview as he was asked about his diabetes. He appeared to confuse the blue pills for prescription tablets for his condition. The presenter clarifies the error to Moore who then replies: ‘I once took one [referring to Viagra] it did not work.’ He added the problem had ‘gone’ as he had ‘fixed’ it. Moore was speaking on LBC on Sunday ahead of his new UK tour during which he will promote his latest book Last Man Standing: Tales from Tinseltown. Moore was the longest-serving 007, starring in seven films between 1973 and 1985. He also appeared in TV series such as The Saint and The Persuaders! He retired from acting in 2009. Moore and his wife Kristina ‘Kiki’ Tholstrup divide their time between their homes in Monaco and Switzerland. Like Bond, Moore also enjoyed a martini. But he can no longer drink the ‘shaken, not stirred’ cocktail because of his Type 2 diabetes, he has revealed. Elaborating about his illness and the near-death drama he encountered which led to his diagnosis, Moore told the radio station he now takes ‘blood every morning’: ‘Last November my wife Kristina said to me “You are not well”. She called the doctor and he sent a man round very quickly and a man came with oxygen. ‘He arrived within three minutes and he called an ambulance and within 10 minutes, in my bedroom there was 16 people, including two policemen, firemen, two fire engines outside. The apartment where I live in Monaco, people were calling the concierge and asking if it was on fire. I was carted off to hospital. ‘Where your haemoglobin level should be 14 or 15, mine was down to five. I was going rapidly. They took me off and they searched to find where I had a bleed of some sort and they never found it. I had cameras up everywhere, down everywhere, swallowing them and they can’t find out. The actor, pictured here in 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me with Caroline Munro, left, and Barbara Bach, has been married four times . They put five or six units in me and after about five days I started to feel a little better and now I feel great and now I take blood every morning. It does not hurt.’ Moore was diagnosed with diabetes and has been forced to cut out sugar and no longer drinks. Revealing how he copes with the illness he said: ‘We also have a lovely lady from the Philippines who is a nurse and she puts all the pills I have to take, which are numerous, in little plastic bags. 'I am coping with diabetes but I am a chocolate lover and you can find some without sugar which are for diabetics. 'My wife looks after me and people in the street, they say “God he’s fat”.' Two years ago Moore, a father of three, disclosed how he suffered domestic violence at the hands of two of his former wives. In a candid television interview, the 84 year-old once claimed his first wife, Doorn Van Steyn (above), whom he married in 1946 aged 19, repeatedly punched and scratched him and also threw a teapot at him .

The ice skater, real name was Lucy Woodard who died in 2010, also left him with scars and also punched his doctor as he treated him for a slashed hand, he said. The actor also claimed that his second wife, Dorothy Squires - whom he married shortly after divorcing Van Steyn in 1953 – was also violent and attacked him after learning he had been unfaithful. During his marriage to Squires, whom he divorced in 1968, he also claimed she hit him over the head with a guitar.","Moore, 86, thought radio presenter was talking about his diabetes medicine .

"It seems you are never too young to enjoy a spa day. At least, that's what the Baby Spa in Kensington, London, believes. The unusual venue offers pampering for newborns, including luxury massages and even hydrotherapy treatments tailored just for them. Scroll down for video . Smile! Adorable tot is all grins during his hydrotherapy session at the Baby Spa in Kensington, London . Neonatal and paediatric nurses oversee the treatments, which include water immersion and massages . Laura Sevenus owns and operates the Baby Spa, where tots from as young as two days old have enjoyed her sessions, which include using floating rings to allow them to cool off in a swimming pool. 'Baby Spa creates a calm, soothing and fun experience for both the parent and baby,' Laura, a former South African competitive swimmer, explained. 'It's amazing to watch the intense pleasure, contentment and curiosity the babies of just a few days or weeks old show as soon as they float in the warm water.' According to Laura, the most popular treatment is the use of Bubby floats that allow the tots to rest comfortably on the water's surface. 'The Bubby is a patented flotation device that fits loosely around a baby's neck, supporting an infant of any weight safely and comfortably in the water,' she said. Babies as young as two days benefit from the hydrotherapy and its emphasis on developing range of motion . The flotation ring - called a Bubby - is fitted specifically to each baby to support their weight in the water . 'Once the Bubby is fitted at the beginning of Baby Spa visits, the baby is placed in an individual neonatal pod or larger spa pool for up to 30 minutes of therapeutic immersion.' The babies can then move around freely and have fun in the water, while also developing a larger range of movements. She added: 'The comforting experience strengthens muscles and bone structure, whilst providing an environment where they can build confidence in the water.' Not only is it fun, but hydrotherapy also helps to strengthen muscle and bone structure . The infants are absolutely enthralled by their water therapy, which can improve sleep quality and reduce colic . This hydrotherapy improves the infant's sleep quality and reduces discomfort from colic, wind, and constipation. With regular visits, cardiovascular and respiratory systems also benefit. Massages, where neonatal and paediatric nurses give comforting body rubs to the sound of soothing music, are also available. An avid swimmer, Laura also launched the Sevenus Swimming School in 2000 and hopes that early exposure to hydrotherapy will encourage an all-new generation of water lovers. Spa treatments start at £60 for one hour. Massages are also available, where nurses give body rubs to the sound of soothing background music .","The Baby Spa in London offers hydrotherapy and massages for infants .

Former X-Factor contestant Simone Battle was found by her boyfriend hanged in closet of their Hollywood apartment just four hours after he last saw her alive. The G.R.L. singer was found dead around 8am on Friday morning.

'She was an exuberant person and a very loved person.' Battle's record company and management issued a joint statement on her passing.

"She might be the world's newest monarch but Spain's Queen Letizia clearly hasn't let her style standards slip since taking on the top job. Fresh from a month-long break in Mallorca with her husband King Felipe, 46, she cut an elegant figure as she welcomed President Juan Carlos Varela and his wife to the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid. True to sartorial form, 41-year-old Letizia plumped for a simple white dress embroidered with seed pearl flowers, which she wore with a chic pair of nude patent court shoes and a matching pair of pearl drop earrings. Scroll down for video . Elegant: Queen Letizia was chic in a knee-length cream frock embroidered with seed pearl flowers . Post holiday glow: Both King Felipe and Queen Letizia looked refreshed and happy following their holiday . Also looking elegant was Lorena Castillo de Varela, Panama's first lady, who opted for a tiered mint-green gown but like Letizia, kept her hair and make-up simple. Not to be outdone, both husbands wore dapper suits, with King Felipe accessorising his with a salt-and-pepper holiday beard - a new look for the usually clean-shaven royal. Following their meet-and-greet on the steps of the Zarzuela Palace, the two couples enjoyed a private lunch before the Panamanian president continued on to a meeting with Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy. Although the Spanish royal couple remained at the palace, the visit is the first of an action-packed schedule planned for the next month, including a visit to New York. Hot fuzz: The 46-year-old king returned from his holiday with a beard while Letizia was as glamorous as ever . Back to work: Following a month off in Mallorca, the Spanish royals have returned to a packed schedule . There, the Spanish king will address the UN General Assembly in a bid to secure one of the seats on the Security Council for Spain. The high-powered address is a far cry from the simple pleasures of the past month, which has seen the royal couple enjoy a lengthy holiday on the island of Mallorca where they have a home. Along with their two daughters, Leonor, Princess of Asturias, and Infanta Sofía, the pair spent August enjoying the beautiful island, although the family did make one official visit to the newly UNESCO listed Sierra Tramuntana mountains. Since returning to the Zarzuela Palace, their schedule has swiftly filled up with today's visit following hot on the heels of a trip to the new Picasso museum in the city of Malaga on Sunday.

"Twitter has introduced a new ‘buy’ button that will allow users to make purchases directly through tweets. The button, which is currently only available to a small percentage of U.S. users, will appear at the bottom right of partner tweets in the Twitter apps on iOS and Android. To make a purchase you simply tap the button, review product details and enter your shipping and payment information at the prompt. Once complete, Twitter will send an order confirmation. ‘An an entire purchase can be completed in just a few taps,’ the company boasts in a blog post introducing the feature. Shopping via Twitter: Users can purchase concert tickets and limited edition items such as this T-shirt supporting (RED), a nonprofit focused on fighting AIDS . Twitter has partnered with social shopping platform, Fancy, ecommerce companies Gumroad and Musictoday, and mobile payment startup, Stripe to develop the functionality, and has rolled out the service with a number of notable brands, nonprofits and music artists. Current participants include Burberry, The Home Depot, Demi Lovato, Pharrell, Paramore and (RED), with more to come. For now the feature is focused on selling limited-edition and time sensitive items such as concert tickets and T-shirts, however, a wider variety of products may become available as the button evolves. The company also stressed the measures it’s taken to ensure security of user information. ‘Your payment and shipping information is encrypted and safely stored after your first transaction, so you can easily buy on Twitter in the future without having to re-enter all of your information,’ Tarun Jain, Group Product Manager explains. Social media sales: Current participants in the Twitter 'buy' button include Pharrell (left) and Demi Lovato (right) Designer clout: The social media site will also allow users to buy limited-edition items from Burberry . ‘Of course, you can always remove this information from your account. Your credit card is processed securely and won’t be shared with the seller without your permission.’ It’s a big move for Twitter, experts say, and emphasizes the company's efforts to monetize the service in new ways. The social networking service has previously experimented with ecommerce by allowing users to add products to their Amazon carts by tweeting the hashtag #AmazonCart, and by partnering with Starbucks for their Tweet a Coffee program, which enabled users to exchange $5 gift certificates via tweets. Facebook also announced it had been testing its own buy button back in July, though the feature has yet to roll out globally.","The move marks Twitter’s first foray into e-commerce, and emphasizes the company's efforts to monetize the service in new ways .

"Ariana Grande has seemingly brushed off the controversy that followed her diva antics at a photo shoot with an energetic performance on morning television for her screaming fans. The 21-year-old popstar was rumoured to have stormed off from her first photo shoot in Sydney on Monday after giving photographers an endless list of demands and telling journalists they couldn't ask certain questions. But her antics didn't seem to phase her or the hundreds of adoring fans that turned up to see the popstar as she performed live on Channel Seven's Sunrise program at Sydney's Martin Place early on Tuesday morning. Scroll down for video . Ariana Grande has seemingly brushed off the controversy that followed her diva antics at a photo shoot on Monday with an energetic performance on morning television for her screaming fans . The 21-year-old popstar performed live on Channel Seven's Sunrise program at Sydney's Martin Place early on Tuesday morning in front of hundreds of adoring fans . Ariana, who is in Sydney to promote her album My Everything, performed her hit song Problem in a black one-piece paired with thigh-high boots and a pair of cat ears perched atop her head. Following her performance she spoke to the show's hosts Sam Armytage and David Koch as she kept an eye on her screaming fans outside the studio. 'I've been looking forward to coming to Australia for a long time - I haven't had enough time though,' she said. The American star, who collaborated with Iggy Azalea on Problem, also said she's a huge fan of the Australian rapper. 'I love Iggy, she's very talented I love her music and I was honoured that she wanted to do a song with me.' Just a day earlier Ariana was reportedly displeased with the way she looked on camera and she stormed out on a string of media commitments scheduled to promote her new album. The first photographer of the day had been handed a list of demands, including 'only to shoot the left side' of Ariana's face, and not to use 'natural light.' Media were also handed a no-go list, guiding the  line of questioning, according to news.com.au. Ariana performed her hit song Problem in a black one-piece paired with thigh-high boots and a pair of cat ears perched atop her head . The American singer is currently in Sydney to promote her album My Everything . Following her performance she spoke to the show's hosts Sam Armytage and David Koch as she kept an eye on her screaming fans outside the studio . Ariana, who confirmed she would tour Australian next year, said she had been looking forward to coming here for a long time . The list reportedly stated that Miss Grande could not be quizzed about topics including her love life, Mariah Carey, Justin Bieber and her recently-cancelled Nickelodeon program, Sam & Cat. Ariana's entourage then sent the rest of the snappers home empty-handed even though photographers and journalists had been left waiting in a hotel room for an hour. The popstar eventually re-appeared to answer questions wearing a short navy and gold sequined skirt and black top. When asked if she had any plans to work with Australian rapper Iggy Azalea again, her collaborator on global hit Problem, she replied: 'I just put out this album, slow down a little... I'm just kidding.' The young star has been in the spotlight since she was 14 - as an actress in two Nickelodeon TV shows and with her music career. Ariana stopped to get photos with as many fans as she could outside the studios at Martin Place in Sydney . 'I love Iggy': The 21-year-old opened up about Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, who she collaborated with on her hit track Problem . Ariana said she works hard to protect herself from negative comments. 'I've made it so I don't really have to deal with it. I've sort of created a very safe happy little bubble that I live in where I don't really hear about those things, or look at them, or read them or see them for that matter,' she said. And it seems she attempts to stay in this bubble. 'I've tried to make a very definite separation between my real life and, then, that other stuff. So I don't really let that into my bubble, for lack of a better analogy,' she said, flashing a nervous smile at her entourage. 'I feel like that's the safest route.' Ariana was reportedly displeased with the way she looked on camera and she stormed out on a string of media commitments scheduled to promote her new album . The young star has been in the spotlight since she was 14 - as an actress in two Nickelodeon TV shows and with her music career. Grande recently performed on the MTV Video Music Awards, collaborating with Jessie J and Nicki Minaj on the song Bang Bang. All the focus was on Minaj who spent the time on stage clutching her dress to her body having experienced a reported 'wardrobe malfunction'. Grande claims to have liked this supposedly off-the-cuff moment for the rapper. 'That's a true star. I mean you just go ""OK, I'm naked, let's go."" She killed her verse, she carried on and she went home and celebrated,' she said.","Ariana Grande stormed out of an Aussie photo shoot after ONE photo .

"Six months after her boyfriend went missing on  Malaysia Airlines flight 370, an American woman is losing faith that the plane will ever be found - believing something in the investigation is being covered up. Sara Bajc's boyfriend Philip Wood, 50, was one of 239 passengers and crew on the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, which mysteriously disappeared off radar last March 8. Despite a massive search effort, no sign of the plane was ever found. Now Bajc and other family members of the missing passengers are demanding raw data on the disappearance be released for independent analysis, no longer trusting the Malaysian investigation. Loss: Sarah Bajc's (left) boyfriend Philip Wood (right) was one of 239 people on board Malaysia Airlines flight 370, which went missing last March 8 . Cover up: Bajc believes the investigation into the flight's disappearance is being sabotaged, and that the plane may never be found unless an independent investigation stars. Above, a stock image of a Malaysia Airlines plane . 'I think that if the existing investigation team is left in charge … we may not ever find the plane. Because I believe there are active steps being taken to interfere with finding the plane,' Bajc told NBC News. Bajc says she isn't sure how much is being covered up, but knows something is being concealed. 'Failure to release information - whether its obfuscation, you know, actually covering something up - or dishonesty… creating false evidence or just hiding something, right? We don’t know why or what is being covered up, but something is being covered up,' she added. Fruitless: Australian forces helped lead a search for the plane in the Indian Ocean last Spring which turned up no new clues. Above, Captain Flt Lt Tim McAlevey of the Royal new Zealand Air Force trying to locate the missing plane . She also criticized the Australian governments role in the investigation, after they stepped in to lead Indian Ocean search. She said the Australians should be 'embarrassed' for targeting a dead-end search based on underwater pings, and for not forcing the Malaysian government to release all of their records. Since the search has found no clues as to what happened to the plane, Bajc and the other family members hold out hope that some of the passengers may still be alive, no matter how small a chance. On Monday, many of these family members gathered at the Yonghegong Temple in Kuala Lumper to hold a prayer vigil for the missing passengers. Remembering: On Monday, family members of the missing MH370 passengers father at Yonghegong Lama Temple in Kuala Lumpur to pray on the six-month anniversary of the flight's disappearance . Grief: Above, more family members cry publicly at the prayer vigil at Yonghegong Lama Temple in Kyala Lumpur on Monday . Several  looked overwrought with emotion, as they cried in public for their missing loved one. The fruitless investigation has left Bajc without closure, and she says she will continue to press for answers as long as their is no evidence her boyfriend died. 'I think it’s a very real possibility that Philip is still alive because there is no proof that he’s dead. And so I will continue to push to find proof, one way or the other and at some point in time, if a body is brought to me or even confirmed wreckage of the airplane, then I will acquiesce to the fact that he’s not coming back. 'But until then I will continue to push and many, many family members feel the same,' she said. Pressing for answers: Bajc says she will continue to hold out home her boyfriend survived, until she is given evidence otherwise .","Sarah Bajc's boyfriend Philip Wood, 50, was on flight 370, which disappeared off radar last March .

"An X Factor hopeful who bunked off work for an audition was allowed to keep her job after Simon Cowell phoned her boss and begged him not to sack her. Kerrianne Covell, 23, has already been fired from two jobs after missing work to sing at gigs and was warned about 'going AWOL' by her current boss at Foot Locker in Middlesbrough. Taking matters into his own hands, the music mogul pleaded with the singer's boss after she wowed the judges during last night's show. Scroll down for video . Kerrianne Covell, 23, has been allowed to keep her job at Foot Locker in Cleveland Shopping Centre, Middlesbrough, after Simon Cowell phoned her boss . He left a voice mail message saying: 'Hello, it's Simon Cowell. I'm phoning to apologise actually for Kerrianne not being at work today. 'She has got through to the next round but would like her job back in the short term. 'But if she makes it through, she'll probably never talk to you again. I hope that's ok. Call me, bye.' Ms Covell was a big hit with the panel, after they heard her rendition of Adele's One and Only. The X Factor judge left a message saying: 'Hello, it's Simon Cowell. I'm phoning to apologise actually for Kerrianne not being at work today' She explained her situation, saying: 'I've been fired from two jobs before for singing and missing work to do gigs. 'Foot Locker told me I would be put down as AWOL and could lose my job. 'But I wasn't going to lose my audition. It meant the world to me.' Speaking today, the talented singer said: 'I was allowed to keep my job, they have been so supportive.' A spokesperson from Foot Locker said: 'We can confirm Kerrianne Covell has not been fired or lost her job at Foot Locker, Middlesbrough. Foot Locker fully support Kerrianne in her X Factor journey.' The singer revealed today that she may never have had the chance to perform, as she almost died of severe dehydration during a holiday in Ibiza with her friends. The singer revealed that she is still working at the Foot Locker in Cleveland Shopping Centre, Middlesbrough . She was rushed to hospital where she spent a week-and-a-half in the care of doctors. 'They told my mum, Pam, to prepare for the worst. They didn't say I could die, they worded it differently. 'I was blue-lighted to hospital and the pain was killing me but I didn't have a clue what it was.' Doctors eventually found Ms Covell was suffering from severe dehydration following a water infection. She said: 'I wasn't responding to antibiotics and my kidneys nearly failed. It was really serious and my mum was worried sick.' But the agonising time turned out to be a 'blessing in disguise' for Kerrianne, who was 20 at the time. She quit the Arts Educational School in London, where she was studying musical theatre, and decided to focus on her love of singing. 'That's why I think everything happens for a reason. If that didn't happen I would still be doing musical theatre which, in my heart, wasn't what I really wanted to do,' she said. The talent show hopeful then won a radio competition to support Pixie Lott in concert in Newcastle, and everything has been looking up ever since.

"Tinder has quickly settled a sexual harassment suit brought against the company by one of the app's co-founders. Whitney Wolfe, 24, has been awarded an undisclosed amount of money after claiming she was harassed and forced out of the company when her romantic relationship with Chief Marketing Officer and co-founder Justin Mateen, 28, soured. It has also been revealed that Mr. Mateen is no longer with Tinder, or parent company IAC. Scroll down for video . Tinder tiff: Former Tinder marketing Vice President Whitney Wolfe (center) sued the dating app, claiming sexual harassment and discrimination after she broke up with co-founder Justin Mateen (left) Serious allegations: Wolfe's suit claims co-founder Justin Mateen (pictured here center with executive Jonathan Badeen on right) called her a whore in front of Tinder CEO Sean Rad (left). Mateen is now no longer with the company . 'Whitney’s lawsuit against Tinder has been resolved (without admission of wrongdoing),' John Mullan, a partner at Rudy, Exelrod, Zieff & Lowe, LLP, the firm representing Miss Wolfe, said in an email to BuzzFeed. 'She is proud of her role as a co-founder of Tinder and of the role she played in the app’s success. She is now pleased to be able to focus her energy, talents, and ideas on exciting new opportunities.' Documents released by Los Angeles County Superior Court Monday morning showed that Miss Wolfe dropped the case. In a series of vitriolic texts submitted as part of the lawsuit and seen by MailOnline, Mr. Mateen accused his former lover of being 'heartless,' threatened to 's*** on' a love rival, and berated her for 'flirting' and spending time with Muslim men, whom he referred to as 'Muslim pigs.' In one text he even told Miss Wolfe, 'Ul regret acting this way once my tenderness for you wear off from ur behavior.' In her complaint, filed on June 30, Miss Wolfe stated that Mr. Mateen subjected her to 'horrendously sexist, racist, and otherwise inappropriate comments, emails and text messages.' She was then, ultimately, fired by the company. Textual harassment: In this aggressive text allegedly from Mateen he appears jealous of a younger man with whom he believed Miss Wolfe to have formed a relationship . Torrent of abuse: A series of screen grabs of texts allegedly between Tinder CMO and co-founder Justin Mateen and co-founder Whitney Wolfe form part of her sexual harassment lawsuit. In this one Mateen refers to Wolfe as his 'left overs' Undisclosed sum: It is not known how much Miss Wolfe has received in her settlement . The torrent of abuse to which Miss Wolfe alleged she was subjected to after ending her relationship with Mr. Mateen, which began in February 2013 and lasted until that December, has exposed a culture among Tinder's senior executive which went beyond 'frat-like,' according to her attorney. Mr. Mateen had been suspended in the wake of the allegations, and now a source close to the company, who declined to be identified, has said he is no longer with Tinder or IAC. Miss Wolfe had been seeking compensatory damages, including restitution, lost pay, and punitive damages, in her lawsuit.","Whitney Wolfe, 24, was awarded an undisclosed sum of money just two months after filing a lawsuit against Tinder .

"A Wall Street investor who hoarded designer clothes and expensive silverware in his disheveled rent-controlled upper east side apartment left behind a massive $18 million fortune when he died last year. But his widow of 10 years says she still can't find the documents that detail the fortune's whereabouts because they're buried under piles of paperwork and boxes. Lewis David Zagor, who died in December at the age of 77, made millions on Wall Street investing in cash and mutual funds but chose to live modestly in a relatively small, two-bedroom, rent-stabilized apartment on Park Avenue and 96th Street East, for which he paid $1.641 a month. This photo shows some of the massive quantity of stuff under which Zagor's widow says is buried evidence of his $18million fortune. While he saved on flat expenses, Zagor spent the sizable dividend checks he received from his investments going on shopping sprees at Saks Fifth Avenue and traveling around the globe, according to DNAinfo New York. 'You have no idea the amount of wealth that is in the apartment,' Valentina Phillips-Zagor, his third wife who was with him for the last 10 years of his life, told the website. 'The most important are the financial documents.' She moved into a different apartment on Fifth Avenue and was in going through her husband's flat and cleaning it out. Piles of paper, boxes and garbage litter the floor of Zagor's rent-controlled, two-bedroom, upper east side flat . But before she could get to the home office, where Zagor kept most of his financial information, in May the building's management company, MSMC Residential Realty, changed the locks because she owed rent and wanted to charge her market rates after Zagor died, she said. Phillips-Zagor, 68, refused. Complicating the resolution of Zagor's finances further is the fact that he never made a will, though he apparently has no living relatives other than his wife. Even Zagor's bed isn't immune from the clutter of debris, collected over the 38 years he lived in the apartment . MSMC last month asked a Manhattan judge to appoint a public administrator to oversee Zagor's estate so it could file a lawsuit to recoup back rent, DNAIinfo reported. Phillips-Zagor owes it nearly $5,000, the company claims. She also filed a petition, in which she claimed her husband's estate was worth $18 million and she is the only beneficiary. She is unable to cash any of the dividend checks or access his bank accounts until the estate is sorted. Phillips-Zagor said she's more than happy for MSMC to help sort through her husband's mess. 'I said, 'You go to the court. You go to the apartment and go through the ocean of papers and you will file the petition to become the executor,' she said.","Lewis David Zagor, who died in December, lived modestly in a small, two-bedroom apartment costing $1,640 a month, yet his widow says his Wall Street investments amassed him an $18million fortune .

"Anna Wintour sparked confusion after she was spotted carrying a rather dated looking flip phone last week, but it appears she has traded it in for something more modern. At Carolina Herrera's New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday, the Vogue editor was pictured sitting in the front row clutching a Starbucks cup in one hand and an iPhone in the other. The 64-year-old fashion maven attended the show in a feminine floral dress and her favorite nude slingbacks, keeping warm with a yellow cardigan draped over her back. Scroll down for video . Upgrade: Anna Wintour was seen using a $15 flip phone last week, but today she was pictured sitting in the front row of Carolina Herrera's New York Fashion Week show clutching an iPhone . Selection: Judging by the photos of her today using the up-to-date gadget, it appears she may have a whole collection of phones to pick and choose from . The mother-of-two had people convinced that she was lagging in modern technology when she was pictured using an out-of-fashion flip phone at the U.S. Open in New York on Thursday. She peered out from her signature dark sunglasses to look more closely at the tiny screen on the phone, which looked to be a $15 pay-as-you go phone from AT&T. Signature style: The 64-year-old attended the show in a feminine floral dress and her favorite nude slingbacks . But judging by the photos of her today using a much more up-to-date gadget, it appears she may have a whole collection of phones to pick and choose from. Perhaps she was saving the photo space on her iPhone for snapping pictures at Fashion Week. The flip phone model she was using, an AT&T Z222 GoPhone, has a small two-inch display screen and offers texting and calling but no apps. Old-fashioned: In between cheering on players at the U.S. Open last Thursday, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour was pictured glancing at her cell phone - a rather dated looking flip phone . Odd choice: Her decision to use such an old-fashioned phone is something of a surprise considering Ms Wintour presumably has the most cutting-edge products at her fingertips . Retro: The 64-year-old was seen peering out from her signature dark sunglasses to look more closely at the tiny screen on the phone, which appears to be a $15 pay-as-you go phone from AT&T (pictured) Her decision to use such a simple and inexpensive was something of a surprise considering Ms Wintour presumably has the most cutting-edge products at her fingertips. By Mark Prigg . Anna Wintour is believed to be using the AT&T Z222, a retro-styled 'flip' handset available on AT&T's pay as you go 'GoPhone' service for just $14.99. It offers texting and access to some email accounts - but no apps. It's unlikely Wintour is able to take a decent snap either - the handset only has a VGA camera with a resolution of less than a megapixel - far less than those found in modern phones. AT&T boasts it will 'bring a nice balance of features and design to your fingertips.' Perhaps the editor, who is known to be a creature of habit, simply likes to stick with what she knows best. Indeed, back in 2004 she was seen using a similar flip phone while watching a Michael Kors runway show, although that particular model looked even more retro with an antenna. By 2007, she graduated to a somewhat sleeker model - the Motorola Razr, which she brandished proudly at yet another fashion show. From 2009 to 2012, Ms Wintour was pictured multiple times using a Blackberry, and it seemed she had finally found a modern phone she liked. And just last year, she was seen carrying around both a Blackberry and an iPhone, a symbol of her busy business life. So it's a mystery as to why she would have downgraded back to a flip phone to watch the tennis this year. Still stylish: Sitting next to Hugh Jackman at the match, she looked typically chic in a floral patterned dress and maroon cardigan, her hair styled in her usual sleek bob . Sitting next to Hugh Jackman at the match, Ms Wintour looked typically chic in a floral patterned dress and maroon cardigan, her hair styled in her usual sleek bob. The usually steely mother-of-two let her guard down to cheer excitedly for the tennis players, throwing her fists in the air and smiling at each exciting moment of the match. The lively experience was likely a welcome break for Ms Wintour, who had been busy preparing for New York Fashion Week, which officially began on Thursday. As arguably the most respected editor in the fashion industry, she has been observing many of the big shows from the front row. Though it may be easy to mock Ms Wintour's low-tech choice of phone, she may actually be on the money. A recent trend observed by MailOnline has seen classic 1990s models by Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola commanding four-figure sums on eBay and other resale sites. While they may lack features, these retro phones are simple to use, have batteries that last the week and are practically indestructible compared to their smartphone equivalents. ‘Some people don't blink at the prices, we have models at more than €1,000 (£810 or $1,360),’ said Djassem Haddad, who started the site vintagemobile.fr in 2009. ‘The high prices are due to the difficulty in finding those models, which were limited editions in their time.’ French online shop Lekki, which sells a range of vintage, revamped mobile phones, claims simplicity is the way forward. ‘Too many online social networks and an excess of email and applications, have made us slaves to technology in our everyday life,’ it said on its website. ‘We have two types of profiles: the 25 to 35 year-olds attracted by the retro and offbeat side of a telephone that is a little different, and those who are nostalgic for the phone that they used when they were younger,’ said Maxime Chanson, who founded Lekki in 2010. ‘Some use it to complement their smartphone, but others are going for the vintage, tired of the technology race between the phone makers.’ Here are some of the retro phones making a comeback: . Motorola StarTac 130: A model launched in 1998 - and repainted bright orange was recently offered for €180 (£145 or $245). Ironically, the trend is just starting as the telecommunications industry throws such handsets into the recycling bins, hailing smartphones as the way ahead. Motorola StarTac 130, $245 . Nokia 8210: Has a tiny monochrome screen and plastic buttons, at €59.99 (£48 or $80). Finnish firm Nokia, the biggest mobile phone company before the advent of Apple's iPhone or Samsung's Galaxy, offloaded its handset division to Microsoft this year after failing to catch the smartphone wave . Nokia 8210, $80 . Nokia 8800 Arte Gold: Currently listed  for €1,000 (£810 or $1,360), while a Nokia 8800 could be purchased for €250 (£200 or $337). Nokia 8800 Arte Gold, $1,360 .",The Vogue editor was seen in the front row at Carolina Herrera's New York Fashion Week show clutching a Starbucks cup in one hand and an iPhone in the other .
"Olive Garden's limited number of 'never-ending pasta passes' sold out in two hours today, the company announced on Monday afternoon. The $100 golden ticket allows carb lovers to fill up on as much of the chain's signature dishes as they can eat. From 3pm today, fans of the chain were able to buy a ticket to eat as much pasta as possible - along with bread sticks, salad bar and soup - for seven weeks between September 22 and November 9. Only 1,000 of the passes were sold and covered the 150 pasta dishes available at Olive Garden from five-cheese ziti al forno to lasagna classico and spaghetti meatballs. An Olive Garden location in Peoria, Illinois. The chain is offering a never-ending pasta pass which lets the holder eat as much pasta as possible over seven weeks at any U.S. location . Only 1,000 of the passes are being made available and covers the 150 pasta dishes . The deal also includes unlimited soft drinks for the pass-holder and those at their table - but no alcohol. The pass can be used once a day (but also every day) at Olive Garden locations across the U.S. The attention-grabbing promo comes at a tricky time for the chain. In July, the CEO and Chairman Clarence Otis stepped down as the Darden Restaurants company fights to fix its flagship Olive Garden chain following its contested sale of Red Lobster. For fans of the Olive Garden chain, getting value for money from the $100 pass should be simple - and done in under a week. Using only options available on the pass, a dinner of minestrone soup followed by spaghetti meatballs, a house salad and bread, typically costs roughly $36 (before tip). Sticking to the pass's one use, once-a-day rule, then Olive Garden fans can chomp their way through $100, in just three sittings. The company, based in Orlando, Florida, has been pressured to turn around declining sales at Olive Garden and Red Lobster. Customers had begun turning away from those chains as they cut back on spending during the recession. Darden Restaurants Inc. completed the sale of Red Lobster to investment firm Golden Gate Capital in July. There has also been concern from diners over the calorie contents of those bottomless pasta bowls. Olive Garden boasts a significant amount of meals that have more calories, saturated fat and sodium than is recommended - and even more than a McDonald's value meal, according to a Drexel University-University of Pennsylvania study in January. The Herb Cheese Soffatelli with Chicken (1,530 cal and 107g of fat) and Pork Milanese (1,510 cal and 87g of fat are two of the highest calorie items on the Italian chain's menu. All you can eat: The pass allows the diner to eat as many pasta dishes as they want from the Olive Garden chain over a seven-week period .","Company announced on Monday afternoon that the limited number of passes had sold out in two hours .

"A woman who was dubbed the 'ugly duckling' has finally beaten her bullies by undergoing a nose job. Jessica Leigh, from Rochester, Kent had always been tormented for the shape of her nose but now claims that her bullies have made her more beautiful. The 20-year-old had suffered torment from a young age and unlike most bullying it didn't end as she got older with the teasing continuing even after finishing high school. Scroll down for video . Jessica has changed her life around and beaten her bullies after having a nose job . Jessica says that the constant goading made her lose all of her self-esteem. 'I had spent all my life feeling like the ugly duckling, I was bullied throughout school because of my big nose. 'I was constantly picked on by the popular girls at school, I was made to feel different and gradually my confidence disappeared. 'Even when I left school and started college, the bullying continued.' For Jessica the shape of her nose had not only resulted in vicious teasing but had also stood in the way of her dream career with the 20-year-old quitting her modelling job as she didn't feel pretty enough. Jessica had always been dubbed the 'ugly duckling' and let her nose get in the way of her modelling career . Jessica finally decided to go in for surgery after having breathing difficulty in a yoga class . After finally building up the confidence to pursue her modelling career after years of teasing, it was seeing her head shots that bought Jessica's confidence to an all time low. 'My modelling dreams were crushed when I saw a photograph of my side profile. I knew I wouldn't make it in the modelling world with a nose like mine, so I gave it all up. 'It hit me like a tonne of bricks, my confidence plummeted after that.' Despite having considered corrective surgery her whole life, Jessica didn't turn to it until a Yoga class confirmed what she saw as the necessity of the procedure. 'I was taking lessons in how to teach yoga when I realised that I couldn't breathe properly. Jessica's boyfriend Kev (right) proposed a week before she went in for surgery and the 20-year-old is looking forward to planning her wedding now she is happier with her appearance . 'The one side of my nose had a defect that meant I couldn't pass as much oxygen through it when breathing out.' With her decision made Jessica booked her rhinoplasty. This was not a decision that Jessica made lightly and after years of consideration she was careful to do plenty of research before settling on a surgeon.

Jessica did plenty of research before finally settling with plastic surgeons MYA, she is thrilled with the results . The surgery was not cheap costing Jessica £3,500, but the 20-year-old was determined to fund the procedure herself paying half up front, with the rest being on finance.

'I gave myself a few months to prepare for surgery as I had a few holidays booked beforehand.' She was so thrilled with the results and couldn't wait to show off her new nose. 'I am like a completely different person since my surgery. 'I smile more and I can honestly say I'm a happier person.' It isn't surprising that Jessica is happier than ever, with her boyfriend Kev Pender, 27, recently proposing.

"Gordon Brown launched a passionate and last-ditch attempt to save the faltering Union last night. In a dramatic return to frontline politics, the former prime minister issued a timetable for Scottish ‘home rule’ in the event of a No vote in next week’s referendum. His intervention came as another poll confirmed surging support for independence and the pound took a beating on the currency markets. Billions of pounds were also wiped off the value of Scottish-based firms in what experts warn is a taste of things to come if the 300-year-old United Kingdom is broken up. Mr Brown said his cross-party package of measures giving Scotland greater control over spending, welfare and taxation could be in place by the end of next month and in operation by the end of January. Scroll down for video . During a speech, the former Prime Minister spoke about plans for a timetable to give the Scottish Parliament more powers if voters reject independence next week . Impassioned: Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke at the Loanhead Miners Welfare and Social Club in Midlothian, Scotland . Mr Brown emphatically stated 'a No vote on September 18 will not be an end point but the starting gun for action' during today's rally at the Loanhead Miners’ Welfare in Midlothian . Trying to revive the lacklustre Better Together campaign, he said: ‘The future that is being decided is for ten, 20, 50, 100 years ahead. ‘We are making a decision that is irreversible. I’m thinking about the children of Scotland and future generations of children. It’s more important than one voting decision in an election.’ Amid growing panic in the No camp: . - Cabinet ministers warned privately that David Cameron’s future will be ‘very difficult’ if Scotland votes for independence next week; . - The Prime Minister told MPs that several Nato partners had used last week’s summit in Wales to raise concerns about the independence referendum; . - Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman warned Scots that the ‘risks of going it alone are huge’; . - Prince William gave a hint of royal unease, urging people to focus on ‘big domestic news’ rather than the announcement that he and the Duchess of Cambridge are expecting a second child. After a weekend poll showed the Yes camp moving ahead for the first time, another survey today confirms a late increase in support for independence. It is now backed by 41 per cent among those certain to vote, level with the No camp on 41 per cent. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown with his wife Sarah out on the streets of his home town Kirkcaldy, Fife. They are campaigning for the Better Together side in the run up to the Scottish Independence Referendum . Pressing the flesh: Gordon Brown with his wife Sarah. They met retired policeman Roy Nicol in Kirkcaldy, Fife . The remaining 18 per cent who say they will definitely take part in the September 18 referendum are undecided, according to the TNS survey. This suggests the fate of the Union lies in the hands of 600,000 wavering voters. A year ago the No campaign was ahead by 22 points. Yesterday, the pound fell by about 1.3 per cent against the US dollar to a ten-month low of $1.61 – and economists predicted a further, more dramatic slump in the event of the Scots voting to leave the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron, leaving 10 Downing Street today, has agreed to hand more powers to Holyrood if Scottish voters reject independence . British government debt was also shunned by international investors as separatists threatened to default on their share if they are not allowed to keep the pound. The market value of RBS, Lloyds and Stagecoach, fell by more than a combined £2billion. Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: ‘Investors had dismissed the prospect of a Yes vote as an outlier, but recent opinion polls have shifted that perception and this has been no better demonstrated than by the plunge in sterling today. ‘One thing is certain, if we get this sort of volatility on the prospect of a Yes vote, can you imagine the reaction if we do get a Yes vote? It’s not likely to be pretty.’ Hollywood star Alan Cumming (centre left) joins with Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (centre right) to campaign for the yes vote in Glasgow today - despite not living in the country or being able to vote . Appearing at a rally in Midlothian last night, Mr Brown proposed that a cross-party agreement on further powers for Scotland should be reached by St Andrew’s Day and draft laws ready by Burns Night, on January 25 next year. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who is facing mounting criticism over the collapse in support for the Union among Labour voters, immediately backed the intervention from his predecessor. Speaking to the TUC in Liverpool, he promised that an incoming Labour government would ‘act immediately’ on further devolution. Though Chancellor George Osborne trailed an announcement on a cross-party agreement on a devolution timetable at the weekend, there was surprise at Westminster that Mr Brown had made it. Mr Cameron is not thought to have been consulted beforehand, but Downing Street last night welcomed Mr Brown’s proposals. All three main Westminster parties have previously promised new powers for Scotland on tax and welfare in the event of a No vote, but differ on the details. That inconsistency has been seized on by the nationalists who say the offers are a smokescreen. Better Together campaigners gather in the Grassmarket listen to Jim Murphy Shadow Secretary of State for International Development, as he continues his 100 towns in 100 days tour against independence .","'No' vote would be the 'starting gun' for further powers for Holyrood .

"It's arguably Paris's most iconic landmarks. However one couple got more than they bargained for when seeing the Eiffel Tower all lit up at night. A creepy face at the top of the 988ft structure was caught on camera by holidaymaker Lisa Dingley, who travelled across the channel to celebrate her 32nd birthday. She noticed the 'skull' while sitting on a wall with her boyfriend Philip Morgan at the entrance of Jardin des Tuileries - two miles from the famous landmark. What an Eiffel! The top of the tower looks like a skull, or a 'creepy face' in Lisa's photo . Miss Dingley, of Birmingham, West Midlands, spotted the face straight away and thought it was a giant skull looking back at her. She said: 'The face on top of the tower reminds me of a skull. 'I noticed that it looked like a face immediately and showed it to my partner, Philip. Lisa Dingley took the amusing photo while travelling to Paris with Philip Morgan . 'We were both amazed and had to look at it several times - it was clearly a face. 'I thought it looked creepy and I am sure some people will agree with me. 'Philip also thought it was a very strange photograph. Everyone who has seen it exclaims ""there is a face!""' The photograph was taken at 10pm, during the tower's first light show of the evening.","Lisa Dingley was on holiday with boyfriend Philip Morgan when she took pic .

"Transgender model Andreja Pejic has launched a Kickstarter campaign in the hopes of funding Andrej(a), a documentary about her extraordinary transformation from an androgynous-leaning male to full-fledged female. The 23-year-old icy blonde chose to go public with the news of her sexual reassignment surgery earlier this year, and now reveals it was against the advice of her agents. It's still too soon, she says, to tell whether her career will suffer as a result. 'I hope that by sharing my humanity, pain, tears, laughter, joy, and biggest struggles on film, it will shed light on what it means to live as a transgender individual,' Miss Pejic says. Scroll down for video . Appeal: Transgender model Andreja Pejic (pictured) has launched a Kickstarter campaign in the hopes of funding Andrej(a), a film which will explore her life following her recent sexual reassignment surgery . Kickstart-it: The documentary is shot by her filmmaker friend Eric Miclette, and already consists of two years of footage leading up to, and during, her transition. The team need $200,000 to continue . Miss Pejic and her filmmaker friend Eric Miclette have already been shooting footage for the documentary for two years, covering her last few photo shoots as a male model, her sexual reassignment surgery and her big reveal to the public. In order to film the next six months, the team is appealing for $200,000 in funding, and have so far raised $16,733, with 32 days left on the clock. Miss Pejic - who rose to fame as an androgynous male model - is still unsure as to whether the fashion industry will accept her as a female, or whether much of her appeal will now be lost. This upcoming chapter, she says, will be crucial to the documentary. Then and now: Miss Pejic was born a boy and grew up in a war-torn refugee camp in Serbia (left). She later moved to Australia and was scouted while working at McDonald's. Pictured (right) two weeks ago . Defining moment: Miss Pejic chose to go public with the news of her sexual reassignment surgery earlier this year (pictured), and now reveals it was against the advice of her agents . A trailer for the film sees Miss Pejic look back upon her humble beginnings as a young boy growing up in a Serbian refugee camp, her family having been 'torn apart' by war. Miss Pejic later moved with her mother, with whom she is very close, to Australia; where she was discovered by a talent scout - true to cliché - working in McDonald's. After New York Magazine put her, (then, him) on its cover in 2011 and crowned her 'The Prettiest Boy in the World,' Miss Pejic's niche had seemingly been set in stone. Candid: 'I hope that by sharing my humanity, pain, tears, laughter, joy, and biggest struggles on film, it will shed light on what it means to live as a transgender individual,' Miss Pejic says . Looking good: Miss Pejic is still unsure as to whether the fashion industry will accept her as a female, instead of an androgynous male. Pictured last week (left) and in April (right) 'If she wanted to remain a success, she had to remain a boy,' her Kickstarter campaign reads. 'Her agents said it. The press said it. The world expected it. Most importantly, her family relied on it.' Speaking to The New York Times last week, Miss Pejic said: 'There are agents that would tell me: ""Don’t ever do it. Don’t transition. You’ll lose everything”.' But transition she did, and this weekend, Miss Peijic announced she had left her former agency, DNA, to join The Society - an all woman's agency - as a solely female model. On Saturday, she posted her new photo card to her Instagram account with the caption: 'New agency! New life!' 'When I was little, I dreamed of being a girl. In fact that was my biggest dream,' Miss Pejic says in a scene from her trailer, seemingly shortly before her life-changing surgery. 'It's a goal I've had my whole life. It's all been kind of leading up to this.' In a following photo, she is sprawled out on a hospital bed, hooked up to an I.V., and in one scene, she is hunched up in a hotel room weeping, and muttering: 'I really miss my mom.' In another, Miss Pejic dives into her agonizing decision as to whether or not to tell people, her agent included, about her transition post surgery. Male past: At the height of her popularity, Miss Pejic was championed for appearing to exist between genders. Pictured in 2012 (left) and in 2013 (right) 'We live in a world that doesn't like, trust, or respect transgender people,' she says. 'It felt like there were two options for me. 'I could transition, forget about my past, hide it, live in fear. Or I could be proud, share my story with the world and hope that it does some good.' Ultimately, it was Eric Miclette who convinced Miss Pejic  to not only tell her agent and her business associates, but to tell the whole world her story. 'This is a powerful part of an immensely courageous journey, we need to film this!' she recalls him telling her. 'You know how many trans people - and people in general - are out there hiding, forced to live as someone they are not? You could give them hope by going public about this.' Category defining: In 2011, Miss Pejic walked the runway during the Jean-Paul Gaultier women's show as part of the Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week Spring/Summer show (pictured) Miss Pejic claims to have turned down offers from 'large global networks,' eager to swoop in on her story, but has opted to go down the road of independent film making instead, so as to 'maintain creative control.' She insists that she and her team are contributing their own money to finish the documentary, but can't afford to cover the full costs. Miss Pejic is offering a variety of rewards for healthy donations, including signed merchandise, a Google Hangout with herself; or, for pledges of $10,000 or more, tickets to attend a show with her at London Fashion Week. Whether Miss Pejic will appear in any of the shows herself, at this week's New York Fashion Week or in London, Paris or Milan, is a question left hanging. If all goes ahead with the documentary however, these are the sorts of answers we can expect to have answered in intimate detail as the next chapter of her life unfolds.","Miss Pejic was born a boy and raised in a Serbian refugee camp .

"A costume worn by child star Judy Garland during the making of the classic film The Wizard of Oz is expected to sell for £180,000. The 'test' dress and pinafore was one of several that were made for Garland while producers experimented with how they wanted her character Dorothy to look in the 1939 movie. The outfit was the first of the prototypes made to feature a blue and white Gingham pinafore - a feature the producers stuck with for the final dress design. A costume worn by child star Judy Garland during the making of the classic film The Wizard of Oz is expected to sell for £180,000. The 'test' dress and pinafore was one of several that were made for Garland while producers experimented with how they wanted Dorothy to look in the 1939 film . Although Garland, who was 17 at the time, never wore the dress on film, several photographs exist of her wearing it on set. The images will be sold alongside the outfit at an auction dedicated to film memorabilia. The rare outfit was bought by a private party when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the film studio which made The Wizard of Oz, held a sale of their costumes in the early 1970s. It has since been passed among several collectors, and is one of the most sought-after film costumes on the market. The film launched 17-year-old Judy Garland's acting career . The original dress sold at auction in November 2012 for $480,000 - around £290,000- and another prototype dress sold the year previously for $910,000 - or £550,000. Catherine Williamson, head of entertainment at Bonhams, said: 'This dress is an early design of the one that was finally worn in the film. 'There were several variants made before they settled on the one we all know from the film. 'It doesn't appear on screen but we do have stills of Judy Garland modelling it. They took pictures and then the producers would take a look and see if they liked it or whether they wanted to make more tweaks. The original dress was sold off by the film studio in the 1970s, reaching £290,000 at auction in November 2012 . 'The important thing about this particular dress is that it features a gingham apron. That was a big moment for the producers when they decided that was the look they wanted to go for. 'The dress itself didn't work but they loved the blue gingham - and that's how we got to the dress that was used in the film. It was the last step. 'This dress helped create the enduring image of the Dorothy we know and love. 'This dress was sold off by the film studio in the 1970s and it has had more than one owner. The present owner has had it for less than 10 years. 'There is a huge demand for Wizard of Oz memorabilia - it is universally beloved and visually stunning. The costumes are unique and material from the film is some of the most collectible in the marketplace.' The auction will take place in New York on November 24.","Dress was an early design of the gingham pinafore dress worn in the movie .

"Britain’s smallest man fell victim to an hilarious prank during his Ice Bucket Challenge as his family concocted a plan that resulted in him being soaked by two buckets of water. Michael Henbury, the 2ft 11in actor best known as a Harry Potter goblin, completed the challenge in support of his friend Kevin Lamb from Southampton who is receiving treatment for myeloma cancer. Mr Henbury, who was nominated by a colleague at the UK Border Force in Southampton, said it had been agreed that only a small bucket of water would be appropriate because of his small size. In the video the entertainer's nephew Simon Leah, 10, is seen pouring a small bucket of water over Mr Henbury. The star then subsequently suggests the challenge was not as difficult as he had anticipated. He said, 'Nothing to it really' and adds, 'I don't know what all the fuss was about; it was quite easy.'

"The Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy could help save the Union, polling experts said today. The royal couple's decision to reveal Prince George will have a sibling could stir a late swell of support for keeping the United Kingdom together with ten days until the knife-edge vote. A new poll today revealed many voters demanding an independent Scotland, or still undecided about the issue, want to keep the Queen as head of state. Within minutes of Kensington Palace's announcement today there was speculation about whether the Duchess' second pregnancy could be the boost the stuttering 'no' campaign needs and sway voters. Could the baby save the Union? The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured in Scotland in May, could influence the outcome of the independence ballot because many no voters consider themselves monarchists . Titles: The royals have strong links with Scotland and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge use their titles of the Earl and Countess of Strathearn whenever they are there (pictured on a distillery tour this summer) Support: Alex Salmond congratulated the couple today using their Scottish titles. He says the Queen will remain head of state if he wins but others in his party disagree . A YouGov poll yesterday put support for independence at 51 per cent, with the No camp on 49 per cent. The Better Together campaign has surrendered a 22-point lead in the space of a month. On the back of this the Queen held talks with David Cameron yesterday amid panic at the prospect of the end of the 300-year-old Union, and there is said to be ‘great concern’ at Buckingham Palace about the result. Experts said today that Her Majesty's  worries and news of the royal baby could mark a key point in the campaign. A spokesman for ComRes told MailOnline: ‘The Queen is generally very popular in the UK and so are the young royals like the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, probably more so than Prince Charles for example. ‘The royal family has not really played a part in the referendum debate until now but the Queen’s reported concerns and now Kate’s pregnancy will bring that into focus. ‘There are a number of reasons why the poll could swing back to no. It won’t be just because of the baby, but that and other issues about the royal family could influence the result’. The Queen, pictured at the Braemar Gathering in Scotland, is thought to be strongly in favour of the Union and will be in Scotland on September 18 – the day it could vote to break away from the rest of the UK. Her influence could save the Union . Leader of the 'Better Together' campaign and former British minister Alistair Darling  argues with Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond during the second live television debate on Scottish independence. The two sides are neck-and-neck . But a poll in The Times today found that 40 per cent of yes voters say an independent Scotland should keep the Queen. A further 14 per cent of undecided voters are also monarchists. However it also emerged that yes voters are more anti-monarchist that first thought even though Alex Salmond has pledged that the Queen would stay as head of state. But the SNP’s John Mason and others are  calling for a referendum to replace the monarch after Her Majesty steps down or dies. On a recent visit Kate and William were showered with gifts for their baby son, Prince George, including this mini kilt (right) made from local Strathearn tartan . The royals have strong links with Scotland, with the Queen always spending her summers at Balmoral. A senior royal source was quoted as saying: ‘The Queen is a Unionist. Lots of people were telling us that it was going to be OK but there is now a great deal of concern.’ In May the Duchess of Cambridge – using her Scottish title the Countess of Strathearn – visited Scotland. Kate and her husband, also given the title Earl of Strathearn by the Queen on his marriage, were on a visit to the country’s oldest distillery, Glenturret, home to The Famous Grouse Experience. David Cameron, at Balmoral yesterday with the Queen, was expected to reassure her that in the closing days of the campaign he intends to make the ‘emotional argument’ about all that England and Scotland have achieved together and what ‘we can continue to achieve’. Pro-Union MPs said her presence at Balmoral would be a sign of continuity. ‘There is a strong anti-monarchy element in the Scottish National Party,’ said former defence secretary Liam Fox. ‘You can bet your bottom dollar as soon as they get independence, their next target is going to be Scotland being a republic.’ Sources have confirmed that the monarch will continue with her annual holiday at her private estate in the Highlands, on September 18. The Palace insisted that the Queen was politically neutral, but one well-placed source said: ‘You don’t have to be a genius to work out the Queen is a Unionist. Is the Pope a Catholic?’ A Palace spokesman said: ‘The referendum is a matter for the people of Scotland: the Queen remains strictly neutral on this, as she does on all political issues. The Queen has maintained a close interest in the referendum as she does with all major matters of public debate and is being kept informed by her ministers and officials in the usual way.’","New poll reveals that many 'yes' or 'undecided' voters still want a Queen .

"The average British person spend 315 days a year hungover. Many surveyed said they had missed dates, job interviews and even funerals as a result . Recovering from a big night out? The average British person spends almost a year of their lives nursing a hangover, a charity has said. Macmillan Cancer Support has estimated that people spend 315 days of their lives battling with headaches and nausea caused by drinking. The charity surveyed 2,000 British adults and found that one in 14 will have more than 3,000 hangovers in their lifetime. It calculated the figures by multiplying the average amount of time people spend hungover each month with their life expectancy. The new poll  revealed a north-south divide with the frequency of hangovers, with 22 per cent of people from the north likely to have more than four hangovers each month compared to 15 per cent of people from the south. Women's hangovers appear to last longer - with the average lasting nine hours - compared to a seven hour hangover suffered by men. The study suggests that being hungover could jeopardise your chance of finding romance or getting your dream job. One in every 13 of those surveyed said they had missed a first date because they were too hungover and one in ten said they had missed a job interview. Shamefully, eight per cent of those surveyed admitted they had missed a wedding thanks to a hangover, and six per cent admitted they had missed a funeral. Over half said the most annoying aspect of being hungover was that it made them feel sick while more than a quarter said wasting time was their biggest bugbear. Of those who complained about a hangover being a waste of time, a quarter said if they weren't hungover they'd have more sex. A hangover also prevented people from taking part in more edifying activities. A further 16 per cent said they'd learn a language, 41 per cent said they'd exercise more and 13 per cent said they'd learn an instrument. Forget hair of the dog, an Iraqi stew from a 1,000-year-old Middle Eastern recipe book claims to be the 'ultimate hangover cure'. The 1,000-year-old Iraqi dish involves cooking meat with vegetables and spices, and then adding something known as 'kashk'. Kashk is combination of fermented yoghurt, milk and whey, and is common in Iranian, Turkish, Balkan and Arabic food. The ancient book also advises eating cabbage before going out drinking. The charity is running a 'Go Sober for October' fundraising campaign to encourage people to give up drinking and raise money. 'This research shows hangovers are a waste of time and are causing people to miss out on everything from romance to their dream job,' said Hannah Redmond, head of national events marketing for Macmillan Cancer Support. 'That's why we're asking people to sign up for Macmillan's Go Sober fundraising event, abstain from drinking alcohol for the month of October and ask family and friends to sponsor them. The money raised will provide vital funds to support people affected by cancer so they don't have to face it alone.' To find out more about the campaign visit gosober.org.uk. Half of respondents to the survey complained that being hungover was a waste of time.

"Sarah Andrews was resigned to feeling ill forever. For four years she lived with debilitating bouts of dizziness, distorted vision and chronic tiredness, with doctors at a loss to explain what was wrong. Sarah had also become sensitive to light and noise. ‘Gradually my symptoms became more and more frequent until they occurred daily and meant I couldn’t work for ten months,’ says Sarah, 42, a customer service adviser who lives in Liverpool with her partner Ian, 49, who works in retail. She had been back and forth to doctors dozens of times and wrongly told she had everything from the ear complaint labyrinthitis to chronic fatigue syndrome to vertigo. For four years Sarah Andrews, 42, lived with debilitating bouts of dizziness, distorted vision and chronic tiredness. Her symptoms were actually migraines, brought on by the early stages of the menopause . The correct diagnosis, when it finally came, was a surprise. Her symptoms were actually migraines, brought on by the early stages of the menopause. ‘I hadn’t had any other menopausal symptoms, such as night sweats or hot flushes,’ says Sarah. ‘And I had no idea migraines could be a sign of the menopause or that migraines could occur without a headache.’ Many women, like Sarah, are unaware that the onset of migraines, or experiencing more frequent or severe migraines, can be a sign the menopause is approaching — but experts say it’s surprisingly common. The problem is that these women may not necessarily develop headaches — the symptoms vary widely and can include visual disturbances such as seeing flashing lights and zig-zag lines, fatigue, neck pain, mood change, poor memory, restless legs, dizziness and sensitivity to light and noise. Usually these occur in the days preceding the headache — known as the premonitory phase of the migraine — but in some people the headache never strikes. ‘I regularly see female patients in their 40s whose migraine became chronic, meaning they occur on more than 15 days each month in the lead up to the menopause,’ says Dr Nick Silver, a consultant neurologist from the Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust in Liverpool, who treated Sarah. ‘Often they haven’t realised they are perimenopausal. Some have never had migraine before.’ The perimenopause — when women start to experience menopausal symptoms — lasts, on average, for four years before a woman stops having periods and the menopause starts. Research recently presented to the American Headache Society found women get as many as 60 per cent more migraines in the years before and at the start of the menopause, and that along with hot flushes and depression, migraine can be a symptom of the menopause. There is a strong hormonal link to migraines — which may explain why women are more likely to get them than men. The perimenopause — when women start to experience menopausal symptoms — lasts, on average, for four years before a woman stops having periods and the menopause starts . And, says Dr Silver, it’s not just when a woman is menopausal — migraines often occur at stages of hormonal change, but because they can bring a variety of symptoms they can be easily overlooked or misdiagnosed. ‘Oestrogen drops in the middle of the menstrual cycle and just before each period starts, which are the most common times for migraine to occur in women,’ says Dr Silver. ‘When a girl’s periods first start, they may experience a headache and/or a form known as abdominal migraine — causing predominant tummy pain. 'Because they can occur without headache, this can sometimes be dismissed as period pains.’ Many women find their migraines improve during pregnancy when the hormones remain relatively constant. After pregnancy, however, they often return, but the symptoms, which can include fatigue and depression, may be mistaken for post-natal depression especially as these symptoms can seem more prominent than a headache. ‘Women may be given anti-depressants unnecessarily, but because they can improve migraine in some people, they think a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis was correct, though other treatments may be more appropriate,’ says Dr Silver. But it’s not just these women who get misdiagnosed. Dr Silver says: ‘Up to 80 per cent of migraine and headache disorders may be given the wrong diagnosis,’ and often people mistakenly get told they have psychological problems or even stress instead. Migraine is a disorder of brain nerve cells and receptors. When they function inappropriately they can cause increased sensitivity to light and sound. When it comes to treating hormone-related migraines, there’s some disagreement among specialists. ‘When evidence clearly shows women are having migraine related to hormones, for example during the perimenopause or at the start of every period, an oestrogen gel which stabilises oestrogen levels can be prescribed by GPs,’ says Professor John Studd, a former consultant gynaecologist at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, West London. ‘This virtually always stops migraines for good. But not enough people are treated with it as they should be, because neurologists and GPs often try preventative anti-migraine drugs instead. 'They aren’t aware of the oestrogen treatment or don’t always realise the migraines are linked to hormones. ‘Women put up with a lot of suffering without treatment.’ Migraine is a disorder of brain nerve cells and receptors . However, Dr Silver disagrees and believes hormone treatment should typically be a last resort, saying it can occasionally be risky and have side-effects. Instead, he says these patients should be treated the same as others with migraine. Changing lifestyle factors can dramatically improve migraine in 40 per cent of patients, he says — this includes drinking more water, eating meals regularly, sleeping and waking at the same time each day, avoiding caffeine (in coffee, tea, green tea, cola and chocolate) and regular use of painkillers. If this doesn’t help, the next options are drugs such as candesartan, propranalol or topiramate that are also used to treat epilepsy and high blood pressure or anti-depressants which work on chemical messengers in the brain. Botox injections are also used and are thought to reduce pain signals from various receptors to the brain. ‘When none of these measures work we can look at hormonal treatments, usually a low-dose HRT patch,’ says Dr Silver. HRT works like oestrogen gel, to balance out levels of oestrogen in the body. Some may also contain a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone. However, in women under 50 who experience problems with aura — usually visual disturbances such as flashing lights or zigzag lines — this treatment doubles their risk of stroke, although the overall risk is still very low. Most women with hormone-related migraines will find they stop or become less frequent after the menopause. Sarah finally discovered what was causing her crippling symptoms when a physiotherapist helping with her balance issues told her she had migraine-associated vertigo, not headaches, and referred her to Dr Silver. By then, her migraines had taken over her life. ‘Ian and I used to travel and socialise a lot but by then we couldn’t even watch telly together because the screen would set me off, and I couldn’t stand any noise without it causing pain,’ says Sarah. Migraine is a disorder of brain nerve cells and receptors. When they function inappropriately they can cause increased sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine is among the three most prevalent health conditions worldwide, along with anaemia and hearing loss. Severe migraine attacks are classified by the World Health Organisation as among the most disabling illnesses, comparable to dementia, quadriplegia and active psychosis. It is the least publicly funded of all neurological illnesses relative to its economic impact. In the UK there are an estimated 190,000 migraine attacks every day. ‘Sometimes my fatigue was so bad I’d sleep for 14 hours and then by the time I got down the stairs I’d feel exhausted again.’ When Dr Silver looked back through her medical history, he could see she had been having hormone-related migraines earlier in her life. 'Sarah hadn’t realised what it was, but as a teenager she had felt ill on the first day of each period for a couple of years. ‘I would get awful stomach ache which I thought were just period pains.’ she says. ‘I’d never thought they were migraines as I didn’t have headaches, but looking back I realise they were — as well as abdominal pain, sometimes I saw flashing lights, my hearing would go, and I’d feel sick and faint.’ When Dr Silver explained the link between her latest symptoms and the menopause, it immediately made sense. ‘Shortly after the dizziness and visual symptoms started, my periods became lighter and less regular — signs of the perimenopause,’ explains Sarah, whose mother and grandmother both had an early menopause at 40. As she was under 50 and experienced migraine aura she was not given HRT, but tried a number of treatments that didn’t work. However, since last August she has found taking candesartan blood pressure pills, prescribed by Dr Silver, combined with Botox, acupuncture and reflexology has reduced the severity of her migraines, so she can now work from home and socialise again. ‘My life still isn’t back to normal,’ says Sarah. ‘I never knew the menopause could trigger anything like this, or that migraines could be so debilitating.’ ■ migrainetrust.org .","Sarah Andrews suffered debilitating migraines for fours years .

And today, many parts of the country were affected by flash flooding, resulting in several streets being left underwater and residents evacuated from their homes in the Lincolnshire town of Louth, while downpours also led to waterlogged roads in Maidstone, Kent.

"James Cross, 55,was offered experimental treatment after suffering a heart attack in February . After James Cross had a heart attack in February, he was given a unique chance for a new life. Surgeons at the London Chest Hospital offered the 55-year-old experimental therapy that involved injecting his own stem cells into the damaged organ. This was done in the hope that it would encourage his heart to repair itself. The injected stem cells should prevent the heart’s muscle tissue from becoming increasingly damaged after suffering a lack of oxygen during the heart attack. And it seems to have worked. ‘After the heart attack, I had 21 per cent of my heart muscle functioning, as opposed to the normal 61 per cent,’ says James. ‘When I was tested a few months ago, that figure was up to 37 per cent and I believe it’s still improving.’ Researchers behind the new technique hope it will increase the survival rate from heart attacks by a quarter. James, from Hornchurch, East London, is now back working at his family landscaping business with his sons, Jimmy, 31, and Danny, 28, and goes to the gym regularly. His treatment is the latest in a new wave of stem cell therapies that could become everyday treatments for many conditions. Stem cells have been discussed for more than 15 years as a future ‘cure’ for many ills. But concerns about the use of stem cells taken from embryos slowed up their introduction. These issues have been overcome, mainly because scientists have discovered how to transform adult patients’ bone marrow cells into stem cells. So now they are being used in a multitude of ways. Surgeons now use stem cells as a treatment for strokes, blindness, cancers and arthritic hips and knees, as well as a way to grow artificial blood for emergency transfusions. Stem cells — the basic ‘building block’ form of the cells that make up our bodies — are capable of developing into different tissue types, and those from bone marrow can now be made to grow, or ‘differentiate’, into heart muscle cells. When James was offered the chance to try the new treatment it seemed too good an opportunity to turn down. Before his heart problems, James ate healthily, drank only occasionally and never smoked. But he had suffered extreme emotional trauma. ‘The medical team believe that the heart attack was caused by the stress of seeing my 16-year-old son, Sam, die in a light aircraft crash at Southend airport in 2006,’ he says. ‘I used to go to bed crying and wake up crying.’ On the night of the heart attack, James awoke at 2am with pain in his left side. When it intensified, his wife Yvette, 52, drove him to A&E. He was then taken by ambulance to the London Chest Hospital, where an emergency team waited. Surgeons at the London Chest Hospital injected stem cells, pictured, from Mr Cross's hip into his heart in the hope that it would help the organ repair itself. The treatment appears to have worked and Mr Cross's heart muscle function has improved from 21 per cent after the attack to 37 per cent and it is still improving . ‘I was petrified,’ James says. ‘I had an out-of-body experience, where I saw my dead son and my father looking at me, shaking their heads, as if to say it wasn’t my time.’ The surgical team inserted a small tube called a stent into the narrowed coronary artery, which was causing the heart attack, to widen it and restore blood flow. A day later, James was visited in the intensive care unit by experts seeking the first patients for their heart stem-cell experiment, called the bone marrow acute myocardial infarction trial (BAMI). James was among the first of 3,000 participants in a Europe-wide study. All are to be treated within five days of a heart attack in the hope of increasing survival rates. ‘I was only the second person in the UK to have had it done,’ says James. ‘The morning after, they came and took bone marrow from my hip to obtain my stem cells. ‘It hurt for a second, despite the anaesthetic, but it was fine once the needle was in fully.’ The next day surgeons put a tube into a wrist artery and ran it into his heart. They injected a syringe of stem cells, then stopped the blood supply to his heart for a second, so the stem cells would be deposited there. ‘They did this seven times with seven syringes. I was awake all the time, and it wasn’t traumatic,’ says James. Within hours, he was up and about. Now he feels entirely recovered. The BAMI study aims to see if it is a result of the stem cell injections, or whether James may have recovered this way anyway. But James, who will be monitored for five years after the treatment, is convinced he’s benefited. ‘I feel brilliant,’ he says. Anthony Mathur, director of cardiology at Barts Health NHS Trust and professor of cardiology at Queen Mary University, is the BAMI chief trial co-ordinator. He says it will be four to five years before doctors know definitively whether adult stem cells from bone marrow can repair damaged hearts. Elsewhere in London, surgeons are pioneering stem cell therapy for stroke patients. Last month, the researchers from Imperial College London reported that all five patients in the trial were alive and three were living independently at home six months later. Four of the patients had the most serious type of stroke. Mr Cross, pictured with his wife Yvette and sons Jimmy and Danny, will be monitored as part of the study for five years . Normally, only one in 25 such patients is able to live independently after six months. Each had stem cells extracted from their bone marrow. These can grow into blood cells and cells that line blood vessels. The stem cells were injected into an artery supplying blood to the brain. Scans of patients’ brains found that damage caused by the stroke had reduced over time, although similar improvements may also be seen in stroke patients as part of the normal recovery process. A handful of UK patients have had stem cell treatment to restore sight to one eye that had been damaged or blinded by trauma. This is done using cells taken from their good eye. ‘We have performed this on 25 patients, and in all cases it has been successful, with patients experiencing a significant reduction in visual impairment,’ says lead researcher Francisco Figueiredo, professor of ophthalmology at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle and Newcastle University. Meanwhile, surgeons at Southampton General Hospital are injecting stem cells and ‘biological glue’ into patients who have torn the cartilage in their hips and knees. It is hoped the stem cells can save joints from developing arthritis or needing to be replaced. Dusko Ilic, senior lecturer in stem cell science at King’s College London, says: ‘We are still in very early days. The best successes have been with very simple tissues, such as cartilage. ‘It will take five to ten years before we really understand what can be done in the future. I don’t think we’ll ever be able to use stem cells to regenerate all the organs and tissues of a human.’ Nevertheless, lab studies on animals indicate there are still further possibilities for future stem cell therapies. For example, Stanford University investigators have taken skin cells from three infertile men and converted them into stem cells. When transplanted into the testes of mice, these cells developed into early-stage human sperm cells. The research shows it may be possible to restore male fertility by injecting cells into infertile men’s testes. And, at the University of Utah, treatment with human stem cells has allowed mice crippled by a version of multiple sclerosis to walk again after less than two weeks. A similar outcome in humans could help patients in potentially disabling stages of the disease, says the study in the journal Stem Cell Reports.","Father-of-two James Cross, 55, suffered a heart attack in February .

"In May 2012 Lesley Maloney's symptoms began to get gradually worse, until she was in constant pain . Sitting in a chair might not sound like a particularly special experience — but for Lesley Maloney, it’s bliss. She is recovering from a two-year battle with a spinal condition, which made sitting excruciatingly painful. ‘It was like sitting on a golf ball with nails sticking out of it,’ says Lesley, 58, who lives with her sales manager husband, Ged, also 58, in Wetherby, West Yorkshire. Lesley’s symptoms began gradually in May 2012, and worsened over several weeks, until she was in constant pain. ‘It was always there, though standing and lying were easier than sitting,’ says Lesley. Her misery was compounded by her job as a junior school teacher. ‘I sit with the children and have lots of meetings — my days were filled with pain and, often, I resorted to standing instead,’ she says. Along with pain while sitting, Lesley also experienced severe pain down the outside of her left thigh. ‘I’d been running a lot, so I thought it might be some kind of back injury related to that.’ After suffering for about six weeks, Lesley went to a physiotherapist who diagnosed piriformis syndrome, where the piriformis, a muscle in the buttock, irritates the sciatic nerve, which runs through the buttock and into the leg. But physiotherapy, cortisone injections — designed to reduce inflammation — and osteopathy all failed to help. She then saw a skeletal and sports consultant who gave her an MRI scan, but couldn’t see anything wrong, and diagnosed nerve damage. She was told to rest, and her GP prescribed a painkiller-releasing patch. Lesley hoped the pain would pass but, instead, it got worse. ‘Sitting was unbearable without a cushion,’ she says. ‘I’d take one everywhere and try to make light of it, saying, “I’ve not got piles!”’ But it was no joke — daily life became a struggle. ‘I coped with my job — it offered some distraction — but could do little else,’ says Lesley. ‘Our social life ground to a halt.’ In June 2013, she returned to her GP and pleaded for another scan. This time, the bottom of her spine was scanned and doctors found what’s known as a Tarlov cyst. Tarlov cysts, also known as perineural cysts, are named after the late American neurosurgeon Isadore M. Tarlov, who first documented them. They are found on the roots of spinal nerves, which are covered by a protective sheath. When the spinal fluid that surrounds the spinal column finds a weakness in the sheath, it balloons out, forming a cyst. The cysts can compress nearby nerves, causing a range of problems, including pain around the tail bone and buttocks, or the perineum, and pain in the legs. Other symptoms include bowel and bladder problems, such as constipation or needing to urinate too frequently, and, in women, painful sexual intercourse. Tarlov cysts can form anywhere along the spine, but tend to be found in the sacral area at the base, which is why sitting can be so painful. Over time, they can erode the bone of the sacrum, causing further pain. Up to one in ten of us is thought to have a Tarlov cyst, but they cause symptoms in fewer than five per cent of cases. The cysts vary in size — usually from a few millimetres in diameter up to a couple of centimetres — and many patients have more than one, says Adrian Casey, a neurologist and spine specialist at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore. At 5cm across, Lesley’s cyst was very large. Women are affected far more than men, although it isn’t known why, says Mr Casey. The now 58-year-old was initially diagnosed with piriformis syndrome, which irritates the sciatic nerve which runs through the buttock and leg . Tarlov cysts are usually identified using MRI scans. Also known as perineural cysts, they are named after the late American neurosurgeon Isadore M. Tarlov, who first documented them. They are found on the roots of spinal nerves, which are covered by a protective sheath. When the spinal fluid that surrounds the spinal column finds a weakness in the sheath, it balloons out, forming a cyst. The cysts can compress nearby nerves, causing a range of problems, including pain around the tail bone and buttocks, or the perineum, and pain in the legs. Other symptoms include bowel and bladder problems, such as constipation or needing to urinate too frequently, and, in women, painful sexual intercourse.

The cysts vary in size — usually from a few millimetres in diameter up to a couple of centimetres — and many patients have more than one, says Adrian Casey, a neurologist and spine specialist at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore. It is thought that people with connective tissue disorders, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which affect the tissue supporting the organs and other parts of the body, may be predisposed to developing Tarlov cysts. Trauma — a fall, for example — may also cause an unproblematic cyst to become a problematic one, by increasing spinal fluid pressure, further inflating the cyst. Tarlov cysts can be identified clearly using MRI scans. However, as Lesley found, cysts that cause problems are often misdiagnosed, because the symptoms overlap with other conditions, such as piriformis syndrome and nerve damage. Mr Casey says he sees Tarlov cyst patients from around the country whose cases have perplexed other doctors. In Lesley’s case, once the cyst was identified, she was referred to a pain management and spinal consultant, who suggested draining the cyst via a hollow needle. ‘Big mistake,’ says Lesley. She found the hour-long procedure agonising and derived no benefit, because the cyst refilled. In desperation, Lesley searched online for answers and found the website of Dr Frank Feigenbaum, a Texan neurosurgeon who was widely regarded as the world expert on Tarlov cysts. He is keener on surgery than other doctors, and operates in the U.S. and at a centre in Cyprus. Lesley emailed her MRI scan to Dr Feigenbaum’s office, and was delighted when he called back. But when her pain worsened Mrs Maloney, pictured with her husband Ged, also 58, returned to the doctors and was finally scanned in June 2013. It revealed she was suffering a Tarlov cyst, which was pressing on nerves in her lower back . ‘It was fantastic to have this world expert ring little old me in the UK,’ she says. ‘He had my scan in front of him and said, “Yes, I can help you”.’ Meanwhile, however, Lesley had seen another British spinal consultant, who was convinced the Tarlov cyst was not the problem. He diagnosed ischiofemoral impingement syndrome, in which pain is caused by abnormal contact between two bones in the pelvic area — the ischium and the top of the femur or thigh bone. Lesley was left not knowing what to do. She knew treatment with Dr Feigenbaum would cost a whopping £28,000 — and that her medical insurance would only cover half the cost of treatment abroad. So initially she persisted with the British doctor. He referred her to another spinal consultant, who recommended a large cortisone injection. ‘It made a bit of difference, but not much,’ says Lesley. ‘I said to the doctor, “Where do we go from here? I cannot live with this pain.” He said, “You must — plenty of people do”.’ Lesley decided Dr Feigenbaum was her only hope. So she and Ged, who have two grown-up sons, flew to Cyprus in April. Dr Feigenbaum’s technique involves making a six to nine centimetre incision in the back, popping the cysts to drain them, and then identifying the weak point in the membrane. He mends this area with stitches, then ‘shrink wraps’ the cysts with an artificial membrane to ensure they cannot re-expand. The op usually takes two to three hours. According to Dr Feigenbaum, the main problem with the treatment of Tarlov cysts is that many doctors have been taught that they don’t cause symptoms. Mrs Maloney flew to Cyprus in April with her husband Ged to have surgery on the cysts. Her surgeon Dr Feigenbaum's technique involved making an incision in the back and popping the cysts to drain them . ‘Some patients are even told they’re crazy and imagining the pain,’ he says. He has even treated patients who have been misdiagnosed and undergone unnecessary surgery, such as a hysterectomy. Mr Casey says he uses a similar technique to Dr Feigenbuam and that this is available in the UK, on the NHS or privately. ‘The British approach is simply more cautious about surgery, due to the risks involved,’ he says, adding that surgeons here prefer pain management in all but the most severe cases. Dr Feigenbaum has operated on more than 800 patients, Mr Casey about 30. The risks of surgery include spinal fluid leaks and injury to the nerve. Lesley was aware of the risks, but had complete faith in Dr Feigenbaum. ‘He filled me with confidence,’ she says. The surgery was successful and Lesley was off all painkillers by day three of her ten-day stay in Cyprus. ‘The difference is unbelievable,’ she says. ‘I’m 95 per cent recovered already.’ She is exercising again, but taking it easy. ‘Dr Feigenbaum says it takes about a year for the nerves to settle,’ she says. According to Dr Feigenbaum, about 70 per cent of his patients report improvements in the most common symptoms. Mr Casey admits that British spine surgeons may have much to learn from Dr Feigenbaum, but wants him to share details of his complication rates to help doctors and patients better understand the surgical risks. ‘I’ve invited him to the UK next year,’ he says. ‘We’re keen to see his results.’","Lesley Maloney, from Yorkshire, was diagnosed with piriformis syndrome .

"Michael Cull has endured a decade of pain because of his two-stone leg . A pensioner who has been branded a modern day 'Elephant Man' has been given fresh hope for treatment of his debilitating disease. Michael Cull, 66, has endured a decade of pain after his left leg ballooned to more than two stone in weight, leaving him incapable of walking and making him the target of cruel taunts from strangers. The retired Nasa computer technician from Rosehearty, Aberdeenshire, accused the NHS of turning its back on him earlier this year after being told there was nothing that could be done to treat his condition. But he is now optimistic that he might finally be on the brink of a life-changing operation after being referred to a specialist in the north of England. He said doctors in Hull were discussing surgery to remove the deformed tissue from his lower leg and return it to a more manageable size. 'I am absolutely elated that all these years of pain may be coming to an end,' he said. 'It looks like I'll be going to Hull for the operation - it can't come soon enough for me. Finally, things are being put in place. 'As far as I know, it's a surgical procedure to remove all the tissue on the lower part of my leg. 'It will mean a big improvement to my life, it will bring things back to normality.' Scroll down for video . However, because he is Scottish, and the treatment is in England, Mr Cull's operation may not be able to go ahead if Scotland votes for independence. This would be devastating, as his condition means he finds doing regular things like cooking, taking a bath or going up stairs extremely difficult. It looks like Mr Cull's nightmare could finally be over, because specialists believe surgery can treat him . Mr Cull cannot board a plane, and finds regular things like cooking, taking a bath and going up stairs very hard . His nightmare started after a car accident while he was living in London. Despite attempts to halt the growth of his leg with stockings after he moved to Scotland, it continued to swell. The condition has now spread from his toes up to his hip, leaving his leg lumpy and deformed. It was only after he contacted First Minister Alex Salmond directly that he was referred to a consultant in Dundee last year. It was suggested he had elephantiasis, a disease found in third world countries, and is the stage of lymphedema at which the lymph channels are almost completely blocked. Mr Cull says he rarely leaves his home in because he was in so much discomfort - and when he did he was often the butt of 'Elephant Man' jokes in the street. 'People call me all sorts of things, like Elephant Man. It makes me really depressed,' he said. 'My trousers ride up when I walk so there is no way I can hide it. It affects my leg, foot, and toes. I can’t wear socks because I can’t get them on. Nothing will fit me.' But he added that previous press attention means he was glad he had spoken out. 'People have been a lot nicer, more friendly, they have been a lot more understanding,' he said. 'I think it has made the medical professionals move a little bit quicker, too.' He said he hoped to hear from his doctor again in the next week and expects to travel for surgery in the next month. 'I still don't know what it is. I think, after all this time, I'd like an answer to that, too,' he said. 'My message to anyone else suffering from a condition like mine is to make a nuisance of yourself, keep on top of the doctors. 'I see some of these other procedures people have on the NHS - cosmetic surgery and the like - and I just think that is totally wrong when I had to wait for so many years.' Mr Cull's leg is currently so big that he cannot even board a plane, as the seat space is too narrow for his leg, but now he is able to look to the future. 'I plan on doing a bit of travelling when I'm all fixed up. I've been stuck here for so long that I just can't wait to get going again,' he said. Elephantiasis is normally caused by a parasite from a mosquito bite and is usually found in tropical parts of the world, like India or the Amazon, where Mr Cull grew up. It is characterised by massive enlargement of an area of the body and is caused by the obstruction of the lymphatic system. This results in the accumulation of fluids in the affected part of the body. According to the World Health Organisation, nearly 1.4billion people in 73 countries worldwide are threatened by the condition, which is also known as lymphatic filariasis. WHO figures suggest that approximately 80 per cent of these people are living in Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Nepal, Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania. Over 120million people are currently infected, with about 40 million disfigured and incapacitated by the disease, the organisation claims. The most famous person to suffer from a form of elephantiasis was Joseph Merrick, better known as the Elephant Man. In 1884, after four years in a workhouse, Merrick contacted a showman and proposed that he should exhibit him. His managers then named him Elephant Man and he was eventually sent on a tour of Europe. He returned to Britain and became well known in London society after he went to live at the London Hospital. Merrick died in 1890, aged 27. It is reported he died from a dislocated neck when he lay down to sleep, because of the huge weight of his head.","Michael Cull, 66, has been living in agony for a decade with condition .

"When the hot summer months arrive, most people dream of having a big pool in their garden to splash around in - and Mila the hippopotamus is no different . The female resident of Kaliningrad zoo, in west Russia, recently broke out of her enclosure in search of greener pastures - after going months without a working waterhole. The 14-year-old mammal was eventually caught staring longingly into the elephant enclosure where her neighbour enjoys a luxurious deep plunge pool. Not impressed: Mila, the 14-year-old hippopotamus broke out of her enclosure in search of a pool after overheating in the summer heat . Zookeeper, Uliana Nekrasova, said: 'There have been some problems with her own pool which has been out of action for most of the summer. 'We have a hose and we do our best but the main plunge pool is out of action.' Keepers realised she was missing when they went to her enclosure at feeding time and found it empty, but they have insisted there was no danger to the public. A zoo spokesman said: 'Mila was found only 100 metres from her own enclosure and she is normally a very sweet-natured animal. 'She wasn't being aggressive. She was just curious and took her chance to look around.' Jealous: The female hippo was found by keeper, Uliana Nekrasova, looking longingly at the elephant's plunge pool at the Kaliningrad zoo in west Russia . Belly flop: Mila's pool is currently being fixed meaning she will be able to cool down in the comfort of her her own enclosure . 'We are tackling problems with her own enclosure so she won't need to go walkabout again.' Hippopotamuses love water, which is why the Greeks named them the 'river horse'. In Africa, they spend up to 16 hours a day submerged in rivers and lakes to keep their massive bodies cool. The mammals can also be dangerous and unpredictable when disturbed, and are responsible for more deaths in Africa than any other animal.","Unhappy Mila, 14, went in search of new home as her pool was out of action .

"Handwriting is so unique to an individual, it can be used in court to identify suspects and victims. But what would happen if you took all the different ways people around the world write the Latin alphabet letters and combined them into a single font? That was the thinking behind pen maker Bic’s latest experiment - but the result is a basic, and somewhat childlike, typeface. French pen maker BIC analysed 868,496 characters from handwriting from 112 countries to create an average typeface alphabet (pictured). The alphabet can be explored by gender, age, country and handedness . Recent research from the . National Pen Company in the U.S., found that a person's  handwriting can give away clues . about 5,000 different personality traits. These traits are revealed based on the way people space their letters, how they sign their name, and even how they connect the letter . 'o' and 's' to other letters in a word. For example, people with small handwriting tend to be . shy, studious and meticulous, whereas outgoing people who love . attention will have larger handwriting. If handwriting slants to the right the . person is open to new experiences and enjoy meeting new people. If . handwriting slants to the left, that person tends to keep themselves to . themselves. Procrastinators tend to dot their 'i's . and 'j's to the left of the base letter, while child-like personality . types will draw their dots as circles. To begin analysing the world’s . handwriting, France-based Bic asked people to contribute their . handwriting to the Universal Typeface Experiment site. The firm used software to plot the shape and motion of each letter, and has analysed a total of 868,496 characters from 113 countries at the time of writing. This was taken from more than 400,000 samples. Each of these letters were placed on top of each other to find the typical shape and motion, and these were used to form an average letter - shown on the site in yellow. The alphabet can be explored by gender, age, country, handedness and industry. The darker the shading behind a letter, the more uniform it was written across contributors, while the lighter the shading, the more freeform the handwriting. This shading is also determined by how many people from that country and industry contributed handwriting. The number of characters used to form the average letter is shown beneath each one. The darker the shading behind a letter, the more uniform it was written across contributors, while the lighter the shading, the more free-form the handwriting. Left-handed people tend to write letters more narrow than right-handed people . Although the writing style between the UK and U.S, for example, is very similar across the entire alphabet, there are dramatic differences between Angola and American Samoa. In the latter (pictured left) the line through the letter 'F' is wavy, while the style of the Angolan 'F' (pictured right) is more fluid and curved .

"Hungry diners may argue about pizza toppings, but most people agree the cheese on their pizza should look golden, taste great and have just the right amount of elasticity. Now food scientists have identified the best combination of cheese to ensure an optimal amount of stringiness and flavour. And they say that a mixture of mozzarella and cheddar makes for the perfect pizza. The secret to grate pizza: Food scientists have identified the best combination of cheese to ensure an optimal amount of stringiness and flavour on pizzas. They say that mozzarella can be mixed with other cheeses such as cheddar to make 'gourmet pizzas' Scientists at the University of Auckland evaluated different cheeses - mozzarella, cheddar, colby, Edam, Emmental, Gruyere, and provolone - to see how well they melted. They evaluated how the cheeses’ composition and texture affected how well it browned and blistered – a desirable quality for pizza toppings. Elasticity, oil content, moisture, water activity and ‘transition temperature’ all influence the colour uniformity of cheeses, they explained in the study, which was published in the Journal of Food Science. The scientists found that blisters – the . dark spots seen on cheese – didn’t form using cheddar, colby, and Edam . cheeses because of their small elasticity. Scientists at the University of Auckland evaluated different cheeses - mozzarella (pictured left), cheddar (right), colby, Edam, Emmental, Gruyere, and provolone - to see how well they melted . A sufficient amount of ‘free oil’ prevents moisture evaporation, so Gruyere and provolone did not brown easily, while Emmental would not go golden at all. ‘These cheeses can be combined with the easily blistering mozzarella to create a gourmet pizza with a less burnt appearance,’ they said. This is the first study to look at the composition of the ideal pizza, without relying on humans’ taste buds, the researchers said. They have developed a computer vision technique to help manufacturers make better pizzas. Last year, a mathematician devised a formula for the 'perfectly proportioned' pizza, taking into account factors like the ratio of topping to base. She said that pizza lovers get more topping per bite in a smaller pizza, but a more even spread of bites in a larger pizza. Size matters: A mathematician believes that a larger pizza must have a larger base to compensate for most spread-out toppings, while a smaller pizza needs a thicker base . A mathematician claims to have come up with the first-ever formula for the 'perfectly proportioned' pizza, taking into account factors like the ratio of topping to base. Dr Eugenia Cheng said pizza lovers get more topping per bite in a smaller pizza, but a more even spread of bites in a larger pizza. The mathematician from the University of Sheffield, calculated a ratio to ensure maximum flavour of topping to base. It shows that even if a person keeps the same amount of dough and topping, the ratio of topping to base in an average bite changes with the size of the pizza and smaller pizzas typically have more topping per bite than larger ones. Dr Cheng said it is not only about how thick the base is, but about the balance of flavours between the topping and the dough that determines how much topping an individual can enjoy per bite. She used d as the constant volume of dough and t for the constant volume of topping to come up with a mathematical formula for the ratio of topping to base in a median bite. Dr Cheng calculated that in relative terms, the average bite taken from an 11 inch pizza has 10 per cent more topping than the average bite from a 14 inch pizza. The mathematician came up with these formulas as she was asked by chain restaurant Pizza Express to work out why its 14 inch Romana pizzas, which have a thinner and crispier base than the Classic 11 inch pizzas, are proving so popular.","University of Auckland scientists evaluated different cheeses, such as mozzarella, cheddar Edam and Gruyere, to see how well they melted .

"A former unpaid intern is suing CBS and David Letterman's WorldWide Pants production company for payment for her four months of unpaid work at Letterman's late-night show. Mallory Musallam, 26, who interned at the show for four months between September and December 2008 accuses the defendants of violating minimum-wage and overtime laws. Musallam filed the class action lawsuit in the New York Supreme Court on Thursday on behalf of every unpaid Late Show intern from the past six years. Unpaid: Mallory Musallem, 26, is suing CBS and David Letterman's production company WorldWide Pants . Compensation: The NYU graduate claims the defendants violated violated New York minimum wage and overtime laws and wants wages, with interest, plus legal fees . According to documents obtained by Deadline, Musallam claims that the defendants intentionally minimized their labor costs by giving work to unpaid interns instead of hiring additional employees or paying regular staff overtime to do it. Additionally, she charges that she typically worked more than 40 hours a week but did not receive any payment or vocational training in exchange. According to an online resume for Musallam, at the Late Show she 'helped research celebrity guests, dubbed videos, worked on a telephone switchboard, acquired integral information for show content, and helped with any other research-related tasks.' Denial: A CBS spokesman has said the network will 'vigorously defend against the claims' by Musallam . The lawsuit is seeking wages, with interest, and legal costs 'owed to Named Plaintiff and all similarly situated persons,' a group that the suit claims 'is believed to be in excess of 100 individuals.' Musallam, who writes in her blog that she loves 'all things pink', Nicole Richie and 'muscular boys,' also has listed internships at Entertainment Tonight, The Insider and W magazine, but has only filed a suit against CBS. The network says it will defend itself against Musallam's claims. 'This lawsuit is part of a nationwide trend of class action lawyers attacking internship opportunities provided by companies in the media and entertainment industry,' as CBS spokesman said. 'We pride ourselves on providing valuable internship experiences, and we take seriously all of our obligations under relevant labor and employment laws. We intend to vigorously defend against the claims.'","Mallory Musallam, 26, is has filed a class-action lawsuit against CBS and David Letterman's production company .

"Women in a small Yorkshire town have been revealed as the worst learner drivers in the country. Five female drivers in Heckmondwike, West Yorkshire - which has a population of about 17,000 people - have taken a staggering 158 practical driving tests between them. The unnamed women, aged between 35 and 48, have forked out almost £10,000 trying to pass - placing them among the top 20 worst learner drivers in the UK. One determined woman in the town took 34 attempts to succeed, while two unnamed learners took 32 tests. Watch out: The West Yorkshire town of Heckmondwike is home to some of the worst learners in the country ¿ all of them women . The other two women struggled through 29 practical driving tests before passing on their 30th attempts, according to figures revealed by a Freedom of Information request to the Driving Standards Agency (DSA). It is believed this could be due to Heckmondwike's narrow, rural roads, bad surfaces and busy junctions - although local driving instructors have refused to comment. Driving test routes in the area also feature the notorious Gildersome Roundabout, deemed the most dangerous roundabout in West Yorkshire. The small town has an extremely low driving pass rate of 39.8 per cent - more than seven per cent below the national average of 47.1 per cent. And it would appear female learners are mostly to blame - with only 35.3 per cent of women in the town passing the practical test, compared to 45.7 per cent of men. The practical driving test, lasting about 40 minutes, costs £62 to take on a weekday or £75 on an evening, weekend or bank holiday. Mark Peacock, head of BSM Driving School, said: 'It seems unusual that Heckmondwike has proved so troublesome for these learners, but there are many factors that can influence someone's success at their driving test. 'In particular, nerves can play a big part in how well someone performs, which may well be the case for those who have made serial attempts.' According to the data, three of the top 20 worst learner drivers in the country took their tests in Bradford - less than eight miles from Heckmondwike. And two women took a whopping 69 attempts between them in Middlesbrough. Failure figures: One woman in the town took 34 driving tests, and two other learners took 32 . The record number of practical driving tests was held by a determined 40-year-old, who was deemed fit to drive on his 37th attempt. The unnamed man, from Stoke-on-Trent, forked out at least £2,294 trying to pass - which could have paid for a decent second-hand car. Meanwhile, a young woman has recently set a new record for flunking the driving theory test.The unnamed 28-year-old, from London, has sat the test 110 times - spending a staggering £3,410 trying to pass. The test, costing £31 a time, includes a 57-minute multiple-choice exam and a hazard perception element. It is unknown whether the determined Londoner managed to pass on her 110th attempt - but, either way, she still has the practical test to overcome. And it's not just ordinary people who struggle to gain a driving licence. Infamous learner Maureen Rees, from the BBC's Driving School, passed on her seventh attempt, while Ozzy Osbourne claimed to have taken 19 attempts to succeed because of his battle with the booze. The DSA says, on average, it takes about 45 hours of professional training and 22 hours of private practice to pass the practical driving test. A DSA spokesman said: 'Pass rates can be influenced by various factors. 'Some people may take more lessons and be better prepared for the test. 'Statistical factors can also play a part as the number of tests conducted at different test centres varies significantly. 'However, every driving test is conducted to the same strict requirements. 'We train examiners to a high standard and closely monitor their work to ensure that all tests are assessed consistently across the country.'","Apart from hilly roads, there is nothing obvious about the driving conditions in Heckmondwike to explain why so many learners struggle to pass .

"Hells Angel David Richards was allowed to 'simply walk out' of a prison before going on the run for nine years . A convicted killer was allowed to 'simply walk out' of a prison before going on the run for nine years while managing to claim benefits and take holidays abroad, a court heard. Hells Angel David Richards should have triggered a manhunt after he absconded from Sudbury open prison in Derbyshire in 2005. The 53-year-old had been serving a life-sentence after being jailed in 1984 for hacking a teenager to death and using his blood to write 'Hells Angels' on a wall. After his escape local police refused to launch a search and simply logged his disappearance on a national database. Richards was only recaptured after the Daily Mail was tipped off about him, traced his whereabouts and spent a week urging police to act. In the meantime Richards was able to rent a flat, claim thousands in disability benefits and even went to Ireland on holiday after managing to obtain a passport. Shockingly, while in Ireland he was jailed for three months for robbery without anyone even realising he was on the run from an English prison. A court heard the killer - who had served 21 years for murder - was only recaptured on June 6 this year. The Metropolitan Police were tipped off that he was living at an address in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, and arrested him at the property. On Friday Richards was jailed for another two-and-a-half years at Wolverhampton Crown Court after admitting escaping from custody. Sentencing Judge Philip Parker QC said the only appropriate sentence was a return to prison. He added: 'The fact you were in an open prison when you decided to walk out must have meant you were relatively trusted. 'It may have been that you would have achieved release on licence at some point thereafter. 'I am told that, after your escape, you returned to the West Midlands where you remained until your arrest by police. 'Any escape is serious and if the person concerned is serving a sentence of life imprisonment it creates alarm and fear amongst the general public.' Murder victim: Michael Groves, left, with his younger brother Marcus. David Richards and his girlfriend attacked Michael with a wrench, hammer and knife before writing 'Hell's Angels' on the wall with his blood . The judge said, that as a result of his escape, Richards was now being held in a more secure prison and the prospect of his release had been severely jeopardised. He added: 'The sentence I have passed merely marks the offence you have committed and it does not indicate when it would be safe to release you. 'That is a matter for the parole board.' The court heard it was not immediately clear how Richards was able to claim benefits despite his status as a wanted man. Prosecuting Tariq Shakoor said: 'He must have been deemed to be a dangerous offender because he was not subject to release until the parole board deemed it safe to do so. Convicted killer David Richards was allowed to 'simply walk out' of Sudbury Prison before going on the run for nine years while managing to claim benefits and take holidays abroad, a court heard . 'Sudbury is a Category D prison and he simply walked out of the grounds.' Simon Hanns, defending, said his client, who appeared in court on crutches, walked out of Sudbury in frustration at waiting so long to be released. He said: 'He went to Ireland and then moved back to Wolverhampton where initially he was caring for his parents. 'They were in ill health but subsequently it has been him who has been unwell. 'The dangerous offender of many years ago is a far cry from the man who stands before you today.' Richards was jailed for life 30 years ago for the drug-fuelled murder of 16-year-old Michael Groves at his flat in west London. He attacked the teenager with a knife, hammer and wrench - leaving him with 56 injuries before writing 'Hells Angels' on the wall in his blood. Richards was sentenced to at least 16 years, but was deemed so dangerous that he was still in Sudbury Prison, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, in 2005 - 21 years later. After his latest arrest his parents Eric and Patricia Richards said they thought their son had been freed and were shocked to find out he was a wanted fugitive. Speaking from their £200,000 semi-detached house in Wolverhampton, Mrs Richards, 79, said: 'He rang me from a landline on my mobile phone just after 3 o'clock in the afternoon and just said to me 'mum, please don't worry but I'm in a police station.' 'He said ""I've been set up. I've been arrested on suspicion of absconding from prison"". He didn't say which police station he was in but told me not to worry. 'I was so shocked I broke down in tears at the kitchen table and it took me an hour to tell my husband what had happened. As far as we were concerned, and David was concerned for that matter, he was a free man. 'He never hid from anyone and was even claiming disability benefits. He's got one leg longer than the other and walks with a crutch and a walking stick. 'He can't work but he's so helpful to everyone and he's just a lovely, kind man. Its ridiculous that he has been arrested after so much time. 'He walked out of the open prison because he couldn't handle the stress and bullying he was going through. 'He only had a few months left to serve and we just thought he was free because no one came for him from the police. He gave our address for his mail and rented a flat nearby from a well to do couple. 'He never told them about his past because that's where it was, in the past and he was making a new life for himself. 'I don't think David even knew he was in trouble because he's been claiming benefits and even called the police when he thought someone was throwing stones at his windows. 'He's had a passport for heavens sake and travelled to Ireland so he's not exactly been lying low. 'The police and the authorities have had plenty of chances to catch up with him and it seems very unfair to do so now when he's been leading a law-abiding life for nine years. 'The people around here don't know about what happened (David's crimes) and I don't know how I will face them if people find out. 'David couldn't work. He was disabled and claimed benefits and his benefits paid his rent for him.'","Hunt should have been triggered in 2005 after David Richards absconded .

"The Champions League, it most certainly ain’t. While those further up the food chain console themselves with the knowledge that they’re doing The Right Thing for a club that will be here long after Ronny Deila has departed, the manager is the guy left to deal with the realities on the ground. From the eloquent Norwegian, there is no pretence that the Europa League group into which Celtic were pitched on Friday can possibly compare to what might have been. No disrespect to the good people of Salzburg, Zagreb and Giurgiu, but it hardly compares with taking on the very best from the Premier League and Bundesliga. Instead of trying to blow smoke, Deila simply accepts UEFA’s second-tier club competition for what it is. Just as he accepts the responsibility for his team’ s play-off failure against NK Maribor. Scroll down for video... My bad! Ronny Deila (R) accepts responsibility for Celtic's exit from the Champions League . ‘Of course I am responsible for things here,’ he said, when asked if it was fair for fans to start judging him so soon into his time as manager. ‘It is better to take it out on me than on the rest. But I hope now I am going to show that we are going to progress as a team. We have also had some good games so far, it’s not only been bad, but of course the Champions League has been a big influence here. ‘I saw a lot of emotions through that and, now we have done that, we have to look forward to what we’re going to do in the league and building that style of play and the team we want. ‘The supporters and everyone wants to go into the Champions League. That’s the main thing. If you lose it, the emotions come, you get very sad of course and it’s not easy to see the big picture.’ Home disadvantage: The Celtic manager looks on as Maribor celebrate their 1-0 victory at Celtic Park . Talk of big pictures and grand projects usually meets with short shrift and some fairly unprepossessing criticism from fans who view promises of jam tomorrow with a fair degree of suspicion. Talking about the reaction since Tuesday night’s loss, Deila said: ‘Of course it is hard. It’s hard losing. But you have to look at the longer prospects and work on what you believe in - and build the team how you want it. ‘That has also been harder with the pressure on the Champions League all the time. Now that chapter is gone we can control the situation and the next chapter is to build the team and to get ready for next year. ‘We have to do good performances this year so we achieve the things we want to do. That’s a big task but that’s why I came here. ‘It’s very different when you see that three matches into the league, your season is over – that’s if I listen to some people! ‘We’ve got a lot of matches left in the league and a lot of matches in Europe and the cups, hopefully.’ Super strike: Maribor's Tavares scored in the second leg to give Maribor a 2-1 aggregate victory . Deila is adamant that he doesn’t regret a single thing – including leaving last year’s multiple Player of the Year, Kris Commons, on the bench – for the dispiriting 1-0 home loss to a team, Maribor, who had appeared there for the taking in last week’s 1-1 away draw. ‘I don’t have any regrets from Tuesday,’ he said. ‘We went into the game with a match plan but the first half was too passive. We should have gone harder on them. ‘But we didn’t want to sit back, we changed after the break and the first 20 minutes of the second half was much more aggressive. We created chances. ‘Look at the two matches, they were quite equal. It went against us. That is also about skills – but I think we improved from the Legia game. ‘You never know what would have happened if you did something differently. But we were well prepared, had a match plan – and knew what we were going to do if things weren’t going well. We made changes that made the team better, we just didn’t get a final result. ‘You can always think about what might have been. But we weren’t good enough, so we take the draw we’ve got – and look forward to competing in the Europa League. What could have been? Ronny Deila has no regrets, including leaving Kris Commons out of the starting XI . ‘Our aim is to get experience, of course, and to try to get through to the next stage. That’s something the club has done before but it’s a big challenge for us. ‘This is a new chapter. We have to prepare the team to do several things – win the league and win trophies, but also make the team ready for the Champions League next year, if we win the league. ‘That will make the experience will get now invaluable. It’s very hard for me to say whether we should get out of this group. We have a good chance to make some good results there. ‘These are still international games against good teams. Of course we wanted to be in the Champions League. But this is a good opportunity for us. ‘Yes, we can make an impact in the Europa League. Things are happening very quickly here. We’re getting better – and we will get better all the time. ‘We’ve had a lot of players out, we’ve got new players coming in that we haven’ t used yet. So the team will of course get better and better. ‘But it takes time to get players into the team, get injured players fit. Let’s see where we are in December.’ Step down: Celtic players react in the knowledge they will be playing in Europe's second tier competition . In December, they’ll be in Zagreb, taking on Dynamo in their final Group D fixture. It’s not Stamford Bridge, nor is it Schalke’s Veltins Arena – or Sporting Lisbon’s Estadion Jose Alvalade.

"Created: . 09:17 EST, 8 August 2014 . A mother-of-two was left horrified after she found what she claims is a 'wriggling worm’ in a burger as she sat down for a family BBQ. Anna Seth-Smith, 44, was preparing for dinner during a holiday in Helston, Cornwall, when she cut into the quarter pounder - and the suspected parasite fell out. The primary school purchased the burger from a Sainsbury's near the Skyburriowe Farm campsite - but the supermarket giants insist the object is not a tapeworm and has sent the creature for tests. Wriggling: . The mother was handing the burger to her daughter at the Skyburriowe . Farm campsite when she noticed the 'worm' - and immediately contacted . Cornwall Council's Environmental Health Department . Disgusted: Anna Seth-Smith, 44, was enjoying a BBQ with her daughter Elena, seven (left), partner Jon Heath (right) and 15-month-old son Atticus (front) in Helston, Cornwall, when the suspected parasite fell out . Mrs Seth-Smith made the shocking discovery as she was handing the food to her seven-year-old daughter Elena. Mrs Seth-Smith reported the case to the department of Environmental Health at Cornwall Council the following morning who collected the burger and have now taken it for analysis. Sainsbury’s have apologised to the family but insist the 'object' was not a tapeworm. Mrs Seth-Smith - who was with her partner Jon Heath, Elena and her son Atticus, 15 months, at the time - said: 'I had prepared a really lovely green salad and we were just getting ready to eat. 'We got one of the burgers off the BBQ and put one on a plate to check it was cooked and before we knew it something appeared out of the meat. 'We just starred at it in shock. It just wriggled and wriggled and then died. We are just horrified. I was going to give it to my daughter, imagine that. It makes me feel sick just thinking about it.' Shocked: Mrs Seth-Smith, from London, quickly threw the other three burgers away in disgust . The shocked couple quickly threw the other three burgers away. Anna added: 'I just feel appalled - what if the whole batch is contaminated and people have already bought them and haven’t eaten them and they are just sitting in their fridge? 'It definitely put us off our food and I have gone off burgers completely. I guess it is one of those urban legends. People talk about it happening, but as you don’t know of anyone who it is happened to you just assume it isn’t really a problem. 'I never would have imagined it would happen to us.' Sainsbury’s said: ‘As the Environmental Health Officer has confirmed, this was not a worm of any kind but a small part of the meat used to make the burgers. Any suggestion that there was a worm in this product is false. 'We’d like to apologise to Mrs Seth-Smith for her experience.' Anna said she will report the incident to supermarket once she has been given the results from Environmental Health. Response: Sainbury's have apologised to the family, but insist the 'object' is not a tapeworm .","Anna Seth-Smith was in Helston, Cornwall, with her two children and partner .

"Dozens of French gipsies have set up camp at an iconic pottery factory in an attempt to snap up prestigious Royal Albert tableware for their caravans. Up to 40 travellers  descended on the car park of British ceramics designer Emma Bridgewater’s factory in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, earlier this week. However, despite hoping to pick up Royal Albert plates and saucers from the factory, the travellers have been left disappointed after being told the premises doesn't stock the sought-after collectables. Up to 40 gipsies have set up camp at the back of Emma Bridgewater’s factory in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire . The gipsies said they had travelled from France to Stoke-on-Trent to stock up on Royal Albert tableware . The gipsies said they had travelled all the way from Europe just to buy the tableware – which is more commonly associated with the Queen and Royal households across the world. However, they were surprised to learn that they had set up camp outside the wrong factory – as it was the Wedgwood factory on the opposite side of the city which was once home to Royal Albert tableware. Matthew Rice, the boss of the Emma Bridgewater factory which stocks the famous ceramics designer’s works, told the gipsies the pottery was no longer made in Britain. He said: ‘They were all French and arrived here on Sunday night. ‘I had a conversation with them and they asked where they could buy Royal Albert tableware and I told them to go to the Wedgwood factory shop in Etruria in Staffordshire. ‘Traditional English gipsies have been known to collect Royal Crown Derby but these wanted Royal Albert. They have great taste. The group, who brought about 12 caravans with them, were disappointed to learn they couldn't buy Royal Albert china at British ceramics designer Emma Bridgewater’s factory . The travellers have left factory workers needing to find alternative places to park when they arrive at work . ‘I told them that it should be made in Stoke-on-Trent but unfortunately it is now made abroad and they tutted.’ The arrival of the 12 caravans has left factory workers needing to find alternative places to park when they turn up to work. Mr Rice added: ‘The only disadvantage is that they do take up a lot of the car park which could become awkward for our customers, especially when we get quite a lot of visitors. ‘It could affect our business if people can’t park but they did say they wouldn’t be staying long. ‘We have had trouble in the past with things going missing but that happens even when we don’t have gipsies nearby so I am not overly concerned.’ The car park is owned by Stoke-on-Trent City Council but is leased to the pottery factory which means the owners must take action to remove them and clean the site. Residents living near the site said they wanted to see the back of the French travellers as soon as possible. It is understood the travellers mistakenly set up camp outside Emma Bridgewater's factory (above) instead of the nearby Wedgwood Factory Store which once was home to the prestigious Royal Albert tableware . Emma Bridgewater (above)  is a  British ceramics designer who makes all of her pottery in Stoke-on-Trent . The travellers were hoping to snap up some of the Royal Albert tableware collection (above, file picture) Josh Laenen, 31, said: ‘I noticed the car park was full of caravans on Monday morning and I was shocked. ‘I will be increasing security. I wouldn’t like them to stay for long.’ And Jane Thompson, 45, added: ‘I hope they don’t stay for long now they know the stuff they want isn’t made here. ‘It is nice that they came and wanted to buy our famous pottery but sadly they will have to travel elsewhere to try and get what they are after.’ Experts believe the gipsies want the Royal Albert ware to decorate their caravans. Travellers’ Times editor Damian Le Bas said: ‘Traditionally china was one of the main means of investment. ‘It goes back to the days when most gipsies didn’t have bank accounts, so they would invest in gold jewellery and china, but nowadays it plays more of a decorative role. ‘Royal Crown Derby is very popular. It is refreshing to hear that the owner of the business spoke to them and is being patient. The travellers are said to be moving on from the area in due course after being unable to buy the Royal china . Residents living near the site said they want the gipsies to move away from the area sooner rather than later . ‘There are many families who take pride in not leaving a mess and there is nothing more depressing than knowing you will be tarred with that brush when others do it.’ The Royal Albert brand was created 110 years ago in 1904 and the prestigious ware was first made at a factory in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent. Its roots are found in the Albert Works in the Staffordshire city which were bought by Thomas Wild Senior and his son in 1896. A year later the company produced a range of Commemorative Pieces for Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee - leading to the presentation of a Royal Warrant. They then built up a reputation of producing beautiful china tea and breakfast sets and firmly established the Royal Albert brand. Their English bone china is widely admired for its lightness, translucency and its soft subtle almost pearly white quality. Earlier this year, model Miranda Kerr announced a partnership with the Royal china brand and the 31-year-old recently unveiled a four-piece set in Australia which she designed herself.","Up to 40 gipsies travelled from France to Stoke-on-Trent for the Royal china .

"Harry Redknapp has told Adel Taarabt to reduce weight and get fit if he wants to become a Barclays Premier League star. The forward missed pre-season training, struggling with ankle-ligament damage after returning from a loan spell at AC Milan. Taarabt has started only once, in the League Cup against Burton, and came on in the last minute in the league against Sunderland. Adel Taarabt shakes hands with Harry Redknapp during pre-season training with QPR . But the Moroccan turned his ankle again in training this week and Redknapp is growing frustrated that the player’s weight is ballooning when he is out injured. Redknapp said: ‘He’s twisted his ankle, it’s sore again, so we’re back to square one with him. We just can’t get him fit. ‘It’s difficult, he keeps trying to come back and it goes again. Do you rest him for a few weeks? But then while he’s resting, is he going to put on weight? How’re you going to get him fit? It’s such a difficult job with him. ‘He missed the pre-season, that’s the problem. It’s frustrating because he’s a talent, I’d like to have him available against Stoke. He’s got great ability.’ Taarabt playing for QPR against Burton Albion in the Capital One Cup . Taarabt has already had one scan on the ankle and will soon have another if there is no improvement. He was loaned out for all of last season – spending half the campaign at Fulham and the other in Italy with Milan – after being deemed not suited to help QPR’s fight for promotion. But Redknapp believes he is focused on the club again. He added: ‘He probably thought he was going back to AC Milan, but he’s here and he wants to play. He loves football. We’ve got to get him fit and he’s got to get himself fit. If he does that he could be a big asset to us this year. We all want him fit.’ Redknapp with his staff and players during the annual photocall at the club .","Harry Redknapp has told Adel Taarabt to reduce weight and get fit .

"A judge has granted a protection order against Nebraska Lieutenant Governor Lavon Heidemann after his sister accused him of violent behavior. The order, which was issued Monday against Lt. Gov. Heidemann, a farmer from Elk Creek, Nebraska, comes as he looks to return to office as the running mate of Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Ricketts. His sister, Lois Bohling, of Tecumseh, Nebraska, claims that her brother came after her like a 'wild man,' charging at her and grabbing her wrists after a disagreement over some property left by their late father and the care of their mother. No contact: Nebraska Lt. Gov. Lavon Heidemann was accused of violent behavior by his sister, Lois Bohling . Lt. Gov. Heidemann refuted these claims, saying in a statement, 'This is a private, legal family matter regarding disagreements resulting from my dad’s estate, as well as the best possible medical treatment for my mom. I dispute much of my sister’s claims.' He then added, 'My immediate family has great support from the rest of our family, our church and our friends – we appreciate that support so very much in this difficult time, as we work toward a full resolution.' Miss Bohling filed a sworn statement last month in which she detailed some of her brothers behavior, going back to December of 2013. She wanted to block Lt. Gov. Heidemann from contacting her or from visiting their disabled mother, Lola Heidemann, who was widowed after their father died in January of 2013. Of that December encounter, she said that during a family discussion her brother 'was shouting at me and at one point raised up, and started to come over the table at me with a furor in his eyes, like a wild man, that scared me to pieces.' This is the same look she said she saw the last time they were together, at their mother's home, with the Lt. Gov. allegedly upset over how Miss Bohling was caring for the elderly woman. 'He had charged at me and instinctively, without realizing it, my hands were in front of my head trying to protect his charging at me. That same look of hatred that I saw last December was in his eyes,' she said in her statement. 'He grabbed my arms still in front of my face. He was screaming at me with his face no more than six inches from my face. He was forcefully holding on to both of my arms at the wrist area and screamed, ""YOU ARE TO STAY AWAY FROM HERE."" I heard mom while crying, saying, (several times) ""No, Lavon, don't.""' A spokesperson for Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman issued a statement that said, 'The Governor is aware of the situation, and he is currently gathering and reviewing the facts. He is not going to rush to judgment on the Lt. Governor’s family situation. He recognizes this is a difficult and trying matter for the Lt. Governor and his family.' Heidemann was appointed lieutenant governor in February of 2013.","Lois Bohling claims her brother, Lt. Gov.

"Frances Andrade died a week after giving evidence at the trial of her former music teacher . A coroner has criticised mental health services for ‘failing’ to provide proper care to a concert violinist who died just a week after giving evidence against her predatory former choirmaster. Coroner Richard Travers also demanded that new rules are put in place to ensure that vulnerable witnesses are given better support when they face often traumatic trials. Mother-of-four Frances Andrade was ‘extremely traumatised’ after testifying about abuse she suffered as a teenager at the hands of ex-Chetham’s School of Music choirmaster Michael Brewer and his wife Kay. She took a fatal overdose at her home in Guildford, Surrey, days later on January 24, 2013. She did not live to see her abuser jailed for six years for five counts of indecent assault two months later. Delivering his verdict at Woking Coroner’s Court, Mr Travers said he could not be sure she intended to kill herself and ruled out a verdict of suicide. Brewer preyed on the young violin virtuoso at the prestigious school in Manchester, forcing her to perform sex acts on him in his office and camper van. His ex-wife later joined in the abuse and was jailed for 21 months for one count of indecent assault. Mrs Andrade had confided in her husband Levine, 59, but chose not to tell police. In 2011 she told a friend, who later contacted officers. As police investigated the case, she became increasingly down, withdrawn and depressed and repeatedly took overdoses, the inquest heard. But despite this, failures among health professionals meant she was accidentally ‘amber-zoned’ in records kept by a mental health team, whereas she had been assessed as the top ‘red’ priority. As 2012 drew to a close and the date of her abuser's trial got nearer, her mental health deteriorated and she ‘changed significantly’. Scroll down for video . Michael Brewer and his ex-wife Kay were sentenced for the sexual abuse of Mrs Andrade in 2013 . Mr Travers said Mrs Andrade told doctors ‘the overdoses had been triggered by anxiety that came from the court case. ‘Her reason to overdose was not to kill herself but was a way to cope with the court case.’ But the coroner hit out at the support received by the talented musician. He said health professionals repeatedly failed to appreciate the risk she posed to herself. He said: ‘I can't help but think there was a real failure to appreciate the urgency of the situation and a failure to act upon it in an appropriate manner. ‘What is clear is she found giving evidence extremely traumatic.’ She had to endure a tense cross-examination by defence lawyers during her abuser's court case in January last year. And during the trial, on January 23, the judge in Brewer's case ordered the jury to deliver a number of not-guilty verdicts because of principles of law. Her husband Levine Andrade (pictured) said he hoped his wife's death would ensure that other victims do not have to go through the same ordeal . At 8am the next day Mr Andrade found his wife, known as Fran, dead at their home. He earlier told the inquest she had sunk into ‘incredible despair’ and ‘felt the defence barrister seemed to be attacking her personally’. The coroner said a failure to explain to the Mrs Andrade why the not-guilty verdicts had been ordered was wrong. He said: ‘Such matters, if left unexplained, could have a devastating effect on a complainant, who might well take it to be a reflection of the evidence that they have given.’ Mr Travers said failures in Mrs Andrade's medical care at the end of 2012 meant she was not allocated a care co-ordinator quickly enough, and when she eventually was he was off sick. He also said there were serious shortcomings in communication between her mental health worker and GP. He said the lack of urgency surrounding her care was ‘quite extraordinary’. ‘There was a real failure to provide Fran with the care that some two months before it was recognised that she needed,’ he said. The coroner said he would write to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to call for alleged victims in trials to be given an explanation when jurors are ordered to give not-guilty verdicts. He also wants the DPP to ensure that advice about the psychiatric counselling available to vulnerable victims is clarified. And he will write a third report to Surrey and Borders NHS Trust, calling for greater safeguards to ensure that prescribed medication belonging to family members of people who have overdosed on it is better protected. Speaking after the inquest, Mr Andrade said he hoped his wife's tragic death would ensure that other victims do not have to go through the same ordeal she did. He said: ‘I think that all the services involved really looked at what went wrong and they have all tightened up their measures. And hopefully for the next lot of victims something will have changed for the better.’ Asked if he wished his wife had never had to go to court, he said: ‘I can't say that because, for one reason, she needed to for her own peace of mind.’ He said maybe his wife ‘could have got more care’ adding: ‘I think that was shown today in the inquiries of the coroner's final decision.’ The inquest was held at Wokingham Borough Council (pictured) where Coroner Richard Travers criticised mental health services and demanded that new rules are put in place . The verdict follows a damning serious case review by Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board in April which found Mrs Andrade's death ‘could and should’ have been prevented. It concluded she was let down by mental health services who failed to recognise she was vulnerable as she made repeated suicide bids and faced her abuser in court. Brewer, who went on to direct the World Youth Choir, was stripped of his OBE for services to music after being jailed for the assaults when Mrs Andrade was aged just 14 and 15. Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive at Victim Support, called for an urgent inquiry into how the criminal justice system treats victims of crime who have mental health issues. He said: 'It is appalling that Frances Andrade did not get the help she needed to cope with the trauma of the sexual abuse she suffered as a teenager. 'It's critical that vulnerable victims and witnesses get the right support and information about the progress of their cases. Without this we fear more cases will end in tragedy. 'We believe there is an urgent need for an inquiry into how the criminal justice system treats victims of crime who have mental health issues, matching recent efforts to help the people who commit those crimes who have mental health needs.'","Frances Andrade was 'extremely traumatised' after testifying about abuse .

"Brad Pitt's stunning choice of engagement ring appears to perfectly reflect his feelings for the beautiful actress. In the first close-up look at the flawless diamond ring, the love and care that went into the design - which Pitt - alongside jeweller Robert Procop - took a year to perfect -  is evident. The large square diamond wouldn't have looked out of place in Elizabeth Taylor's stunning collection of jewels. The oblong-shaped rock is inset into a thick ribbed band. Rock of commitment: Angelina Jolie sports the $250,000 engagement ring designed by partner Brad Pitt and jeweller Robert Procop which took 12 months . The 36-year-old actress was spotted wearing the ring on her wedding finger at the Chinese Art collection at the LA County . Museum earlier this month, where she was pictured with Brad, 48, and their son Pax, eight. Pitt designed the ring for the mother of his six children in collaboration with jeweller Robert Procop who broke the news of the engagement in a statement last Friday. He said: 'Brad had a specific vision for this ring, which he realised over a year-long collaboration with Robert,' Procop’s team said in a statement. 'He wanted every aspect of it to be perfect.' The Hollywood power couple confirmed their engagement last week in a statement - and their six children were said to be especially happy about the news. Their spokeswoman said: 'It is a promise for the future and their . kids are very happy. There's no date set at this time.' It's official: Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt,  seen here last Wednesday at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, have confirmed they are engaged . Procop . said: 'Brad had a specific vision for this ring, which he realised over . a yearlong collaboration. He wanted every aspect of  it to be perfect, . so I was able to locate a diamond of the finest quality and cut it to an . exact custom size and shape to suite Angelina's hand. He continued: 'Brad was always . heavily involved, overseeing every aspect of the creative design . evolution. 'The side diamonds are specially cut to encircle her finger. Each diamond is of the highest gem quality.' Experts estimate the ring cost around $250,000. Angelina's . father Jon Voight was among the first to publicly congratulate the . pair, telling Us Weekly: 'I'm very happy for them.' Angelina has been married twice before - to . British actor Jonny Lee Miller between 1996 and 1999 and then Billy Bob Thornton, from 2000 to 2003. Happy family: 'Brangelina' have six children, three biological and three adopted, seen here in New Orleans in March last year. Their brood are delighted their parents are getting wed, according to a spokeswoman . Brad's marriage to Jennifer . Aniston . lasted five years before they announced they were divorcing in early . 2005 - which came after he had met Angelina on the set of Mr & Mrs . Smith. Brangelina . - as they became known - quickly became a Hollywood power couple, with a . brood of six children; five-year-old . Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne, aged three, along with three . adopted children Maddox, 10, Pax, eight, and Zahara, seven. The former Friends star is said to be delighted for the couple. The actress, 43, is so happy with her own beau Justin Theroux that she is actually pleased with the situation, according to reports. According to HollywoodLife.com a source said: 'Jennifer is happy for Brad and Angelina. She is so in love with Justin, that she is really grateful how things turned out. 'In a strange way if it weren’t for Angelina, Jennifer would not have connected with Justin in a romantic way. Jennifer is in a really wonderful place right now.' The wedding is on:  Angelina and Brad have not yet set a date for their wedding but they are building a chapel on their property in France . The couple once insisted they wouldn't wed until the legalisation of same-sex marriage in America. Chemistry: The pair met on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith, which was released in 2005 . But Brad recently admitted he didn't feel they'd be to wait that long because of mounting pressure from their children. 'It seems to mean more and more to our kids,' he said in January. 'We . made this declaration some time ago that we weren't going to [get . married] till everyone can. But I don't think we'll be able to hold out … . it means something to me, too, to make that kind of commitment.' She said just months ago: 'We've . explained to them that our commitment, when we decided to start a . family, was the greatest commitment you could possibly have. 'Once you have six children, you're committed.' Their high-profile romance has made headlines since sparks first flew on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith back in 2004. There was intense speculation they started up a relationship while Brad was still with his then-wife Jennifer Aniston. Brad . and Jen announced they were divorcing in early 2005 - but it wasn't . until early 2006 that Angelina and Brad acknowledged their relationship . when the actress revealed she was pregnant. In October 2008, Angelina told The New . York Times that her children loved Mr & Mrs Smith because: 'Not a . lot of people get to see a movie where their parents fell in love.' But she has explained: 'To be intimate with a . married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I . could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.'",Couple's private jeweller Robert Procop reveals actor commissioned diamond design .
"A drink-driver who crashed in a country lane phoned her passenger's father instead of 999, leaving the distraught man to find his dead son at the scene. Debbie Barker has been jailed for three years over the late-night crash which killed hotelier Tom Bannister as they drove home from his Coniston Hotel near Skipton, North Yorkshire. Police found Barker, 43, lying in a field in her nightdress four hours after she lost control of her Range Rover and hit a wall, a court heard. She was still over the drink-drive limit. Killed: Debbie Barker (left) has been jailed for three years after she crashed while over the drink drive limit in a country lane, killing Tom Bannister (right) as she gave him a lift home his hotel near Skipton, North Yorkshire . Event: The pair had left the Coniston Hotel near Skipton, North Yorkshire, which Mr Bannister's family owned . Bradford Crown Court heard Mr Bannister, 48, had accepted a lift with Barker after an event at the hotel his family owned on June 22 last year. As she wound through the Yorkshire Dales National Park near the village of Bell Busk, where he lived, the car rolled on a moderate bend and hit a wall, coming to rest in a field. Father-of-one Mr Bannister was thrown from the car while Barker survived, concussed and unable to remember the car leaving the road. She later told police that she did not have her phone, so she went to her friend's nearby home to raise help. Sentence: Barker arriving at Bradford Crown Court yesterday, where she was jailed for three years . Ian Howard, prosecuting, said she was unable to gain a response so she then walked across fields to reach her own house. But instead of phoning 999 she phoned Mr Bannister’s father, Michael, who went outside and found his son showing no signs of life. An ambulance finally arrived at 2.57am and the victim, who suffered severe head injuries, was pronounced dead at the scene. Half an hour later officers visited Barker's home, but saw she was not there and two mobile phones were on the kitchen table. After a short search, they found her in a field just yards from her home at 4.09am. Several breath tests revealed Barker was over the drink drive limit. Police estimated she was at around twice the legal limit at the time of the accident, believed to have been around midnight. Mr Howard said the call to Michael Bannister was 'probably made about two hours after the accident had taken place'. Barker pleaded guilty to two charges - causing death by careless driving while over the prescribed limit, and failing to report an accident. Prosecutors argued Barker knew she was over the legal limit and wanted to delay being tested. Malcolm Swift QC, defending, said the case was instead one of a 'ridiculous and stupid error'. He told the court: 'She was briefly concussed for a short period of time after the accident and had no recollection of the car leaving the road. 'She was lying down in the field about 20ft from the house (when she was found). She says she didn’t know how she came to be in the that position but she came round when she heard voices.' But Recorder of Bradford Judge Roger Thomas QC said Barker had done everything 'to keep herself out of the way and avoid detection'. He added: 'The only sensible reason is she was trying to lie low and avoid the situation'. The judge told her: 'You must have been significantly over the prescribed limit for driving. 'You failed to negotiate a fairly moderate bend in the road, going straight on a hitting a wall. It must have been apparent to you he was very badly injured.' The court heard the Barkers and the Bannisters were friends, and Mr Bannister’s family had supported Barker after the accident. Traffic Constable Andy Macleod, of North Yorkshire Police’s Roads Policing Group, said: 'Barker showed a callous disregard for Mr Bannister’s welfare when she left the scene of the collision. Isolated: Police said the crash was in a country lane (pictured) between the villages of Airton and Bell Busk . Businessman: Police said hotelier Mr Bannister was a popular member of the community and his family was on good terms with Barker's. His relatives remained supportive towards her after the accident, the court heard . 'The sentence reflects the gravity of the offences she committed and how seriously all agencies in the criminal justice system view them.' Gerry Wareham, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for Yorkshire and Humberside, added: 'By getting behind the wheel of her vehicle after she had been drinking she took a huge and irresponsible risk and, very sadly, Mr Bannister paid for it with his life. 'She then neglected to alert emergency services as soon as practicable and it was several hours after the accident before any potential help arrived. 'Thomas Bannister was very well-known and much-loved in the local community. He was a father, a son and a friend to many and will be sorely missed. 'This terrible case has resulted in the loss of his life and devastated that of many others. I hope it serves as a stark warning of the potentially tragic consequences of drinking and driving.' Barker, of Gargrave, North Yorkshire, was jailed for three years and banned from driving for five years.","Debbie Barker, 43, took Tom Bannister from Coniston Hotel, North Yorkshire .

"A former portfolio manager in Florida was convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison on Monday after helping his firm earn more than a quarter-billion dollars through an illegal insider trading scheme. Mathew Martoma, an ex-trader from Boca Raton, earned his firm SAC Capital Advisors more than $275million through an insider trading scheme where he cultivated a relationship with two doctors that later provided tips. U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe said the sheer amount of the record-setting fraud merited the long sentence. Scroll down for video . Going inside: Mathew Martoma, 40, a former portfolio manager for SAC Capital Advisors, was sentenced on Monday to 9 years for a record-breaking insider trading scheme . Martoma, 40, left federal court in Manhattan hand in hand with his wife. Gardephe ordered him to begin serving the sentence in November for his February conviction on charges of conspiracy and two counts of securities fraud. Martoma had flattered and enriched two doctors with inside information about the secret results of an Alzheimer's drug trial so they would tip him off and he could trade ahead of public announcements. The tips enabled SAC Capital Advisors, based in Stamford, Connecticut, to earn more than $275million illegally. The success caused the firm, headed by billionaire Steven A. Cohen, to reward him with more than $9million in bonuses. The judge ordered Martoma to forfeit $9.3million, including his home and banks accounts holding millions of dollars in the names of him and his wife. Family man: Martoma left the courthouse holding hands with his wife Rosemary. He has three children ages 9, 7 and 5 . Long trip: U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Martoma 'traded his liberty, his name and his time with his family for what in the end is nothing.' Martoma declined to comment before the sentence. As the judge announced the sentence, saying ""the sums here are staggering in size,"" Martoma stood and looked straight ahead, and his wife wiped her eyes with a tissue. The judge said the illegal edge Martoma obtained as he traded in the stocks was a crime that is ""deeply corrosive to our markets"" and caused people to be cynical about the financial industry. ""The gain here is hundreds of millions of dollars more than has ever been seen in an insider trading prosecution,"" the judge said. He rejected requests by Martoma's defense attorney, Richard Strassberg, that he receive a sentence of two to three years in prison because of his charitable work. He also rejected claims based on the need to take care of his wife and three children, ages 9, 7 and 5. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement that the ""long and short of Mathew Martoma's trading is that he traded his liberty, his name and his time with his family for what in the end is nothing."" Strassberg had insisted Martoma made a sensible decision to sell the bloated stocks of the pharmaceutical companies that sponsored the drug trial. At the trial, Sidney Gilman, a former professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School, testified he gave Martoma secret results of the drug trial sponsored by Elan Corporation and Wyeth nearly two weeks before they were publicly announced in the summer of 2008. Gilman, once one of the world's top Alzheimer's experts, said he was charmed by Martoma. He said he seemed more knowledgeable about his work than hundreds of other financial professionals who paid Gilman more than $1million over several years for consultations. SAC Capital pleaded guilty in November to fraud charges and agreed to pay $1.8billion to settle charges that it allowed, if not encouraged, insider trading for more than a decade. Cohen has disputed the allegations involving his company.","Mathew Martoma, 40, earned his firm, SAC Capital Advisors, more than $275million through insider trading .

"With new phones being released almost monthly, signing up to a 24-month contract for one particular handset can be a gamble, and getting out of contracts can work out more expensive than buying a brand new handset out right. To tackle this problem, network operator EE has launched its Swap scheme that lets customers upgrade to a new device just six months into an 18-month or two-year contract, and pay just a one-off fee. Swap is available to customers already on 4GEE, Orange and T-Mobile plans and after six months they can return their device and get an upgrade to a brand new phone on a 24-month contract on 4GEE. Britain's first 4G network, run by EE, launches today -but has come under fire for its high prices . Then, if within the next six months a better phone comes out, they can swap again. The amount a customer pays as a one-off fee depends on which contract they are on. For example, people who currently have a £51 per month 4GEE contract will pay just £49 to break the contract and upgrade to a new phone and plan. If the same customer, on a 24-month plan, had to pay off the rest of their contract after six months they would pay £918. The most expensive example given by EE was for customers on a £36 per month 4GEE. To upgrade through the Swap scheme they would have to pay £249, compared to buying out their contract for £648. EE's Swap scheme applies to existing 4GEE, Orange and T-Mobile customers. Plans can be upgraded after six months for a one-off fee. If within the next six months a better phone comes out, they can swap again. The amount a customer pays as a one-off fee depends on which contract they are on. On Phones4U Jump, the customer pays one monthly amount for the handset and services, called the Jump payment, and a separate monthly amount for the 'network airtime agreement'. The Jump agreement can be upgraded after six months. The amount a customer will pay to Jump varies by handset and contract. O2's Refresh service lets existing customers upgrade their handsets before the end of their contract. Refresh contracts are split in two and customers pay a phone plan and a network plan. Customers can upgrade at any time. Then when it comes to upgrading, O2 lets customers pay off just their phone plan, and not their airtime plan. According to the terms and conditions, customers must already have a device on an eligible plan. The phone must also be 'in good working order, with no significant dents, scratches, or cracks on the screen.' EE's Swap scheme is similar to Phones4U's Jump tariff that splits contract agreements into two. The customer pays one monthly amount for the handset and services, called the Jump payment, and then a separate monthly amount for the 'network airtime agreement'. With Apple poised to launch a new handset, customers with the iPhone 5, pictured, could upgrade after just six months with EE Swap . They can then upgrade their Jump agreement after six months, while the network agreement stays the same. The amount a customer will pay to Jump varies by handset and contract. Network provider O2's Refresh service also lets customers upgrade their handsets before the end of their contract and similarly splits the agreement into two. However, on O2 Refresh customers can upgrade at any point. When the time comes to upgrade, O2 lets customers then pay off just their phone plan, and not their airtime plan. For example, after five months of a two-year, £32-a-month O2 Refresh contract the customer pays £285 to upgrade, rather than £608 with other operators. Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, told MailOnline: 'Being able to move into the mobile fast lane for a one-off fee could be the offer many consumers need to make the switch. 'Buying your way out of a contract has never been easy or cheap, but this scheme keeps things straightforward. 'However, tying the one-off fee into the tariff type could prove to be a blessing and a curse. 'Customers looking to move just six months into a 24-month contract will be the winners, whereas those in sight of the finish line may feel hard done by. 'But it’s hard to keep everyone happy, and what EE has done is simplify the process and 'swap' could give those EE customers with a phone in good condition the chance to enjoy 4G without the hefty outlay they may have feared.'","EE Swap lets contract customers upgrade their phones for a one-off fee .

"A town mayor who claimed he could barely walk to claim benefits has been spared jail. Brian Griffin, 76, was caught on film conning taxpayers out of £13,000 when he was filmed by fraud surveillance teams marching more than a mile on a Remembrance Day parade. The pensioner had previously denied one count of failing to properly notify the Department of Work and Pensions of a change in circumstances. He was found guilty on July 21 after a two-day trial. Scroll down for video . Griffin, 76, was caught on film conning taxpayers out of £13,000 when he was videoed by fraud surveillance teams marching more than a mile on Remembrance Day Parade (pictured left). A court also heard he was fit enough to carry out 130 duties while he was the mayor of Eastwood, in Nottinghamshire (right) And today, District Judge Morris Cooper gave him an eight-week jail term, suspended for six months at Nottingham Magistrates' Court. He was also ordered to pay £300 costs. He said Griffin was only saved from time in prison because of his previous good character, age and medical problems. He added that Griffin - who is still an Eastwood Town councillor - had presented him with a 'paradox' because he had carried out charitable and voluntary work and had never been in trouble before. Griffin, who was injured in a fall in 1997, first claimed the highest level of disability living allowance in 2003 after suffering from Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. But the pensioner failed to tell the Department of Works and Pensions (DWP) his health had improved, merely stating on claim forms in 2010 and 2012 that the condition 'varies'. A court heard that between June 3, 2009 and January 29, 2013 he received £13,448.95 in disability living allowance after claiming he could not walk more than 10 metres. Griffin was caught out when he was filmed by undercover investigators marching more than a mile to lay a wreath at a war memorial on Armistice Day in 2012 . Wayne Wallis, prosecuting, told the hearing that Griffin said his walking was 'limited to 10 metres, his balance and confidence outdoors were a constant problem, and he had to use crutches and a walking stick.' He was caught out when he was filmed by undercover investigators marching to lay a wreath at a war memorial on Armistice Day in 2012 while he was the mayor of Eastwood, in Nottinghamshire. A court heard that Griffin was fit enough to carry out 130 duties in just one year as mayor. He was also spotted standing for two hours selling poppies at Ikea, helping a friend fix a roof and working on his allotment. Griffin had a season ticket at Nottingham Forest FC in the higher part of a stands' upper tier and was an active member of a bowls club in the town. Mr Wallis said Griffin's cover was blown when an outraged member of the public anonymously tipped off the DWP. A fraud investigation team carried out undercover surveillance between September and November 2012 and caught Griffin on video performing tasks he had stated on his claim form he was unable to do. Mr Wallis said: 'He was seen to walk over 1,800 metres on the Remembrance Day parade while carrying a wreath, and remained on his feet the whole time.' Griffin claimed the DWP investigators caught him on a 'good day' when they filmed him at the procession . Griffin, who was mayor of Eastwood twice, in 2010-11 and 2012-13, had claimed DWP investigators caught him 'on a good day' when they filmed him at the procession. Giving evidence during his trial, he said: 'I was an active member of the community, my injury stopped that. It was a fall down some small steps and I thought I was OK. 'I try to walk because the doctors told me if I don't I will lose my leg, but I suffer later for it. 'Remembrance was one of my good days. I made the effort to go and suffered for it later. I have been forced to miss it in the past.' But he was found guilty by the fraud surveillance teams, after they looked through almost two hours of the undercover recordings. His benefits were taken away from him when he was reassessed by a doctor last year and he is now repaying the cash. Griffin (pictured right) was the Mayor of Eastwood, in Nottinghamshire, in 2010-11 and 2012-13 . Jessica Vogel, defending, said: 'He accepts he had carried out all these activities but did say the pain never goes away. 'He did say he feels ashamed at being 77 and having his first conviction. 'He made the initial claim on the basis he couldn't walk more than 10 metres. 'When he filled in the form in 2010 and 2012 he did change the description to 'varies'. He thought that would be sufficient notification but at trial it was found he should have made it more clear. 'He no longer claims any benefits and as a result of all this he is never likely to again. 'It is unlikely he will ever be before the court again. 'He has been paying back the money for some time.' Speaking after the case, DWP fraud manager Paul Baggaley said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system. 'Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of.'","Brian Griffin was given an eight-week jail term suspended for six months .

"A Florida couple who hoped to spend a day at sea in their new boat have been rescued after a broken engine and low winds forced them to spend a week stranded off the coast. Bogdan Makowski, 69, and his wife Elizabeth Makowski, 61, went sailing near Anclote Key, Florida last weekend in their newly purchased 1976 Almond Hunter boat, but after setting off, the engine cut out. At first, this didn't bother them. 'The engine stopped me after four hours. I don't care about this because I am sailing,' Mr Makowski told WTSP. Scroll down for video . Saved! Bogdan and Elizabeth Makowski are pictured during their early-morning rescue on Saturday after they spent nearly a week at sea.

Thankfully they had told a friend they were heading to sea and they alerted the Coast Guard when the couple failed to return . But then the wind gave up on them too. 'I put the sail and I go,' he recounted. 'Another problem: no wind. I wait 24 hours for the wind and nothing.' The couple called the boat's previous owner, who told them to contact BoatUS to get a tow. But the couple's phone's battery died and BoatUS never received a call. They had no food on board the 27-foot boat and ran out of water on the first day. Mr Makowski admitted that they even saved urine, but didn't have to resort to drinking it thanks to his wife finding a gallon of water in an old bucket. Their sail was also ripped but, using the small piece remaining, the couple managed to sail from 80 miles away to 10 miles within the shore. Stranded: The sail on the couple's 27-foot boat was also ripped, but they managed to sail towards the shore . Thankfully, they had told a friend that they were setting sail and to expect them back by Tuesday. When she still had not heard from them by Friday, she reported them missing to the Coast Guard Station Sand Key. The Coast Guard found the couple in good condition at 2am ,10 miles northwest of Anclote Key. 'We saw the blue lights from their ship and noticed that they were moving towards us,' Mr Makowski told WFLA. 'I probably lost a few pounds, my wife had some bruises but we are okay overall.' Their vessel was towed and the boaters were transferred safely to Anclote River Boat Ramp in Holiday, which is about 30 miles north of Tampa.

"Sally Farmiloe has died aged 60 after a long battle with cancer, her agent has confirmed . Former politician Jeffrey Archer has led the tributes to his former mistress Sally Farmiloe after she lost her long battle with cancer. The 66-year-old actress died peacefully in her sleep on Monday afternoon, surrounded by her family. After the news was announced, Jeffrey Archer led the tributes to his former mistress, saying he was 'saddened' by her death. The pair met through the Tory party, for which Farmiloe was a staunch fundraiser, and had an affair for three years until they were exposed in 1999. Archer told Telegraph diarist Tim Walker, who put the comment on Twitter: 'After Sally’s brave struggle against this terrible . disease, I was saddened to hear the news of her death'. The former Howards' Way actress had previously fought a long battle with breast cancer but was told in July last year that it had spread to her liver and bones. Announcing her death, her family paid tribute to the actress saying she had fought cancer with 'extraordinary courage' and was a 'warm and caring woman'. Her agent confirmed that Farmiloe had taken 'a turn for the worse' about one month ago and had been bed-bound for many weeks. She told MailOnline: 'Sally just faded away. She was very weak and she just went to sleep. She was not in pain and she just slipped away.' Last year, Farmiloe, who lived in Baron's Court, west London, was diagnosed with incurable bone and liver cancer. The news came just four months after she had finished her course of treatment for breast cancer.

"Authorities in Austria are poised to greenlight a plan to turn the former pub where Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was born into a 'House of Responsibility' museum to his crimes. The former pub Gasthaus zur Pommer, on Salzburger Vorstadt street, in Braunau-Am-Inn, has been empty for three years. On Friday a meeting was held in the town to discuss the private venture to strip it of its allure for the far-right. Over the years since the end of the war the building, where Hitler was born on April 20, 1889, has served as a bank, workshop, library, school and as a home for the disabled. Authorities in Austria are poised to greenlight a plan to turn the house where Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was born into a 'House of Responsibility' museum to his crimes . A stone stands outside the house in which  Hitler was born, with the inscription 'For peace, freedom and democracy, never again fascism, millions of dead are a warning' Since 2011 Braunau has paid the owners, who have had the property since 1912, £3,250-a-month to keep it empty as plans were discussed about what to do with it. Neo Nazis from across Europe continue to flock to it, paying homage to their evil messiah who moved out of the premises with father Alois and mother Klara shortly after birth. Now the Austrian interior ministry in Vienna has got behind the project of historian Andreas Maislinger to renovate the former pub into a 'House of Responsibility.' Oscar winning Jewish-born producer Branko Lustig is a heavyweight name backing the Maislinger scheme and has pledged big money from movie industry players in Hollywood for the museum plan. Other mooted projects, such as demolition or turning it into luxury flats, failed to gain traction. BILD newspaper in Germany commented: 'This combines to make it increasingly difficult for opponents to raise further objections against the idea of a museum.' . Maislinger was always against the idea of turning the house into apartments and said: 'The desire not to want to have anything to do with Hitler is fully understandable. But it wouldn't work, turning it in to a property. What would happen if a child lives in the house and his right-wing parents decide to call him Adolf?' Hitler (pictured, left, in 1934 and, right, in 1935) was born at the house on April 20, 1889. Over the years since the end of the war the building has served as a bank, workshop, library, school and as a home for the disabled . Supporters of the remembrance project hope that it will slowly strip the house of its appeal for extremists who come every year on Hitler's birthday to worship outside. This year a remembrance stone quarried from the site of the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria, where thousands were killed, was defaced with paint. Maislinger added: 'The house will only lose its appeal for such people when it stands as a clear and just symbol against Nazism.' Mayor Johanne Waidbacher said: 'It is a difficult subject. But the idea in principle of a House of Responsibility is, in itself, not a bad one.' After the 1938 Anschluss, when Hitler absorbed Austria into Greater Germany, the house was bought by Martin Bormann and became a Nazi 'cultural centre.' Anyone who wished to progress through party ranks was obliged to pay at least one visit there to pay homage to the leader. Before the end of WW2 fanatical Nazis tried and failed to demolish the building but it fell into American hands. Gerlinde Pommer's family bought the house in 1912 and, in a deal which gives her £4,000-a-month rent, she leases it back to Braunau. That way the city fathers made sure no questionable - ie Nazi - groups got their hands on it. The only Nazi-era relic is on an iron gate outside, the initials MB for Hitler's party secretary Martin Bormann. Juergen Schmidt, a local, said: 'It is about time we got rid of this eyesore and this shame. Making it into a place of memory for the victims of Nazism is a good idea.' A decision on what to do with it is expected within weeks.","The former pub in Branau-Am-Inn has been empty for the last three years .

"They say that diamonds are a girl's best friend. And some lucky girls will never be short of friends thanks to another sparkling find by British miners Gem Diamonds Limited. Supplying to prestigious clients such as Harry Winston - Marilyn Monroe's jeweller of choice - the diamond producer has dug up some of the largest most valuable gems in the world. Gem Diamonds sold the 164 carat type IIa rough diamond 'of an exceptional quality' for £6m . In addition to the recovery of the 164 carat diamond, a 103 carat gem was also recovered from the Main pipe . In 2011 they uncovered the world's 14th biggest white diamond from their South African Letšeng mine - which they sold for £11million in the rough - and now, the same fruitful bit of land has sprouted another super gem. The 164 carat beast was discovered on April 30 and has already been sold in the rough for £6million. These diamonds and anything of their size are rare to recover, especially when they are of high first class quality. Though the real test to find the gem's worth comes now as it's currently being computer analysed in Antwerp, Belgium, as experts look for flaws and weaknesses - but say it's value can only increase. Marilyn Monroe, on the set of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, was a fan of Harry Winston, one of Gem's clients . Large round cut diamonds are in high . demand at the moment, so Gem might be hoping to find a part of the stone . suitable for this purpose. Gem tell the MailOnline that the manufacturing process is a complicated one to understand: . 'The 164ct is an exceptional D colour, type IIa rough diamond with the potential to yield flawless polished diamonds. 'The . initial analysis, using Gem Diamonds' high tech computerised analytical . capability in Antwerp (Baobab Technologies) revealed a number of . potential polished options with respect to quantity, size, shape and . clarity of the individual polished diamonds. 'Now that the diamond has been sold, it . will be sent for closer examination, where windows (polished surfaces) are opened onto the stone to allow for greater accuracy in determining . the most optimal polished value through the use of computer algorithms. 'While South African diamonds have in the past faced controversy over being a potential produce of conflict, Gem pride themselves in complying with the Kimberley Process' 'The most optimal solution from a . valuation and marketing perspective will then be chosen and the stone . will then be laser sawn into a number of pieces, shaped and then . polished to deliver the potentially flawless polished diamonds. 'These . large high value polished diamonds are eventually purchased by the . highest end retail brands, such as Graff, Harry Winston and Moussaieff . etc. and are set into unique pieces of jewellery for sale to their high . net worth customers.' While South African diamonds have in . the past faced controversy over being a potential produce of conflict, . Gem pride themselves in complying with the Kimberley Process established . in 2003 to prevent conflict (blood) diamonds from entering the . mainstream rough diamond market. A spokesman said: 'Gem Diamonds continues to comply with Kimberley Process initiative. 'The . Gem Diamonds Group is committed to the principles and practices of . sustainable development and  believe an active and engaged approach to . sustainability to be key to their ability to meet responsibilities to . all stakeholders: shareholders, employees, communities and the . environment.' The diamond, recovered from the Main . pipe at the Letšeng mine, is expected to produce top colour and top . clarity polished diamonds and has been sold into a profit sharing . arrangement for £6million (£37,000 per carat), whereby the rough . price is received upfront. The 550 carat diamond, the world's 13th biggest ever (l) and a pair of Graff earrings made with Gem stones (r) Letšeng Diamonds will benefit further from a significant share of the downstream polished margin from the sale of the polished diamonds. Further work focusing on reducing diamond damage at Letšeng continues and it is pleasing to report that in addition to the recovery of the 164 carat diamond, a 103 carat diamond was also recovered from the Main pipe during May 2013 and that both diamonds were undamaged. The 103 carat diamond, which is not of the same high quality as the 164 carat diamond, will be sold on the next tender in June. Gem Diamonds CEO, Clifford Elphick stated: 'The recovery and sale of this high quality 164 carat white diamond reinforces Letšeng's position as the premier source of exceptional diamonds.'

"The elderly former neighbour of Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf and his Muslim convert wife Tara Nettleton has revealed what it was like to live next door to the couple before they fled to Syria with their five children. Sharrouf, who is wanted by Australian Federal Police after he began fighting with terrorist organisation Islamic State, posted a photo of his seven-year-old son on Twitter holding up a decapitated head in the Middle East this week with the caption 'that's my boy'. The image shocked the world and led to the boy’s Australian grandfather, Peter Nettleton, demanding the couple’s children be brought home to Australia. Pensioner Joyce, who has lived in south-west Sydney for more than 30 years, said she was 'shocked' and 'disgusted' to see the photo of her former young neighbour. Scroll down for video . Joyce lived near Khaled Sharrouf, his wife Tara and their children, before he was arrested on terrorism charges in 2005 . 'Kids at their age should be playing with toy guns,’ she said. Joyce told Daily Mail Australia Sharrouf's wife Tara was always 'very polite' but things changed when she once commented on Tara wearing a niqab. 'We get on well until one day I saw her watering the garden, I said: ""You're too pretty to wear those things"". She never spoke to me again after then,' Joyce said. She described Tara as a typical blonde Australian woman and said her children -  two girls and three boys - were also pleasant. 'She was quite tall, a solid girl,' she added. Khaled Sharrouf's seven-year-old son (left) was pictured holding up a severed head in a photo on Twitter posted by Sharrouf on Sunday.  Sharrouf (right) has also posted photos of himself holding up severed heads . Sharrouf also uploaded a photo of him and his sons dressed in identical camouflage fatigues wielding machine guns . ‘Tara used to go out the back and sit on the step with her mum Karen in shorts but when the men came home she would cover up,’ Joyce added. Joyce said Tara, who had her first child with Sharrouf when she was just 17, was ‘always coming and going with her mum who picked her up.’ Her mother Karen allegedly helped Tara flee to Malaysia with her children, where she claimed she would live with Sharrouf's sister, at the beginning of the year. Her move came after Sharrouf escaped Australian authorities by using his brother’s passport to fly to Syria in December. Joyce said she was not always worried about living next door to the couple until police helicopters descended on their small road in 2005. Daily Mail Australia has elected not to show her face. ‘Her husband [Sharrouf] often had all his friends out the front talking,' Joyce said. Joyce said Tara, who had her first child with Sharrouf when she was just 17, was 'always coming and going with her mum who picked her up.' Joyce said Tara looked like a typical blonde Australian woman and that she used to be polite to her . She said Sharrouf used to come home at 3am after being out with his friends and bang on the door saying ‘Tara let me in’. But she said the family were ‘a very quiet family’ most of the time. Her only conversation with Sharrouf, who she described as ‘arrogant’, was when she asked him to board up a hole in his fence because their kittens climbed under it into her garden. ‘The kids used to play out the back. The fence had a gap underneath it. He said “I’ll do it when I’m ready”.’ After the police raid on their home, Sharrouf was arrested in 2005 and was sentenced to five years' in jail for possessing items in preparation for a terrorist act. The house where Khaled Sharrouf lived with his family in 2005 before the house was raided by police and he was convicted on terrorism charges . Tara wrote a letter to the court explaining how, when he was released in 2009, they wanted to move to the country for a quiet life on a farm. She claimed they wanted to bring up their kids safely. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the estranged stepmother of Tara Nettleton told Daily Mail Australia said Ms Nettleton was 'just a normal girl' growing up. Sue Nettleton explained her and Tara’s father, Peter, don't know anything about what has happened to Tara and Sharrouf’s children. Khaled Sharrouf and Tara Nettleton met at Chester Hill High School. He was two years older than her . Tara lost contact with her dad and stepmother over nine years ago, around the time she converted to Islam. 'I'm scared for the children,' truck driver Peter Nettleton told The Daily Telegraph on Tuesday. However, Mr Nettleton said he doesn't even know the name of his grandchildren. 'She just went with him and converted, she never grew up religious, we weren’t religious,' he added. Meanwhile, Tara's former friends have told how she and Sharrouf - who is two years older than her - got together at Chester Hill High School in Sydney's west. He was expelled in year nine for hitting another student, The Australian reports, but they continued to date and both became strict Muslims. They got married and moved to the bungalow near Joyce.

"He  is one of Australia's most notorious murderers, torturing and killing 10 people in a bloody spree for which he has never shown remorse. But now Snowtown serial killer Robert Wagner has made an astonishing appeal for 'female friends' to write to him in the cell at Yatala Labour Prison, in South Australia, where he is serving ten life sentences with no chance of parole. 'Hi, my name is Robert and I'm looking for females to write to,' the 42-year-old states on the website PrisonPenPals.com. 'Feel free to ask me anything and I'll reply as honestly as possible.' The Department of Correctional Services have asked for his profile to be taken down, according to Adelaide Now. The serial killer's profile on the Prison Pen Pals website, in which Robert Wagner seeks to exchanging 'interesting mail' with females. Wagner, one of Australia's worst ever murderers writes 'Feel free to ask me anything and I'll reply as honestly as possible.' Robert Wagner, in blue shirt in handcuffs, pictured in 2002 during his murder trial for the brutal murder of 10 people. Wagner was given 10 life sentences and has no chance of parole. In a statement issued to the newspaper, officials said that they are also monitoring his mail to intercept any correspondence elicited by the online ad. 'No prisoner in South Australia is permitted Internet access and any prisoner profile listed on this or similar sites would have been created by someone external to the correctional facility,' they said. 'The Department first and foremost has a duty of care to victims of crime and does not condone the activities of the prisoner pal website in question.' It is believed a friend on the outside has set up the account for Wagner, on the US-based website that connects prisoners with people on the outside. Wagner met John Bunting, the ringleader of the Snowtown murders, in 1991. They committed their first murder the next year and went on killing until 1999. One of the victims was Wagner's former lover, homosexual cross dresser Barry Lane with whom he was in a relationship from 1985 until around 1996. They had begun seeing each other when Wagner was 14 and Lane was 31. Wagner tortured and strangled Lane in 1997. Robert Wagner, pictured in 2002, being escorted by a court sheriff outside the house in Snowtown, where for a time Wagner stored the bodies in barrels in the driveway in the back of a car. The photograph was taken when the jury in the bodies-in-the-barrels trial visited the small town for the trial. The bodies of the victims were stored in barrels and the gang moved the bodies numerous times, keeping the mutilated remains in places including a shed behind Bunting's house and in a Toyota Land Cruiser in Adelaide Plains. In 1999, eight dismembered bodies were found in six barrels in a disused bank vault in Snowtown, a small town 145km north of Adelaide. Wagner was convicted of ten of the killings in December 2003 when he was 31 and became one of a small group of criminals including backpacker murders killer Ivan Milat, serial sex killer Peter Dupas and Port Arthur gunman Martin Bryant who will never have the chance of parole. In the most gruesome evidence, jurors heard that he and Bunting had fried and eaten their final victim's flesh. Sentencing, Justice Brian Martin stated that the men were 'in the business of killing for pleasure' and 'incapable of true rehabilitation.' Robert Wagner stored dismembered bodies in barrels at the back of a 4wd in the driveway of this home in Snowtown. The bodies were found when the barrel's were transferred to a bank vault for storage. Robert Wagner, pictured second from left in handcuffs, being escorted by police through the town of Snowtown during his trial for murder in 2002. In the background is a brick building, in which eight bodies were discovered in 1999. The trial was the longest trial in Australian criminal history. Three jurors walked away, unable to stomach the disturbing evidence. Prosecutor Wendy Abraham, QC, told the jury than 'enjoyment' was a motive in the murders. 'Mr Bunting and My Wagner bragged - they laughed about what they were doing,' Ms Abraham told the court. The jury in the Snowtown Murder trial was shown a poem, believed to be written by Robert Wagner whilst in custody to a fellow prisoner. The disturbing poem, dated August 2000, is written in childish handwriting, explaining how he has 'provided a service' to the community because 'our street should be weeded.' 'I will not ever be held in contempt, for everyone knows my time was well spent,' the poem says, revealing the disturbing mindset of a deranged killer with no remorse.

"Former NSW Police Detective Sergeant Peter Moroney listened to Sharrouf's phone calls for months . When the Sydney home of convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf was raided in November 2005 police found 'thousands of images of beheaded US soldiers'. Nine years later, Sharrouf has evaded Australian authorities and fled to Syria, where he is bragging about his own sick beheadings and even posting a photo on Twitter of his seven-year-old son holding up a severed head. A lead investigator in Operation Pendennis, which originally busted Sharrouf as part of a large terrorist cell planning to carry out attacks in Sydney and Melbourne in 2005, has told Daily Mail Australia he always predicted Sharrouf would continue his radical beliefs once he left prison in 2009. 'Like everyone my initial reaction on seeing that image of his son was absolute disgust. But having known him, and reflecting on what we knew of him back then, it doesn't surprise me he went down this path,’ former NSW Police Detective Sergeant Peter Moroney said. From listening in to Sharrouf’s phone conversations Mr Moroney quickly got a sense of Sharrouf’s radical beliefs. 'He would talk about his children but they were young. He’d have conversations about how the children’s grandparents were Kafir [non-believers] and he told their mother to keep them away from them.' ‘That brainwashing started from a young age,’ he said. Khaled Sharrouf (right) was monitored by NSW Police for months before his arrest in 2005. Since he fled Australia in December on his brother's passport he has been taunting authorities with photos of his children holding guns (left) Mr Moroney was one of a number of detectives who listened in to Sharrouf's disturbing phone calls to friends and family in the months leading up to the dramatic raid on his house in Wiley Park, south-east Sydney, in November 2005. After storming his home, officers found 'a vast number of documents in relation to jihad', Mr Moroney said. 'He was not a mastermind he was more of a muscle type of role,' he added. It was one of many early morning swoops across Victoria and NSW, that involved 400 police and 23 search warrants, following an 18-month anti-terrorism operation code-named Operation Pendennis. The operation, involving Victoria Police, ASIO and the Australian Federal Police, obtained 16,400 hours of secret recording including 98,000 phone intercepts. Mr Moroney listened in to a large number of Sharrouf's phone calls and said he was a 'domineering' man. He heard Sharrouf refusing to allow his parents-in-law to visit his children with wife, Tara Nettleton. ‘He often refused his Australian in-laws to visit the children because they were Catholics,’ Mr Moroney explained. Khaled Sharrouf's seven-year-old son (left) was pictured holding up a severed head in a photo on Twitter posted by Sharrouf on Sunday.  Sharrouf (right) has also posted photos of himself holding up severed heads . The former detective said Sharrouf spoke to his wife Tara on the phone every day. 'He was quiet a domineering person ... he was the male of the house and she was the female of the house and that’s how it was,’ he said. Up to 17 people were arrested, including nine suspects in Melbourne and eight people in Sydney – one of whom was Sharrouf - during the November raids. Most of the suspects were in their mid-20s and, like Sharrouf, were married with children. Sharrouf and his blonde Australian Muslim convert wife Tara met at Chester Hill High School, before he was reportedly expelled in year nine. They both converted to Islam and got married, with Tara giving birth to their first child at the age of 17. The couple now have five children, who are all believed to be living in the Middle East after Tara fled Sydney. She left the country with her kids shortly after Sharrouf escaped Australian authorities by using his brother’s passport. Khaled Sharrouf was arrested in 2005 in a raid on his Wiley Park home in Sydney's west. He was 28-years-old . He travelled to Kuala Lumpar and onto Iraq and is now believed to be fighting with Islamic State in Syria, alongside his friend Mohamed Elomar. The Australian Federal Police recently issued arrest warrants for both men. After the raid in 2005, Sharrouf pleaded guilty in the NSW Supreme Court to possessing goods in preparation for a terrorist act and served almost four years in jail. While appearing in court, he was deemed to be mentally unwell and classed as schizophrenic. Tara wrote a letter to the court explaining that when he was released in 2009 they wanted to move to the country for a quiet life on a farm. She claimed they wanted to bring up their children safely. Mr Moroney doubts Sharrouf’s schizophrenic claims are legitimate. 'I’m no medical doctor but in addition to terrorism, he was also arrested for minor motor offences. He could have said he was schizophrenic to get off … he was certainly aware of what he needed to do manipulate the system.’ This is the house where Sharrouf lived with his wife Tara Nettleton and children before he was jailed in 2005 . ‘He's not intelligent … you’ve got to accept he’s been classed as schizophrenic but he seemed to function in normal life until he was arrested,’ Mr Moroney explained. Indeed, just last week Sharrouf claimed he put on his schizophrenic symptoms to fool the criminal justice system. ‘I played the government like ignorant children,’ he said from Syria, The Australian reports. ‘I was never mentally ill, not then, nor now.’ Mr Moroney said the house that Sharrouf lived in with his wife and children was just like any other western Sydney home. ‘I think it was a three bedroom, one bathroom, style of residence and perhaps housing commission,’ he said. Sharrouf is now believed to be fighting with the Islamic State organisation in Syria alongside fellow Sydney man Mohamed Elomar . Mr Moroney believes instead of focusing on Sharrouf's actions in Syria we should be concerned about how he became indoctrinated in Australia . Mr Moroney believes instead of focusing on Sharrouf’s actions in Syria we should be concerned about how he became indoctrinated in Australia. 'Some of the things we miss at the moment while he's over there is he was bred here, so how and why did he become so indoctrinated into such hate? ‘He was indoctrinated, groomed and trained in this country... people have got to realise that.’ Mr Moroney, who began counter-terrorism work in 2003 but left the NSW police division in 2011 to start up his own private investigations firm with his father Ken Moroney, a former NSW Commissioner of Police, also believes revoking suspects’ passports is not the answer to preventing terrorism. Sharrouf met his blonde Australian wife Tara at Chester Hill High School, before he was reportedly expelled in year nine . ‘It might stop them from going overseas and fighting but they can still plot attacks from Australia,’ he said. The 40-year-old explained fighting terrorism is not just an issue for the police, ASIO or the Islamic community. ‘They can’t do it on their own,’ he said. He said since he start working in counter-terrorism the work has increased ‘tenfold and it’s still increasing today’. ‘It’s not something that's going to go away. People's beliefs don't go away. You're investigating a belief system and what’s driving them is their beliefs. It’s not like drug crimes that are motivated by money or greed. It’s hard to police.’","Former NSW Police Detective Sergeant Peter Moroney listened to Sharrouf's conversations for 18-months .

"A former ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan was being investigated by U.S. authorities for suspected money laundering through his wife's bank account. The suspicions center on Zalmay Khalilzad's alleged transfer of  $1.5 million in May 2013 to an account in Vienna owned by Cheryl Benard. State prosecutor Thomas Vecsey on Monday confirmed a report by the Austrian magazine Profil but declined to give details. Former US ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad (pictured in 2007) allegedly transferred $1.5million to a bank account in Vienna in his wife's name . The money allegedly came from oil and building deals in Iraq and the United Arab Emirates which violated U.S. law, according to Bloomberg. Cheryl Benard's bank account in Vienna has been frozen by Austrian authorities . Documents on the case were found in a garbage container used by the state prosecutor's office in Vienna, the magazine reported. Benard's account has been frozen by Austrian authorities. Khalilzad was ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the U.N. under President George W. Bush. He briefly served as counselor to former Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld. Benard's lawyer, Holger Bielesz, said that U.S. authorities have yet to express 'reasonable grounds for suspicions'. The former diplomat is president of Khalilzad Associates, an international business consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. Under its parent company Gryphon Investors, Khalilzad's firm is focused on business in Iraq and Afghanistan. Gryphon Investors were unavailable for comment on Monday. In 2003, Khalilzad was appointed as U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan. He was in the role until 2005 where he oversaw the country's first elections and was a close adviser to Afghan President Hamid Karzai. He served as U.S. ambassador to Iraq from 2005-2007 before becoming the country's UN ambassador. Cheryl Benard is president of a DC non-profit research group which supports cultural activism in former war zones. Mr Khalilzad, 63, and his wife have two sons, Alexander and Maximilian.

"A cat owner spent six days in hospital with blood poisoning after her Persian pet sank its claws into her elbow when she tried to give it a bath. Lesley Pleasant, 57, was trying to get rid of Oscar's fleas when the 10-month-old Persian cat 'flew' up her arm before digging its sharp nails into her artery. Oscar was so scared that it took Mrs Pleasant's 16-year-old daughter Alisha 30 seconds to remove its claws from her arm after the attack at their house in Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Scroll down for video . Lesley Pleasant, 57, was trying to get rid of Oscar's fleas when the  Persian cat attacked her arm . Just hours later the mother-of-one's arm had ballooned to twice its size and she began to feel so ill she could not get out of bed. The PE teacher and gymnastics coach was rushed to hospital where staff quickly diagnosed septicaemia, or blood poisoning. If not treated promptly, septic shock can develop, causing organ failure and death in some patients. 'He doesn't like to be groomed, so I decided I'd try to give him a bath first - I have another Persian, and a dog, and they are both fine with being bathed, but Oscar really wasn't,' said Mrs Pleasant. Just hours after the attack, the mother-of-one's arm had ballooned to twice its size and she began to feel ill . Oscar, a 10-month-old Persian cat, does not like being groomed or bathed by his owners . 'He flew up my arm, and my daughter had to ease his claws out of my skin. 'I was covered in scratches, but one, on the inside of my elbow was really deep. It hurt like anything, but it didn't bleed, so I just got on with my day. 'I've never felt like that before,' she added. 'I had this terrible headache, and I couldn't move my arm.' Mrs Pleasant started to feel ill just hours after the attack and began suffering from a high temperature, headache and stiff arm. By 2am, she was feeling worse, and by 3am she could not get out of bed. 'About 5am, I used my mobile phone to call my daughter, who sleeps in the room next to me,' she said. 'If I had any sense, I would have gone and got treatment right after the scratch. Mrs Pleasant started to feel ill just hours after the attack and began suffering from a high temperature, headache and stiff arm . 'My arm had swollen up and looked like one of those long, sausage balloons you get. 'Once the paracetamol started to work, I felt well enough to drive myself to hospital - except that the hospital was closed. 'So I had to go back home and wait a few more hours for it to open.' Staff quickly saw the ill mother and she was transferred to nearby Bath Royal United Hospital where she was whisked through to a ward. 'I threw up in the car all the way there. When I arrived in A&E, they whisked me through straight away, got me into a bed and put me on a drip,' said Mrs Pleasant. The drip which should have helped, instead brought her out in a rash, and three days later, doctors established she had a penicillin allergy. After a change of medication and six days in hospital she was allowed to go home. 'From now on, my cats are having their flea treatments by injection - it's so much easier,' she said. Septicaemia is a life-threatening condition where bacteria invade the bloodstream. It is usually triggered by an infection in another part of the body, such as pneumonia, meningitis, bladder infections or even a tooth abscess. The bacteria escape from this initial infection and enter the blood, causing a series of reactions that can lead to swelling of the blood vessels and blood clots. The condition can occur after a miscarriage if any foetal tissue left inside the body becomes infected. There are about 300,000 cases a year and up to 15,000 deaths. If untreated, it develops into septic shock, where blood pressure drops and organs fail.","Lesley Pleasant, 57, Shepton Mallet, was trying to give her Persian cat a bath .

"A retired NYPD deputy inspector has revealed his shocking ties to violent gangs and drug-dealing before he joined the force. Retired officer Corey Pegues admitted that he once attempted murder and was good friends with a notorious, cop-killing crack dealer. Mr Pegues revealed his dark secrets on a podcast last month as part of the promotion for his upcoming book, From The Streets To The Beat - much to the anger of fellow officers. Retired NYPD deputy inspector Corey Pegues (left and right) admitted that he once attempted murder and was good friends with a cop-killing crack dealer when he was in gangs before joining the force in his mid-twenties . The statute of limitations has handily expired on 45-year-old Mr Pegues' alleged crimes meaning he is beyond the reach of any court, leaving him to enjoy his $135,000 disability pension (which is also tax free). Mr Pegues left the police force at the age of 45 in 2013, after more than 20 years service. He had reached the rank of deputy inspector at the 67th Precinct in East Flatbush. He publicly shared the years that he spent in the drug and gang underworlds in his teens and early twenties in Queens, according to the New York Post. During the interview, Pegues said he had been on the streets since the age of 13 when he began selling loose joints to help provide for his family. 'In the late 80s, it almost seemed like the thing to do,' he told the show. Pegues said that he always traveled 'strapped' as a young teen - carrying a .22 nickel-plated gun. The former cop also admitted how close he had come to killing a rival drug-dealer - but his weapon misfired. He told the podcast: 'I was maybe like 17. I was like, ''Yo, I’m going to murder him''... It was all about street cred.' He also claimed that he trusted no one on the streets as that was the best way to survive after bragging about owning piles of expensive trainers and gold chains with his name in diamonds. Pegues, who is married and has a daughter in the NYPD, revealed he was friends with cop killer David McClary. McClary shot rookie cop Eddie Byrne, who was alone in a squad car  in February 1988, protecting the home of a witness in a drug case who had been threatened by dealers. The retired cop revealed in an interview last month that he was friends with cop-killer David McClary who shot dead rookie officer Eddie Byrne while he was protecting a witness's home in 1988 . It was about 3am and he was alone at the wheel when five bullets were pumped into his head. Days earlier, a powerful drug dealer had ordered a hit from jail on any cop as payback for his arrest and offered $8,000 as a reward. Pegues also used his interview to say that he believed Eric Garner - who died after being put in a chokehold by a Staten Island cop in July - was murdered. He said: 'I'm a cop with 22 years service and for the record, Eric Garner was murdered.' MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the NYPD today but on a popular cop website, The Rant, one user posted the podcast and wrote: 'If you can stomach this interview it starts at around the 13:00 minute mark. 'He talks about running with a gang, selling drugs and even witnessing murder. Amazing that this perp was a DI. What an embarrassment to the department.' The NYPD has a strict vetting process for new employees but since Pegues sailed through unnoticed, he presumably was not charged with any crime and kept his past a secret. Pegues, an NYPD inspector with 22 years service who recently retired, is currently promoting his new book about his time as a teenage gang-banger .","Retired officer Corey Pegues admitted that he once attempted to shoot a rival drug dealer and was good friends with a notorious cop killer .

"It has a long and hallowed history within American political tradition, but is anyone better at having their photograph taken with children and babies than Barack Obama? Indeed, a fresh batch of pictures taken over the summer and released by the White House this week leave no doubt that when it comes to that all important clinch with the kids, no one comes close to the current commander in chief. Mainly taken in and around the White House, the photographs with the children reveal the president at arguably his most natural and comfortable, hardly surprising given the stresses and strains as the leader of the free world. From a little boy who has face-planted himself into one of the Oval Office sofa's while his Secret Service agent father departs the president's security detail, to golfer Hunter Mahan's smiling daughter, Zoe, the joyous pictures lay bare Obama's softer side. So sure is his touch in front of the camera with youngsters that it cuts a stark contrast with Sunday's claim from the president that the theater of the presidency does not come naturally to him.

"Australia chef Matt Moran has officially been confirmed as the owner of the first major food venue at Sydney's new Barangaroo development. The celebrity chef will open a dramatic three-level establishment in the exclusive harbourside spot after securing a 10-year lease. The announcement was made on Monday by Barangaroo developers Lend Lease and is a joint venture between Moran, his business partner Peter Sullivan from MorSul, and Bruce Solomon and Anna Solomon from Solotel. Scroll down for video . On Monday morning it was announced celebrity chef Matt Moran will open a three-level venue at Barangaroo . The eatery will resemble three bowls stacked on top of each other with each level providing a different experience . The outside of the restaurant has been designed to resemble three bowls stacked on top of each other. It was designed by Sydney architects Collins and Turner, who have also created a number of bars for craft beer company James Squire. 'It's a big move for us, it's a big space,' Moran told Good Food. 'It's three concepts in one building so it is one of the biggest things I've ever done,' he continued. On the first level of the venue will be a relaxed eatery, on the second a restaurant and the top floor will boast a spectacular rooftop garden bar. It is a joint venture between Moran, his business partner Peter Sullivan from MorSul, and Bruce Solomon and Anna Solomon from Solotel . The chef's portfolio already includes restaurants such as Aria, Chiswick, North Bondi Fish and Opera Bar . Spanning a huge 1500 square metres, the establishment - which is yet to be names - will have an Australian concept with a local wine list. The restaurant will open in March 2016 and construction has already begun on the venue, which will be just one of more than 50 restaurants, cafes and bars set to pop up as part of the development. Moran's current portfolio includes Aria - a hatted restaurant which overlooks Sydney Harbour - and the nearby Opera Bar, which he just signed a renewed 10-year lease on. Moran and Sullivan's new venture - which is yet be to named - will open at Barangaroo in March 2016 . Chiswick in Woollahra - which grows much of its own produce - and North Bondi Fish are also run by Moran and Sullivan. However the latest venture will provide a different dining experience to all the other venues and is part of the wider $6 billion project at Barangaroo. Moran has been a guest chef on Channel 10's Masterchef program for many years, and now stars in his own show Paddock to Plate which recently kicked off its second season.","The three-level venture will open in March 2016 at Barangaroo .

"A northwestern Indiana police officer has died after being shot in an apparent ambush by a man who subsequently killed himself. Merrillville police Officer Nickolaus Schultz had been on the police force for about a year when he was shot in the head Friday night. Police spokesman Robert Byrd says the 24-year-old Schultz died Sunday. Merrillville police Officer Nickolaus Schultz had been on the police force for about a year when he was shot in the head Friday night . A vigil was held for Schultz, who died while responding to a call about a 33-year-old man moving back into a condo he'd been evicted from . CBS Chicago reports Schultz was one of several officers who responded to a complaint at a condo at 8219 Lincoln Circle when it was discovered an evicted man had moved back in. The man, 33-year-old Michael Hernciar, was wearing body armor when police arrived shot Schultz in the head. A SWAT team was called in to retrieve Schultz, who may have been pulled into the condo by Hernciar. Hernciar was found dead on the scene, though it's still uncertain whether he took his own life or was killed by police gunfire. The bomb squad was also called in as it's believed Hernciar had some type of explosive hidden. Residents were evacuated while the police secured the area. Schultz was taken to Christ Hospital in critical condition and was pronounced dead Sunday. Schultz graduated last year from central Indiana's Franklin College, where he was a football captain . Neighbor Derrick Blakley told reporters he think Hernciar broke under the pressure after a series of traumatic events. 'He lost his job not too long ago,' Blakley said. 'I think it's just a spiraling effect. Lost his job, lost his home.' Schultz graduated last year from central Indiana's Franklin College, where he was a football captain.

"In heart-rending scenes after the mass at Holy Cross Church, Charleville, County Cork, white coffins holding the bodies of nine-year-old Thomas and Patrick O'Driscoll were carried shoulder high through the town. The deaths of twin boys and their older brother in an apparent murder-suicide should be a lesson for people to do more to get young men to talk about their problems, it was said at their funeral. As the remains of their elder brother Jonathan, 22, were kept in the church, the funeral cortege was led by about 30 youngsters walking behind a pick-up truck carrying huge and ornately decorated floral tributes. They were followed by a pony pulling a miniature canvas-covered caravan decorated with pictures of the twins. Helen O'Driscoll (centre) carries the coffin of one of her twin boys Thomas and Patrick O'Driscoll who died in a suspected murder suicide with their older sibling Jonathan during their funeral in Charleville, County Cork .

Jonathan O'Driscoll (back) with his brothers. Patrick (left) and Thomas. The 22-year-old's body was found 10 miles away from the crime scene . It is thought that the twins were stabbed to death by Jonathan, who fled the scene and was found dead around an hour later about 10 miles from the home in a wooded area next to a river just outside Buttevant. It appears that he took his own life. The boys' parents, Helen and Thomas, had travelled to Waterford last Thursday - the day of their deaths - to buy the wagon as a present for them. On top of a black hearse sat a second set of beautifully decorated wreaths, including a replica of the old-style traveller caravan, two crossed blue and white hurleys and a horseshoe. Black and red boxing gloves rested on the boys' coffins during the service. Loss: The cortege was followed by a pony pulling a miniature canvas-covered caravan decorated with pictures of the twins . In a moving homily Father Tom Naughton, curate at Holy Cross, said explanations for the boys' deaths will not be answered 'this side of the grave'. 'But if these days have taught us anything at all, they challenge us to continue and to increase our efforts to understand and to assist, especially young males, to communicate the darkness that seems to be increasingly troubling young minds and hearts,' the local priest said. 'It is possible that we have never had more activities and recreations, all sorts of noises and acquaintances around us yet, at the same time, it seems that never have people been so lonely and lonesome.' Thomas and Patrick were buried together in Charleville cemetery following the mass. Jonathan's remains were held in the church for several hours and he was later laid to rest with his maternal grandparents in Kilmallock. Grief: Parents Thomas and Helen O'Driscoll (centre) walk in front of the cortege . Among the many wreaths and floral tributes were simple messages from the family including 'Our son Jonathan' and 'Our boys Tom Tom and Paddy' Fr Naughton said the O'Driscoll parents had revealed the true character of their twin boys in the days since their deaths. Tom Tom and Paddy, as they were affectionately known, loved playing with friends, they were honest, they knew how to say sorry and they were famous for their hugs, mourners were told. The boys took pride in achieving at school and they took care of each other and stood up for each other. There were also special words for Jonathan. Fr Naughton revealed his arrival into the O'Driscoll family was the happiest day of Helen and Thomas' lives. He said his grandfather Da was dying in intensive care at the time but when the proud parents showed Jonathan to him through a window in the unit the joy seemed to help him rally. 'Jonathan made the whole family happy. He was there when you needed him and could pop up at any stage. He loved all his godchildren and never forgot their birthdays,' Fr Naughton said. Mourners heard how Jonathan would buy outfits for his godchildren in Dunnes, how he took the twins hunting and to Doneraile Park to play. 'It was their favourite place,' the priest said. The mass also heard how Jonathan got both boys special custom-printed books for Christmas and Patrick had brought his to school and was proud of it. The hundreds of mourners at the mass heard the youngsters were lovable rogues, fun-loving and energetic boys who loved their parents . Among the many wreaths and floral tributes were simple messages from the family including 'Our son Jonathan' and 'Our boys Tom Tom and Paddy'. Another was marked 'Tom Tom and Paddy' with two hurleys on green fields symbolising one of their favourite sports. Many other tributes carried symbols of horses and horseshoes and one, made in the shape of a red car, carried the number nine, the twin boys' age. The hundreds of mourners at the mass heard the youngsters were lovable rogues, fun-loving and energetic boys who loved their parents. Fr Naughton said many people had expressed the wish to take the pain from the O'Driscoll parents in the days since the tragedy. 'Helen and Thomas, ever so many people want to embrace you and your family so that you may know that you are not alone and we don't want you ever to feel alone because we are and will continue to be there for you,' the priest said. The twins were found dead in the family home in Charleville last Thursday. Within an hour of the discovery their older sibling Jonathan, in his early 20s, was found dead about 15km away in a wooded area by a river just outside the town of Buttevant. It is believed he died by suicide. Experts from the national education psychological service of the Department of Education have been called in to support school staff in dealing with the tragedy. Elsewhere, the Health Service Executive was working with community health workers from the Travellers of North Cork association to support immediate and extended family. If the murder-suicide suspicions are confirmed, it will be the second incident of its kind in Ireland in just over six weeks.

Yesterday parents Graham and Cherie told of their horror at how Brett and Naghemeh King had been treated in their fight to save their sons life. Mrs Gillon, who is a stay at home mother, 27, believes there should be more NHS funding for the proton beam therapy treatment. She said: 'I feel for the King family because they're just parents that want their child to live for the longest he can and I'd do the same in their shoes. 'They're trying to do what's best for their child. That's their little boy and any parent would do the same. 'I agree that the doctors know best but if someone is saying, ""yes there is a treatment there but you're not having it"", that's unfair.' Lilly pictured six weeks ago with her patient liason team at the Oklahoma Proton Therapy Centre . The Gillon family together at their home in Birmingham (left) and Lilly playing with her toys (right) Mrs Gillon first noticed that Lilly was ill in October 2010 when she stopped eating, walking and talking, and began vomiting. In February 2011, she was diagnosed with ependymoma, a rare form of brain tumor that affects one in 68million. Doctors advised that proton beam therapy was the best course of treatment and her parents were successful when they applied for NHS funding. Three months later, Lilly, was sent from Birmingham Children's Hospital to a treatment centre in Oklahoma, America, for the proton beam therapy . The toddler, from Kingstanding, Birmingham, received a 33-session treatment across eight weeks and the tumour was successfully removed. Although the couple were relieved that Lilly's funding was approved, they have found it difficult to accept that other children were rejected. Mrs Gillon said: 'Lil went up to the hospital board against another little girl and Lilly got the yes and the little girl got a no, and when we got back from having the treatment, the little girl had died. That was so incredibly sad.' Mr Gillon, 36, agreed: 'For anyone to be told they can't have that treatment, that's devastating, especially after knowing how well it has worked for Lil. 'As far as taking the child out of hospital, for me that's a massive act of desperation. Lilly and her parents Cherie and Graham were lucky to get approval for NHS funding for the £50,000 treatment . Lilly, pictured at her Birmingham home, is required to undergo scans every three months . 'We had moments where we didn't agree with the doctors and what they were doing but we sat there and debated it with them and luckily they took what we said on board.' Proton Beam therapy is a type of radiation therapy which uses beams of protons directed precisely at a tumour. The beams are more focused and less likely to damage healthy tissues around tumours when they destroy cancer cells. Unfortunately, Lilly's type of cancer is classed as terminal and the tumour will eventually start to grow again. But her parents say the therapy has given her a better quality of life. Mr Gillon added: 'Before the therapy she would be in bed all day. She wasn't able to speak or walk but now she is bubbly and loves to play with her sisters. 'There was none of the sickness you get with conventional radiotherapy. 'There is no knowing how long we have her for but people with ependymoma have been known to live until 40. 'Lilly has scans every three months to check that the tumor is stable but try not to think about the future too much and just take each day as it comes. 'Ever since the treatment she's been healthy.' Consultant paediatric oncologist, Bruce Morland, from Birmingham Children's Hospital, insisted a child's referral for proton treatment was treated on a case-by-case basis. He said: 'The selection process for proton treatment is based individual cases and the type of tumour. Lilly is about to start school today after undergoing the radical treatment as a baby in 2011 . Lilly with her mother Cherie Gillon at home. Mrs Gillon said Lilly is now  bubbly and loves to play with her sisters . Graham and Cherie were relieved Lilly's funding was accepted but found it hard to see others rejected by NHS . 'There is a national panel review for all the referrals in the UK. A hospital team can refer patients when they feel will meet the panels criteria for treatment. 'In Lily's case, ependymoma is a condition which the panel would be open to treating. However that referral would be based on strict criteria the patient has to meet. 'This includes the patient being well enough to travel, no evidence that the disease is spreading and how big and where the tumour is located on the brain. 'Generally speaking if all these criteria are met then it would be a case for referral. 'Protons work like radiotherapy but are used to target a more focused area, in the case of some tumours the whole brain needs treating which would mean proton treatment is no more affective than radiotherapy. 'In the case of Asha King, which is different, his condition may not fall under the criteria.'","Birmingham four-year-old successfully treated with proton beam therapy .

"A victim in the Rotherham abuse scandal claimed today that she told a police and crime commissioner about her grooming ordeal at the hands of an Asian sex gang face-to-face. Shaun Wright, who was the town council's cabinet member for children’s services between 2005 and 2010, has been facing calls to resign as South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner. Now, the victim - who alleges Mr Wright knew for years that local girls were being abused by men - has come forward to protest at his claimed ignorance in the past at the scale of the problem. Scroll down for video . Pressure: Shaun Wright (pictured) is facing calls to resign as South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner . Speaking of his reaction to being told in person more than eight years ago about the abuse scandal, the unnamed woman told The Times: ‘He seemed genuinely shocked. ‘He talked like he was going to go away and see something was done, but we never saw him again. It was the end of it for him, but not for us. I sat 2ft from him and told him really, really private things. ‘I don’t know how he can go on national television and say he wasn’t aware, that he didn’t know anything about it. For years they had all the reports and information, but they just ignored it.’ Last week, Mr Wright defiantly repeated his refusal to quit and insisted he will complete his term of office - but announced that he will not seek re-election to the £85,000-a-year post in 2016. The 46-year-old apologised for his role in the ‘systematic failure’ which allowed the scandal to go undetected for so long, adding: ‘I wish I knew then what I do now.’ What did he know? Shaun Wright was cabinet member for children's services at Rotherham Council (pictured) Mr Wright will face questions from MPs tomorrow about his knowledge of the abuse scandal. He . will appear before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, which . will in addition hear evidence from South Yorkshire Police’s chief . constable David Crompton. 'He talked like he was going to go away and see something was done, but we never saw him again. It was the end of it for him, but not for us' Rotherham abuse victim . It . will also hear from senior Rotherham Council official Joyce Thacker and . NSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless, who is leading a review into . the Home Office’s handling of abuse allegations. Committee . chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘The revelations from the independent inquiry . into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham are deeply troubling. ‘The . committee will be questioning those in positions of authority at the . time that these offences were being committed on how the sexual . exploitation of children on a horrifying scale was allowed to go . unchallenged for so long. ‘We . will also be hearing from Sir Peter Wanless and Richard Whittam QC . about progress in their ongoing review of how the Home Office handled . historical allegations of child abuse.’ Questions: Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz (pictured) said today that the revelations from the independent inquiry into child sex abuse in Rotherham are 'deeply troubling' It was also claimed last week that Mr Wright has received death threats after being embroiled in the damning report published last month and refusing to resign. South Yorkshire Police confirmed it had reviewed the safety of several people since the report's publication - but refused to say whether protection has been stepped up around Mr Wright. The report by independent expert Professor Alexis Jay released last month found at least 1,400 children were abused in the town from 1997 to 2013, largely by men of Pakistani origin. Mr Wright believes it would be a waste of money for him to resign now, triggering a by-election. But he has faced calls to step down from Prime Minister David Cameron, Home Secretary Theresa May and the Labour Party. Sheffield City Council passed a vote of no confidence in him last week. However the police commissioner said he had ‘always acted in the best interests of young people’.

"Under fire Better Together leader Alistair Darling insisted this morning that Scottish voters would reject independence . Better Together leader Alistair Darling this morning insisted he was still ‘very confident’ Scotland would reject independence – as the pound plunged following a surge in support for the ‘Yes’ campaign. Support for independence took the lead this weekend, sparking panic in Westminster. The development has also spooked the markets with the pound slumping to a 10-month low this morning. The 1 per cent fall adds to sharp losses seen last week after an earlier poll revealed gathering momentum for the independence campaign. Sterling had been at a six-year high against the dollar at the end of June. Shares in a series of Scotland's biggest companies also fell this morning. Six of the 10 biggest fallers on the FTSE were Scottish based. Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: ‘For quite some time investors had dismissed the prospect of a Yes vote as an outlier, but recent opinion polls have shifted that perception and this has been no better demonstrated than by the plunge in sterling this morning.’ Mr Hewson added: ‘One thing is certain, if we get this sort of volatility on the prospect of a Yes vote, can you imagine the reaction if we do get a Yes vote? It's not likely to be pretty.’ Mr Darling, the leader of the ‘No’ campaign, this morning tried to calm unions nerves by insisting that Scottish voters would not take the risk of voting for independence next week. He insisted the 'No' campaign were not panicking, but admitted: 'We're in a position now where every voter in Scotland could potentially tip the balance in this referendum.' The former Chancellor added: 'I am confident that we will win, because we do have a very strong positive vision of what Scotland can be, both in terms of the opportunities and the security that comes with being part of the UK, a strengthened Scottish parliament with more powers, which is what people want, and you can do that without having to break up the country to do it.' Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland that the plunge in the pound was the UK Government’s fault. Scroll down for video . She said: 'It's not unusual in political campaigns, or indeed on budget days, for the value of the pound to fluctuate. I think that would suggest that the financial markets see Scotland as a strong economy. 'But, of course, we've made very clear that we want to continue with a currency union. If the UK Government was prepared to sit down with the Scottish Government today, we would do that and it would be within our powers jointly to give reassurance there. 'It is the UK Government that's creating the uncertainty by refusing to have those sensible discussions.' The pound slumped against the US dollar this morning amid growing panic over the prospect of independence . The value of sterling also fell again the struggling Euro as investors panicked over the uncertainty of a UK break up . The Queenis said to be 'concerned' at the prospect of Scotland walking away from the United Kingdom . In 1995 the Canadian province of Quebec voted on whether to secede from Canada. With a month to go, the 'No' camp held a steady lead. But the mood changed with just weeks to go before the referendum. The final polls pointed to a 53-47 per cent victory for Yes. But on the day, some voters pulled back from the brink, and Quebec voted to remain part of Canada by 50.6 per cent to 49.4 per cent. Today’s row came after David Cameron held talks with the Queen in Balmoral yesterday amid growing concern at the prospect of the end of the 300-year-old Union. It emerged today that the Queen, who is thought to strongly favour the Union, will be in Scotland on September 18 – the day it could vote to break away from the rest of the UK. Pro-Union MPs said her presence at Balmoral would be a sign of continuity. A YouGov poll yesterday put support for independence at 51 per cent, with the No camp on 49 per cent. The Better Together campaign has surrendered a 22-point lead in the space of a month. The No campaign is haemorrhaging support among women, working class people and Labour voters. Chancellor George Osborne yesterday announced an 11th hour guarantee to devolve further powers to Scotland over tax, spending, welfare and a host of other areas in a bid to reverse the trend to independence. Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband and Gordon Brown will join forces this week to promise Scotland more powers from London if voters choose to stay in the UK. A cross-party plan for increased control over tax, welfare and job creation in Edinburgh would be announced ‘within days’, said Mr Osborne. Yesterday Peter Kellner, YouGov’s president, said: ‘In the past four weeks, support for the Union has drained away at an astonishing rate. The Yes campaign has not just invaded No territory – it has launched a blitzkrieg.’ Pro-independence campaigners, such as these in Edinburgh, have gained the momentum in the battle to separate from the United Kingdom . Labour MP Jim Murphy was abused and pelted with eggs on a campaign tour against independence . However, a separate poll for the Yes Scotland campaign by pollsters Panelbase put the pro-Union camp still four points ahead – by 52 per cent to 48 per cent. The three main Westminster parties have previously promised further devolution in the event of a No vote, telling Scottish voters they can remain in the UK and ‘have the best of both worlds’. But this week’s promise of a fixed timetable, an attempt to shift away from the widely-criticised negative messages of the No campaign, echoes a similar package offered to the Canadian province of Quebec before an independence referendum in 1995, that snuffed out a late surge in support for breaking away. Mr Osborne also insisted that if Scotland were to opt for independence then under no circumstances would it be able to use the pound as its currency, as Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond says he plan to do. Mr Salmond dismissed the offer of a commission to hammer out new powers for Holyrood as a ‘panicky last-minute measure’. Mr Cameron, at Balmoral yesterday with the Queen, was expected to reassure her that in the closing days of the campaign he intends to make the ‘emotional argument’ about all that England and Scotland have achieved together and what ‘we can continue to achieve’. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown with his wife Sarah out on the streets of his home town Kirkcaldy, Fife, yesterday . Sources have confirmed that the monarch will continue with her annual holiday at her private estate in the Highlands, on September 18. A senior royal source was quoted as saying: ‘The Queen is a Unionist. Lots of people were telling us that it was going to be OK but there is now a great deal of concern.’ A Palace spokesman said: ‘The referendum is a matter for the people of Scotland: the Queen remains strictly neutral on this, as she does on all political issues. The Queen has maintained a close interest in the referendum as she does with all major matters of public debate and is being kept informed by her ministers and officials in the usual way.’","Support for independence took the lead yesterday sparking political panic .

"A 40-year-old man drowned on Sunday night tying to rescue a six-year-old boy who fell into the Hudson River during a community cookout. Several people, including Boyce Coleman, jumped into the river after spotting the boy, Stephan Jones, floundering in the water during a barbecue at JFK Marina in Yonkers shortly before 7pm. Jones was quickly saved and brought to the shore, but Coleman struggled after helping the boy and was pulled under the surface. Boyce Coleman died after jumping into the Hudson River to help rescue a six-year-old boy who slipped in during a community cookout . Coleman was doing 'God's work', said a man known as FWT, who added that he was confident his friend was 'with the Lord' Thelma Martin, mother of the boy who was saved, said she was grateful her boy was saved but saddened at the loss of a friend . Stephan Jones is in stable condition after he was pulled from the river by Coleman and other rescuers . 'He loved life, he gave life,' friend William Van Buren told WABC. 'And he gave his life for a life.' Dive units from Yonkers and the New York Police Department tried to rescue him but weren't able to recover his body for about two hours, according to WABC. Coleman, who was known 'Scoop' to friends and family, was rushed to St Joseph's Medical Center but couldn't be revived. Jones' mother, Thelma Martin, said she was grateful that her son is alive but heartbroken at the loss of a friend. 'It's hard, because he went to save my son, but he didn't come back with him,' she told WABC. 'And it hurts. It hurts me.' Several hundred people were reportedly at the marina when Jones fell in. The cookout was a reunion of the School Street Houses, the Yonkers apartment complex where Coleman grew up. 'He died doing God's work in front of everybody that he loved,' friend FWT said. 'So it hurts, but I feel confident knowing that he's with the Lord.' The boy was taken to St John's Riverside Hospital and is in stable condition. An autopsy on Coleman is planned for today. An investigation into the incident is ongoing. 'Unfortunately, one of the heroes became a victim himself,' Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano said at a news conference at the marina. 'My condolences to his family. We'll let the investigation unfold and see what we need to do moving forward.'

"A hero teacher managed to fend off a knife-wielding teenager with a cardboard folder after the 13-year-old went on a classroom rampage, it emerged today. The schoolboy is suspected of launching an attack on the member of staff - named only as Mr Westwood - at The Chase Technology College in Malvern yesterday, as well as a 13-year-old girl. Pupils told how the boy burst into the classroom wearing his own clothes and a scarf covering his face, with Rambo-style camouflage paint smeared under his eyes. Scroll down for video . Attack: Parents and students gathered outside the school this afternoon after the attack disrupted lessons. Many took their children home . Helicopter: West Mercia police deployed a helicopter in the hunt for the 13-year-old boy. Members of the public were been warned not to approach him . Speaking after school ended today, one said: 'People said he just ran in and went for him straight away. 'The teacher defended himself with a folder and that's when [he] ran out. I had seen him around but didn't know him. Officers today confirmed that the manhunt had ended and that he was arrested on suspicion of wounding and carrying a bladed weapon. Both victims sustained minor injuries which did not require stitches. In a statement, Superintendent Mark Travis said: 'I am very pleased to announce that earlier today, a young male we had been searching for involved with an incident at the Chase School has been found. 'He is safe and well. He has currently been arrested and has been taken to Worcester police station where we are going to be working with his family over the coming hours to provide the appropriate support and also working with the school to make sure that the school can be open tomorrow for business as usual.' Police presence: Officers guarded the school for the whole of today . Investigation: Officers are pictured above outside the school this afternoon in the wake of the attack . Eyewitnesses had reported seeing nine police cars and two dog vans outside the school as officers flooded the scene after the incident. The force helicopter was also scrambled to join the search for the young suspect and the school was initially in lock-down with pupils kept in classrooms but parents were allowed to collect their children later in the morning. One parent, whose 14-year-old daughter, attends the school said: ""When I heard there had been a suspected stabbing at the school I was horrified. The Chase Technology College, where the incident took place became an academy in November 2011 and is the largest school in Worcestershire with over 1,600 pupils. It is located in the Barnards Green suburb of Malvern, adjacent to the sites of large technology company QinetiQ and Dytecna, in the Malvern Hills Science Park. In its latest Ofsted report from February of this year, the school was rated as 'requiring improvement', despite being rated as 'good' on a previous inspection in 2011. Inspectors noted that pupil's achievement, the quality of teaching and the leadership and management needed improving, however, pupils' behaviour and safety was deemed good. 'You don't expect this sort of thing to happen in Britain, let alone a place like Malvern. It's been a nightmare getting any information from the police or the school. 'I went and collected my daughter straight away when I heard what had happened. She was not in the class where it happened but it's shaken her. 'She's been in tears and says she saw dozens of kids screaming and police everywhere.' A police description issued while the boy was on the run said he was white, about 5ft, 3 inches tall, with short spiky hair and glasses. He was seen wearing dark grey trousers, a grey hooded jumper and may have a dark scarf covering his face. He was also carrying a dark rucksack. There was also a police presence at the school throughout the afternoon. A spokesman for the college said: ''I can confirm that there was an incident this morning at school. At 8.45 am, one of our teachers and a 13-year-old female pupil both received minor injuries following an attack with a bladed instrument. 'The injuries did not require medical treatment and the assailant left the premises immediately after the incident. 'Plans were immediately implemented to ensure that all students and staff were safe. The police attended the school promptly and have assisted the school throughout the course of the day, enabling our lessons to return to normal by mid-morning. Attack: The pupil allegedly attacked another student and a teach at The Chase Technology College in Malvern . On the run: Police earlier appealed for information about the boy, and have warned others not to approach him . 'I would like to praise our students and staff for remaining calm and continuing with their education throughout today. 'The school will be open tomorrow and will continue to operate normally. Support is available at the school to support anybody that has been affected by today's earlier incident.' According to local media, the majority of pupils were taken home early.

"When this feisty couple realised they were set to become parents they had to first work out whether they would do it together or on their own. Harriet, 28, and Marti, 40, had been in an on-again off-again relationship for three years and were living apart when they discovered the big news. The couple from Newtown, in Sydney's inner west, reunited just two months prior to their little girl's birth in February and their personal experiences have been documented for a new reality television series. Scroll down for video . Harriet, 28, and Marti, 40, had been in an on-again off-again relationship for three years and were living apart when they discovered they were expecting their first daughter Katie . The ABC's Crash Test Mummies & Daddies follows five couples over the first four months of their newborn's life to capture the stress, strain and joy a baby can bring. Harriet and Marti were faced with the dramas every new parents experiences, but they had an added struggle when their daughter Katie was diagnosed with a serious thyroid problem shortly after birth. 'The biggest struggle was finding our feet as a family and trying to get our relationship back together in the midst of having a sick baby,' Harriet told Daily Mail Australia. The couple from Newtown, in Sydney's inner west, reunited just two months prior to their little girl's birth in February . Harriet said the biggest struggle when Katie was born was trying to get their relationship back on track while finding their feet as a new family . 'I certainly felt like a complete and utter failure as a mum. 'I think (Katie's diagnosis) made a difficult situation a little bit harder for us... but you have to take the good with the bad.' Katie initially struggled with sleeping at night and will now be on medication for the rest of her life as a result of her thyroid condition. 'Getting the call was a tremendous shock and gave us an incredible fright,' Marti said. 'But at our first doctor’s appointment he reassured us somewhat that it’s going to manageable. In a way we feel very lucky with Katie’s condition; it could have been a lot worse.' Harriet and Marti were faced with the dramas every new parents experiences, but they had an added struggle when their daughter Katie was diagnosed with a serious thyroid problem shortly after birth . The couple said while they thought having the television cameras around would be intrusive and stressful, it actually did wonders for their strained relationship. 'For many people young couples, it can put a lot of strain on their relationship. For us this has just solidified our relationship. It hasn’t strained our relationship,' Marti said. 'It was terrifying. I actually genuinely believed I was going to be a single mother. Going through the pregnancy alone was frightening… But I’ve come with the utmost respect for people who do it alone,' Harriet added. 'Having Katie has taught us to communicate with each other. She taught us why we liked each other in the first place. Marti, Harriet and Katie are part a new ABC reality television series called Crash Test Mummies & Daddies . 'I think having the cameras around helped us. We weren’t fighting when they were there. We had a lot of fun when they were there and they forced us to enjoy it in a way.' After a stressful first few months, the couple say the biggest piece of advice they can give any new parent would be to 'not listen to any advice'. 'Do what works – there’s no right or wrong answer. We had a very difficult baby for the first few months so we had to do what worked for us,' Harriet said. 'You should also accept all offers of help and say thank you.' The couple said while they thought having the television cameras around would be intrusive and stressful, it actually did wonders for their strained relationship . Cathrine Fowler, a professor from the Tresillian Chair in Child & Family Health, agreed that accepting people's help was beneficial. 'It’s a really important thing because we all say it, but parents often have trouble accepting the help,' Prof Fowler said. 'Write out a list of the things that need to be done, so when someone asks what I can do, there's a list of the fridge. It's really helpful for the partners who can often feel like they can never do anything right.' Cathrine Fowler, a professor from the Tresillian Chair in Child & Family Health, says it's important for new parents to accept help - a fact Harriet and Marti agreed with . Harriet and Marti said a list would have been ideal for when Katie was first born. 'I definitely had a feeling of helplessness at the start. I've only been responsible for myself and now I've got this baby and a family. There's very little as a father that you can do. I can't (breast) feed... there's a lot of things going on and you feel a bit helpless,' Marti said.

Carol Cort, 67, of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, was acquitted after her defence lawyer successfully argued that she lacked the 'mens rea' for the crime - essentially meaning she did not intend to do it. Mrs Cort had been giving the little girl a lift to the Barn Nursery School, in the Cotswold village of Bourton-on-the-Water, as a favour for her mother on February 18 last year. Carol Cort, 67, was giving the little girl a lift to the Barn Nursery School, located on this business park in Bourton-on-the-Water, as a favour for her mother . When she arrived at the nursery, she automatically picked up her handbag, locked the car and went to work - leaving the toddler, referred to only as as 'E', strapped into her car seat. Mrs Cort, who had worked in child care for 46 years, went back to her car at 3pm and drove to an after-school club to pick up other children before realising what she had done. By that time E had been trapped in the car for more than five hours, without food, water or toilet facilities. As soon as Mrs Cort realised what had happened she rushed to the child's home and tearfully confessed to the girl's mother. In today's hearing, the mother of the abandoned girl told the court: 'I just remember Mrs Cort saying she had done something really terrible and dreadful and had let all the children down. 'I think I was in shock - I don't think it registered. Mrs Cort said she had left her in the bus all day and that she had forgotten her.' The prosecution alleged Mrs Cort had been reckless in leaving the child in the locked car and therefore acted willfully. Mrs Cort offered the little girl, who has been named only as 'E' a free place at the Barn - but her mother withdrew her child from the nursery (posed by models) The defence countered this, while also obtaining an expert opinion from Dr Dilum Jayawickrama, a consultant forensic pathologist - who said Mrs Cort was suffering from 'mild to moderate' depression at the time. Dismissing the charge, District Judge Joti Bopa Rai said the Crown had not challenged this testimony with its own expert and had not shown that Mrs Cort acted 'willfully'. Upon hearing the judge's ruling, Mrs Cort hugged her daughter Alison, who was sitting next to her at Stroud Magistrates’ Court. Since the incident education watchdog Ofsted has closed down the nursery, which Mrs Cort ran with her husband Peter and daughter. Today, she chose not to comment.","Carol Cort, 67, of Gloucestershire, was giving the three-year-old girl a lift to Barn Nursery School as a favour to her mother .

"A violent mob stamped on a teenager's head and launched pumpkins at him as he lay defenseless on the ground during a vicious gang attack, new video has revealed. The shocking footage showed the teenage store clerk was brutally set upon in the parking lot outside a Kroger store in Memphis, Tennessee on Saturday. At one point, the attackers, who appear to be African-American, can be seen hurling pumpkins weighing up to 20lb at the white victim as he was being kicked and punched while lying on the ground trying to protect his head. Scroll down for video . A man in a green striped t-shirt (left) can be seen stamping on the defenseless teenager (pictured on the ground in a purple shirt)  during a vicious attack. Seconds later the victim is bombarded with heavy pumpkins (right) According to Wreg.com, a 25-year-old said he was attacked by the group as he walked to his car. When two Kroger employees aged 17 and 18 ran to help they were repeatedly punched, kicked and stamped on. Footage shows chaotic scenes unfolding on Saturday night at around 9.15pm as the mob stormed across the parking lot at Highland and Poplar. Moments later, the video shows a worker being stamped on and kicked a number of times by multiple attackers. The onslaught only ended when a security guard stepped in to stop the assault. It is understood the incident was gang related. Police later revealed that both of the teenage victims had been beaten unconscious. The website quotes Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong as calling the incident ‘troubling’ adding: ‘We are fully aware of last night’s incidents. ‘Last night’s events clearly demonstrates a lack of parental controls and if warranted these parents will also be held accountable.’ An investigation is underway.

"Parents who took their 11-year-old son out of school without permission to attend his great-grandfather's memorial service in America have had a legal case against them dropped. Essex County Council had demanded that James and Dana Haymore, from Chelmsford, pay a £120 fine for taking their son, Toby, to the service, but the parents refused. The Haymores had denied failing to ensure a child attended school regularly and were due to stand trial at Colchester Magistrates Court in November, but the council have now dropped the case. James and Dana Haymore were taken to court after refusing to pay a £120 fine for taking their son to his great-grandfather's memorial service in America . Since last September, new laws on school absences mean anyone who takes their children out of school without permission can be fined up to £2,500. The prosecution was brought after the couple took Toby out of Chancellor Park Primary School, Chelmsford, between December 16 and 20 last year and on January 7 this year for a memorial service for Mrs Haymore's grandfather in the US. The couple were expected to argue that the decision breached the European Convention of Human Rights Article 8, because it affected their right to a family life. Mrs Haymore welcomed the news, saying: 'We feel it is the right decision. No parent should have criminal charges brought against them for doing what is in the best interest of their children. 'Parents' roles are to know and love their families individually, better than any government does collectively, and make the best choices for them. 'We hope this is a step towards helping establish family rights. Essex County Council revealed that the prosecution had been discontinued after the family moved to the U.S.. Ray Gooding, cabinet member for education at the council, said: 'We have had to take a decision based on the public interest of pursuing a case where the family have emigrated and are no longer being educated in an Essex school. 'This is an unusual situation but we have chosen to be pragmatic and accept that continuing with the prosecution serves little purpose and will cost the council money. 'We take unauthorised absence very seriously and support the principle of the Government's strengthening of the rules in September 2013, which meant that term-time absence had to be authorised by head teachers and only in exceptional circumstances. 'It is extremely important to remember that in this case, the school followed the policy to the letter.' Essex County Council dropped the case against the parents because they have moved to the U.S. (file picture) Liberty, who had represented the parents, said the Haymores had been prepared to travel to the UK to clear their name. Legal director James Welch said: 'With a little helping hand from the Human Rights Act, common sense has prevailed. 'Criminalising parents for taking children out of school for important family events was hardly the best use of council resources, court time or public money. 'Heavy-handed rules like this go no way towards tackling the deeper, more complex problems that lie behind regular absence from school.' A spokesman for the school said there would be no change to its policy on non-attendance. A statement added: 'Chancellor Park Primary takes school attendance very seriously and following Government guidance only authorises term time holidays in exceptional circumstances. 'We adhered to the law in this case, passing to the local authority to progress the fines. 'The matter of dropping the legal case against Mr and Mrs Haymore is not one for the school and will not result in any change to our attendance policies.' Parents of children aged five to 16 are legally responsible for ensuring they attend school regularly - unless they are home educated. Headteachers, social workers or police can issue parents penalty notices of up to £120 if a child regularly misses school, and their parents have not taken action or asked for help. If this is not paid, a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £2,500, a three-month jail term or a community sentence. Council officials say that, aside from their education suffering, children who are often absent find it harder to sustain friendships, and are more likely to get involved with crime. Various options are available to headteachers, social workers or police including issuing parents with penalty notices between £60 and £120 if parents have not taken action or asked for help. If this is not paid, a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £2,500, a three-month jail term or a community sentence. The Government has insisted that its reforms to deal with school absence are starting to have an effect. Under the changes, truancy fines have risen from £50 to £60, and from £100 to £120 if they are not paid within 28 days. Guidance on school holidays has also changed, with headteachers now only granting permission for term time trips in 'exceptional circumstances'. Almost 64,000 fines have been handed down to parents since the law changed this time last year. Sally Randall, 35, landed herself with a criminal record after taking her son to Majorca during term-time to say goodbye to his dying grandfather. She pleaded guilty to a truancy charge when she appeared at Blackburn Magistrates' Court, Lancashire. In February Nicola Duke was one of three parents prosecuted for failing to ensure their child attends Furness Academy in Barrow, Cumbria, and was fined £500 along with £120 of other costs. And in May, a 10-year-old girl was refused time off from Hansbury Farm Primary School, Tamworth to attend her grandfather's funeral - because the reasons for her absence did not amount to 'exceptional circumstances'.","James and Dana Haymore took son, Toby, to a memorial service in the U.S.

"A former girlfriend of Australian businessman Geoffrey Edelsten has told of the lavish lifestyle she lived out as the 'arm candy' of the 71-year-old. Shirley Moore, from Chicago, started a relationship with Mr Edelsten when she was a 21-year-old waitress after meeting him on a sugar daddy website. She claims during their relationship, the Australian - who was then three times her age - gifted her with a $40,000 BMW, treated her to high-end restaurants, put her up at the Crown Melbourne hotel and gave her bundles of cash. Scroll down for video . Shirley Moore, from Chicago, has spoken out about her time as the 'arm candy' of Geoffrey Edelsten . She was 21 years old when she first met Geoffrey Edelsten and started a relationship with him . Ms Moore first met Mr Edelsten - then in 60s - when she flew to Melbourne after only seeing an old photo of him in his 40s. When an older than expected man greeted her at the airport and she thought he was his driver. But when the man gave her a hug and a kiss, she realised her mistake. 'I gave him my bags as if he was the driver...it was kind of awkward,' Ms Moore said. Ms Moore told Channel Nine's A Current Affair she had a 'verbal agreement' with Mr Edelsten about the nature of their relationship, which she says was 'purely business' and that she did not love him. She said the longer they were involved the more money she was afforded, starting at $8,000 a month or $96,000. After six months, Ms Moore's allowance grew to $150,000 and then after a year it would be $250,000. It was at the one-year mark that Ms Moore said that she and Mr Edelsten discussed marriage. Ms Moore had a relationship with Mr Edelsten before he pursued ex-wife Brynne Gordon and Gabi Grecko (pictured with him here) The 25-year-old New York model (left) went public with the 71-year-old (pictured right) in May this year . She said she would never had married him unless he gave her a lot of money, but even then her boyfriend would have to be allowed to live with them. 'I mean I would have to be fulfilled in some department,' Ms Moore said. But the talk of wedding bells halted when Ms Moore claims she discovered email exchanges between the Australian and other women. Ms Moore said she had not been faithful to Mr Edelsten during the relationship but she had not mislead him by saying she would be unlike the 71-year-old. 'I was mad at the fact that I didn't know because he kept saying about us being monogamous,' she told A Current Affair. She said she had threatened to go public with their arrangement when she found the emails, but days later she had new wheels. When asked if she thought Mr Edelsten had ever cheated on her, Ms Moore replied: 'Yeah of course. That's how I got my BMW.' She said he also set her up in a penthouse apartment in Chicago to buy her silence. Ms Moore said she contacted Gabi Grecko after Mr Edelsten referred to the New York model as a friend . She said Mr Edelsten had been in contact with her and they were going to meet up . But the relationship hit another stumbling block, Ms Moore's reluctance to go public with Mr Edelsten. Instead of joining her lover on the red carpet for the Brownlows, Ms Moore did laps around Chicago in her new set of wheels. And Mr Edelsten, she claims, was not happy. Ms Moore said he sent her abusive emails that said: 'You effin messed up my life' and how much embarrassment her no-show had caused him. It was after this incident that she was outed for another 'sugarbaby' - Brynne Gordon also known as Brynne Edelsten - who Ms Moore claims he met online and offered a $50 million proposal, including an engagement ring worth at least $250,000. Geoffrey Edelsten and Gabi Grecko went public in May when they attended AFL legend Tom Hafey's funeral . The flamboyant pair caused quite a stir after Mr Edelsten split with ex-wife Brynne Edelsten (nee Gordon) Ms Edelsten has previously denied meeting her ex-husband - who is now dating New York model Gabi Grecko - online. Ms Moore contacted Ms Grecko soon after her relationship with the businessman began when he claimed they were just friends and exchanged words. 'I emailed her: ""Who are you to Geoffrey?"",' she said. 'The first email that she sent me was: ""Go away you dumb b****. He's mine, we're getting engaged.' Ms Moore said she emailed Ms Grecko because she and Mr Edelsten had been in contact with each other and they had planned to meet up. And her parting message to Ms Grecko is: 'We're all disposable. We're all replaceable. What he can't live without is the fame, the photos, the glamour, the luxury.' But her lesson to Mr Edelsten is ever clearer: 'Karma's a bitch. She just happens to be black this time.'","Shirley Moore was a Chicago waitress when she first met the businessman .

An aerial photo taken by Helirescue showed a search team member on a jetski near a 2 metre shark off Main Beach, Byron Bay . Lawyer Mark Hickey said the victim appeared to have been swimming at the time and it is thought he was doing the popular swim from The Pass to Byron Bay. He saw what he thought was a turtle and some seaweed in the water about 20 metres away but then realised it was blood and a two metre shark circling. 'The shark came back to him and had another go. I didn’t know it was a person — but when I realised I ran out and waded to the bank and grabbed him and did CPR but it was too late. Byron Bay's beaches will remain closed for at least the next 24 hours . Shocked onlookers stood on Clarkes Beach as emergency services responded to the fatal shark attack .

Police moved a family from the water at Clarkes Beach at Byron Bay in far northern New South Wales after the incident . Lifeguards have spotted a shark in the water off the beach, believed to be a Great White . She said there was no plan to kill the shark, especially with Great Whites being a protected species . NSW Ambulance paramedic Andrew Chapman said the man was bitten above the knee. 'It was a fatal bite with major blood loss. He probably died in the water because there was no blood loss on the beach,' he told News Corp Australia. A photgrapher at the scene said that the body was taken away at around 2.30pm and that there were no family members on the beach by the afternoon. 'It was so horrible': Witnesses have told how they were yelled at to get out of the water .

He and his wife, Michelle, had gone for dip in the ocean when they were pulled from the water after the attack. The couple headed up the beach and saw the victim receiving CPR. Eventually, he saw police officers place a blanket over the man's head. 'He just looked still,' Mr Campano said. It had been the first sunny day Byron had seen in some time, he said. The man was thought to have been doing the popular ocean swim from the The Pass to Bryon Bay . The Sunshine Coast Daily reported the victim was wearing flippers and was swimming. A NSW police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia: 'A man, believed to be aged in his 40s, was in the water when he was bitten on the right leg by what is believed to be a shark. 'He was seen floating in shallow water, close to the shore line, and dragged onto the beach. An ambulance was called and he was pronounced dead a short time later. 'Inquiries into the identity of the deceased, and what he was doing in the water at the time of the incident, are continuing. 'A report is being prepared for the Coroner.'

They are due to begin their watch of the beach next week. A spokesman for NSW Ambulance said: 'A rescue helicopter and paramedics were dispatched to the scene. 'A doctor immediately treated the man on the beach but unfortunately despite clinical intervention including CPR the man has been pronounced deceased on the beach as a result of his fatal injuries.' A worker at Byron Bay Beach Cafe said: 'We can't really see anything from this part of the beach but we heard the helicopter go over. It is a nice day and we have been really busy.' A spokesman for Westpac Life Saver Rescue for the Northern Region told Daily Mail Australia: 'We were called at 10.50am with reports of a man who had been pulled out the water suffering a cardiac arrest. We were tasked but didn't actually get to the scene because the situation was too dire.' Shiney Lefai, 50, who runs Wedding Celebrant on Clarkes Beach told Daily Mail Australia: 'I was in the cafe when I heard the helicopter going overhead. I saw the paramedics and the police rushing to the scene but it was too late. It was definitely not a surfer, I think it was someone just swimming. 'It is shocking with the amount of people that have come down for holidays. This photo was taken at Clarkes Beach as surfers were evacuated from the water at 11am . The man was pulled from the water at Clarked Beach in Byron Bay . 'A shark attack is a one in a million kind of thing, it's not something that you think will happen. 'I have heard of sharks being sighted at Julian Rocks before, I have never heard of someone being killed by a shark at Byron before. 'I have lived here for over 10 years and it is the first time I have heard of it. Everyone in the town is shocked and thinking ""it could have been me"".

"Cutting it fine: Bryan Remley, 25, offered his services as a gardener at a home he allegedly burgled after he was caught by its gun-wielding owner . A burglar offered to cut the lawn in exchange for freedom after he was caught by a gun-wielding homeowner. Bryan Remley, 25, allegedly broke into a couple's home in St Petersburg, Florida, last month. But he was caught scavenging for valuables in the living room when owner Joseph Cihak, 31, got up to use the bathroom. Mr Cihak, who had been carrying a gun to the toilet, fired two shots at Remley then held him down while his wife Colleen Traversa called 911, Fox 13 reported. The burglar attempted to escape - lunging at Mr Cihak, the couple claim. He then allegedly made a final plea: he would cut their grass if they let him go. However, his offer was not enough to convince the couple who waited for police to arrive at the scene minutes later at around 5am on August 28. Mr Remley, who was allegedly carrying a small knife, was arrested and charged with armed residential burglary and violation of probation. The incident comes just weeks after a burglar in Minnesota was caught because he logged into Facebook during his heist - and forgot to log out. Authorities say Nicholas Wig burgled a home in South St. Paul on June 19 and must have decided to use the computer before he fled the property. When the owner, James Wood, arrived home and found his place had been ransacked, he reported it to police, CBS reported. Missing was cash, credit cards and a watch, but he found a pair of jeans, a belt and some Nike tennis shoes. Sometime later Mr Wood noticed a Facebook page on his computer he didn't recognize. Realizing what must have happened, he shared a picture of Wig from Wig's profile. Mr Wood announced Wig was a thief and shared his phone number, asking for anyone with information to call him. He did not expect to get a text from Wig himself in the evening. 'I replied (saying) ''you left a few things at my house last night, how can I get them back to you?''' Mr Wood said. Caught: Owner Joseph Cihak claims he held Remley down with a gun until police arrived and arrested him . Wig agreed to return to the house and pick up his things. As Mr Wood saw him approaching, he called 911. Wig was wearing Mr Wood's watch when police arrested him. 'World’s dumbest criminal,' Mr Wood said. Wig faces up to 10 years in prison and $20,000 in fines if convicted. He has an extensive criminal record, including a second-degree burglary conviction, a domestic assault misdemeanor and pending drug charges.","Bryan Remley, 25, 'broke into couple's home in St Petersburg, Florida'

"He had up to 50 confused tourists stranded outside his home each day after they blindly followed incorrect sat-nav directions. And even saw tour buses full of French schoolchildren dumped on his doorstep in a quiet cul-de-sac - a mile away from the Big Pit coalmine tourist attraction in Blaenavon, South Wales. So Nigel Winfield, 62, decided to take matters into his own hands and put up eight realistic road signs in official colours and logos to point them in the right direction. Nigel Winfield, 62, put up eight road signs to stop confused tourists from driving into his quiet cul-de-sac in Forgeside, South Wales . He believes his homemade 'tourist information' signs have led to a 90 per cent reduction in traffic in the village of Forgeside, 16 miles from Newport. He said: 'It has reached crisis point. There were around 50 cars a day coming through disrupting the peace and quiet. 'These drivers are just blindly following their sat-navs - it was a lot of traffic for a nice quiet cul-de-sac. 'It was making everyone in the street cheesed off. So, being a practical person, I decided to make some signs.' The tourists were trying to find the Big Pit coalmine tourist attraction in Blaenavon, South Wales . The signs took Mr Winfield five days to make and cost around £50 - he even made a stencil to copy the logos for sat-nav and the Big Pit. Torfaen council is currently making a new  set of signs - but  Mr Winfield's were inspected and it was decided that his could stay for now. Villagers say they have been overrun by disorientated motorists trying to make their way to the nearby museum within the industrial village Unesco World Heritage site. There are main roads which lead to the tourist attraction - but sat-navs are sending motorists 'around the houses' through the village. The in-car GPS is sending directing motorists towards an old mining road with a uneven surface and half of them turn around instead of risking it. The signs took Mr Winfield five days to make and cost around £50 - he even made a stencil to copy the logos . Sat navs  are directing tourists to Old Pit Road (pictured), next to his house, one mile away from the coal mine . 'There was instantly a ninety percent reduction - it's amazing to think a 62-year-old year old man with a paint brush and a bicycle can effect a 90 percent reduction in traffic. 'Everyone in the street was really pleased with them but I had the forger's dilema because they thought the council were responsible.' He still sees four or five drivers trying to go around the back of the houses to reach the museum - but it has been much quieter since he made his signs. A council spokesman said: 'Having carried out further investigations it seems that some sat navs do direct people incorrectly via Forgeside. 'However, this mainly appears to be an issue with older models and we are currently designing signage to try and prevent this. 'These unauthorised signs have been inspected to ensure they don't create any hazards for road users and will be removed when our own signs are erected.'","Nigel Winfield, 62, has put up eight realistic road signs near his house .

"It is the extraordinary encounter every holidaymaker wishes they could have - a close-up with a whale. These tourists managed to capture amazing footage while on a boat in Mexico, showing them petting two whales in the wild. The mother and baby are first seen approaching the boat and gently nudging it as if to say hello. And it isn't long before the holidaymakers work up the courage to touch the animals as they bob near the surface. The video, which lasts for just over one minute, was filmed by Jean-Christophe Arbonne in Laguna San Ignacio, in Baja California, earlier this year. The whales seem to enjoy the attention, rolling over and letting the tourists pet them. The adult even opens and closes its mouth, spraying the holidaymakers with water. A waterproof camera captures the majestic animals both above and below the surface of the water and shows them circling and repeatedly nudging the boat. The tourists stroke the whales as they emerge from the water beside the boat . The tourists rub the baby whale's mouth during the unexpected encounter . The whale appears to be comfortable as it edges closer to the boat and the visitors . One of the tourists can be heard saying 'wow,' before another onlooker says, 'yeah love this'. The three tourists laugh excitedly as they stroke the whales during a truly unforgettable boat ride. As if to say farewell, one of the whales can then be seen raising its head up from the water and opening its mouth.

"Adam Hills has been blasted on social media by a fellow Australian comic for 'boarding the grief train' after Hills paid his respects to the late Joan Rivers. Aussie stand-up comedienne Fiona O'Loughlin has slammed The Last Leg host for tweeting about his 'sadness' following the death of Joan Rivers, with O'Loughlin writing that 'fame is bulls***!'. Her strong reaction is a nod to Hills' notorious tirade against Joan Rivers, when he told Rivers 'F*** you!' during a heated monologue on his television show last year. Hills accused controversial Rivers of being a 'd***', in a two-minute long expletive-ridden rant about the late comedienne in retaliation to Rivers' comments about singer Adele's weight. Fearless comedienne Rivers passed away last week at the age of 81 after complications from a routine throat surgery. Scoll down for video . A still from the heated rant Adam Hills made last year on his television show, The Last Leg, in which he took the late Joan Rivers to task for being 'a d***' and a 'jaded, bitter old mole' Joan Rivers passed away last week at the age of 81, after complications during a routine throat procedure. River's passing has been met with an outpouring of grief and emotion worldwide . Hills video was shared worldwide last year, when he took offence to jokes Rivers made about Adele's weight during an interview with David Letterman. 'F*** you!' Hills yelled in retaliation, pointing down the barrel of the camera with conviction during an episode of his talk show in March 2013. 'You, Joan Rivers, have become a jaded, bitter old mole,' Hills continued. 'Get a plastic surgeon to manufacture yourself a new soul,' When new broke that Rivers was gravely ill, Hills quickly changed his tune. The Aussie, now based in England, first tweeted: . 'sending all genuine loving thoughts to @Joan_Rivers. No jokes. No dissing. Just hope she gets well soon #loveatalltimes' Upon the news of Joan's passing several days later, Hills again took to social media, expressing his sadness and paying tribute, writing that Rivers 'was a comic force of nature, and a groundbreaking performer.' Hills expressed his concern when it was announced that Joan Rivers was in an induced coma via this message on his Twitter account on August 28. The Aussie comedian again used social media to publically share his opinion of Joan Rivers. Although, this time round, Hills approach was to celebrate her contribution to comedy . Stand-up comedian O'Loughlin called Hills out on his sudden change of heart, replying publically to Hills on Twitter: . '@adamhills fame is utter bulls***! and the worst side effect of being truly funny. Do NOT! (is my advice) try 2 board this grief train.' Earlier that day, O'Loughlin had retweeted messages of grief from Melburnian comedians Kate Langbroek and Peter Helliar. Fiona O'Loughlin took to Twitter to publically try and put Adam Hills in his place, after he posted two emotional tweets about the late Joan Rivers. Adam Hills gave a raging two-minute monologue directed at Joan Rivers during his show The Last Leg last year . Aussie comedienne Fiona O'Loughlin has taken to Twitter, criticising Adam Hills for 'jumping on the grief train', considering Hills so publically slammed Joan Rivers for her behaviour and attitude last year. Adam Hills is yet to respond to O'Loughlin's comments. His tirade was made after Rivers criticised singer Adele's weight after the Brit won an Oscar. Rivers commented: 'You could easily pick Adele's Oscar statuette out of a lineup, it was the only one wearing Spanx"" and suggested the singer should change the name of one of her hit songs to Rolling In The Deep Fried Chicken. Joan Rivers funeral was held on Monday and was a celebrity-studded affair. Howard Stern made jokes about Rivers' 'private parts', Hugh Jackman sang her favourite song and her beloved daughter Melissa read a moving letter to her mother. Adam Hills' comments were made in March 2013 on his Channel 4 program, The Last Leg, during a segment in which he rants about what is annoying him in the world that week. Hills angry tirade went viral, in which he told Rivers 'f*** you' and to 'get a plastic surgeon to grow yourself a new soul' Adam Hills took offence to the comments Joan Rivers made about Brit pop star Adele, in which Rivers made jokes about Adele's weight .","Adam Hills has been blasted on Twitter by comedienne Fiona O'Loughlin .

"Louise Jerath was one of the first passengers to board the Condor flight from Manchester . A mother has told of her shock after boarding a plane with her young son and finding a blade under the seat. Louise Jerath, 44, who now lives in Mallorca, Spain, was one of the first passengers on an early morning flight from Parma to Manchester. After her seven-year-old son dropped his game on the floor, Louise bent down to search for it. But she said she was left astounded after discovering a large, double-headed blade lying on the floor under the seat in front. Ms Jerath has criticised Condor and Thomas Cook, with whom she booked the flights, for the incident, questioning how the weapon was able to get there. She said, 'I was travelling with my-seven-year-old son, we sat down but not long after he dropped his game on the floor. 'I couldn't find it immediately so I bent down and started patting around on the floor, and that's when I saw the blade - on the floor, under the seat in front. 'I picked it up and put it on the arm of my seat thinking ""what am I going to do with this?"" 'I was worried they would think I had brought it on board the flight. 'It's quite scary really, when you consider why it might have been there, or what could have happened. 'I decided to take it to a stewardess and I told her I had found it on the floor and it wasn't mine. The large double-headed blade was lying on the floor under the seat in front of Ms Jerath's seat. She had reached under to look for the game her seven-year-old son had dropped . 'She just wrapped it up in tissue and said thank you. I was expecting her to take my details, or a statement from me but she didn't.' Ms Jerath bordered the 7.55am Condor flight to Manchester, which she booked with Thomas Cook, to visit family members on 18 August. After finding the blade, the mother-of-one initially thought another passenger must have dropped it - but quickly realised no one in the vicinity had yet been seated. Ms Jerath said she immediately feared for the safety of her seven-year-old son who was flying with her at the time, as well as her own well-being. Blade find: Ms Jerath took pictures of the dangerous object to hand to the airline as evidence . Ms Jerath said, 'We go through so much security before we board the plane, I have no idea how anyone would be able to get a blade through. 'I was so glad my son didn't pick it up - it's so concerning to think anyone could have got their hands on it. 'It makes you wonder - that blade could have been put there for someone else to pick up on purpose.' After picking up the dangerous object, Louise immediately took some pictures, to hand to the airline as evidence. She then informed cabin crew members who wrapped the blade in a tissue before disposing of it. Ms Jerath had booked her flight through Thomas Cook and was on her way to visit family members . Ms Jerath claims they failed to take her seriously and have since neglected to look into her allegations. She said, 'When I picked it up there was no one sat next to, in front, or behind me, so it must have been there before we boarded.' A spokesman for Thomas Cook and Condor apologised for the incident and said it was being looked into. He said, 'We'd like to reiterate our thanks to our customer for bringing this to our attention on boarding the aircraft. 'All our aircrafts are cleaned and inspected prior to each flight so we are now working with Condor, our sister airline, to investigate how - on this rare occasion - a small blade was found on board.'","Louise Jerath was travelling to Manchester with her seven-year-old son .

"A 47-year-old  caretaker obsessed  throwing extravagant parties has just become the coolest kid in school - by building a giant pirate ship in his back garden. Tim Jones can now make troublesome guests walk the plank on his 25ft creation - which he built himself and takes up half of his garden. He has been throwing themed birthday parties for years - he has treated friends to a Medieval banquet, Mexican barbecue and 1940s-style ball in the past. Whittle me timbers! School caretaker Tim Jones has built a 25ft long pirate ship in his back garden . Eccentric: Mr Jones (left) has always loved pirate ships, and spent six months on his creation . But this year he has really had to put all hands on deck. The huge ship comes complete with rigging, a classic Jolly Rodger and a 25ft high mast, and took six months to complete. Incredibly, it even boasts a cannon, though neighbours will be very glad to know that it is not the real thing. Mr Jones, from Felixstowe, Suffolk, said: 'I have always loved pirates since I was a kid and then the Pirates of the Caribbean movies came out and it brought it all alive. Monstrous: The ship's mast is made from a telegraph pole and is 25ft high, complete with sheets and rigging . 'I have had loads of themed parties but it seemed pirates was the one everybody loved the most. 'I started putting the odd bit in last summer then it just grew and grew. I got the telegraph pole for the mast then it sort of got out of hand. 'Most of the stuff was just unwanted and school donated loads of fence panels. I really didn't spend that much money on it. 'My friends and their kids love it. It is a good way to get everybody up and involved when I have a party. Watch out below! The land locked boat even boasts a pretend cannon which points out the back . It's party time! Mr Jones' friends enjoy his months of hard work as they play around in the ship . 'They all enjoy running around it, but I think I'm the biggest kid of all.' Mr Jones' girlfriend has two children, who love playing on the ship, and the caretaker would like to make it even bigger. Unfortunately that will not be possible however, as the firmly moored boat is already taking up too much space. The floor of the ship has been covered in decking while standard fence panels have been erected to give it its shape. Just like the real thing: Mr Jones has pulled out all the stops, adding a skeleton and lights for night time . A captain's cabin comes complete with a bench, wooden chest and a chiminea, while fish netting adorns the boat's walls. The 25ft telegraph pole acts as the central mast while bed sheets and rope make up the vessel's sails. And the whole thing is topped off, of course, with a creepy skeleton and a chirpy model parrot. It is  about 25ft long and 15ft wide and has become somewhat of a talking point with pupils at the nearby Felixstowe Academy, where he works. Mr Jones said: 'You can see it from the road, there's a big flag flying and the mast - it's quite a sight. 'They walk past it every day and you can hear them laughing and joking.","Tim Jones, 47, spent six months building the intricate structure .

Lording it over: The Islamic State force trying to capture the dam was wiped out with the help of U.S. air strikes that widened what Barack Obama called a campaign to ultimately defeat the jihadist movement . It came after an attack by ISIS on a military post during the visit of Ahmed al-Dulaimi, the governor of Iraq's Anbar province, amid running gun battles for control of the Haditha Dam. Dulaimi was injured during the attack, which also wounded Abdulhakim al-Jughaifi, the administrative official responsible for Haditha, and seven soldiers, shortly after the town of Barwanah was retaken from militants. A suicide bomber then struck the convoy carrying Dulaimi toward Haditha for treatment, killing one soldier and wounding six others. Governor Ahmed al-Dulaimi later tweeted that he was not seriously hurt.

The . study by the London-based small-arms research organisation Conflict . Armament Research documented weapons seized by Kurdish forces from . militants in Iraq and Syria over a 10-day period in July. The . report said the jihadists disposed of 'significant quantities' of . U.S.-made small arms including M16 assault rifles and included photos . showing the markings 'Property of US Govt'. It . also found that anti-tank rockets used by IS in Syria were 'identical . to M79 rockets transferred by Saudi Arabia to forces operating under the . Free Syrian Army umbrella in 2013'. The rockets were made in the then Yugoslavia in the 1980s. Islamic . State is believed to have seized large quantities of weapons from . Syrian military installations it has captured as well as arms supplied . by the United States to the Iraqi army after it swept through northern . Iraq in recent weeks. The militants could have opened or . damaged the dam, flooding wide areas as far as Baghdad's international . airport, where hundreds of US personnel are stationed, national security . council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. US defence secretary Chuck Hagel, travelling in Georgia, said the Iraqi government had asked the U.S. to launch the airstrikes. The six-month-old battle for control . of the Haditha Dam has been a rare case of co-operation between local . Sunni tribes and the Shi'ite-led Iraqi military. The . Juhayfa tribe in Haditha has a long-standing fight with the Islamic . State, which split with its parent organization Al Qaeda last year. Anbar is complicated terrain for the . Americans as they seek to root out Islamic State, since Sunnis fighting . on behalf of the Baghdad government are the exception to the rule. The . large desert province, bordering Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, has . been at war with Baghdad since last December when then-Prime Minister . Nuri al-Maliki sent troops to raze an anti-government demonstrators' camp. That sparked a tribal revolt against Maliki whom Sunnis accused of isolating them with indiscriminate arrests. Islamic State fighters took advantage of the chaos to muscle in and become the dominant force among Sunnis. The . fighting there, which has displaced 430,000 people since January, . strengthened the Islamic State ahead of its lightning blitz this summer . across the north of Iraq, also threatening the semi-autonomous, . Western-backed enclave of Kurdistan. Injured in battle: A member of Iraqi security forces, backed by Sunni tribesmen, gives assistance to comrades who were wounded during the attack . Location: U.S. warplanes have launched five air strikes on Islamic State militants trying to capture Haditha Dam . Meanwhile, . the head of the Arab League has urged its members to confront Islamic . State extremists 'militarily and politically'. The . apparent call to arms came as President Barack Obama prepares to go to . politicians and the American public with his own plan to stop the . militants. Backing from the 22-country Arab League could provide crucial support across the Middle East for Mr Obama's effort to assemble an international coalition against IS, the marauding group that has conquered large parts of Iraq and Syria and committed beheadings and mass killings to sow terror. Nato forces have already agreed to take on the extremists. Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby said what is needed from Arab countries is a 'clear and firm decision for a comprehensive confrontation' with 'cancerous and terrorist' groups. The Arab League includes Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Mr Obama will meet congressional leaders tomorrow and then outline his plan to the war-weary American public on Wednesday, the eve of the 13th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. 'I just want the American people to understand the nature of the threat and how we're going to deal with it and to have confidence that we'll be able to deal with it,' the president said.","Militants died during attack on an Iraqi military post near Haditha Dam .

"Lexi Branson (pictured) was killed when the Aylestone-Bulldog pet suddenly attacked her in 2013 . A pet bulldog mauled a four-year-old girl to death as her mother tried desperately to beat it off with her hands and a knife. Jodi Hudson told yesterday how she hit the dog as its jaws gripped the throat of her daughter Lexi Branson. She then went to get ‘the biggest knife I could find’ and repeatedly stabbed the crazed animal, which she had taken in only weeks earlier without knowing it had six previous owners and a history of violence, an inquest heard. She eventually managed to stab the dog to death and carry Lexi from the two-bedroom flat. Miss Hudson, 31, said she tried to revive her daughter before paramedics – alerted by a neighbour who had heard screaming – arrived. Lexi was taken to hospital but died. Miss Hudson told the coroner that she paid £50 to a rehoming centre last October for the Aylestone bulldog – which she named Mulan after the Disney heroine. It had been advertised as ‘better suited to a home without young children’. But when she asked kennel staff about this, she was told only the dog had a ‘tendency to jump up’ and could knock children over because of its size. However, Mulan had six owners before being taken in by Willow Tree rehousing centre in Barrow-upon-Soar, Leicestershire, in August 2013, the inquest at Loughborough heard. The last of these called a warden claiming to have found the dog, thought to be aged between six and eight, wandering in a park near his home. Police, said the man, who was not identified, had owned Mulan for only a matter of hours when it attacked his other dog. He feared it could savage his young children. Detective Sergeant Kenny Henry of Leicestershire Police told the inquest the man had lied about finding the animal because ‘you have to pay to hand a dog in’. It meant that kennel staff had no idea about the dog’s background. The dog warden, Jodie Barlow, said Mulan ‘seemed like a yard dog or guard dog’ and ‘didn’t seem like a family pet’. In her notes to the rehoming centre, she said the dog had marks on its face which suggested it had been fighting. The inquest also heard that the manager of a rescue centre for Aylestone bulldogs visited the rehoming centre with a view to taking on Mulan, but decide not to as he believed the dog was an Aylestone cross. At the time of the incident, police described the animal as a bulldog, and said they were working to establish the exact breed. Mulan had been microchipped by its first owner but, when traced by the centre, he said he did not want the dog back. Unknown to the staff at the kennels from where he was collected, the bulldog named Mulan (pictured) had gone through the hands of several owners and had acted aggressively  before . Ms Hudson pictured today outside Rutland and North Leicestershire Coroner's Court . A young Willow Tree worker, who had no formal training in the assessment or behaviour of dogs, judged Mulan to be ‘laid back and placid’ and suitable for rehoming. The inquest heard that the centre’s only procedure for checking whether new owners were suitable was the completion of a form. Staff were not required to visit homes before placing an animal. Miss Hudson said Mulan had shown ‘no signs of aggression at all’ and allowed itself to be cuddled by Lexi. On November 5, the girl was off school sick and watching TV in the lounge at the flat in Mountsorrel, near Loughborough, when the fatal attack occurred. Miss Hudson, a single parent, said Mulan ‘went stiff’. She added: ‘The dog went on all fours and stared at Lexi. I said, “No Mulan”, and tapped her and that’s when she went for Lexi. The funeral for four-year-old Lexi was held in November last year. Pictured is the procession leaving the Holy Trinity Church in Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire (left), followed by Lexi's mother Jodi Hudson (right) She went straight for her throat and then around to her mouth.’ Lexi was knocked to the floor as Miss Hudson struggled with Mulan, trying to prise open its jaws before grabbing the knife. Asked by Trevor Kirkman, senior coroner for Rutland and North Leicestershire, whether stabbing the animal was immediately successful in halting its attack, Miss Hudson replied: ‘No... It seemed like an eternity.’ A post-mortem found Lexi died from extensive injuries to her face and neck, which obstructed her airway, preventing her from breathing. The inquest continues. Tributes were left near the scene where Lexi was killed in the days following the attack (pictured) Pathologist Dr Roger Malcolmson told the court Lexi had died of facial injuries and external airway obstruction. He said: 'She had extensive injuries to both her face and neck area which would be concurrent with being attacked by a dog. 'She had slight injuries to her hands showing she had tried to fight back and had not died instantly. 'Her injuries were consistent with an external obstruction to her airways.'

"Virginia police say a 53-year-old man has been indicted on murder charges in three shocking slayings that spread fear through a quiet neighborhood in Alexandria for almost 11 years. Authorities announced on Monday the grand jury indictment of Charles Severance, who is in jail in Loudoun County awaiting trial on a gun possession charge. The indictment contains ten charges, including two charges of capital murder and one charge of first-degree murder in the deaths of Ruthanne Lodato, Ronald Kirby and Nancy Dunning. Charles Severance, shown here speaking with his attorney during a court proceeding in March, was indicted on ten charges tied to the slaying of three people in Alexandria over the past 11 years . Alexandria Police Chief Earl L. Cook discussed the indictment with reporters on Monday, saying he was confident Severance was the man behind the grisly murders . 'I am confident that the suspect Charles Severance is the suspect we have been looking for, which is now almost 11 years,' Alexandria Police Chief Earl Cook said during a press conference today. 'This case is another example of Alexandria's commitment to bring people to justice.' Alexandria Commonwealth's Attorney Bryan Porter said he doesn't intend to seek the death penalty, the Washington Post reported. The maximum sentence Severance could face if convicted is life in prison. Pictured are the three murder victims, Ronald Kirby, Nancy Dunning and Ruthanne Lodato, who was killed in February . Charles Severance's parents, Virginia and Laverne, center, look on during their son's extradition hearing at the Ohio County Circuit Court in April . The first death Severance is charged with, that of Dunning, wife of then-Alexandria Sheriff Jim Dunning, occurred in December 2003. The second came almost ten years later, in November 2013, when 69-year-old Kirby, an official with the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, was slain. The most recent of the three murders occurred in February when music teacher Lodato was killed in her home. Cook speaks with Patty Moran, sister of Nancy Dunning, following the news conference in Alexandria, Virginia . Severance was arrested in West Virginia on a charge of gun possession and was later extradited to Virginia . All three were killed in their homes or at their doorways during daylight hours. A caretaker who survived the February attack helped police create a sketch of the killer, one of a series of breaks that apparently led led police to declare they believed the cases were linked. Severance was indicted on the following charges involving the killings of Nancy Dunning, Ron Kirby and Ruthanne Lodato: . The clues also led local police, with the help of Virginia State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, to Severance. The eccentric Civil War eccentric who ran for mayor of Alexandria twice had been living with his girlfriend in Loudoun, according to the Post. After police contacted him, he left the state. He was eventually arrested in Wheeling, West Virginia, on gun charges and expedited to Virginia. As a convicted felon, Severance is not allowed to possess firearms. Severance's lawyer had argued that the weapons charge was a sham' intended to give Alexandria authorities more time for their murder investigation. Police had been reluctant to publicly link Severance to the killings. But the investigation became 'very intensive' over the past five months, Cook said. 'We were motivated to find justice for victims and closure for the families,' he said. 'This is a very emotional crime. This is a very personal crime.'","Charles Severance was indicted on ten charges tied to three high-profile killings in  Alexandria, Virginia, beginning in 2003 .

The Australian government has released an updated map showing the new, smaller search area for MH370 . Over . the past six months, international experts searched for the aircraft . using a range of data in a bid to narrow down the crash site. Mr Dolan told the Telegraph that a 'reasonably clear picture' of . the plane's trajectory was emerging, even if there were . still approximately 1,000 possible paths it could have taken. He said: 'There is an infinite possible number of tracks that . the aircraft could have flown along, but for practical purposes there . are about 1,000... from the point of its turning south.' Extensive . aerial searches failed to spot any wreckage from the airliner, but . experts have studied radar and satellite data in a bid to close in on . the crash site. Mr Dolan . said new seabed surveys have also produced some interesting findings . including hard objects that seem inconsistent with their surroundings, . although there is no guarantee that this is the aircraft. He told The Times: ' There is nothing that has screamed out and said ""I look like an aircraft"". 'It's still a hell of an area. The area is horribly, horribly complicated.' Experts have spent the past six months remapping large areas of the sea floor to facilitate the search . Australian deputy PM Warren Truss, right, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Malaysian transport minister Dato' Seri Liow Tiong Lai in Canberra to agree to fund the renewed search . Mr Dolan earlier wrote on his blog that the new search will concentrate on a 60,000 square kilometre area of the southern Indian Ocean. 'The complexities surrounding the search cannot be understated. It involves vast areas of the Indian Ocean with only limited known data and aircraft flight information. 'While it is impossible to determine with certainty where the aircraft may have entered the water, all the available data indicates a highly probable search area close to a long but narrow arc of the southern Indian Ocean. 'The search will be a major undertaking. The complexities and challenges involved are immense, but not impossible. 'The best minds from around the world have been reviewing, refining and localising the most likely area where the aircraft entered the water, which is why we remain confident of finding the aircraft.' Last month the Malaysian and Australian governments signed a memorandum of understanding where they both agreed to fund the renewed search effort.","Experts warn 'infinite number of tracks aircraft could've flown along'

"Panic attacks: Martha Sangster, a 21-year-old student, had a history of asthma . A university student died from a severe bout of asthma after telling doctors she was having panic attacks over exams and coursework, an inquest heard. Martha Sangster, 21, was found dead after a severe asthma attack at her student home in Lancaster, where she was studying at the University of Cumbria. In the months before her death Miss Sangster, who had a history of asthma, had told medics that her impending exams and coursework were giving her anxiety attacks. She was found on a Monday morning last January after she didn't turn up for lectures that morning. Tests showed she had hyperinflated lungs - a symptom which suggests she was struggling to breathe at the time of her death. The inquest in Preston was told Miss Sangster, Bradford, West Yorkshire, had a history of asthma and epilepsy. She had been prescribed epilepsy drugs and had been given two inhalers to deal with her conditions. At first Miss Sangster believed her attacks were triggered by exercise, cold weather, cats and hayfever. But last summer she began experiencing panic attacks and anxiety in the run-up to coursework deadlines and her final exams. Speaking at the inquest, Dr Juliette McGrattan said Miss Sangster told her she had had an 'odd episode' on holiday in the U.S. She said: 'She told me she had been sharing a room and her roommate commented that she had acted strangely. She was lying on her side and not responding properly. 'I asked if she thought it was a seizure and she said she didn't think it was a seizure. She thought it was a panic attack. 'I asked if she could be sure and she said if she had a seizure in the past she felt very sick after and hadn't felt nauseous. I remember feeling uncertain and writing to monitor carefully. This was two months after she had the episode and I told her to come back if anything similar occurred. Scroll down for video . Inquest: The hearing into Martha's death in Preston concluded she died of natural causes. She is pictured above on holiday at the Hoover Dam in the U.S. 'I tried to explore it, I said please come back if something like that happens again. I told her she needed to book in an asthma review with the nurse. It is something we struggle with if people think their asthma is well-controlled. 'As far as I'm aware no appointment was booked.' Another doctor, Anna Kalougin, told the inquest Miss Sangster came to see her last December because she had been panicking about coursework deadlines, and asked for a medical note. Night out: Friends of Miss Sangster told how a few days before her death they had been partying in Lancaster - but that she seemed fine the day afterwards . She was prescribed an anti-nausea tablet to dissolve under her tongue. The fatal attack struck after Miss Sangster went on a night out with university friends in Lancaster. Kathryn Pawson, part of the group that night, told the inquest how they had stayed out until 4am on the Saturday morning and had bought a takeaway on their way back to a friend's house. Recommendation: One doctor said that she had advised Miss Sangster to book a follow-up appointment about her astham, but that it did not take place . Miss Pawson said: 'She decided that she was going to walk home. We said to stay at the friend's but one of the boys walked her home because she wanted to go home. She was fine, she was quite happy, quite normal, not the worse for drink. 'I rang her about 1.30pm that day to see how she was. I asked how she was and she said about the fact that to say she had been out she wasn't feeling that bad. 'Normally she would say she feels rough and hungover. She said she didn't feel that bad but wanted to just stay in bed and chill and watch films. Student: Miss Sangster studied sports science at the University of Cumbria (pictured) 'I tried to get in touch on Sunday and sent her a text to see if she was coming over. I didn't get a reply but because we had lectures the next day I thought she would come to mine after.'

"Political opposites turned friends, former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush launched a new scholars program at four presidential centers with an opening act that might have been mistaken for a comedy routine. The two former presidents - one a Democrat, the other a Republican - shared laughs and a buddy-like banter on stage Monday, talking about presidential leadership while trading stories about their famous families and life after the White House. Bill Clinton said he and Bush laughed backstage about people coming up to them at restaurants and asking to take 'selfie' photos. Quipped Bush: 'At least they're still asking.' In stitches: Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush appeared together Monday, to announce a leadership series which will be taught at four presidential libraries across the nation . Flattery: The two kept the talk light, avoiding any tangent into current President Barack Obama's issues with ISIS. Instead, they spent much of the time complimenting each other . The new autograph: Clinton and Bush also reflected on what it's like to be a former president today, like being asked in restaurants to take selfies with strangers . With Hillary Rodham Clinton seated in the fourth row, Bush noted that many people ask him about the possibility of another Bush-Clinton White House campaign. His father, President George H.W. Bush, lost to Clinton in 1992, and his brother, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, may seek the GOP nomination in a race that could pair him against Hillary Clinton. 'The first one didn't turn out too good,' Bush quipped. The 42nd and 43rd presidents joined together to announce the Presidential Leadership Scholars program, a partnership between the Clinton, Bush, George H.W. Bush and Lyndon B. Johnson presidential centers. Future Madam President? Hillary Clinton attended the event at the Newseum to hear her husband and former President Bush speak. The two former presidents dodged the question of Hillary's potential 2016 run at the White House . At a time of partisanship and gridlock, both presidents said they hoped the scholars program would attract people in business, public service and the military interested in learning about presidential decision-making and applying it to their own careers. Clinton revealed that he and Bush would speak twice a year during Bush's second term, 30-to-45 minute conversations about policy and politics. While they didn't always agree, Clinton said he never talked about their discussions and said the talks 'meant a lot to me.' Clinton said the test of any democracy is finding ways of having a vigorous debate and still reaching resolution to the nation's problems. 'If you read the Constitution, it ought to be subtitled: ""Let's make a deal,""' Clinton said. Confidante: It was revealed during the talk that Bush called Clinton twice a year, during the second half of his presidency, to discuss the world for 30-45 minutes. He says the chats 'meant a lot to me'. Bush Sr: The two also spoke at length about Bush's father, former President George H.W. Bush, praising the elder Bush who Clinton beat in the 1992 election . The elder Bush got in the act from afar, writing in a letter read aloud that every former president displays different qualities, 'for example, not all of us skydive.' Bush, who celebrated his 90th birthday in June by making a tandem parachute jump, urged the two former presidents to 'keep it brief.' The event had a light-hearted tone. Bush offered Clinton advice on becoming a grandparent - Clinton's daughter Chelsea is expecting her first child this fall. 'Get ready ... to be like the lowest person in the pecking order in your family,'Bush said. At one point, Clinton's cellphone rang on stage, prompting him to tell the audience that 'only two people have this number and they are related to me.' The best of friends: Despite being political opposites, Clinton and Bush have forged perhaps the closest relationship between any two former presidents . Like family: Clinton has previously referred to Bush as his 'brother from another mother' and the 'black sheep son' of the Bush family . Clinton said he hoped 'I'm not being told I'm about to become a premature grandfather.' Assessing each other's leadership qualities, Clinton said Bush did things he thought was right and 'consistently benefited by being underestimated - and so did I for totally different reasons.' Bush said Clinton was empathetic and 'an awesome communicator' who could 'really lay out a case and get people all across the political spectrum.' Ending his comments, he asked Clinton: 'Is that enough?' Proud: Bush also gave Clinton some advice on being a grandparent, since daughter Chelsea Clinton is expecting her first child. Bush pictured above with his granddaughter Mia . Going to be a grandpa! Former President Clinton is preparing for his next job as grandfather, as daughter Chelsea is expecting her first child. Pictured above with her husband Marc Mezvinsky in New York on September 3 . George W. Bush campaigned for president in 2000 on restoring 'honor and dignity' to the White House following Clinton's impeachment over a sex scandal. But the two former presidents have developed a bond, strengthened by their mutual admiration for the elder Bush, whom Clinton visited in Maine last week. Clinton and the younger Bush worked together on relief efforts after Haiti's devastating earthquake in 2010 and have been active in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Africa. Bush noted that his upcoming book, called '41: A Portrait of My Father,' would be a 'love story. It's a story about seeing someone you admire and learning from them.' As moderator Josh Bolten humorously plugged the book's November 11 release date, Clinton mused about writing his own competing Bush 41 book. 'I think I can put one together that would be ready to go,' Clinton joked.","The former presidents appeared together Monday at an event at the Newseum in Washington, DC .

"Education Minister Christopher Pyne has denied that he ever offered a job or legal representation to James Ashby, a former staff member of speaker Peter Slipper. 'Sometimes people misinterpret conversations that are made and that are held,' Mr Pyne said. 'I had three meetings with Mr Ashby, the first was when I met him in Peter Slipper's office very briefly. 'The second was when I shared a drink with him, and another staffer, while I was waiting for Peter Slipper to come back from the adjournment debate when he was the speaker ..and the third was when he came to collect a couple of bottles of wine,' Mr Pyne added. Scroll down for video . To the question of whether a lawyer was offered to James Ashby (left), Christopher Pyrne (right) replied: 'That was not my intention, no.' My Pyne added that 'I stand by all the statements I have made previously over the last 2 and a half years'. James Ashby was a former staff member in the office of ex-Speaker of the House, Peter Slipper. He took legal action against Mr Slipper, including allegations of sexual harrassment.

However, during the 60 Minutes interview, Mr Ashby said in his conversation with Christopher Pyne, that he had been offered the services of a lawyer and promised a job could always be found for him.

'I had a brief meeting, we discussed the fact the Queensland state election was coming very soon, he indicated he was uncomfortable in Mr Slipper's office and I indicated to him that if we won the Queensland state election that would be a chance potentially for him to get out of Mr Slipper's office but the fact is there was no job ever provided for Mr Ashby,' Mr Pyne said. 'My intention was never to lead him to believe that a job would be provided to him but obviously if we won the Queensland state election and then subsequently the federal election, when you are in government there are a lot more jobs available than when you are in opposition and that if he felt uncomfortable in Mr Slipper's office, that would be an opportunity for him to get out of the office.'

'I think Mr Abbott needs to come clean about his own involvement in what he knew, and in particular Christopher Pyne has serious questions to answer,' Mr Dreyfus said. Mr Pyne also added that 'I thought he was very courageous last night in telling his story - he came across as a very decent person who wants to put that unhappy period behind him.'

"A former child star, who was a child sex abuse victim, has spoken out about life, after her abuser was sentenced to jail. Sarah Monahan, known as Jenny Kelly on popular Australian TV show, Hey Dad, played the daughter of disgraced actor Robert Hughes and was one of his child sex abuse victims. The 36 year old was the whistleblower, who sparked an investigation against Mr Hughes, claiming she was sexually assaulted on the set of Hey Dad between 1987 and 1994, by on-screen father, Mr Hughes. Scroll down for video . Sarah Monahan (pictured far right) with Hey Dad crew including Robert Hughes (pictured left of Monahan) who was her child sex abuser. She has spoken out after Hughes was found guilty and was sentenced to jail . Sarah Monahan (pictured) former child star of popular Aussie TV show Hey Dad, says its still hard to move on despite her abuser, Robert Hughes', conviction. Since 2010, she has been a Braveheart ambassador, a sexual assault advocacy group . During an interview on A Current Affair in 2011, Monahan said that she intended to initiate legal actions against Hughes and television executives who, she claimed, were aware of Hughes' alleged actions and failed to take action. Robert Hughes was arrested in London on 9 August 2012. He was extradited to Australia and in early April 2014 was found guilty of 10 child sex charges and was sentenced to a maximum of 10 years and nine months jail. Monahan has told News.com.au there are still people working in the Australian television industry who are perpetrators of child sexual abuse. She's refused to go into any details or names but has given a scathing assessment of the entertainment industry's treatment of children. 'The industry doesn't care about kids. It's like child labour,' she said. Ms Monahan has been an ambassador for Braveheart, a sexual assault advocacy group, since 2010. Sarah Monahan is a Braveheart ambassador  and is helping to support their latest campaign, encouraging people to take a selfie answering the queestion #whoRUprotecting written on their hand and posting on social media . Braveheart's #whoRUprotecting campaign (part of national child protection week) To support the cause people are being encouraged to take a selfie answering the question #whoRUprotecting written on their hand and post it to social media . She has taken this week's, National child protection week, to speak out about child sex abuse and about her own story, which she says doesn't get any easier despite her abuser being found guilty and jailed. 'People kind of expected that once [Hughes] went to jail, that’s it and you move on,' she told News.com.au. 'You kind of do on some days and on other days you don’t. People expect me to say, ‘Good job, he’s in jail now’. But it really doesn’t work that way.' While Ms Monahan has received a tidal wave of support since going public with her abuse, she's had to fend off accusations she did it for self promotion. On her blog last month she posted her anger with suggestions that people who come out with abuse are just in it for the money and fame. 'I don’t think people grasp the concept that not everyone wants to be famous. Not everyone is looking for that 15 minutes,' she said. 'Some people just want to be heard. They want justice. They want to right a few wrongs.'

'Everytime I see a new person who is being investigated, for just a minute, I’m so happy that others are following in my footsteps, and are taking on the high profile untouchables. But that joy doesn’t last very long, because it only takes a few minutes for the doubters to come out.' Ms Monahan told of how she spoke to several other former kid actors over in the US, where she now has been living for over a decade, who have also been through abuse. 'Some spoke up, some didn’t. They all know how terribly hard it is to live with, being judged. Every little thing you say will be over analyzed, picked apart, recorded, and then, if you’re lucky enough to make it to court, it can and will be used against you,' she said on her blog. The 36 year old hopes that in time more abuse victims will come forward to tell their story and has put her support behind a new social media campaign, creating awareness. Bravehearts are encouraging people to take a selfie answering the question #whoRUprotecting and write the answer on their hand and share it on social media. A number of celebrities have shown their support including a list of NRL stars and officials, Queensland premier Campbell Newman, Commando and a number of high profiled TV hosts.

Like the traditional tinned variety, Proper Beans can be heated up on the hob or in the microwave. But there the similarities stop. Two of the exotic new beans being sold by Fortnum and Mason . Unlike their tinned cousins, Proper Beans have to be kept in the fridge and are available in four (not 57) varieties, including British Fava Beans And Smoked Pork Collar, and Ham Hock, Potato And Thyme. The range is the brainchild of 33-year-old Londoner Ben Mason. ‘Some people said, “You’re completely crazy,”’ he says. ‘Most people think that beans can’t change.’ The Proper beans range goes on sale in Fortnum & Mason at £3.95 a tub . But he is hoping for a case of history repeating itself. It was in Fortnum’s Piccadilly store that another young entrepreneur, Henry Heinz from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, introduced the baked bean to Britain in 1886 marketed as an expensive foreign delicacy.","New tastes include British Fava Beans And Smoked Pork Collar, and Ham Hock, Potato And Thyme .

"Plumbing disasters in South Australia has been exposed by an association who claim such 'predatory practices' can potentially put homeowners' lives at risk. This has prompted the plumbing industry to hold a crisis meeting this month with the state consumer watchdog. Various examples of 'bad plumbing' were revealed in this month's edition of the Plumbing Industry Association of South Australia magazine and The Advertiser, including a bathroom sink which empties into a toilet bowl and a witches hat throne. Bad plumbing in South Australia is a growing concern and can potentially put homeowners' lives at risk, a plumbing association claims . An exposed copper gas pipe instead of being installed at least 300mm underground . The association's membership manager Paul Worthington says the poor quality of work undermines the industry's integrity whilst it can also be costly and deadly for consumers. 'There are predatory practices where customers are being ripped off as plumbers are taking short cuts to save money,' Mr Worthington told Daily Mail Australia. 'The SARS outbreak was a direct result of poor plumbing - so that's the kind of potential we're facing here.' He gave a number of examples including a photo of an exposed copper gas pipe, which is supposed to be installed at least 300mm underground, and a bathroom sink which empties into a toilet bowl. More examples of illegal and dangerous work practices . It's a far reach to from the toilet to the toilet paper dispenser . A plumber installs a tap that doesn't quite reach the bathroom sink . A potential solution to a toilet bowl obstructing the bathroom door . Poorly designer plumbing shows no leg room in a bathroom . The Advertiser also published images of other examples of shoddy plumbing such as a witches hat toilet, a tap which doesn't quite reach the sink and a bathroom with no leg room. Mr Worthington says he was made aware of the diminishing standards nine years ago, when he first surveyed association members. He has since been lobbying for this issue and says the scheduled meeting with Commissioner for Consumer Affairs Dini Soulio is long overdue. 'We found that 75 per cent of our members wanted better policing of work practices and the feedback is still overwhelming,' he said. 'The standards and regulations do exist but they need to be enforced in a methodical way that will keep plumbers on their toes. 'Ever since the self-regulation system came into place about 10 to 15 years ago, the quality of work has deteriorated.' Mr Worthington says the decline in plumbing income, increasing material costs and lacking number of inspectors have all played a part in the reduced standards. 'There's huge pressure to get the job but this just isn't good enough and it's exposing people to unnecessary risks,' he said. 'We shouldn't be worried about these kind of building practices in a first world country.' This month's meeting will see the state's key stakeholders, which include the housing industry, master builders, plumbing and electrical associations, highlight the failings of the industry. Daily Mail Australia is waiting a response from the Commissioner.","Growing 'predatory practices' in South Australia's construction industry may put lives at risk, a plumbing association claims .

"Jacky Lo posted pics of his dog being washed in a washing machine cycle on his Facebook page . Distressing images of a puppy dog almost drowning in a washing machine cycle has sparked outrage in Hong Kong . A teenage boy, named Jacky Lo, posted the shocking pictures of the small dog struggling in the churning water on his Facebook page with a comment boasting about how efficient the method had been to clean his pet. He then went on to joke that the cute canine, believed to be a white West Highland terrier, had not survived the terrifying incident but one of photos showed the dog made it through the wash cycle – albeit sopping wet and stunned. The brazen images have led to an online petition and a police investigation into the incident. Lo wrote the following comment when posting the pictures: 'A super quick way to wash a dog: soak, clean, and dry. All done. Clean and quick!' with a smiley icon and the words 'feeling content' reports South China Morning Post. When someone  asked if the pup had died, Lo replied with: 'Yes, wanna see it?' An online petition was started on the You Sign Animals website which saw 19,000 people putting their name to the cause which called on authorities to investigate the matter. 'Although Hong Kong might not be known for its animal welfare laws, this is just unacceptable,' the site said. 'Authorities cannot turn a blind eye on this. Let's convince authorities they need to look into it and have this man brought to justice.' Pics of the poor pet submerged in water over its head as the wash cycle churns . The white West Highland terrier frantically trying to scramble out of the machine . Lo's Facebook profile has since been taken down but the petition page revealed more of the conversation Lo had with people about the picture he posted. A Facebook user, named Agnes replied, that this was one way for Lo to get famous and then asked if he did not perceive the stunt as an act of animal cruelty. 'I don't care what you guys are going to do! Do I look afraid of you guys?' Lo posted. 'I don't even think animal cruelty is a problem, not to mention cats and dogs!' His comments started a tirade of abuse towards Lo from social media users who labelled him 'sick', 'scum', 'a weak bully', 'shameless' and 'a monster'. Authorities have since stepped in to investigate the matter but Lo gloated on Saturday that he was leaving Hong Kong to go back to the mainland, the South China Morning Post reported. The post included a link to the online petition urging the police to bring him to justice, with Lo commenting: 'Wanted?? This afternoon I'm going back to China. See ya later.' SPCA spokeswoman Rebecca Ngan said people began contacting the SPCA after the pictures began circulating on Thursday afternoon. 'We received about 50 emails overnight from people who were very concerned,' she said. 'Obviously, even if the dog is not dead, to put a dog in a washing machine would still be cruelty.'

"One of the most famous portraits of George Washington will soon get a high-tech examination and face-lift of sorts with its first major conservation treatment in decades. The Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery has begun planning the conservation and digital analysis of the full-length 'Lansdowne' portrait of the first president that was painted by Gilbert Stuart in 1796, museum officials told The Associated Press. The 8-foot-by-5-foot picture is considered the definitive portrait of Washington as president after earlier images in military uniform. One of the most famous portraits of George Washington will soon get a high-tech examination and face-lift of sorts with its first major conservation treatment in decades . Work will begin in 2016 to delicately . remove a yellowed varnish to reveal the original colors and details . intended by the artist. The painting will remain on view until then. Once it's taken to a lab, conservators will use digital x-rays and . infrared imagery for the first time to examine Stuart's work and changes . he made beneath the painting's surface. Some of the work will be . completed within view of the public. 'We are preserving this painting forever, for posterity, and at this point in its history, it needs some attention,' said chief curator Brandon Brame Fortune. 'It's still very, very stable. But we want to be sure our visitors are seeing it looking its absolute best.' Bank of America provided a recent grant to fund the conservation project, along with education programs around the picture. The 18-month conservation project will be part of a major 'refreshing' of the galleries that hold the nation's presidential portraits to give more historical information about each president's achievements, challenges and events from their time in office, said museum Director Kim Sajet. Plans call for the improvements to be completed in time for the museum's 50th anniversary in 2018. The Lansdowne portrait has been a centerpiece at the Smithsonian since 1968, and about 1 million visitors see it each year. For his first full-length portrait, Washington was dressed in a black velvet suit, his official dress for receiving the public as a civilian leader, rather than showing him as a soldier or king. It's based on earlier European portraits of aristocrats and dignitaries. The president sat for Stuart in Philadelphia and helped determine how he would be portrayed. The resulting picture was celebrated in the U.S. and Europe. It was . originally painted for the Marquis of Lansdowne, who had been a British . supporter of the colonies during the Revolutionary War. Stuart created three replicas of the portrait, one of which is held by the White House. The 18-month conservation project will be part of a major 'refreshing' of the galleries that hold the nation's presidential portraits said Smithsonian Director Kim Sajet . It was made famous when Dolley Madison saved the painting when the British burned the White House 200 years ago. The original Lansdowne painting remained in Britain for most of its history until the 1960s when it was loaned to the Smithsonian. The Portrait Gallery then bought the painting in 2001 for $20 million with a donation from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation. Conservators wanted to clean and restore the painting for many years, but the museum was reluctant to take it off view. The painting is in good condition but does have problems, including paint losses in Washington's black coat, said CindyLou Molnar, the museum's head of conservation. The biggest problem is the heavy yellow varnish that disguises details in the painting. 'It will take me quite a while to figure out what it will take to safely remove the yellow resinous varnish and not disturb the actual paint surface,' Molnar said. In 2001, film X-rays of the painting revealed some changes Stuart made in the picture. In one case, he moved a quill ink pen on the table beside Washington. The images showed how Stuart was having trouble adjusting the figure and objects in his original portrait, Molnar said. New technology will provide a clearer image beneath the surface. It's not clear, though, whether any new discoveries will be made. 'Anything we can gain in terms of materials and techniques that were used only adds to the picture of how Gilbert Stuart worked,' Molnar said. The premiere portraitist of his day, Stuart packed symbols of American history into his depiction of Washington. Furniture in the picture is carved with the U.S. seal and eagles. Books in the painting reference the Constitution, Congress and the Federalist papers. In the windows behind Washington, a rainbow appears in the sky behind dark clouds. 'The storm clouds had to do with the passing of the American Revolution,' Fortune said, 'and the rainbow signified a new beginning for the new republic.'","The 8-foot-by-5-foot picture is .

"A seven-year-old called 999 when her heavily pregnant mother started having life-threatening convulsions - and then had to direct an ambulance driver to the maternity wing. Mum-of-three Louise Evans, 30, was at 35 weeks when she collapsed and suffered a pre-eclampsic fit at home with daughters Evie, seven, and Belle Norman, five. Instead of panicking, cool-headed Evie ran into the house, grabbed the phone and called an ambulance - telling the operator that her mother was asleep and wouldn't wake up. Scroll down for video . Seven-year-old Evie (left) rang 999 when her mother Louise Evans (right)  suffered a pre-eclampsic fit. She then had to direct the ambulance driver to the maternity unit at Doncaster Royal Infirmary . She carefully followed instructions until the ambulance service arrived and rushed her mother to nearby Doncaster Royal Infirmary - where she gave birth just three hours later. But once they arrived in the hospital grounds, the ambulance driver couldn't find the maternity wing, as he was used to going straight to the emergency room. So Evie, who had been to the department with her mother for scans, stepped up again and directed him to the right building on August 30 last year. 'Evie was giving him directions, telling him 'that way' and 'round there', because she'd been to appointments with me before,' said Mrs Evans. Ambulances outside the Doncaster Royal Infirmary A&E department. Mrs Evans said her daughter Evie had to direct the ambulance driver to the maternity unity . A map showing the layout of Doncaster Royal Infirmary. Evie directed the ambulance to the maternity wing after they too her mother to the emergency room . 'She really saved the day - my little hero.' Pre-eclampsia can cause fits and other complications, as well as low birth weight and premature birth for the baby. Pre-eclampsia is a condition that can develop in pregnant women. Women with pre-eclampsia have high blood pressure and protein in their urine. Severe pre-eclampsia can be life-threatening for both mother and baby. In the baby it can cause growth problems and a premature birth. Symptoms include: . The severe convulsions, caused by high blood pressure, can be life-threatening for both mother and baby. The only cure for pre-eclampsia is for the baby to be born. Mrs Evans gave birth to her third baby girl later that day - and to say thank you for saving her and the baby's life, she allowed Evie and Belle to name her - which they did, calling her Alice. She had been watching Evie and Belle - now aged eight and seven - dressing up as princesses and putting on shows during the hot afternoon last year. 'I went inside to get them a drink, and that's the last thing I can remember. 'Putting together what I've been told, I collapsed onto the grass as I walked back outside with the drinks. 'Evie said she tried to wake me up, but I wouldn't wake, so she ran inside and grabbed the phone and called 999. 'Ever since my girls were little, I've always made sure they know what to do in an emergency, what their address is, I made up little songs to sing with Evie about our phone number so she could remember it easily. 'I don't know why, I think because I work with children, I was always aware that they needed to know what to do in an emergency. 'So Evie rang the operator and told her mummy was asleep and wouldn't wake up. 'They explained to Evie how to put me into the recovery position, so Evie and Bell put me onto my left side, raised my head.' Dr David Macklin, Deputy Medical Director at Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: 'Louise's children are to be commended for staying calm' At one point, the operator asked Evie to check her mum's mouth for food or vomit, asking: 'Is there anything in her mouth?' And she replied: 'Just her teeth'. The ambulance took around ten or 15 minutes to arrive, and Mrs Evans woke up as the paramedics walked into the garden. 'Evie and Belle weren't upset the whole time they were on the phone, but as soon as I came round, they got upset,' she said. 'I think they were just relieved, and I kept asking them if they were ok. 'It's a really scary thought that for that period of time, they were just fending for themselves with noone to look after them.' Mrs Evans was told she would need an emergency caeserian to deliver Alice. She arrived safely at 8.15pm - just three hours after Evie made the 999 phone call and spent a week in the neo-natal unit while her breathing difficulties were resolved. 'Evie and Belle got to meet Alice before I did - because I was being treated in a separate ward so couldn't see Alice for a few days,' said Mrs Evans. 'I told them they could name her, because they saved her life - so they called her Alice, after Alice in Wonderland.' Dr David Macklin, Deputy Medical Director at Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: 'Louise's children are to be commended for staying calm and doing all the right things when faced with this daunting situation. 'They carried out the right actions to get help for their Mum, didn't panic and did everything asked of them by our telephone adviser in the Emergency Operations Centre so that immediate care could be provided for Louise until the ambulance crew arrived on scene.' Operator: Are you outside? Evie: Yeah, we're in the back garden. O: Is anybody else there with you? E: No, just me and my sister. O: Right, how old is your sister? E: My sister is five.

"On Sept. 7, 1964, what is arguably the most famous political commercial of all time aired for the first, and last, time, featuring a young, carefree girl picking the petals off of a flower seconds before an atomic bomb detonates. 50 years later, the Daisy ad still resonates, created for the campaign of President Lyndon Johnson and implying that the country might be on the brink of a nuclear war should his opponent, Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, win the election. Now, the girl who starred in the famous spot, a grown up Monique Luiz, is recalling the impact the commercial had on her life, and revealing that she and her family had no idea what they were even filming at the time. Scroll down for video . Innocence lost: The Daisy ad warned of the possibility of nuclear war by showing a carefree child seconds before a bomb exploded . Today: Now 53, the star of the commercial, Monique Luiz, lives in Arizona . 'I did what my parents told me to do,' Luiz said in a recent interview with The Arizona Republic. 'And actually my parents didn't even know what [the commercial] was about. They didn't even know it was a political commercial. I already knew how to count, I think to 50, and my mom was told to teach me to count backwards. And I struggled with that.' The ad shows the then 3-year-old counting backwards, but when she reaches 10, a chilling voice-over countdown begins, ending with a nuclear bomb detonating with a giant mushroom cloud when the countdown gets to zero. 'These are the stakes,' says President  Johnson in voice-over. 'To make a world in which all of God's children can live, or to go into the dark. We must either love each other, or we must die.' The ad, which many consider the first political attack ad, never actually mentions Sen. Goldwater. Too far: Many thought that the detonation of a nuclear bomb, complete with mushroom cloud, at the end od the television commercial went to far . In the dark:  Luiz says she and her family did not even know they were filming a political ad, let alone something that would become so notorious and controversial . Though it aired only once as a paid spot, it was so polarizing that every news program replayed it for days following its premiere. In addition to members of the public criticizing President Johnson and members of his campaign for creating the commercial, as well as ad agency Doyle Dane Bernbach, people were also outraged any parent would let their child be featured in something so morbid and violent. 'My grandmother was super-nervous about the fact that there were so many people bad-mouthing my parents and me,' Luiz said. 'She was really worried because people were saying, 'How could any parents let their children be in a commercial like that? How could you let your child blow up?' ... So that's kind of how I grew up.' Then a little girl from New Jersey,  Luiz actually moved to Arizona in 1983, the same state as Goldwater. She kept quiet about her star turn for most of her life, but in 2011 attended an event in Louisiana for the book Daisy Petals and Mushroom Clouds, an examination of the ad by Robert Mann, and its impact on how political campaigns have come to be run. 'It was really strange for me,' said Luiz. 'They had me sign the books ""Monique Cozy, the Daisy Girl."" So I felt really famous for that weekend.' 50 years later, people are still talking about it.","On Sept. 7, 1964, the Daisy ad aired for the first, and only, time on television .

"Nick Clegg said sending young people caught with drugs for personal use to jail helped to turn them into ‘hardened criminals' The Liberal Democrats are 'open minded' about allowing licensed cannabis shops on British streets as part of a sweeping review of drugs laws. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said wanted an end to the ‘knee-jerk prejudice’ and desire to appear tough on drugs. The party's pre-manifesto, which will form the basis of the policies the Lib Dems will fight the next election on, promises to end imprisonment for people found carrying a small amount of drugs for personal use. It also calls for the establishment of a commission to assess the effectiveness of current drugs laws and alternative approaches, including punishment by civil penalties rather than a criminal conviction. The party's conference, which sets Lib Dem policy, is also expected to back a paper which calls for a review to consider the approach recently adopted in Uruguay and Colorado, USA, where licensed shops are allowed to sell cannabis. Mr Clegg stressed that the party was not advocating legalisation, but said that policy makers needed to have an ‘unprejudiced mind’ about drug use. Asked whether he wanted to see shops legally selling cannabis on the streets of England and Wales, he said: ‘We are not advocating blanket legalisation. ‘I am very anxious that the debate about drugs doesn't descend into a cardboard cut-out polarisation between those who say the way to deal with the drugs issue is just to lock everybody up in jail, and another bunch of people saying 'you just need to legalise everything under the sun'. ‘I actually don't think legalisation is an automatic solution and we are not saying that we are advocating that. ‘What we are saying is that we need to look with an unprejudiced mind about the initiatives that other countries and states in America are doing. ‘Quite a lot of these things are very recent changes indeed, so it is far too early to tell what lessons they teach us. ‘But I think as long as you keep an open mind about things, that's one thing, but we are not advocating that now and won't be advocating that as a definite step in our next manifesto.’ The pre-manifesto, which will be debated and voted on by party members at the Glasgow conference next month, commits the party to ‘end the use of imprisonment for possession of drugs for personal use’ and make drugs and alcohol policy the responsibility of the Department of Health rather than the Home Office. Mr Clegg said: ‘It just doesn't make sense to clog up the prisons with young people who need treatment, not a crash course behind bars about how to deal in ever harder drugs.’ At a press conference in Westminster, Mr Clegg said: ‘There are lots of other countries ... there are states in the United States, there are countries in Latin America, there's Portugal, which are doing a number of different things. ‘What we have said in our pre-manifesto is very sensible: we will look at it, we will look at what the evidence shows works. ‘I have been a long-standing advocate that drugs policy has been blighted in this country by knee-jerk prejudice and a wish to appear tough, rather than actually do what works. ‘So if other countries develop strategies which show real results, let's look at them.’ The 80-page pre-manifesto includes a plan to hand people aged 16-21 a travel pass giving them a 66% discount on bus travel in England. The Liberal Democrats want addicts to be given treatment instead of being punished . The move forms part of a targeted group of policies in a ‘manifesto for the next generation’ aimed at improving the lives of youngsters - a group of voters who have deserted the Lib Dems following the U-turn over tuition fees. Mr Clegg said: ‘We take this manifesto process seriously, and we totally accept - I totally accept - the need to show that what we say is credible and deliverable. ‘We've learnt our lesson from tuition fees - and we've learnt it the hard way. There will be no repeat of that mistake.’ The party said it planned to finance the young person's bus pass move by scrapping free TV licences and winter fuel payments for pensioners who qualify as higher rate taxpayers, although their bus passes would escape the axe. Mr Clegg said: ‘Where older people are living very comfortably having come to the end of their working lives, it is surely far better we give this support to young men and women starting out - and I'm confident grandparents up and down the country will agree.’ Other policies included in the document include a guarantee to extend the 15 hours a week of free childcare, currently available to two-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds, to all two-year-olds by the end of the parliament in 2020 - with the ambition of achieving it within one or two years. It includes a series of policies floated by Lib Dems over the summer, including protection for education spending; a parents' guarantee that children will be taught the core curriculum by qualified teachers; free school meals for all primary pupils; guaranteed lessons in sex and relationship education, financial literacy and citizenship; and a ‘Daddy month’ extension of paternity leave. Although the Lib Dems would stick to the coalition's target of balancing the structural current budget by 2017/18, manifesto co-ordinator David Laws said they would adopt a different approach, with the wealthy being hit with a mansion tax and the loss of tax breaks. He warned that without that, there would be swingeing cuts to welfare or public services. He said: ‘In our view deficit reduction needs to be fair, and this will mean a tax contribution from those with high levels of income and wealth. ‘Without this contribution, we believe that key public services such as education, the NHS and the police would be at risk of an unacceptable deterioration in quality in the next parliament, or welfare cuts would have to be so severe that millions of people would be forced into poverty.’","Deputy Prime Minister calls for an end to the 'knee-jerk prejudice' on drugs .

"Rescuers have called off the search for the small private plane that passed its Florida destination and traveled on a ghostly journey before crashing into the sea off Jamaica. Yesterday, both the Jamaican military and the U.S. Coast Guard decided to suspend air-and-sea searches for the single-engine plane carrying New York couple Larry and Jane Glazer. The plane flew on its own for 1,700 miles last Friday - after Mr Glazer apparently lost consciousness at the controls - before running out of fuel and crashing into deep waters some 14 miles off Port Antonio on Jamaica's northeast coast. Scroll down for video . Both the Jamaican military and the U.S. Coast Guard decided to suspend air-and-sea searches for the single-engine plane carrying New York couple Laurence and Jane Glazer . Rochester real estate developer Larry Glazer and his wife Jane, both 68, were aboard the aircraft that lost contact with air traffic controllers and flew 1,700 miles before crashing in the water off Jamaica . Glazer, a father-of-three and a grandfather, is pictured in front of another small plane. Both he and his wife Jane, an entrepreneur, were experienced pilots . U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Todd Coggeshall, chief of response management, said the agency called off search-and-rescue operations with 'extremely great care and deliberation'. He said a decision is made to suspend a search only after the 'area is saturated several times with a maximum number of assets, resources and crew effort, and persons in distress are still not located'. Later Sunday, Major Basil Jarrett said the Jamaica Defense Force ended its sea search after reassessing the diminishing probability of having any success. But he stressed that the Caribbean country's military 'will be vigilant along the coastline to see if any debris washes up' in coming days. After scouring an expanse of  waters off Jamaica, early Saturday morning Jamaican officials said a search and rescue team had spotted and photographed 'what is believed to be debris' from the wreckage of the crashed aircraft. But the floating material had apparently sunk before search and rescue team were able to recover the debris, and it was no longer visible later that day. The plane, which took off from New York on Friday morning, sparked panic when the pilot stopped responding to radio calls about an hour after take-off and passed its destination of Naples, Florida . Jamaican authorities believe these images show debris from the wreckage, but the material appeared to have sunk and is no longer visible in the water . Jamaican Marine Police return to the Port Antonio Marina after a fruitless search for a plane that crashed into the ocean near Port Antonio, Jamaica, Friday, Sept. 5, 2014 . The plane, which took off from New York on Friday morning, sparked panic when the pilot stopped responding to radio calls about an hour after take-off and passed its destination of Naples, Florida. It continued flying south for several hours at an altitude of 25,000 feet before entering Cuban airspace - triggering a U.S. security alert - and heading towards the Caribbean. Larry Glazer, a real estate developer in Rochester, New York, was seen slumped over the controls by a fighter jet sent to escort the plane. He and his entrepreneur wife Jane, both 68, were experienced pilots. The single-engine plane, which was traveling from New York to Florida, failed to land, entered Cuban airspace and headed towards the Caribbean. It crashed just off Jamaica on Friday after running out of fuel . Two F-15 fighter jets (file picture) were dispatched after the pilot of a private plane failed to respond but when he entered Cuban airspace, they were forced to break off . One of the fighter jet pilots said he could see the pilot of the small plane, a SOCATA TBM 700, which has a pressurized cabin, was still alive. 'I can see his chest rising and falling,' he said in a recording of his dispatch. 'Right before I left... we could see that he was actually breathing.' The plane also had 'frosted windows', an indication of a sudden loss of cabin pressure and officials said they suspected hypoxia - a deprivation of oxygen - could have caused them to pass out. The single-engine plane eventually went down in the water 14 miles North East of Port Antonio in Portland . According to ABC, the pilot requested to fly lower during two calls to air traffic control, however when they asked if he wanted to declare himself in a state of emergency, he said no. The plane was flying at 28,000ft at 10 am when Glazer asked to descend to 18,000ft because of an issue with the plane. He was cleared to drop to 25,000ft but then asked to go lower. The unresponsive plane flown by Larry Glazer was a SOCATA TBM 700, a single-engine turbo-prop with a pressurized cabin that is used as a light business and utility aircraft. Seats: Seven including pilot and co-pilot . Max cruising speed: 345mph (300 knots) Max certificated altitude: 30,000ft . Wing span: 41 feet, 6 inches . Length: 34 feet, 9 inches . History: Built by American and French engineers. Been in production since 1988 but periodic upgrades have boosted its horsepower and speed . Production: More than 125 worldwide . Air traffic control denied the second request because of the traffic traveling below Glazer. They said if he made a left turn he could bypass the traffic and descend. He made the turn, but then stopped responding. Experts say cases of pilots becoming unresponsive while their planes wander the sky are unusual, with probably not much more than a handful of such incidents over the last decade. Jamaican rescuers yesterday shut down an emergency operation center in Port Antonio, an off-the-beaten-track place with a smattering of luxury villas. The next steps for locating the New York couple's remains or wreckage from their single-engine turboprop Socata TBM700 were not immediately clear. The Caribbean waters where the high-performance plane went down has depths of roughly 6,560 feet. Jamaica Coast Guard Commander Antonette Wemyss-Gorman said it was 'beyond our capacities locally' to recover wreckage at such depths. But Leroy Lindsay, director general of Jamaica's civil aviation authority, said that French authorities have volunteered equipment and expertise is raising wreckage of the French-made plane if it is ever located on the sea floor. The plane, a Socata TBM-700 light business and utility aircraft, was registered to a development, Buckingham Properties, which is owned by Glazer. A company bio for Glazer notes: 'Larry spends some of his spare time on the ground - gardening around his house with his wife, Jane; and some in the sky - flying his plane.' The turboprop was flown by Larry Glazer, right, and his wife Jane Glazer, left, of Rochester, New York. They were en route from their hometown to Naples, Florida . An article about Glazer in the Rochester City Newspaper called him 'downtown's patron saint'. His company 'owns, co-owns, or manages nearly 13 million square feet of real estate space', it says. Jane Glazer was herself an entrepreneur, setting up and running QCI Direct, which delivers home care items through catalogs and websites. The couple, who met at camp at Seneca Lake when they were both counselors in 1964, had been married for more than 45 years and were considered stalwarts of the community. 'The City of Rochester has lost two heroes,' Mayor Lovely Warren and City Council President Loretta Scott said in a statement. 'It is difficult to put into words how much Larry Glazer has meant to our community. Larry worked hard to return a sense of vitality and excitement to our Center City. 'His efforts helped to lift our spirits and restore our sense of optimism. He has been a treasured friend and partner. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Glazer family, the partners and employees of Buckingham Properties, and all of Larry's many friends.'","U.S. Coast Guard said agency called off rescue teams with 'extremely great care and deliberation'

"A gang leader drove teenage thugs around in a stolen Audi searching for professional women out by themselves at night to mug, a court has heard. Junior Cooper, 35, drove his teenage cohorts around central London as they searched for vulnerable women, before gang members grabbed their victims, choked them and stole their bags in three violent attacks last year. Cooper was sentenced to nine years behind bars last month after he was found guilty of conspiracy to rob, while 19-year-old gang member Remy McLeod was jailed for eight years today. Gang: Junior Cooper, 35, (left) drove his teenage cohorts, including Remy McLeod, 19, (right) around central London as they searched for vulnerable women . Southwark Crown Court was told that the women were grabbed from behind by the attackers, before their bags were snatched. One of them, pianist Susanne Suhonen suffered a broken finger and may never be able to play properly again. The court heard how another woman, Jacqueline Hurst, had just parked her car near her home in Marylebone at 10.30pm on November 15, 2013 when she was attacked by the thugs. One grabbed around the waist while another choked her with her own silk scarf. She was knocked to the ground during the robbery and continues to suffer the psychological effects. ‘Before the attack I was a confident girl, happy, fun and totally unfazed by city living’, she said, in a victim impact statement read to the court. ‘Everything has changed and I am half the woman I used to be - at all times day or night I am looking behind myself.’ Ms Hurst said she now has to wait for her boyfriend to escort her from her car, and can only sit or stand with her back to a wall when out in public for fear of being grabbed from behind. Attack: Southwark Crown Court was told that the women were grabbed from behind by the attackers, before their bags were snatched . About half an hour after the attack on Ms Hurst, Sarah Lewishon was attacked as she walked from her car to her house in St John’s Wood, north London. She too was grabbed round the neck as the gang snatched her bag and knocked her down. As she refused to let go of her handbag she was dragged along the ground, and continues to suffer from severe neck pain, as well as being too afraid to go out at night unaccompanied. Ms Suhonen was attacked by the gang 11 days later, on November 26 last year, as she walked home. Her finger, which was fractured when her bag and jewellery were snatched, has healed crooked, meaning she may never be able to play the piano properly again. She told the court she was unable to sleep for about two weeks after the attack, and that she kept having nightmares. ‘I had to open my eyes and I didn’t want to close them for fear of seeing the same scenes again - needless to say I was exhausted in my domestic life and at work,' she said in her statement. Tom Nicholson, prosecuting, told the court: 'She fractured her finger on her right hand, which healed crooked, due to the fracture and the way the position of the tendon, she is unable to have it straightened. 'She might not be able to play the piano properly with that hand again. Her wrist was inflamed and extremely painful. She had to postpone her piano exam for one year because of her injuries.' Cooper, of Queens Park, north west London, and McLeod, of no fixed address, were both convicted of conspiracy to rob after a trial. Cooper, who was jailed in 2009 for a spate of robberies, was sentenced to nine years in prison at a separate hearing last month. McLeod appeared relaxed in the dock and grinned as Judge Michael Grieve sentenced him to eight years detention. The licence period was extended by three years for the protection of the public. He was also sentenced to six months for possession of a knife, which will be served concurrently.","Junior Cooper, 35, drove gang around London looking for vulnerable women .

"Moves that could decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee will begin within days, the Culture Secretary will announce today. A review of the £145.50-a-year levy is being brought forward by several months to ensure it is completed before the BBC Charter is renewed in 2016. If agreed, it would mean non-payment of the licence fee – which accounts for more than one in ten cases brought before magistrates – would no longer be a criminal offence. In a high-profile speech, Sajid Javid will announce the initial work into a review of TV licensing will be published ‘very shortly’, and question whether the current system ‘is really working’. Scroll down for video . A review of the £145.50-a-year levy is being brought forward by several months to ensure it is completed before the BBC Charter is renewed in 2016. File picture . Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has pushed for laws to decriminalise licence fee evasion and replace it with civil penalties, said: ‘This shows the Government is taking it very seriously’. Ministers had committed to launching a review and were planning for it to begin early in 2015, when a law to allow the changes receives Royal Assent. But Mr Javid, who was appointed Culture Secretary this year, will tell the Royal Television Society conference of industry executives he no longer believes it can wait until the Deregulation Bill becomes law. Doubts: Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has questioned whether the current system ‘is really working’ ‘This needs to begin now,’ he will say. ‘Very shortly I will be publishing the terms of reference for a review of TV licence enforcement. I expect it to begin taking evidence in the autumn, and to conclude early in the next Parliament.’ He will add that calling for evidence straight away, ahead of the Charter Review ‘will allow it to shape the future of the BBC in a way that works for both the Corporation and those who pay for it’. The move is likely to be popular with the public, although the BBC fears it could cost them up to £200million a year. The results of the review will not be published until after the general election. Mr Bridgen proposed the amendment to the Bill in March this year, and forced it to a vote – managing to win the backing of MPs from all three main parties. He said the existing laws penalised those on low incomes and called it a ‘shameful blot on our justice system’. The proposal has also won the backing of Crown Prosecution Service director Alison Saunders and former BBC chairman Michael Grade. In 2012, 193,049 people were prosecuted for not paying their TV licence, accounting for one in nine of all cases in the magistrates’ courts. Most of those found guilty were landed with penalties of up to £1,000 and a criminal record, and between 50 and 70 viewers are sent to jail each year after they fail to pay the court fines. Mr Javid has already opened the door to slashing the licence fee itself, saying earlier this year that it represents a ‘large amount’ of money for many families. In his first major interview he said ‘nothing should be ruled out’ when the levy, which raises £3.6billion a year for the BBC, is renewed for another decade in 2016. A Tory source said last night: ‘Sajid was sympathetic to Andrew Bridgen’s amendment earlier this year, before he became Culture Secretary. He is persuaded the review should start sooner rather than later.’","A review of the £145.50-a-year levy is being brought forward .

"A woman had been charged with the murder of her own daughter after hitting her so hard the girl's stomach burst. 11-year-old Raasania J. Coley died as a result of blunt force trauma shortly after 9pm Friday, after officers found the girl unresponsive at home in Waukegan, Illinois. Nicholette R. Lawrence, 32, was charged with first degree murder after telling investigators she had struck the child earlier in the week. Nicholette R Lawrence, 32, from Waukegan, Illinois, told police she had struck her daughter in the stomach . The young girl was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead. Lake County Coroner's office said that an autopsy determined the cause of  death to be a torn stomach as a result of blunt force trauma, Fox 32 News reports. According to police, Lawrence has two other children, who also lived in the home, but there have been no allegations of abuse towards them. These children have been placed with relatives. Lawrence was charged with first-degree murder and is held at the Lake County Jail on $5 million bond. She is next due to appear in court on September 30. According to ABC News, neighbors said Raasania rarely came outside the home. 'We've been staying here for three years, we were here half of a year before I knew they had an oldest daughter,' next door neighbor Simone Allen told the news channel. Ms Allen said the few times she did see Raasania, she had a feeling something was wrong with the child. 'Every time I looked at her I just saw the hurt and pain, it was like something she wanted to say but couldn't say it,' she added.

"A straight man was left needing surgery after he was kicked and stomped on by a homophobic gang because he refused the advances of their female friend. Alex Schofield, 25, underwent surgery to have pins and plates put in his broken arm after he was repeatedly kicked and stamped on by the gang of yobs. They shouted anti-gay abuse at him as he walked home with a friend after a night out - shortly after the high-profile Leeds Pride event. Alex Schofield suffered a broken arm in the attack and required surgery to have pins and plates inserted into his arm . Police have now released CCTV images of a group they want to talk to over the attack. 'It's important they're brought to justice for the safety of others as well as myself,' Mr Schofield said. 'If it had been someone less able than me to defend themselves it could have been a lot worse.' Mr Schofield, who works as a project manager for a large retail firm, was with his friend near Leeds bus station, West Yorkshire, when the incident occurred in the early hours of August 4. They were walking past a group of people when a woman shouted at them. He said: 'It all happened very quickly. This woman shouted 'Do you want any business lads?' 'We just said no thanks and tried to laugh it off and then one guy started shouted at us ""What do you mean no thanks? What's wrong with you?"" 'He came over and went for me, got me to the floor and then four others came over and decided they were going to join in. They were kicking me and stamping on my head.

"A sudden fire that erupted this afternoon at Six Flags Magic Mountain has collapsed one of the park's famed roller coasters, tearing away a section of track. Los Angeles County firefighters were called to the park in Santa Clarita, California at around 1:30 pm Monday after the wooden coaster Colossus became engulfed in flames. Luckily, the coaster had been shut down since last month and no injuries have been reported, according to KTLA. Scroll down for video . Collapse: A section of track and supports crumbled and collapsed after an earlier fire burned away a portion of the wooden coaster . Emergency response: Firefighters contained the blaze and no casualties were reported among the crew working on the renovation of the wooden coaster . The fire was sparked by welders working on the ride, which is under reconstruction. Aerial coverage showed emergency responders extinguishing the fire around 1:50 pm, just about thirty minutes after it started. Though the blaze was easily controlled, a section of track on a life hill gave way soon after, tearing a hole along a crest of the wooden coaster. The park  was closed at the time of the blaze. “It’s not something you see every day,” L.A. County Fire Inspector Scott Miller told the Los Angeles Times. Colossus was the world's tallest and fastest roller coaster when it opened in 1978, at 125 feet tall and 62 mph.

The amusement park announced less than two weeks ago it would turn the roller coaster into a wood and steel hybrid, with inverted loops added to the existing wooden structure. The plans for the overhaul include removing over 3,000 feet of track to accommodate the new sections.

"The photo of Ben Kopp, who died in Afghanistan in 2009 was found on dating site Plenty of Fish . Photographs of a fallen U.S. soldier have appeared on a number of dating websites five years after his death  in Afghanistan. Ben Kopp, from Minnesota, died while serving as an Army Ranger and his mother  posted several pictures of her son online to honor his sacrifice and keep his memory alive. But Jill Stephenson was devastated to learn that the photographs of her son have been used fraudulently, Fox9 reports. The deception came to light after a complete stranger found a profile on Plenty of Fish and sent a screen grab to Ms Stephenson. The profile picture for the account DavidMerced35 is actually a photo of Ben. 'It made me sick to my stomach, to be honest,' Ms Stephenson told the news channel. 'They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and in this case, I don't think it is.' Ms Stephenson also fears for the safety of those who the user may be communicating with under false pretenses. 'He's luring them with a photo of a man who looks nothing like him, so they think they are going to meet this young, good-looking guy and they could show up and not know who he is,' she said. The picture of Ben has also appeared on other dating sites - including DateHookup.com and OkCupid.com - and a number of Army Rangers and Ben's friends have contacted those sites to try and find answers. 'One of them I did see is dated November of December of 2013, so we're going back almost a year,' Ms Stephenson added. 'This guy has been at it for a while, and it's time he stopped.' Ms Stephenson has spoken with an attorney to see if there are any legal steps that can be taken against DavidMerced35. So far, the PlentyofFish profile has been taken down. Ben, who died in action in 2009, was honored for the multiple life-saving organ donations his death made possible at the Rose Bowl parade in 2010 and has also had a scholarship created in his name. The photo of Ben was used as the profile picture for the account DavidMerced35. His mother fears for the safety of those who the user may be communicating with under false pretenses . Since Fox 9 first revealed that Ben had been misrepresented online, Ms Stephenson has received a stream of letters from women who shared similar stories of meeting DavidMerced35 onlilne. 'There's so many women he's duped, not just one,' she said. Ms Stephenson was also greatly disturbed when she read of letters to learn that some of the women had sent the fraudster posing as a military man a care package. 'To get a woman to believe he's serving his country and he's not - and getting them to send care packages, wow,' she added. 'That's appalling to me.' One of the women named as Yolanda wrote to Fox 9 News to say that she met DavidMerced35 on Plenty of Fish and even spoke with him on the phone. However, she said that whenever she tried to meet him face-to-face, he always had an excuse.","Ben Kopp, from Minnesota, died while serving for the U.S. Army in 2009 .

"Australian television viewers who legally access international TV shows must pay FOUR times more than overseas viewers. New research shows that Australian consumers are being charged three to four times more when they legally watch television shows such as Orange is the New Black, Game of Thrones and Dr Who. The legal methods of watching the international television shows include pay television (Foxtel) as well as legally streaming or downloading international television shows using services such as Google Play, iTunes and Apple TV. Season 2 of the popular Netflix series Orange is the New Black currently costs Australians a minimum of $27.26 through Google Play, 219 per cent more than what US Netflix customers pay. Consumers will pay up to 431 per cent more to access the show through Foxtel. 'Australians wanting to watch the upcoming season of Walking Dead will be paying up to 376 per cent more than people watching the same show in the United Kingdom,” says CHOICE Chief Executive Alan Kirkland. 'Time and again we are seeing consumers hit with the ‘Australia Tax’ on digital content. It’s clear the business models forced on consumers by local intermediaries are subjecting Australians to artificially high prices for overseas content,' says Mr Kirkland. Australians will pay 219 per cent more than UK & US consumers to legally download Season Two of Orange is the New Black . 'Consumers are asking themselves why they have to pay a premium to Foxtel when they can access and pay a reasonable price for content through legitimate overseas services like Netflix. 'Despite what some local incumbents have said, accessing Netflix - which will spend $3bn this year paying for content from studios - is legal.' Up to 200,000 Australians are signed up to the US digital provider, Netflix, in an attempt to view the international television shows more affordably and quickly. According to a study by Gizmodo in July, Netflix is the second most popular paid-content media company in Australia, behind the market leaders Foxtel, with 27 per cent of Australians using it as their primary media rental service. Netflix's popularity comes although the service is not officially available in Australia. However, it is legal for Australians to access the on-demand streaming service, which consumers achieve with VPN proxy services that bypass geoblocking. Consumers watching the popular show through pay television service Foxtel pay 431 per cent more than those in the US. CHOICE Research claims the reason for steep prices  Australians is because consumers have very limited option to legally purchase episodes of their favourite international TV shows. The consumer advocacy group asserts that local digital providers are able to charge a premium price as there is little competition. ‘The heart of this issue is about local middlemen wanting to clip the ticket on popular overseas content rather than respond to changing technology and deliver affordable content online,' said Mr Kirkland. The exorbitant prices for legal television downloads is pertinent as the Abbott government prepares a crackdown on Internet piracy. Minister for Communications Malcolm Turnbull declared that the best way to curb online piracy was to make programs available in Australia in an affordable, easy and efficient manner . The consumer advocacy group questions how the government can address piracy issues, while Australians are being charged exorbitant prices to legally access international material. “Piracy is a problem in Australia but we expect the Government to look to the market first for a solution. 'Australians struggle to pay a fair price to watch what they want at the same time as the rest of the world. The internet has made affordable content possible but Australian providers are not delivering,’ said Mr Kirkland. The Government has outlined a number of proposals to deter consumers from illegally downloading overseas television programs, introducing an industry-run internet filter. The proposal would see internet service providers made responsible for policing online downloads. Mr Turnbull questioned why international television programs are not made available quickly and cheaply through a Spotify-style service . In July, the Minister for Communications Malcolm Turnbull declared that the best way to curb online piracy was to make programs available in Australia in an affordable, easy and efficient manner. Mr Turnbull questioned why international television programs are not made available quickly and cheaply through a Spotify-style service. '(The content owners) have to play their part to make their content available universally and affordability,” said Turnbull, according toThe Guardian. 'Anyone is entitled to sell their products for whatever price they like, that is their right, but if you want to discourage piracy the best thing you can do is to make your content available globally, universally and affordably.' Mr Turnbull has called on Australian digital  providers to consider successful music sharing services in Australia, such as Spotify, to create similar ways of streaming television online at a low price. 'If you look at what the music industry has done making songs available at low cost on Spotify and Pandora … you reduce the incentive for people to do the wrong thing. 'So everyone has to play their part … the content owners … are the ones who have to justify why they are charging more in Australia, why they are not releasing content in Australia at the same time it is released elsewhere in the world.'","Aussies are  charged top price to legally watch international TV shows .

"A morbidly obese cat named Little Dude has passed away before he could be put up for adoption. The 10-year-old feline, who weighed three times a normal cat, had moved  to a foster home in Costa Mesa, California  last week as veterinarians tried to get his weight down. But on Saturday, he passed away in an animal hospital in Orange County after he 'succumbed to his sheer size' and the stresses of his life changes, shelter staff said. 'My heart is absolutely broken right now,'  his foster mother, Angela Jackson-Brunning wrote on Saturday night on a Facebook page set up to chart his progress. Scroll down for video . Loss: Angela Jackson-Brunning had fostered Little Dude (pictured together) last week after he was brought into a California shelter when his owners could not longer afford him. He passed away on Saturday . Loved: Vets hoped to get the 10-year-old cat's weight down from 36 pounds so he could be adopted . Obese: When he was taken to the shelter last month, he was so large that he could barely walk, staff said . 'It is with tremendous sadness I must tell you all that our precious Little Dude has peacefully slipped away while in the arms of love... Please know we did everything humanly possible to help him.' Little Dude weighed 36 pounds when he was taken to WAGS Pet Adoption, a no-kill shelter in Westminster, in August after his owners could no longer afford him, NBC reported. When he arrived, he was barely unable to walk and handlers put him on a strict diet. But Little Dude did not enjoy the diet food and stopped eating altogether, WAGS reported on its website. It meant that he needed a feeding tube to make sure he got enough nutrients. He is believed to have got down to about 31 pounds, the LA Times reported. But despite his progress, staff said he was stressed by the changes in his life. Care: He was put on a strict diet but then refused to eat - requiring him to be fitted with feeding tubes . Struggles: Shelter staff believe changes in his lifestyle put stress on his already weak and aging body . Huge: Little Dude, pictured with Jackson-Brunning's dog, weighed three times of a normal cat . 'Our doctors feel that he succumbed to the sheer size of him,' Cortney Dorney, the shelter manager at WAGS told NBC. 'It was really difficult for him to breathe and the stress of being displaced from his home is pretty common for adult cats - and he was a senior cat.' Thousands of people had 'liked' Little Dude's Facebook page after his story made headlines, and fans flocked to the site to express their condolences. Posts on Facebook and Reddit had sparked donations from as far as way as Germany. 'I have no regrets and I'm certain LD would say he was pleased to be genuinely loved and adored by so many worldwide,' Jackson-Brunning wrote. 'Little Dude was a treasure. A beautiful, precious, invaluable gem. I have never known a soul like him and I doubt I ever will. I am so blessed to have been his foster mom.'","Little Dude was taken to an animal shelter in California last month after his owners could no longer afford to keep him .

"A masterpiece by English artist Joseph Turner that has been in private hands for 136 years is to be sold at auction for an estimated £20million. The large-scale oil painting, titled 'Rome, from Mount Aventine', which captures a raised view of the Italian capital, was produced by the great landscape artist in 1835. The work is said to be 'beyond praise' and highlights Turner's 'genius'. 'Rome, from Mount Aventine' - the painting by Joseph Turner which is set to fetch £20million at auction at Sotheby's when it is sold for the first time in 136 years . It was sold for the first and only time for £6,000  in 1878, when it was acquired by the 5th Earl of Rosebery, Archibald Primrose, who later became Prime Minister. The immaculately-preserved picture has remained in the Rosebery collection ever since. It has been loaned out to various museums over the last 40 years - most recently the National Gallery of Scotland - and a spokesman for the Rosebery family explained they are selling it now to fund the maintenance of their estates. Alex Bell, joint international head and co-chairman of old master paintings at auctioneers Sotheby's, said: 'There are fewer than 10 major Turners in private hands known today and this work must rank as one of the very finest. Previous owners: Turner (left, depicted in a self portrait) did the painting for Hugh Munro of Novar, and it was sold to the 5th Earl of Rosebery (right) after the patron died . Acting up: Timothy Spall as JMW Turner in the 2014 film Mr Turner - which is about the artist's life and is due for release next month . 'This painting, which is nearly 200 years old, looks today as if it has come straight from the easel of the artist; never relined and never subject to restoration, the picture retains the freshness of the moment it was painted. 'The hairs from Turner's brush, the drips of liquid paint which have run down the edge of the canvas, and every scrape of his palette knife have been preserved in incredible detail. '""Rome, from Mount Aventine"" comes to sale at the same time as the ground-breaking exhibition of ""Late Turner"" at the Tate, which will further enhance our understanding of the artist's genius. 'Its emergence on the market represents a rare and exciting opportunity for collectors.' Modern Rome - Campo Vaccino (left), sold  for £29.7million in 2010 and The Temple of Jupiter Panellenius Restored (right), sold  for £9million in 2009, both at Sotheby's . The painting used to hang alongside its sister painting, 'Modern Rome - Campo Vaccino', in the Roseberys' homes - in London and then in Buckinghamshire. That picture was sold in 2010 - for a record fee for a Turner of almost £30million - also at Sotheby's. 'Rome, from Mount Aventine' was commissioned by Turner’s patron Hugh Munro of Novar in 1828, and took seven years and many visits to Rome to complete. He kept the painting in his home until his death, whereupon it was sold on to the Earl of Rosebery. The 36ins by 49ins oil painting, still in its original frame, is being sold by Sotheby's in London on December 3. Joseph Mallord William Turner was born in Covent Garden, London in 1775, the son of William Turner, a barber and wig maker, and Mary Marshall, who came from a family of butchers. He was a Romantic landscape painter, water-colourist and printmaker, but was most famous for his oil paintings. Although controversial in his time, he is known as 'the painter of light' and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest artists in British history. His first known venture into art came when he was just 10 years old, after he had been sent to live with his uncle, Joseph Marshall, in Brentford. By the age of 11, his paintings were already being sold in his father's shop. The Blue Rigi, painted by Turner between 1841-2, shoes his love of painting natural scenes including figures made to look very small by their surroundings . He was accepted into the Royal Academy of Art at 15, and his first watercolour - A View of the Archbishop's Palace, Lambeth - was shown at the summer exhibition in 1790, when he was the same age. He painted a lot of shipwrecks, fires and natural phenomena, as they were suited to his bold style and his ability to capture the essence and energy of nature. He put a  humans in his paintings to highlight their vulnerability when put next to nature's enormity. What was perhaps most important in all of his painting though, was light, which to Turner represented God and his power. Turner's unique technique used watercolour style with oil paints and usually strong, albeit natural colours. He painted a lot of traditionally English landscapes, but also travelled around Europe a lot, a drew subjects from there too. Some of his most famous paintings include Fisherman at Sea, Crossing the Brook, and Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great British Railway. The Turner prize, which is named after him, is presented to a British artist under the age of 50 every year. It is Britain's most prominent art prize and often has extremely controversial winners, such as Tracey Emin's 'My Bed'. Meanwhile, a major new Turner exhibition is opening at Tate Britain on Wednesday. The exhibition will feature his flourishing and experimental later years - when critics were suggesting that the painter was losing his mind. Late Turner: Painting Set Free showcases work from the final 15 years of Turner's life, from the age of 60 until a year before his death in 1851. A woman admires the works of art in a new exhibition at the Tate Britain gallery in London entitled 'Late Turner - Painting Set Free' War: The Exile and the Rock Limpet, 1842 (left) and Burial at Sea, also 1942 (right) - two of the paintings being shown at the exhibition . Ancient Rome: Agrippina Landing with the Ashes of Germanicus, 1839 - another of the paintings on display at Tate Britain's exhibition showing Turner's later work . Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory) - the Morning after the Deluge - Moses Writing the Book of Genesis, 1842 (left) and Rain, Steam, and Speed - The Great Western Railway, 1844 (right) It brings together 180 works from the UK and abroad, as well objects such as palettes and even the spectacles which once belonged to the London-born barber's son. Many of the paintings show Turner developing a new understanding of light and colour, but at the same time the artist was being mocked and derided. There are oils, such as 'The Departure Of The Fleet', among the last painting he exhibited before he died aged 76. And watercolours including 'Bamborough Castle', which is on loan from a private collection and sold for almost £3million at auction in 2007. The exhibition features maritime scenes, themes from classical history, and Turner engaging with the new technology of the age, steam power. A woman views a painting by J.M.W. Turner entitled 'Dawn of Christianity' (right) at the exhibition, which will run until next January . Co-curator Sam Smiles said: 'Turner created the most startling pieces during this period but for whatever reason, a major exhibition on Turner's later years has not been done before. It's a missing exhibition. 'But it's a timely exhibition. With an ageing population, and attitudes to age altered, this exhibition speaks to our questions about later life, creatively who are we, what do we do and how do we cope with ageing? 'Turner was continuously innovating, staying sharp and experimental. He's a wonderfully good role model for somebody who is coping with older age and staying vital. 'He defies the peak and decline model which people associate with artists. In that, he's not unique. But he shows a spectacular engagement with contemporary society in a way that no other artist at the time was doing. 'At the time Turner had some loyal patrons and some relatively sympathetic critics but there was also vicious, venomous copy suggesting that he'd lost his mind and that he'd got worse as he got older, talking about his eccentricities.' Visitors to Tate Britain can also see a colour wheel installation made in response to Turner's work by Danish-born artist Olafur Eliasson, who famously created the illusion of a glowing sun at Tate Modern.","The large-scale oil painting, titled 'Rome, from Mount Aventine', was produced by the great in 1835 .

"They say a good book is timeless. But you'll have to rush to get the most out of these incredible tomes. Carved out of ice, the 250-pound blocks tell stories of the earth using leaves, seeds and dirt to raise awareness about the rapidly melting glaciers and our need to save them. Scroll down for video . Story time: This sculpture left on a river bank in Alberquerque was carved from frozen river water and laced with seeds in a bid to emphasize the need to save the rapidly melting glaciers . Tales of the earth: The books are placed on the earth to melt and regenerate banks hit by drought . Ecological artist Basia Irland, from Albuquerque, carves the books out of frozen river water. She then laces them with seeds - then leaves them on the bank side to melt and repopulate the land. The project, entitled Ice Receding/Books Reseeding, has been rolled out across America using fauna from each local region. Project: Basia Irland (right) spends days carving each 250lb block, which is then released into the water . Unique: Each tome in communities across America is unique as it uses fauna from the local river banks . Crystallized: This book, entitled River Oats Volume Two, uses Chasmanthium latifolium from Dayton, Ohio . Mountainous: Restoration Text uses Cottonwood Populus Freemonii from Rio Grande in New Mexico . A Canadian story: Red maple was used to design this sculpture for children near Ottawa River . And it will be used in school curricula to teach schoolchildren about biodiversity. Ms Irland explains: 'Ice Receding/Books Reseeding emphasises the necessity of communal effort, artistic insight, and scientific knowledge to deal with the complex issues of climate disruption and watershed restoration by releasing seed-laden ephemeral ice sculptures into rivers.' 'When an ecosystem is restored and the plants grow along the riverbanks, they help sequester carbon, mitigate floods and drought. Keen readers: These students waded through the water in Ottawa River to read the Columbine flower book . Nature at its finest: The summer project sees the books glisten in golden light before drifting into the water . 'They pollinate other plants, disperse seeds, hold the banks in place (slowing erosion), create soil regeneration and preservation, act as filters for pollutants and debris, supply leaf-litter (for food and habitat), promote aesthetic pleasure, and provide shelter/shade for riverside organisms including humans.' Irland works with stream ecologists, biologists, and botanists to ascertain the best seeds for each specific riparian zone.","Ecological artist Basia Irland carves books out of frozen river water .

"A 12-year-old thug who bashed a teenager around the head with an iron bar, causing permanent hearing damage, has been sentenced to just three months probation. Jordan Biggs, 16, was cycling to a relative's home with a friend in Birmingham when they were confronted by a gang of youths, including the younger boy. As they tried to cycle away, the 12-year old whacked Jordan on the back of the head with the bar, fracturing his skull. Jordan collapsed minutes later and was rushed to hospital where doctors removed a potentially-deadly blood clot on his brain. The attack has left the Birmingham teenager partially deaf in one ear. But the 12-year-old attacker, who cannot be named for legal reasons, received just a three-month referral order at the city's youth court after he admitted wounding - and was told to pay his victim just £100 compensation. Jordan Biggs, 16, pictured in hospital after the attack which fractured his skull and caused a blood clot . After he was attacked, Jordan managed to make his way home before he collapsed and was rushed to hospital . Jordan Biggs now has permanent hearing damage in one ear and must be fitted with a hearing aid . If the schoolboy completes the probation order, in future he will not have to disclose his criminal record as the conviction will be 'spent'. Jordan's mother Sharon Heap has now contacted the Crown Prosecution Service to demand the case is referred to the Attorney General in a bid to increase the sentence. She said: 'Police were stationed to remain at my son's hospital to begin with to wait to speak to the surgeon, as his condition was so serious it was not known if he would live. 'And his attacker gets a referral to a youth offending team. What message does it send out? What deterrent is it? 'The age of criminal responsibility is ten so why is a 12-year-old, who smashes a modified metal bar on to my son's skull in an unprovoked attack, just given a slap on the wrist? Jordan Biggs, pictured, was attacked by the 12-year-old for no apparent reason . 'Jordan's life has changed forever, the impact has been devastating. I want to see the sentence reviewed and a sentence which fits the crime handed out.' Jordan had been cycling to his aunt's house with a friend riding on the back of the bike when yobs targeted them in Stechford. His mother said: 'Jordan was about to spend his last night in Birmingham before moving to Weston-super-Mare to be with me. 'He had been staying with my sister, his aunt, while he finished his exams. 'I went to Birmingham on the Saturday to stay overnight and was due to take him home with me the next day. 'He and his friend Luke had been cycling along Gillcroft Road, Stechford, and were very close to my sister's house when the attack happened. 'They saw three lads on the opposite side of the road. One shouted across: ""Have you got a cigarette?"" Luke called back, ""No, sorry"". 'The lads then crossed the road and one tried to pull Luke off the back of the bike. 'Jordan then saw something out of the corner of his eye. He thought it was perhaps a hammer, he just saw a glint of metal. He ducked his head and then felt something strike the back of his head. 'Jordan tried cycling faster to get away. He felt something running down the side of his head, put his hand up and saw blood on his hand. 'At that moment he jumped off the bike, told Luke to cycle to the house to get me and then Jordan himself started running up the road back home. 'He was in shock at that point. Meanwhile, myself and other relatives had been sitting down ready to watch the England game on that night, expecting Jordan and Luke to be back any minute to watch it. 'The next thing I know Luke comes in and behind him Jordan comes crashing through the door shouting ""Mum"" and collapses on the floor. 'I leapt up and ran outside, afraid someone may be coming in after him. When I get back in, my brother-in-law had got Jordan into a chair and was giving him first aid. Jordan was still bleeding a lot, was in shock and was shaking. It was horrendous.' It was the start of a living nightmare for the loving mother. Jordan was rushed by ambulance to Heartlands Hospital where a CT scan revealed the teenager had suffered a fractured skull, bleeding on the brain and a significant blood clot. In the early hours of the following morning - the day he was meant to travelling to Weston-super-Mare with his mother- he was transferred to intensive care at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Sharon Heap (pictured with her son Jordan) is 'disgusted' at the 12-year-old attacker's light sentence . He spent more than four hours in theatre undergoing brain surgery to have the clot removed. He remained in intensive care for three days and hospital for 11. 'The surgery was successful and medically he is okay now, although he has lost some of the hearing in one of his ears and requires is going to have to have a hearing aid fitted. Jordan can no longer skateboard, dance, or do any other activities in which he could suffer another fall, as it would risk causing further damage to his head . 'But psychologically, the impact of what happened has been devastating. He has had to give up so many things. He had previously worked in a kitchen and wanted to be a chef when he completed his exams. 'He was due to start an apprenticeship, but he did a few days and couldn't cope with the pace and noise after the attack. 'He was very active and loved street dancing. 'He raised money by street dancing for Cancer Research - his nan had died of cancer. But he has been told he can't do that or some of the activities he loved doing before because a fall might cause further damage and it's too risky. 'He can't do skateboarding, which he enjoyed. He gets angry now because he's frustrated he can't pursue the life and activities he had planned. 'He's moved to live with me now in Weston-super-Mare but it's not the life he had been looking forward to.' Police arrested three juveniles after the attack earlier this summer. Two 14-year-olds were released without charge. A 12-year-old was charged with wounding, and he appeared at Birmingham Magistrates Youth Court last week where he admitted the offence. He was handed just a three-month referral order to the Youth Offending Team and was ordered to pay £100 compensation to Jordan. Ms Heap said: 'The police said to me: ""What can you do with a 12-year-old? Do you lock him up and perhaps set him on his way to a life of crime?"" 'But I am absolutely disgusted at the sentence, especially considering everything Jordan has been through and is still going through.","Jordan Biggs was bashed on the head by a 12-year-old using an iron bar .

"Nick Clegg yesterday unveiled plans to soak the rich with taxes on mansions, large pension pots and second homes. The Lib Dems propose investing in big projects such as building electric railways and 300,000 homes a year if they return to government after next May’s election. And Mr Clegg admitted these would have to be funded by higher taxes on the well-off. His party’s ‘pre-manifesto’, a draft of its plans for office, contains the controversial pledge to impose a ‘mansion tax’ on homes worth more than £2million. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg admitted big projects such as building electric railways and 300,000 homes a year would have to be funded by higher taxes on the well-off yesterday . Mr Clegg also said capital gains tax – currently 18 per cent for those who pay the basic rate of tax and 28 per cent for higher-rate payers – should be raised . Mr Clegg also said capital gains tax – currently 18 per cent for those who pay the basic rate of tax and 28 per cent for higher-rate payers – should be raised. He called for the rate to be ‘more closely aligned with income tax’ but would not give further details, saying it would have to be decided by the Treasury. Both policies bring the party closer to Labour, which is hammering out plans for a tax on high-value homes and has said that it would look at the capital gains tax threshold. A Lib Dem spokesman said there is evidence CGT is being used for tax avoidance as it is levied at a lower rate than income tax. Wealthy people who receive some of their income from shares can pay the lower rate of CGT. His party’s 'pre-manifesto' contains the controversial pledge to impose a 'mansion tax' on homes worth more than £2million . But higher rates would also hit those selling second homes in the UK or holiday homes abroad. The tax is liable on any profit from the sale, and has been enforced with the threat of jail and fines in a recent crackdown by HM Revenue and Customs. In the past, senior Lib Dems have suggested it could be increased to the same rate as income tax – 40p and 45p for higher and top-rate tax payers. But there is evidence from the UK and abroad that raising the level of CGT fails to increase revenue as very wealthy businesspeople manage to avoid paying it or defer payment. The Lib Dems would also reduce the level at which people are eligible for tax relief on their pension pots to £1million from the current £1.25million. Their policy document says these measures would ‘ensure that those with the highest incomes and wealth are making a fair contribution’. But the Conservatives claimed the party’s plans would cost up to £19billion more than claimed and would involve ‘more taxes and more spending’. A Lib Dem spokesman denied this, saying the proposals would be costed next year. Other measures in the ‘pre-manifesto’ include stricter laws to cut carbon. The Lib Dems propose a ‘decarbonisation target’ which would mean 60 per cent of electricity must come from green energy by 2030. This could lead to higher energy bills for homes and businesses. The party also wants to give new fathers a ‘use it or lose it’ month off to spend with their newborn and introduce 20 hours a week of free childcare for working families. The Lib Dems have called for a ban on jailing people caught with drugs for personal use. Mr Clegg wants drug users to be given treatment instead – and his party will look at introducing civil penalties for low level offences to avoid giving users a criminal record. The Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday that sending young people caught with drugs to jail helped turn them into ‘hardened criminals’. But last night former Conservative home affairs spokesman David Davis said the plan was ‘simplistic’ as the threat of jail was known to deter users of hard drugs who have a ‘corrosive effect on society’. Around 1,000 people are jailed every year for possessing drugs for personal use. Half of these cases involve class A drugs such as heroin. Also included in the document is a promise to give votes to 16-year-olds in all elections and referenda. The Lib Dems would pass a ‘Nature Act’ imposing tough targets for achieving clean air, clean water and creating more green space, as well as marine and coastal reserves . They would build 300,000 homes a year (compared to around 125,000 at present) and launch a huge home insulation programme that would cost billions, with council tax rebates for those who take part. Under-21s would be given a discount bus pass so they can afford to travel to college or work, and the Lib Dems would commit to end the use of landfill ‘in a generation’ by increasing recycling . They would introduce a form of proportional representation for elections and reform the House of Lords. The party would also enforce a Royal Charter on press regulation along the lines recommended by Lord Justice Leveson.","If Lib Dems return to government in May, 'big projects' would need funding .
Mr Clegg said well-off would have to pay price - with mansion tax a priority .
Also wants capital gains tax raised, bringing political stance closer to Labour .

"Two sisters and their friend have died in a wrong-way crash on the same stretch of a Florida highway that has claimed seven other lives this year. Gabrielle Lanier, 33, was driving her sister Lakritra, 31, and their friend John Pierson, 26, south on the northbound lane of I-275 in Tampa on Sunday morning when they collided head-on with a semitrailer truck carrying petroleum. All three were killed, although the other driver was not injured. The sisters, who lived together, leave behind nine children, the Tampa Bay Times reported. The crash was the fourth wrong-way crash on the road over the past year. Before the tragedy, seven others died in collisions, even though the Florida Highway Patrol insists the road is clearly marked. Killed: Gabrielle Lanier (pictured wearing yellow) was driving her sister Lakritra, left, and their friend John Pierson (pictured with his sister right) on Sunday morning when they collided with a semi . Authorities said Gabrielle, a mother of four, was likely  driving the wrong way on the road for about two minutes when she smashed into the truck driven by  Michael Kellogg, 50, at 6am on Sunday. Both vehicles came to a rest in the northbound lanes with debris scattered across the road. No oil leaked from the struck semi. Gabrielle had a number of traffic violations through the years, including driving with a suspended license, and authorities continue to investigate if alcohol or drugs played a role, the Times said. 'It's hard,' Lakritra's ex-husband, Zebadiah Lanier, told the Tampa Bay Times. 'Everybody's trying to digest and really grasp what really happened.' Tragic: They were in this Honda as it drove the wrong way onto I-275 and crashed head-on with a truck. It is the fourth wrong-way collision on the stretch of road since February and this one brings the death toll to 10 . Elaine Pierson called her son, John fun-loving. 'John was a good boy,' she said. 'He loved his family and we loved him.' The crash is the fourth fatal wrong-way crash at the spot since February, when four USF students were killed by a wrong-way driver. Two weeks later, another person was killed as they drove the wrong way and in July, another wrong-way driver died near 5th Avenue North. But authorities said the roads were properly marked. 'There are wrong way signs especially at the ramps,' Florida Highway Patrol Sgt. Steve Gaskins said. Scene: The driver of the trailer, left, walked away without any injuries. Authorities are looking into whether drugs or alcohol played a part in the crash and insisted the road is properly marked . 'Up and down the interstates especially since they have the reflectors on the roadway so if you're travelling opposing traffic you're seeing a lot of red signals.' He added that the three previous crashes involved drugs or alcohol. Zach Morales, who lost a friend on the highway a few years ago, said something needs to be changed. 'If there is signage there, they have to think about where it's placed at because obviously people aren't seeing it,' Morales told WTSP. 'Even if you're a drunk driver you'd think that seeing a sign would help.'","Gabrielle Lanier was driving her sister Lakritra and their friend John Pierson south on the northbound lane of I-275 when they smashed into a truck .

"Business leaders have accused Labour of seeking to burden firms after the party announced plans to make it easier for employers to be sued. Last year the Coalition introduced moves to tackle frivolous employment tribunal cases by making claimants pay an up-front fee. But yesterday Labour’s rising star, Chuka Umunna, told the Trades Union Congress conference that he wanted to scrap the fees for many people by introducing a means test. Labour's Business spokesman Chuku Umunna told the Trades Union Congress conference that he wanted to scrap the employment tribunal fees for many people by introducing a means test . Labour leader Ed Miliband attended the TUC Gala dinner at the Hilton Hotel in Liverpool after his party revealed it is planning to reform the tribunals system . Ed Miliband before the TUC dinner - the Labour Party have supported calls for tribunal fees to be reformed . Fighting cases at employment tribunals currently costs firms an average of £8,500. Since the £1,200 fee was introduced, employment tribunal cases have dropped by three-quarters – with sex discrimination cases dropping by 80 per cent and race claims down 60 per cent. Under the current system, any employee who wins their case will be reimbursed. And low-income workers or people who claim certain benefits can apply to have their fee waived. The fee can also be lifted if it would prevent the claimant from paying an overdue rent or mortgage payment, if they are threatened with legal action over unpaid bills, or if they are faced with uninsured losses due to fire, flood, theft or criminal damage. The fee has been credited with almost destroying the multi-billion pound industry based on vexatious discrimination claims against employers. But Mr Umunna, Labour’s business spokesman, revealed that he is planning to reform the tribunals system. He made his announcement just hours after the TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady demanded that the tribunal fees be scrapped, fuelling concerns that Labour is in thrall to the unions. Miss O’Grady said: ‘If your boss robs you of holiday pay, why on earth should you have to find more than £1,000 to see justice done in an employment tribunal? It’s plain wrong that workers are priced out of justice. So – and let’s demand it – we want employment tribunal fees scrapped, once and for all.’ Only hours later, addressing the Trades Union Congress in Liverpool, Mr Umunna said he wanted to introduce a means test, claiming that the Tories’ system is preventing the poorest employees from upholding their rights in the workplace. He said: ‘We have fought to defend people’s rights and voice in opposition but these rights are only meaningful if you can get proper redress. ‘The current tribunal system is unfair, unsustainable and has resulted in prohibitive costs locking people out of the justice they are entitled to. ‘Affordability should not be a barrier to workplace justice. So if we are elected, the next Labour Government will abolish the current system, reform the employment tribunals and put in place a new system which ensures all workers have proper access to justice.’ TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady made a speech on Sunday calling for tribunal fees to be scrapped . But James Sproule, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, criticised the plans, saying: ‘Claimants on benefits or low incomes are exempt so we don’t think the fees are a barrier to wronged employees getting compensation.’ He added: ‘Before refundable charges were introduced, fewer than one in ten tribunal cases against IoD members were won by the claimant, wasting large amounts of money and time for businesses. Fees are a sensible way to weed out weak or vexatious claims.’ And Neil Carberry, from the Confederation of British Industry, said: ‘Firms have been frustrated for years by false and misleading claims that take up time and resources. ‘Recent reforms which encourage early resolution of disputes are a step in the right direction, and fees to make a claim are a vital part of that.’ Last night Tory business minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘Of course we want to make sure everyone can get justice in the workplace. That’s precisely why we’re giving waivers to people who can’t afford to pay employment tribunal fees.’ He added: ‘These proposals would undermine our record jobs recovery and make it harder for employers to create jobs. Labour just haven’t learned their lesson.’","Chuka Umunna revealed he is planning to reform employment tribunal cases .

"A baby’s first birthday party ended in terror when the floor collapsed, sending children and parents plunging to the cellar below. Birthday girl Emily Swift had opened her presents and was preparing to blow out the candles on her cake when disaster suddenly struck. There had been no warning of a problem inside the terraced house until a large section of the kitchen floor gave way. Terror: Emily Swift, one, came close to tragedy when her birthday party was interrupted by the kitchen floor suddenly collapsing beneath her family . Smiles: Birthday girl Emily Swift had opened her presents and was preparing to blow out the candles on her cake when disaster suddenly struck . Emily was in her heavily-pregnant mother’s arms when the collapse happened and they were both saved from falling up to 7ft when they were grabbed by the baby’s two grandmothers. Emily was said to be ‘screaming and very distressed’ amid the chaos. However, children aged three and five, along with the birthday girl’s father Ryan Swift, 22, and uncle David Swift, 29, fell to the room below. The uncle was credited with saving the partygoers from a more serious fate when he quickly realised the lit candles could trigger a gas blast. The collapse had caused a leak and Mr Swift scrambled back up and blew the candles out. Around 25 people were said to be at the party, but witnesses estimated there were about ten people in the kitchen when the incident happened . Paramedics treated seven people at the scene. Emily’s mother Katie Havrylak, 29, and three-year-old cousin Kellsi, who suffered cuts to her face and ear, were taken to hospital for treatment. No one was seriously injured. Ms Havrylak is seven months pregnant with her third child and was given the all-clear by doctors after the check-up at Bradford Royal Infirmary. Emergency services rushed to the house in Bradford, at 3.25pm on Saturday. Around 25 people were said to be at the party, but witnesses estimated there were about ten people in the kitchen when the incident happened. Many were gathered close to a work-top as the birthday cake was about to be presented. Emily’s aunt Denise Farby, 22, said: ‘We had put seven candles on the birthday cake, along with a big number one, and we had lit the candles. ‘We were just about to sing 'Happy Birthday' when we felt a bit of shaking and then the kitchen floor just collapsed.’ Mr Swift, the uncle, described the scene after the floor caved in as ‘pandemonium.’ He said: ‘The cooker was ripped off the wall and there were kids falling into the cellar. There was gas everywhere. People were pulling kids out of the hole left, right and centre.’ Shocked parents then realised the danger of birthday candles igniting escaping gas and Mr Swift acted quickly. ‘Everyone was trying to reach the cake, I had to climb over people to blow out the candles,’ he said. Mrs Farby added: ‘Everyone is calling David a hero because he saved our lives. We are all in shock and grateful nobody was seriously injured or killed.’ Party host Ryan Swift, a warehouseman who also has a nine-year-old daughter, fell several feet through the hole, which took up about one third of the kitchen. He said: ‘When it happened, for a flash, I thought “I’m dead.”’ Emily with her father Ryan. Emily was said to be ‘screaming and very distressed’ amid the chaos . Describing the chaos, he said: ‘People were trying to hold onto the worktops to stop themselves from falling into the cellar.’ His little niece Kellsi fell the full 7ft to the floor below. ‘People were screaming to get my nieces out of the hole. I was getting them up out of the hole but I couldn’t pull myself up.’ He then used his phone as a light and climbed the cellar stairs to get out of the basement. The family had lived in the rented property for about four weeks and one relative at the party claimed the ‘beams were full of dry rot.’ The house has been sealed off pending an inquiry and structural repairs and the family is staying with relatives. Firefighters joined police and paramedics in the street, along with electricity and gas staff. Phil Warden, Watch Commander with the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, confirmed there had been a ‘structural collapse’ with a cracked gas and water pipe as a result. He described the incident as very rare.","Emily Swift and her mother were narrowly saved by grandparents .

"Disgraced: Councillor Robert Bleakley, 43, sent the shocking texts on his council phone . A councillor who used a work computer to watch pornography has now racked up a £2,400 taxpayer-funded phone bill after sending vile messages and calling premium rate sex lines. Councillor Robert Bleakley, a representative of Tyldesley in Wigan, Greater Manchester, sent the shocking texts - discovered after he racked up the huge bill - on his council phone. Now female council officers have been instructed not to talk to the disgraced 43-year-old independent councillor - who has been described as ‘having a problem with women.’ In one, discussing the court case of former politician Chris Huhne and ex-wife Vicky Pryce, he said ‘I hope she likes porridge’ and that he hoped she would be sexually assaulted in jail. And he texted, in reference to another woman he'd seen on the television news: ‘Someone please tell her to f*** off and don't come back’, a cross-party standards board panel heard. Mr Bleakley also sent one reading: ‘Aren't they f*****g idiots. No wonder women are just cooking and washing material.' It is not the first time Mr Bleakley, who lives in an £80,000 two-bedroom terraced home, has faced a scandal - after he was found in March to have accessed pornography on his council computer. He was also found to have deliberately altered a council email in an attempt to smear a senior officer. At the latest standards hearing, the panel judged he had breached the members’ code of conduct. Councillor Bleakley, who now represents Wigan Independents, did not attend the hearing and has had his council mobile withdrawn and will be ordered to undergo equal opportunities training. Wigan Town Hall: Female council officers have been instructed not to talk to the disgraced independent councillor - who has been described as 'having a problem with women' Donna Hall, chief executive of Wigan Council, said: ‘I am appalled and sickened with the language used in these messages. ‘It is quite clear, judging by the content of the text messages, that he has a problem with women. I will not tolerate this prejudice, nor will I allow him to come into contact with female officers until he has undertaken equal opportunities training. ‘After reviewing the evidence the panel agreed that Coun Bleakley had broken the council’s ICT policy and breached sections of the members’ code of conduct when he used his mobile phone inappropriately. ‘As a result, Coun Bleakley was given a number of sanctions, including the removal of his IT equipment, including his mobile phone, removal of his internet access. 'He must also undergo equal opportunities training, and female officers will be instructed not to speak to him.’ In 2004 the councillor was . disqualified for three years after he verbally abused a female cleaner . at Wigan town hall and threatening to get the sack after a minor traffic . accident. The Standards Board of England, which oversees councillors' conduct, investigated him and ruled that he was 'aggressive, domineering and intimidating'. Council meeting: The chief executive of Wigan Council said she was 'appalled and sickened' by the messages . Mr Bleakley was also aggressive to a member of the public who raised . an objection to a planning application, and published a leaflet . containing false allegations that other councillors had threatened a . council officer. At the time, Sir Anthony Holland, chairman of the Standards . Board for England, said: 'We carried out a thorough investigation into . the issues and are pleased with the verdict. 'No wonder women are just cooking and washing material' Councillor Robert Bleakley . 'We care about local . democracy and do no want to see its name tarnished by the poor . behaviour of people like ex-councillor Bleakley.' Mr Bleakley stood as the Lib Dem's parliamentary candidate for Worsley, Greater . Manchester, in the 1997 and 2001 general elections. At the time of the 2004 investigation he was leader of the Liberal Democrat group on Wigan Council. He was suspended again for six months in 2010 after being accused of bullying an ex-policewoman who got a job as a community safety officer and branding her ‘that woman’ during meetings. He had also been investigated by police over accusations of misconduct in a public office but was told he would face no criminal charges.","Councillor Robert Bleakley, 43, racked up a £2,400 taxpayer-funded bill .

"Jennifer A. Phippen, 37, is accused of giving a drunk teenage girl an IV instead of getting medical help . A 37-year-old woman is accused of giving a drunk 14-year-old  an IV instead of calling an ambulance or getting medical help. Jennifer A. Phippen has now been charged with felony injury to child after the alleged incident at a house last month in Idaho. The girl was at a birthday party for a teenage boy with several of his friends when she drank several shots of alcohol and eventually lost consciousness. According to the Ada County Sheriff's Office Phippen gave the girl an IV after some of the teens told her the girl was passed out and had vomited. Phippen gave the girl about 400-to-500 ccs of fluid - instead of calling paramedics, seeking medical treatment for the girl, or calling her parents. Phippen also put the girl in the shower in an attempt to rouse her. The girl eventually regained consciousness and walked home that morning. Phippen is charged with two counts of felony injury to child - one for providing the 14-year-old girl and other teenagers with alcohol  and one for not getting the girl the appropriate medical treatment for what Phippen suspected was alcohol poisoning. Ada County prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Phippen Friday and deputies arrested her Friday afternoon. Phippen was booked into the Ada County Jail Friday afternoon on a $300,000 bond. If she does not post bond, her initial court appearance will be Monday afternoon. The crime of felony injury to child is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

"At first glance, he may seem like any other adorable kitten - but behind those wide eyes lies a tragic story. The runt of a litter of seven, Mighty the stray became so cold after he was born that he lost the tops of his ears to frostbite. The five-week-old cat, who lives at the Axhayes Cat Adoption Centre in Devon, is now desperate for a loving home - and an owner willing to look past his deformity. Scroll down for video . Needs a home:  The Axhayes Cat Adoption Centre in Devon are trying to find a home for Mighty . The infant, who also lost a toe to the cold, was one of the first of his siblings to be born - and sadly when it came to nurturing her brood, his mother, Spire, forgot about tiny Mighty. Phil Punnet, 57, deputy manager at the cat centre, said he believes the speed of the birth meant Mighty's 18-month-old mother did not have time to round up her young. He said: 'The mother was in one of our maternity wards. When she started giving birth, the kittens were just popping out one after another. Mighty was one of the first and is the runt of the litter. 'Kittens are just like children and you need to keep them warm. His mother didn't notice him and he hadn't been embraced or licked clean so was obviously not in a good way. 'We were able to warm him up when we got to him, but his ears came off about a week later and so did one toe. Fighter: Despite losing the tops of his ears and a toe to the cold one week after being born, the five-week-old kitten is playful and holds his own with his six siblings . 'He's not out of the woods yet but he's coping well and we don't think his hearing will be seriously affected. 'He's playing with the other kittens and doesn't seem to think there is anything wrong with him. He's been to the vet a few times and they believe it was a case of him getting too cold after the birth.' Mighty's mother was found on a farm near Tiverton, Devon, and was taken to the cat centre, near Exeter, where carers discovered she was heavily pregnant. Nearly out the woods: The cat sanctuary's deputy manager said Mighty is almost back to full health . Within two weeks she had given birth to her brood, pushing the number of residents at the cat sanctuary up to around 180. Phil added: 'Mighty might be small but he holds his own. He's just as playful as any other kitten and I think he will absolutely be able to find an owner. 'We like to offer our kittens to people in pairs so siblings can stay together, as soon as Mighty has had his vaccinations he will be ready to go to a home.'

"Arrest: Robert Kaiser, 32, claimed he fell while holding his son, who later died of a brain injury . A dad has been accused of fatally shaking his two-month-old son after the boy kept him awake. Robert J. Kaiser, 32, has been charged with second-degree unintentional murder after the death of the baby was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner. Kaiser, the baby's primary caregiver, had been looking after the boy at his home in Farming Township, Minnesota on August 27 while the baby's mother was away for the day. He texted her at one point to say that the baby was keeping him awake, she told police. When she returned to the house, she noticed that the boy 'seemed different'. He was taken to  Albany Hospital before he was taken by air ambulance to a hospital in the Twin Cities, the Star Tribune reported. The boy had suffered a traumatic brain injury and later passed away. An autopsy on the baby revealed that he also had healing broken ribs, as well as other injuries that could have been the result of abuse. When authorities questioned Kaiser about what had happened, he explained that he had fallen over while holding the boy and re-enacted the fall on video. Accused: Kaiser, pictured in images from Facebook, had texted the baby's mother earlier that day to say the baby was keeping him up while he tried to sleep.

"A mother who found eggs of the world deadliest spider in a bunch of Tesco bananas had to incinerate her vacuum after using it to clean them up. Abby Woodgate, 30, was told by pest control experts that she would have to burn anything that had come into contact with the Brazilian wandering spider eggs, as the arachnids are highly venomous. She first thought the bananas had mould on them after noticing a white lump when they were delivered to her home from the store in Highwoods Square, Colchester. Scroll down for video . Abby Woodgate, 30, from Colchester found tropical spider eggs in a bunch of Tesco bananas . But when she poked it with a toothpick, a cocoon opened, revealing dozens of tropical eggs. She immediately threw the fruit in the bin, but a few eggs dropped on her kitchen floor, which she vacuumed. 'I couldn't believe it when the little cocoon opened. I thought it was just some mould and I was trying to get it off so I could use the rest of the bunch,' Mrs Woodgate said. 'Even when I saw what was in it - it looked just like frog spawn - I still didn't think the worst. But then it dawned on me and I jumped and threw them in the bin.' She first thought the bananas had mould on them after noticing a white lump, but when she poked it with a toothpick, a cocoon opened . One bite from an adult Brazilian wandering spider carries enough venom to kill 225 mice . The mother-of-one called the Tesco store, which had delivered the shopping to her home and she was told someone would collect them. But she then received a call to say pest control experts would be round instead. Mrs Woodgate said: 'The pest controllers asked where the eggs were and I told them the bin and they said 'right, we'll take that'. 'Then they asked had anything else come into contact with the eggs, and I told them about my vacuum cleaner, so they said 'we'll have to take that too'. All they could tell me is they thought they were tropical spider eggs.' It is not yet known exactly where the eggs came from and what species of spider they belong to. The bananas were delivered from the Tesco store in Highwoods Square, Colchester, to her home . Spider experts have told her it was unlikely the tropical eggs would hatch because it was not warm enough in the UK and there were no adult spiders with them. They also said it was not absolutely necessary to fumigate her home. Mrs Woodgate said: 'That's good news, but I'm still on the lookout for anything about the place. If I see one, I've been told it's safe to squash it, as you might do other spiders. 'My husband is better at that, so that'll be his job.' Tesco has offered to replace her bin and the cleaner. A spokesman said: 'We set ourselves high standards for the food we sell and were concerned to hear of this incident. 'We've offered Mrs Woodgate a gesture of goodwill and will be asking our supplier to investigate.' Tesco sources bananas from Brazil, Costa Rica, Equador and Colombia, home to some of the world's most venomous spiders. A Tesco store in  Kent was forced to close for several hours in November last year after a Brazilian wandering spider was found under a box of bananas. The Brazilian wandering spider appears in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's most venomous spider. Their Greek name Phoneutria actually means 'murderess' - an indication of their deadly bite. They are known as the wandering spider because they do not build webs, but instead walk the jungle floor at night looking for prey. Brazilian wandering spiders  are nocturnal, and so find places to hide during the day. This is why they are so dangerous, because they hide in houses and cars, where they are easily disturbed by humans. They may be considered the most toxic spider, but they are not the biggest. Their leg-span reaches up to five inches. When the spiders are defending themselves, they lift their body up on their hind legs in a defensive display. Bites have killed 14 people until an antidote was found in 1996. The venom causes extreme pain and inflammation, loss of muscle control and breathing problems, resulting in paralysis and eventual asphyxiation. The spider's bite can cause an unwanted erection in men, sometimes lasting for four hours.","Abby Woodgate, 30, found 'deadly' spider eggs in her Tesco bananas .

"Britain's housing market is finally starting to cool with prices rising by just 0.1 per cent last month, banking giant Halifax said yesterday. Martin Ellis, the bank’s housing economist, said there are signs of ‘an easing in the pace of house price growth’. The slowdown in the housing market comes after rampant rises in house prices in many parts of the country, particularly London and the rest of the South East. Halifax's housing economist said that there are signs of ‘an easing in the pace of house price growth’ In 1995, just 186 homes in England and Wales were sold for £1million or more during the entire year. By comparison, the Land Registry’s latest figures show a total of 1,028 were sold for more than £1million in April, a jump of nearly 40 per cent on the same month last year. But yesterday’s figures from the Halifax show the housing market appears to be finally slowing down. In May, house prices rose by four per cent, compared to only 0.1 per cent last month, it said. In May 2014, house prices rose by four per cent, compared to only 0.1 per cent last month (File photo) The slowdown is a huge relief for young people trying to buy their first home at a time when wage increases have failed for many years to keep up with the rampant rises in house prices. Mr Ellis said: ‘There are some signs of an improvement in housing supply, both in terms of more second-hand properties coming onto the market and increased numbers of new homes. ‘These trends, if sustained, should help to improve the balance between supply and demand, contributing to an easing in the pace of house price growth.’ He said the prospect of an interest rate rise ‘at some point over the coming months’ is also likely to curb demand. The Bank of England governor Mark Carney will speak to delegates at the TUC today in a speech likely to address the explosive issue of low pay rises and rising interest rates. The central bank has kept the base rate frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009, but Mr Carney has made clear that the first rise for seven years is on its way. Increases will be ‘limited and gradual’, he insists. The central bank has kept the base rate frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009, but Mr Carney has made clear that the first rise for seven years is on its way . While house price growth has slowed, prices are still considerably more expensive than they were last year. The average price of a home was £186,270 in August, but this is still just over £16,000 higher that it was in the same month last year. Guy Meacock, from the buying agency Prime Purchase, said: ‘On balance the next few months will be the time to buy a home rather than sell. ‘Vendors who want to exchange by Christmas are coming to market at an unfashionable time of year and may need to be more flexible on the price if they want to meet that deadline. ‘Prices are already softening so there are good opportunities for buyers.’ Matthew Pointon, a property economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said buyers are ‘refusing or unable to stretch themselves much further.’","In 1995 186 homes sold for more than £1m; this April 1,028 went for that amount .

A damning report by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB), leaked to the Daily Telegraph, shows that flight officials were warned in 2009 about the danger of the development on The Tower. The operator of London Heliport warned the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) that the building work meant helicopters flying low because of fog would breach rules saying they have to fly at least 500ft from structures. According to the report, the warning 'does not appear to have led to further discussion or action'. Capt Barnes was flying from Redhill Aerodrome, Surrey, to Elstree, Herefordshire, on the morning of January 16 last year to pick up restaurant tycoon Richard Caring. Mr Caring sent his pilot text messages and phoned him, saying weather conditions were too poor for the flight. But Capt Barnes pressed on regardless, sending a text to Mr Caring which said: 'I'm coming anyway will land in a field if I have to.' Scene of the crash: The operator of London Heliport warned the Civil Aviation Authority that the building work meant helicopters flying low because of fog would breach rules saying they must fly 500ft from structures . Twelve people were injured in the crash, which happened on January 16 last year at around 8am . The helicopter crashed into the crane, avoiding the skyscraper by 105ft and falling 700ft to the ground . After finding he could not land in Elstree,the pilot requested to land in Battersea. The helicopter travelled at low altitude along the Thames and made a right turn towards The Tower in dense fog. The report says Capt Barnes may not have seen the tower through the clouds, and also could have been distracted by changing radio frequencies. The helicopter crashed into the crane, avoiding the skyscraper by 105ft and falling 700ft to the ground. A number of vehicles on Wandsworth Road suffered heat damage or were damaged by wreckage. One car was completely consumed by fire. Buildings close to the crash were also damaged. Workmen Richard Moule and Nicki Biagoni had lucky escapes as they were due to be on the crane that morning but were both late for work. Since the accident the air traffic controller, Nats, has ruled that helicopters must not be instructed to fly at low altitudes over the south bank of the Thames. 'Any pilot routing along the south bank of the river and passing within 500ft vertically of the top of the crane, or the building once the crane is removed, would be in breach' of the rules, the AAIB said in its report. The CAA and Department for Transport declined to comment until the report is published.

"Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond has been accused of playing politics with today's Royal baby announcement. The SNP leader used the official Scottish titles of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in a message welcoming the news this morning. He wrote: 'Congratulations & best wishes to the Earl & Countess of Strathearn. Wonderful to hear they're expecting their second baby – very happy news!' Mr Salmond's intervention, just 10 days before the Scottish independence referendum, comes amid mounting mounting concern in Buckingham Palace about the prospect of a ‘yes’ vote. The future of the Royal family has been a source of debate in the independence campaign, but the 'Yes' camp have insisted that the Queen will remain head of state in a future independent Scotland. But one Labour MP today suggested Mr Salmond had used the Royal couple's official Scottish titles to ram home the point that the monarchy would still be in place after independence. Scroll down for video . Alex Salmond opted for the rarely-used official Scottish titles of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge this morning . The Prime Minister meanwhile used the more common 'Duke and Duchess of Cambridge' in his message . David Cameron wore traditional morning dress for the Royal wedding of Prince William of Wales to Catherine Middleton April 29, 2011 . Hollywood star Alan Cumming has urged Scots to seize the ‘wonderful opportunity’ to leave the UK – even though he lives in the US and cannot vote. The X-Men actor returned to Scotland to join Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon  making a final push for votes ahead of September 18. Amid criticism that he will not have to face the consequences of a ‘No’ vote, Mr Cumming said: ‘It kind of gets my goat when people say that. ‘Nobody says why can’t David Cameron or Ed Miliband have a say, they’re not able to vote either.’ He added: ‘I feel so passionate about this. My brother said yesterday, he lives in Southampton, in England, so he doesn’t have a vote either, he said ‘it doesn’t matter that I don’t live in Scotland, Scotland lives inside of me.' Thomas Docherty, MP for Dunfermline and West Fife, said: ‘This is fantastic news for the Royal family and for everybody in the country and should not be politicised in any way. ‘Alex Salmond is absolutely shameless in his determination to shoehorn his obsession with independence into everything and anything.’ The future of the Royal family in an independent Scotland has been thrown into doubt in recent days amid claims that the Queen is concerned about future conflicts of interest. Pollsters today claimed that the Royal baby announcement could help tip support back in favour of the union. A spokesman for ComRes told MailOnline: ‘The Queen is generally very popular in the UK and so are the young royals like the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, probably more so than Prince Charles for example. ‘The royal family has not really played a part in the referendum debate until now but the Queen’s reported concerns and now Kate’s pregnancy will bring that into focus. ‘There are a number of reasons why the poll could swing back to no. It won’t be just because of the baby, but that and other issues about the royal family could influence the result’. But a poll in The Times found more ‘yes’ voters now want to ditch the Queen as head of state of an independent Scotland than want to keep her in place, according to a new poll. The YouGov poll found that 46 per cent of supporters of separation now believe that an independent Scotland should break its links with the UK royal family. A total of 40 per cent believe an independent Scotland should keep the Queen, with 14 per cent undecided. Among ‘no’ voters, the results are very different. More than two thirds of ‘no’ voters – 69 per cent – believe that an independent Scotland should keep the Queen, with just 18 per cent in favour of a Scottish republic and 13 per cent undecided. When the Duchess first became pregnant in December 2012 the SNP leader Mr Salmond was quick to offer his ‘warmest congratulations’ - but again used the official Scottish titles. Mr Salmond added: ‘Everyone in Scotland will join me in wishing the couple the very best as they prepare for the birth of their first child.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband sent his regards on Twitter this morning . The Prime Minister today responded to the news on Twitter. He said: ‘Many congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. I'm delighted by the happy news that they're expecting another baby.’ After the Duchess first fell pregnant Mr Cameron said she and Prince William would make ‘absolutely brilliant parents’. Mr Cameron confirmed he was informed of the news shortly before the public announcement. He added: ‘I got a little note coming into a meeting I was having and I found it quite difficult to keep it to myself.’ The following year, in 2013, Mr Cameron revealed how the entire Cabinet was sent into a panic thinking that the royal baby had arrived during a meeting at Chequers. But the piece of paper rushed into a meeting was not an update from the palace but the latest from Lord's cricket ground.

Prince William and Kate Middleton with Baby 10 day-old Prince Geroge is photographed with their dog Lupo, in the garden of the Middleton family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, England . The Prime Minister had instructed officials to keep him informed of the score from the Ashes match between England and Australia. He said: ‘We had a Cabinet meeting and I asked someone to bring in the cricket score half way through just to see how it was going. ‘And a bit of paper arrived in the Cabinet room and everyone of course thought it was an announcement about the royal baby. ‘There was a great intake of breath and actually it was because Ken Clarke wanted to know what the score was because he was meant to be at Lord’s.’ In 2010 when it was announced that William and Kate were to marry Mr Cameron revealed that he had received the news in a call from Buckingham Palace during a cabinet meeting, and it was greeted with ‘a great cheer’ and ‘banging of the table’ from fellow ministers.","Alex Salmond said: 'Wonderful to hear they're expecting their second baby'

"The bottle, which once contained Prieure des Couleys, will be sold at auction on September 13 . A bottle of Cognac drank by  Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin shortly before their deaths will be sold at auction. The cosmonauts enjoyed the bottle of Prieure des Couleys after learning they would fly pilot and back-up respectively on the Soyuz 1 rocket launch in 1967. Tragically, Komarov was killed after the aircraft's parachutes failed during its descent, while Gagarin died the following year in a plane crash. Signed by each of the men and dated February 11 1967, the bottle is now being sold for £2,000 at the German auction house, Auctionata. When chosen for the Soyuz 1 launch, Gagarin had already become the first man to fly into space on Sputnik 1 in 1961, while Komarov had commanded the first multi-person voyage, Vokshod 1, three years earlier. The Russians had planned to launch the Soyuz 1 with Komarov inside and send off a second aircraft with two additional cosmonauts the following day. They would meet in space and dock, with Komarov expected to climb from one to the other as part of the mission to mark the 50th anniversary of the Communist revolution. Before blast off, several malfunctions were reportedly found within the rocket and its capsule and even Komarov, a father-of-two,  knew he would not make it back alive. But, in a bid to save his friend, he reportedly told demoted KGB agent, Venyamin Russayev: 'If I don't make this flight, they'll send the backup pilot instead.' He perished trying to descend back to earth when the rocket's parachutes failed to open. Gagarin was banned from space flight following the incident and began training as a fighter pilot but died during a routine flight after training as a fighter pilot the following year. Viktoria Kisseleva of Auctionata said: 'In 1967 Yuri Gagarin and Vladimir Komarov were selected to be part of the Soyuz 1 mission. 'Gagarin was a national hero and had wanted to lead the mission but the Soviet government did not want to risk his life. Vladimir Komarov (left) and Yuri Gagarin (right) drank the cognac after learning they would fly pilot and back-up crew respectively for the doomed Soyuz 1 mission . The cosmonauts were national heroes after Gagarin flew the first rocket in to space in 1961 and Komarov the first multi-crew mission in 1964 . An image of the Soyuz 1 crash from Russian television shows the charred remains of the aircraft after it plummeted to earth . Komarov's charred remains were on view in an open casket during an open funeral for the cosmonaut . 'Instead they named Komarov the mission commander. 'Despite the Cold War, the Soviet elite were never shut off completely from Western products and Gagarin managed to get hold of a bottle of fine French cognac. The bottle is signed by both men and dated February 11 1967 . 'He drank it on February 11, 1967, the day he was named in the back-up crew for Soyuz 1, probably with Komarov and the other cosmonauts chosen for the mission. 'Gagarin signed and dated the bottle on its label. 'There are other signatures on it which we presume were those of the other cosmonauts including Komarov but we can't say for sure. 'The bottle is a sad reminder of the tragedy that befell the pair. 'Komarov died when Soyuz 1 crashed after re-entering the Earth's atmosphere and six months later Gagarin perished while training to become a fighter pilot. 'In 1992, a German artist called Andora went to Russia and met with people who had been involved in the Soyuz mission. One of them had this bottle and sold it to Andora. 'He has spent the last 20 years compiling a collection of Soviet space flight memorabilia and has now decided to sell it.' The auction will take place on September 13.","Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin drank cognac before Soyuz 1 mission .

"A church has had its application to retune its 282-year-old bells turned down because the 'old-sounding ring' should be preserved. St Michael's Church, in Michaelchurch Escley, Herefordshire, had applied to have its bells, which have not been rung for 30 years, retuned as part of a wholescale refurbishment. The six bells were slightly out of key and had not been tuned for more than 250 years, but in a rare ruling Mark Ockleton, deputy chancellor of Hereford and a judge of the Church's Consistory Court, decreed that they must not be fixed. St Michael's Church, in Michaelchurch Escley, Herefordshire, had applied to have its bells, which have not been rung for 30 years, retuned as part of a wholescale refurbishment . The ancient bells were installed at the church in 1732 and have chimed the same notes since. However, Hereford's Diocesan Advisory Committee (DAC), which oversees around 400 churches, recommended they should be re-tuned to make their peel more melodious. The church agreed that now was a good time to do so, as the bells has to be temporarily removed while the building was refurbished. But Deputy Chancellor Ockleton refused permission on the basis that sounds of the past - melodious or otherwise - should be preserved for posterity as they were. Rules on British churches dictate that all major work has to go through a DAC, who check over the plans before passing on the final decision to a Chancellor. Chancellors, who are often former High Court judges, then make the call on whether the plans are in the interest of the Church. Turning down the call for re-tuning, Deputy Chancellor Ockleton said he found it 'a little troubling' that the DAC had called for the tune-up 'on the basis that if an old thing can be 'improved' by being modernized, it should be'. He continued: 'Tuning bells is irreversible. We do not have many sounds preserved from before the days of sound recordings and those that survive are a valuable part of our heritage.' He added: 'Irreversible tuning of a complete old ring is a serious matter, not merely to be accepted 'on the nod.' The six bells were slightly out of key and had not been tuned for more than 250 years, but it was decreed that they must not be fixed (file picture) He said that the ring of the bells at St Michael's Church appeared to be untouched, save for the effect of a crack on one bell which is to be repaired by welding and which will then sound more or less the same again. 'If the bells are then restored for ringing the sound they make will be the same as when they were installed in 1732. That is something to be valued and to be proud of,' he said. He said that he would not rule out re-tuning if the bells were so bad that 'the mission of the Church was affected', if they 'let the church down in some way' or if bell-ringers were reluctant to ring them. But he continued: 'There is no suggestion of that here. Indeed it is not apparent whether the parish even realise that they have an early-eighteenth century sound that they propose to destroy. 'The mere fact that the bells are not listed for preservation is not a reason for not preserving their sound where the work is not shown to be necessary.' Grandmother Lynne Lloyd, 65, who lives and works on a farm near the church with her husband Royston, 67, said she was looking forward to hearing the bells when they are put to use, as they have not been rung for 30 years. 'I quite like the sound of the bells, so they won't bother me even if they are a little out of tune. 'My in-laws are buried in the churchyard so we have a strong connection. We got to the harvest festival and at Christmas.'","Church barred from re-tuning its bells so their 'old ring' can be preserved .

"Chris Davis, pictured, who has left his position at the prestigious Sherbourne School . The headmaster of a leading public school has been sacked days after the start of a new term, after saying that the boys there 'just don't work hard enough'. Chris Davis, 53, had come from Eton College to lead the prestigious Sherborne School, and hoped to raise academic standards by cramming more academic work into his students' days. But on Friday the governors of the £32,850-per-year school announced that Mr Davis had left. Sherborne, which was founded in 1550 by Edward VI in the Dorset village of the same name, has educated prominent churchmen and army generals, as well as famous figures such as codebreaker Alan Turing and Downton Abbey actor Hugh Bonneville and Coldplay singer Chris Martin. It was also meant to become the alma mater of novelist Evelyn Waugh, but he was stopped from attending after his brother published a novel in 1917 alluding to homosexual activity at the school. The only reason given for his departure by the governors was that the school needed a change of 'strategic direction of the leadership.' However, it had previously been suggested that many parents and boys resented Mr Davis' frequent comparisons with Eton, and the notion that Sherborne may be 'second best'. Scroll down for video . Prestigious: Chris Davis, 53, had led Sherborne School in Dorset, but was suddenly dismissed on Friday . Picturesque: The school was founded in 1550 by Edward VI, and charges fees in excess of £30,000 . Sources close to the school say that attempts to change the way the institution worked stoked resentment among pupils and long-serving staff. A statement posted to the school's website insisted: 'There is absolutely no element whatsoever of untoward activity on the part of the outgoing Headmaster, or any other member of the staff, that has led to or contributed to this decision.' Speaking to The Times, Mr Davis's wife Innes, 52, declined to comment on the reasoning behind the departure. Mr Davis previously taught at Eton, where he himself was educated. He joined after a career in the City, and was the head of Warre House, of which David Cameron was a member in the 1980s. Alumni: Downton Abbey actor Hugh Bonneville, left, and Second World War codebreaker Alan Turing, right, are famous figures who attended Sherborne . Literary: Spy novelist David Cornwell, also known as John le Carré, also attended the school . During his tenure, which began in 2010, the school had enjoyed strong academic results. More than 90 per cent of A-level papers this year marks at the A*, A or B grade. Chair of the school's board of governors Gordon Parry released a statement saying the process for appointing a new headteacher had begun. He added: 'Our intent is to have made this appointment by the end of this Michaelmas term. 'We are delighted to announce that, in the meantime, Ralph Barlow, currently deputy head will serve as headmaster.' Sherborne School has educated prominent figures for hundreds of years, and recent success stories to issue from its 15th-century halls include actors, authors and musicians. Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham in Downton Abbey, attended the school, as did thespian Jeremy Irons and Dad's Army actor John Le Mesurier. Alan Turing, the mathematician who helped defeat the Nazi's enigma code and turn the tide of the Second World War, also attended Sherborne. Heritage: Sherborne has educated boys since its foundation in 1550. The above photograph shows the school's dining rooms in the 1930s . Pop credentials: Coldplay singer Chris Martin, pictured on stage this year, is another old boy of the school . The school has a strong pedigree in the arts, having educated spy novelist John le Carré and poet laureate Cecil Day-Lewis, father to Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis. Coldplay singer Chris Martin was also a student there. The institution's website includes military luminaries Major General Patrick Cordingley, Major General Julian Thompson and Lieutenant General David Leakey, the prestigious usher of the Black Rod in Parliament. The school has enjoyed strong academic performance recently. On A-Level results day it was announced that 40 per cent of all grades were A*s or As, with six boys meeting offers to study at Oxford or Cambridge. At GCSE this year half of boys achieved A*s in science subjects, with 11 high-achievers scoring straight A*/A grades.","Chris Davis, 53, has been dismissed from £32,00-a-year Sherborne School .

"A rusty old Jaguar convertible which does not run has sold at auction for more than £77,000 - nearly five times its estimate - and the new owner will now have to spend another £120,000 to get it on the road. Incredibly, the dilapidated E-Type Roadster sold for £77,760 - the same price as a brand new, top-of-the-range F-Type convertible - its spiritual successor. This is because it is one of the extremely rare 'Flat Floor' models, of which there are thought to be just 170 left in existence. Scroll down for video . Rustbucket: The dilapidated Jaguar E-Type convertible sold for an incredible £77,760 at auction . What a state: The inside of the car, which had been hidden away off the road for the last 20 years . In need of some TLC: The beautiful Jaguar will need around £120,000 spent on it to get up and running again . The car has been off the road and hidden away for the last 20 years. When it was finally reintroduced to the world at Bonhams’ Beaulieu auction at the weekend, there was no shortage of interest. The unnamed buyer was forced to pay way over the £15-20,000 estimate, but even after he restores it there is a chance he could still make a profit on the car. In 2011, a Flat Floor model E-Type in excellent condition was sold for £25,000 less than this one - showing how demand is increasing rapidly. Slim pickings: There are only around 170 'Flat Floor' model E-Types left, which is why they are so expensive . Wheely good: Even after he has paid to renovate it, the buyer could still make a profit on the rare vehicle . Nick Goldthorp, from Jaguar specialist Classic Motor Cars in Shropshire, said: 'The early cars are the collectible ones and prices are still going up. 'I was not really surprised when it sold for £77,000 and, when restored, it will probably be worth in excess of £200,000.' When it is back on the road, the E-Type’s 3.8-litre engine will develop around 265 brake horse power. This will give the convertible sports car a 0-60mph time of seven seconds and a top speed in excess of 150mph. Restoration: The E-Type will hit top speeds of more than 150mph once it has been restored to its former glory . Glory days: A 1961 Jaguar E-Type sits in a driveway back in its heyday . Last month, the E-Type was voted the greatest car of all time, beating Aston Martins, Rolls Royces and the VW Beetle to the crown. The iconic car, launched in 1961, was given the award by new Discovery Channel show Wheeler Dealers , picking up 32 per cent of the vote. The Mini came in second with 20 per cent, just ahead of the Porsche 911, with 18 per cent. Eight British cars made the top 10, with Mike Brewer, the show's car trading expert, saying: 'This underlines the incredible heritage of British car manufacturing, where originality, style and performance have been the hallmarks of many of our greatest cars.' The Jaguar E-Type, also known as the XK-E, was produced between 1961 and 1975, and is cherished by Brits as one of the greatest, if not the greatest car the country ever made. It was designed by Malcolm Sayer, a Norfolk man born in 1916 who spent almost 20 years working for Jaguar, and also designed the XJ-S. He worked at Bristol Aeroplane Company during World War II, before heading to Iraq to work at Baghdad University - an institution, it turned out, which did not exist. He joined Jaguar in 1951, and was one of the first car designers to use aerodynamics. He sadly died from a heart attack in 1970 - five years before the E-Type went out of production. The car came into being as a result of Jaguar's incredible racing success throughout the 1950s. The company's racing department was tasked with using the Triple Le Mans 24-Hours winning D-type’s construction approaches to build a road-going sports car to replace the XK150. The E-Type, made in Coventry, was initially a two-seater, rear wheel drive coupe, though a four seater version was released later. The original cars cost around £2,100 - significantly less than what was being put on the market by competitors like Ferrari and Aston Martin. The Series 1 hit the British market in July 1961, and continued to be produced for seven years. It had a 3.8-litre engine, which was upped to 4.2 litres in 1964, a top speed of around 150mph and could reach 0-60mph in around seven seconds. The main change for the 1968-71 Series 2 was the front lights - which were no longer protected by glass, and a redesigned interior, before the Series 3 was introduced with a new 12 cylinder, 5.3-litre engine. The Series 3 was notable for its slatted front grill and flared wheel arches, and also had power steering. Of the three models, it is the Series 1 which is most iconic and also most desirable today. Essentially, it was speed restrictions in the 1970s which spelt the E-Type's end - it could not meet new U.S. safety regulations, and the XJ-S was built in its place. In motorsport, Australian driver Bob Jane won the 1963 Australian GT Championship in a lightweight E-Type, and the car also performed well in SCCA Production sports car racing. A Series 3 won the B-Production championship in 1975.","Incredibly rare 'Flat Floor' model sells for almost five times its estimate .

"The New York Yankees honored their retiring captain Sunday with a 45-minute pregame ceremony that included surprise appearances by NBA great Michael Jordan and baseball ironman Cal Ripken Jr. But there was one person for whom Derek Jeter's two-decade career has meant more than anyone on the field at Yankee Stadium. Brielle Saracini, 23, couldn't be at Derek Jeter Day, a celebration of the Yankee's shortstop three weeks before the likely end of his baseball career, even though she desperately wanted to be. Mutual admiration: Brielle Saracini may be Derek Jeter's biggest fan, but he's in awe of her bravery . Bright moment: Brielle first met Derek Jeter as a 10-year-old, just two weeks after losing her father in 9/11 . Fans in high places: Jeter is greeted by basketball legend Michael Jordan at Derek Jeter, the event Brielle Saracini bought tickets for but was unable to attend . The 23-year-old first met Jeter as a 10-year-old girl just 15 days after losing her father. Her first Yankees game was on September 26, 2001. Her father, Victor Saracini, was the pilot flying United Flight 175 that was hijacked by terrorists and flew into the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Brielle had read a book Jeter co-wrote with Jack Curry and it struck a chord with her. She loved the way Jeter wrote about his close relationship with his parents. Brielle went back to school the day after her father died, unable to stay at home with her thoughts. 'I didn’t know what to do so I hid behind my Yankee cap,' Brielle told the Yes Network in 2011. School authorities decided to waive their no-hat rule for her and Brielle wore the hat everywhere. She became obsessed with baseball and Jeter and decided that he could be the one person who could help her in her hour of need. She penned a letter that began, 'My name is Brielle Saracini. As you have heard, there was a horrible accident that involved the Twin Towers, there was a hijacking on a plane. Terrible people are in this world, but you and I both know that. . . That horrible hijacking happened to my father,' reports the New York Daily News. Dark time: Brielle (left), her mother Ellen Saracini (center) and her elder sister Kirsten (right) during a church service for Victor Saracini on September 18, 2001 . Miraculously, the letter found its way to Jeter, who called an awestruck Brielle and invited her, her 13-year-old sister Kirsten and their mother Ellen to the game on September 26. It was a moment of light in a very dark time for the family. The years passed, but Jeter stayed in contact with Brielle and her family, and always greeted her with a hug. 'He’s such a genuine person,' Brielle told the New York Daily News. 'You never get the feeling he’s doing it because he has to do it, or that he’s going through the motions. You get the feeling that he wants to do it.' Brielle grew up, went to college and began a career and her life was going in the right direction until the summer of 2013 when she was diagnosed with Hodgkins' lymphoma. She underwent aggressive chemo, all the while willing Jeter to recover from his own physical problems that affected his season. Brielle says that she was watching a Yankees game on TV on September 26, the 12th anniversary of their meeting. Grief: Victor Saracini was pilot of the second plane that was hijacked and crashed into the World Trade Center . Big fans: For Brielle (center) and her sister Kirsten, their day out at the ballgame with Derek Jeter is a treasured memory and a day where they could forget their heartache and be children again . She left the room and when she went back, there was a missed call on her phone. Jeter had called in the middle of the game to tell her, 'I just wanted to call and say, keep your head up, stay positive and everything will work out just great.' After an initial scan that indicated she was cancer-free in 2014, Brielle received devastating news: the cancer had returned. She began a second round of even more intensive chemotherapy. Jeter's experience with the disease is extremely intimate: his sister battled Hodgkins' lymphoma 13 years ago. When Brielle managed to make it to a Yankees game in July, he told her,'You’ve got to stay positive. You shouldn’t worry about statistics or what anybody says. You are going to beat this. Everything is going to be great,' reports the New York Daily News. On Sunday, Brielle was to weak to be there to support Jeter, even though she wanted to more than anything. Outgoing captain: Derek Jeter #2 of the New York Yankees gestures to the crowd during Derek Jeter Day . Special bond: Jeter and Brielle have kept up contact over the years - and she needs him now than ever, as she battles an aggressive form of cancer for the second time . Reserved as always and with no hints of tears, Jeter thanked people a dozen times as he spoke to a capacity crowd of 48,110 at Yankee Stadium for about three minutes before a 2-0 loss to Kansas City further damaged New York's slim playoff chances. 'It's kind of hard to believe that 20 seasons has gone by so quickly,' the 40-year-old Jeter said following a 1½-minute ovation. 'You guys have all watched me grow up over the last 20 years. I've watched you, too. Some of you guys getting old, too. But I want to thank you for helping me feel like a kid for the last 20 years.' ""In my opinion, I've had the greatest job in the world.

"Fans of the Ohio State Buckeyes may have found it difficult to sit through the team's Sept. 6 loss to the Virginia Tech Hokies, by a score of 35 - 21, but there was one very bright spot for the home team -- the Ohio State marching band. In a stunning tribute to television, performed during halftime, the band not only played the music of nearly a dozen popular television shows, but also somehow managed to choreograph themselves to perfectly create each program's iconic image. Scroll down for video . Impressive feat: The Ohio State marching band played tribute to classic television shows, like The Simpsons, seen here with Bart riding on his skateboard . Bring me my dragons: Daenerys Targaryen would have loved the band's tribute to Game of Thrones . Among the shows included in the act were Batman, The Simpsons, Dragnet, The Addams Family, The Lone Ranger, The Brady Bunch, The Office, Hawaii Five-0, and Game of Thrones, to name just a few. The band has previously wowed crowds with tributes to Michael Jackson, Pirates of the Caribbean, and even Abraham Lincoln. This weekend also marked the first time the band performed since the firing of band director Jonathan Waters for ignoring a culture of sexualized rituals and hazing among members of the band, including students being pressured to march in their underwear and participate in sexually themed stunts.

"An Australian man whose wife died in a horror bus crash in Kenya has been left stranded at a remote hospital. On Sunday, Richard King and his wife, Olga, were travelling with 20 other tourists and three Intrepid Travel tour guides on a bus when it overturned and plunged into a nearby creek, west of the nation's capital of Nairobi. Local police identified the dead as Ms King, who was in her 60s, and an Australian man. One of the victims died on the spot, Kenyan media said. The other passengers were taken to the Narok Country Hospital - where Mr King remains. Scroll down for video . The crash happened just outside the city of Nairobi in the East African country of Kenya . Narok County Governor Samuel ole Tunai (arms outstretched) visited the injured tourists in hospital. The Melbourne civil engineer told The Daily Telegraph from his hospital bed that he had not heard from Australian authorities since the crash. 'I am here by myself. I have broken ribs and a dislocated collarbone,' he said. Mr King said he and his wife - who had worked at Medicare in Bentleigh located in Melbourne's east - were in Kenya to mark the start of their retirement with a safari trip they had always dreamed of taking. The Kings' son is doctor in Port Macquarie on New South Wales' central coast and has expressed his displeasure. Adam King said his father was well enough to be moved. 'I would have thought the relative of one of the deceased should be a priority,' he told The Daily Telegraph. An unidentified injured woman speaks to a nurse and the county governor, Samuel ole Tunai, in an image released by the local government. The Narok County Government said the spouses of the dead Australians were among those admitted to hospital. They suffered injuries and 'deep shock', a statement said. The local government released images of officials visiting the wounded at Narok County Referral Hospital on its Facebook page. Eighteen of the injured and all Intrepid Tours staff have now been flown to Nairobi for treatment. In a statement released to Daily Mail Australia, James Thornton, the managing director of the Melbourne-based Intrepid Tours said: . 'Our first concern is with those affected and their friends and families,' he said. 'Senior managers from our operations team in Kenya are assisting passengers and staff involved.' County police commander Paul Kerich told local newspaper The Standard that the bus, which was carrying three staff and 22 tourists, was en route to Tanzania. He described the crash zone was a renowned black spot. 'There are a lot of sharp bends and steep depressions a long this road,' Mr Kerich said. 'We want to appeal to drivers especially those who are new to exercise caution so as to avoid unnecessary deaths.' The tourists on board were from the United Kingdom, the U.S., Germany, Switzerland and Australia. Kenyan roads have a poor reputation. Last August, 41 people were killed in a bus crash in the same area as this latest incident. Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters the crash was tragic. 'It's awful beyond belief for the families of those involved,' he said on Monday morning. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular support to the families of those affected.","Two Australians dead after Kenyan tour bus overturns and plunges into a creek .

"GM has plans to put a Cadillac on the road in two years that won't require drivers to hold a steering wheel or put their foot on the gas. GM is calling the new technology 'Super Cruise,' promising it will be able to master steering, acceleration, stopping-and-going in gridlocked traffic, and braking at highway speeds of 70 miles per hour. Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra described the groundbreaking model in a speech to the Intelligent Transport System World Congress in Detroit. Scroll down for video .

GM's new communications system could help cars avoid crashing and reduce gridlock by having cars within 300 meters of each other communicate basic safety information. These vehicles could advise each other on speed, the direction cars are traveling, and location. If a driver ahead of your vehicle slams on their brakes, the information can be transmitted to other drivers to prepare for the sudden halt in traffic. Those safety features will be even more useful when GM finishes developing its first intelligent highways in Detroit. Those roads will feature cameras and sensors to warn cars about upcoming traffic. However, to operate these systems without using the steering wheel or pedals themselves, drivers must remain alert to take the wheel when traffic conditions need real judgement. model featuring V2V, or 'vehicle-to-vehicle,' technology within the next two years. The Super Cruise will initially be featured in the 2017 Cadillac CTS sedan, according to Road and Track. That feature will enable cars to communicate with other cars, warn of traffic hazards, and ideally make roads safer. 'With Super Cruise, when there’s a congestion alert on . roads like California's Santa Monica Freeway, you can let the . car take over and drive hands free and feet free through the . worst stop-and-go traffic around,” Barra said. 'If the mood strikes you on the high-speed road from Barstow, California, to Las Vegas, you can take . a break from the wheel and pedals and let the car do the work. Having it done for you -- that’s true luxury.' CBS Boston notes that today's autonomous vehicles are required to have all the same manual controls that are found in normal vehicles, and a licensed driver operating the car must be able to take over at any moment. GM is cautioning that this technology is not a self-driving car, and that drivers must be alert and able to take the wheel when traffic conditions require it. 'We’re rolling out active safety technology today. We’re . not going to wait until we have a driverless vehicle that can . work in 100 per cent of situations,' said Jon Lauckner, GM's chief technology officer.

The Super Cruise will be available on in the second half of 2016. GM is also partnering with Ford Motor Co., the University of Michigan, and the Michigan Department of Transportation to build 120-miles of 'intelligent highways' in Detroit. The roads will be able to communicate with vehicles and warn of upcoming hazards using sensors and cameras. GM officials promise any information gathered by the sensors will not be given to police to ticket drivers, and the Michigan Department of Transportation is calling it 'the largest deployment of connected vehicle and highway technology in the world.' GM also partnering with University of Michigan and Michigan Department of Transportation to build 'intelligent' roads around Detroit that capture and transmit traffic information using cameras and sensors . It's uncertain when the project will be completed. The vehicle-to-vehicle communication protocols are being developed in conjuction with the NHTSA. That's the same organization that's overseen GM's record 29 million recalls this year. However industry analysts note that some buyers will worry about the car's safety features, especially after GM produced faulty ignition switches linked to 13 deaths. 'There is still a concern by consumers about the safety of . their vehicles because there’s been so many recalls,' said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with AutoTrader. 'This is going to take a while to win the confidence of . consumers.' Barra tells reporters she knows the technology must be perfect to be a success. 'It’s critical that it works flawlessly every single . time,' Barra told reporters.

If GM, or any of the automakers competing to get the first self-driving car to consumers, can get the technology bug-free they might lower traffic fatalities and reduce gridlock. In the U.S. alone, the cost of economic and social impact of car crashes is more than $870 billion annually, GM stated, citing figures from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 'It’s a chicken-and-egg technology,' said John Capp, GM’s . director of global safety strategies and vehicle programs.

"Frightened toddlers were locked alone in a classroom storage closet by teachers as part of a lesson on ‘how to survive’, it has been claimed. Security video allegedly shows day-care teacher Shandra Fallen and her assistant Amellia Samuda leading two-year-olds into a closet at Pinocchio Children’s Palace in Brooklyn, New York. The teachers were found out  when the owner of the unit, Tatiana Ilyaich,  heard sobbing coming from the classroom, in June. Security video allegedly shows day-care teacher Shandra Fallen and her assistant Amellia Samuda leading two-year-olds into a closet at Pinocchio Children’s Palace, pictured, in Brooklyn, New York . When she investigated she saw a terrified youngster inside the closet - before the teachers ‘started laughing’. After scouring video footage for similar incidents, she informed parents, alerted the authorities and then sacked the duo the following business day. According to the New York Post, the Administration for Children’s Services and the city Health Department investigated the matter. The owner of the unit, Tatiana Ilyaich, said she discovered the activity in June after she heard sobbing coming from the classroom. An image of the interior of the day centre is pictured above . When Ms Fallen, 25, was applying for unemployment, she allegedly told Labor Department officials that it was a ‘kind of a game, that they were teaching [the children] how to survive if they are by themselves,’ Tatiana Ilyaich told the newspaper. The report says footage taken in May at the day care in East Flatbush showed Ms Fallen shutting one child into the supply closet and leaving him for three minutes before allowing him out. A two-year-old is then seen being ushered into the room and left for seven minutes. At that point Ms Fallen enters the closet and comes out after a minute leaving the child inside, the report says. Ms Samuda does the same shortly afterwards, it is claimed, and in total the youngster stays in the closet for ten minutes, according to the newspaper. After scouring video footage for similar incidents, the owner of the centre said she informed parents, alerted the authorities and then sacked the two teachers the following business day . Footage taken in May allegedly shows children at the day care being shut in a supply closet . The child’s mother is understood to be suing Pinocchio, Ms Fallen and Ms Samuda at Brooklyn Supreme Court. It adds that neither Brooklyn’s DA nor the NYPD had a record of the case. The pair are believed to have started work at the centre in November and the owner said there had been no prior problems with either of them. The New York Post quotes Ms Fallen’s lawyer as denying all wrongdoing and that they had not seen the lawsuit. It says Ms Samuda, 34, did not return messages for a comment adding that the Health Department insisted it had ‘properly screened’ the pair.","Teacher locked frightened toddlers in classroom storage closet, it is claimed .

Truett Cathy, the founder of the U.S. fast food chain Chick-fil-A died on Monday aged 93 surrounded by family . The company, which operates from 1,800 locations in 40 U.S. states, is known for its mix of religion and business as well as its fried chicken sandwiches and waffle fries . Funeral plans had not yet been finalized. In 2012 the chicken sandwich chain made headlines when its . president Dan Cathy -- the founder's son -- made comments to . the Baptist Press citing 'prideful' supporters of same-sex . marriage and defending the company's support of 'the biblical . definition of the family unit.' The comments ignited a cultural firestorm, triggering . protests including 'kiss-ins' by same-sex couples outside some . stores, as well as support from social conservatives and fans of . its products. The Jim Henson Co. pulled its Muppet toys from kids' meals, while . politicians in Boston and Chicago told the chain it is not welcome . there. Chick-fil-A issued a statement saying its culture is 'to . treat every person with honor, dignity and respect - regardless . of their belief, creed, race, sexual orientation or gender.' S. Truett Cathy, a native of the U.S. state of Georgia and a . devout Southern Baptist, founded Chick-fil-A in 1967. The company, which operates from 1,800 locations in 40 U.S. states, is known for its mix of religion and business as well as . its fried chicken sandwiches and waffle fries. All locations are closed on Sundays to allow employees 'a . day for family, worship, fellowship or rest,' according to the . company's website. Over ensuing decades, the chain's boneless chicken sandwich he is credited with inventing would propel Chick-fil-A expansion to more than 1,800 outlets in 39 states and the nation's capital. Cathy's son's comments opposing same-sex marriage ignited a cultural firestorm, triggering protests including 'kiss-ins' by same-sex couples outside some stores, as well as support from social conservatives and fans of its products . By early 2013, the company says on its website, annual sales topped $5 billion as the chain offered up a taste of the South that went beyond chicken to such offerings as sweet tea, biscuits and gravy. Cathy's $6 billion fortune as the founder of Chick-fil-A puts him on the yearly Forbes magazine list of the wealthiest Americans in the country. The company has listed him on its website as its chairman emeritus after he left day-to-day operations to younger generations. Truett Cathy began his career in the restaurant business by opening with his brother in 1946 an Atlanta diner called The Dwarf Grill, which was named for the short and stout shape of the restaurant. He has attributed his hardworking nature — even as a little boy he made money by selling six bottles of Coca-Cola for a quarter — to growing up poor. 'I've experienced poverty and plenty and there's a lesson to be learned when you're brought up in poverty,' he said in 2007. 'I had to create some good work habits and attitude.' Cathy, seen here in 2008 with then President George W. Bush, received the Lifetime President's Volunteer Service Award . Even well into his 80s, Cathy was actively involved in the chain's operations, including setting up a contract with his children that said they may sell the privately-owned chain in the future but the company must never go public. 'Why would I retire from something I enjoy doing?' Cathy said in a 2007 interview. 'I can hardly wait to get here.' An opportunity in 1961 led to the development of the restaurant chain's trademark chicken sandwich when a company that cooked boneless, skinless chicken for airline meals wanted to sell him pieces that were too big for the airline customer's needs. Cathy took those pieces and cooked them in a pressure cooker and served them in buttered buns. The sandwich was sold at independent . restaurants for a few years before he opened his first Chick-fil-A . restaurant at an Atlanta shopping mall in 1967. Cathy . also was known for his efforts to help youth. In 1984 he created the . WinShape Foundation to help 'shape winners' through youth support . programs and scholarships. He also created a long-term program for foster children that has foster care homes in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Brazil. Cathy was also known for his kindness towards children, starting a program for foster children and supporting scholarship and youth programs . His sympathy for children was demonstrated in August 2008 when he worked out a deal with the parents of two girls who were accused of causing $30,000 in damage to a home he owned in New Smyrna Beach, Florida. The girls were banned from watching TV and playing video games. They also had to write 'I will not vandalize other people's property' 1,000 times. He told the Daytona Beach News-Journal that he didn't want to have them prosecuted and left with a criminal record. As the author of several books, his 2007 book 'How Did You Do It, Truett?' outlined his strategy for success that included setting priorities, being courteous, cautiously expanding a business and not being burdened with debt. 'There's really no secret for success,' he said then. 'I hope it will open eyes for people. They don't have to follow my recipe but this is what works for me.'","Founded the restaurant chain which now has 1,800 locations in 1967 .

"Following a botched execution earlier this year, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections announced today it would be renovating the state's death chamber. The biggest change is a new vein-finder that would make administering lethal injections easier for staff. This all comes months after the troubled April 29 execution of Clayton Lockett, who writhed and moaned before he was declared dead 43 minutes after his execution began. Scroll down for video . Death chamber: The gurney in the execution chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary is pictured in McAlester, Okla. A report issued last week blamed Lockett's flawed lethal injection on poor placement of intravenous lines, as the medical team could not find suitable veins in his arms, legs, neck and feet. Botched death: The execution of Clayton Lockett was plagued with problems as a viable vein could not be found. Eventually, a line was inserted into his groin. Ultimately, it was decided to insert the line into his groin. The execution was halted when prison officials noted the lethal injection drugs weren't being administered properly, with the doctor inside the death chamber reporting a single IV in Lockett's groin had became dislodged, and the lethal drugs were going into his tissue and leaking out of his body. This new device will make it easier for those administering injections to find viable veins. 'We are working hundreds of hours since that execution on rewriting this protocol,' said Oklahoma Corrections director Robert Patton, according to The Guardian. 'We’ve reached out to several states around us and we’ve tried to take best practices from all the states that will talk to us. And I’m very confident moving forward in the process of executing inmates in the state of Oklahoma.' Patton also said that upgrades to the death chamber will include new communication devices so government officials can know what's going on. A four-time felon, Lockett was convicted of shooting 19-year-old Stephanie Nieman  and then watching as two accomplices buried her alive in Kay County, Oklahoma in 1999. She and a friend had walked in on the men robbing a home.

Shocking: Facebook has refused to remove a video of a kitten being doused in petrol and set on fire because it says that the footage does not breach any of the social network's rules . When  user Kieran Dunwel reported the footage for containing graphic violence, he was told that Facebook had reviewed the video before ruling it did not breach the site's 'community standards'. 'I was going through Facebook and I saw this video,' said the 23-year-old from Tilbury, Essex. 'I clicked on it, watched it and I was disgusted. 'I reported it to Facebook, it took five or six hours for them to get back to me, and they said it was perfectly fine to have it on there. 'It made me feel sick, I was angry, I tried to find a phone number to speak to them but I couldn't. I was outraged.' The video shows liquid, understood to be petrol, being poured over the kitten as it lies in a bucket before the liquid is set alight. Torture: In the shocking clip, two men can be seen apparently torturing a young kitten by stuffing it into a bucket, pouring flammable liquid over the animal and setting it on fire . The kitten manages to tip the bucket over and free itself, and attempts to run away in a ball of flames. As the cat rolls on the floor to try to extinguish the fire, more liquid is poured over it, while the men stand and watch. One then nudges the barely moving kitten with his foot, while the other tips the rest of the liquid over the animal. Response: After reporting the video, which was not thought to have uploaded by either of the men in the video, and carries a warning message, Mr Dunwel was told the video would not be removed . After the flames are finally put out, the camera zooms in on the helpless animal as it gasps for air, before the clip ends with the sight of a plastic bag being put over it. 'My mum is a cat person and it would have killed her to see that,' said Mr Dunwel. 'I'm a cat person, I've got two cats. This is just a kitten, it must only be about five or six weeks old and it has been brutally murdered.' After reporting the video, which was not thought to have been uploaded by either of the men seen in the film, and carries a warning message, Mr Dunwel was told the video would not be removed. In the response to Mr Dunwel, Facebook said: 'Thank you for taking the time to report something that you feel may violate our Community Standards. 'Graphic or violent content':  Last month former soldier Andy Reid, 37, who lost both legs and an arm while serving in Afghanistan has called Facebook 'harsh and narrow-minded' after they removed a picture of one of his stumps because it was 'offensive'. The former Corporal from St Helens, Merseyside, posted the picture of his stump with the caption 'hard work on the legs today'. But it was taken down by the social media's site communities team after a user complained about it. Facebook removed this picture (right) posted by triple amputee Andy Reid (pictured with wife Claire and son William) of his stump, because a user complained it was 'offensive' Until October last year, beheading videos were removed by Facebook but the site  changed its policy allowing them to stay online, as long as they were not glorifying the violence and used to raise awareness or condemn the action being shown. However, breaking these guidelines can lead to a lifetime ban. 'Nudity': In July, professional photographer Jill White was suspended from Facebook after she posted a photograph of her daughter Willa, two, on the beach - which the site labelled 'pornographic'. Mrs White, from North Carolina, said that she fell foul of Facebook's notoriously strict guidelines on posting nude pictures of children after they received a complaint about her innocent recreation of the famous 'Coppertone girl' pose from the 1950s ad campaign, which showed Willa's swimming costume being pulled down. She replaced that picture with a version that has a smiley face 'emoji' over her backside, which Facebook said meets their terms and conditions. Suspended: Professional photographer Jill White was suspended from Facebook after she posted a photograph of her daughter Willa, two, on the beach. She later added the emoji graphic. Facebook has a strict policy against sharing pornography, and any explicit sexual content including a child. Users who have posted pictures of their children naked or semi-clothed have been banned from the site. Facebook says it does 'aspire to respect people’s right to share content of personal importance', including pictures of breast feeding, and lifted a blanket ban on such images in June following the high profile 'Free The Nipple' campaign. 'Users with false names': In the run up to the 2011 Royal Wedding, Facebook pages set up by anti-austerity protesters, including UK Uncut, were disabled. However, Facebook said the profiles were suspended not for political reasons, but because they had not been correctly registered. The Facebook community standards state that 'claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organisation, or creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Facebook's terms.' 'Reports like yours are an important part of making Facebook a safe and welcoming environment. 'We reviewed the video you reported for containing graphic violence and found it doesn't violate our community standards.' A Facebook spokesman told MailOnline that the clip had been reviewed and was deemed to have met the guidelines. She said: 'People come to Facebook to share experiences of the world around them and on occasion this may result in the sharing of content that some may find upsetting. 'While we do not allow content that directly encourages violence, we try to create a safe environment that balances people's desire to express themselves and in some cases condemn what they see.' Facebook's community standards say that graphic videos are shared on the site as a means of condemning the violence depicted, and raise awareness of instances of animal cruelty or atrocities committed worldwide. They state: 'Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences and raise awareness about issues important to them. Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve graphic content that is of public interest or concern, such as human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share this type of content, it is to condemn it. However, graphic images shared for sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our site. 'When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible manner. That includes choosing carefully the audience for the content. For graphic videos, people should warn their audience about the nature of the content in the video so that their audience can make an informed choice about whether to watch it.' This video had been shared with a message posted first in Spanish, and then translated into English, reading: 'Sad, no one gives heart to see that pain comes to the cruelty of human.' It adds: Please only watch if strong heart.'","Clip shows men pouring flammable liquid onto a cat as it lies in a bucket .

American companies, especially big ones, were showing some signs of recovering their competitive edge on the world stage since the financial crisis, but workers are continuing to struggle to demand better pay and benefits, according to the study, titled, 'An Economy Doing Half its Job'. The report focuses on this 'troubling divergence' between the rally at large and mid-size firms and the challenge smaller companies and middle- and working-class Americans are having keeping up. This graph from the Harvard study shows almost half of respondents to its survey forecast falling competitiveness over the coming three years . Although a plurality of respondents remain pessimistic about the US' prospects, the percentage has dropped significantly from recent surveys . Overall the survey showed improvement in every measure of the US business environment from prior years . 'We argue that such a divergence is unsustainable,' lead authors Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin write in the report, which was based on a survey of 1,947 of . Harvard Business School alumni around the globe, and which . highlighted problems with the US education system, transport . infrastructure and the effectiveness of the political system. 'How can we create a US economy in which firms both thrive in global competition and lift the living standards of the average America?' the study's authors ask in the executive summary. Some 47 per cent of respondents in the survey said that overthe next three years they expected US companies to be bothless competitive internationally and less able to pay higherwages and benefits, versus 33 per cent who thought the opposite. That contrasts with the more troubling trends in the labor market and among middle- and working-class Americans . The job market for younger Americans is particularly troubled, with the share of 'mal-employed' college graduates soaring in recent years . The results marked an improvement from a 2012 Harvard . Business School survey of its alumni showing 58 per cent of . respondents expecting a decline in US competitiveness, . according to the survey. In K-12 education, business is mostly involved in fragmented, subscale efforts that alleviate weaknesses in the system without strengthening it for the long run. In workplace skills, firms tend to hire in ways that discourage skills investments; information flows poorly along the 'supply chain' for talent; and there is inadequate collaboration among companies, educational institutions and government. In transportation infrastructure, there is no national strategy for increasing both the nation's mobility and the opportunity that accompanies it. The change from 2011 was even more stark, when 71 per cent forecast a decline. Respondents were more favorable in every element of the US business environment, reflecting the cyclical rebound of the economy, the authors said. Smaller gains were seen in areas that pose 'some of the nation's toughest challenges', including the tax code, the education system, the political system and regulations. But the authors of the Harvard survey noted that respondents of the 2014 survey 'were much . more hopeful about the future competitive success of America's . firms than they were about the future pay of America's workers'. Alumni reported weakness in areas that drive the prospects of middle- and working-class Americans, such as in education, the quality of workplace skills and the effectiveness of the political system. Household incomes in the lower and middle classes have remained stagnant in inflation-adjusted terms for decades, while private sector job growth rates are subdued, the authors said. This chart shows the areas where the US is seen as improving relative to other advanced economies and areas where its standing is deteriorating, and how it's changed from prior surveys . They called on corporate leaders to help solve America's . wealth gap by working to buttress the kindergarten-to-12th-grade . education system, skills-training programs, and transportation . infrastructure, among other things. 'Shortsighted executives may be satisfied with an American . economy whose firms win in global markets without lifting US living standards. But any leader with a long view understands . that business has a profound stake in the prosperity of the . average American,' according to the report. 'Thriving citizens become more productive employees, more . willing consumers, and stronger supporters of pro-business . policies,' it said. 'Struggling citizens are disgruntled at . work, frugal at the cash register, and anti-business at the . ballot box.' The study highlights the US economy's slow recovery, record corporate profits and the growing confidence among business leaders. The authors noted, however, that American's international competitiveness is linked to high and rising living standards among average citizens. If they fall, then so too will the US' place in the world. 'But oddly, the recovery makes this a decisive moment, and potentially a dangerous one,' the authors said. 'Will we as a society now sigh in relief and continue business as usual, grateful for calmer waters? Or will we seize the opportunity to repair the structural weaknesses in our economy that the storms revealed and that, arguably, brought on recent troubles and may bring them on again?'","Large US companies are recovering from the Great Recession, while smaller firms and workers continued to struggle, according to a Harvard Business School study .

"These pictures may look like an attractive woman in her 20s and her grandmother. But they are said to be the same person – apparently taken just days apart. The young Vietnamese woman at the centre of the improbable medical case, Nguyen Thi Phuong, claims the transformation may have come about because of an extreme allergy to seafood. Nguyen, 26, says she developed this puffy face and sagging skin in 2008 but was too poor to seek treatment. Earlier this month, doctors said they would examine her free of charge. Nguyen’s husband, carpenter Thanh Tuyen, insists the story is true and his love has not faded for his once-beautiful wife. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rapid ageing: A mystery condition has apparently caused Nguyen Thi Phuong's face to sag and wrinkle over a matter of day. She is pictured aged 21 on the left and 26 on the right . She has always worn wear a mask in . public to hide her appearance from prying eyes, but she has now sought help from doctors to see if they can reverse the 'ageing' effect. Displaying photos of a beautiful . 21-year-old woman on her wedding day in 2006, Mrs Nguyen said: 'Five years . ago, I was rather pretty and not so ugly like this, right?' Mrs Nguyen believes her condition was caused by a life-long allergy to seafood. She said she had suffered a particularly bad reaction in 2008. 'I was really itchy all over . my body. I had to scratch even while sleeping.' Phuong said she took . some medicine bought at a local pharmacy instead of going to the . hospital because her and her husband Tuyen, now 33, were too poor to . afford it. She said: 'After one month of taking the drugs, I became less itchy but hives remained on my skin. Then I switched to traditional medicine . and all the hives disappeared, together with my itching. However, my . skin began to sag and fold.' Mrs Nguyen then took another kind of . traditional medicine to treat her rapid-aging skin problem - but to no . avail. Doctors say it may have been the long-term use of traditional medicines that caused the condition as they are often spiked with corticoids. These steroids speed up the effects of the unregulated remedies but could also have triggered the rare skin disease mastocytosis, where the body produces too many mast cells. The couple do not remember what the medicine was or which pharmacy they got it from. Our love hasn't faded: Tuven (pictured) said he still loved his wife but they hadn't had children as their lives were too difficult . Mrs Nguyen said: 'We considered that it was . our destiny and I quit treatment in 2009. Now I always wear a face mask . whenever I go out. 'The skin on my face, chest and belly . have folds like an old woman who has given birth several times although I . have never had a child. 'But the rapid-aging syndrome hasn't affected . my menstrual cycle, hair, teeth, eyes and mind.' In 2010, the couple . migrated to the southern province of Binh Phuoc's Bu Dop District where . they rent a small wooden house. It could be.... Lipodystrophy . This is a rare syndrome which causes a layer of fatty tissue beneath the surface of the skin to disintegrate while the skin itself continues to grow at a startling pace . It has no cure and leaves victims with loose folds of skin on their bodies as well as wrinkled faces and features of people much hold. Only 2,000 people are thought to have the condition . Or it might be.... Cushing’s Syndrome . This can be triggered if a person has very high levels of a hormone called cortisol in their blood. Common symptoms include weight gain, rounding of the face due to deposits of fat developing there and thinning of the skin. It often occurs as a side effect of treatment with corticosteroids. Women are five times more likely to develop endogenous Cushing’s syndrome than men, with most cases affecting people who are 25 to 40 years old. Mr Nguyen continued to work as a carpenter . while Phuong got a job at a cashew-nut processing factory.  Both earn a . total of less than £92 a month - which means they cannot . afford an examination at a major hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. Tuyen said his wife's disease has not affected his love for her or their relationship. He said: 'I married Phuong when she was a . beautiful woman. I have followed her through her disease and have never . been shocked at all. 'It's not easy to talk about one's own . marital affairs. Just simply understand that I still love her very . much.' Mrs Nguyen said her husband's love is the reason she is able to . persevere in the face of adversity. She said: 'He still loves me like before . despite the fact that I look old and ugly. With him, I feel more . confident to live and work.' On October 2, doctors from Nguyen Dinh . Chieu Hospital in Ben Tre Province said they would examine Phuong for . free and send her to the HCMC Dermatology Hospital if they failed to . diagnose her condition. There is already some disagreement among doctors over the cause of the rare condition. Doctor Vo Thi Bach Suong of the HCMC University of Medicine and Pharmacy, said: 'She might have taken corticoid for a . long time. Many traditional pharmacists use corticoid in their medicine, . leading to side effects like swelled face and abnormally-growing skin . sections.' Nguyen Hoai Nam, another lecturer at the university, agreed that Phuong may suffer from the wrongful use of corticoid. He said: 'A sudden stop in using . corticoid could easily lead to Cushing's Syndrome, which is clearly seen . through affected skin.' However, doctor Huynh Huy Hoang of . the HCMC Dermatology Hospital has doubts over this diagnosis. He said: 'It's really strange. This is . the first time I've heard of such a case of rapid-aging process on an . adult. It's not lipodystropy syndrome. 'However, aging is not a common sign of Cushing's Syndrome either.' Doctor Yen Lam Phuc of the Vietnam . Military Medical Academy agreed with Hoang, saying the rapid aging could . not be a side effect of a medical substance.  He said: 'It could be a . totally new syndrome.' Meanwhile Tuyen said that he and his wife do not dare to have a child, even though they have been married several years, because their lives are so difficult. He said: 'Our only wish is to have some philanthropists or doctors help my wife to make her normal face again.' Doctor Hoang Van Minh from the Ho Chi Minh City Medicine and Pharmacy University Hospital claims Phuong, could regain some of her previous beauty with medical treatment. Dr Hoang visited Phuong this week at her house in the Mekong Delta province of Ben Tre where he said it was likely she did have mastocytosis. He said Phuong's face still swells and she is itchy with frequent diarrhoea, which are common signs of the disease. There is currently no cure but there are many medicines to help treat its symptoms. 'She needs to be treated for her allergies first,' Dr Hoang said. He added that his treatment plan could restore between 50-70 percent of her skin to normal and laser therapy could reduce the folds. Dr Hoang said there should be more tests to verify his initial diagnosis and find any other diseases she might have.",Doctors speculate Nguyen Thi Phuong may have entirely new syndrome .

"Would Parmesan by any other name be as tasty atop your pasta? A ripening trade battle might put that to the test. As . part of trade talks, the European Union wants to ban the use of . European names like Parmesan, feta and Gorgonzola on cheese made in the . United States. The argument is that the American-made cheeses are . shadows of the original European varieties and cut into sales and . identity of the European cheeses. The Europeans say Parmesan should only . come from Parma, Italy, not those familiar green cylinders that . American companies sell. Feta should only be from Greece, even though . feta isn't a place. The EU argues it ‘is so closely connected to Greece . as to be identified as an inherently Greek product.’ By any other name...: As part of free trade talks, the European Union is expected to propose to ban the United States from using certain European cheese names if the cheese is made here . So, a little ‘hard-grated cheese’ for your pasta? It doesn't have quite the same ring as Parmesan. U.S. dairy producers, cheesemakers and food companies are all fighting the idea, which they say would hurt the $4 billion domestic cheese industry and endlessly confuse consumers. ‘It's really stunning that the Europeans are trying to claw back products made popular in other countries,’ says Jim Mulhern, president of the National Milk Producers Federation, which represents U.S. dairy farmers. The European Union would not say exactly what it is proposing or even whether it will be discussed this week as a new round of talks on an EU-United States free trade agreement opens in Brussels. European Commission spokesman Roger Waite would only say that the question ‘is an important issue for the EU.’ That's clear from recent agreements . with Canada and Central America, where certain cheese names were . restricted unless the cheese came from Europe. Under the Canadian . agreement, for example, new feta products manufactured in Canada can . only be marketed as feta-like or feta-style, and they can't use Greek . letters or other symbols that evoke Greece. It's Greek to me: Despite not being named for a specific place, the EU included feta cheese on its list of products they'd like renamed if produced in the United States . Though . they have not laid out a public proposal, the EU is expected to make . similar attempts to restrict marketing of U.S.-made cheeses, possibly . including Parmesan, Asiago, Gorgonzola, feta, fontina, grana, Muenster, . Neufchatel and Romano. And . it may not be just cheese. Other products could include bologna, Black . Forest ham, Greek yogurt, Valencia oranges and prosciutto, among other . foods. The trade . negotiations are important for the EU as Europe has tried to protect its . share of agricultural exports and pull itself out of recession. The . ability to exclusively sell some of the continent's most famous and . traditional products would prevent others from cutting into those . markets. Concerned about the . possible impact of changing the label on those popular foods, a . bipartisan group of 55 senators wrote U.S. Trade Representative Michael . Froman and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack this week asking them not . to agree to any such proposals by the EU. Led . by New York Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Pennsylvania Sen. Patrick . Toomey, R-Pa., the members wrote that in the states they represent, . ‘many small- or medium-sized, family owned businesses could have their . businesses unfairly restricted’ and that export businesses could be . gravely hurt. Schumer said artisanal cheese production is a growing industry across New York. ‘Muenster is Muenster, no matter how you slice it,’ he said. Trevor . Kinkaid, a spokesman for the U.S. trade representative, said . conversations on the issue are in the early stages but that the U.S. and . E.U. have ‘different points of view’ on the topic. The . agency wouldn't disclose details of the negotiations, but Kinkaid said . the U.S. government is ‘committed to increasing opportunity for U.S. businesses, farmers and workers through trade.’ Large . food companies that mass-produce the cheeses are also fighting the . idea. Kraft, closely identified with its grated Parmesan cheese, says . the cheese names have long been considered generic in the United States. ‘Such restrictions could not only be costly to food makers, but also potentially confusing for consumers if the labels of their favorite products using these generic names were required to change,’ says Kraft spokesman Basil Maglaris. Feeling bleu: Gorgonzola was also among the cheeses whose names the EU covets . Some producers say they are incensed because it was Europeans who originally brought the cheeses here, and the American companies have made them more popular and profitable in a huge market. Errico Auricchio, president of the Green Bay, Wisconsin, company BelGioioso Cheese Inc., produced cheese with his family in Italy until he brought his trade to the United States in 1979. ‘We have invested years and years making these cheeses,’ Auricchio says. ‘You cannot stop the spreading of culture, especially in the global economy.’ He says that companies who make certain cheeses would have to come together and figure out new names for them, which would be almost impossible to do. His suggestion for Parmesan? ‘I Can't Believe It's Not Parmesan,’ he jokes. Jaime Castaneda works for the U.S. Dairy Export Council and is the director of a group formed to fight the EU changes, the Consortium for Common Food Names. He says the idea that only great cheese can come from Europe ‘is just not the case anymore.’ He points out that artisanal and locally produced foods are more popular than ever here and says some consumers may actually prefer the American brands. European producers can still lay claim to more place-specific names, like Parmigiano-Reggiano, he says. ‘This is about rural America and jobs,’ he said.","The EU says American-made feta, gorgonzola, Parmesan and other products aren't fit to be called by their traditional names .
Similar demands could also be made over American-produced bologna, Black Forest ham, Greek yogurt, Valencia oranges and prosciutto ."
"Britain has begun arming the Kurds to fight back against ISIS, David Cameron revealed today. The Prime Minister told MPs, in a statement following last week’s Nato summit in Newport, that Britain ‘will continue to support the Kurds, including by providing them with arms and training their troops’. Until now the Government has limited itself to transporting weapons from former Soviet countries to the Kurds, for example from Albania. But Mr Cameron was asked if Britain will now be providing the Kurdish peshmerga militia directly with arms. The Prime Minister responded: ‘The short answer to that is yes.’ Britain has also offered to train the Kurdish fighters. A Kurdish Peshmerga fighter fires at Baretle village, which is controlled by the Islamic State, in Khazir, on the edge of Mosul today . The PM told MPs that he hoped the new Iraqi government would be formed later this week. Airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq will not be given the go-ahead until a new Iraqi government has been formed. Mr Cameron said Nato ‘was clear about the threat from Islamist extremism’. He said: ‘We agreed we must use all the instruments at our disposal - humanitarian, diplomatic and military - to squeeze this barbaric terrorist organisation out of existence.’ Mr Cameron also said Russia would be hit with fresh sanctions today over its military incursion into Ukraine. He said: ‘Nato sent a clear message to Russia that what President Putin is doing is illegal and indefensible. We stand firmly behind Ukraine's right to make its own decisions not to have them dictated by Russian soldiers trampling on Ukraine's sovereign soil. ‘We will continue our efforts to support Ukraine, including by providing financial assistance to improve their command, control and communication capabilities. ‘Today's new sanctions from the European Union will further ramp up the economic cost to Russia. The Prime Minister confirmed that Britain had begun arming the Kurds . ‘They will make it harder for its banks and its energy and defence companies to borrow money, they will widen the ban on selling so-called dual goods like machinery and computer equipment that could be used for military or civilian purposes.’ The Prime Minister outlined agreements on a new rapid reaction force, exercises in eastern Europe and spending commitments from Nato members. Mr Cameron said Nato members that were not meeting the obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defence had agreed to halt cuts in spending and increase it in real terms over the next decade. And he said new equipment would also be purchased - highlighting Britain's own decisions to invest in the ‘best and most modern military hardware money can buy’. The Prime Minister added: ‘After the end of the Cold War, Nato stood down its highest readiness force. At this summit we decided to reverse that decision and scale up our readiness to respond to any threat. ‘A new multinational spearhead force will be formed and will be deployable anywhere in the world within two to five days - this is vital in underlining our article five obligations to collective defence, and the UK will support this by providing a brigade and battle headquarters.’ Replying to the statement, Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘This Nato summit was the most important for a generation. ‘Today, Nato faces the gravest challenges in Europe, the Middle East and beyond since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the first Gulf War. ‘I commend Nato leaders for seizing the opportunity to put down firm markers on the key issues - Russia and Ukraine, Isil, and defence co-operation.’ Mr Miliband stressed the importance of Nato's defence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from potential Russian aggression.

"Prince Harry, pictured last month, was so taken with the Maritime inn in Brixham, Devon that he offered to buy it for £650,000 . Prince Harry was so taken with a Devon pub he visited during a stag weekend that he jokingly offered to pay the landlady £650,000 to buy the picturesque drinking hole. The royal had journeyed to the seaside town of Brixham in Devon for one of his friend's stag dos, with the group popping into the Maritime Inn for a few drinks.

'They were well behaved - they enjoyed themselves - they were drinking beer and spirits,' said Mrs Seddon. 'They stayed on one side of the bar - I made sure they weren't pestered. 'I didn't know they were turning up but I recognised Harry almost immediately. It was a surprise but if Prince Harry wants to come in my pub that's fine with me.

Judith Dennis, of the Refugee Council, . said the case was 'shocking' and called for the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to heed the report’s recommendations, which include that force should . only ever be used against pregnant women and children 'in order to . prevent harm'. The pregnant woman had been given a wheelchair to assist her in the departures area, said the inspectors. When she resisted, 'substantial force' was used by G4S staff and the wheelchair 'was tipped up with staff holding her feet'. 'At one point she slipped down from the chair and the risk of injury to the unborn child was significant,' the report said. 'There is no safe way to use force . against a pregnant woman, and to initiate it for the purpose of removal . is to take an unacceptable risk.' Botched operation: Private contractors G4S were responsible for the security fiasco at the Olympic Games, when the army had to be called in after the firm failed to recruit enough staff . Cedars has largely replaced Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre and families are offered . support by the children’s charity Barnardo’s while security is provided . by G4S. Nick Hardwick, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: 'We were very concerned to find that . force had been used to effect the removal of a pregnant woman, using . non-approved techniques. 'There is no safe way to do this while . protecting the unborn child and it is simply not acceptable to initiate . force for such purposes.' The pregnant woman’s husband had been disruptive the night before his family’s planned removal from Cedars, 'shouting and kicking doors, causing some damage', the report found. 'At one point it was judged that he had been trying to separate healthcare staff offering to examine his wife to take them hostage,' the report added. 'Staff were sufficiently concerned by his behaviour to take him to the ""cool down"" separation room in full personal protection equipment before his removal.' The so-called 'cool down' room was 'stark and not conducive to helping people calm down', the inspectors added. A G4S spokesman confirmed its staff were involved in incident.","Security guards used 'substantial force' on the woman .

"A mother-of-two who ballooned to 18st after she got hooked on takeaways has shed a third of her body weight for the sake of her children. Natalie Fowkes, 25, was bullied as a teenager because of her size. And when she left home aged 18 she piled on another four stone due to a takeaway addiction that saw her spend £15,000 over three years on fast food. At her heaviest Natalie weighed an unhealthy 18st, but falling pregnant was the motivation she needed to help turn around her life. Scroll down for video . Natalie Fowkes lost almost six stone after ditching her takeaway habit and joining Slimming World . When Natalie from Langley Mill, Derbyshire, discovered she was pregnant aged 21 she decided it was time to do something about her weight. Prompted by her own experiences of being called 'Fat Nat' by school bullies, Natalie joined Slimming World and eventually lost 6st to avoid her children being mocked about her appearance. Natalie, who now weighs 11st 9lb and is mother to Masie, 4, and Ollie, 15 months, said: 'I did not want the kids to say, ""Look at the state of your mum,"" Natalie's love of takeaways saw her spend £15,000 on fast food in three years . Her weight ballooned after she left ho,me aged 18 . 'I know how cruel kids can be, so I wanted help. 'I was terrible for takeaways and loved chips, crisps and full-fat Coca-Cola. 'My diet was disgusting and I'd eat anything I could get my hands on. 'I loved food so much, it was an addiction. 'People with a drug addiction get all the help in the world but I didn't get that. 'Food was my comfort. I hated being fat and I used to think: ""Why can't I just be thin?""' Now 11st 9lb Natalie now has so much more confidence she has even started her own Slimming World group to help other people lose weight . Natalie's diet consisted of fast food like McDonald's or Greggs for lunch followed by a pizza or kebab in the evening. Throughout high school Natalie was taunted with nicknames like 'beached Whale' and was constantly told she looked like a man. The  mother-of-two said: 'I was always the biggest in the class so people called me fat. 'I was called names constantly and, at the time. When I was single, I'd go out into town and people would say I looked disgusting and like a man. It was horrible and I'd cry all the time.' Natalie lost the weight using Slimming World programme after a friend recommended the company to her. After battling her nerves to go to the first meeting four years ago, Natalie was delighted as the weight started to budge. BREAKFAST: Three slices of white toast with chocolate spread, cup of tea, packet of biscuits . LUNCH: A McDonald's or Greggs super-sized cob with a full-fat cake . DINNER: Crispy chicken with a mountain of chips or a pizza or a kebab . BREAKFAST: Full English Slimming World breakfast with fruit and a yoghurt . LUNCH: Pasta or jacket potato . DINNER: Meat dish with vegetables and potatoes . She continued with the programme after the birth of her second child, Ollie, in June 2013, losing 12st 5lb just five days after he was born. She said: 'Slimming World has been my life. I can't begin to imagine what it would be like without it. 'I have so much more confidence. Four years ago, I would never have dreamed of showing off my legs.' Natalie has now started her own Slimming World group, to help other people lose weight. A Slimming World spokesperson says: 'Slimming World is the only national weight loss organisation that supports women to manage their weight through every stage of their pregnancy, from preconception to post-natally with the consent and on-going recommendation of their midwife or GP.

"A man accused of  holding a woman captive for two months and repeatedly raping her casually told his girlfriend's ex-husband, 'I've got a girl back here in a cage', the man has claimed. Ron Higgs, 61, was dumbfounded when he went to the Mount Vernon, Indiana trailer where Ricky House Jr., 37, and Kendra Tooley, 44, lived and saw their alleged slave, Joelle Lockwood. Lockwood, 30, who was forced to wear a collar and sleep in the cage, begged Higgs to help her escape and he managed to get her out of the home as House allegedly pointed a gun at him. After he drove Lockwood, who had been reported missing on July 9, back to his home last Friday, he immediately contacted authorities and the couple was promptly arrested. Nonchalant: Ricky Roy House Jr. is guided outside court following his not-guilty plea on Monday. He and his girlfriend are accused of keeping a 30-year-old woman captive in their home for two months . Emotional: His girlfriend Kendra Tooley, 44, hid her face as she was escorted out of court on Monday . 'My hat's off to him,' Posey County Sheriff Greg Oeth told TSHP about Higgs, who had been invited to the home because Tooley said they wanted to borrow money from him. 'I'm glad he did what he did. I'm glad he was in the situation he was and I'm glad he was able to get her out of that residence and get her back to the safety of her family.' On Monday, House and Tooley appeared in court wearing orange and white striped jumpsuits and bulletproof vests and pleaded not guilty to multiple charges. House was charged with four counts of rape, one count of conspiracy to commit rape, five counts of criminal confinement, two counts of kidnapping, one count of battery resulting in bodily injury and one count of pointing a firearm. Tooley was charged with two counts of rape, one count of conspiracy to commit rape, four counts of criminal confinement, two counts of kidnapping and one count of conspiracy to commit criminal confinement. Found: Joelle Lockwood, 30, vanished as she left a party on July 9 and on Friday, she was freed from the trailer where she had been held captive. She said she had been forced to stay inside a cage . Heroic: Ron Higgs, Tooley's ex-husband, helped free Lockwood after he visited the trailer last week . She covered her face and sobbed in the courtroom, while House showed little emotion, TSHP reported. Both are due back in court on October 1. Lockwood has since revealed terrifying details of her confinement during the two months her family were frantically searching for her. In July, she was drunk and walking back from a party when House, with whom she'd been at high school, offered to give her a ride. She went back to his trailer on his suggestion. But when there, he held her captive and bound her in several places, including 'an intricate restraint system attached to the bed', she told authorities. She said she was raped repeated while House used restraints, and authorities found ties including bungee cords and zip ties in the home, TSHP reported. At the home, she was also allegedly let out of the cage to perform chores while wearing a belt like a dog collar around her neck and naked from the waist down. According to police, Tooley has admitted to police that Lockwood was abducted and held, but House has so far refused to cooperate with authorities. Higgs said that he was telephoned by Tooley on Thursday because she needed money from him. Captivity: The victim was allegedly kept in this wooden cage at the couple's Indiana trailer . Locked up: Kendra Tooley and Ricky Roy House Jr. now face charges of confinement and rape . He said that when he arrived at the couple's trailer, House showed him Lockwood inside the cage. 'She had a t-shirt on, and that was it,' said Higgs to WFIE. 'She had a leather belt, like a dog collar on. Every night, they locked her in there. No food, no water.' Higg said that she was being made to cook and clean by House and Tooley and he initially thought she had agreed to the bizarre set-up. But on Friday, his second night in the trailer, Lockwood approached him and begged for help. 'That's when she told me on the second night with tears running down her eyes, 'please, do not leave here with out me,' said Higgs. 'And I promised her, if I have to give my life to get you out of here I will.' He then managed to get Lockwood out of the trailer, allegedly with guns trained on him, although Higgs has not clarified how he got the mother of two out as of Sunday. 'Everybody's calling me a hero,' said Higgs. 'I'm just a pure bred American, that I believe.' Joelle's mother, Candace said on Sunday that she is thrilled and exhausted to have her daughter home, while family friend, Amanda Crowe said that the family is still in shock. Please help: A missing poster with Joelle Ann Lockwood's photograph was put out to help the search for her . 'I just really want to say thank you to everyone who has supported us and has supported Joelle's family,' said Crowe. 'It means the world to all of us that the community has come out and has helped to find her.' Lockwood was last seen on July 9 leaving a party in Evansville, about 20 miles away. She was walking in the area of Park Street and Florida Street in Evansville and allegedly intoxicated. Authorities have also been exploring any possible connection between the Lockwood case and the August 15 disappearance of Kristy Kelley, 27, in Boonville, about 20 miles from Evansville, the Evansville Courier & Press reported last month. Evansville police did not mention the Kelley case in their statement and a spokesperson could not be reached for comment on Sunday. A dispatcher for the Warrick County Sheriff's Office said on Sunday that Kelley was still missing.","Joelle Lockwood, 30, was found alive in an Indiana trailer last Thursday - two months after she vanished while walking home after a party .

"A ball gown worn by the then Princess Elizabeth and gifted to a telephone operator  is now to be auctioned. The dress designed by influential fashion designer Norman Hartnell, the respected and official Royal Family clothier, is set to make a minimum of £25,000. Speaking to a 1961 issue of Woman's Own which featured the beautiful gown, Kathleen Ward, who worked at Buckingham Palace for six years, gives an extraordinary insight into the royal family before the coronation of the monarch. Scroll down for video . Queen of style: A luxurious pink silk ball gown worn in the 1940s by Queen Elizabeth and later gifted to a telephone operator working at Buckingham Palace at the time . In 1949, 18-year-old Kathleen applied for a job at Clarence House - the new home of the Princess and the Duke of Edinburgh. A few weeks after starting, Kathleen found herself sat in front of the future Queen, who was wearing a pale green wool dress, in her sitting room. Kathleen's candid recollection of her meeting Princess Elizabeth and subsequently securing a job as a telephone operator was published in a 1961 issue of Woman's Own. Royal approval: Queen Elizabeth II pictured meeting delegates and athletes on a visit to the Athlete's village during day one of the 20th Commonwealth Games on July 24, 2014, in Glasgow, Scotland . In the article, Kathleen said of her meeting: 'As soon as she looked at me, I could see the doubt in the Princess's eyes. 'She had expected a middle-aged woman, and was obviously astonished to see a young girl. 'She asked me whether I felt capable of managing a switchboard. ''You see,' she told me, 'I look upon the job of telephonist as one of great importance, for it is often the first impression, people have of Clarence House.' 'Then, the question I had been hoping to avoid - my age. With all the dignity I could muster, I replied: 'Nearly 19, your Highness. 'I remember flushing, for I was a good nine months off 19.' Fairy tale job: Kathleen Ward candid recollection of her meeting Princess Elizabeth and subsequently securing a job as a telephone operator was published in June 17, 1961 issue of Woman's Own . The future Queen of England replied, 'you are rather young' and Kathleen says she left believing she had not been successful in her regal interview. But she received a letter from General Sir Frederick Browning, the Comptroller at Clarence House, and husband of author Daphne Du Maurier, saying she would join the staff.

Later, Kathleen said she received a telephone call to go to to see 'Miss MacDonald' and she says she 'hurried to her room'. Kathleen told the magazine: 'Laid out for me to try were three dresses which belonged to Princess Elizabeth.

The telephone operator left her post in spring 1956 because the telephone operating system at Clarence House was to be operated by the General Post Office. On her last day, by which time Elizabeth had become Queen, she was given a send-off by the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret 'wearing a brown taffeta dress and smiling'.

'Then she gave me an invitation I shall always remember: 'It has been nice to know you, do come and see us again sometime.' Speaking about the gown, which measures 17' on the chest and a slim 12' on the waist, she added: 'I remember it when I look at the pink ball gown hanging in my wardrobe.'

"Ian Poulter is hopeful he is beginning to put his 'horrendous' year behind him and play himself onto Europe's Ryder Cup team after a strong opening round at the Deutsche Bank Championship. The Englishman has toiled through the season with shoulder, back and wrist injuries and, after starting his campaign with three top-10s on the PGA Tour, has only been able to record one more since. Poulter has also not recorded any top-10s on the European Tour this season and that has left him on the outside looking in and requiring one of Paul McGinley's captain's picks to make it onto the team for Gleneagles next month. Form: Ian Poulter is four shots off leader Ryan Palmer after his first round at the Deutsche Bank Championship . Needs to perform: Poulter will be desperate to play well to force his way into a Ryder Cup wildcard spot . Integral: The Englishman, pictured here after the 2012 win, has won 12 of his 15 previous Ryder Cup clashes . But an opening 67 in Boston will have certainly caught the Irishman's eye, with Poulter sitting just four shots behind first-round leader Ryan Palmer. Luke Donald will also be hoping for a good week as he too is relying on a wildcard and the 36-year-old began his tournament with a steady two-under 69. McGinley makes his choices on Tuesday with Stephen Gallacher still in with a chance of playing his way onto the team, and displacing Graeme McDowell in the process, with a top-two finish at the Italian Open. In contention: Luke Donald is one of the candidates vying with Poulter for a Ryder Cup wildcard at Gleneagles . McGinley's choices look to come down to three of Gallacher, McDowell, Poulter, Donald, Lee Westwood and Francesco Molinari. But Poulter, who has won 12 of his 15 previous Ryder Cup clashes, was a talisman during Europe's win at Medinah in 2012 and finally feels his game, and his fitness, is coming together. 'I'm feeling pretty good I just shot four under,' he told Sky Sports 4 following his round. 'I feel my body is holding up well, I feel the work I've done in the last six weeks has been really really good. 'I'm coming into, I would say, a bit of form at the right time to try and press on this week and then have a couple of good weeks to finish and then keep my fingers crossed and see what happens for the Ryder Cup. Choices: US captain Tom Watson and European counterpart Paul McGinley will name wildcards on Tuesday . 'It's been a horrendous year for injuries. I've been forced to take time off because I can't practise as hard as I've wanted to. 'And that's not good because I like to get out there, I like to have fun on the golf course and I like to work hard and I haven't been able to do that this year until now. 'I'm putting the reps in now, I'm feeling good, the body is feeling a lot better than it was in the middle part of the season and hopefully we can finish the second part of this season real strong.' Away from the race to Gleneagles is the small matter of the second tournament in the FedEx Cup play-offs, with Palmer holding a two-shot lead over fellow American Keegan Bradley. Bradley, who is a likely pick for the United States team in Scotland due to his successful partnership with Phil Mickelson, set the pace amongst the early starters but Palmer overtook him with a stunning 63. Early leader: Ryan Palmer has stormed to the top of the Deutsche Bank Championship leaderboard on day one . Starting on the back nine, the 37-year-old bogeyed the first but then birdied six of his next eight, including a run of four from 15 to 18, to turn in 35. Birdies on two, five and nine followed to send Palmer to the top of the leaderboard. Bradley's 65 left him on his own in second, one shot clear of fellow Americans Webb Simpson and Chesson Hadley and Australian Jason Day. Poulter was joined at four under by Swede Carl Petterson, Scot Russell Knox and Americans Bill Haas and Jordan Spieth. World number one Rory McIlroy was one under after a 70 containing five birdies and four bogeys while FedEx Cup leader Hunter Mahan struggled to a two-over 73. The top 70 in the FedEx Cup rankings after the Deutsche Bank Championship will advance to next week's BMW Championship, with the overall winner taking home a 10million US dollar bonus.","The Englishman had a torrid season with shoulder, back and wrist injuries .

"Prince Harry proved once again that he's a royal action man when he got behind the wheel of a 4x4 and tackled a treacherous-looking assault course in Warwickshire yesterday. The action was part of the opening event of the Invictus Games, the Jaguar Land Rover Driving Challenge, which was eventually won by Australia. But before the competitors got going, Prince Harry, who later admitted that he's starting to feel old ahead of his 30th birthday, was driven around the track at breakneck speed, struggling up muddy hillocks and splashing through muddy pools. Scroll down for video . Vrooooom! Prince Harry looked thrilled as he took a spin in a white F-Type Jaguar sports car in Warwickshire . Nice wheels! The prince appeared to enjoy his close encounter with the gleaming white F-Type Jaguar . Earlier, he had turned his hand to . driving an altogether more sporty model in the shape of an F-Type Jaguar . and appeared to enjoy the experience - beaming broadly as he slid into . the driver's seat and sped off. Afterwards, he stopped to watch the teams in action and was seen grimacing as competitors slid around in the mud and, at one point, hit a bump with a judder. But he was all smiles when Team Australia took the first gold of the Invictus Games, smiling broadly as he presented Sarah Archibald and Matthew Taxis with their medals. It was disappointment for Team GB however, after Germany's Engin Imprammpasi and Jorn Peper took silver and John de Ruiter and Wesley van den Wildenberg from the Netherlands took bronze. On his way: Prince Harry speeds off in the F-Type Jaguar after telling journalists that he is starting to feel old . Muddy: But it was a drive of a different sort when he was whizzed around the muddy course in a Land Rover . Bumpy ride: The car carrying Prince Harry ploughs through a muddy puddle and up a steep bank . Speaking during the presentation ceremony, Prince Harry revealed that the Invictus Games were 'probably' the way he would celebrate his 30th birthday and admitted that he is starting to feel old. Asked about his upcoming birthday, he said: 'I’m slowly starting to feel old.' The royal also compared turning 30 to seeing a 30mph speed limit sign as you enter a village. He added: 'I don’t feel too old, I think I am always young at heart. Surrounding myself with these guys and girls does keep me young. They’re sharp-witted and their sense of humour is on it.' Harry, who has championed the games with the help of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, also said his position had helped make the inaugural event a popular one. 'I’m at the stage of my life now where over the last couple of years I have realised what a difference it can make,' he explained. Mucky: Despite the sunny weather, the Warwickshire course clearly hadn't dried out after last week's rain . Dramatic: Prince Harry winces as one of the Invictus Games drivers catches a wheel on a bump . 'Using the position to do good is something I have tried to do for many years of my life, but this is a classic example.' Speaking to journalists at the end of his visit, Harry said he had been humbled by the experience, and everyone else should be too. 'I think everyone should be humbled. The reaction I have seen today for all the organising committee has reminded us exactly why we have done this,' he said. 'It’s a hugely humbling experience to see them go through the process, which I have been lucky enough to see.' Asked whether some people might criticise that the Games could be seen as supporting war, Harry said: 'This is nothing to do with supporting war. 'The British public support the individuals. It’s about supporting these individuals who have signed up to serve their country and wherever it takes them.' Big day: Today's driving challenge was the first event of the Invictus Games, which start in earnest on Thursday . First winner: Harry presents the gold medal to Australia's Sarah Archibald and Matthew Taxis after the event . Winning ways: Harry with the Netherlands' bronze medalists, John de Ruiter and Wesley van den Wildenberg . He said the fear that people might forget about the soldiers suffering the effects of conflicts when they stopped hitting the headlines 'should be a fear for everybody'. 'At the end of the day, the people who have given all their money, whether it is £5, £1 or £2,000, they have basically invested in a group of individuals, a group of people, because they want to help.This is the result. 'We are going to see lives that have been changed by the way they have been injured, and then changed by this.' The driving challenge came after a day of . engagements to welcome Invictus Games competitors to London and an . unusually frank exchange with members of the media, to whom Harry . revealed that his step further away from the throne was 'great'. But a joyful Harry couldn't resist a joke at his brother's expense, quipping that he could not wait to see his older brother ‘suffer more’ by having to look after two children.

Another member of the royal family to speak of his joy at the news was Mike Tindall, husband of Harry's cousin Zara Phillips, who revealed that he only heard the news on the radio.

"Richie Ramsay would hate to be the man to deny fellow Scot Stephen Gallacher a place in the Ryder Cup, but admits he will have to look after his own interests first. Gallacher needs to finish in the top two in the Italian Open to dislodge Graeme McDowell from the final automatic qualifying place in Paul McGinley's European team for Gleneagles.

'Stevie is a fantastic player as he has shown to get into contention. He will perform on Sunday and I wish him the best in getting (the Ryder Cup place) but I have to accomplish my job of getting into the mix and picking up win number three.' Ramsay, who won the South African Open in 2010 and European Masters in 2012, added: 'It's a tough one because I know Stevie well and am down at Kingsfield a fair bit where he practises, which is about a mile from his house. 'It's a big, big ask for him but he has shown how good a player he is and if he did not qualify automatically he would be an asset to the team, not only because of his ball-striking but his attitude as well. His record at Gleneagles is impressive too.' Friends: Gallacher and Ramsay know each other well and both practise at Kingsfield quite often .

European captain Paul McGinley missed the cut in Turin but stayed to watch the final two rounds ahead of naming his three wild cards at Wentworth on Tuesday. Gallacher has said all week he just wanted to be in with a chance on Sunday and achieved that thanks to a round containing four birdies and one bogey. 'It keeps me in touching distance,' Gallacher said. 'The worst thing I could have done was open up a big gap which was insurmountable. I've not done that so a good day on Sunday and I am still right in there. I had about four lip-outs today but they went in on Friday and I holed a couple of good putts at the end so it evens itself out. 'It's all to play for. You never know what happens in this game and guys have won from further back than this. I'll just go out and try and get as many birdies as possible and see what happens. 'It's a tough week obviously. I have done my day job and done it well but it is a long week and will take a lot out of me mentally but I have two weeks off after this and one round to go, so will give it my best shot.

"A retired father-of-three who was left with a hole in his face after having a tumour removed says he is now able to go outside again after having reconstructive surgery. Donnie Fritts, 55, was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2003 and was told he would have to make a choice between his face or his life. After speaking with his wife, Sharon, Mr Fritts made the agonising decision to go ahead with the surgery which left him without a nose, upper lip, or palate. But now the former carpenter, from Georgia, has been able to kiss his wife for the first time in a decade after having a new face fitted, and says he now wants to take her out to dinner. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Donnie Fritts, 55, says he is able to go out for the first time in a decade after being fitted with a new face following surgery which saw his nose, upper lip and palate removed . After being given his upper lip back Mr Fritts says he has been able to kiss his wife for the first time in a decade and is looking forward to taking her out for a meal . In 2003 Mr Fritts was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer growing in his jaw which meant he had to choose between losing his life or his face . He said: ‘If you’ve ever had a bad dream that is what it is like, except you don’t wake up . ‘I would have to chew by pushing my fingers down on my bottom teeth which meant I was too embarrassed to dine out. ‘Kids would look at me sometimes, they’d look at me with fear then they'd run back to their mothers. I looked like a monster. ‘Now it’s incredible, Sharon and I can go out in public and for the first time in years people don’t look or point. ‘I can take her out to dinner and on dates I no longer feel like I need to be a recluse.’ Mr Fritts said at one point he was considering letting the cancer kill him because he couldn't bare the thought of life after the surgery, but his wife Sharon (pictured) refused to let him die . Mr Fritts wearing his first prosthetic face which was designed by a man who made disguises for the CIA. However, shortly after it was fitted it became infected and had to be removed . Mr Fritts, a father-of-three, married Sharon in 2000, six years after separating from his first wife. But just two years later, he started to notice unusual pains in his teeth. Then, one night as he tucked into his favourite meal of steak and chips he felt a worrying pain in his mouth. ‘I told Sharon it felt like my teeth were coming loose,’ he said. ‘It was really painful.’ The next day Mr Fritts saw a dentist who referred him to a doctor who thought it was simply a sinus infection and prescribed antibiotics. Despite the increasing pain and his teeth growing looser every day, a further 14 doctors gave the same diagnosis. It was only after a horrifying discovery in the spring of 2003 that Mr Fritts, from Georgia, U.S., was sent to a specialist who could tell him what was really wrong. Mrs Fritts said: ‘I knew it was something serious as Donnie's pain got worse and worse. Mr Fritts has since had further operations he has now been fitted with new teeth, upper lip and nose . As part of his new prosthetic, Mr Fritts had to have a metal cage fitted to his face in order to hold his nose, cheeks and lip in place . ‘He could no longer eat dinner because it was so painful for him to chew. 'Then one morning I heard a cry from the bathroom. Donnie was calling for me, he needed help. ‘His nose, which had been looking increasingly rashy, had become red raw. As he touched it with his finger blood and puss started pouring out. Mr Fritts said that after his operation he caught sight of himself in an X-ray machine and thought it was a ghost until he realised it was his own reflection . ‘He put his fingers inside and a huge lump of bloody flesh popped out and landed in the sink. He was in agony. The smell was horrific - like rotting meat. We were both in tears. ‘I'd had enough. We were going to demand to see a specialist who would get to the bottom of this.’ Mr and Mrs Fritts made their way to Atlanta where Mr Fritts was finally given a biopsy. His wife said: ‘The news was devastating. The doctor said Donnie had this aggressive cancer and if he didn't have loads of his face removed he would certainly die a terrible, painful death. ‘The cancer was so rare there have only been 26 recorded cases worldwide and it's more likely a person will be hit by lightning than get it. ‘I sat in shock as Donnie and the doctor shared a laugh about how Donnie had survived being hit by lightning twice - so he wasn't that surprised with the news. ‘Still we were both devastated, though it was at least a relief to know what was going on. ‘The doctor told us most of the face would have to go. He said “the cancer has gone right into the bone. We may need to take the nose, the mouth, teeth and both the eyes too”.’ Mr Fritts was in shock but only had a short time to make his decision. ‘I hit rock bottom,’ he said. ‘I was only 49 but I would never properly kiss my wife again. I'd never chew another meal, may not be able to talk, sing, work or even see. ‘I wasn't sure if life after surgery would even be worth living. I thought about just letting the cancer kill me. ‘But I knew Sharon wouldn't allow it. And I couldn't leave her on her own. I knew I had to do what I could to survive this.’ Sharon Fritts (left) who married Donnie in 2000, says he first complained of his teeth feeling loose before blood and pus started pouring from his nose one morning . After seeing a specialist, Mr Fritts was diagnosed with an ameloblastic carcinoma, a rare type of cancer that grows in the jaw. To date, only around 30 cases have been reported worldwide . Mr Fritts is pictured at home with a swollen nose. Doctors initially thought he was suffering from a sinus infection, before he was diagnosed with cancer . In August 2003 Mr Fritts underwent a 12-hour operation to remove three tumours that were threatening his life. He was given just a two per cent chance of surviving. Amazingly, the operation was a success but when Mr Fritts woke from the anaesthetic and saw his reflection he was horrified. Ameloblastic carcinomas are rare, cancerous tumours. They usually develop from the jaw. Symptoms usually include pain in the jaw and swelling around the jaw area. To date, only about 30 cases have been reported worldwide. The tumours tend to grow aggressively in the face but do not often spread to other organs. Treatment usually involves surgery and, sometimes, radiotherapy. Source: Radiation Oncology . He said: ‘I woke up in a blur and looked around. The good news was I still had my eyes and hadn't lost my vision. ‘The bad news was I looked hideous. I caught a glimpse of myself on a shiny part of an X-ray machine as I lay there and I actually pushed myself back as I was laying down, thinking I had seen a ghost or a monster. Then I realised it was me. Over the next six years Mr Fritts had to have another 35 operations to stabilise his face. He sometimes wore a dust mask in public to hide the hole and it broke his heart when he saw little children run to their parents in fear after seeing him. Mr Fritts became increasingly reclusive, so Sharon found a prosthetic expert who used to make disguises for CIA agents and got him to design a new face for Donnie. However, just a few weeks after having the face fitted, Mr Fritts contracted a bacterial infection which threatened to kill him a second time as it was so close to his brain. Luckily, after two weeks in intensive care, he beat the infection, but it left him back at square one, living with the large gap in his face. However, thanks to a new series of operations including fitting a metal cage to his face to hold the prosthetic in place, Mr Fritts has a new face. Donnie's story appears in a new series of Body Bizarre, September 11, 9pm on TLC . Mr Fritts pictured with parts of his old prosthetic face. After the old prosthetic caused his face to become infected, Mr Fritts nearly died a second time but recovered after days in intensive care . Mr Fritts said he used to wear a dust mask over his face in order to go out. But after children ran away from him in the street and shop workers made hurtful comments, he became a recluse .","Donnie Fritts, 55, diagnosed with rare cancer growing in his jaw in 2003 .

"Beheaded American journalist Steven Sotloff was not 'sold' to the Islamic State by Syrian rebels, the White House said on Tuesday. 'Based on the information that has been provided to me, I don't believe that is accurate,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters during his daily briefing. 'That information does not match the information that I’m currently aware of,' Earnest claimed, according to the Washington Examiner. The Obama administration official's statements contradict a claim made Monday night by Sotloff family spokesman Barak Barfi. Barfi told CNN's Anderson Cooper that 'sources on the ground' had confirmed Sotloff was kidnapped at the Syrian border and sold to ISIS for as much as $50,000. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday that Steven Sotloff was not sold to ISIS . Scroll down for video . A spokesman for Steven Sotloff's family had claimed on Monday that Syrian rebels sold his late friend to ISIS for as much as $50,000 . Barak Barfi also accused the White House of not doing enough to save the American journalist, who is pictured here on the day he was murdered . 'These so-called moderate rebels that people want us, our administration, to support, one of them sold him probably for something between $25,000 - $50,000,' he said, getting in a dig at other U.S. politicians in favor of backing Syrian rebels, including Republican Sen. John McCain and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. According to Barfi, Sotloff's name was wrongly included on a list of activists responsible for the bombing of a hospital. While at the border crossing, Barfi says, someone made a phone call to ISIS, and Sotloff was later apprehended at a fake check point. The White House said on Tuesday that 'there is a broad investigation into Mr. Sotloff’s death' still. 'We are determined to bring those responsible for his death to justice,' Earnest added. Barfi accused the White House on Monday of using the beheaded journalist as a ‘pawn’ and failing to do more to save him after he went missing in August of 2013. The Sotloff family spokesman said it ‘not true’ that the White House kept the families of Americans taken hostage in Syria ‘consistently and regularly informed’ and claimed that the family’s relationship with the White House was ‘strained’ even before their son was killed. 'We do not believe that they gave us the cooperation we need,' Barfi said. 'Once Steve appeared in that video, the Sotloff family made one simple request of the administration, and they were rebuffed on that.' On September 2, 2014, extremists affiliated with the Islamic State released an undated video of Sotloff being beheaded by a masked man. Government officials confirmed hours later that the man who was murdered in the video was indeed Sotloff. Sotloff is the second American journalist ISIS has murdered on camera. The first was James 'Jim' Foley, who was beheaded in an undated video released by ISIS in August. Fearing public outrage over the two atrocities, Obama administration officials told the press about a failed mission to rescue Sotloff and Foley. Barfi pushed back on Monday on administration officials' claims that the government did everything it could to save the two men and warned that the Sotloff family would have 'to speak out to set the record straight' if administration officials continued to 'leak' information to the press. 'We know that the intelligence community and the White House are [immersed] in a larger game of bureaucratic infighting and Jim and Steve are pawns in that game, and that's not fair,' he said. Barfi said it was inappropriate for the White House and Pentagon officials to be arguing publicly about the details of a failed mission to retrieve Americans being held hostage in Syria and said they should not be detailing how Foley was tortured before he was killed. 'That's just not fair to his family. They need time to heal,' he said. A mourner embraces Steven Sotloff's mother Shirley before entering a memorial service for deceased journalist on Friday at the Temple Beth Am in Pinecrest, Florida. Sotloff was executed by the Islamic State in a video the group released on September 2, 2014 . Barfi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Monday that it was ‘not true’ that the White House kept the Sotloff family ‘consistently and regularly informed’ The Sotloff family spokesman told Cooper he could not say what favor the Sotloffs had asked of the president before their own son was killed because he had to 'think about protecting the other hostages inside.' Suffice it to say 'the administration could have done more, they could have helped us, they could have seen them through,' Barfi claimed. 'These are people of modest means. They are not cosmopolitans. They don't have college educations. They don't understand the larger ramifications in foreign policy,' he continued. 'And we just do not believe that they were afforded the opportunities and respect that they should have by this administration.' Barfi said that in future hostage situations, the government needs to designate a senior administration official as the point of contact 'so that the families know there is someone to hold their hand all the time.'","Sotloff family spokesman Barak Barfi said Monday that Syrian rebels sold his late friend to ISIS for a much as $50,000 .

"Fight: A new biography of Emperor Hirohito claims he tried to stop his nation siding with the Nazis in 1939 . Japan's former emperor tried to stop his country siding with the Nazis in the lead-up to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, a new biography claims. Emperor Hirohito allegedly warned the attacks in July 1941 would cause 'nothing less than a self-destructive war'. And in the wake of the Second World War, he told US commanders he blamed himself for failing to stop it. The claims come from a 12,000-page account of the leader's life, which has taken 24 years and £2.2 million to compile at the cost of the Japanese taxpayer. It will be released in stages over the next five years, but some Japanese media outlets have been given advance extracts. The tome portrays a sympathetic view of Hirohito as a man who rallied against army leaders. He is remembered by some in Japan as a driving force in the nation's march to war with the Germans. Others, however, believe he was helpless to control a corrupt military state. The emperor's role in the war was never firmly established. He was shielded from indictment in the Tokyo war crimes trials by a US occupation that wanted to use him as a symbol to rebuild Japan . It claims he complained in July 1939 to Army Minister Seishiro Itagaki about the military's 'predisposition' as it strengthened its relationship with Germany, according to Japan's Kyodo news agency. Warning: The monarch allegedly warned the bombing of Pearl Harbor would cause a 'self-destructive war' Kyodo said it provides little new material and is unlikely to change current thinking about Hirohito. It does make public some letters and essays he wrote as a child. The record confirms that Hirohito said in 1988 that he had stopped visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine because it had added Class A war criminals to those enshrined there, Kyodo said. His last visit to Yasukuni was in 1975. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited the shrine last December, sparking official protests from China and South Korea.","Emperor Hirohito 'warned against siding with the Nazis in 1939'

"A fourth American aid worker infected with Ebola walked into Emory University Hospital today after arriving on a medical plane. The patient, a doctor who contracted the virus in Sierra Leone, arrived at 10.20am by ambulance, with a police escort, at the Atlanta hospital to be housed in a special isolation unit. Wearing a bulky protective suit similar to those of Emory's first two arrivals, the patient walked from the ambulance to the hospital - though a different entrance was used this time around. Reporters and television cameras - but fewer curious onlookers - lined the street. Scroll down for video . The patient, a doctor who contracted the virus in Sierra Leone, arrived at 10.20am by ambulance and walked into Emory hospital with the help of a medical worker . The patient is believed to be the third American doctor to contract Ebola and had been working in a clinic in Sierra Leone . An ambulance transporting an American infected with the deadly Ebola virus from West Africa, leaves Dobbins Air Reserve Base on Tuesday . The ambulance driver was pictured on Tuesday morning wearing a protective suit and face-mask while driving to Emory . The patient's identity was not released, and the hospital released no additional details. A medical plane landed in metro Atlanta on Tuesday morning, with the patient headed to Emory University Hospital, where two others - Dr Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol - had been successfully treated. The plane touched down around 9.20am at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, just northwest of Atlanta. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. James Wilson confirmed the arrival. The World Health Organization said a doctor who has been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone has tested positive for the disease.

WHO said the doctor was in stable condition on Monday in Freetown and was being evacuated. Last month, two U.S. aid workers who contracted Ebola in Liberia, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, were treated successfully at Emory. Another worker, Dr. Rick Sacra, 51, is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. In Omaha, Sacra's family members said he was able to eat breakfast Monday for the first time since arriving Friday at the Nebraska hospital. The doctor from Worcester, Massachusetts, remains in stable condition. His wife, Debbie, said that Sacra is more alert and that they had a half-hour conversation by video conference Sunday. 'He hasn't been able to eat much since he got here, but he had some toast and applesauce,' Debbie Sacra said. Dr Rick Sacra, 51, is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha after being the third American to be diagnosed with Ebola . Dr Kent Brantly (pictured left) and aid worker Nancy Writebol both recovered from Ebola after being treated at Emory hospital last month . 'He also tolerated the research drug well - better than he had the previous doses he was given.' Sacra is being treated with an experimental drug that is different than Zmapp, the one given to Brantly and Writebol. Sacra's doctors have refused to name the drug they are using, but they say they've been consulting with experts on Ebola on his treatment. Zmapp also is experimental, and doctors and experts have said it's impossible to know whether the drug helped their recovery. Sacra went to Omaha instead of Atlanta because federal officials asked the medical center to treat him in order to prepare other isolation units to take more Ebola patients if needed. The Ebola outbreak sweeping West Africa has killed more than 2,000 people and has taken a particularly high toll on health care workers.","The plane touched down around 9.20am at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, just northwest of Atlanta .

"When Kyle and Josh Brooks wowed the X Factor judges on Saturday night they were quick to thank the secret to their level-headed success, their grandmother. The twins from South Wales impressed the judging panel with their rendition of Westlife's Us Against the World and gained themselves four 'yes' votes from the judges. However, the 15 year olds say that they will not let their potential fame go to their head thanks to their moral upbringing from their Nan. Scroll down for video . Josh (left) and Kyle Books (right)  with their Nan Colette who they say is to thank for their success . Colette Brooks, 59, became the boys legal guardian when they were just 18-months-old and the twins say that it was her moral upbringing that has guided them to success. Kyle and Josh who are studying for their GCSEs at Stanwell Comprehensive School in Penarth, described their Nan as their inspiration. Teenager Josh says that along with the judges their grandmother is who they want to impress the most. 'We want to make Nan proud because she's given up her life for us. We look up to her as our role model. Colette has been the legal guardian of the twins since they were just 18-months-old . 'She's our world. We want to give something back to make her happy.' The boys are well aware of the sacrifices their Nan has made for them giving up her career and moving into a bigger house in Cardiff to devote her time to their upbringing. Colette admits that at first it wasn't easy but they got through the hard times thanks to the local community. 'It was difficult at the beginning. But we made a lot of friends in Grangetown, which is where we were living at the time. The boys have always shown a keen interest in Christianity and encouraged their Nan to join them in church . 'We joined the local mother and toddler group and they accepted us even though I was old enough to be some of the mothers' mother.' Both boys have religious beliefs and Colette says it was they who encouraged her to go to church after being invited to a barbecue at Cornwall Street Baptist Church, in Grangetown. Although she had become disillusioned with religion Colette said she was impressed by the resident pastor in the church and his wife. 'We were all baptised in the church. I have not pushed them into going to church - they have chosen that path themselves. But their faith has been a very good grounding for them.' The boys impressed the X Factor judges with their rendition of Westlife's Us Against the World . The grandmother says that it was this interest in religion that first sparked the boys singing career. 'Before long Pam suggested that the boys sing a duet in church. I agreed and found that they had really good voices and their singing was appreciated by the congregation. 'I have encouraged them in what they have wanted to do. JA has also been good for them since they haven't really had a male role model. Colette says she is thrilled to be such an inspiration to the twins. 'It lovely to think that I am their role model. For them to be given this chance is absolutely unbelievable. They have had no professional training having just sung in church and in their bedrooms.' Colette added that she is confident that the boys recent brush with fame will not change their moral and religious beliefs. 'They have a marvelous opportunity to show how much talent they have got. I have no worries about how any of this will affect them.'","Josh and Kyle Brooks have thanked their Nan for her support .

"Three Ivy League schools have held their top spots in this year's survey of the best U.S. colleges, it was announced today. According to research on  1,800 schools in the 30th edition of Best Colleges, Princeton University cam first for the second-year running, Harvard held on to second place and Yale again came in a close third. All the schools in the top ten maintained their high-ranking place - apart from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire which dropped from tenth place to 11th spot. Top pick: Princeton University in New Jersey was voted the best college in the U.S. for the second year running, according to the 30th edition of Best Colleges . NATIONAL UNIVERSITIES . Best in class: In a ranking of the best universities, Princeton, Harvard and Yale took the top spots . Princeton in New Jersey, where tuition and fees cost $41,820 a year for 2014-15, came out on top, in part thanks to being 'the first university to offer a ""no loan"" policy to financially needy students, giving grants instead of loans to accepted students who need help paying tuition'. Harvard, which has almost 7,000 students enrolled at its Cambridge campus, costs $43,938 to attend but its achievement of having the largest endowment of any school in the world was noted. Yale's 12 residential colleges that encourage a supportive learning and socializing were also noted by the research. Among liberal arts colleges, Massachusetts' Williams College once again came out on top with Amherst College in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania's Swarthmore College, in second and third places respectively. There are almost 50 lists included in the in-depth college study. For the first time, each campus's safety statistics were also included along with three-year federal loan default rates, from the Department of Education. Separate tables also ranked the regional universities - schools which offered mainly bachelor programs - and regional colleges, schools that grant less than half their degrees in the liberal arts. LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES . Among the liberal arts schools, Massachusetts' Williams College came out on top - but it has one of the priciest tuitions at more than $48,310 a year . The schools are judged on 16 categories including academic excellence, graduation rates and how many freshmen carry on into sophomore year. The Best Colleges guide also has schools that are easier to get into for students without a gleaming A-grade report card - most notably Penn State and California's Soka University of America, according to Yahoo. A breakdown of the best value schools was also offered, weighing both the quality of the teaching and programs alongside getting the most out of your money. Harvard and Amherst came out in top in their categories in this respect while public colleges, the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and the University of California-Santa Cruz were also winners. Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts came in second place on the list of the best colleges in the U.S. following detailed research for prospective students .","1,800 schools judged on an wide range of categories including graduation rates, academic excellence and - for first time - safety on campus .

"Perhaps buoyed by the news of the upcoming royal birth, Princess Eugenie looked in excellent spirits as she watched the tennis. A known tennis enthusiast, Princess Eugenie of York attended the 2014 US Open Men's Final at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center  in New York City yesterday to watch the hotly anticipated game between Marin Cilic and Kei Nishikori. The 24-year-old royal was spotted quaffing champagne with New York entrepreneur Phil Winser and they talked and giggled throughout the match before heading into the exclusive Moet & Chandon Suite. Scroll down for video . Princess Eugenie was joined by Phil Winser at the men's final of the US Open championship . The young royal looks to have made a firm friend in entrepreneur Phil Winser . Eugenie wore a chiffon panel dress with a bold black and white design on the lower two thirds, and looked happy as she chatted animatedly with 29-year-old Phil throughout the game . The Princess's obviously familiarity with Phil will undoubtedly raise a few eyebrows, with her long term boyfriend thousands of miles away in London. While older sister Beatrice has been loved up with long term boyfriend David Clark for years, Eugenie’s love life has remained much more clandestine. Although she has been linked to Jack Brooksbank for the past four years, the pair have always been intensely private about the status of their romance and it is not known how the pair are handling their trans-Atlantic relationship. The pair were last seen together when Eugenie made a brief visit back to the UK and the couple attended Tracey Emin's birthday party in London on July 3. Eugenie has been living in New York since the summer of 2013, working at Paddle8,an online auction house. After the match continued the frivolities, posing for pictures with Hollywood actors Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Peter Sarsgaard, and no doubt enjoying more of the host company’s luxury tipple with her friend. Phil Winser founded the Silkstone Group, a leading New York creative events agency with business partner Ben Towill, before the pair opened three high end restaurants in the city . The 29-year-old even appeared in Forbes ’30 under 30’ 2014 list, and his success certainly seems to have bought the dashing New Yorker a ticket to the highest echelons of society. The Queen’s granddaughter wore a chiffon panel dress with a bold black and white design on the lower two thirds to the match yesterday. Cinched in with a belt, Eugenie threw on a chic tailored blazer for the party in the Moet suite, keeping her hair and make-up simple. Phil, who a leading New York creative events agency, enjoyed the free champagne in the exclusive Moet & Chandon Suite with the princess .

"This incredible map shows how Americans have quit smoking over the past 40 years because of higher taxes on tobacco  and an increased awareness about the dangers of lighting up. The map, created by Metric Maps used data from an annual report on the tax burden of tobacco prepared by the Federation of Tax Administrators, to show the decline on a state-by-state basis. It shows how  Americans consumed an average of 125 packs of cigarettes a year between the late 1950s and the late 1980s. But today that figure has fallen to just 46 packs of cigarettes per capita every year. The sharp decline in the numbers of  smokers appears to reflect a change in our attitudes to the habit, according to a researcher. 'It's a shift in social norms,' Brian King, report author  for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said. 'People no longer see smoking around non-smokers as socially acceptable behaviour.' In 1970, residents in all but two states smoked more than 90 packs of cigarettes a year, according to The Washington Post. By 2012, residents of just three states — Kentucky, West Virginia and New Hampshire — smoked that much. Out of fashion: A researcher suggested that there has been a shift in 'social norms' over smoking . The decline in smoking is, in part, due to the taxes that all 50 states and the District of Columbia levy on packs of cigarettes and other tobacco products. But this wasn't always the case. In 1921, Iowa instituted the first tobacco tax. That year, the state collected $324,000 in taxes. North Carolina was the last state to hold off from implementing a tax and levied its first tax on cigarettes of just 2 cents a pack, in 1969. Today, taxes continue to rise steadily. Revenue: The revenue generated from cigarette sales was $126 million for New York City alone, more than a quarter of the total city and county tax generated across the country . In the Big Apple the levies are $4.35 tax on cigarettes. In four other states — Connecticut, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Washington —it is $3 extra per pack. North Carolina has bolstered its taxes, to 45 cents a pack – despite being a tobacco producing state. And whilst cigarette smoking has declined, taxes have increased at such a dramatic rate that tax income continues to rise. The revenue generated from cigarette sales was $126 million for New York City alone, more than a quarter of the total city and county tax generated across the country. Taxes make up more than half the price of an average pack of cigarettes in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Washington and the District, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators' report. On average, taxes make up just over 44 percent of the price of a pack nationwide. In 2012, states collected more than $18.2 billion in tobacco tax revenue. Utah has always been one of the cleaner-living states where residents strayed away from smoking. Even near peak cigarette use in the 1970s, Utah residents were smoking 66 packs per capita, the lowest rate in the country. Today they consume just 23 packs per capita, lower than any state other than Washington and New York. However, health experts still want more to be done to prevent deaths from second hand smoke which kills an estimated 41,000 non-smokers annually in homes where smokers live. Find out more about Metric Maps here: https://twitter.com/MetricMaps/media .","Smokers consumed an average of 125 packs of cigarettes a year in the U.S. between the 1950s and 1980s .

It’s a mixture of the first person shooter and role playing game genres. Players choose to be either a hunter, warlock or titan to battle aliens. The story is set 700 years in the future when a massive planet-like alien called The Traveller arrives on Earth to help humans spread across the galaxy with superior technology. But Earth’s protective alien is tracked down and almost destroyed, only protecting The Tower skyscraper – the setting for most of Destiny - leaving unfriendly aliens to raid the rest of the solar system, The Guardian reported. In the game, players work together to slay aliens and complete missions to unlock new weapons and abilities to protect what is left of Earth. Victories throughout the game help players ‘level up’ to open up new abilities. All players start with a basic spaceship and mission map, showing activities available throughout the solar system, including quick ‘strike’ missions and longer explorations on Earth, the moon, Venus and Mars. Players can communicate with friends or strangers who they invite into their team via gaming headsets. Some missions require players to create teams to work together. Players don’t shoot each other, but work together to eliminate the enemy aliens. Despite this, the game has an age rating of 16+ as there is a lot of violence used against the aliens. There is no traditional end point of the game, with lots of missions to complete – and more in the pipeline.

"American basketball player DeMarcus Cousins shot back at a reporter who asked him if he knew where to find Slovenia on Monday. 'Do you know where Slovenia is?' the European journalist asked Cousins. 'No,' the basketball center responded. 'Do you know where Alabama is?' Cousins hails from the Southern state - and it's not clear how the journalist responded to his question. As a member of the U.S. basketball team, Cousins is set to play against Slovenia in the quarterfinals on Tuesday for the Basketball World Cup. Multiple fans have praised Cousins for his cheeky reply on Twitter. Scroll down for video . Gotcha! DeMarcus Cousins, seen in an August 1 file photo, was asked if he knew where Slovenia is. Cousins, in turn, asked the reporter if he knew where his home state of Alabama is located . 'Geography bee': Cousins, along with the U.S. basketball team, is set to play against Slovenia in the quarterfinals Tuesday . 'swagged on em haha,' one wrote. Another user said '@boogiecousins you became my favorite bball player with your answer to the Slovenian journalist, good luck in the next game #usa.' 'Greatest response in interview history #where is Alabama,' someone else tweeted. Others wrote 'well done' and called the response 'classic.' At least one media outlet expressed similar sentiments, with Yahoo! Sports saying 'Cousins deserves credit for exposing the rank condescension at the root of this question.' 'The only reason to ask it is to expose the ignorance of the recipient, to indulge in a tired stereotype of the uneducated (and almost always black) American basketball player with no knowledge of the world outside of his immediate experience,' the sports website said. Cousins played basketball for both Birmingham and Mobile high schools, Al.com reported. Though  Slovenia's location on a map may be a mystery to the U.S. basketball team, on the basketball court, the Americans know exactly where to look: on the perimeter. Goran Dragic and the Slovenians are a small team that thrives on the outside but struggles to defend the interior. The Americans will look to ride their size advantage to a victory on Tuesday. The teams met in an exhibition game just before the tournament, and the Americans cruised to a 101-71 victory. Anthony Davis scored 18 points and Kenneth Faried added 14 as the U.S. big men dominated their undersized foes. 'They do not defend in their normal practice a lot of the stuff that we do, so they're not accustomed to being inside,' U.S. coach Mike Krzyzewski said on Monday. 'So our guys have to take advantage of that. Not so much posting, but for offensive rebounds.' Geography: Though DeMarcus Cousins indicated he doesn't know where Slovenia is, it's not clear if the European journalist knows where Cousins' home state of Alabama is . Did it look like this? This photo of Cousins speaking to the media has surfaced on Twitter, reportedly showing his reaction to the reporter's geography question . Krzyzewski was quick to note that the Slovenians were managing Dragic's minutes in the exhibition and that they have since improved. 'But for us, too, we've gotten better since then,' Krzyzewski said. And Slovenia hasn't gotten bigger. Only five players on its roster are 6-foot-7 or taller, while the U.S. roster lists eight players who are at least that big. The Americans had a whopping 50-22 advantage in points in the paint in the first game, though the 6-foot-11 Cousins wouldn't say that bigger always means better. 'Slovenia's a tough team. It doesn't really matter the size I would say,' he said. 'Everybody has a different type of playing style and I think our playing style kind of wore them down. So hopefully we could do that the next game as well.' Cousins wasn't much of a factor then, but has emerged as a powerful weapon off the bench for the Americans. He has scored in double figures in each of the last three games, and shot 5 for 5 in two of them, including Saturday's 86-63 victory over Mexico. Slovenia advanced with a 71-61 victory over the Dominican Republic behind 12 points from Dragic, the Phoenix Suns' star point guard, and 18 from his brother, Zoran. Slam dunk: Cousins hangs over the net while playing Mexico during the 2014 Basketball World Cup on Saturday . The Slovenians went into the final day of the group stage in position to avoid the Americans until the semifinals, but their loss to Lithuania, following Australia's loss to Angola, dropped Slovenia into the other half of the U.S. bracket. The basketball governing body FIBA is investigating Australia's loss because it appeared the players may have stopped trying to defend late. The loss moved the Australians out of a potential quarterfinal matchup with the U.S., however they lost the first elimination game to Turkey. 'It's too bad that we have now USA, but of course we cannot do nothing. We just go to face them and try to win,' Zoran Dragic said. With the Dragic brothers leading the way, Krzyzewski said the Slovenians can put five 3-point shooters on the floor at one time. But if they're not hitting, the U.S. can swarm Goran Dragic, as it did in holding him to 3-for-11 shooting in the exhibition rout. Dragic was in foul trouble that night, as were plenty of teammates who struggled to defend bigger players. The U.S. shot 46 free throws, while Slovenia was just 10 of 17.

"A woman flew into a jealous rage and chopped off her partner’s penis before flushing it down the toilet after discovering that he was cheating. Huaman Julia Muñoz, 41, allegedly decided to inflict a grisly act of revenge on her partner, Ramon Arias Apayco’s, 46, while he slept. Munoz allegedly sliced off her boyfriend's penis with a kitchen knife as he slept at a hostel in Brena, Peru, The New Age website reported. The woman allegedly sliced off her partner's manhood for his cheating ways . The scorned woman attempted to flee after her violent act but was caught by horrified hostel staff who alerted the police. When police quizzed her about the attack, she confessed that she had discovered that her partner had been unfaithful and she reacted in fury. Ramon Arias Apayco was taken to hospital and placed in intensive care according to New Age. This is not the first example of women taking extreme revenge. Down the toilet: The spurned woman allegedly threw her partner's penis into the toilet . A woman in southern Bangladesh cut off a man's penis during an alleged attempt to rape her and took it to a police station as evidence, the BBC reported. The incident took place in Mirzapur village, Jhalakathi, about 200km (124 miles) south of the capital, Dhaka in May 2011. Married Monju Begum, 40, a mother-of-three, told police that her neighbour Mozammel Haq Mazi forced his way into her home and started assaulting her. Mr Mazi, who denies the accusation, was admitted to a nearby hospital. In July 2011, Catherine Kieu Becker, of California, was arrested after she drugged her estranged husband.

"Women who shave their bikini lines risk complications such as infections, burns, severe itching, rashes or cuts, a new study has warned. U.S. researchers found that 87 per cent of women currently remove all or some of their pubic hair, with the majority using a razor, while the rest admitted to getting a bikini wax at least once in their life. Almost two thirds (60 per cent) of the women also reported experiencing at least one health-related complication, which also included invisible cuts to the skin called epidermal abrasions, ingrown hairs, bruises or allergies. Scroll down for video . U.S. researchers found that almost two thirds of women surveyed experienced at least one health complication as a result of removing their public hair, such as infections, burns, severe itching, rashes or cuts . Overweight and obese women were found to be twice as likely to experience a complication than their slimmer counterparts and three times more likely if they removed all of their pubic hair rather than just some of it. For the new research, women who received care from April to June 2012 at two publicly funded clinics in the Texas Gulf Coast region were asked questions about their pubic hair removal via a questionnaire. In total, the data of 333 women was used, and they were all aged 16- 40 years old and of differing ethnicities. Researchers found only 4 per cent of all the women had ever seen a health care provider for a complication related to their pubic hair removal, and only 4 per cent had discussed how to safely remove their hair with a professional. Previous studies have found that waxing a bikini line increases the risk of contracting an STD . Black and Hispanic women were less likely than white women to report complications, the study found. Despite the complications, only 44 of the women surveyed said they used to remove their hair but had stopped. The most common reason cited by 41 per cent of these women was disliking the side effects, which included stubble, bumps, rashes, or ingrown hairs. Other reasons were too much of a hassle (25 per cent), lack of sexual activity (11.4 per cent), liking the look of pubic hair (7.1 per cent), and their partner wanted them to stop (2.4 per cent). Becoming pregnant was the reason 14 women said they had stopped. In the report, lead researcher Andrea DeMaria, lead researcher from the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Women's Health at the University of Texas Medical Branch concluded women should seek professional advice about safe hair removal. She said: ‘Minor complications commonly occur as a result of pubic hair removal. 'Gynecological visits could provide a safe environment for women to discuss pubic hair removal practices.’ The study was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Previous research has found that bikini waxing could increase the risk of contracting an STI because removing the public hair can cause 'deficits in the mucocutaneous barrier' - the membrane of the skin - allowing viruses or bacteria to enter the body. The study found self-waxing kits also led to burns that required split skin grafting. However, a past Australian study found waxing has helped to eradicate pubic lice. Doctors said that as pubic hair disappeared, so did the crab-shaped insects that had made homes in human groins since man first appeared. Andrea DeMaria, from the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Women's Health, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology at the University of Texas Medical Branch gave the following advice on safe bikini-line shaving. She told Yahoo news: .","U.S. researchers found 87% of women remove some or all pubic hair .

"The widow of a man who died from cancer of the penis has urged others not to be embarrassed about getting suspicious symptoms checked out. Chris Barber was just 52 when he succumbed to the disease - having been too shy to admit his symptoms before it was too late. Now his wife Anita Barber is determined that no more men die of shame. Scroll down for video . Chris Barber was just 52 when he succumbed to cancer of the penis - having been too embarrassed to admit his symptoms in the early stages.  His wife Anita, 51, is now determined to ensure no more men 'die of shame' The Barber family at the wedding of eldest daughter, Kerry, when Mr Barber was undergoing treatment . She said: 'My brave husband could not find the words to talk about his illness, but I am hoping that in doing so, more lives will be saved.' Mrs Barber, 51, from Fakenham, Norfolk, said: 'I am haunted by the fact that more could have been done - had Chris not been too embarrassed to talk about his symptoms earlier. ‘Men should not die because of embarrassment and shame. We talk about breast cancer and testicular cancer, so why not this? She added: ‘Women are usually happy to talk about their bodies, but men are much more reserved and I honestly feel that attitude is costing lives and because of what happened to Chris I want to help change that.’ ‘We’d been married for 32 years. We were looking forward to retiring together, we should have been growing old together. ‘I couldn’t stop thinking about the early days and if it could have been different if he’d sought help and been diagnosed quicker?' Since his death two years ago, Mrs Barber and the couple’s three daughters, Kerry Kid, 33, Sharon Jermy, 29, and Katie Finn, 26, have supported the Norfolk-based Blue Ribbon Foundation to raise awareness of male cancers. Mr Barber, a carpenter, before he became ill. His wife said: 'My brave husband could not find the words to talk about his illness, but I am hoping that in doing so, more lives will be saved.  I fear he could have been saved' Mrs Barber, who works as a GPs receptionist, said her husband (here on daughter Kerry's wedding day) put off seeing his doctor for weeks after experiencing pain in his genitals. It was six months before he sought help . The aim is to encourage men to seek medical advice without shame and embarrassment. Mrs Barber, who works as a GPs receptionist, said her husband put off seeing his doctor for weeks after experiencing pain in his genitals. She said: ‘I noticed him wincing when he pulled his underwear and trousers on. A painless lump or ulcer on the penis that doesn't heal . Bleeding . A red rash under the foreskin . Flat growths of brownish colour . Difficulty in drawing back the foreskin . Unusual smelling discharge from under the foreskin . Unexplained change in colour of the skin . Swollen lymph nodes in the groin area . ‘When I pushed him he admitted things were uncomfortable below  - he was experiencing irritation and discomfort dressing - but he brushed it off as nothing and carried on as normal. 'Later it become difficult to move his foreskin and the first procedure he underwent was a circumcision. 'I urged him to see our GP, but like most men, Chris put it off. ‘He said he was too busy at work to take time off but I began to suspect he was also embarrassed too.’ Mrs Barber says her husband, then aged 41, was a very private man. ‘He was a carpenter and worked in a male dominated environment. 'He was a very strong and solid man and just wouldn’t have felt comfortable talking about intimate parts of his body.’ It wasn’t until six months later, in January 2001, that she tired of her husband’s procrastinating, rang their GP herself. She says: ‘I offered to go with him but he looked horrified so we agreed he would go alone. He came back after saying he’d need a minor operation and we both felt relieved that it was being dealt with.’ Mr Barber was 'a very strong and solid man and just wouldn’t have felt comfortable talking about intimate parts of his body', his widow said . Following surgery the couple assumed that was the end of the matter, but after a follow up appointment Mr Barber returned to the couple’s home ashen faced. His wife said: ‘He told me that they had performed a biopsy of cells taken from the circumcision and these had been found to be cancerous. July 2000: His symptoms began . January 2001: Finally went to GP at  wife's insistence. Underwent circumcision and biopsy few weeks later, which revealed cancerous cells. 2003: Developed ulcers on his penis and returned to the GP . 2004: Had more skin removed and began six-monthly check-ups . November 2008: Had portion of his penis removed and reconstructive surgery . February 2010: MRI scan showed cancer  had spread to his pelvis . August 2009: Starts chemotherapy . October 2011: Passes away due to the disease . ‘I was shocked, I’d never even heard of cancer of the penis.’ But medics assured the couple they were confident all the cells had been removed. However a few months later, Mr Barber developed ulcers on his penis. This time he went straight to the GP, who diagnosed cancer of the penis. More surgery at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital followed but the diseased tissue kept reappearing over the following years. Mrs Barber said: ‘It nagged in my mind that treatment had been delayed because he was too embarrassed to see the doctor. I wished I had pushed him into going sooner.’ By November 2008, consultants decided drastic action to try and keep the cancer at bay was the only option - and decided to amputate a portion of the organ. Mrs Barber recalls: ‘I gripped his hand but he didn’t flinch at all. I knew to him it was the ultimate indignity but he was determined to keep strong and brave for me. ‘I told him I didn’t care about anything as long as he was well.’ Despite the severity of his condition, Mr Barber continued to insist to his daughters he was fine. ‘That was typical of him, he would not have wanted his girls to worry about him,' said his wife. 'As far as he was concerned it was his job to worry about them, not the other way around.’ Despite battling chemo that left him exhausted and sick, Mr Barber wrote a speech and walked daughter Sharon down the aisle on her wedding day . Mr Barber was such a private man that he told colleagues the reason for his hospital appointments was a bad leg - rather than his rare cancer . When he needed to take time off for hospital appointments, he told colleagues he had a bad leg - because he was too embarrassed to admit the truth.' The seven- hour operation to remove a portion of his penis and lymph nodes in the groin was a success and he underwent reconstructive surgery at the same time. Mrs Barber said: ‘He really didn’t look any different too me and when he was strong enough, intimacy was normal - but that really had been the least of my worries.’ But in early 2010 Mr Barber reported pain in his hips and thighs and was sent for a CT scan - with devastating results. It revealed a tumour on his pelvis and a consultant confirmed the cancer had spread and was now incurable. Mrs Barber said: ‘I broke down in tears when he said the only option was treatment to try and extend his life. 'But Chris just asked when could he start - I had never seen such bravery and courage.’ Mr Barber succumbed to the disease in October 2011, after battling an infection in hospital . The family are now supporting the Norfolk-based Blue Ribbon Foundation to raise awareness of male cancers. When daughter Katie married in June last year, the logo featured strongly in honour of her father . His family rallied as he began chemotherapy and, fearing the worst, his daughter Sharon brought  forward her wedding day. 'She wanted her father to give her away and we didn’t know how much time he had left. Despite battling chemo that left him exhausted and sick, he wrote a speech and walked her down the aisle. He later told me he wouldn't have missed it for the world.' Over the following months, the father-of-three's health faded and in October 2011 he was admitted to hospital battling an infection. When treatment failed, his family was warned they were losing him. Mrs Barber and her daughters kept vigil, sleeping in their cars at the hospital to be nearer to him. It was daughter Sharon who was sleeping in a chair by his bedside when she woke to see her father had stopped breathing in his sleep. Her mother said: ‘She phoned us and we raced upstairs to her. It was typical of Chris to go quietly in his sleep with no fuss. It was the way he would have wanted. ‘I kissed him and told him how much I loved him.’ Mrs Barber said: ‘It was Katie’s way of having her father involved in her day and I know he would have been bursting with pride' But as she planned his funeral Mrs Barber felt cheated - and wished her husband had sought treatment sooner.' So when fellow cancer patient Mel Lacey - whom Chris had grown close to in hospital - launched a charity to raise awareness of male cancers, Mrs Barber and her daughters offered their support. The aim of the Blue Ribbon Foundation is to encourage men to seek medical advice without shame and embarrassment. When daughter Katie married in June last year, the Blue Ribbon logo featured strongly in honour of her father. Mrs Barber said: ‘It was Katie’s way of having her father involved in her day and I know he would have been bursting with pride. ‘Chris was the best husband and father we could ever have wished for. But he just couldn’t talk about his illness. That’s why we are doing it for him, because no more men like Chris should die of shame.

"Posing with her hand on her swollen stomach, Lyn Perrett joked about being nine months pregnant. But the 53-year-old's smile masked her concern. She had been through the menopause, and was suffering pains in her stomach. Concerned, Mrs Perrett, from Solihull in the West Midlands, visited her doctor, and was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). But when medication, cutting out wheat and dairy from her diet, and colonic irrigation failed to ease her symptoms, she returned to see another doctor. Lyn Perrett, 53, became concerned last year when her stomach began to bloat and she suffered pains. After visiting her doctor she was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). But after months of trying various treatments her stomach started to get bigger and bigger . Mrs Perrett was referred to see a specialist, who performed an ultrasound. It revealed a giant cyst in her womb. While performing a full hysterectomy, surgeons removed a growth the size of a rugby ball. It was at a follow-up appointment that specialists told Mrs Perrett the mass had been cancerous, diagnosing her with a rare but life-threatening Fallopian tube cancer. Mrs Perrett, told MailOnline: 'I'd gone through the menopause a few years before and thought I was done with all the bloating and discomfort. Then I started getting pains in my tummy.' Visiting her doctor in January 2013, company director Mrs Perrett was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, a common digestive complaint. Looking up solutions online, she did all she could to help curb the distressing symptoms; cutting out wheat and dairy and taking medication to settle her belly. She even tried colonic irrigation, which seemed to soothe her symptoms. However, after about a month of respite, they returned with vengeance. 'My stomach was just getting bigger and bigger,' the mother-of-one said. 'I tried to laugh it off. 'I even posed for a picture with my hand on my belly as if I was pregnant. 'Though I was worried and returned for another colonic as that had helped before.' During the session, the nurse suggested Mrs Perrett's swollen stomach could be down to a cyst. It prompted her to get a crucial second opinion. The second doctor was much more concerned at the sight of  her terribly swollen belly, immediately referring her to a specialist at the Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham. An ultrasound revealed an ovarian cyst and Mrs Perrett was advised to have a full hysterectomy. While waiting for surgery, her tummy continued to balloon. 'By then, I looked nine months pregnant,' she said. 'I felt like I was pregnant, I walked like I was pregnant. I couldn't touch my toes and had to sit down to put my shoes on. The pain was excruciating too. Painkillers didn't touch the sides. 'One morning, I woke up and the agony was worse than giving birth. It took me 10 minutes to get down one stair.' Following her operation, doctors told the 53-year-old the cyst had been the size of a rugby ball. 'There was no indication at all that the cyst was anything to worry about and, though a hysterectomy is a big operation, it wasn't like I could've had anymore kids anyway,' she told MailOnline. 'I was left with an 11-inch scar and 40 metal staples holding it together. Mrs Perrett, pictured before treatment left, and afterwards, right, sought a second opinion and was referred to a specialist. An ultrasound revealed a huge mass in her womb. Surgeons removed the cyst but tests revealed the lump was cancerous, diagnosing the 53-year-old with a rare fallopian tube cancer . Fallopian tube cancer is a rare form of the disease. The fallopian tubes link the ovaries to the womb, carrying eggs from the to the womb. Only around one in 100 cancers of the female reproductive system are fallopian tube cancer. However many experts believe most high grade serious type ovarian cancers actually start in the far end of the fallopian tube, rather than on the surface of the ovary. It is most common in post-menopausal women. Symptoms include: . Scientists do not know what causes fallopian tube cancer, but if two or more of your very close relatives - your mother, sister or daughter - have had ovarian cancer, your risk may be increased. Two genes have been linked to causing ovarian and fallopian tube cancer. They are the BRCA genes. Researchers believe the faulty BRCA gene may cause around 16 in 100 cancers or the fallopian tube. The disease can be hard to diagnose, but doctors will routinely perform pelvic examinations, scans and blood tests. As with ovarian cancer, surgeons will try to remove as much of the tumour as possible. Chemotherapy is often used after surgery to try and stop the cancer from returning. Source: Cancer Research UK . 'But I just went home and tried to get on with my life, glad to be back in my normal clothes again without that swelling.' But weeks on, during a check-up, doctors revealed that they had tested tissue taken from Mrs Perrett and discovered she had an incredibly rare Fallopian tube cancer. She was then put through six sessions of chemotherapy last June to make sure the cancer did not return. 'I just got on with it and insisted on working all the way through my treatment,' she said. 'The worst bit for me was losing my long blonde hair. I'd read about the symptoms I could expect but nothing prepares you for seeing your hair coming out in clumps. 'It's one of the most devastating things a woman can go through. I lost my lashes and brows, too. I found myself a wig but thought there was nothing I could do about my facial hair.' To her relief, Mrs Perrett discovered that she could have her eyebrows tattooed on, as well as semi-permanent eyeliner. 'It helped to shape my face and made me feel so much more confident,' she said. 'I wish more women knew about it. Just make sure you have it done before you start chemo in case of infection.' Mrs Perrett is now in remission and attends the hospital for regular check-ups. 'People need to know that IBS symptoms can be the same as cancer and to make sure they don't get fobbed off by doctors,' she told MailOnline. 'I used to giggle about my baby bump but my little joke could have killed me. Looking back now, it's awful to think there was such a huge ticking time bomb inside me. 'If the cyst hadn't grown, I would've continued to think I had IBS and I wouldn't be here today.'","Lyn Perrett started to experience pain when her stomach bloated last year .

"A father has condemned the NHS for double standards after he was refused a surgery on his chest due to his gender, he believes. Gareth Edwards pleaded with the NHS for surgery after one side of his chest became bigger than the other, resembling a breast. The 24-year-old suffers from gynecomastia - swelling of the breast tissue in men, caused by an imbalance of the hormones oestrogen and testosterone. Scroll down for video . Gareth Edwards, 24, suffers from gynecomastia - swelling of breast tissue in men. The condition has led to his chest becoming asymmetrical . The father-of-one says the stress of his condition is making him ill - and he desperately wants surgery . The condition can can affect one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly. While it isn't a threat to health, it can cause great emotional distress to those affected. Mr Edwards, a father-of-one, says he is so distressed by his appearance he can no longer go to the gym or show his chest on the beach. He is now desperate to have surgery to make his breasts more symmetrical. However the NHS has refused to fund the op because there is no demonstrable health benefit to having it. Mr Edwards, from Bovey Tracey, Devon, said has now been told it will cost more than £3,000 to have an operation privately - money he does not have. Mr Edwards believes he has a right to have surgery on the NHS - but has been refused the op . The hotel chef, who weighs 9st, said: 'About six months ago I noticed one side of my chest was bigger than the other. 'It's now got to the point where I can't go to the gym, or the beach on a sunny day and take off my T-shirt. I'm scared people are staring at me. 'My friends were shocked I had a boob and said I should seek help. 'I was told it is fatty tissue that needs removing - and it's only going to get bigger.' He insists private surgery is not an option due to his personal circumstances. 'I have a young son and a family to feed and clothe - I don’t have that kind of money. I need the operation to remove the lump and gristle, which is causing the problem.' He added: 'I pay taxes and National Insurance. All I’m asking is for the NHS to do its job and fix my issue, which I shouldn't have to pay for. The stress of it all is making me ill. 'Women get boob jobs on the NHS but I can't get help - it's very upsetting.' A spokesman for South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group said: 'When making these decisions we have a responsibility to take into account ethical issues, safety, clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness, balancing the needs of the majority with the differing needs of the individual. 'We are not unsympathetic to any individual who wishes to change their appearance. 'However when there is no demonstrable health benefit to the individual the NHS is unlikely to agree funding.' The breast is made up of two main components, glandular tissue (firm and dense) and fatty tissue (soft). The ratio of glandular to fatty tissue in any breast varies from individual to individual and in gynaecomastia there may be an excess of both. If there is predominantly a diffuse fatty enlargement of the breast, liposuction is the usual treatment. This involves sucking out the tissue through a small tube inserted via a 3-4mm incision. If excess glandular tissue is the primary cause of breast enlargement, it may need to be excised (cut out) with a scalpel. This will leave a scar, usually around the nipple edge. This excision can be performed alone or in conjunction with liposuction. Major reductions that involve the removal of a significant amount of tissue and skin may require larger incisions that result in more obvious scars. Most operations for gynaecomastia take about 90 minutes and are performed under general anaesthetic, or in some cases, under local anaesthesic with sedation.

"A doctor has made history by having a smear test on live TV in a bid to urge other women not to miss their vital screening appointments. Dr Dawn Harper appeared on ITV's This Morning as part of the programme #NoFearGoSmear campaign. While smear tests save the lives of more than 4,500 women each year, one in three women under 35 refuses to have one, figures show. Scroll down for video . Dr Dawn Harper had a smear test live on ITV's This Morning as presenter Holly Willoughby looked on, to raise awareness of the importance of women having regular tests to help prevent cervical cancer . Lying on a plinth with her legs in stirrups, Dr Harper, who also appears on Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies, became a patient for the day. She said: 'When I was first called for a smear I was already at medical school so I knew how important it is. 'Today is about raising awareness.' While presenter Holly Willoughby asked about the instruments used to perform a smear test, an oncologist performed the examination on Dr Harper. Dr Harper, said: 'If you're between 25 and 49 you should have a smear test every three years. 'After that women should have them every five years until they are 65, unless they have any abnormalities. 'It is preferable to go for a test mid-cycle, because bleeding can obscure the cells and can lead to an inadequate result, which means you might have to go back. 'Everybody's uterus tips either forwards or backwards. If yours tips backwards it can be harder to perform a smear test, so I always advise patients to pop their hands under their bottom to tip the pelvis. 'Usually you can expect your results within two to three weeks.' Viewers were told Dr Harper (pictured) was making 'TV history' by having the smear test live on air . Reporting back on her test, she added: 'It feels a bit cold but that's it, I didn't feel a thing.' The campaign comes as the charity The Eve Appeal urged women to learn more about gynaecological cancers as part of the national awareness month. A survey carried out by the charity found less than a quarter of 16 to 25-year-olds said they felt confident they were well informed about gynaecological health issues, compared to more than 42 per cent of women aged 66 to 75. The charity is campaigning to raise awareness and help young women face up to embarrassment around the issues, in order to prevent cancer. Currently in the UK, 55 women are diagnosed with a gynaecological cancer every day. The study found more than one in 10 of 16 to 35-year-olds said they found it very hard to talk to their GP about gynaecological health. Nearly a third admitted they had avoided going to the doctors altogether about related issues because they were too embarrassed. These figures were found to dramatically decrease among women in older age groups. Helena Morrissey, chairman of The Eve Appeal said she wanted women to talk openly about gynaecological cancers. She said: ‘At the Eve Appeal we know how important it is to promote straight talking about the signs and symptoms of gynaecological cancers to women of all ages, and this survey has highlighted just how far we still have to go to make this happen. ‘These cancers have some of the worst outcomes for women, with a 40 per cent mortality rate. 'Understanding the symptoms will save lives, which is why we are urging women this Gynaecological Cancer Awareness Month to talk more openly about these life-saving issues.’ The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years. It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb). A sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis. Those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment. The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged between 25 and 64 every three to five years. It involves a doctor inserting a speculum, pictured, into the vagina before using a fine brush to collect cells at the neck of the cervix . Currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young. According to Cancer Research UK statistics, not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009-2011. The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) advised the NHS in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good. The committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord, and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children, and could cause significant anxiety. Many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25, including Italy, France, Belgium and Ireland. In Scotland, women are invited to be checked from the age of 20, though it is due to go up to 25 next year. In Australia women are invited from 18, Greece from 20, and in the US two years after women become sexually active. Meanwhile, other countries start cervical screening later. Both the Netherlands and Finland offer screening to women only once they are 30, and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in Europe, and in Bulgaria it is for women over 31.","Dr Dawn Harper appeared on ITV's This Morning to have a smear test .

"Defensive lineman Montori Hughes has taken extended leave from the Indianapolis Colts after the sudden death of his three-month-old daughter. Coach Chuck Pagano revealed at a media conference on Thursday that Maveah Alice Hughes, Hughes' daughter with girlfriend Leigh Burton, died suddenly last week following an illness. He explained that Hughes had brought Maveah to training camp at Anderson University earlier this month and the infant 'was perfectly fine'. Tragic: Montori Hughes, a defensive lineman for the Indianapolis Colts (pictured in May), has taken extended leave following the sudden death of his three-month-old daughter last week, his coach revealed . But she became ill and passed away last week, he explained, Fox59 reported. 'I can't imagine,' he said. 'No parent should have to bury a child. We all go through circumstances. This is an extremely, extremely difficult time for Montori and his family.' Just weeks ago, proud dad Montori was pictured carrying Maveah as he introduced her to Colts owner Jim Irsay and quarterback Andrew Luck during training practice. The team released no further details about the cause of the little girl's death. Heartbreaking: Three-month-old Maveah passed away last week after suffering from a short illness .

"A mother has been warned her 18-month-old daughter could be scarred for life after a scalding radiator caused horrific burns. Lariah Daley was left screaming in agony after she placed her hand on the radiator while she played with her dolls at home. Her horrified mother Elisha Parker rushed her to hospital where doctors bandaged her right hand, which had swelled up to twice its normal size. Lariah Faley suffered horrific burns after placing her hand on a radiator that was 'volcanic' in temperature, her mother Elisha Parker claims . Miss Parker, 26, said: 'The first I knew that something was wrong was when I heard Lariah crying out. 'I went to see what was going on and she had placed her hand on one of the radiators. 'I could smell burning flesh and could see her fingers were really swollen. They were a mess. 'I put my hand on the radiator to see how hot it was and it was volcanic. It was obviously faulty. The doctors say Lariah could be scarred for life. 'I just thank God it was her hand and not her face.' Lariah was hurt at her home on the morning of August 30 when she was playing in her bedroom at the family’s new housing association flat in Nottingham. Despite the hot weather, Miss Parker claims the radiator was automatically programmed to come on. Miss Parker, who also has a two-year-old son Terae, is now campaigning for all housing associations to place protective guards around radiators in their properties. She said: 'The flat is not child friendly. The radiators get extremely hot and there should be something to stop children getting hurt like this. 'If there had been a protective guard cover over the radiator, this would not have happened to Lariah. 'That is why I am so angry and I want some answers from them. I don’t think it is acceptable. 'I could smell burning flesh and could see Lariah's fingers were really swollen,' says Miss Parker . Doctors have now warned the 18-month-old could be scarred for life after the incident last month . 'Lariah has been left in a lot of pain and she is having to go back to the hospital every couple of weeks for dressings. 'It is also not very nice for my son to see, either. We usually like to go out as a family, going swimming. 'But we are not able to do that at the moment because of Lariah’s hand.' A spokesman for the housing association said: 'We are sorry to hear about Miss Parker’s daughter. 'Customers can control the heating in their accommodation and they are provided with instructions and given guidance on how to use the system when they first move in. 'The safety of our customers is of the utmost importance, and we requested an external contractor to complete an assessment on the radiators and heating system. 'We are reviewing the recommendations in the report as part of our ongoing investigation.'","Lariah Daley placed her hand on the radiator while playing with her dolls .

"A short entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes how in 789AD Viking ships landed on Britain's shores and immediately killed a local official who welcomed them. This was just the beginning of what would become a long history of vicious raids and fierce battles between the Norsemen and the English. Now, archaeologists have uncovered a ring-shaped fortress that historians believe was used to train Vikings ahead of a large invasion of England in 1013. The newly discovered fortress is large at 475ft (145 metres) from side to side and is the same shape as a typical Trelleborg plan, with four 'gates' like the one pictured above . Located in Vallø on the Danish island of Zealand - around 30 miles (48km) south of Copenhagen - the fortress is only the fifth of its kind to be discovered – and the first in 60 years. ‘The Vikings have a reputation as a berserker and pirates. It comes as a surprise to many that they were also capable of building magnificent fortresses,’ said Søren Sindbæk, professor of medieval archaeology at Aarhus University. ‘The discovery of the new Viking fortress is a unique opportunity to gain new knowledge about Viking war and conflicts, and we get a new chance to examine the Vikings' most famous monuments.’ Nanna Holm, curator of The Danish Castle Centre, said that precise new laser measurements of the landscape led her to the hidden circular fortress, which is large at 475ft (145 metres) from side to side. Located in Vallø on the Danish island of Zealand (both marked) - around 30 miles (48km) south of Copenhagen - the fortress is only the fifth of its kind to be discovered – and the first in 60 years . Archaeologists (pictured) have uncovered a ring-shaped fortress that historians believe was used to train Vikings ahead of a large invasion of England in 1013 . ‘We recognise the “Trelleborg” fortresses by the precise circular shape of the ramparts and by the four massive gates that are directed at the four corners of the compass,’ Dr Holm explained. Trelleborgs are ring-shaped Viking fortresses. They were all built in a circular shape with a rampart and four gateways. A total of five are known to exist - located in modern Denmark and the south of Sweden. The majority of trelleborgs have been dated to the reign of the Harold Bluetooth of Denmark who died in 986AD. The newly-discovered Vallø fortress is thought to date back to the late tenth century, and could have been built at the request of the king. But some experts think it was made by his son,Sweyn Forkbeard,who was the first Danish king of England. They say it could have been used as a military training camp or barracks from which to launch his invasions of England. King Forkbeard took control of London in 1013 and was soon afterwards declared to be King of England. ‘Our investigations show that the new fortress was perfectly circular and had sturdy timber along the front; we have so far examined two gates, and they agree exactly with the “Trelleborg” plan. It is a marvellous find.’ Some historians think that the geometric design of the Trellenborgs - which are named after the location of the first one discovered - was inspired by old Roman army camps. Dr Sindbæk said that the find was the result of considerable detective work. ‘We suspected that one fortress was 'missing' in the island Zealand. 'The location at Vallø was quite the right setting in the landscape: in a place where the old main roads met and reached out to Køge river valley, in the Viking Age was a navigable fjord and one of Zealand's best natural harbours. From there we worked our way forward step by step.’ Dr Holm said that the fortress was an active military camp and probably the scene of considerable fighting. ‘We can see that the gates were burned-down. In the north gate we found massive, charred oak posts.’ A short entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes how in 789AD Viking ships landed on Britain's shore and immediately killed a local official who welcomed them –and this was just the beginning with more vicious raids and fierce battles to come, with London taken by Vikings (actors pictured) in 1013AD . Dr Sindbæk said: 'The location at Vallø (pictured) was quite the right setting in the landscape [for the fortress]: in a place where the old main roads met and reached out to Køge river valley, in the Viking Age was a navigable fjord and one of Zealand's best natural harbors. From there we worked our way forward step by step.’ Helen Goodchild, an expert in archaeological geophysics from the University of York, measured small variations in the Earth’s magnetism to find features without damaging the site. Dr Sindbæk explained: ‘In this way we achieved an amazingly detailed “ghost image” of the fortress in a few days. Then we knew exactly where we had to put in excavation trenches to get as much information as possible about the mysterious fortress.’ She is sure the site dates from the Viking Age because of its distinctive design. Samples of the burned wood are being carbon dated to provide more accurate dating. ‘If we can establish exactly when the fortress was built, we may be able to understand the historic events, which the fortress was part of.’ Dr Holm is eager to find out whether the castle will turn out to be from the time of King Harald Bluetooth, like the previously known fortresses, or perhaps a former king's work. ‘As a military fortification from the Viking Age, the monument may help to unravel the position of Zealand in relation to the oldest Danish kingdom,’ she said. So far, only small parts of the fortress have been excavated. Dr Sindbæk said: ‘This is really exciting. A find like this does not happen many times in his life-time. ‘The excavation has confirmed far more than we dared hope, but there is much more to learn. ‘The next big question is whether there were large buildings inside the castle, as in the known Trelleborg fortresses. ‘The find also raises the question as to whether there will be more new Viking fortresses to discover. The exploration will be a wonderful journey of discovery.’","The fortress was discovered on the Danish island of Zealand around 30 miles (48km) south of Copenhagen, but very little has been excavated .

"A new documentary is set to hit our screens in December, which will lift the lid on the sugar daddy dating phenomenon; an industry which is quietly booming in the U.S., but one that is, for many, little understood. Daddies Date Babies follows the trials and tribulations of five New York-based 'sugar babies' in their late teens to twenties who provide sex and companionship to 'sugar daddies' - wealthy, generally older men - in return for financial support. 'The women want as much money as possible for as much stability as possible,' one participant says in the film's trailer. 'The men want to pay as little as possible for as much novelty as possible.' Scroll down to watch trailer . Lucrative: New documentary Daddies Date Babies follows five  'sugar babies' in their late teens to twenties who provide sex and companionship to 'sugar daddies' - wealthy, older men - in return for financial support . The concept behind the short documentary was formed after filmmaker Parinda Wanitwat happened across immersive journalist Melanie Berliet's undercover account on being a 'sugar baby,' penned for Vanity Fair. The site Miss Berliet used to source her Sugar Daddy encounters was Seeking Arrangement; the industry's Match.com equivalent, and the site where Ms Wanitwat was to source her film's subjects. Launched in 2006, Seeking Arrangement matches willing sugar babies - 44per cent of whom are female college students - with wealthy sugar daddies. It's free to join for women, and there are approximately eight women for every one man on the site. 'I got into sugar babying because I didn't have a job, had graduated from college and needed money,' one of the film's subjects, 25-year-old Tess Wood, told The Huffington Post. 'It seemed easier than bar-tending. It seemed like a very available option. It seemed easy to fall into.' Trauma: This woman specifically admits to being raped. 'My life needs to change,' she says . Ms Wood, who says she agreed to take part in the documentary to 'deconstruct the stigma' of sugar daddy dating, has enjoyed both success and disappointment as part of her experience. She has been involved in 'mutually beneficial' relationships in Chicago, New York and Florida, and feels that the 'shame' people feel around sex and sex work needs to shift. Many of the sugar daddies on Seeking Arrangement are 'verified,' which means they have been subject to a full background check and had their high incomes confirmed by their tax returns. Still, a number of men Ms Wood has been involved with, she says, either promised money that never appeared, or lead her to 'fear' for her safety; and she now no longer partakes in sugar daddy dating. Worryingly, the trailer for Daddies Date Babies spotlights several allusions to dark experiences in the anonymous words of its subjects. 'He was really f***ing creepy,' one woman mentions. 'He tried to brainwash me,' claims another. There are also references to '70-year-old white dudes' and men with 'missing teeth.' One sugar daddy is described as having a habit for going to Japan in search of 'small school girls,' while another woman specifically admits to being raped. 'It's time for things to change. My life needs to change,' the unidentified sugar baby says. Anonymous: Several women who appeared in the documentary chose not to be identified . Dark side: 'He was really f***ing creepy,' one woman mentions. 'He tried to brainwash me' For Stephany Xu however, a 23-year-old self-described entrepreneur, Seeking Arrangement has brought her a wealth, literally, of great experiences over the past five years. She describes her sugar daddies as being 'nice, knowledgeable and supportive' and references some who have remained 'close mentors' to her, even after their formal arrangement has been dropped. For Ms Xu, and many other sugar babies, the problem of 'false promises' from sugar daddies can be largely avoided by obtaining the use of his credit card, as an absolute requirement. 'The only way I will accept it working is if I'm given a credit card,' she says. 'My credit line is amazing. I could take out as many mortgages as I want to. I have 14 or 15 cards.' 'The best men get the best girls,' Seeking Arrangement's CEO, Brandon Wade, is quoted as saying in the trailer. 'The men who get the most money, will be the most successful in relationships.' For Miss Berliet, who sparked the documentary with her uncover piece, Sugar Daddy dating is simply a formalization of the sorts of relationships we see all around us. 'People love to deride sugar daddy dating as 'prostitution,' as if by slapping that label on it, it's automatically a terrible thing,' she says. 'The truth is that there's an economic component to most, if not all, relationships. With sugar daddies and babies, the relationship terms are more overt. 'What's interesting is that many who frown upon the idea of embracing the financial component of a relationship, wear diamond engagement rings. 'If you don't see an expensive ring as a contract of sorts, you're fooling yourself.'","Sugar daddies are wealthy men who provide money or gifts in return for sex and companionship .

"Everyday drivers are seeing their cars invaded by total strangers thanks to the Uber car service app. While it's given drivers the power to make money with their cars, Uber is also creating some very uncomfortable situations in cities across America as users unwittingly hop in the back seats of drivers who are simply trying to park. As the service becomes ever more popular, complaints about the unintended 'Uber Effect' are racking up on social media. Uber effect: It's been great for drivers trying to make a buck and people in need of a lift, but the Uber Effect is seeing users across America mistakenly jumping into the cars of unwitting strangers . Some victims of the unsettling situations blame themselves--or at least their choice of car. 'The uber effect: a random dude just tried to get in my car #sfpriusproblems,' tweeted @urchkin. San Francisco isn't the only city where a certain hybrid Toyota is simply assumed to be an Uber. 'As if I needed more evidence of the monotonous ubiquity of the Los Angeles Prius, today, I was mistaken for someone's Uber driver,' @wlsalyers. Some drivers have even felt the Uber Effect multiple times, suggesting this side effect is hardly rare. Ooops: The problem gets a lot of complaints in San Francisco, but Uber's popularity means it's cropping up all over . Annoying: Some victims of the Uber Effect say they've been struck multiple times . Not just Uber: The service's competitor Lyft is causing the mix-ups, too--though Lyft cars, at least outside of New York City, feature an unmistakable pink mustache on the grill . 'Tonight marks the second time a random person has tried to get in my car because they thought I was an Uber driver,' tweeted @jamiecoletta. 'THE SECOND TIME.' The San Francisco company is an uber success story. From a $330 million valuation in 2011 to a $3.4 billion valuation this month, the service has become ubiquitous in cities large and small across America. However, the company has a competitor in second-fiddle Lyft, which appears to be having an effect of its own. '""Are you Lyft? OH MY GOD YOU'RE NOT."" - the woman who got in my car while I was trying to park,' tweeted Buzzfeed's Louis Peitzman. Uber's popularity suggests its awkward side effect won't likely go away easily. In November 2011, the company was valuated at $330 million. This month, investors said its worth had spiked to over $3 billion .","Twitter has become rife with complaints about their regular cars being invaded by car service app users .

"Forced to fight other dogs in Afghanistan, and beaten and mutilated by uncaring humans, Wylie the dog was on the brink of death. But since being rescued by British soldiers from the former Taliban stronghold of Kandahar, the plucky mongrel has become a star performer. After being whisked to safety in England, Wylie has now won an award run by the Kennel Club - and could be set for even more glory. Triumph: The four-year-old mongrel won the Crossbreed rosette and is now heading to the overall finals . Previously neglected: This is Wylie pictured immediately after he was rescued from a Taliban stronghold . The four-year-old dog yesterday triumphed in the Best Crossbreed Rescued dog class event staged in the Scruffts competition at London’s Earls Court. Scruffts is the crossbreed competition run alongside Crufts, which is for pedigree dogs - and Wylie will now next March be one of the six finalists for the title of overall Scruffts champion. Some 1,200 dogs were entered at the start of the competition. When he was found, Wylie had suffered as his ears and tail were cut off, and had been brutally beaten. Happy: He now lives with owner Sarah Singleton in Yeovil. They travelled together to London for the contest . Saved: He was discovered by Nowzad Dogs charity in 2011. They have saved a further 550 Afghan dogs . But a charity named Nowzad Dogs and run by former Marine Commando Pen Farthing leapt in to save him, along with another 550 Afghan dogs it has now rescued and sent to happy new lives in the developed world. Wylie was first spotted at a bazaar in Kandahar in February 2011, where British troops came across a crowd watching a dog fight. Poor Wylie was being beaten with sticks to encourage him to rejoin the fray. Rescued: Wylie was living in a Taliban stronghold in Kandahar when British troops found him alone and hungry . Happy: Wylie's new life in Somerset includes regular walks, lots of cuddles and a caring new owner . On a roll: He has already won a few regional rounds and had a starring role in this year's Crufts competition . Celebration: Members of the charity that found Wylie celebrate as Miss Singleton presents his award . After he was patched up he was set free - but returned with new injuries. The pattern repeated itself until he was handed to Nowzad, who sent him back to Britain, to kennels in the West Country. He was eventually given a home by Sarah Singleton, 35, a groom and retail worker from Yeovil Somerset, who described her relationship with him as a ‘love affair with a lovely dog’. Miss Singleton said: ‘Wylie is a stray feral dog from Afghanistan and despite all the abuse and human inflicted trauma, he has a wonderful temperament and is incredibly friendly with people. ‘He now lives happily with me and my other two dogs. Despite everything he’s been through he is a gentle, trusting dog who loves everyone.’","Mongrel rescued from Taliban stronghold in Kandahar by soldiers .

"The world is watching on in horror as the conflict between Israel and Gaza escalates – and its devastating impact has now reached space. Looking down from his perch on the International Space Station 200 miles (320km) above Earth, astronaut Alexander Gerst was yesterday able to see rockets lighting up the troubled area. Gerst tweeted an image of the horrifying scenes describing it as his ‘saddest photo yet’. Scroll down for video . Tel-Aviv is pictured on the centre of the coastline at the top of the image. The city lights of Be'er Shiva can be seen towards the centre left, while the Gaza Strip appears as a darker patch running along the coast to the far left. Jerusalem is directly below Tel-Aviv as the main patch of lights in the centre. Hebron is shown to Jerusalem's left, while the sprawl of lights from Amman are shown on the bottom right . Rockets can apparently be seen firing between Israel and Gaza – although Nasa has said it still needs to verify the image. The densely populated areas are highlighted. ‘From ISS we can actually see explosions and rockets flying over Gaza and Israel,’ Gerst wrote on the Twitter caption . The ISS' lofty vantage point has given it access to many scenes of conflict since its permanent habitation began in 2000. For instance, astronauts watched on in horror when they saw the terror attacks in New York on Sept 11, 2001. Poignant footage from space showed smoke rising from New York's Twin Towers, moments after two planes smashed into them in the terror attack which killed thousands of people. In 2008, cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko used a used a 800mm telephoto lens to take images of the South Ossetia region shortly after Russian forces invaded Georgia. The image shows Tel-Aviv near the centre with the city lights of Be'er Shiva seen towards the centre left. The Gaza Strip runs along the coast to the far left of the photo. Disturbingly, many of the explosions are seen in the densely populated regions. Rockets can apparently be seen firing between Israel and Gaza – although Nasa has said it still needs to verify the image. Gerst is a German flight engineer, geophysicist and volcanologist who has so far spent six months aboard the ISS. In this image, Hebron is seen in the centre as the main sprawl of lights, while Tel Aviv is on the bottom left by the coast and Gaza on the bottom right. Alexander Gerst’s photo appeared just as the UN warned Israel may have committed war crimes in its attack against Hamas in Gaza. ‘There seems to be a strong possibility that international law has been violated, in a manner that could amount to war crimes,’ said Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner for human rights . ‘From ISS we can actually see explosions and rockets flying over Gaza and Israel,’ he wrote on the Twitter caption. Alexander Gerst's image went viral on Twitter, with many expressing their horror at the wide-reaching mark the conflict has left . The 16-day conflict has now claimed the lives of 718 Palestinians, most of them civilians, Palestinian health officials say. Israel has lost 32 soldiers, all since July 17, when it widened its air campaign into a full-scale ground operation aimed at halting rocket fire from Gaza. Gerst’s photo appeared just as the UN warned that Israel may have committed war crimes in its attack against Hamas in Gaza. ‘There seems to be a strong possibility that international law has been violated, in a manner that could amount to war crimes,’ Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said. However she went on to say that Hamas had also been violating international law by attacking civilian areas. ‘Israeli children, their parents and other civilians have a right to live without the constant fear that a rocket from Gaza may land on their houses or schools, killing or injuring them,' she said. Israel has denied having a policy of deliberately targeting civilians, blaming Hamas for using civilians as ‘human shields’ to protect its munitions, and claimed it warns targets first with either a 'knock on the roof', text messages of phone calls. But Ms Pillay said: 'A number of incidents, along with the high number of civilian deaths, belies the [Israeli] claim that all necessary precautions are being taken to protect civilian lives.","Astronaut Alexander Gerst tweeted an image of rockets firing between Israel and Gaza while on board the ISS .
