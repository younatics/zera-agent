"By . Shona Sibary . The first time it happened, I was eight years old and on the beach with my father and my best friend, Marnie. Dad suggested a running race, drawing the start line with a piece of wood in the sand. ‘Ready, steady...’ and Marnie was off. My fury at her getting an unjust lead was only fuelled by my father cheering her on, blithely ignoring the fact that she had so blatantly cheated. She won, of course. And I’ll never forget him saying ‘it’s because she’s taller than you. She’s a better runner.’ Prince Charming: Shona (right) pictured with her Mum and Dad, who would flatter Shona's friends and bowl them over with his charisma . Marnie threw me a look — one that clearly said: ‘I’ve got your dad wrapped round my little finger.’ And so she had. It was a fact of my life; something that happened whenever I invited a friend round. To say that my father, a great raconteur, put on a show for my female friends would be an understatement. From the moment they stepped over the threshold he would turn on the charm, directing all his wit and humour in their direction. Which was fine. Usually it was me who basked in the glow of his unfailing good nature and I knew how special it made me feel. Dormant emotions: Her father's actions made Shona so mad that she has only recently acknowledged them again . But when friends came over, his spotlight beamed on them. I’m not suggesting that his behaviour was inappropriate. He wasn’t flirting at this stage. It was more a desire for some sort of adulation from my peers. He would flatter them and bowl them over with his unarguable charisma. It drove me absolutely mad. So mad, in fact, that it has only taken a recent article in society magazine Tatler to bring all those dormant emotions flooding back three decades on. In a feature entitled ‘Ten Charm Rules’, the magazine’s teen supplement blatantly encourages girls as young as 13 to flirt with their friends’ fathers, telling them that ‘the big secret to getting on in life’ is to make other people’s parents like you. The article advises its young readers to ‘take half an hour to flirt (gently) with the parent of the opposite sex and then write a witty thank-you letter — bingo, you’re a winner’. It continues: ‘Word will get out and you’ll be invited everywhere — dinners, more country weekends, swanky holidays and so on, and so on …’ My family didn’t own a country pile or jet off on expensive holidays. But that didn’t stop my friends simpering at my father whenever he happened to stroll into a room. And the older we got, the worse it became. He didn’t need any encouragement and neither, it seemed, did they. How I wished he would just go away and leave us all alone like other dads did. And, to my horror, my friends were always more than keen to stop talking to me about Richard Gere or Duran Duran and turn their attention to whatever my father wanted to bore them with — usually, tales of his brief film career (he was a bit-part actor in the Sixties) or some other equally tedious anecdote from his past. What girl wants her father stealing the limelight? And why couldn’t my friends at least look a little bored? Stealing the limelight: Shona felt uncomfortable with the attention her friends gave her father . There were other emotions, too, that I couldn’t fully understand. One of the . ways Dad would try to impress my friends was by belittling me, making . me the butt of his jokes. It was always done with a smile and I’m sure . wasn’t intended to hurt me. The . result, however, was that he would make my friends howl with laughter. Suddenly, it was them against me and they weren’t yet mature enough to . put peer loyalty above trying to impress a parent. Perhaps . I was just over-sensitive, but I grew to hate the banter. Admittedly it . made me feel a little jealous but also slightly uncomfortable, as if I . were a gooseberry on my own play dates. By . the time I was 17, my father had turned to open flirtation with one of . my more attractive schoolfriends. Why, I have no idea. At the time, his . marriage to my mother seemed happy; perhaps he thought it was funny. At . any rate, I found it excruciating and so spent a lot of time at my . friend’s house instead, where her father largely ignored us. Yet I couldn’t keep my friends and my . father apart for ever. And to my horror, when I was 18 a pal of mine . took a shine to my dad. My parents had recently separated — a decision prompted largely by my mother, who moved out of our five-bedroom home into a one-bedroom flat in a nearby West Sussex village. They were having a rough patch and, looking back, I suspect she was hoping my father would beg her to return. He didn’t. What he did, however, was mope around feeling understandably sorry for himself. I was home after dropping out of my first year of university and landed myself a junior writer’s job on the local paper, where I befriended an outgoing redhead called Sue. We had been at the same school, but she was in the year above me, so until then we hadn’t had much to do with each other. That changed as we bonded over tedious council meetings and my frustrations at the sorry demise of my parents’ marriage as I watched Dad rattling around our home, sorrowfully griddling fish fingers for himself every night. Forgiveness: Although things improved between Shona and her Dad, she was never able to forgive her friend Sue . Then one night she ended up staying over. I can remember, in the morning, standing on the landing, hearing my Dad tell her a joke in the kitchen — the first time I’d heard him laugh in months. And then glancing towards my parents’ bedroom, its door wide open, duvet askew, the bed clearly slept in on both sides. The door to the spare bedroom, where Sue should have spent the night, was firmly shut. Who, I remember wondering, shuts a bedroom door when coming out of it in the morning? I knew that all it would take was for me to turn the handle and look. Then I would see the smooth eiderdown my mother had bought at a craft fair. A bed carefully made up for a friend, but a bed I was convinced had not been slept in. In that moment I hated both of them. Her for betraying our friendship, and him for crossing a line that I never in a million years thought he would dare to cross. During the next few days I confronted both of them and they vehemently denied anything had happened. It was only when I popped out one lunchtime to buy my father a birthday present — a new radio alarm clock for his bedside table — and Sue said: ‘Has his other one broken?’ that the truth finally came out. The look of horror on her face at this slip would almost have been funny if I hadn’t felt so shocked. To her credit, she did apologise and tried to explain that it was a moment of madness — a one-night stand she deeply regretted. But I felt they had both acted with complete disregard for my feelings, then treated me like an idiot by lying about what had happened. Part of me felt vindicated — I’d had suspicions all along. But I couldn’t get over this overwhelming sense I’d been let down in the worst possible way. It was supposed to be Sue and me sharing secrets, not Sue and my father. I tried to continue living with Dad and to see things from his point of view. He was having a crisis, fair enough. But he never once said sorry. Eventually, things just became too difficult at home and I decided to move out and rent a room in a house with people my own age. I still saw Sue at work, but we no longer socialised. I just couldn’t get over the image of her having sex with my dad. Daughters of her own: Because of her experiences Shona is more aware how her own husband acts around her teenage daughters' friends (Shona's dad pictured with one of Shona's daughters, then aged two) Of course, we were all adults by this stage and you might argue that I had no good reason to feel so wronged. Yet it is still hard to explain how devastated I felt. Things with my Dad did, eventually, improve — you can’t choose your family, after all. But I chose to avoid Sue and haven’t spoken to her for years. Now I have two teenage daughters of my own and I suppose it’s natural that I am more aware of how my husband, Keith, behaves around their friends. Thankfully, he pays very little attention. I’m sure they view him as middle-aged and dull. Which is as it should be. I hope teenage girls will take Tatler’s terrible advice with a pinch of salt — not just because hair-flicking and batting one’s eyes at a friend’s father is deeply uncool, but because even if your friend looks as if she doesn’t care, it will matter to her very much indeed. Trust me, I should know.","Shona's dad would turn on the charm when her friends came round .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . If heights aren’t your thing, you might want to steer clear of a new skyscraper in China. Hitachi have announced they are to build the world’s fastest ultra-high-speed elevator in the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre in Guangzhou, China. The building will be completed in 2016, and inside will be the rapid lifts that can climb 95 floors in just 43 seconds. The Guangzhou CTF finance Centre, artist's illustration shown, will house the world's fastest elevator. Built by Hitachi it will be capable of ascending at 1,200 metres per minute . The Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre is an upscale mixed-use skyscraper that will provide office, hotel and residential space. In total the giant structure will have 111 above-ground floors and five below-ground floors. It is being built in the city’s Tianhe District, with the goal of fully opening the building in 2016. While it is not the tallest skyscraper in the world, its elevators will certainly be something to behold. In total the structure will have 95 elevators but only two will hold the accolade of being the world’s fastest. #5: John Hancock Center – Chicago, USAHeight: 1,129 feet (344 metres)Speed: 20.5 mph (33 kph)Ground to roof: 38 seconds*#4: China World Trade Center Tower III – Beijing, ChinaHeight: 1,083 feet (330 metres)Speed: 22 mph (35 kph)Ground to roof: 33 seconds*#3: Burj Khalifa – Dubai, United Arab EmiratesHeight: 2,717 feet (828 metres)Speed: 22 mph (35 kph)Ground to roof: 82 seconds*#2: Taipei 101 – Taipei, TaiwanHeight: 1,670 feet (509 metres)Speed: 37.7 mph (60.1 kph)Ground to roof: 30 seconds*#1: Guangzhou CTF Financial Centre – Guangzhou, China (to be completed 2016)Height: 1,739 feet (530 metres)Speed: 44 mph (70 kph)Ground to roof: 43 seconds* . *If travelling at full velocity . The elevators are powered by a magnet synchronous motor, which allows for the high output needed to attain the high speeds. At maximum velocity the elevators will ascend at nearly 4,000 ft (1,200 metres) per minute. This is equivalent to 44mph (70kph). When descending the elevators are slightly slower at 2,000ft (600 m) per minute, or 22.4mph (36 kph). The elevators will climb from the ground floor to the 95th, and they will be able to make the journey in 43 seconds. Hitachi say the elevator will have technologies that support safe and comfortable elevator operation, so passengers will have a comfortable ride even at these high speeds. The company has a history of making speedy climbers – back in 1968 it designed Japan’s fastest elevator at the time in the Kasumigaseki Building, which travelled at a rather more sedate 980 feet (300 metres) per minute. There will be a variety of safety measures in their latest elevator. These include braking systems and emergency stop devices that can detect excessive speeds. The brakes have outstanding heat resistance too -  even in the unlikely event of a malfunction, they can stop the elevator during high-speed operation. To retain a level of comfort, guide rollers in four corners of the elevator car can also detect sideways vibrations due to wind pressure. And to prevent a person's ears popping, Hitachi will change the air pressure in the car as it ascends and descends. Construction on the CTF Guangzhou building, previously the Chow Tai Fook Centre, began in 2010 (picture taken on 23 December 2012) and is due for completion in 2016 .","A new skyscraper in China will have the fastest ultra-high-speed elevator .

"By . Katy Winter . An 11-year-old schoolgirl who was clinically obese has lost 6st and is now set to compete as a swimmer in the Junior Olympic Games. Just 14 months ago, Breanna Bond from Clovis, California, weighed 14st but has since overhauled her diet and embraced exercise. Her size made her the victim of cruel taunts from school bullies and as she continued to pile on the pounds, her mother Heidi decided it was time to take action. Breanna's 14st frame (right)  used to see her bullied at school, but she has managed to shed 6st (left) Breanna is now set to compete as a swimmer in the Junior Olympic Games after qualifying for the 500-yard freestyle swimming competition . Now, after ditching junk food and exercising regularly, Breanna weighs a healthy 8st. And remarkably she has set her sights on an Olympic medal after qualifying for the 500-yard freestyle swimming competition at the Junior Olympic Games. Her incredible transformation has also seen her became a successful tri-athlete and cheerleader. She said: ‘I feel like I can move more in sports now and it’s a lot easier for me in cheerleading and cross country. I can just go faster.’ Breanna was just two years old when Heidi noticed her daughter was gaining weight faster than children her own age. Even at a very young age, Breanna seemed to be gaining weight faster than her peers . With the help of her mother (pictured with Breanna, right) she has ditched the junk food and eats healthily . By the age of nine, she was so large she was being bullied at school. Heidi said: ‘I thought maybe it could have been a thyroid issue, maybe some kind of genetic disorder. ‘Because it seemed like Breanna was gaining weight faster than her friends. I always thought it was medical. Breanna (front centre) now is a healthy weight and has joined her local cheerleading team . Breanna hopes to inspire other children to get active and lose weight through a website started by her mother . Beanna's incredible transformation has also seen her became a successful tri-athlete and cheerleader . ‘But I hadn’t taken into consideration how much fat I would put in everything. We would make fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, and chicken fried steak.’ Breanna no longer eats junk food and doesn’t miss the fast food restaurants she used to frequent. In fact her healthy new lifestyle proved so inspiring her own family now eat better and exercise more. As well as starting a website to help other overweight children to loose weight, Breanna's journey has inspired her own family to make healthy changes . Heidi said: ‘One day we just decided to go for a family walk. Little by little we increased the number of days that we would do that.’ They have now launched a website, www.Breannabond.com, dedicated to Breanna’s weight-loss journey in a bid to inspire other children who are overweight. Heidi explained: ‘It’s an inspirational site to help encourage other children everywhere to get motivated, to exercise and to lose the weight.’","By age 10 weighed 14st and was being bullied at school .

"By . Shona Sibary . Late one night, lying in bed, I was on the verge of dropping off to sleep when my iPhone suddenly vibrated on the bedside table beside me. It was nearly midnight. Who could possibly be texting at this hour? For a fleeting moment I wondered whether to just leave it. But with a teenage daughter 70 miles away at boarding school, a mother's instinct made me reach for the phone. What I saw in that moment seemed, on the surface, innocuous enough. But it was to signal the start of a five-day rollercoaster of eye-popping revelations and enough parental angst to turn every hair on my head permanently grey. Scroll down for video: How to set up iCloud on your child's phone . Wake-up call: Shona was shocked when she read text messages her daughter Annie exchanged with boys . The text - from a boy called Tom - read: 'Hey babe. OMG! Did you really escape last night? Your (sic) mad. AHAHA A... What time did you go into town?' Then, before I had a chance to digest what I was seeing, a reply. '2am! It was cool. AHAHA.' By now, I was wide awake. For one tiny, lovely second I convinced myself I had experienced the equivalent of an old-fashioned crossed line - that the texts I'd received were meant for someone else's errant child. But there was no denying the name on the top of this delightful exchange; that of my 13-year-old daughter, Annie. You may wonder - as did I - why I was suddenly receiving all her text messages. The following morning, my husband Keith got to the bottom of what was going on. A few days earlier we had upgraded Annie's old mobile to an iPhone 4s. As anybody with an Apple device will know, there is this wonderful creation called iCloud, which can sync together Apple products. Right to read? Shona couldn't resist when Annie's messages were sent to her mobile . Because of this, Annie's mobile number was automatically logged in my settings menu as the account holder and also ticked, unbeknown to me, under the messages option. I defy any responsible parent not to consider this a serendipitous turn of events. No mother wants to stoop so low as having to secretly spy on their daughter's online activity, but, deep down, we all wish we knew what they were up to when they have no idea we can see. But it only took 24 hours before I was reminded of that old adage: be careful what you wish for. Because later that evening, long after lights-out at her all-girls boarding house, the texts started up again. The first was from a charming chap called Jake. 'Shame your (sic) not going to the party on Saturday night coz TBH woz gonna bring my condoms.' Then one back from Annie: 'Ahaha. Your (sic) too kind but WTF?' Speechless, I handed the phone over to Keith to read and watched as his face went puce. Then, in a moment of breathtaking innocence, he turned to me and asked: 'What does TBH mean?' For those who don't have the time to decipher teenage acronyms, TBH means 'to be honest'. WTF means 'What the f***'. A suitably comforting response, I felt, from my daughter. But things were about to get a lot worse. 'Wanna play the truth game?' sent from Jake. At this point everything was telling me I should turn the phone off and remain in blissful ignorance. Keith, echoing my thoughts, said: 'This is really bad. We should stop looking now.' Then he paused. 'Pass the phone.' 'R u a dirty smoker?' Jake asked. By now I had my hands over my face, peeping through my fingers. Two seconds later Annie pinged back: 'Pahaha. Not dirty, just normal.' It's hard to know how, to react when faced with a side to your daughter you never thought you would see. Of all our four children, Annie has always seemed the easiest. Happy-go-lucky, sports-mad, not in the least bit rebellious. If I was to take this communication at face value, my lovely girl had morphed into a swearing, smoking, sex-mad escapologist with incredibly poor grammar. As usual when it comes to parenting matters, Keith's reaction differed to mine. My gut feeling was to call the school, haul Annie out and interrogate her. He argued the texts could be teenage bravado. We'd brought this dilemma on ourselves. Do nothing and we risked never knowing what she was really up to. Confront Annie and we could alienate her. Insight: Teen texting is a world of poor grammar, swearing and sexual innuendo (posed by model) I'm sure there are many parents reading this and leaping to judge our duplicitous actions. But let me ask you this. What is worse? Seizing a rare opportunity to get a glimpse into your child's life, or sticking your parental head in the ground? Friends were firm advocates of the latter. 'I'd rather not know,' one mother told me. 'Frankly, it's the stuff of nightmares.' By day three, I was inclined to agree. The world of teenage instant messaging is one you enter at your peril. For starters every other word is interjected with 'ahaha' or 'pahaha' - a demonstration of laughter. Harmless enough. Then there's the endless boy-girl banter. I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised. Except I naively assumed she didn't know any boys. 'U r fit,' one boy texted her. 'Thanx babe,' she replied with all the insouciance of a seasoned flirt. In another text she asked a boy called Ben: 'Do you like me?' I had just enough time to think: 'Well, that’s sweet,' before he pinged back: 'Yer, I'd do u.' Throughout all this Keith was, I sensed, in paternal turmoil. Personally, I had no moral issue with what we were doing. We were, after all, paying for the phone. He, on the other hand, worried if Annie found out she would never trust us again.  My concerns felt more fundamental. What was keeping me awake at night, clutching my phone, was the concern that my daughter was turning into a tart and veering spectacularly off the rails. Text mania . 145 billion texts were sent in the UK in 2013 . Luckily, a weekend home from boarding school was approaching. As you can imagine, I was desperate to see Annie, but if her texts were anything to go by the feeling wasn't reciprocated. 'Have to go home this weekend (sad face). Boring.' This was a slap in the face but, probably, served me right. After all, what you don't know can't hurt you. Things came to a head that following weekend. Annie's face went from shock, through to horror, through to outrage as the penny slowly dropped. 'Are you smoking and who are Ben, Jake and Tom?' I ranted as she cried. I stopped short of asking her if she was having sex - the very notion of it being a possibility was so horrendous I just couldn't form the words. She made a breathtakingly brazen attempt to protest along the lines that what we had done was wholly unacceptable. She even tried to argue about privacy rights - something which caused Keith to take her phone and shove it in a drawer. Too much information: Shona won't be looking at her daughter's messages again (posed by model) Afterwards, feeling frazzled, we went for a long dog-walk. 'It's just banter and teenage stuff Mum,' she told me. I believed her. I know, ultimately, that Annie is a great girl with a sensible head on her shoulders. Which, I suppose, just begs the question - what did all this achieve? Perhaps it is better to simply trust and leave things there. Teenagers will always behave differently with their peers. It's just, in my day, my mother luckily never knew anything about it. So Annie has her phone back with a stern lecture on online behaviour. And I have unticked her number in my settings,. I did this with a huge sense of relief because my week as a tourist in the land of adolescent acronyms and hormonal repartee was such hell I never want to go back there again.","Annie's messages came through to Shona's mobile by accident .

"By . Shona Sibary . At the beginning of this month, my youngest child, Dolly, started school. Her tiny hand clutched mine as I urged her into the reception class and hung the blazer that swamps her still-tiny frame on to a peg. Then, steeling myself, I quickly departed to brave the inevitable huddle of sobbing mothers in the playground - all bereft that their days of toddler groups and coffee mornings had finally come to an end. By rights, I should have joined them in shedding a tear or two. Dolly is, after all, my fourth and last child. She is also, having just turned four at the end of August, the youngest in the entire school. School run sadness: Shona with Dolly, who's just turned four but is already going to school . Yet distraught was the very furthest from how I felt. As I gave these women a cheery wave my, actual, overriding thought was: 'Hurrah! That's the last one out of my hair.' So why have I decided to make Dolly start school even though she still requires a dummy for comfort and wears nappies every night? The answer's simple. After 14 years of fitting my writing career around my brood's needs, I've had enough. The main reason she's going to school is because, shamefully, it makes my life a hell of a lot easier. I know this makes me sound heartless. Even I'm surprised at my behaviour. Especially because the entire reason we decided to have Dolly was so that I could give up work and savour every precious moment with one last child. She was born in August 2009 - almost seven years after the youngest of her siblings: Monty, ten, Annie, 12, and Flo, 14. After the madness of having three children so close together I craved to experience motherhood at a leisurely pace. I desperately wanted to try the whole stay-at-home thing. But then money worries drove me back to work when she was just ten weeks old. Poor Dolly went to nursery and I went back to my laptop. Perhaps if I'd been a hands-on mother from the off, spending my days doing nothing more stressful than making things out of Play-Doh, I might feel differently now. But the truth is that for me, and the majority of working mothers in the UK, the start of school comes as a blessed relief because it allows us - by law and general acceptance - to get on with our jobs with far less hassle and expense. Today, there's no escaping the sense of freedom I feel at being able to drive away from the school drop-off knowing that the last of my offspring is squirrelled away for the next six hours and the day is all mine. There are no complicated childcare arrangements to arrange and no guilt to contend with. I have convinced myself that my darling little girl is exactly where she should be. So imagine my shock when I read last week that a coalition of education experts are now calling for full-time school to be delayed - by an astonishing three years. Liberating: Shona loves the sense of freedom sending Dolly off to school gives her . The Save Childhood Movement, which has launched a Too Much, Too Soon campaign, firmly believes that the current UK education system is causing young children 'profound damage', because they are not being encouraged to learn through play. Apparently the pressure of being in a classroom is too stressful for four years olds like Dolly. What they would like to see is for full-time school to be delayed - as it is in countries like Finland - until a child is six or seven. Firstly, have none of these experts ever tried to hold down a job while juggling the demands and eye-watering cost (more expensive than private school) of a pre-schooler needing childcare? And, secondly, don't they know that Finland has one of the highest rates of alcoholism in the whole of Europe? I'll wager there's a connection there. Every working mother in Britain knows how stressful it is to continue a career with a small person metaphorically - and literally - clinging to your skirt hems. Booting them out to full-time education a little early is surely preferable to hitting the bottle? Yet many will argue that I am a bad mother for shunting my daughter through a system she doesn't even - legally - have to be in yet. And I'd probably concede they have a point. You just have to look at Dolly's furrowed brow in the mornings, or  the fact she falls asleep on the sofa at 6pm before I’ve even put her in the bath and read her a story. After her first day at school she came home, wide-eyed with horror. 'If you do something naughty you get a red card,' she whispered, terrified. I still have no idea what a red card means because Dolly's too little to understand herself. I could, of course, keep her at home. Current UK law dictates that a child doesn't have to be in full-time education until they are five. Yet you are strongly encouraged to start your children the September after their fourth birthday, and most parents happily oblige. Either they're like me - desperate to claw back some career credibility - or just so competitive they can't bear the idea of their child being on an educational back foot because they've started behind their classmates. All schools are different. We've gone private, which has afforded us some flexibility on the matter. The school's attitude is that I'm a paying customer and can therefore call the shots. They've been amazing in their approach, telling me I can dip Dolly in and out of her reception year however it best suits me. I can keep her home a day a week or pick her up early if she seems a little tired. But friends with children in the state sector haven't been so lucky. Some primary schools do stagger entry for summer babies allowing them to attend for half days until January - but after that they're just expected to get with the programme. I know, deep down, that Dolly isn’t ready for school. But so liberating does it feel to get my life back that, despite the school's offer, I plonk her at their gates at 8.30am every morning, when I drop off her older brother and sister, and don't return to collect her until 5pm. While the school day finishes at 4pm, she does an hour of after-school clubs so I can pick her up at the same time as her siblings. LATE STARTERS . As well as Sweden, children in Denmark and Finland don't start school until they’re seven . I did, at the start of term, flirt with the idea of keeping her home on, say, a Wednesday, but it's amazing how my week fills up. I'm not saying I don't feel guilty. On the drive to school, Dolly sucks desperately on her dummy like a death row prisoner having his last fag. As we arrive and I try to prise it from her mouth she begs: 'One last suck, Mummy,' before dejectedly leaving it behind in her car seat. Of course, I adore my daughter and want to hang on to her early years as long as I possibly can. I also have a 14-year-old teenage girl, so I know how fast it whizzes by. And it does, occasionally, tear at my heartstrings when I drop her off in the morning and turn back to see her standing, stoically, in the centre of the playground. She looks so small, so unsure what to do amid the throng of much older, bigger and more boisterous children. Several times I have even been tempted to rush back, scoop her up in my arms and take her home for a day of cuddles and Mummy time. But then I remember I need a quiet day to meet my deadlines. So this morning I entered her bedroom with my usual sense of purpose, trying to ignore the fact she was on her stomach, just as she slept when she was a baby, her knees drawn up under her. 'Come on Dolly,' I said, pulling back the duvet. 'It's time for school.' She opened both eyes, looked at me sorrowfully and said: 'But Mummy, I already went, yesterday.' I just didn't have the heart to break the news to her that yes - despite this indisputable fact - she has to go today, and tomorrow, too.","Dolly turned four in August and still wears nappies .

"By . Shona Sibary . Yesterday I woke to an azure blue sky, the sun beaming down on my lovely North Devon farmhouse. It should have been the perfect beach day. We do, after all, live just five minutes from one of the country’s most impressive stretches of sand. Alternatively, I could have relaxed in my garden enjoying the view of the estuary, boats bobbing, and happy holidaymakers out on the water. But no such luck. Because, with yet another stream of people arriving to stay, what I actually did was this: strip five beds; put three loads of laundry into the washing machine; scrub toilets; dry bedding on the line; re-make said beds (two of which are bunks, and absolutely back breaking to put fitted sheets on); dash to the supermarket to restock on food and wine; buy flowers for the spare bedroom; pick up dog poo from the garden; hoover and marinade meat for an evening barbecue. Rural idyll: Shona at home in her rambling old farmhouse in Devon on a houseguest-free morning . You might wonder if I am running some sort of guesthouse establishment or, indeed, a small boutique hotel. Well, in many ways it feels as if I am. Welcome to chez Sibary. We are not in the AA guide and have no rosettes on the wall outside. But it appears we do have vacancies the entire summer and, yes, breakfast is always included. I am, of course, talking about the dreaded holiday houseguest. They come in many guises but by far the worst, and most annoying, are the 'passers-by'. The phone call usually comes at some point in the morning. I had one just last week. It was a family from Surrey whom I vaguely knew through my son Monty’s old school. 'Hello! Remember us?' the mother trilled. Well, only just, I thought. She continued. 'You know, we met at that Christmas party last year. Our son, Archie, was in the year below?' By now the penny is dropping. 'Well, the thing is,' she says, 'we’re just passing by on our way to Cornwall and thought we’d drop in and see how you’re coping with Devon life!' An hour later, a car laden with surfboards and bicycles pulls up and said family of four spills out onto our driveway. 'Gosh,' the mother says, doing a quick assessment of how large our farmhouse is. 'We didn’t realise the journey would be so tiring.' Before I have time to think 'What’s your name again?' they have hung up their Joules fleeces in the boot-room and are making noises about staying the night. They offer to pitch their tent in the garden and promise to be 'no trouble at all'. But two days later they are still lingering, it’s pouring with rain outside and I can see that the thought of moving on from us to a campsite is looking less appealing by the minute. Guests: For Shona Sibary, the joy has gone out of entertaining thanks to the stream of visitors since January . Stressful: Juggling the needs of guests with work and family life has taken its toll on Shona . I did, eventually, get rid of them. But only by claiming that my daughter, Dolly, had diarrohea — nothing like the threat of a bug to evacuate the property. Of course, I could have put my foot down earlier. Or simply said 'no'. And, probably, we only have ourselves to blame. Back in January when we decided to up sticks for a life by the coast, the 800-year old, Grade Two listed farmhouse we are now in felt like the last place anyone would visit. Yes, we could see the sea from its remote, rural position at the top of a hill, but all the trees in the garden were horizontal from the wind, it was blowing a howling gale and I had to pick my way through numerous cowpats to get to the front door. I remember turning to my husband, Keith, and saying: 'You do realise that if we move here nobody will want to come and see us.' Famous last words. Fast-forward six months, throw in a heatwave and it feels as if my entire address book has eaten me out of house and home. In the past three months alone we have had 17 sets of houseguests come to stay. It’s total madness. For it’s a very different picture in August. The ice-cream van on the seafront has opened, the seagulls are no longer being flung past our bedroom window by a sixty-mile-an-hour wind and there is a definite feel of summer holiday in the air. Oh, to enjoy it. But this, it seems, is the preserve of the houseguest. My job, as hostess, is to run around in circles providing endless meals and being a one-woman tourist information centre on hand to help with everything from tide timetables to the best place for a spot of crabbing. The problem is that we not only live in a relatively sought after holiday destination (Westward Ho! is ten minutes in one direction, Croyde beach twenty minutes in the other) but we are also just off the A39 which, as any of you who have ever driven to the West Country will know, is the North Devon Link Road — rather aspirationally labelled The Atlantic Highway. It is this stretch of road that every family from the Home Counties will, at some point, barrel down in order to reach the more salubrious parts of Cornwall like Padstow, Rock and the Camel Estuary. Of course, with prices that way being so eye-wateringly high, it makes absolute sense to tag on a little free holiday accommodation either side. Hasn’t Shona moved somewhere down there?I don’t want to sound grumpy and unwelcoming. On the contrary, I would like to think my door is always open to friends and family and that we are the kind of relaxed, laid-back household that can absorb last minute, spontaneous guests with aplomb. But the reality is I have four children at home on summer holiday and a job. Chores: Constant visitors has meant lots of extra cooking and cleaning for Shona - and she's not happy . Hard work: Barbecues have become a constant feature of life and are taking up a lot of Shona's time . I am not, despite appearances, on annual leave. And no. Arriving with one potted chrysanthemum picked up from the nearest garage forecourt is not a sufficient offering if you are going to hang around for four days. And it’s really hard work having houseguests. Just last week, Keith’s father came to stay and complained (in the nicest possible way) that the mattress on the spare bed was a little lumpy. 'I didn’t sleep too well last night,' he mentioned at breakfast. 'I might just chill out in the garden today. Are you barbecuing for lunch?' Perhaps it’s my fault and I should be more blunt. But instead of pointing at the charcoal and saying, 'there you go — help yourself,' I rushed out, bought a new double mattress and stopped at the butcher’s on the way home. It doesn’t surprise me in the least that a recent poll found we spend £5 billion a year putting up visitors. And one in five harassed hosts find their houseguests annoying as well as expensive. Visitors who expect to be waited on and those who make too much noise were deemed the most irritating. This isn’t my biggest bugbear. It’s the fact that when you live somewhere that everybody else goes on holiday to, they either expect you to be on holiday as well or to facilitate their relaxation. The fact that I have a deadline, a garden to mow and four pairs of school shoes to purchase for September falls on the seemingly deaf ears of my Prosecco-sipping houseguests. All they want are long lunches followed by a snooze on the beach. The temptation to join them would be overwhelming if only I didn’t have to dash to the supermarket to buy dinner for eleven before heading home to prepare it. The end is, thankfully, almost in sight. I just have to wave goodbye to my current visitors to do yet another exhausting one-day turnaround in time to welcome the next lot for the Bank Holiday weekend. I was going to say I will then close (and bolt) my front door with a huge sigh of relief. If only! But a distant relative — third cousin, twice removed — called from New Zealand last night 'for a catch up,' and happened to mention, just in passing, that she was planning a UK trip in October. 'I’ve heard Devon is quite nice in the autumn,' she hinted. 'Do you have a spare room?'","Shona has spent the summer battling with endless chores .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Mothers exposed to low levels of lead are more likely to have obese children – and baby boys are the most affected, according to a new study. The effects of lead pollution on the brain and nervous system are already well known. And now researchers at the University of Michigan have found the first link between the metal and weight gain in future generations. Mothers exposed to low levels of lead are more likely to have obese children - and boys are the most affected . There is no safe level of lead for human health, doctors warned last month. Experts are now moving to lower the blood lead level thresholds previously considered safe, in response to international health authorities debating the health effects of low level lead exposure. A report by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) in Australia recommended that blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per decilitre be the indicator used to determine unusual exposure to lead. In 2009, the NHMRC suggested a blood lead level of 10 micrograms per decilitre or higher warranted investigation. The report said that as it was not possible to tell whether low level exposure had meaningful adverse health effects, there is no level that should be considered safe. In an experiment, female mice were exposed to low doses of lead and their offspring were examined and found to have put on weight. Male mice saw an eight to 10 per cent increase in weight. ‘The data supports the obesogen hypothesis that toxicant exposures in the womb contribute to the higher rate of obesity,’ said Dana Dolinoy, Assistant Professor of Environmental Health Sciences at the university. ‘There are certain chemicals that are considered the hallmarks of the obesity epidemic and lead has not been one of them.’ Research Fellow Christopher Faulk added: ‘To see that the level I and others have considered very low has such statistical significance in this study is alarming. ‘There is no minimum safe level for lead. Our research really supports this.’ Lead was once common in paints and petrol until it was banned, but still exists in older homes and in air, water, soil, food and some consumer products. Baby boomers and older adults were once exposed to lead at much higher levels of exposure than today, which are closer to the lower dosage examined in the study. Previous research has shown that lead exposure decreases foetal and early childhood growth in human infants and causes obesity in later life. The new study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, looked at how what a mother ingests, even before pregnancy, impacts her offspring. Experts believe at exposure to chemicals is most serious at conception. In the experiment, female mice were given drinking water that was contaminated with lead two weeks before mating, as well as throughout pregnancy and nursing. Research Fellow Christopher Faulk said: 'There is no minimum safe level for lead. Our research really supports this.' Lead was once common in paints, toys (pictured) and petrol until it was banned, but still exists in older homes and in air, water, soil, food and some consumer products . Their litters were measured at three, six and nine months for energy expenditure, spontaneous activity, food intake and body weight. At nine months they were tested for glucose tolerance. The groups of mice were exposed to lead at 2.1 parts per million (ppm), 16ppm or 32ppm, alongside another group that had no exposure to lead. The study found that from birth, male mice in the two highest exposure groups outweighed the controls going into adulthood and an increase in body fat at all dosages showed up in males at three months. Both sexes exposed to the highest dose ate more than the control group, with males eating more at six months and female food consumption increasing at 9 months. Exposed males showed impaired insulin levels at 9 months and both sexes showed the expected decline in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production as they aged. The female mice exposed to lead had higher energy expenditure at three months and the exposed males had lower energy expenditure at nine months.","University of Michigan scientists link lead to obesity in future generations .

Paranormal: It has been suggested that this photograph, taken in Mrs McDonald's home, shows evidence of the demon she has complained about . Her 22-year-old daughter fled the house saying she could no longer stay in the bedroom because it was haunted by the evil demon. As a result Mrs McDonald was left living alone in the two-bedroom house and therefore became eligible to pay bedroom tax on the extra room. But she says the bedroom in the semi-detached house is unfit for habitation because it is already occupied by the malevolent spirit. However the Government’s rules on ‘under-occupancy’ of bedrooms doesn’t cover paranormal house guests and she is still eligible to pay the charge.

"By . Jack Crone . Dropped in: Xiao Chien calmly sits in the hospital waiting room with a knife wedged into his brain . When Xiao Chien felt a sharp blow to his head while walking down the road, he didn't panic. After investigating the cause of the sudden pain and discovering a large knife protruding from his skull, he calmly decided to stroll on home and call an ambulance. Mr Chien had been walking through Guangyuan City in the province of Sichuan, south-west China, when a woman accidentally dropped a gardening knife from a twelfth floor balcony. The blade, which had been used for trimming plants, plunged into Mr Chien's head with such force, that it embedded itself 12 centimetres into his brain after piercing his skull. On realising what had happened, Mr Chien began his journey home - but only made it 100 metres before stopping because he felt faint. Chinese doctors believe Mr Chien's amazingly composed reaction was a result of the knife damaging the part of his brain that sends out panic signals. At the sight of the dazed Mr Chien, shocked passers-by called emergency services and the injured man was taken to hospital, where surgeons operated to remove the wedged knife. Miraculously, doctors believe he has escaped without any permanent damage. Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Chien told local media: 'I felt a blow to my head and I could see stars for a few seconds. 'When I put my hand up to see if the was any blood I could feel something sticking out of my head. 'I felt remarkably calm about the whole thing, and realised that I couldn't pull it out. The 12-centimetre blade plunged Mr Chien's head up to the hilt -as shown by the shocking x-ray taken when he arrived in hospital . 'I thought maybe the best thing to do would be to go home and call an ambulance but after about hundred metres I felt faint and I had to sit down.' Doctors say Mr Chien's neural functions including eyesight, hearing, touch and cognitive abilities, all seem to be working normally. They added that if there was no sign of infection within a day then he could be released. Miraculous: Mr Chien has been told by doctors that the knife does not appear to have caused permanent damage .

"By . Jack Crone . A mother abandoned her eight-year-old son on a dark street corner with four dollars in his pocket, telling him 'you always wanted me to go away, I'll go away'. Natasha Harrow, 35, dumped Elijah in Manhattan's busy Upper East Side just before 10pm with no intention of going back for him, according to court papers. After wandering the streets for two hours, Elijah was eventually rescued by passers-by, who found him standing alone at the corner of First Ave. and 86th St. Outside Gracie's Corner cafe - where Elijah was rescued by passers-by around midnight - two hours after his mother dumped him . Police were quickly alerted to the incident, which took place on July 22, but were unable to catch up with Harrow for a further two weeks, reported the New York Daily News. The mother, who lives on E. 93rd St., is now being charged with abandonment but police and prosecutors remain confused as to why she ditched her child in the first place. When questioned by police this week, she admitted abandoning Elijah, but contested where she left him. She stated in court papers: 'No, I left him at 96th St. and Second Ave.' The papers go on to say that Harrow 'deserted' Elijah 'with intent to wholly abandon (him).' Harrow, who has one prior arrest on her record, was arraigned on Wednesday and ordered to be held on $3,500 bail on Rikers Island. Elijah is believed to have been dumped by his mother near the corner of First Ave. and 86th St. - almost a mile from their home on E. 93rd St . Elijah was found in front of the shuttered Gracie's Corner cafe, which is about two blocks from Gracie Mansion, police and court papers state. The child is believed to be staying at his grandmother's in Brooklyn while she cares for him. Geraldo Petrie, who manages a florist shop across the street, said: 'This shouldn't happen to any child, especially not in New York City.' 'It hurts our entire city to see a kid get lost or abandoned. At least they found him.'","Natasha Harrow, 35, dumped son, Elijah, in Manhattan around 10pm .

"By . Jack Crone . The last ever class of cranes at a unique school designed to bring back one of Britain's rarest birds are ready to spread their wings after graduating. Environmentalists at the Slimbridge Wetland Centre in Gloucestershire have spent ten weeks taking classes on foraging, feeding and making nests in the wild. After passing their exams, the 16 young avian pupils from the class of 2014 are set to be introduced to a secret wetland location in Somerset. Pecking order: Two common crane chicks battle it out to be top of the class at the Slimbridge Wetland Centre in Gloucestershire . Spreading their wings: The school is part of the Great Crane Project which hopes to restore Eurasian cranes to their former homes before they were driven to extinction in the 16th century by over-hunting and the loss of wetlands . Their graduation marks the end of a five-year initiative launched by the Great Crane Project to boost dwindling numbers of the common crane. In 1980, there were just two wild cranes left in Britain - but through extensive conservation efforts, their population is slowly bouncing back. At Crane School, the birds were given daily exercise and taught how to forage and negotiate the wetlands that will become their wild home. Amy King, head teacher at the sanctuary, said: 'This year's Crane School class has really thrived.' Dinner is served: Keepers at the centre take on the role of mother as they feed the chicks via a stick shaped like a parent crane so the young birds do not become accustomed to people . 'They've loved their daily walks and this year we drafted in 40 volunteer PE teachers who took the birds for more than 700 hours of exercise. 'I've worked with the Great Crane Project since day one and it has been the most unforgettable experience. 'Some of the first birds that I raised have had chicks of their own now. It's just wonderful to know that they're out there, living wild in our landscape once again.' The crane students are hatched from eggs taken from a healthy wild population in Germany. The human teachers take on the role of their natural parents, guiding them through their first few months of life. They wear grey hooded overalls to disguise their human form and feed them via a stick shaped like a parent crane so the young birds do not become accustomed to people. Grub's up: The cranes were also taught how to find their food in an effort to prepare them for life in the wetlands of Somerset . Take off: A pair of young cranes attempt to fly before being introduced to the Somerset Levels and Moors, one of Britain's key wetland areas . After their ten-week course, the birds are taken to the Somerset Levels and Moors where they are introduced to a flock of previous Crane School graduates. It is hoped the crane flock will start to grow naturally as birds reach maturity and start to breed before spreading across Britain. In 2013, environmentalists were left devastated following the death of the first wild crane to be hatched in Western Britain for four centuries. Disaster also struck in June when two newborn chicks died. The common crane is one of Europe’s largest birds with a wingspan of between 1.8 to 2.2 metres (pictured above is a young chick during a lesson using a prosthetic crane head) Damon Bridge, Great Crane Project Manager said: 'With this last class now on the Levels we're all looking forward to the next phase of the project with the cranes settling down to breed and raise youngsters in the wild. 'Putting these iconic birds back in this special place is so exciting. It's a real boost not just for the crane population in the UK, but we hope a symbol of a bright future for the Somerset wetlands.'","'Crane School' opened in 2010 in bid to protect species from extinction .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . When a man from Saudi Arabia kept having nosebleeds, few people could have predicted the cause. The 22-year-old, who suffered nose bleed at least one a month over three years, had a tooth growing in his nose, a report reveals. Doctors found a white bony mass measuring half an inch (1cm) long growing in his nasal cavity. Doctors found a white bony mass measuring half an inch (1cm) long growing in one man's nasal cavity (pictured) which upon closer inspection, dentists proclaimed an extra tooth . A dentist explained that extra teeth are not that unusual, but they rarely grow inside the nose. Up to 3.9 per cent of people have more teeth that usual and they can erupt in unexpected places, according to previous studies. Around a third of mesiodens (a common type of extra tooth found near the incisors) develop upside down and can travel towards the nose. No-one is exactly sure why some people have this problem, but the report says: ‘causes of intranasal teeth include trauma, infection, anatomical malformations, and genetic factors.’ Extra teeth can appear in the palette as a normal looking extra tooth, or can grow into the nasal cavity in rare cases. Symptoms of such a problem include a blocked nose, headaches, nose bleeds, foul-smelling mucus and even external deformities of the nose. Upon seeking advice from dentists, it was confirmed the mass was in fact an extra tooth. It was this that was responsible for the bleeding, they added. The nosebleeds usually occurred after ‘minor nasal trauma’ - or rubbing of the nose - and the patient also frequently had tonsillitis. According to the study,’ an intranasal supernumerary tooth’ was causing friction in an area of the nasal septum, resulting in bleeding. The discovery of the tooth was particularly surprising because the man had a complete and well-aligned set of normal teeth in his mouth, Live Science reported. To solve the problem, doctors from the King Fahd Military Medical Complex, in Dhahran, put the man under general anaesthetic before pulling out the rogue tooth. Three months later, the patient’s nose had healed and his nosebleeds had ceased, according to the report published in the American Journal of Case Reports. Commenting on the case, dentist Dr John Hellstein, who is a professor of oral pathology at the University of Iowa, told LiveScience that while extra teeth are not that unusual, they rarely grow inside the nose. ‘It's an unusual case of an extra tooth - certainly, the most impressive intranasal photo I think I've ever seen of one. I've never seen the tooth actually in there.’ The discovery of the tooth was particularly surprising because the man had a complete and well-aligned set of normal teeth in his mouth. The extra tooth is shown in this CT scan, marked with a red arrow . To stop the man's frequent nose bleeds, doctors put the man under general anaesthetic before pulling out the rogue tooth (pictured) The dentist also remarked that it is surprising that the tooth went undetected for so long. It is thought that the man may have had a mesioden - a common type of extra tooth found near the incisors.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . For most parents, the moment their baby’s umbilical cord is cut is over in seconds. But some families are choosing to dwell over the so-called ‘sacred severance’ by burning the umbilical cord slowly. As bizarre as it sounds, those who have done it claim that cord burning acts as another way of bonding a new family. Families from Santa Cruz, California, are choosing to burn through their baby's umbilical cord using a candle instead of relying on a doctor with a clamp and scissors. Those who have used the 'cord burning' technique say it is a bonding experience. A family that wishes to remain anonymous is pictured . Some families use a 'burn box' (pictured) with grooves to hold candles and collect dripping wax, to make the process safer . Samantha Geston, who lives in Santa Cruz, . California, is among the mothers who have chosen to avoid doctors with a . clamp and scissors to cut the umbilical cord in seconds. Instead, she opted to burn through the cord slowly with a lit candle. The practice has been around in some cultures for hundreds of years as a way of lowering the chance of infection and bleeding after birth. Mrs Geston said that her parents, husband and daughter all took turns at holding the candle underneath the cord, until it burned through in 20 minutes. ‘It was really magical and everyone was . so happy and it was just the perfect way to end a beautiful pregnancy . and a beautiful birth,’ she told Today Parents. Mrs Geston said she was not worried that . her new son would be burned by the flame as the cord was stretched out . away from him so that it was connected to the placenta in a bowl by the . side of the bed.

Here, her husband uses a candle to burn the cord . Mrs Geston said that her parents, husband (pictured) and daughter all took turns at holding the candle underneath the cord, until it burned through in 20 minutes . Cord burning involves people burning through a baby's umbilical cord. It has been done for centuries to lower the risk of infection and bleeding after birth. There are different methods, but cordburning.com recommends positioning the baby on its side. A 'burn box' is placed next to the baby and the umbilical cord in the notches on the side of the box. Candles are lit and placed in a position so that the flames are under the cord. 'There is a sizzling and a little smoke. There will be a ""pop"" at some point then the blood gases escape, which is normal and only happens once,' the website says. The candles sometimes need to be relit if they are extinguished by escaping fluid and the process does create a unique smell. Reports of the practice, depending on the technique used, say it can take between 10 minutes and an hour for the cord to be severed. Parents knot the final piece of remaining cord attached to the baby, which gradually shrivels up and eventually drops off. Some people use a ‘burn box’ with grooves to hold candles and collect dripping wax, to make the process safer. A photographer called Paige Discoll, of Santa Cruz Birth Photography, who is herself expecting a baby, recorded the event and said she too now wants the family event. ‘I want my four boys to be involved in the birth of their baby brother,’ she said. ‘Too many times during birth, everything happens so quickly. 'This is a really slow and gentle process that slows everything down and makes it so memorable.’ Cord . burning was traditionally used to lower the risk of infection after . birth by sterilising the tissue and cauterising blood vessels to stop . bleeding. But modern methods negate the need for the process, Dr Iffath Hoskins of NYU Langone Medical Centre explained. She . noted that there is no reason to stop cord burning as long as . precautions are taken to stop the baby being burnt or the risk of a fire . as the result of the open flame. Experts are divided about the ideal time to cut the cord, but The World Health Organisation suggests that the severance should take place between one and three minutes after birth. Because the blood flow between the baby and the placenta stops quite quickly, the extra time taken to burn the cord does not affect the health of the baby, Dr Hoskins said. A spokesperson for the Royal College of Midwives told MailOnline: 'Normally it takes between three and 25 minutes after the birth for all the blood and nutrients to pass from the placenta to the baby. 'After the baby is born there is no longer any circulation in the placenta, so it’s dead tissue and full of blood - creating the  perfect  environment for bacteria and infection. 'These are the potential risks of cord burning that parents should be aware of, but midwives will always support women and their partners and respect their choices after giving birth.'","Cutting the cord is usually done with a clamp and scissors in seconds .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A mother who made the heartbreaking decision to have her daughter’s legs amputated has spoken of her joy that she is now dancing, running and even cycling on her own. Born without tibia bones in her lower leg, Evie Taylor would have faced severe difficulties walking. But after her mother allowed doctors to amputate her daughter's legs when she was a year old, with prosthetics, Evie can now move around like any other child. Evie Taylor was born missing her tibia bones in her lower leg. Her mother was forced to make the agonising decision to have her daughter's lower limbs totally amputated in order for her to walk easily in the future . Evie was born with Werner Mesomelic Dysplasia, a condition that meant her tibia bones - the second largest bone in the leg - did not form. Doctors warned that she may not be able to walk properly without surgery . Evie has now learnt to dance, run, cycle and even bounce on a trampoline, without any help. Ms Taylor, from Dudley, West Midlands, said: ‘It’s incredible to see how far Evie has come. ‘Signing the form that gave the surgeons permission to amputate was one of the hardest decisions I ever made - but I now know it was the right thing. ‘To see Evie running around and playing with her older sister, Freya, is just amazing.’ Evie was born with Werner Mesomelic Dysplasia, a condition that meant her tibia bones - the second largest bone in the leg - did not form. Doctors warned that as the she grew, Evie . would have severe difficulties with walking and mobility, leaving Ms . Taylor with two options. ‘I . had spoken to doctors abroad who said it would be possible to use . Evie’s toes to try and grow new tibia bones, and we could also try leg . lengthening procedures,' Ms Taylor said. ‘This method was going to be a very long and painful process - and may not actually work. ‘The other option was to amputate, and ultimately, I felt this option was the only one I could choose.’ After agonising, her mother let doctors amputate her daughter's legs when she was just a year old (left) Evie can now move around like any other child with the help of prosthetics, her mother (right) said . Now with the aid of her prosthetic legs, Evie, now four, can move around like any other four-year-old . After talking to charities such as Steps, Ms Taylor came to conclusion that if Evie did not have an operation or an amputation, she would never be able to walk. Evie . underwent surgery in November 2011, when she was one. Ms Taylor said: . ‘The time leading up to the surgery was very difficult. ‘You are asked to sign a form to confirm that you want them to do the operation, and it was horrible. ‘Evie was so little, just a baby, it was hard to think about what she was going to be put through. ‘I . wondered if she would hate me one day for doing this to her, but I just . had to remember that it was going to change her life for the better. ‘When she came round from the operation, I was so relieved she was okay - it was odd to see her without her legs. ‘But when they took the casts off I was pleased, the stitching was tidy and it looked very neat. I was actually really pleased.’ Within a week, Evie began to walk on her new stumps. ‘Obviously I’d been concerned with how she would adapt, but she was amazing,’ Ms Taylor said. ‘She’s . a feisty little thing and I think she shocked everyone with her . progress. She wasn’t fazed by any of it; she just got on with it.’ Evie was fitted with prosthetic limbs the following February and grasped using them straight away. She has learned to use her prosthetics so adeptly that she can run and bounce on a trampoline . Evie has also now learnt to dance, run, cycle . and even play on a bouncy castle (left), without any help. Her bike . (right) was specially built for her after a fundraising campaign, . because she could not use a traditional bike . ‘Now that Evie is growing up, she knows that she’s different to other people, but she takes it in her stride,’ Ms Taylor said. ‘Sometimes she will ask me if she can grow some legs and toes, but I explain to her gently that it’s not possible. ‘She goes dancing, swimming, she jumps on the trampoline in our garden and she runs around with her big sister. ‘She was walking unaided by the time she was two, she’s very determined.’ Thanks to the support from her local community, Evie now even has a specially made bike that she can cycle around on. Ms Taylor explained: ‘Evie and Freya were playing in the garden and Freya was on a bike . ‘I . put Evie on hers and she couldn’t use it as her prosthetics don’t allow . her legs to bend. It was really sad to watch her as she so desperately . wanted to be able to use it. ‘So I started fundraising for a specially adapted bike that you pedal with your hands. ‘When we finally got it she was so excited, and now she even uses it to cycle to school.’ ‘I’m just so proud of her, she’s gone through so much, and there’s no stopping her.’ Ms Taylor said she was concerned about how Evie would adapt, but that her daughter 'shocked everyone with her progress .","Nicci Taylor, 36, made the decision to amputate Evie’s legs when she was 1 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Spinal injury victims left paralysed have been offered new hope of walking again thanks to a breakthrough in stem cell science. U.S. scientists have regrown spinal cord neurons from a patient’s own cells for the first time. Implanting the cells in rats, they found that the neurons caused the animals’ nervous systems to rewire the spinal cord and brain. Scroll down for video . Spinal injury victims left paralysed (illustrated with a stock image) have been offered new hope of one day walking again, after U.S. scientists re-grew spinal cord neurons from a patient's own cells for the first time . Scientists took skin cells from an 86-year old man. They ‘wound the clock back’ so that the cells became stem cells again and were able to transform into any cell in the body. These stem cells were turned into neurons.They were injected into the spinal cords of paralysed . rats. In three months the neurons had made connections into the rats’ brains and along the length of their spinal cords. The new nerves extended into their limbs too. While this marks a scientific breakthrough, the rats were unable to walk again. The cells used to grow the neurons were taken from a healthy 86-year old man. They were converted into stem cell and then neurons. Researchers grafted the neurons into rats with spinal cord injuries that were two weeks old. They quickly formed tens of thousands of connections into the animal’s brain and along the spinal cord, according to the study published in Neuron. The connections extended out into the limbs of the injured rats’ limbs and bodies – ‘virtually the entire length of the animals’ central nervous system’. Mark Tuszynski, professor of neurosciences at the University of California, San Diego said that three months later the cells grafted ‘across long distances in the rats' spinal cords, even extending to the brain’ by ‘traversing wound tissues to penetrate and connect’. This image depicts extension of human nerve fibres into a rat's brain three months after spinal cord injury. Green fluorescent protein identifies human graft-derived nerve fibres, and red indicates host rat spinal cord white matter. Blue marks host rat grey matter . Lead scientist Dr Paul Lu of the university, said the human neurons ‘extended through the white matter of the injury sites, frequently penetrating adjacent grey matter to form synapses with rat neurons.’ ‘These findings indicate that intrinsic neuronal mechanisms readily overcome the barriers created by a spinal cord injury to extend many axons [nerve fibres] over very long distances, and that these capabilities persist even in neurons reprogrammed from very aged human cells.’ While the animals did not walk again, the experts still said they had made a breakthrough. And they believe that the build-up of scar tissue where the cells were implanted, could have prevented the rats from moving. Professor Tuszynski said: ‘Me and the team are now attempting to identify the most promising neural stem cell type for repairing spinal cord injuries. ‘We are trying to do as much as we possibly can to identify the best way of translating neural stem cell therapies for spinal cord injury to patients.’ For years the experts have been trying to find a way to prove that a spinal cord injury does not have to result in permanent dysfunction and paralysis. Scientists are so keen to use a patient’s own cells because they are more likely to be accepted by a person’s own body preventing them from having to stake strong immunosuppressant drugs for life. For years the expert has been trying to find a way to prove that a spinal cord injury results in permanent dysfunction and paralysis. Currently, there is no way to treat spinal injuries once connections between the neurons (illustrated) are lost, resulting in connections between the brain and the body being cut off . Currently, there is no way to treat spinal injuries once connections between the neurons are lost, resulting in connections between the brain and the body being cut off. Professor Tuszynski said : ‘Earlier work has shown that grafted stem cells reprogrammed to become neurons can, in fact, form new, functional circuits across an injury site, with the treated animals experiencing some restored ability to move affected limbs.’ However, he warned that further tests to find out how best to graft stem cells and cure paralysis could take ‘months to years’. He also said that experts should be cautious when conducting a human trial in the future. ‘The enormous outgrowth of axons [verve fibres] to many regions of the spinal cord and even deeply into the brain raises questions of possible harmful side effects if axons are mistargeted. ‘We need to learn if the new connections formed by axons are stable over time, and if implanted human neural stem cells are maturing on a human time frame – months to years – or more rapidly.’","U.S. scientists have regrown spinal cord neurons from a patient’s own cells .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The stark difference in the health of Northerners and Southerners was laid bare again today after alarming life expectancy figures were revealed. A person living in Glasgow is four times more likely to die early - before the age of 75 - from heart disease than someone living in leafy Hampshire. The statistics, released by the British Heart Foundation (BHF), show an ‘unacceptable’ divide in the heart health of the nation - leading to ‘shocking inequalities’ in the number of deaths from heart and circulatory disease, the charity says. Scroll down for video. Figures from the British Heart Foundation show 'shocking inequalities' in the number of deaths from heart (cardiovascular) disease. Map shows where people are more likely to die prematurely from CVD (marked in deep red for between 95 and 144 people per 100,000) through to areas where people are the least likely to die before the age of 75 from CVD (marked in the lightest shade of red for between 35 and 61 people per 100,000) The charity has released a list of the places with the highest and lowest death rates for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Across the UK, around 100 people under . the age of 75 die from the condition every day. It accounts for more . than one in four of all UK deaths. The statistics reveal that in Glasgow, 144 people out of every 100,000 under the age of 75 prematurely die from CVD, while only 40 out of every 100,000 in Hart, Hampshire, prematurely die because of such problems. Other places listed as having high death rates include Manchester, Blackpool, Dundee and Inverclyde, the charity found. In Manchester, 134 people out of 100,000 die prematurely from CVD, and in Blackpool 125 people in every 100,000 succumb to the disease before the age of 75. On the . other end of the scale, parts of Hampshire, Surrey and Cambridgeshire . have the lowest death rates from heart disease in the under-75s. In all these places, between 35 and 47 people in every 100,000 under the age of 75 prematurely die from the condition. ‘These . figures are a stark reminder of the unacceptable number of people that . lose their lives to cardiovascular disease every year, often increased . by the place they live,’ said BHF chief executive Simon Gillespie. The five areas where people are most likely to die from heart disease before 75. Glasgow leads the way with 144 people out of every 100,000 dying prematurely.

In all these places, between 35 and 47 people in every 100,000 died early . ‘There is still so much more we need to . do. We’ve made huge progress in the fight against cardiovascular . disease, with 70 per cent of heart attack victims now surviving to go . home to their families. ‘With the help of our supporters, we’ll increase investment and accelerate our world-class research that could save the lives of more people that die prematurely. We remain determined to win the fight against cardiovascular disease, improving the lives of the seven million people living with it and saving those that currently die too young.’ In its new strategy, the charity has said the key to preventing more premature deaths is to make sure research advancements go further and faster. It aims to tackle health inequalities by preventing people from developing CVD in the first place, which could help reduce early deaths from the disease by 25 per cent by 2025 – the equivalent to 10,000 lives a year.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . You may have a favourite pillow that seems to help you sleep better. But it could cause acne and trigger allergies if it is more than six months old, one expert claims. This is because dirt, oil, mites and dead skin can build up in older pillows. It's enough to give you nightmares: Pillows that are more than six months old harbour dirt, oil, dead skin cells and dust mites, which could cause acne and even trigger allergic reactions,sleep experts claim . A study released in March suggested that millions of Britons are risking illness because they do not replace their pillows and duvet as often as they should. The poll of nearly 2,200 men and women found that 82 per cent of people do not know how often they should replace their pillows and duvet. According to the Sleep Council, pillows should be replaced every two years and duvets should be thrown away after five years. But, a study by Ergoflex UK showed that the average Briton uses a pillow for 3.2 years and a duvet for 7.6 years. As a result, experts say they are risking neck problems caused by sleeping without enough head and neck support. They are also at risk of health problems associated with dust mite infestations. The survey revealed 57 per cent of people only replace their bedding when it feels like it is wearing thin. Dr Robert Oexman, director of the Sleep to Live Institute in Mebane, North Carolina, told The Huffington Post that people sleeping on old pillows might be pressing their faces against dirt, oil and dead skin cells, which can cause acne. The research centre works with engineers and scientists to develop better products and improve the quality of sleep for people by helping them pick the right mattresses and pillows. Dust mites also set up home in pillows and can exacerbate asthma and trigger allergic reactions, according to Dr Mark Neustrom, an allergist & immunologist at Kansas City Allergy and Asthma Associates. Of the 20 per cent of people who suffer . from allergies, around two thirds may be allergic to dust mites that . live in carpets and bedding. He explained that if dust allergy . sufferer’s reactions are much stronger in the morning and at night, . their pillow may be to blame, because the protein that triggers . reactions to the mites is not airborne. Dr Oexman suggests regularly washing bedding and putting it in a tumble drier as an extra precaution. He . also advises looking for a pillow that fills the gap between your head . and shoulders when you lie down, when it comes to shopping for a new . one. People . who sleep on their stomach or back should pick slimmer pillows, whereas . side sleepers should opt for a plumper pillow to provide necessary . support he claims.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From people chewing with their mouths open to those who crack their knuckles, we all have certain sounds that grate on our nerves. But for one man, the sound of popping gum, cracking ice or the innocent flick of a lighter can trigger the most irrational anger. Paul Tabachneck, 39, has misophonia, which literally means ‘hatred of sound,’ despite being a musician. Scroll down for music . Paul Tabachneck, 39, has Misophonia, which literally means 'hatred of sound,' despite being a musician. He can't bear noises including popping bubblegum and crunching ice cubes and becomes tense and angry . The IT worker, who lives in New York City, cannot bear certain noises and immediately become tense and has violent thoughts upon hearing them. People with misophonia typically have an aversion to quiet everyday noises such as sniffing, clicking and crunching – even breathing – and they react involuntarily. Mr Tabachneck remembers the first time he realised that his reactions to annoying sounds were different from anyone else's. Aged 14, he was watching a film on TV when he heard his father scraping the final dregs of ice cream out of a bowl. He told MailOnline: ‘I spun around and asked - to my Dad's surprise - “Do I need to pause the tape?”’,' adding that was probably his mildest reaction. ‘It’s got worse and worse. I didn’t know how to explain what I was going through and it registered as pain.’ After it . was apparent that he was acting abnormally, his parents took him to an . audiologist who said  his hearing was normal. Instead, his problem . with certain noises was ‘all in the head’. ‘I was upset. It felt like my parents didn’t trust me,’ he said. It was not until 2010 that he was eventually diagnosed him with misophonia. He couldn't afford the experimental treatments available 'in wallet or spirit, but just knowing there was a name for it and that I wasn't some isolated freak case, helped immensely.' To help other people understand Misophonia, Mr Tabachneck has written a song called Two People Made This Mess to express how sounds make him feel. He says that music and the guitar does not annoy him when he, or someone else is playing it, unless the instrument is out of tune . Having lived with the condition for around 25 years – many people first experience problems when they hit puberty – he now knows what the worst sound triggers are and methods to cope with them. ‘Gum popping, [his worst trigger] is huge,’ Mr Tabachneck said. People scraping bowls and chewing with their mouths open are also intolerable - and he can’t bear to be next to them. Mr Tabachneck said: ‘You see red. The pain I feel is part of the feeling when you’re being attacked. It feels like you’re under threat. ‘I used to hate it when people opened and shut Zippo lighters in bars - although that doesn’t happen as many bars have banned smoking – and popcorn is bad.’ ‘I love movies but I have to sit at the back of the cinema away from the popcorn noise – and move if someone sits nearby.’ Gum chewing and people crunching on ice cubes are also big triggers for him. Explaining how gum chewing makes him feel, Mr Tabachneck said: ‘As soon as someone opens a packet of gum, the anxiety ramps up. 'If someone’s chewing with their mouth closed, its fine. But if they chew loudly with their mouth open I don’t know what to do. And if they pop the gum, a conversation starts. ‘I visibly react – my body does a thing that they notice. 'Sometimes people take offence when I ask them to stop, and I tell them about my condition.  But if they don't understand and stop, then they're an ass and I move away.’ He sometimes feels incredibly angry and has come close to violence on one occasion, which prompted him to explore anger management techniques, which are common for people with misophonia to use. Once, for example, a young co-worker deliberately crunched an ice cube in his ear - after  he asked them to stop chewing on it. 'I immediately sprung out of my seat and adopted an aggressive pose – despite being opposed to violence,' he said. ‘That was the closest I’ve been to violence,’ he admitted. ‘I had to think about my anger and how to tone it down’. As well as controlling negative emotions, he has found other methods of coping with misophonia. ‘You learn to live with it - and you can get headphones that block sounds. Maybe you also have a few less friends as some people don’t understand,’ he said. The condition has cost him some relationships, too. ‘Before my fiancé, I was with a woman I loved and I realised I couldn’t be a husband or father without finding a way to get rid of my hang-ups [about sounds she made]’. Misophonia literally means 'hatred of sound' and can be a hypersensitivity to background noise that does not generally bother other people. Different people have different triggers, which prompt a negative emotional response. Triggers include: chewing, sucking, teeth grinding, soft breathing, raspy voices, yawning, clicking on keyboards, writing sounds, plastic wrappers, animal noises, TV and body noises. Sufferers can experience acute annoyance, discomfort or even rage and panic when hearing a noise, while some become agitated, defensive or offensive. Others with the condition stay away from other people and experience relationship difficulties to avoid a 'trigger'. Sometimes the people who are closest to a sufferer are those who make the most unbearable sounds. People with misophonia can feel guilty about their reactions, which can include rage. Source: Misophonia.com . His fiancé, Ana, a social worker, loves bubble gum but doesn’t pop it in Mr Tabachneck’s presence. ‘She’s very conscious of the triggers and goes to great pains to keep the house safe for me. She apologises when she makes a noise that’s a trigger. It takes a very understanding soul to cope,’ he said. To help other people understand Misophonia, Mr Tabachneck has written a song called Misophoina as well as an album Two People Made This Mess to express how sounds make him feel. ‘I wrote it so that it might help my friends understand – and other Misophones and their families understand – and maybe to deal with it in a cathartic way.’ Interestingly, he explained that music and the guitar does not annoy him when he, or someone else is playing it, unless the instrument is out of tune. ‘But there’s a Bill Withers track where he cracks a tambourine very close to the microphone to deliberately ramp up the tension – and it works. I . 'love that song but I have to turn that part down or skip it completely as it gets me into a very angry place,’ he said.","Paul Tabachneck, 39, has misophonia, which literally means 'hatred of sound'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Young people who have read the Harry Potter books are less likely to discriminate against minority groups, a new study claims. Researchers believe that people who recognise the main characters’ battle against evil Lord Voldemort are more likely to tolerate minority groups such as homosexuals and refugees. They are most likely to show empathy towards immigrants and refugees if they strongly identify with the character Harry Potter, who stands up for small groups of people and creatures throughout the story. Scientists believe that people who identify with Harry Potter's battle against evil Lord Voldemort (pictured right) are more likely to tolerate minority groups such as homosexuals, immigrants and refugees and in real life . A political science professor claimed that Harry Potter is partly responsible for Barack Obama being elected as U.S. President. Last year Professor Anthony Gierzynski said that the moral tales found in the best-selling books 'played a small but not insignificant role' in influencing voters in both elections in 2009 and 2012. He argued that fans took on-board key themes in the novels, including lessons of tolerance and diversity, which made President Obama and the Democratic Party appeal to them more than the Republican Party. Professor Gierzynski, at the University of Vermont, said that millennials, who are born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s and comprise the core of J.K. Rowling's fan base, were so taken with the novels' moralistic themes it influenced their political persuasion. Researchers from three Italian universities and the University of Greenwich in London, surveyed 34 Italian school children in year five of primary school to look at their attitudes towards immigrants, Medical Daily reported. They then read them sections of the Harry Potter books over six weeks that focus on the parts to do with prejudice, such as the Death Eaters’ negative attitude to ‘muggles’ such as Hermione who they do not consider pure blood wizards. Much of the series of novels centres around the young wizards’ quests to stand up for minority groups, whether they are house elves kept as servants or persecuted ‘mud-blood’ wizards. They found that following the readings, the children showed more empathy towards immigrants and those who were most sympathetic, strongly identified with the protagonist, Harry Potter. Their study says that the younger . children responded to Harry Potter’s positive attitudes towards . ‘stigmatised fantastic groups,’ leading the experts to conclude that the . children improved their attitudes to gay people and immigrants. Based on a survey of Italian school children, the reserachers found that people are most likely to show empathy towards immigrants and refugees (pictured) if they strongly identify with the character Harry Potter, who stands up for small groups of people and creatures throughout the story . In a second survey, the social scientists found that two groups of college students in the UK and Italy also altered their attitudes towards political refugees having read excerpts of the books. They wrote in the study, published in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology: ‘Harry Potter book reading was positively associated with perspective toward refugees only among those less identified with Voldemort. Perspective taking, in turn, was associated with improved attitudes toward refugees.’ The scientists believe that ‘reading the novels can potentially tackle actual prejudice reduction,’ even though the books’ author, J.K. Rowling insisted that she did not write them with that specific intention in mind. In 2003, she told journalist Lizo Mzimba: ‘I’ve never set out to teach anyone anything,’ but later admitted that she wanted Harry Potter to experience similar problems in the wizarding world than those in our own. Like other literary critics, the scientists found parallels between the evil character Voldemort and Hitler. ‘The Potter books in general are a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry,’ J.K. Rowling is quoted as saying in the book Harry Potter’s Bookshelf, by John Granger. The scientists believe that 'reading the novels can potentially tackle actual prejudice reduction,' even though the books' author, J K Rowling insisted that she did not write them with that specific intention in mind.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Despite now being located on the opposite sides of the globe, southern Australia and the North West United States used to be neighbours. That's what a study of Tasmania's oldest rocks has revealed. Minerals present in rocks in the island state's north, dating from an ocean more than 1.3 billion years ago, contain traces of other minerals - monazite and zircon. Minerals present in rocks in the island . state's north, and dating from an ocean more than 1.3 billion years ago, . contain traces of minerals monazite (pictured left) and zircon (right). Experts believe the samples prove that Tasmania and the U.S. were once neighbours . The minerals were extracted from sedimentary rocks from the Rocky Cape Group in North West Tasmania, where they were once deposited in an ancient ocean between 1.45 and 1.33 billion years ago – making them the oldest rocks in Tasmania. Researchers from the University of Tasmania and Mineral Resources Tasmania dated the minerals and found a pattern common to sedimentary rocks from the U.S. states of Montana and Idaho, as well as parts of Canadian province British Columbia. According to the study, published in the journal Precambrian Research, the result was ‘a strong genetic fingerprint and evidence’ that Tasmania's Rocky Cape was geographically close about 1.4 billion years ago to a basin that stretches through parts of Canada and the U.S. The minerals were extracted from sedimentary rocks from the Rocky Cape Group (pictured) in north west Tasmania, where they were once deposited in an ancient ocean between 1.45 and 1.33 billion years ago - making them the oldest rocks in Tasmania . Lead researcher Jacqueline Halpin explained: ‘At this time, both Tasmania and North America were part of a supercontinent called Nuna. ‘As plate tectonics and the supercontinent cycle started to rift Nuna apart, a large sedimentary basin formed that included the Rocky Cape Group and Belt-Purcell Supergroup rocks.’ The continued breakup of Nuna eventually dispersed parts of this ancient sedimentary basin to opposite sides of the Earth. Dr Peter McGoldrick, also at the university, said that the new mineral dates also provide an age constraint for the Horodyskia fossils that were recently discovered in the Rocky Cape Group. These ‘string of beads’ fossils have also previously been found in the Belt-Purcell rocks. Fossils visible to the naked eye are exceedingly rare from rocks older than 635 million years. Horodyskia from the Rocky Cape Group and the Belt-Purcell Basin are nearly twice this age,’ he said. How South America could have ruled the world: This image shows how the Earth MIGHT have looked if Africa had been split in two. The move would have left a huge ocean south of today's Sahara desert, creating a South Atlantic and a Saharan Atlantic Ocean . Researchers have revealed a fascinating glimpse of how the world could have looked - if a shift in the Earth's tectonic plates had taken a slightly different turn. Australian researchers said in March that the break-up of the supercontinent Gondwana about 130 Million years ago could have lead to a completely different shape of the African and South American continent. They explained that the move would have left a huge ocean south of today’s Sahara desert, creating a South Atlantic and a Saharan Atlantic Ocean. Geoscientists from the University of Sydney and the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences used sophisticated plate tectonic and three-dimensional numerical modelling to recreate the shift - but with a different twist. The researchers said that the shift that left Africa it its present location was almost very different. 'Extension along the South Atlantic and West African rift systems was about to split the African-South American part of Gondwana North-South into nearly equal halves, generating a South Atlantic and a Saharan Atlantic Ocean', geoscientist Sascha Brune said. 'In a dramatic plate tectonic twist, however, a competing rift along the present-day Equatorial Atlantic margins, won over the West African rift, causing it to become extinct, avoiding the break-up of the African continent and the formation of a Saharan Atlantic ocean.' The team believe that their study highlights the importance of rift orientation relative to extension direction as key factor deciding whether an ocean basin opens or an aborted rift basin forms in the continental interior. For hundreds of millions of years, the southern continents of South America, Africa, Antarctica, Australia, and India were united in the supercontinent Gondwana. While the causes for Gondwana's fragmentation are still debated, it is clear that the supercontinent first split along the East African coast in a western and eastern part before separation of South America from Africa took place.","Rocks in Tasmania's north contain traces of minerals monazite and zircon .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A computer programme has been created that write its own moralistic tales, like Aesop's famous Hare and the Tortoise (illustrated) Many people will be familiar with Aesop’s fables such as The Hare and the Tortoise, but now there’s a computer programme that uses artificial intelligence to write its own moralistic tales. The Moral Storytelling System can create fables around particular combinations of emotions or desires felt by the characters in a story. There are 22 emotions to choose from in all. It is the next step closer to enabling machines to make meaningful literary works in their own right. Explaining how the technology works, Margaret Sarlej, a PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: ‘a human author simply decides an interesting emotional path for the story, and the computer does the rest.’ ‘The computer decides the events to elicit those emotional responses from the characters and the characters do whatever the plot needs them to do.’ A psychological model known as OCC, named after its creators Ortony, Clore and Collins, determines the emotions and Ms Sarlej's computer programme is based on the OCC model. The result is a kind of high-tech version of the famed Ancient Greek storyteller Aesop, although at the moment, the machine is not quite as eloquent. The researchers hope that their computer programme will advance computers’ abilities to author stories with ever-growing sophistication and complexity. Ms Sarlej's supervisor, Dr Malcolm Ryan, predicts that computers ‘will be making interesting and meaningful contributions to literature within the next decade’. Once upon a time there lived a unicorn, a knight and a fairy. The unicorn loved the knight. One . summer's morning the fairy stole the sword from the knight. As a . result, the knight didn't have the sword anymore. The knight felt . distress that he didn't have the sword anymore. The . knight felt anger towards the fairy about stealing the sword because he . didn't have the sword anymore. The unicorn and the knight started to . hate the fairy. The next . day the unicorn kidnapped the fairy. As a result, the fairy was not . free. The fairy felt distress that she was not free. No humans required? The researchers hope that their computer programme will advance computers' abilities to author complex stories - without human writers (pictured). Dr Malcolm Ryan, predicts that computers 'will be making interesting and meaningful contributions to literature within the next decade' ‘They might be more experimental than mainstream, but the computer will definitely be doing some of the work of writing.’ The researchers hope that authors, computer game designers and other creators will see value in the research. ‘For us, this is a serious literary project and we want to find artists who can help direct it to that end,’ Dr Ryan said. He believes that one of the benefits of collaboration is the potential to uncover new and exciting possibilities. ‘How will this technology be used? It is impossible to predict. We hope artists will take it up and create things we'd never imagined.’","Scientists from the university of New South Wales in Australia created the programme that can write its own moralistic tales .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A delivery driver is lucky to be alive after his leg was almost ‘eaten alive’ by a rare bacterial infection. Colin Sines, 46, was infected with necrotising fasciitis, which quickly attacked his right leg. After feeling a sharp pain while on a shift, the TNT driver realised his leg was swelling up. Colin Sines, (pictured left) 46, was infected with a disease called necrotising fasciitis, which quickly attacked his right leg. In order to attack the aggressive disease (pictured right), surgeons had to strip disease flesh from Mr Sines' leg below the knee in an emergency operation . When his leg ballooned to twice its normal size within just 30 minutes, he was forced to cut away his boot. Mr Sines told Get Surrey: ‘It was as if someone had stuck a red-hot poker into me.’ Despite being in excruciating pain, he managed to drive home to Ash, Surrey, where his partner Michelle Payne called an ambulance, The Mirror reported. In order to attack the aggressive infection, surgeons had to strip diseased flesh from Mr Sines’ leg below the knee in an emergency operation. He then slipped into a coma for 12 days, during which time he hallucinated and had nightmares, which still haunt him. Necrotising fasciitis (micrograph pictured) is a rare bacterial infection that affects soft tissue and the tissue binding muscles and organs. It can occur following a cut or surgery when bacteria can enter through weakened skin like a blister . Necrotising fasciitis is a rare bacterial infection that affects soft tissue and the tissue binding muscles and organs. It can occur following a cut or surgery when bacteria can enter through weakened skin like a blister. The earliest sign of the bug is people being in severe pain, which seems out of proportion to any external signs of the infection. As it progresses, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting can occur before the person falls unconscious. The skin typically turns a dark violet colour, blister form and the tissue underneath begins to die. Without treatment to remove the affected tissue, the bug will spread rapidly and can result on death. Source: Health Protection Agency . Mr Sines said: ‘My leg was being eaten alive. I was in toxic shock - my kidneys and liver were shutting down - I was dying.’ Experts are unsure how the lorry driver caught the bug, but think that his ‘diabolically weak’ immune system is to blame. He is now having physiotherapy to help him walk again, as the lifesaving operation he underwent has left him unable to move without the aid of a frame or walking sticks. Because of his inability to move around easily, Mr Sines gained weight rapidly, which worsened his Type 2 diabetes that he has lived with for more than 15 years. He reached 30 stone (191kg) in May 2013 and his blood sugar levels became dangerously high. He turned to diabetes.co.uk’s online forum for help, where others with diabetes encouraged him to take control of his life. Mr Sines has now lost 12 stone, which has improved his diabetes. However, he has been told his prospects of walking normally again are not good. However he is determined to return to work and has vowed to keep trying.","Colin Sines, 46, was infected with a disease called necrotising fasciitis .

"By . Bianca London . Aside from winning fashion designer of the year and making millions with the Spice Girls, appearing on the cover of UK Vogue for the third time has to be one of Victoria Beckham's greatest career coups. Always known for her immaculately glossy appearance, you'd think the fashion designer would pull out all the stops to ensure she looked picture perfect for her starring role. However, the 40-year-old, who never has so much as a hair out of place, shocked the world when she appeared on the fashion bible wearing a baggy jumper, Wellington boots, and a messy up-do. Scroll down for video . Could YOU look this good in just one minute? Victoria Beckham's beauty team have revealed that it only took a minute to style the designer's hair into its laidback luxe style for her Vogue cover . Stylist Tina Outen, who worked her magic on Victoria's hair for the cover and describes her as 'awesome fun', said the style was a spontaneous decision. 'It probably took less than a minute, it . was just a matter of putting it up, pinning it and playing around with . it to make it look right for her face. 'Victoria knows her face very well . so she knows what suits her, but she's very respectful and trusting. She lets you do your job,' she told Vogue.co.uk. 'The hair for the other cover was . literally created by her getting dressed, getting her hair caught in the . coat and us pulling pieces out and giving it a bit of a finish. That's . how we approached the hair for all of the shots - we just got the . texture right, all looked at it in the mirror and then we just let it . evolve,' she added. Tina explained that Victoria likes to be able to touch her hair and to play with it, hence the laidback luxe look she embraces on the cover, which we will all be copying next season. Opening up about the shoot in a behind the scenes video, Victoria said: ‘I’m never afraid to try something different when I’m working with the best people.’ The . mother-of-four continued: ‘Doing a Vogue shoot is always very exciting – . it’s Vogue and the team, the creative team, the photographer, the hair, . the make-up, the styling, everything is the best.’ The video also features Vogue’s fashion director Lucinda Chalmers who reveals her thought process behind the shoot. Speaking as they shot in Surrey on a rainy day, she said: ‘We want to try do something we haven’t really seen her do before. As we're used to seeing her: The Vogue team said they wanted to try something different on the usually polished Victoria, who was perfectly happy to adhere . ‘She has a very particular look, very . cool, very paired down and what I really wanted to do with her was . really rough her up a bit.’ In between shooting the designer, who is married to David Beckham, revealed a little about her fashion memories. ‘I always loved clothes as a child. I used to really enjoy watching my mother get dressed up,’ she shared. ‘My earliest childhood memory is sitting . on her bed watching her and her attention to detail, putting her . make-up on and doing her hair, she always looked fabulous.’ Quite the difference! Victoria Beckham's first Vogue cover in February 2011 is a far cry from the country chic lady on the August cover . Picking up some tips? Following her Vogue shoot, Victoria was seen at Wimbledon sporting a more messy hairstyle . And talking about how she uses clothes . these days she said: ‘I use clothes to express how I’m feeling myself . and when designing clothes I like to empower women, I want to make them . feel strong and beautiful and confident.’ As the video comes to an end the British . star concludes: ‘What’s next for me? I have my next store opening . hopefully in September in Dover Street in London and I’m opening an . office in New York so I’ve been very, very busy at work, juggling the . work and the kids and David but it’s all good, I feel very blessed, very . lucky and I am having fun.’ See the full film at Vogue.co.uk now and the full shoot in the August issue of Vogue, on sale now.","Victoria, 40, features on cover of Vogue's August issue .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . She may be the toast of the fashion world but according to public opinion even Victoria Beckham is guilty of making fashion faux pas. A new survey, which polled 1,000 Brits about age appropriate fashion and behaviour, found that very steep high heels loved by celebrities such as Mrs Beckham, should not be worn by anyone over the age of 32. At 40, Victoria is well over the cut off. And have you been worried you are too old for a tattoo? According to the survey, which polled 500 men and 500 women between the ages of 18 and 70, if you've turned 31, your chance is over. Someone better tell 68-year-old Helen Mirren, who brandishes an inking on her hand. So if you don’t want to end up branded on social media as #WhitneydressedasBritney or secretly snapped and posted under #menwithponytails, read on. Scroll down for video . Left: Victoria Beckham in age-inappropriate towering heels. Right: Courtney Cox, who recently turned 50, gets it oh-so wrong by wearing a cap 18 years over the survey's cut off . The worst offences include: wearing a baseball cap if you are older than 32, men growing a goatee beard if they are older than 32 and women older than 48 wearing a bikini. Lots of people like to recapture . their youth in middle-age but if you don’t want to make your children . cringe, maybe it is worth sticking to the most popular age limits in the . survey by diet company Forza Supplements. Having . a tattoo is a great sign of teenage rebellion - and even the Prime . Minister’s wife Samantha Cameron has a small dolphin on her ankle. But most of us reckon that it is embarrassing to show off a new etching after the age of 31. And it's not just in the wardrobe department where you have to tread carefully. Routinely ending emails or texts with a kiss (X) to strangers is also deemed embarrassing after the age of 29. Emails and texting are another minefield of age-related etiquette. Brad PItt is a very dishy 'embarrassment' sporting a goatee when he's over a decade above the cut off; Right: Helen Mirren's tattoo is also deemed inappropriate by the survey . Prime Minister David Cameron famously wrongly used the text short-form 'LOL' - thinking it meant Lots of Love and not the correct Laugh Out Loud. But is it any wonder? After all, At 47, Cameron is 18 years too old for this kind of texting - which should stop at 29 according to the survey. Similarly, however happy, sad, surprised or amazed you're feeling, no one should use emoticons in their texts over the age of 26. Another politician to get it wrong was Foreign Secretary William Hague, who was ridiculed for wearing a baseball cap when he was aged 36. He was four years over the cut off point, which the survey pinpointed at 32. Courtney Cox, is also a big fan of the headgear, even though she's wildly over the age limit having just turned 50. Wearing a baseball cap back-to-front is even more age prohibitive with a cut off of 25. Listening to Radio 1 is an essential part of most children’s upbringing - but any adult doing it beyond the age of 29 should think about switching to Radio 2. Millions of women will be wearing a bikini on the beach this summer - but according to the survey women over the age of 48 should only sport all-in-ones. If you're Jerry Hall, however, you might just about get away with it, despite missing the cut off by a decade. Crop tops, meanwhile, have an age restriction of 28 and below. There are lots of ways that men try to turn back the clock. Growing a goatee, as 50-year-old Brad Pitt often does, is not advised after the age of 34. David Beckham has regularly worn his hair in a ponytail, but the survey found men shouldn’t have one after the age of 29. Luckily though, Becks has one more year to attend music festivals without becoming an embarrassment. The cut off point for going to festivals like Glastonbury is the oldest in the survey at  41, reflecting the increasing numbers of middle-aged revelers who attend. The survey has other suggestions about  what's age appropriate in our free time. Snowboarding is fun when you are young but you should switch to skiing at 36 if you don’t want to be naff. Anyone enjoying reality TV like The Only Way is Essex or Towie beyond the age of 31 is also deemed an embarrassment. And when it comes to reality TV voting on programmes like The X-Factor the cut off is a mere 26-years-old. The youngest cut off point revealed in the survey is for kissing in the street, which should be avoided beyond 25. Other behaviour to be given an age warning included riding a skateboard (cut off point 26) and wearing a replica football shirt (37). Forza Supplements managing director Lee Smith said: 'We are all trying to slow down the ageing process, and it is fun to recapture our youth by revisiting the hobbies and fashions of our teens. 'A cut off point of 48 for wearing bikinis does seem very harsh. Women in their 50s and 60s who have stayed in shape can look fantastic in the right bikini.' Forza sees a 30 per cent surge in sales between May and July as million of women get ready for the beach.

The venue will be home to Miami Beckham United and house 20,000 fans after their original plan for a facility at nearby PortMiami was ruled out by Dade County officials following resistance from local businesses. The plan centres around a £12million project to fill in a deep-water boat slip next to the home of NBA side the Miami Heat.

"By . Chris Hastings . Doctor Who's assistant Clara Oswald is in for a rude awakening when she’s teamed up with new Time Lord Peter Capaldi. In the last series she had the Doctor – as played by Matt Smith – under her thumb. But that’s all set to change now that The Thick Of It’s Capaldi has taken over as the Doctor. Scroll down for video . Off kilter: Jenna Coleman with new Doctor Peter Capaldi . Steven Moffat, writer and producer of the BBC1 series, says the new Doctor will ‘bare his fangs’ as Clara’s world is turned upside town with the arrival of an older and ‘ruder’ Time Lord to replace his lovestruck predecessor. ‘The most interesting thing is what the change of Doctor does to Clara,’ he says. ‘Matt Smith’s Doctor was “Look at me, I am cool because look at who I get to hang out with”. He was like a puppy waiting to roll over and have his stomach tickled. ‘Clara was the control freak who had the controllable Doctor. It was a stable relationship and they were a lovely couple. But now the Doctor grows his fangs back and she thinks, bloody hell, that is hard.’ Moffat says the pair would become friends in time but the new version of the Doctor was not an easy man to pin down. Sudden change: Coleman said her character, Clara Oswald, is faced with an unprecedented challenge by the new Doctor - who will insist he is not her 'boyfriend' ‘He is more uncontrollable, way less predictable.’ Capaldi’s Doctor – who makes his debut in a feature-length episode set in Victorian London shown on BBC1 on Saturday, August 23 – wastes no time in trying to put Oswald, played by Jenna Coleman, in her place. He struggles to remember who she is after his regeneration and asks if she is the one who asks a lot of questions. He refers to her as a control freak and puts her life in danger. His distinctively Scottish Time Lord also leaves her in no doubt that, contrary to what they may have thought in the past, he is not her ‘boyfriend’. Capaldi, 56, is best known for his foul-mouthed spin doctor Malcolm Tucker in the political sitcom The Thick Of It. Coleman, 28, said: ‘Peter’s casting has thrown everything off kilter, especially for Clara. Suddenly she is faced with this man that she can’t figure out or control.’","Who assistant Clara Oswald will be in for a shock with new Doctor .

"By . Richard Spillett . A 74-year-old marathon runner believes a technical error is behind his apparently miraculous performance in the second half of the London Marathon. Veteran runner Frank Staples set off on the grueling 26-mile race shortly after 10am on Sunday, April 13, official race statistics show. He managed to reach the halfway point in a time of around three and a half hours, crossing the midway line at 1:28pm. Frank Staples appears to have completed the second half of the London marathon in under half the time he took to complete the first half . Official photos show Mr Staples crossing Tower Bridge (right) and making his way up the Mall in front of Buckingham Palace (left) Race records show Mr Staples set off at 10am, reached the half way point at 1.30pm but had finished by 2.45pm . But, according to race records, Mr Staples then ran an incredible second half of the race, completing the last 13 miles in just one hour and 14 minutes. The time would not be out of place in an Olympic marathon, with former British women's champion Paula Radcliffe only seven minutes faster in her 2003 World Record run. Mr Staples has denied he had cheated and insisted the extremely fast second half time must be down to a technical problem. He told The Sun: 'I don't remember there being mats to record times. I can't explain it, but it's not my fault.' Mr Staples (centre left) crossed the finish line with a time of four hours, 39 minutes - but his second half performance would have been good enough to keep up with Paula Radcliffe . His overall time of four hours, 39 minutes made him the 15,281st runner to cross the finishing line near Buckingham Palace, the official website states. Retired insurance broker Mr Staples, of Great Somerford, Wiltshire, has run more than 30 marathons including New York, Boston, Sydney and Hawaii since taking up running in the 1980s. A member of London's Serpentine running club, he has even taken part in runs in the Arctic, Antarctic and on Mount Everest. Jason Scotland-Williams was accused of cheating after, like Mr Staples, his record only showed estimated times for 25km, 30km and 35km . It comes after another runner, Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, was accused of duping race officials after he completed the second leg of the marathon in just one hour, one minute - three minutes shy of the world record. It was alleged Mr Scotland-Williams jumped the barrier separating the 13-mile marker from the 22-mile point and hid in the crowds while runners looped round Canary Wharf and doubled back. Like the online record for Mr Scotland-Williams' run, Mr Staples' record only gives estimated times at the 25km, 30km and 35km markers – suggesting he either missed out those checkpoints or that his chip failed to activate at those points. A spokesman for Virgin London Marathon has said they are investigating 'a number of discrepancies' in runners' times.","OAP Frank Staples ran the first 13 miles in around three and a half hours .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . He's played for club and country, scored wonder goals and become one of the world's most famous footballers. But despite rising to sporting stardom, David Beckham has revealed that he once wasn't even the best player at his school. He said: 'I used to practise football on the field. We had a few good young players in the school so I don't think I was . the best player in the class. For some reason I always remember being . picked last in the school games at break time.' The father-of-four recently returned to Chase Lane Primary School, in East London, in his role as an ambassador for Sainsbury's Active Kids scheme. Scroll down for video . Back to school: David Beckham surprises pupils at an assembly at his former primary, Chase Lane . His former school is one of the many across the country who have benefitted from collecting the supermarket vouchers to exchange for sporting equipment. The excited pupils screamed in delight as he surprised them by joining their morning assembly and lunch break. The former Manchester United player revealed the school set him up well for his time at the prestigious club. He said: 'We had one teacher called Mr Magee who . really scared me but it was lucky as he prepared me for Sir Alex . Ferguson who was also scary!' School dinners have improved! The footballer joined pupils for lunch . It's been 30 years since David last walked through the school gates and he explains in the video below how it bought back fond memories. He said: 'I remember being happy when I came to . school. I never missed a day unless I was sick. I was never one of the . top pupils but I always worked hard. 'It's gone very quickly but it's great to be back. A lot has changed here. School dinners are a lot healthier than they were back in the day.' He added after his tour of the grounds: 'All the memories of my favourite classes . and kicking about in the playground have come flooding back. I'm proud . to see Chase Lane is so involved in Active Kids and encourage other . schools and clubs to take advantage of it. 'It's great to talk to the teachers and . children about the importance of leading a healthier lifestyle no matter . what age you are.' It seems football prowess continues at the school as the U11 team will play at Wembley on 25 May in the Year Six National Final. David wished them the best of luck and advised them to savour the moment of playing in the historic ground. Talent blossomed: He became an England star but the footballer admitted he once wasn't even the best in his class at primary school . Keep fit: David is an ambassador for Sainsbury's Active Kids scheme and he's glad his former primary school have been among the many to benefit from it . 'I'm jealous, I'll never play there again,' he admitted. The star was in good humour as the children asked him questions and clamored to shake his hand. One cheeky little boy asked if he had played alongside Sir Bobby Charlton while at Manchester United. 'No, that was quite a few years before I started playing! He was actually my Dad's favourite player,' he diplomatically replied. The visit had an uplifting effect on the children who said meeting the star had inspired them to do well in school. 'We can believe that we can make our dreams come true like he did,' one pupil said.","Footballer is an ambassador for Sainsbury's Active kids .

The former Manchester United manager is held in high esteem by Beckham and, according to The Sunday Times, will try to persuade the 51-year-old to join him in the US.

"By . Tara Brady . This zoo primate looks like he is deep in thought after striking a pose just like Bruce Forsyth in his glory days on The Generation Game.

Aping: The mandrill (right) bends over with its head on its hand - similar to Bruce Forsyth on television (left) He said: 'He was sat in that position for quite some time. 'He looks like he was posing but he was actually scratching his different parts of his head. 'It was a piece of luck to get the photo. I waited for him to scratch his upper nose between his two eyes that look like he is thinking. Maybe he was thinking about escaping. The versatile animal has also prompted comparisons with a classic sculpture after his resemblance to The Thinker by French artist August Rodin was noticed. The Thinker was originally part of the compositional piece Rodin created for the proposed Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. Time out: Jason Mendoza took the photo of the thinking ape at Singapore Zoo . Classic artwork: The pensive primate also resembles The Thinker, a famous statue by Auguste Rodin . The piece, known as The Gates of Hell, is based on the 16th century epic poem, The Divine Comedy by Dante. Many of Rodin's most famous works came out of this piece and The Thinker was originally intended to sit at the top of the door way and represent Dante, as he composed the poem. For this reason The Thinker was originally known as The Poet but as this piece began to gain precedence over The Gates of Hell, it became known as The Thinker and is today a commonly recognised symbol of philosophy and learning.","Jason Mendoza took the photo of the posing ape at Singapore Zoo .

"By . Tania Steere . More than 300 patients a year are dying due to faulty NHS equipment, according to a damning new report. Nearly 5,000 people were left seriously injured last year after using faulty equipment including pacemakers, MRI and CT scanners, according to a report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. In the highest annual total of deaths since records began, 309 patients died last year in ‘adverse incidents’ linked to medical devices. More than 13,000 reports of problems with NHS equipment have accounted for 300 deaths, 5,000 serious injuries and have led to operations being delayed, a report has revealed. File photo . In total, there were 13,642 incidents relating to faulty equipment reported to health officials last year. Medics have also been forced to delay life-saving operations because their machines and tools don’t work. There are concerns a lack of engineers to maintain equipment might be exacerbating the problem. Patients also suffered delays and injuries after issues with incubators, wheelchairs, artificial limbs, syringes and specialist beds. In the report, the engineers say boosting the number of engineers in hospitals would help cut the number of deaths and injuries. It warns that while technology is leading to huge advances in healthcare, it remains dependent on the work of biomedical engineers to fix and maintain it. The catalogue of faults includes problems with pacemakers, CT scanners and MRI machines. File photo . Their report calls for the introduction of a chief biomedical engineer at each NHS trust. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said: ‘Government and the NHS need to take urgent action to prioritise the role engineers play in hospitals and trusts. ‘Technology is leading to huge advances in healthcare, but this technology is dependent on the work of biomedical engineers who are inadequately recognised and in short supply in most hospitals.’ He added: ‘Clinicians and engineers need to work in partnership to ensure that advances in medical technology are applied in the best interest of patients. The benefits of hospitals having a designated chief biomedical engineer responsible for healthcare technology are clear.’","Failures by hospital machines and equipment claimed 309 lives last year .

"By . Tara Brady . Church documents dating back to the 1700s have been discovered by two historians and reveal scandalous details about the private lives of early American settlers. The confessions have been kept for centuries in Congregational churches from the colonial-era across Massachusetts. However, they have now seen the light of day again thanks to two historians James Fenimore Cooper Jr, who is a professor at Oklahoma State University, and Margaret Bendroth, executive director of the Congregational Library in Boston. Historic: Documents were found buried in a church in Middleborough, Massachusetts . Documents included an application from a slave called Cuffee to join the congregation of a church in Middleborough in 1773. At the same congregation, John Briggs admitted he been 'left to fall into the sin of fornication, by which it appears to me, I have not only wounded my own soul but great dishonoured God.' Priscilla Cushman confessed in 1763 that she too had fallen to the 'sin of fornication, to the great dishonour of God', while Jedidiah Lyon admitted in 1786 that he 'was unwarily overcome with strong liquor, in the view of several persons present, by which conduct I have greatly dishonoured God'. The records are now being stored at the Congregational Library in Boston, Massachusetts. Confession: John Briggs admitted he been 'left to fall into the sin of fornication' The confession from Priscilla Cushman in 1763 admits that she had committed 'the sin of fornication' Drunk: Jedidiah Lyon admitted in 1786 that he 'was unwarily overcome with strong liquor' The town of Middleborough was incorporated in 1669 and settled by a group of men from Plymouth. The . first meetinghouse was built in 1680 and the First Church of Christ . (also called the Church at the Green) was officially organised in 1694. Benjamin Franklin is among those who preached at the Middleborough church . Among . those who preached there were Judge Peter Oliver, the last Chief . Justice under the British King, Benjamin Franklin and statesman Sir . William Temple. Dr . Cooper told the New York Times: 'There is no other discrete set of . sources that will similarly transport us into colonial America.' European nations came to the Americas to increase their wealth and broaden their influence over world affairs. The Spanish were among the first Europeans to explore the New World and the first to settle in what is now the United States. By 1650, however, England had established a dominant presence on the Atlantic coast. The first colony was founded at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. Many of the people who settled in the New World came to escape religious persecution. The Pilgrims, founders of Plymouth, Massachusetts, arrived in 1620. In both Virginia and Massachusetts, the colonists flourished with some assistance from Native Americans. New World grains such as corn kept the colonists from starving while, in Virginia, tobacco provided a valuable cash crop. By the early 1700s enslaved Africans made up a growing percentage of the colonial population. By 1770, more than two million people lived and worked in Great Britain's 13 North American colonies.","Documents found by James Fenimore Cooper Jr and Margaret Bendroth .

Sighting: A barrel jellyfish spotted near St Mawes in Cornwall last month . Record numbers of jellyfish are swimming in British waters, a report by marine biologists claimed today. Scientists found record numbers of the creature last year, and they believe 2014 is an equally good year for jellyfish sightings. Last year there were 1,133 sightings of jellyfish, and the researchers said that they have been spotted more than 500 times already this year. The report, from the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), details more than 5,000 reports of jellyfish sightings of eight different species sent to MCS by the British public between 2003 and 2011. It discovered ‘hotspots’ for barrel jellyfish in Welsh and Scottish waters. However, there has been a ‘remarkable’ number of barrel jellyfish spotted of the South West already this year. Prof Brendan Godley, of the University of Exeter, said: ‘By taking stock of our jellyfish in this way, we provide an important baseline of information which will help us understand how jellyfish species react to environmental changes that influence our coastal seas, including climate change. ‘The remarkable number of barrel jellyfish reported from south-west England this year is quite unusual, and at odds with what our report describes, previous years have seen hotspots for this species in west Welsh and Scottish waters. ‘We’re not sure why, but the very mild winter probably meant more adults survived at depth, which will have returned to the surface in spring as waters warmed up. This year’s strange barrel jellyfish results highlight the importance of running the survey year in and year out to track these unusual events and discover if they turn into trends’. The report, entitled the MCS National Jellyfish Survey, was published in the Journal of the Marine Biological Association.","Percheron horses had much-needed cooling splash in stream after working on farm near Ringwood, Hampshire .

But last night news agency AFP reported that a local vigilante, Abbas Gava, said he had ‘received an alert from my colleagues . . . that about 63 of the abducted women and girls had made it back home’. The escape was confirmed by a security source in Maiduguri, the regional capital, on the condition of anonymity, AFP reported.

Members have killed thousands in bomb and . gun attacks in a five-year insurgency, striking as far afield as the . central city of Jos and the capital Abuja. Terror: The girls were paraded in a video which sparked a global campaign, but the government's response was muted, said critics. With three months having passed since the abduction, hopes are fading . Weeks after the kidnapping the group’s leader Abubakar Shekau released a video in which he said he would sell the girls into slavery or marry them off if members of his sect were not released from prison. The government has come under fire for its confused response as President Goodluck Jonathan ruled out releasing prisoners, but ministers said it would be possible to negotiate. The abduction triggered a worldwide campaign, Bring Back Our Girls, with celebrities taking part including the U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama. Amnesty International estimates about 1,500 people have been killed in northeast Nigeria in the first three months of this year. Just two weeks ago there were unconfirmed reports from Nigerian media of another kidnapping of more than 90 villagers in the same area.","Nearly 300 were taken by terrorists from village of Chibok on April 14 .

Columbian Isabella Acevedo was detained by Border Force officials yesterday afternoon at Haringey town hall in north London just moments before the ceremony was about to start, according to witnesses. Isabella Acevedo worked for former immigration minister Mark Harper who resigned after learning she didn't have leave to remain in the UK . Miss Acevedo, 47, had worked as Tory immigration minister Mark Harper’s cleaner for seven years until February, when he discovered she did not have leave to remain in the UK. Mr Harper was responsible for the controversial van adverts telling immigrants to ‘go home’ and was also overseeing a bill that requires employers to check the status of their staff. He . resigned in February but was reappointed to the government in this . week’s reshuffle as a junior minister at the Department for Work and . Pensions.

"By . Tania Steere . The only Victoria Cross medal awarded for the British campaign in Tibet 110 years ago became the most expensive sold at auction yesterday when it was sold for £408,000. The medal was bought by billionaire Lord Ashcroft, who holds the world’s biggest collection of Victoria Cross medals estimated to be worth £40 million. The Victoria Cross awarded to Lieutenant John Duncan Grant, will join the other 183 medals in Lord Ashcroft’s collection on display at the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum. Historic: The Victoria Cross medal (left top) was sold for £408,000 at auction. It was awarded to John Grant in 1905 for his bravery during the British campaign in Tibet . The medal went for the hammer price of £340,000 but with a 20 per cent fee from the auctioneers Morton and Eden the final price comes to £408,000. This smashes the previous record of a hammer price in the British Isles of £290,000 for a Victoria Cross. This is the first time this medal has been available to purchase as it has remained in the Grant family. The Victoria Cross is the highest military decoration awarded for valour ‘in the face of the enemy’ and was introduced on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to honour bravery during the Crimean War. The medal has been awarded 1,357 times to 1,354 individual recipients, but there was only one awarded during the campaign to Tibet. Lieutenant John Duncan Grant led a force sent to Tibet to negotiate with the Dalai Lama to prevent Russian encroachment into India through Tibet. However, in order to reach the sacred city of Lhasa, Grant had to breach the formidable fortress of Gyantse Jong, which sat on top of a sheer cliff face. Terrain: Grant travelled to Tibet to negotiate with the Dalai Lama, but first had to overcome a cliff face fort. An illustration by London News in 1904 shows how difficult the attack would have been . Grant led the storming party of Gurkhas to capture the fortress on the 6th July 1904. He was the first Gurkha to scale the sheer rock-face but was wounded by the enemy. But Grant climbed over into enemy territory and led his men to victory. Times Correspondent Perceval Landon, filed a witness account of the storming of the fortress in 1904. He wrote: ‘They reached at last the crumbling wreckage of the Tibetan wall. ‘Leutenent Grant and his faithful follower were the first two men over, and the great semi-circle of the watching British force held their breath to see if they would be at once shot down.’ Companions: He led a company of Ghurka soldiers into battle but was shot and wounded during a 'fracas' He was awarded a the Victoria Cross by Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on July 24, 1905. Grant was also awarded a Distinguished Service Order and Order of the Bath, which were also sold alongside the Victoria Cross. Michael Naxton, the curator of The Ashcroft Collection, said: ‘I can assure you Lord Ashcroft will be absolutely delighted to have such an interesting addition to the collection. ‘It will fill a notable gap in the collection. ‘ . Daunting: The terrifying cliff face that John Grant had to scale in order to reach and fight the enemy . Auctioneer James Morton said: ‘It’s a wonderful outcome as the medal will stay in British ownership and will be on display. It’s a very unique Victoria Cross as it is the only medal awarded for the campaign in Tibet and has a great story behind it.’ Grant, who was born in India but educated at Cheltenham College, continued his service in India during the First World War and also served in the Third Afghan War. During the Second World War Grant served with the Home Guard in London and he died in a nursing home in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in 1967. Programme: A cover for the Anniversary dinner held on July 1905 in London was also revealed.

"By . Tania Steere . Missing: Amy Latham, 18, had recently finished her A-levels and was planning a gap year to visit her sister Rachel in Australia . A body believed to be that of a missing teenager was found in woods near her family home last night. Amy Latham was last seen on Monday afternoon and a full-scale search was launched. The 18-year-old had previously tweeted that she ‘felt like crying’ over her exam revision. The tragic discovery near her family's £300,000 home in Wimborne, Dorset, came hours after her father Graham Latham made a heartfelt plea for her to return. Mr Latham released a message yesterday saying: ‘I just want you to get in touch with us, we won’t be angry, we just want you back.’ The 55-year-old described his daughter as ‘very kind, outgoing and much loved by her friends’. A post on a Facebook appeal page last night said: 'The Latham family are devastated to say that Amy's body has been found. They want to thank Amy's friends and family for their support.' Amy – who was 18 last week – had recently finished her A-levels and was planning a gap year to visit her sister Rachel in Australia. But in the weeks leading up to her disappearance, the pupil at Queen Elizabeth's School in Wimborne had expressed anxiety about her exams on social media sites. On June 5 she posted to her followers on Twitter: ‘Option 1: stay in, cry over Macbeth notes, fail English A-level Option 2: go out, cry over ignored responsibilities, fail English A-level.’ On May 15 she said: ‘Someone kill me before I f*** up my English exam for the second time in a row.’ A-level exams were taken during June and . results are due to be released on August 14. But friends today took to . social media to suggest Amy had other 'complex' issues in her life. The discovery of the body in woods near her home came just hours after her father Graham made a heartfelt plea for his daughter to return home . Ethan Jones wrote on Facebook: ‘I, along with many others of Amy's friends, are utterly disgusted with the way that Amy has been portrayed especially as she had a lot of other complex things going on in her life and something as trivial as her A-levels were probably the least of her worries.’ The girl was last seen by a neighbour in a . field behind her house at 1.30pm on Monday. She then texted a friend at . around 2.30pm, but after that no one heard from her. Amy, who turned 18 last week, did not . take any clothes or money with her when she disappeared from her home on . Monday morning. She did take her mobile phone with her and last made contact with a friend at 2.30pm. Mr Latham said: ‘I saw her on Monday morning before I went to work about 7.30am and said goodbye and blew her a kiss. 'After that she had the house to herself and the neighbour last saw her in a field behind our house around 1.30pm.’ Find: The discovery of the body came near her family's £300,000 home on this road in Wimborne, Dorset . Police . have referred the case to the Dorset coroner. A post-mortem examination is . due to take place tomorrow. Martin McLeman, headteacher of the Queen Elizabeth's School, described Amy as a ‘delightful, hardworking student’. He said: ‘We are devastated by this news. All our thoughts are with her family and friends at this extremely sad time. ‘Amy was a delightful, hardworking student who was very popular with both staff and students. She will be greatly missed. ‘Although . Year 13 have finished their exams and have officially left school, . counselling and support will be available to them and everyone in the . school community affected by this tragic event.’ 'Amy was a delightful, hardworking student who was very popular with both staff and students. She will be greatly missed' Martin McLeman, school headteacher . Amy's mother Sue, 51, is separated from the girl's father and lives in nearby Sturminster Marshall. Friends today left bunches of flowers outside Amy's house in Wimborne as a mark of respect. The message on one bunch propped up against the front door of the house reads: ‘Graham, Sue and Rachel. There are no words in the English language that could even begin to describe the loss of our beautiful Amy. ‘My thoughts are with you always. Amy will never leave our hearts. All my love, Hannah.’ Another said ‘Graham, Sue and Rachel. I honestly have no words for this tragedy, it has left my heart aching. Just know that I am thinking of you all. Our beloved Amy will be the brightest shining star up there. All my love, Rosie Finn.’ A third card said: ‘Graham, Sue and Rachel. I honestly don't know what to say, just want you to know our thoughts and prayers are with you all. With love and hugs? Jo and Paul.’ Shocked neighbours who knew Amy also paid tribute to her. Maria Hayter, 47, an assistant manager, said: ‘I have lived here for about 11 years and they have been there since just after us. Home: Amy, who lived in the market town of Wimborne (pictured) was 'very kind, outgoing and much loved by her friends' ‘I have seen Amy since she was little as my son went to school with her. A couple of times, if she had lost her key, she would come in here so she was safe when her dad was at work. ‘I don't know anything about what happened on Monday. All I know is that Graham came back from work and found out she wasn't there. ‘He popped over to me and all the neighbours and asked if anybody had seen her. It's really shocking, especially having kids of a similar age. It makes you go cold. ‘She would have just finished her exams, she had her whole life ahead of her. I feel for the family and know her dad must be terribly distraught.’ 'Someone kill me before I f*** up my English exam for the second time in a row' Amy Latham, writing in May . And people took to social media to . leave tributes to the teenager. One said: ‘Rest in Peace Amy Latham, you . will always be an angel.’ Another added: ‘It’s one of those things that you just can’t believe...RIP Amy, thoughts are with her friends and family.’ Hannah Boon wrote: ‘Thank you for so many incredible memories. Rest in peace you perfect human being, we'll never forget you.’ And Jenny Ireland said: ‘You were, and still are, amazing. Thanks for your friendship to me and so many others that will feel the empty space that you have left. RIP Amy Latham.’ Heather Revitt added: ‘We are so desperately sad that this has happened to such a wonderful family. Our hearts go out to you Sue, Graham and Rachel. We will all miss Amy's beautiful smile. RIP.’ Another student said she shared a room with her on holiday and she ‘was so kind, friendly and caring’. A spokesman for Dorset Police said: ‘Sadly a body has been found which is believed to be the missing teenager from Wimborne. Her next of kin and a coroner have been informed.’ Police are not treating the death as suspicious. Before the discovery, officers said that they were ‘gravely concerned’ for Amy’s welfare.","Amy Latham, 18, from Wimborne, Dorset, last seen on Monday afternoon .

"By . Tania Steere . Sir Mick Jagger has found comfort in the arms of a mystery brunette, it was reported last night. The Rolling Stones singer was pictured smiling and obviously enjoying life again on his hotel balcony with an attractive young woman, sparking speculation he may have a new girlfriend. Sir Mick, 70, was left distraught when his partner of 13 years, L’Wren Scott, killed herself in her Manhattan apartment in March aged 49. Lovers: Sir Mick Jagger and L'Wren Scott were lovers for 13 years . The Stones were forced to cancel their Australian tour as a result of the tragedy. At the time, Sir Mick, who was pictured looking drawn and unwell, told fans in a statement he was ‘shocked and devastated’. He said: ‘We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves.’ Sir Mick described his partner, a fashion designer, as having ‘had great presence’, adding: ‘Her talent was much admired, not least  by me.’ The new pictures suggest he is finally putting the tragedy behind him and attempting to move on with his life. He was photographed on the balcony of his penthouse suite in Switzerland with a brunette several decades younger than him. According to The Sun, which published the pictures, the pair met in a Zurich nightclub last weekend and spent two days together. They were seen on Saturday morning smiling and looking carefree. In the afternoon, Sir Mick reportedly emerged from his room bare-chested to speak on the phone. The couple appeared again on Saturday night, with Sir Mick wearing a striped shirt and the woman clutching a drink. A source in Zurich told The Sun: ‘He’s worked very hard to get the Stones back on the road. He’s a single man and he’s Mick and he’s having some fun.’ The Stones spent four days in the Swiss city as part of their  world tour. Loss: Sir Mick cancelled the Rolling Stone's tour of Australia following the fashion designer's death in March . Sir Mick and Keith Richards, 70, Ronnie Wood, 67, and Charlie Watts, 73, are due to play at the Pinkpop Festival in Holland  this evening. The band resumed their world tour in Norway at the end of May  after cancelling shows following Miss Scott’s death. Her body was discovered in her Manhattan apartment by her assistant at around 10am on March 17. It emerged after her death that the fashion label she founded  had been heavily in debt. Sir Mick has said previously that he failed ‘to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way’. He said that the couple had spent ‘many wonderful  years together’.","Sir Mick Jagger seen with a mystery brunette while on holiday, reports claim .

"By . Ian Drury . and Tania Steere . An infatuated Royal Air Force officer was jailed yesterday for filming a naked lesbian colleague at their barracks. Flying Officer Jonathan Cook, 30, sneaked into the woman’s room and hid a video camera under her desk, a court martial was told. He then retrieved the camera and sent pictures of the unsuspecting nude woman to her girlfriend, using a false name on Facebook, in a bid to destroy their relationship. 'Moment of madness': Flying Officer Jonathan Cook has been given 14 months military detention and been dismissed from the RAF in disgrace after he secretly filmed a colleague in her room at RAF Shawbury . The shamed airman wanted her to believe his victim was having an affair and hoped the pair would split up. But Cook’s crime was exposed when he gave too much information on the false Facebook profile he had created in the name of ‘Emma Oxbum’. The female officer confronted him and he admitted being behind the account and taking the video footage. Police investigated and found images of the woman on his  laptop and mobile phone and several pairs of her underwear in his room. Yesterday Cook was given 14 months’ military detention after admitting one count of voyeurism and two counts of harassment against the lesbian couple.He was dismissed from the RAF in disgrace. Cook was based at RAF Shawbury in Shropshire, where helicopter aircrew and instructors and air controllers, including those about to deploy on operations, are trained. Lieutenant Colonel David Phillips, prosecuting, told the court martial that Cook knew the victim’s daily routine and how she used the communal shower each afternoon. He entered her room while she was showering to ‘carefully place’ the camera under her desk. It was set to record for 29 minutes and captured her in ‘various states of undress’, the court martial heard. Lt Col Phillips said: ‘The female officer was, at the time, in a same-sex relationship and that fact was known to the defendant. ‘He had a social relationship with her but the defendant became infatuated with her and this infatuation got to a point where he wanted a relationship with her. ‘He set upon a course of trying to split them up by creating a false female profile on Facebook under the name Emma Oxbum and began sending messages. ‘He started to engage in conversation pretending to be a female interested in both women, sending sexually explicit private messages. ‘He told her partner she had been cheating with other men and women and to back up this point he sent a pixelated naked photo of her over Facebook.’ But Cook, who had served in the RAF since 2010, was unmasked when he mentioned something that was personal and only he and his colleague knew about. Scene of the crime: Cook committed the crime at RAF Cranwell, pictured, in Lincolnshire while he was undergoing initial officer training, before he moved to RAF Shawbury to train to be an air traffic controller . The couple – both in the RAF – said in victim impact statements that the incident had left them close to breaking up. The woman who Cook recorded on video said: ‘All aspects of my life have been affected. Filming me and stealing my underwear makes me feel violated.’ Graham Wallis, defending, told Bulford Court Martial Centre in Wiltshire that Cook ‘deeply regretted’ letting his ‘emotions cloud his professional judgment’ and apologised for a ‘moment of complete madness’. Sentencing Cook, Judge  Robert Hill said: ‘You became obsessed in starting a relationship with her and became desperate that the chance was slipping away. But this ploy was unravelled when she saw a reference about something only you and her knew about and she smelt a rat.’ Cook committed the crime at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire while he was undergoing initial officer training, before he moved to RAF Shawbury to train to be an air traffic controller.","Flying Officer Jonathan Cook snuck into the woman's room and hid a camera .

"By . Tania Steere . Cricket legend Ian Botham didn’t visit his dying father for the final six months of his life - because he didn’t want to see how dementia had ravaged him. The sport star’s dad, Les Botham, died aged 82 after suffering from Alzheimer’s for more than a decade. Sir Ian admitted last night that he had purposefully avoided going to the hospital where he was dying - and has advised his children not to either. Decline: Sir Ian Botham, pictured in 1987 with his father Les, avoided visiting him in hospital in his final months, as he couldn't recognise anyone. Sir Ian's father is spoke for the first time about his father's death in 2005 . Painful: Sir Ian recalled how his father - a keen sportsman - couldn't remember how to play gold while standing over the ball . He said: ‘I might sound brutal, but I’m just being honest. Unless you’ve watched a loved one being ravaged by this disease, you can’t understand how horrendous it is. I didn’t want my memory of him to be distorted by the illness that robbed him of himself.’ One in 14 Britons over the age of 65 and one in six people over 80 years of age now suffers from some form of dementia. The former cricketer, who has three children and ﬁve grandchildren, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘There was no point going to see him because he got no comfort from it; he didn’t know who he was never mind who I was.’ Sir Ian revealed the painful details of his father’s 2005 death from Alzheimer’s to support National Dementia Week, which ended today. Support: Sir Ian revealed the details of his father's last days as part of a dementia awareness campaign . About 800,000 people suffer from dementia in the UK and the figure is expected to rise to one million by 2021, according to the Alzheimer’s Society. In most cases the dementia is caused by Alzheimer’s, a progressive disease that damages the brain. Responding to growing concern, the Government has pledged to double funding for research into cure or effective treatment by 2025. A number of celebrities have spoken of the effects of the disease on their parents in an attempt to raise public understanding of dementia. The disease is notoriously hard to diagnose. Sir Ian said his father’s illness wasn’t immediately recognised by doctors. He only realised how serious his father’s condition was on the green at Yeovil Golf Club. ‘My dad seemed ﬁne, but as he stood over the ball, he turned to me and asked “What do I do now?” with genuine bafﬂement,’ he said. ‘The man taught me to play golf when I was three, but he had forgotten how to play it.’ Sir Ian added: ‘My dad would have been mortified if he had known what sort of humiliation lay ahead. ‘He would have thrown himself off a cliff rather than end up the way he did.’","Cricket legend said disease would have 'distorted' memories of Les Botham .

"By . Tania Steere . A family found an unwelcome surprise in their salad as they sat down to eat their dinner – a live two-inch locust. Richard Loughton, 53, was dishing out the M&S Italian-style baby leaf salad to go with their pasta bake on Friday night when he noticed a ‘huge’ locust crawling around in the packet. He pointed it out to his wife Helen, 51, and daughter Kate, 20, who were horrified. Richard Loughton, 53, found a two-inch locust in a bag of Marks & Spencer Italian-style baby leaf salad, as he dished up dinner to his family . Kate, who is a healthcare assistant, said: ‘We managed to clip the bag shut but it kept crawling round inside it. I think because we opened the bag and gave it some oxygen it perked up and started munching on the lettuce. It was such a shock.’ Locusts are larger than . grasshoppers and can be found in more than 60 countries.They are a . farmer’s worst enemy because they descend in swarms and devastate crops. Helen read the packet, which said the salad was ‘produced in more than one country’. She said: ‘It could have come from anywhere.’ M&S have said the salad comes from their ‘trusted suppliers’ in Spain and Italy. Kate added: ‘It really ruined our Friday night dinner. It was disgusting. I have no idea how it got in there without anybody noticing, it was huge, about two inches. You just don’t expect to open your salad and for there to be a locust inside.’ Richard, who is an engineer, purchased the salad from the Marylebone branch on his way home to High Wycombe from work. The family rang M&S and asked what they should do with the locust and they were told to return the salad to their local store. The locust was still alive and moving around inside the packet when Helen took the salad back the next day. The family were given just £10 in compensation. This is the second locust found in a packaged salad in just one month. A Waitrose customer also found a locust in her watercress, spinach and rocket salad at the beginning of April. Kate said she’s going to be avoiding M&S salads for a while and checking what she eats very thoroughly. A spokeswoman for M&S said: ‘We’re very sorry to hear about the customer’s complaint. Quality is extremely important to us and we are working closely with our supplier to investigate the incident further.’","Richard Loughton, 53, from High Wycombe, spotted the 'huge' locust .

Available in seven varieties, the Woof & Brew herbal blends promise perks for your pet such as better breath and a shinier coat. Humans  could be enjoying a cup of tea with their pets thanks to launch of a range of new teabags especially for dogs (file picture) Creator Steve Bennett said: ‘Owners have reported good feedback and lots of benefits.’ However, at £9.99 for 28 teabags, they’re likely to be fetched for only the most pampered pooches. Each teabag makes one litre of tea, which can be cooled and stored for a week. Mr Bennett, 48, said: ‘We used to run a tea-shop and many dog owners would say their dogs like to have a cup of tea, but the caffeine and milk in the tea isn’t really suitable for dogs. So we came up with a range of herbal teas they can enjoy without negative effects.’ He has two rescue dogs, Billy and Angel, who have both given the product their seal of approval. He added: ‘Some dogs take to it straight . away – Billy went mad for it - and others take a few days to get used to . it, but owners have reported good feedback and lots of benefits.’ The most popular tea is Ha-pee Lawns, which is a blend of golden rod, yucca root and tomato flakes, and is said to help reduces lawn damage created by dog urine. The product was tested by 200 dogs and 80 per cent of owners said they noticed an improvement in their lawns. The herbal brew was launched last June by Mr Bennetts’s company Woof & Brew, but Steve is hoping to expand the business and export worldwide.

"By . Tania Steere . and Ian Drury . The cost of Britain’s ‘failed’ war on terror in Afghanistan and Iraq has reached almost £30 billion. Despite the high cost, the interventions have been branded ‘strategic failures’ by a respected defence think-tank. Toppling Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein helped radicalise young Muslims in the UK and far from reducing international terrorism, the Iraq war ‘had the effect of promoting it’, according to the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). Horror: A British soldier, his clothes on fire, jumps from a tank in Basra, Iraq, in 2005 . Critics said the cost of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and sending thousands of troops to Helmand province in Afghanistan in 2006 - around £30billion and 627 lives lost - was simply not worth the results. The Mail first revealed last month that the authoritative study, Wars In Peace, estimated the cost of military operations since the Cold War as high as £72billion. The study calculated the cost of UK military interventions after the collapse of Communism, from the first Gulf War in 1990-91 to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and EU training missions last year, from Ministry of Defence freedom of information responses. The bill for military action in the past 24 years was £34.7billion. The sum is enough to pay nearly 5,000 nurses or police officers for their entire career, or fund free university tuition for all higher education students for a decade. This included £20.6billion in Afghanistan and £9.6billion during the Iraq war - 84 per cent of the total. Another £1.5billion was spent in Bosnia and £1.1billion in Kosovo on peacekeeping missions and £238million on the war in Libya. The bill for military action in the past 24 years was £34.7billion. The figures do not include what the Armed Forces would have been spending on their normal running costs such as training exercises, fuel, accommodation and pay. The study also estimates another £30billion may have to be spent on long-term care for war veterans and compensation payments for deaths and injuries could add another £7billion - bringing the total cost to £71.7billion. In the study, military analysts said the UK had succeeded in six out of ten major military operations - but failed in four. Interventions in the first Gulf War, Sierra Leone in 2000 and the start of operations in Afghanistan in 2001 which drove out Al Qaeda and the Taliban leadership were among those praised. But the UK failed in Bosnia in the early 1990s, the 2003 invasion in Iraq, the deployment of troops to the insurgents’ stronghold of Helmand and the air strikes in Libya which helped oust Colonel Gaddafi but fuelled a brutal civil war. RUSI’s most scathing criticism is reserved for the Iraq deployment. It said: ‘Far from reducing international terrorism... the invasion had the effect of promoting it. ‘The rise of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) was a reaction to this invasion, and to the consequent marginalisation of Iraq’s Sunni population. The cost of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and sending thousands of troops to Helmand province in Afghanistan in 2006 comes to around £30billion . ‘Today, AQAP and other radical jihadist groups stretching across the Iraqi-Syrian border, pose new terrorist threats to the UK and its allies that might not have existed, at least in this form, had Saddam remained in power.’ Sir David Omand, former senior security and intelligence adviser to Mr Blair, said that the term ‘War on Terror’ may have ‘helped to create the sense of an inevitable conflict between the west and the world of Islam’. However, he said Britain was now a safer place than at the time of the September 11 attacks on the US. The study said military action in Iraq and Afghanistan had dented the reputation of the Armed Forces and reduced the appetite for further overseas interventions. The failure of Parliament to vote for operations against Syria last year took place ‘in the shadow of Iraq’, said RUSI. An MOD spokesman said: ‘Over the last 13 years the international military campaign in Afghanistan has reduced the terrorist threat from this region and helped train a 350,000 strong Afghan National Security Force who now have lead security responsibility for Afghanistan’s 30 million citizens. ‘Development and diplomatic activities have also improved the lives of Afghan people and helped deliver basic needs, such as access to health, education and the opportunity to vote.’","Cost of Britain's 'failed' war on terror in Afghanistan and Iraq reaches £30b .

Koshu has been grown to be eaten as a fresh table grape in Japan for a thousand years but only in the last 100 years has it been made into wine. It is new to the EU as it was only officially recognised as a wine grape in 2010. Koshu varieties are rarely seen on wine lists but occasionally they can be found in Japanese restaurants for around £60 per bottle. So if you are seeking a taste of the exotic without the high price tag, the £12.99 Sol Lucet Koshu may come as a relief. It is currently being trialled in 70 stores and if successful will be rolled out nationwide. It will also be available online in the coming weeks. M&S wine buyer Emma Dawson decided to list the wine after the success of the M&S Eastern Mediterranean wine range, which was introduced in 2012. She said: ‘We are excited to bring such a rare and previously specialist wine to a wider public. Until now, Japanese wine has not been something you would expect to find on the high street. 'The dazzling lemongrass flavours match brilliantly with sushi and Japanese food.’ Daily Mail wine reviewer Helen McGinn tried out the Sol Lucet Koshu. She said: ‘I know the old adage about books and covers but let’s start with the label. It’s rather lovely, actually. ‘The wine is called Sol Lucet (meaning “the sun shines”) and it is made from the thick-skinned, white Koshu grape grown in vineyards in the Yamanashi region on the main island of Honshu. 'The weather is extreme (to put it mildly) so making good wine in Japan is not easy. But I tip my hat to the M&S winemaker, who has sniffed out a gem here. The £12.99 bottle of wine is made from Koshu grapes which are grown at the foot of Mount Fuji . ‘On sticking my nose in the glass, having given it a good swirl, there is a gentle hug of lemon. And the taste? 'Deliciously, refreshingly light (it is just 11.5 per cent abv) with more citrus fruit flavours and a bit of apple too. 'It is not unlike Pinot Grigio, but with a splash of added interest because of where it comes from. ‘The label tells me it will go with sushi and tempura and I can see why it would work, given the delicate flavours and freshness of the wine. 'But my glass was quite happy with a bowl of lightly salted crisps. Just make sure it is really nicely chilled, even if the sun isn’t shining.’","White Koshu grapes used to make wine are grown at the base of Mount Fuji .

"By . Tania Steere . Doctors will be prosecuted for performing sex-selective abortions, the Department of Health will warn today. They will be reminded the practice is ‘unacceptable and illegal’, as Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and the General Medical Council closes a ‘loophole’ used by prosecutors to avoid bringing charges against doctors who carry out abortions based on the sex of the foetus. The guidance is expected to draw a line  under the issue, making it clear that doctors who pre-sign abortion forms and carry out abortions based on gender are breaking the law and will be prosecuted. Health minister Jeremy Hunt will today warn doctors that performing gender-selective abortions is 'unacceptable and illegal' Abortion clinics will also be required to recognise that gender-based abortions are illegal as part of their licence conditions. The guidance has been re-issued . following a Crown Prosecution Service ruling in September that said it . would not be in the ‘public interest’ to prosecute doctors who had . carried out gender-based abortions. Sir Kier Stammer, the then Director of Public Prosecutions, said the law did not 'prohibit gender-specific abortions'. It was found that 67 physicians were involved in pre-signing abortion forms without knowing anything about the women involved. The General Medical Council (GMC), the doctors’ regulator, ruled out action against the doctors. That, combined with the CPS ruling led to concerns that the practice was effectively legalised. The Department of Health last night stressed that abortions based on gender were illegal. Under the 1967 Abortion Act, a pregnancy can be terminated legally if two doctors agree the physical or mental health of the child or the woman is in jeopardy . Under the 1967 Abortion Act, a pregnancy can be terminated legally if two doctors agree the physical or mental health of the child or the woman is in jeopardy. The Act makes clear that they must sign to certify that they formed the opinion ‘in good faith’. However, MPs have raised concern that the law does not explicitly state that abortions on the basis of gender are illegal. Tory MP David Burrowes told The Telegraph: ‘It is a very helpful clarification. As a matter of principle and practise, gender selection is thoroughly outlawed.’ Marie Stopes International’s UK Director of Policy, Genevieve Edwards said: 'We welcome this guidance from the Department of Health. 'It’s important that every doctor has absolute clarity about the letter and spirit of the law. 'Our focus has always been to provide high quality services for women who need them within the legal framework of this country and we will continue to do so.' Ann Furedi, chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas), added: 'One in three women will need an abortion because their contraception fails, their life circumstances suddenly change, or a problem is found with a much wanted pregnancy. 'Recently, doctors providing abortion services have felt under intense political scrutiny, and this document should give them the reassurance that neither the law nor regulations have changed to accommodate those who think their work is wrong. 'However, abortion remains a criminal offence and this guidance is about meeting the requirements of the law not those of women or doctors. The law impedes best practice. 'There is no clinical need for two doctors to certify a woman’s reasons for abortion, in addition to obtaining her consent, it simply causes delays. Bpas trusts women to make responsible choices and Bpas doctors comply with the law.'","Minister of State will remind doctors gender-selective abortions are illegal .

"By . Tania Steere . Cilla Black, 71, who has joined the euthanasia debate admitting that she doesn't want to live too long . Veteran TV star Cilla Black joined the euthanasia debate last night, admitting she still thinks 75 is ‘a good age to go’. ‘I still think that way,’ the 71-year-old Blind Date presenter told the Daily Mirror. ‘If things are starting to drop off – like the hearing – and I’ve got twinges in the morning, I do think that.’ Her own mother suffered from the progressive bone disease osteoporosis and endured a slow and painful end. ‘She said to me once, “I’m trying to die but I can’t”, oh God it was heart breaking. The brain was great but the body wasn’t,’ she said. ‘Eventually when she did die she was 84, it wasn’t a good experience. I think that’s what has made me feel like this. ‘My biggest fear is going like that when I can’t control my body.’ However, the mother-of-three, who also has two grandsons, said that although she agreed with clinics like Dignitas in Switzerland, where people can end their own lives, she didn’t plan to take matters into her own hands. She added: ‘I agree with Dignitas, but I couldn’t be the one to administer the poison that kills me. I know I couldn’t commit suicide. I’m too much of a coward, I couldn’t do it. I’d rather somebody make that decision for me.’ Best known for presenting Blind Date from 1985 to 2003, Miss Black has not officially retired but rarely makes TV appearances. She had been due to star in a BBC sitcom with chat show host Paul O’Grady but the project was axed amid concerns she would be unable to stand the long filming hours. Miss Black began her career more than 50 years ago as a singer, and had a string of top ten hits in the Sixties and Seventies. Miss Black, pictured here making her last appearance on Blind Date in 2003. She has not officially retired but rarely makes TV appearances . After a brief time as a comedy actress, she became a TV presenter in the 1980s. Her husband Bobby Willis, who died in 1999 from cancer, was her manager for much of her career. On Sunday she will collect a TV BAFTA special award in recognition of her outstanding contribution to entertainment. She will receive the prize at the event - officially called the Arqiva British Academy Television Awards - on May 18 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in London and it will also be broadcast by BBC1. It coincides with a new biopic of her life, starring actress Sheridan Smith. The ITV drama from Jeff Pope will ‘capture the essence of 1960s Liverpool’. It will also focus on how Black’s friendship with Ringo Starr brought her to the attention of Beatles' manager Brian Epstein and producer George Martin.","Veteran TV star aged 71 says she still thinks 75 is 'a good age to go'

"By . Tania Steere . and Lizzie Parry . Pictured for the first time today is the primary school teacher two ten-year-old boys allegedly tried to poison just one day after the killing of Ann Maguire. The two pupils reportedly poured a deadly bleach-like chemical into teacher Emma Place's stainless steel coffee flask while her back was turned. Emma, 39, was about to take a sip of the poisoned drink when another pupil told her what had happened. She was said to have opened the container and was overwhelmed by the toxic smell. The pupils have been disciplined, though Clapha, Terrace Community Primary School in Leamington Spa, declined to say what punishment had been to the boys. Clapham Terrace Community Primary School teacher Emma Place (pictured) was reportedly the target of a poisoning attempt, when two 10-year-old boys allegedly poured a deadly bleach-like chemical into her coffee . Chairman of the Governing Body at the school today said the school's main concern is to protect the best interests of its pupils and staff. Philip Robbins, said: 'During the first week of the summer term, two of our older pupils added a home-made concoction, believed to be a mixture of bathroom products, to a teacher's drink on her desk in the classroom. 'The teacher was alerted to this and did not drink her drink. 'With the co-operation of their parents, the two pupils concerned were removed from their normal lessons and were disciplined by the school, in a manner consistent with the school's normal pastoral policy. 'Pupils will receive ongoing guidance and counselling within school. 'Owing to the nature of the incident, the police were informed and liaised with the headteacher. Neither the teacher concerned nor the school intends to press charges. 'Clapham Terrace School is proud of its reputation as a caring school where pupils' behaviour and the school's pastoral care are of a very high standard. 'Our main concern, following this incident, is to protect the best interests of our children and their families, and to support the teacher concerned, and other members of staff so that the school can put this incident behind it and continue with its normal business of providing a high quality of education for its pupils.' Police were called to the Warwickshire school last Tuesday, where the flask was seized. In a statement confirming that disciplinary action had been taken, Clapham Terrace's chair of governors, Philip Robbins, said the teacher involved did not wish to press criminal charges.Mr Robbins said: 'During the first week of the summer term, two of our older pupils added a home-made concoction, believed to be a mixture of bathroom products, to a teacher's drink on her desk in the classroom. 'The teacher was alerted to this and did not drink her drink. 'With the cooperation of their parents, the two pupils concerned were removed from their normal lessons and were disciplined by the school, in a manner consistent with the school's normal pastoral policy.' It is believed the two pupils belonged to a gang at the school who called themselves 'The mafia', who had drawn up a 'hit list' of six teachers. It has been suggested that the boys who poured the bleach-like liquid into their teacher's coffee were 'having a joke that went wrong' it emerged today. A parent, whose son is friends with one of the boys, said: 'From my perspective it's pranking that got the children into this trouble. 'The children have been spoken to and they are trying to move on from it. 'One of them is a great friend of my son and not a wayward lad. 'The parents are very upset. They both come from good families and they have dealt with it. 'The boys are very upset and the school is very good. The teachers are well liked. I think my son has been a bit upset about it. 'I just think their imagination got the better of them. As far I was aware it had been dealt with and now it has been all blown out of proportion. 'I think things had gone back to normal. The boys are ok, one of them is a bit of a wild card. It was a big shock really. 'We have had four boys at that school and it is a really shame. It is a really lovely old Victorian school. 'With the cooperation of their parents, . the two pupils concerned were removed from their normal lessons and were . disciplined by the school, in a manner consistent with the school's . normal pastoral policy' - Philip Robbins, chair of Governors . 'The teacher who it happened to was their supply teacher as their teacher was off having an operation. 'I think this one could be strict but their SATS are coming up. It just got out of hand. Clearly a joke that went wrong. 'I think the boys and their families have been very upset since they realised how serious it was what they had done.' Parents and former staff members today told of their 'shock' at what had happened. The . boys were suspended following the incident at Clapham Terrace Community . Primary School in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, which caters for 191 . children aged 3-11. Meanwhile it emerged the girl who informed on the two boys was presented with a special bravery award at the school assembly. Warwickshire . Police were called into the school and quizzed the youngsters about the . alleged poison plot - just 24 hours after tragic teacher Ann Maguire . was stabbed to death in the classroom in Leeds. The boys were not arrested and are now believed to be allowed back into school. Police were called to Clapham Terrace Community Primary School in Leamington Spa, Warwick after the incident . Today a former member of staff expressed her shock at the incident. A former teaching assistant, who left the school 15 years ago, said: 'I am genuinely shocked. 'There . are some kids that cause problems but you get that in any school but . not like this and so soon after that teacher was killed. It is really . worrying. 'I . just hope the children didn't really know what they were doing. It is a . wonderful school. I didn't want to leave but my contract ended. 'I did all my training there and now I'm in a secondary school where a lot of the kids come on to. 'They are always very nice children, it really is such a shock.' And parents told of their horror that the boys had been allowed to have bleach in school. Daniel Taylor, 40, whose son attends the school, said: 'It's horrific to think these kids are walking around with bleach in their school bags and then have the idea to actually put into a teacher's coffee. 'Who knows if the murder of the teacher in Leeds (Ann Maguire) somehow inspired these lads to try and kill off their own teacher. The shocking incident came just days after the killing of teacher Ann Maguire in Leeds . 'God knows what was going through their heads but it's more than worrying. 'It's obviously time schools searched pupils bags every day. 'It's sad to admit, but maybe schools in this country aren't as safe as everyone would hope. 'The girl who told the teacher about the bleach received an award at assembly last week. 'The pupils weren't told the exact details of what she did but she was said to have been ""very brave"" because of her actions.' Another parent . told The Sun: 'A small gang had formed calling themselves the mafia. They had apparently written down a list of six teachers. 'It's . impossible to say how much malice was behind it, or whether it was . simply a playground prank that went too far. 'This is a good, friendly . primary school so no one can understand how this incident has happened. 'It . has left the parents who know about it in shock. 'Particularly coming in . the same week as the tragedy of the teacher killed in Leeds.' Philip Robbins, chair of governors, said . yesterday: 'We are just interested in protecting the interests of the . teachers and the families. 'The police are involved and we just want to draw a line under it. 'Emma dealt with it well. Of course the school is giving her support. 'The school has dealt with the situation appropriately and we're hoping to move on. It was put in the hands of the police. 'Neither the school nor the teacher are pressing charges. The pupils were not arrested as far as I'm aware. Nobody knows what the substance was.' A spokesman for Warwickshire Police said: 'Police were called to Clapham Community Primary School following a concern for a person's safety. Officers provided advice to pupils and teaching staff. 'God knows what was going through their heads but it's more than worrying. It's obviously time schools searched pupils bags every day' - Shocked parent Daniel Taylor . 'It was determined it was an isolated incident and was dealt with internally by the school. 'The evidence was taken away by police but were guided by the school that it was an isolated incident that got out of hand. I don't think the pupils realised the seriousness or the severity of the situation.' The incident came less than a week after Ann Maguire, 61, was stabbed to death by a one of her students at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds. Shop owner Taj Singh, 40, who runs a newsagents next to the school and knows many of the pupils by name, said: 'I can't believe that has happened. It seems a very good school. 'Everyday the kids and teachers come in here and we have a good relationship with them. We never have any problems with them.' Meanwhile a woman who lives next to the school and reads stories to the younger pupils a few times a week, added: 'I was in the school last Thursday and Friday and I didn't hear anything about it. 'It is such a nice, sweet school. There are never any problems. You obviously get the old child but nothing like this. It is terrible. Let's hope it is a one off.'","Primary school children put toxic substance into teacher's coffee flask .

"By . Mia De Graaf . People often say that dogs are man's best friend. But these cats could give them a run for their money. From life-savers to survivors, the incredible stories that emerged from this year's National Cat Awards are certainly something of a win for social media's favourite pet. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Incredible stories: Hero Cat of the year Cleo (left)  rushed for help when her owner had a heart attack. Nelson (right) survived after being thrown in the sea tied in a sack . Ready for action: Slinky Malinki was a runner up for Hero Cat for tapping on a neighbour's window when his owner passed out after taking prescribed morphine . Hundreds entered the revered contest's five categories: Hero Cat, Most Caring Cat, Most Incredible Story, Outstanding Rescue Cat and the public vote category. Today, the final five of the competition, in support of Cat's Protection to encourage people to adopt cats, were revealed in a ceremony at London's Savoy Hotel. The Hero Cat award went to 15-year-old Cleo, who rushed for help when her owner Richard Jenkins was having a heart attack. Trying and failing to call his wife downstairs, Mr Jenkins was left struggling for breath in his room. But Cleo pounced into action, running up and down the stairs until Pauline, confused, followed her up to calm her down. She reached her husband just in time and called 999. He is now recovering well. The incredible story is one of the five heart-warming tales that have won over the judges at this year's National Cat Awards. Cleo, who still lives with Mr and Mrs Jenkins in Chessington, Surrey, took the title ahead of Smudge, who pounced on a gang of boys attacking his five-year-old owner. Slinky Malinki, a black cat from Todmorden, West Yorkshire, was also commended as a runner-up for tapping on a neighbour's window when his owner, Janet, passed out after being prescribed morphine for her chronic back pain. Got your back: Smudge (left) pounced on a gang of boys that were attacking his five-year-old owner. Elias (right) helped his Army veteran owner recover from PTSD . The pub mascot: Legz, who has three legs, was awarded the top prize for rescue cats as he has inspired pub-goers at the Charlotte Despard pub in Archway, north London, to adopt a cat themselves. People come from all over to donate presents - from catnip to toys - to the three-year-old ginger tabby . Guy (left) was a runner up in the public vote category. He was found abandoned in a cardboard box in Birmingham by owner Hazel Norris shortly after her husband died. He has helped her cope and helped her autistic son learn social skills. Jessie (right) was also nominated for helping her teenaged owner through a tough school . Lifeline: Mr Chips, who is permanently disabled after badly breaking his leg, has helped his owner Ian Turner of Llandudno in Conwy, Wales, cope with the strain of a dozen operations which affected both his mental and physical health, leaving him at times suicidal. Last night, he won the public vote award for best cat . But it was 20-year-old Nelson who took the Most Incredible Story award. Having used up a fair few of his nine lives, Nelson was thrown into the sea in a sack as a kitten. He was one of only two of his littermates to survive when a fisherman pulled them from the waves. For the following few years, he lived rough on the docks near Seaham, County Durham. One night, he was targeted by a gang of rock-wielding youths, leaving him with just one eye. And he now suffers from an inoperable heart condition, diagnosed in January 2014. But, now in the care of a family in Durham, he has fought back and shocked vets with his energy levels. Downton Abbey's Paul Copley, who played Mr Mason, selected Nelson for the award. He said: 'Three amazing stories about three remarkable pusscats, but Nelson is my choice. To survive all that he has and still be able to trust humans is quite something!' Companion: Alfie provided constant support to his own Cerian Munn in Southampton, Hampshire, when she underwent a life-saving kidney transplant . Tommy, owned by Mike Smith in London, leaped up and opened the lock on the family's front door when they came home from holiday and found themselves locked out . Doing what they can: Kipper (left), owned by Paul Greenwood of Buxton, Derbyshire, has been credited with bringing down his blood pressure. Meanwhile, Holly (right), owned by Ayshe Kadir of Loughton, Essex, started sleeping in Ayshe's bed when she noticed her owner was feeling ill with chronic headaches . The Most Caring prize went to Elias, the three-year-old pet of Army veteran Jack Dignam-Thomas. Suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder, Jack often falls into spells of disquiet, becoming introverted and disturbed. Elias, however, refuses to let him withdraw for long. Unlike most cats - more 'stand-offish' than dogs - Elias is always jumping around and demands attention. And according to Jack, it has been the key factor in helping him recover from the horror he experienced on the front line. Abandoned cats were also recognised in the awards. The award for Outstanding Rescue Cat went to Legz, a three-legged ginger tabby who is now the mascot of the Charlotte Despard pub in Archway, north London. People travel from all over to visit Legz and bring gifts like catnip and toys. Many pub-goers have even told Legz's owners Amber and Chris that they have been inspired to adopt a cat of their own. Judge Saffron Sprackling, the lead singer of techno-pop band Republica, said: 'Though Legz has lost one leg, it hasn't stopped him from befriending people and bringing together the community in his local pub with his personality and charm. 'He has also inspired people to rescue other cats as they can see he is a shining example that a rescue cat can bring happiness into people's lives! He is a true ambassador for rescue cats and Cats Protection!'","Five outstanding felines selected from hundreds nominated for their bravery, support and resilience .

"By . Tania Steere . Actress: Nappies and cots are bad for babies, while tampons can make you infertile, according to a motherhood manual by Alicia Silverstone . Nappies and cots are bad for babies, according to the latest celebrity motherhood manual. Written by actress Alicia Silverstone, the teen queen of the '90s who shot to fame in the hit 1995 romantic comedy Clueless, the book details bizarre parenting techniques that have been heavily criticised by experts. Among the offerings in The Kind Mama: A Simple Guide to Supercharged Fertility, a Radiant Pregnancy, a Sweeter Birth and a Healthier, More Beautiful Beginning are a recipe for a placenta smoothie and claims that tampons cause infertility because of the ‘potential pesticide residues from non-organic cotton’. Miss Silverstone also says that parents who force their children to sleep in a cot rather than  the family bed are guilty of neglect, and describes nappies as ‘pseudoscience’. And she declares she does not believe in . vaccinating babies because of friends whose children were ‘never the . same’ after receiving their jabs. The book is based on her experience of bringing up her son Bear Blu, now two. In it, the actress recommends a vegan . diet to stop meat, dairy, and processed foods tracking ‘toxic sludge’ through your uterus. She also claims the diet will ‘help prevent or . cure’ a whole host of problems including ‘PMS, insomnia, allergies, . breakouts, weight struggles, thyroid condition, lupus [and] multiple . sclerosis - while significantly lowering your risk of heart disease, . diabetes and cancer’. Miss Silverstone’s unusual approach . to parenting first came to light two years ago when she uploaded a video . of herself chewing her baby’s food before feeding him from her own . mouth, like a mother with a baby bird. But critics have dismissed her advice. In an article on the BabyCenter website, writer Carolyn Robertson said: ‘I don’t doubt the importance of eating well, be it during pregnancy, postpartum or just in general, and I’m sure Alicia has insight into the vegan lifestyle. ‘But... she shows a profound lack of . understanding, and perhaps even empathy, for mums who truly struggle to . conceive, to birth, to breastfeed, and to adjust to motherhood. Hit comedy: Miss Silverstone, the teen queen of the '90s, shot to fame in the hit 1995 romantic comedy Clueless . 'Alicia’s breezy prescription, which basically amounts to ""stop stressing and eat plants"", seems to seriously underestimate the reality of these struggles.’ Readers have also left critical reviews on the Amazon website. One reader wrote: ‘This book is filled with anti-science claims. Much of what it contains flies directly in the face of the evidence, and the author also goes so far as to make anti-vaccine claims. Children die as a result of not having been vaccinated. Please, publishers; stop printing this dangerous tripe.’ Another wrote: ‘I think it’s safe to say that if you’re looking for grown up, sensible, wise advice on fertility and mothering, look elsewhere.’","Alicia Silverstone details bizarre parenting techniques in The Kind Mama .

"By . Stephanie Linning . British diving star Tom Daley and his partner James Denny came agonisingly close to winning a gold for England at the Commonwealth Games today after a near-perfect final dive which left them settling for silver. As there were only four teams competing, there were only two medals awarded, and the pair looked like they were out of contention as they approached the edge of the board for their sixth and final dive. But the 20-year-old partners, who had just seven days to train together after deciding to enter the event last week, delivered a stunning routine, completing a complex four-and-a-half somersault. Unfortunately it was not enough to beat an Australian duo led by Matthew Mitcham, who narrowly beat the English pair by just 0.18 in the nail-biting final round. Scroll down for video .

"By . Mia De Graaf . It is one of the biggest markets in the tourist hot spot of Langowan, Indonesia. But  you won't want to face this on an empty stomach. From battered snake to spit-roasted bats, the smorgasbord of traditional delicacies on offer are not exactly appetising. Scroll down for video . Macabre: Spit-roasted bats are stacked on a plastic tables at Langowan Market in Sulawesi, Indonesia . Horrifying: Live dogs are sat in cages before being roasted with a blow torch on the muck-covered pavement . Grotesque: Tourists look in horror at lizards lying on their backs - cut open - with their insides on display . Live dogs sit in cages before they are roasted with blowtorches on the pavement. Three-metre-long snakes lie sprawled across the tables of blood-covered carcasses. Other delights include pickled rats, boar legs, and bite-size bats on sticks. And roasted lizards are cut open and displayed on their backs - with their insides on show. Casual: Locals casually survey the bloody carcasses of boars and bats, which are delicacies in the region . Snack: Bite-size black bats are sold on sticks to market-goers, which will make holiday-goers' stomachs turn . Controversy: The market is under constant surveillance by the government after selling endangered species . Graphic: Vegetables and spices are sold at the market but the hanging boar legs will stay in tourists' minds . The market, in the northern region of  Sulawesi, was marred by controversy in 1993 after government inspectors found sellers to be trading babirusa, an endangered type of wild pig. Despite numerous regulations put in place, it took years to eliminate the trade. However, the bizarre market has now become something of a tourist attraction - but few are willing to taste their way through the full menu. Not far from Langowan, the Tomohon Traditional Market also attracts a fair few horrified holidaymakers - and families planning their evening meal. All in a day's work: A market seller hacks away at a three-metre-long snake using three different knives . Portions: The segments are gruesomely displayed on the dirty, tiled worktops for customers to buy . Stash: One customer has stocked up on roasted rats for this evening's meal, piling them all into a basket . Grab-and-go: This man appears to have forgotten a bag - but seems not to mind carrying to wild boars' legs . Family day out: A child munches on a treat bought from the traditional market while his family select their meal . They casually survey the torched animals - lying frozen with a facial expression of horror - before selecting an entire snake or dog to serve up to the kids later. Travel blogger Raymond Walsh described the smell of the Tomohon market on his blog www.manonthelam.com. Mr Walsh said: 'In a word, appalling. There's something about the air that changes when there's that much death around. 'It hangs heavy and it made me queasy and light-headed at the same time... It's the first time I'd ever encountered anything like it.'","Tourists flock to Langowan market to try the bizarre traditional food .

"By . Rob Cooper . An artist made a life-sized replica of Michelangelo's artwork in the Sistine Chapel which is made entirely out of cake and contains 10,000 marshmallows. The replica of The Creation of Adam also features half a billion cake sprinkles and took 168 hours to complete. The 18ft 9ins by 9ft 2ins artwork - which was created to mark the 450th anniversary of Michelangelo's death tomorrow - has been dubbed 'The Baking of Adam'. Marshmallow art: The replica of the famous artwork The Creation of Adam, which features on the ceiling of Rome's Sistine Chapel, is made up of over 10,000 marshmallows . Intricate art: Michelle Wibowo puts the finishing touches to the picture made out of marshmallows to mark the 450th anniversary of Michelangelo's death . Cake Angels artist Michelle Wibowo . said: 'Britain is currently gripped by baking fever with a real emphasis . on unique designs and showmanship. 'When we learnt of Michelangelo's anniversary celebrations, we really wanted to join in. 'We decided to challenge the boundaries of cake design by immortalising his most heavenly creation in our own special way. 'We used our range of versatile and vibrant sprinkles, proving that even cake can become a fantastic art canvas.' The edible artwork is currently on display at London's St Pancras Church and is likely to be auctioned off for charity. It is one of London's most famous . ‘artistic churches', with its own gallery.

A 'glue' made out of icing sugar, butter and vanilla frosting was used to stick the sprinkles down. Although it is edible, it is unlikely that the cake artwork will ever be carved up and eaten. Mrs Wibowo, 35, . added: 'No celebration is complete without cake and we really hope that . Michelangelo would have given us his official seal of approval. Real thing: The original Creation of Adam artwork by Michelangelo which is on display in the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City . 'The . real difficulty was matching his exact scale and style but the . possibilities are endless when you have so many textures and colours to . choose from.' The original was commissioned for The Sistine Chapel by Pope Julius II and completed in 1512. Central to the ceiling decoration are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which The Creation of Adam is the best known. The famous painting has an iconic standing which some believe is equalled only by Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa portrait. Five years ago Canadian Joanna Lopianowski-Roberts, 44, unveiled a cross-stitch replica of the artwork.

"By . Afp . and Ap . The US is to speed up deliveries of missiles and surveillance drones to Iraq as the Baghdad government battles a resurgence of Al Qaeda linked militants. Joe Biden, the US vice president, spoke by phone with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki yesterday and 'expressed concern for those Iraqis who are suffering at the hands of terrorists,' a statement said. The Pentagon said Washington would accelerate the delivery of 100 more Hellfire missiles - which were due to be sent to Iraq in the next few months. Resurgence: A vehicle set on fire by tribesmen in Anbar, Iraq earlier this week. The US will accelerate a delivery of missiles and drones following renewed violence in the area . Colonel Steven Warren said an additional 10 ScanEagle surveillance drones would also be delivered. Hellfire missiles, originally designed as an anti-tank weapon, can be fired from helicopters and warplanes. ScanEagle drones are a low-cost three-meter aircraft capable of flying 24 hours. Officials reiterated today that American forces will not be sent in to assist military operations. Col Warren said Washington was working with Iraq to develop a 'holistic strategy to isolate al Qaeda-affiliated groups so the tribes working with the security forces can drive them out of the populated areas.' Instead, the United States will continue to provide intelligence to assist and advise the Iraqis at a 'ministerial level' through some 100 military personnel still based at the US Embassy in Baghdad. Violence: A road block in Anbar. US officials reiterated that American troops will not be sent in to assist the Baghdad government following the violence . The deliveries correspond to contracts already signed with Iraq. Some 75 Hellfire missiles were delivered to Baghdad in mid-December, US officials said. Since then, Iraq has seen a resurgence of fighting in the province of Anbar, which was a key insurgent stronghold for years following the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Mr al-Maliki has been urging residents of the city of Fallujah to expel Al Qaeda fighters or face all-out battle. Mr Biden lent his support to Iraq's fight against the local al-Qaida branch, adding he was concerned about those suffering from terrorism. Outbreak: A man stands by scores of empty shells. VP Joe Biden and Iraqi PM Nuri al-Maliki discussed the importance of working with Sunni leaders to isolate extremists . He spoke positively about recent co-operation between Iraq's military and tribal forces in Anbar, on the Syrian border, where Al Qaeda are among the most formidable trying to topple President Bashar Assad. 'Prime Minister Maliki affirmed the importance of working closely with Iraq's Sunni leaders and communities to isolate extremists,' the White House said. With the US worried about the sectarian nature of the growing violence, Mr Biden also spoke to Iraqi parliament Speaker Osama al-Nujaifi - a Sunni leader and frequent critic of Mr al-Maliki's Shiite-led government. The two discussed ways to continue co-operation between Sunni communities and the Shiite-led government and Mr al-Nujaifi said he was committed to fighting terrorism, the White House said. Devastation: Damaged buildings in Fallujah. The US government denied violence in the country was down to a withdrawal of American forces . US officials denied suggestions renewed violence was down to the withdrawal of American forces. Yesterday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said such violence in Iraq took place even when there were 150,000 US troops there. He said the US can assist, and will deliver more missiles and surveillance drones to Iraq this year, but insisted Iraq must take the lead. 'If members (of Congress) were suggesting that there should be American troops fighting and dying in Fallujah today, they should say so,' Mr Carney said. 'The president doesn't believe that.'","Deliveries of missiles and drones sped up following Al Qaeda resurgence .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A nine-year-old girl woke up to find both her parents dead after accidentally overdosing on a party drug called Dr Death. The child found the body of her mother, Suzanne Van Hagen, 34, and stepfather John Worton, 37, in separate rooms at home in Frankley, Worcestershire. She called 999 and told an operator 'blood was coming out of her dad's mouth'. Shock: Suzanne Van Hagen, 34, and John Worton, 37, were found dead at home by their nine-year-old daughter after accidentally taking an overdose of the Class A party drug called Dr Death or Pink Ecstasy . An inquest heard the child woke up shortly after 9am before seeing her stepfather's body lifeless in the living room. Post mortem results revealed fitness instructor Mr Worton had taken a lethal dose of paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA), also known as Dr Death or Pink Ecstasy. He had also taken recreational stimulant BZP and was drinking alcohol in the hours leading up to his death on February 8 last year, a pathologist told the court. An inquest into Ms Van Hagen's death will take place at a later date, but a previous post mortem examination showed she had also died from an accidental overdose of the Class A drug. Ambulance technician Adrian McCorkell said he was sent to the property at 9.53am after the child's distraught 999 call. Tragic: The child found her stepfather John Worton (pictured with an unidentified child) in the living room . Crime scene: Police and paramedics were called to the house in Frankley, Worcestershire, at 9.53am . Investigation: The child was put in the care of her grandparents as a post mortem examination was carried out . PMA, nicknamed Dr Death for its lethal side-effects, has claimed the lives of ten young people within a 60-mile radius of Manchester since January. The pills, which are available for as little as £3 each, are sometimes pink and shaped like Love Hearts sweets, or stamped with an ‘M’. The amphetamine is also known as pink ecstasy, but it contains a different active ingredient which makes it as much as five times stronger. PMA also takes longer to have an effect than ecstasy which means some users take more and unwittingly give themselves fatal overdoses. The youngest victim was 16-year-old Ellie Jones, who died after suffering breathing difficulties at a friend’s house in Warrington. PMA has also been linked to the deaths of eight revellers in Canada and there have been other deaths in Norway and Denmark. He said: 'I was greeted by a young girl. 'She stated that she was upset, she stated that her dad would be very upset if she let me in. 'I pushed the door open and passed her and since I got into the property, I asked her to show me where her mother was and she pointed into the direction of the doorway.' Mr McCorkell said he saw Ms Van Hagen in the bedroom. He was then shown to the living room where he found stepfather Mr Worton's body, which had been had been covered by a sheet. He said: 'I tried to get the girl to sit outside. 'She was reluctant to leave the property.' Police officers arrived and took care of the youngster before declaring the one-bedroomed maisonette a major crime scene. Mr Worton was pronounced dead at 10.10am by Mr McCorkell. Pathologist Alexander Kolar said: 'There was also evidence of alcohol and drugs of a therapeutic level.' Coroner Louise Hunt recorded Mr Worton's cause of death as 'mixed drug toxicity', principally PMA and Benzylpiperazine. Nearly 20 people have died after taking PMA, which can cost as little as £3 per pill. They include friends Chris Goodwin, 30, and Emma Johnson, 21, from Bolton, who took up to five times the lethal dose of the amphetamine at a party in 2012. Ms Van Hagen, who is thought to have worked as a nurse, was a former pupil at a top Catholic girls' school, St Paul's, in Birmingham.","Child, 9, woke to find mother dead in bedroom and stepfather dead on sofa .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Tragic: Horatio Chapple, 17, was mauled by a 39-stone polar bear as he slept during a trek through Norway . An Eton schoolboy was mauled to death by a polar bear while trekking through Norway after his team leaders used paper clips to secure the safety wire. Horatio Chapple, 17, was on a £2,500 adventure holiday to the remote Svalbard islands when a bear entered their camp, dragged him out of his tent, and killed him. Four others were severely injured before they managed to shoot the bear. Today, it emerged the trip-wire which should have alerted them when the bear approached had been secured by a paper clip. The alert system is designed to set off mines if an animal or intruder crosses the wire. But organisers of the British School Exploring Society trek in August 2011, which hosted 73 children, today admitted one of the wires was faulty and a team leader tried to fix it using the piece of stationery. The revelation comes at the start of an inquest into Horatio's death. A report published to coincide with the first day found the trip wires were inadequate, there should have been a bear watch, and the team should have been trained to use rifles. Sir David Steel, author of the report, blasted the 'inadequate' safety measures advised by Norwegian authorities, ruling that the incident 'was not unforeseeable'. He said teams should not be allowed to trek in the Arctic Circle without proper rifle training. And the team relied on an 'inconsistent' trip-wire system to alert them to the presence of polar bears - but it was inadequate as the warning would be too late. However, Richard Payne, from the BSES, defended the move, claiming it made the wire more effective. He said: 'The whole system is designed to give you an alert for you to wake up and do something about it. It's not a defence, it's not going to kill an intruder, it's going to alert you.' Mr Payne also admitted that the tripwires were not working perfectly and one of the leaders had adapted one using a paper clip to make the trigger-mechanism more sensitive. He continued: 'It was a paper clip and it did improve the system, and I had no reason to doubt that was the case.' Mr Payne said that the alternative system of carrying out bear watches had been put in place at the base camp after a recent sighting of a polar bear in the region, but nothing had been seen for the week that they had been held. Horatio's parents David and Olivia Chapple leave the Coroner following the first day of the inquest into their son's death. His mother said they presumed a trip so expensive would be safe . Danger: A report by Sir David Steel found the trip-wires used to sound alarms when a polar bear approaches did not work. The animal tore apart Horatio's tent, dragged him out and mauled him before chasing others . Horatio's parents Olivia, a GP, and David, a surgeon, appeared in court to say they presumed a trip so . expensive would be safe. Dr Olivia Chappel said she was . 'more anxious' than her husband and son and went through every detail in . the risk assessment to reassure herself about the group's protection. 'The trip was an expensive trip, I believed that they would have proper equipment,' she said. 'I thought Horatio would have a bear flare, I thought they would have things like bear spray. 'I . believed that the camp would be protected by trip wire. I was naive, I . had no idea how a camp site should be set up at that stage. 'I . didn't know there was the possibility that a trip wire may or may not . work. I didn't know they were so fraught with difficulty.' The team had set up camp on the Von Postbreen glacier and were sleeping in five tents when the 39-stone bear struck. Four . others were injured by the rampaging animal before team leader Michael . Reid, 27, managed to shoot the animal in the head with a rifle. Students Patrick Flinders, 16, and Scott Smith, 17, who were sharing a tent with Horatio, were seriously injured in the attack. Shot: After a scramble to find bullets for a rifle, one of the leaders shot the underweight 24-year-old bear . Describing . the incident, Sir David explained how the bear had approached through . the north-western side of the trip-wire system but none of the warning . mines had exploded. It then ripped open the tent on Horatio's side and dragged him out, causing potentially fatal head wounds. The rest of the camp woke up to screaming and shouts of 'bear!'. Horatio . appeared to try and sit up and stand but the bear reared up and slammed . into him, pushing him to the ground. He was not seen to move again, the . report says. There was then a shambolic scramble for guns, but no one in the team could work the rifles. 'In . the meantime,' he writes, '[one of the leaders] had got hold of the . rifle. He operated the bolt to seek to load and cock the rifle but it . failed to fire. He . operated the bolt on three or four more occasions without causing the . rifle to fire. On each occasion a bullet was ejected on to the ground . leaving the rifle empty. 'The bear then turned on [the leader] . and mauled him about the head. He dropped the gun. [The other leader] . had previously emerged from the rear of the leaders' tent. 'He was unable to pick up the gun as the bear was over it. 'He . realised that, having seen the attempts to shoot the bear fail, he . needed the spare bullets but was not immediately conscious of where they . were and shouted for help in finding them.' Unable to load a pen flare, he started throwing stones at the bear - which turned on him and mauled him too. The . bear continued to move between the bodies of Horatio and the two . leaders, while attacking other members of the group as they tried to . flee. Sir David described how some members of the camp had managed to escape to about 20 metres from the scene. He continued: '[The first leader] now managed to find one of the bullets that had been ejected, went back into the front of the tent to retrieve the rifle, loaded the rifle and, as the bear came back close to him, shot it dead.' The trip was an expensive trip, I believed that they would have proper equipment . - Horatio's mother, Dr Olivia Chapple . Sir David said the group then rallied and started to tend to the injured and calls were made for help from the local emergency services, although problems were experienced with the communications equipment, and the rescue team arrived by helicopter in a 'remarkable 35 minutes'. A post mortem on Horatio concluded that his death was caused by 'extensive soft tissue and bone injuries to the face and neck including destruction of the right facial artery'. An investigation found that it was 'a very old bear' in the region of 24 years old with 25 being the usual maximum. It was seriously underweight, about 250kg rather than the typical 400kg and it had 'heavily worn and painful teeth'. Sir David concluded by praising the group members for their bravery. He said: 'All members including not least Horatio demonstrated great courage in the face of the attack which started while the camp was asleep. 'Likewise considerable presence of mind was shown by the uninjured members of the party in the aftermath of the attack in tending to the wounded and calling for help.' The inquest continues.","Horatio Chapple, 17, mauled by polar bear as he slept near Arctic Circle .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A 23-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of killing his parents inside their leafy suburban home where neighbours heard gunshots, it is believed. Emergency services were called to reports of an attack at an address in affluent Solihull, West Midlands, at 5.15am today. The bodies of a 58-year-old man and a 50-year-old woman were found at the scene and a double murder inquiry was immediately launched. Probe: Emergency services were called to a house in Solihull at 5.15am today to find a man and a woman dead . West Midlands Police confirmed a 23-year-old man - who is believed to be their son - is in custody and was being questioned by officers this morning. Detective Inspector Martin Slevin said: 'The inquiry is in its early stages but police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths at this stage.' Part of Hermitage Road was cordoned off this morning and two large blue police tents were visible outside the property. Forensic officers in white suits could also be seen combing the road and house for possible clues. This afternoon, police widened their . cordon at the scene yesterday to seal off more of the road after . speculation part of the incident happened in the street outside the . family home. Shocked residents of the street - where . property values average £200,000 - said they believed the family . involved had children and were from Vietnam. Many claim to have heard gun shots. Jo Green, 20, said: 'My mum heard gunshots this morning.  They woke her up, scared. 'I used to walk down the road every day. Now I will think twice about walking down there. It's awful. 'He used to go to school with my brother. I cannot believe it.' A local man, who did not want to be named, added: 'He been arrested on suspicion of killing his mum and dad.' Arrest: A 23-year-old, a close relative of the victims, is in custody being questioned over the deaths . Investigation: Shocked residents in the leafy suburb said nothing like this ever happens in Solihull . One neighbour said: 'I believe a couple lived there with children and they seemed to be from a Far East background. 'They have live there for more than five years and kept themselves to themselves. 'I have not seen them a great deal of them. It is usually a very friendly street, which is also quiet and peaceful. 'This is all very mysterious. 'The first I knew of it, was early this morning when police had erected a tent outside the house.' Darryl Birch, 32, added: 'It concerns me a lot because this usually is a quiet area. 'Clearly, the investigation is very serious so it really worries me. It's dreadful. Police are working to identify the couple, who neighbours say are from Vietnam and live with their children . 'We have a lot of young families living here so it must be so terrible for them. 'They will, like myself, certainly think twice about going out at night around here now. 'It's very upsetting. 'My thoughts go out to the family concerned.' Theo Sotiriou, owner of Theo's Food opposite Hermitage Road, said: 'It is ironic that Solihull was actually voted the best to live in the UK not so long ago and now look.

"By . Daniel Martin . and Mark Duell . Foreign Office minister: Mark Simmonds is the MP for Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire . Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds quit yesterday, saying his salary and expenses of almost £120,000 were not enough to enable his children to live with him in London. The MP for Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire resigned with an attack on Parliamentary expenses - complaining that his income would not cover the cost of a Westminster flat that would accommodate his family. This is despite the fact that he received a ministerial salary of £89,435, an allowance of around £28,000 to rent a property in London and pays his wife Lizibeth up to £25,000 in her role as his office manager. Mr Simmonds said he will also leave Parliament at next year’s election because he hardly ever sees his family – two daughters aged 15 and 13 and a son aged 12 – because they live in his constituency. ‘There needs to be a system of allowances and support structures in place that supports MPs in their work, enables them to be normal people, which currently I believe is not the case,’ he said. ‘That’s the main reason I have resigned. The sacrifice to family life has become intolerable and the support for continuance of family life is not there... It is time we had a mature debate about this. ‘When I became an MP, the situation and support mechanisms were very different. You were able to have a family home in the constituency and a family home in London. That is no longer the case.’ Scroll down for video . Couple: Mr Simmonds received a ministerial salary of £89,435, an allowance of around £28,000 to rent a property in London and pays his wife Lizibeth (pictured together) up to £25,000 in her role as his office manager . Mr Simmonds, who says he stays in a hotel while in London, said he was not suggesting a return to the former expenses regime, which was widely abused, but believed that the pendulum had swung too far ‘the other way’ since the expenses scandal. Six months after becoming an MP, Mr Simmonds was said to have bought a four-bedroom terraced house (below, centre) in Putney, south-west London, for £650,000. Its mortgage interest was paid by taxpayers from 2001 and 2009, with the MP claiming more than £2,000 a month to cover the cost, reported the Daily Telegraph. Following the expenses scandal in 2009, a rule change meant Mr Simmonds could only now claim for renting in London - instead of claiming for the mortgage interest on his Putney home. Property records show he sold the house soon after for £1,187,500 in December 2010, which represented a rise of more than £500,000 on what he had paid almost a decade ago. An estate agents' description from 2010 which can still be viewed on property website Zoopla described the house as a ‘spacious and well-presented terraced family home’. The value of the house is now £1,742,500 - a further increase of more than £500,000. Asked if his expenses claims were in order under the old system, Mr Simmonds said: ‘I was one of those who was not involved at all.’ He claimed there were other MPs in a . similar position to him who were ‘reluctant’ to talk because they feared . being attacked as ‘greedy’. He . told Radio 4’s PM programme: ‘The previous expenses system was clearly . indefensible, abused and people rightly went to prison for fraudulent . behaviour.’ He said the reason for his departure was ‘a lifestyle choice’, adding: ‘It became intolerable – I rarely see my children.’ Criticising . the Parliamentary expenses regime, he said: ‘The allowances do not . stretch to renting a flat near Westminster large enough for my children, . so I stay in a hotel. I hate it.’ Mr Simmonds yesterday received the support of Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries, who said on Twitter that ‘only the wealthy’ can afford to have their family in Westminster. But Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said it was ‘ridiculous’ to say that almost £30,000 was not enough to find a decent family home in London. ‘The expenses system is more than generous, and hearing an MP complaining about it will do nothing to restore voters’ trust in their Westminster representatives,’ he said. ‘It’s no wonder so many people feel some politicians are out of touch.’ Mr Simmonds said he told Mr Cameron he wanted to go at the time of the reshuffle last month, but waited to announce it so he could tell his local association first. Quit: The MP resigned with an attack on Parliamentary expenses - complaining that his income would not cover the cost of a Westminster flat that would accommodate his family . He denied there was any link with Baroness Warsi’s decision to quit as a Foreign Office minister last week in a disagreement over Gaza policy, but his resignation has increased the sense of disarray at the heart of government as the Iraq crisis deepens. 'The sacrifice to family life has become intolerable and the support for continuance of family life is not there' Mark Simmonds . The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which oversees MPs’ expenses, said it was ‘awake to the impact on family life’ for MPs who have to live in two locations. ‘That is exactly why we provide more support to MPs with family or caring responsibilities,’ it said. Downing Street named Tory MP James Duddridge as the new minister for Africa.","Boston and Skegness MP resigns with attack on Parliamentary expenses .

"By . Mia De Graaf . They are the words guaranteed to induce dread in any supermarket shopper: 'Unexpected item in the bagging area. Please remove this item before continuing.' But the identity of the woman behind the robotic command at more than 10,000 self-service check outs across the UK has remained a mystery. Today, however, it has emerged that the dulcet tones belong to former EastEnders actress Helena Breck. Secret: The voice of self service checkouts that leaves shoppers across the UK embarrassed has been revealed as Helena Breck (left) who played the gritty role of Elizabeth Willmott-Brown in EastEnders in 1994 . It will surprise many as the well-spoken, non-confrontational warning seems worlds away from Albert Square. Ms Breck played Elizabeth Wilmott-Brown - the wife of James Wilmott-Brown who raped Phil Mitchell's girlfriend - in the BBC's flagship soap in 1994. But in 2008, she was snapped up by the National Cash Register (NCR) to record the fateful words that would be played at more than 10,000 of the nation's major supermarkets including Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's. Though other voices have been brought in since, Ms Breck's remains a favourite for stores. While the satnav industry is proud to promote its invisible stars, who include half-a-dozen mature British actresses with beautifully modulated voices, along with a few jokey contributors such as Brian Blessed and John Cleese, the NCR has refused to name Ms Breck. Speaking in 2010, Helen McInnes, spokesman for the American company, said: 'Her identity is a closely-guarded secret. Dynamic: Voiceover and television actress Ms Breck, whose non-confrontational voice emanates from check outs, has starred in gritty soaps including the hit ITV drama Crown Court in 1981 . 'We wouldn't want our competitors to take on the same voice.' Explaining the casting process, she said: 'The person has been chosen for having . a calming voice and an approachable manner.' In laboratory and shop . studies, customers 'overwhelmingly responded better to the female . voice'. Ms Breck, who last recorded a supermarket command in February 2009, said she tries her best to distance herself from the iconic role to concentrate on new, different work. She told MailOnline: 'It can impinge on being booked for other work as people think you're still attached to that. 'I still hear myself sometimes when I go into the supermarket but they have new voices now and I am doing other things.'","Helena Breck recorded famous phrase for National Cash Register in 2009 .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Payout: Serial rapist and killer David Mulcahy has won £515 for a damaged package sent from his cell where he is serving three life sentences . A sex killer who psyched himself up for rape and murder by listening to Michael Jackson’s Thriller has won £515 compensation - for a damaged parcel sent from jail. The taxpayer-funded payout for David Mulcahy has sparked outrage among victims' groups and MPs as he serves three life sentences. Mulcahy, 55, was jailed in 2001 and ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years for his four-year rape and murder spree with school friend John Duffy in the 1980s. The pair played Michael Jackson before their attacks and targeted victims around railway tracks, earning them the names Thriller Killers and Railway Rapists. But the convict has boasted to friends after winning hundreds of pounds in compensation from the Prison Service. In a letter from his cell at maximum-security Full Sutton prison, near York, Mulcahy said: 'My package was destroyed. 'The judge ruled that the prison had lied and they were totally responsible for any damage. I won £515.' After bragging about his payout, he wrote: 'Be warned, if you sue and win, there will be consequences and reprisals.' Mulcahy claims prison bosses now won’t let him send any post. This includes posting a model made for the Koestler Trust prison art awards, in which the prize for the winning prisoner is £100 and a certificate. In his rant at his prison bosses, he writes: 'They are now also refusing to answer my applications or request/complaint forms on this matter.' News of the compensation sparked fury, with critics saying it makes a mockery of British justice. It also sparked calls for the UK Government to end ridiculous claims by prisoners. Tory MP Philip Davies said: 'The fact that murderers and rapists such as Mr Mulcahy can be compensated for a damaged parcel goes to show how perverse our legal system has become. 'The only reason he is in prison is . because of his vile crimes, and for him to be able to pursue this claim . from his cell is utterly ridiculous. 'The compensation should be stripped . from him to benefit the families of his victims.' Behind bars: Mulcahy is jailed at maximum-security prison Full Sutton, near York, where he claims he has now been banned from sending post. The Prison Service blasted his compensation win as 'disappointing' Married father-of-four Mulcahy and Duffy went on what they called 'hunting parties' searching for lone women to rape and murder. Both martial arts enthusiasts, they often ambushed victims, binding, gagging and blindfolding them. They tossed a coin to decide who should be first to rape before murdering them. For years, Mulcahy, from Chalk Farm, north London, thought he had got away with it. But justice caught up with him. Duffy, sentenced to 30 years in 1988 for two killings and a rape, named his accomplice to a psychiatrist and gave evidence against his old school pal. At the Old Bailey in 2001, Mulcahy was given three life sentences for the murders of Alison Day, 19, Dutch schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer 15, and newlywed Anne Lock, 29. He was also convicted of seven rapes and five conspiracies to rape. Each rape carried a sentence of 24 years, while each conspiracy came with an 18-year term. Thriller Killers: John Duffy (left) and Mulcahy (right) worked together, cruising around looking for victims while singing Michael Jackson's hit song. They were both jailed in 2001 for their four-year rape and murder spree . Because of the horrific nature of the . crimes, Judge Michael Hyam ruled that Mulcahy had to serve at least 30 . years before he could even be considered for parole. The judge told him: 'These were acts of wickedness in which you descended to the depths of depravity.' In April, justice secretary Chris . Grayling ordered an urgent review into compensation claims by prisoners . after it emerged triple murderer Kevan Thakrar was paid . for damaged nail clippers. A Prison Service spokesman said: 'We defended this claim and are disappointed with the judge’s decision. 'The Government has no intention of paying compensation to prisoners when there is no good reason to do so and robustly defends all cases, as far as the evidence allows. 'The Justice Secretary has ordered a review of the system to ensure taxpayers’ money does not go to those who shouldn’t get it.' David Mulcahy and John Duffy were described chillingly as 'two bodies with one brain' for the way they hunted for women to rape and murder. Mulcahy and Duffy were drawn together as a pair of 11-year-olds on their first day of school in 1970. They were bullied at school and built an alliance, becoming obsessed with martial arts. Alison Day (left), 19, was visiting her fiancé when they pulled her off Hackney Wick platform, raped her twice, and strangled her with her blouse. Maartje Tamboezer (right), 15, was raped, killed and badly burned by the pair. She was cycling home from school in Horsley, Surrey, when they tripped up her bike with a fishing line . Just two years later, Mulcahy was suspended from Haverstock Hill Comprehensive, in Chalk Farm, north London, after killing a hedgehog by stamping on its head. Duffy stood by laughing. As they grew older, their larks became much more sinister. They planned and executed their murders together, down to the tissues Duffy carried in a matchbox to wipe away and burn forensic evidence. They went on what they called 'hunting parties' cruising along singing to Michael Jackson's hit song Thriller as they searched for lone women to rape and murder. Going out at night and weekends in search of prey, they would prolong their excitement by comparing victims after each attack. They tossed a coin to decide who should be first to rape before murdering them. Third . victim: Anne Lock, 29, pictured on her wedding day, disappeared after . leaving work at London Weekend Television in north London four weeks . after getting married. The pair raped and killed her in a nearby field . For their first attack, they had . planned a kidnap using false names and accents, kitting themselves out . with balaclavas, sticky tape and knives. It didn’t work because the pair became 'nervous', Duffy later said. Nevertheless, they had snatched a young woman off the street in the early hours and raped her in turn behind a wall. Then, . over the next four years, they embarked on a campaign that would claim . them a joint place in the criminal record books as history’s most . prolific rapists. Despite their silence pact, John Duffy gave evidence against Mulcahy when he was sentenced to 30 years for his crimes. At the Old Bailey in 2001, Mulcahy was . given three life sentences for the murders of Alison Day, 19, Dutch . schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer 15, and newlywed Anne Lock, 29. He was also convicted of seven rapes and five conspiracies to rape.","David Mulcahy, 55, is serving three life sentences for rape and murder spree .

'The jet-stream looks set to dive southwards into Ireland and then across the UK this weekend, and thus it’s likely to become cooler and wetter in the north on Saturday, and then in the south on Sunday' Brendan Jones, MetDesk forecast manager . 'When the jet-stream is diverted to the north of the UK, the low pressure systems are diverted with it. This often allows areas of high pressure to build across the UK and high pressure often results in dry, sunny conditions with light winds. ‘The current position of the jet-stream is displayed on the graphic as areas of pink shading, showing how it is passing well to the north of the UK and allowing high pressure to build over much of northern Europe. ‘The jet-stream looks set to dive southwards into Ireland and then across the UK this weekend, and thus it’s likely to become cooler and wetter in the North on Saturday, and then in the South on Sunday. ‘We’re then likely to see the jet-stream closer to the UK through next week compared with recently, and thus there’ll be a greater potential for showers and breezier weather.’ This summer’s heatwave has boosted the happiness of Britons by 25 per cent, research claimed today.

"By . Mark Duell . For many of us, a car journey means one inevitable thing – at some point you’ll have a row with the other occupants. And it seems that just about anything can set us off. Now a survey has revealed the biggest causes of in-car friction and, perhaps unsurprisingly, rows over which route to take top the list. Driving too fast, not asking for directions when lost and children being too noisy are next on the list, compiled by the AA and Populus. Scroll down for video . Argument: A survey has revealed the biggest causes of in-car friction and, perhaps unsurprisingly, rows over which route to take top the list (file picture) The survey, based on responses from more than 23,000 AA members, found that two in three people argue in the car, with those aged 18 to 24 more likely to row than the over-65s. People in Northern Ireland get hottest under the collar while in the car, with the least-argumentative car occupants being those from south-west England. Disputes about knowing the best route were the top cause of argument for all age groups, with driving too fast being the second-biggest cause for all but the 35-44s who were more concerned about noisy children. AA president Edmund King said: ‘Long journeys often get fraught at times. The key thing is taking time to prepare well for the journey which should help keep arguments at bay.’ Rows on the road: Congestion on the M3 motorway .","Not asking for directions is also on list compiled by the AA and Populus .

The iconic bird has seen its population tumble in recent decades, with some estimates putting numbers at fewer than 4,000 in Britain. But this summer’s excellent breeding rates are raising hopes that the barn owls have turned a corner and the population will climb. John Dellow, of Berkshire monitoring group the Newbury Ornithological Society, said: ‘What a difference a year makes. ‘There was a good year in 2012 when surveys concluded that 72 barn owl chicks fledged from the boxes that were monitored by our group. ‘But this was followed by a disastrous year in 2013 when no breeding was found at all, even though the number of boxes was approximately unchanged at 120.’ He added: ‘Morale in the group was at an all-time low and there were mutterings that it would take a decade for the barn owl population to recover. ‘But the 2013-14 winter was exceptionally mild and this enabled short-tailed voles, one of their main prey, to start breeding exceptionally early. ‘At the time of writing, 118 chicks had been found, by far a record for the group... It is clear we are seeing a remarkable exhibition of the resilience of nature.’ Barn owls have also been breeding in record numbers in the Dedham Vale and Stour Valley in Suffolk following a disastrous year for them last year. Today: Low cloud and mist in some eastern areas at first. Slowly brightening up, although staying locally dull and cool on some eastern coasts into the afternoon. Elsewhere, generally dry with sunny periods but isolated afternoon showers in the east. Warm. Tonight: Any showers in the east dying away this evening, then generally dry with clear periods overnight. Low cloud again returning to some eastern areas and also affecting some western coasts. Tuesday: Early cloud breaking up with most places having a dry day with sunny periods and occasional cloudier spells. A few rogue showers may develop in the north and west. Warm. Wednesday to Friday: Plenty of dry and fine weather with sunny periods. Some showers in the south and west from Thursday these locally heavy and thundery. Very warm, locally hot in the south. Friday to Sunday: There is likely to be plenty of fine and dry weather around, especially across the northern half of the UK. More showery conditions generally affecting southern parts, which potentially could be heavy and thundery at times. Temperatures remaining warm or very warm for many across the UK and perhaps locally hot in places. Sea breezes could keep some coastal parts a little fresher though. Monday, July 28 to Sunday, August 3, 2014: Currently there are signs of Atlantic frontal systems moving in from the west, bringing spells of more persistent rain, mainly to northwestern parts, interspersed with brighter, but showery conditions. Whilst probably drier and warmer in the south. Temperatures also gradually returning to near or a little above normal. Monday, August 4 to Monday, August 18, 2014: At the start of the period, the favoured scenario is for northern and western parts to be affected by spells of rain at times whilst southern, eastern and central regions have the best chance of more prolonged fine weather, though even here some rain or showers are possible. With time, it looks likely that all areas will turn generally more unsettled although there will still be some drier and brighter spells. Despite this, there is a signal for temperatures remaining warm, with some muggy nights to come. Towards the end of the period, the weather looks likely to become more settled again with some dry, fine and sunny conditions. It also looks likely to be warm, especially in the north and east.

"By . Mark Duell . A wife watched in horror as her race driver husband was killed in a crash at one of Britain’s most famous circuits. Denis Welch, 69, a businessman from Dilhorne, Staffordshire, died when he lost control of a 1960 Lotus 18 during a race for pre-1966 Grand Prix cars at Silverstone in Northamptonshire yesterday. He was well known on the classic racing circuit both as a driver and through his car parts business empire, based at Yoxall, near Lichfield. 'Died doing what he loved': Denis Welch, 69, a businessman from Staffordshire, was killed when he lost control of a 1960 Lotus 18 during a race for pre-1966 Grand Prix cars at Silverstone in Northamptonshire . Race driver: Mr Welch was well known on the classic racing circuit both as a driver and through his car parts business empire, based at Yoxall, near Lichfield, Staffordshire . Mr Welch’s son, Jeremy, said his 70-year-old mother Tina had gone to watch the race. He added that he was comforted by the knowledge his father ‘died doing what he loved’. He said: ‘My mum is devastated because her whole life was her partner and motor racing. Her world’s been turned upside down. ‘They were married for 45 years and were both so passionate about classic car racing. He’d been driving for a very long time so he was fully aware of the risks. ‘Accidents happen and it’s very unfortunate. The car turned upside down and he died almost immediately. The one consoling fact was that it was very swift and he died doing what he loved.’ Trophy: Essex-born Mr Welch began in business by buying a petrol station, but took time out to start a family .

He started racing in 1965 and although he took it seriously, never really had ambitions to race professionally.’ Police and the Motor Sports Association, the UK official motor sport governing body, is conducting a full investigation into his death.","Denis Welch lost control of 1960 Lotus 18 in Northamptonshire yesterday .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Ultimo founders Michelle and Michael Mone negotiated to share personal number plates, computer passwords and a collection of small properties in a bitter divorce settlement, it has emerged. But court documents reveal the pair made a deal not to sell their Glasgow mansion for less than £2.1million and it is still on the market, reports claim. The couple, who created the lingerie brand together in 1996, split in 2011 after Michael, 46, allegedly had an affair with a bra designer. Deal: Court documents reveal Michelle and Michael Mone spent their settlement dividing secret passwords and number plates but agreed to put their entire mansion - and all its possessions - on the market for £2.1m . Venture: The couple founded MJM International, which owns Ultimo, in 1996 after marrying in 1992 . Michelle, 42, raged publicly at her husband for refusing to sell her their baby grand piano and part of their luxurious home. Unable to reach an agreement, they had to put the lot up for sale. The couple demolished the original building, and built 'Telperion', a five-bedroom home, six times the size of the average British house. It is located in Thorntonhall, a pretty village regarded as one of the most desirable places to live in Scotland. It is also being offered with all the furniture - estimated to have cost the couple £600,000 - which will be separately negotiated. Contentious: The pair fought over the luxurious mansion they built together in Thorntonhall, Glasgow . Business: After years of bitter divorce deals, Michelle eventually bought Michael out of their business . The property boasts a vestibule and reception room, drawing room, dining room, dining kitchen, family room, cinema and five bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms. There is a state-of-the-art kitchen designed by the acclaimed Clive Christian and featuring beautifully made Edwardian style units and four dishwashers. But according to The Scottish Sun on Sunday, they settled on dividing up other items including their fleet of four personalised cars and their own secret passwords used in the business. Now linked to cricketer Shane Warne and businessman Karl French, Michelle has been embroiled in controversy over student halls being built next to the home where she now lives with her three children. She paid £780,700 for the three-bedroom duplex and had extensive works done before moving into it last August. The property has a magnificent reception hall and stairway and is now worth more than £1 million. However, the 42-year-old businesswoman was aghast at the thought of 'anti-social' Strathclyde University students becoming her neighbours or attending events at the house.","Couple who founded Ultimo in 1996 split passwords and number plates .

"By . Rebecca Camber . A BBC reporter assaulted by Rolf Harris believes the shamed entertainer may have claimed many more victims. Letitia Fitzpatrick, who was abused by her childhood hero in front of young children, says the revelations at his trial may be only ‘the tip of the iceberg’. She was 29 when she interviewed him after he led an art class in Belfast in 1991 for youngsters aged five to 12. Scroll down for video . Letitia Fitzpatrick, who was abused by her childhood hero in front of young children, says the revelations at his trial may be only 'the tip of the iceberg' ‘He told me he had a grown-up daughter and I said I was a mother with two children aged two and one,’ the 52-year-old recalled. ‘We went outside and children were playing around us. ‘He was standing there with me and my cameraman went to pack up his gear. 'I was saying thank you very much for the interview, suddenly he grabbed my face with both hands, pulling me towards him and forced his tongue into my mouth. ‘Then he turned on his heel and walked away as if nothing had happened. I felt disgusted and dirty. I thought it was really perverted. I went back to the BBC and I didn’t mention it to anyone. I wanted to forget about it.’ Facing jail: Despite his conviction for a string of child sex offences today Rolf Harris' wife Alwen, left, and daughter Bindi, right, held hands with him as he walked out of Southwark Crown Court . Miss Fitzpatrick said the incident destroyed her image of a man she considered to epitomise family entertainment. She added: ‘Growing up he was like a favourite uncle to me, he always had that avuncular appeal. 'Jimmy Savile was weird, some people found him creepy, while Rolf Harris did not appear to be. ‘What he did was opportunistic and predatory and random – he did not care that I was a journalist. 'The more I thought about it, the more I thought there is no way it was a one off.’ Miss Fitzpatrick did not contact police because she did not know it was an offence and doubted whether she would be believed. It was not until she read that Harris had been arrested that she decided to report the matter to the police. ‘I can imagine how difficult it was for these women to make such serious allegations against Harris,’ she said. Lies: Harris had claimed that he was the victim of malicious lies, and was being punished for his infidelity, but the jury believed the women who said he abused them . Scrum: Harris scrambles into a waiting limousine and will return to court on Friday where he will be sentenced for his sex crimes . ‘I wanted to support them because I thought it was the right thing to do.’ Miss Fitzpatrick blasted Harris’s lawyers yesterday for attempting to gag the media after his arrest, saying she would not have come forward had she not heard of the other cases. ‘It’s reprehensible. I found it shocking,’ she added. ‘Some of his behaviour in court has been totally bizarre when he sang and performed. 'I just felt it must have been harrowing for his victims giving evidence against him and then to see him behaving like that, it appears he wasn’t taking them seriously. It’s astonishingly arrogant. ‘It shows contempt for the judicial process and denial that he has done anything wrong. I just found it horrifying. ‘What happened to me was not as serious as what a lot of other people suffered, but he thought he could do that to me with impunity.’","Letitia Fitzpatrick was 29 when she interviewed him after in Belfast in 1991 .

"By . Martin Robinson . and Mia De Graaf . and Rebecca Camber . Rolf Harris admitted in court yesterday that he sexually admired his daughter’s friend when she was just 13. The 84-year-old made the extraordinary statement as he conceded he is ‘pretty good at disguising the dark side’ of his character. In a series of sensational exchanges, Southwark Crown Court heard how he thought his daughter Bindi’s young friend had a ‘great body’ when he saw her in a bikini on holiday in Hawaii in 1978. Damaging: Sasha Wass QC (left) asked Rolf Harris (left) if the affair with his victim was 'no-frills sex' to which he said 'it was' before he admitted he found her attractive at 13 . The married father of one, who was then 46, recalled how he had complimented the schoolgirl – who was ‘like a daughter’ to him. Prosecutor . Sasha Wass, QC, asked him: ‘What you were saying is, “You have got a . great body”, weren’t you?’ He replied: ‘I suppose so.’ The prosecutor continued: ‘When she was 13?’ Quietly, he answered: ‘Yes’ The . prosecutor added: ‘You made it plain you did admire her body and you . admired it sexually, that’s what that is.’ Harris answered: ‘It did not . compute to that in my mind.’ Prosecution QC Sasha Wass (SW) today put it to Rolf Harris (RH) compliments he made to a girl about her bikini was actually a comment on her body, and suggested he was admiring her sexually. Here is the exchange in full: . SW: 'Do you accept that when a man tells a woman or a girl that they look lovely in a bikini, they are not actually admiring the clothing, but they are admiring the person's body?' RH: 'Possibly.' SW: 'What you were saying to (the alleged victim) is ""You have got a great body"".' RH: 'I suppose so.' SW: 'When she was 13?' RH: 'Yes.' SW: 'And you made it plain to (the alleged victim) on that holiday that you did admire her, admire her body?' RH: 'On one occasion, possibly.' SW: 'And you admired her sexually, that's what that is.' RH: 'It did not compute to that in my mind ... in hindsight, I suppose it is.' SW: 'It seems from where we are going from your answers to the questions that you admired (the alleged victim's) body sexually during that holiday.' RH: 'It's possible, yes.' SW: 'And, of course, once we work out that you did see (the alleged victim) in a sexual light during that holiday, everything that (she) says becomes realistic, doesn't it?' RH: 'Not as far as I'm concerned, because it never happened.' Miss Wass said: ‘It was a sexual remark.’ Harris said: ‘In hindsight, I  suppose it was.’ Miss . Wass continued to press him, adding: ‘In hindsight, you must have . admired her body sexually during that holiday?’ Harris muttered: ‘It’s . possible, yes.’ The . prosecutor claimed the holiday marked the start of a 16-year grooming . campaign by the children’s TV presenter, which would turn the shy . 13-year-old girl into an alcoholic, compliant ‘toy’ whom Harris could . ‘play with’ whenever he wanted. During . cross-examination, she told him: ‘You are pretty good, aren’t you, at . disguising that dark side of your character?’ Harris replied: ‘Yes.’ Miss . Wass told jurors: ‘The issue is how dark that dark side actually is. This was not a consensual relationship, this was child abuse, grooming, . and you effectively psychologically dominated that girl into womanhood.’ She continued: ‘You have . had to admit that the private Rolf Harris had a sexual involvement with . your daughter’s friend?’ Harris replied: ‘Yes.’ Miss . Wass added: ‘So close to Bindi that she was almost like Bindi’s sister – . this would have made her your daughter.’ Harris said: ‘Yes.’ Yesterday . the court heard how the entertainer’s daughter flew into a rage when . her friend told her of her father’s betrayal, and smashed up paintings . he had given her in around 1997. Harris . said a ‘huge row’ had erupted, adding: ‘I believe she told Bindi – I . was away in Australia – and I believe she had smashed a couple of . paintings that I had given her, she was furious.’ But the star insisted . that he was ‘targeted’ by her flirtatious friend who seduced him when . she was 18 and ‘instigated all the moves’. He said the pair had a relationship based on ‘a mutual feeling of warmth and affection’. Asking . him to explain a letter of apology he later wrote to the alleged . victim’s father after she had told her family of the alleged abuse, Miss . Wass accused Harris of thinking he was ‘untouchable’. Speaking in a low voice, Harris told jurors: ‘That’s not what I intended at all.’ He . denied getting ‘a thrill’ out of sexually assaulting the victim in . Bindi’s presence, including one occasion when he allegedly performed a . sex act on the girl when she was 15 as Bindi, then 16, slept a few feet . away. He insisted that it would be ‘physically not possible’ to look at his daughter and perform the act. The . Australian told jurors that he ‘laughed in disbelief’ when the alleged . victim confronted him in 1997 at the age of 31. He claimed the only . reason the woman was ‘emotionally dead’ and ‘damaged’ was because she . ‘felt scorned’ when their relationship fizzled out and he later began an . affair with his 35-year-old housekeeper. The entertainer, who faced his second day in the witness box today, revealed his daughter was 'furious' Harris is accused of attacking three other girls aged seven to 19 between 1968 and 1986. Yesterday . Miss Wass accused him of adopting a ‘technique’ of ‘a friendly hug, . disguised as sexual molestation’ in all the assaults. She . added: ‘There are a series of events in this case where you have taken . advantage of the fact that you are a well-loved children’s entertainer.’ She . also accused him of being aware of child abuse tactics having taken . part in an NSPCC campaign to raise awareness of the dangers. But Harris . told the court his accusers had invented the same lie, saying: ‘They are . all making it up’. Yesterday his friend pantomime producer Paul . Elliott, dubbed the ‘king of pantomime’, said Harris was ‘warm, cuddly . and jolly’ and he had never been concerned about his behaviour around . children. Family: Veteran entertainer Rolf Harris arrives at Southwark Crown court with daughter Bindi (left), wife Alwen and niece Jenny (right), where he admitted it was 'possible' he sexually admired a 13-year-old in a bikini . Dressed in a dark blue suit, Harris had shuffled into court slowly  yesterday and spoke in mostlty hushed tones. It was in marked contrast to his ‘polished performance’ a day  earlier, which saw the entertainer bursting into song. Miss . Wass said he had ‘delighted’ jurors, but warned: ‘This case as you know . is not a talent show, is it? This case is taking place to decide . whether underneath your friendly and loveable exterior there is a darker . side lurking. ‘Even on your own account, the private Rolf Harris was very different from the public Rolf Harris.’ Harris replied: ‘I suppose so.’ He denies 12 counts of indecent assault. The trial continues. Evidence:  Rolf Harris as he was shown a photo of one of the complainants in a bikini during her holiday in the 1970s. The star admitted he had 'sexually admired' her but denied he abused her . Rolf Harris admitted he goes home alone every night - despite walking into court arm-in-arm with his wife and daughter. It came after the 84-year-old entertainer told Southwark Crown Court his daughter Bindi 'furiously' smashed up paintings he had given her on learning about the affair with her friend. Sasha Wass QC said: 'You have been coming to court everyday, walking . slowly into court with Bindi on one arm and your wife on the other', and . asked if they travelled home together. Harris said 'no'. Show of support: Rolf Harris (pictured last Wednesday walking hand-in-hand with daughter Bindi, left, and wife Alwen, right) admitted he goes home alone every night from Southwark Crown Court . Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC accused Harris of coming in with his faimly (pictured yesterday) 'for the cameras' Ms Wass asked: 'So it's just for the cameras is it? Coming in with them?' 'It's to show support,' he said. Ms Wass asked Harris if he had paid legal fees for his daughter Bindi and wife Alwen, who were accompanied by solicitors when they attended police interviews. 'It may have been arranged through my accountant, I didn't know about it,' he said. His revelation came after Harris told the court Bindi (left, today) was 'furious' when she learned of the affair . The entertainer told the court that his alleged victim had told Bindi about their affair while he was away in Australia. 'When I came back she had smashed a couple of paintings that I had given her, she was furious.' Asking Harris if he had discussed the case with his daughter, Ms Wass asked if he had 'put her up' to giving certain evidence, to which he replied: 'No, no discussions at all.' Harris was released from the witness box while friend and pantomime producer Paul Elliott gave evidence. The case was adjourned to 10am tomorrow, when Harris will continue to be cross-examined.

"By . Rebecca Camber . Disgraced: Rolf Harris, with this trademark spectacles removed for this police-issue photo . He was one of our best-loved entertainers, charming the nation’s families and the Queen alike over five decades. Yet all the while Rolf Harris was hiding behind his wholesome image as children’s TV presenter, musician and artist to sexually prey on dozens of women and girls as young as seven. Yesterday the 84-year-old was facing the rest of his life behind bars after a jury convicted him of being a predatory paedophile. Prosecutors say Harris believed his fame placed him above the law – he acted ‘in plain sight and without fear of consequences’. His victims included his daughter’s 13-year-old friend. After his eight-week trial ended yesterday, it can be revealed that: . The Australian-born star betrayed little emotion as he was convicted of all 12 counts of indecent assault relating to four girls aged seven to 19. He sat motionless, staring straight ahead as the unanimous verdicts were returned after 30 hours of deliberations following the trial at Southwark Crown Court in South London. He left the courtroom without a word, glancing at his wife of 56 years with his eyebrows raised as he gave her a half-hearted wave. Scroll down for video . Veteran entertainer Rolf Harris leaves Southwark Crown Court, with his wife Alwen and daughter Bindi (right), after being found guilty of 12 sex charges involving four women . Alwen Hughes, 82, battled to maintain her composure, with only the muscles in her jaw working furiously and betraying her inner turmoil. His daughter Bindi Nicholls, 50, who stood by her father despite his abuse of her best friend leaving her suicidal at one point, tightly grasped her aunt Jenny’s arm for support, blinking back tears. Later, he linked arms with his wife, daughter and niece as they faced the cameras outside, remaining silent as he was asked whether he would apologise to his victims. Last night his daughter’s best friend said: ‘I’m very relieved, that’s all I’m prepared to say.’ Another victim, BBC reporter Letitia Fitzpatrick, said: ‘I’m so relieved for all the women who came forward and all of those who haven’t, to see him being exposed for what he is – a predatory paedophile, an opportunistic sexual predator.’ Harris could face years behind bars as three of the 12 counts carry a possible ten-year sentence. Releasing him on unconditional bail, Mr Justice Sweeney warned him: ‘Given the conviction on all 12 counts it is inevitable that the type of sentence that is upmost in the court’s mind is a custodial sentence, and he must understand that.’ During his trial, the court heard that Harris had hidden the dark side of his ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ personality. Carefully concealing the ‘demon lurking beneath his charming exterior’ he used his fame to beguile innocent and impressionable young fans mesmerised by his talent. He groomed his daughter’s best friend for 16 years, assaulting her while Bindi, then 16, slept just yards away. The years of abuse transformed the girl from a care-free child from a prosperous middle-class family to an alcoholic teenager who spiralled into depression and despair. Rolf Harris looks over at his family just as he is about to leave the dock at Southwark Crown Court today . Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC described his victim, now 49, as a ‘damaged and emotionally dead creature’, adding: ‘He used her for his sexual gratification like she was a blow-up doll.’ Throughout the case, Harris maintained it was she who had seduced him at the age of 18 when he was 53. But the star’s damning letter – written to her father in 1997 begging for forgiveness – told a different story. His other victims included a seven-year-old autograph hunter he ‘aggressively fondled’ after performing his hit Two Little Boys in 1969. During his trial, the court heard that Harris had hidden the dark side of his ¿Jekyll and Hyde¿ personality . He also molested a 14-year-old waitress during filming of a celebrity knockout show in Cambridge in 1978 and 15-year-old child actress Tonya Lee during a youth theatre tour in 1986. A further six women gave evidence as supporting witnesses for the prosecution about the cartoonist dubbed ‘the Octopus’ in TV circles for his wandering hands. Seven other victims – including a celebrity who was molested as she interviewed him live on TV – gave statements but were not called as witnesses. He is the second person to be convicted under Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree probe, launched in the wake of the Savile scandal. PR guru Max Clifford was caged for eight years in May for indecently assaulting four victims, the youngest aged 15. Yesterday, Detective Chief Inspector Mick Orchard said: ‘He committed many offences in plain sight of people as he thought his celebrity status placed him above the law.’ Jenny Hopkins, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor in London, said: ‘Each victim, unknown to the others, described a similar pattern of behaviour; that of a man acting without fear of the consequences.’ Harris was bailed until Friday when he will be sentenced. His only child hoped to inherit £11million. But with the prospect of lengthy and expensive legal battles ahead as victims file damages claims, and his paintings plummeting in value, much of Rolf Harris’s fortune could be wiped out. Recent published accounts show that his millions are tied up in a network of companies and family trusts, two of which were set up in 2012 – months before he faced police investigation. His oldest company, Rolf Harris Enterprises, was launched in 1963. Rolf Harris with his portrait of Queen Elizabeth II taken in 2006. His paintings are now plummeting in value . It has £1.13million in the bank and £2.5million in assets, with directors including his brother Bruce Harris, wife Alwen, niece Jennifer Harris and daughter Bindi Nicholls. A separate company set up in January 2012 called Rhel Holdings lists Harris and his wife as shareholders and Bruce, Alwen and Jenny Harris as directors. Figures show it contains profits of £1,654,379 and capital of £2,080,528 from Rolf Harris Enterprises. A third company, RHE Investments – also set up in 2012 – is a family trust which controls £1.6million in cash and £5.3million in fixed assets and investments. But Southwark Crown Court heard Bindi was anxious that her future should be secured. She wrote an email to her parents on July 25, 2012 – before his arrest – referring to an inheritance of ‘around £11million’. She said: ‘I understand that I am sole inheritor of your estate – is this true? If I am, then I feel you both have to sit down and discuss your feelings or beliefs about this inheritance. ‘If I am going to inherit this money, I need to be part of the running of the company as it will be my responsibility in the future? It’s a massive responsibility that I need to understand and feel empowered by and part of... ‘Please imagine how it is for me... figures in millions are being talked about willy-nilly. ‘It’s like being told that you might be winning the lottery at some point and you get excited and dream about the things you “could” do.’","The 84-year-old entertainer faces the rest of his life behind bars .

"By . Sam Marsden . and Rebecca Camber . A prominent Tory MP was arrested and cautioned by police for assaulting his partner during a row, it has emerged. Former shadow police minister David Ruffley, 52, admitted domestic violence after a night in the cells. A source told the Daily Mail he flew into a rage and ordered his then-girlfriend Wendy Drew to move out of his luxury flat in London after the argument in March. Held: The Cambridge-educated politician, pictured after becoming an MP for Bury St Edmunds in 2005, was arrested and taken to the cells . Terrified, Mrs Drew rang the police while Mr Ruffley went to find the concierge to have her thrown out of the building. She was still on the phone when the MP returned, and the 999 call handler heard him shouting at her, the source said. Officers arrived at the flat in Pimlico, a stone’s throw from Westminster, and arrested Mr Ruffley on suspicion of assaulting Mrs Drew, 56, a portrait and landscape artist. Mr Ruffley was taken to a police station and held in the cells for several hours before accepting a caution in the early hours of the morning. Cambridge-educated Mr Ruffley was a solicitor and an adviser to Tory Cabinet minister Ken Clarke, before he was elected as MP for Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk in 1997. He was a rising star in the party and had served as one of David Cameron’s shadow ministers when he narrowly cheated death after falling under a Gatwick Express train at London’s Victoria station in June 2010. He escaped with only cuts and bruises after he missed the live rail and the train passed over him. At the time the incident was described as a failed suicide attempt after he was exposed during the MPs’ expenses scandal for claiming £1,674 for a sofa and £2,175 for a 46in high-definition television. Mr Ruffley had been depressed, lost weight and was smoking and drinking too much, friends said. But he has since appeared to have turned his life around. Recalling events at Victoria station, Mr Ruffley told the Mail last year: ‘It was an accident. I certainly had a bout of depression. ‘I was incredibly lucky, to say the least. I now cherish every day.’ Today he is a member of the Treasury Select Committee, and was last year reselected to fight his seat at the General Election. He also told the Mail: ‘I feel healthier than I ever have in my life. My self-belief is higher than ever. In terms of my political career, many of my close friends are convinced the best is yet to come.’ But the revelation that he assaulted his former partner will raise new questions about his state of mind. The MP had previously been linked with a number  of attractive women, including writer and socialite Petronella Wyatt, but he has  never married. He met Irish-born Mrs Drew, a widow whose late husband was a wealthy property developer, in October 2010, four months after the incident at Victoria station. Speaking last year, Mr Ruffley said she had made a ‘positive difference’ to his life. Contacted at her home in Mr Ruffley’s constituency, Mrs Drew declined to comment on the incident that resulted in the MP being arrested and cautioned. She said: ‘I split up from David in March and am no longer in contact with him.’ But a close friend said: ‘She was scared of him. I think she stayed for fear of what he might do if she left. He treated her so badly. ‘We hated his hold over her. Everyone is delighted she has finally made the break.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘On Saturday, March 15 at approximately 8.50pm police attended an address in Marsham Court, Pimlico, and arrested a 52-year-old man on suspicion of common assault. ‘The man was taken to a central London police station. He has since accepted a caution for common assault.’ Mr Ruffley could not be reached for comment yesterday. A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘This matter was investigated by the police and dealt with by them at the time.’","David Ruffley, 52,  flew into a rage with his then girlfriend Wendy Drew .

"By . Tom Kelly . and Rebecca Camber . Rolf Harris told the furious brother of a woman he allegedly sexually assaulted from the age of 13 that ‘It takes two to tango’, a court heard yesterday. A successful businessman, the brother rang the entertainer and threatened to beat him up over the alleged 16 years of abuse, which left his sister battling alcoholism and close to death. Southwark Crown Court heard how the 31-year-old broke down and confessed to her parents and siblings, saying ‘I’ve been abused all my life’ after turning up drunk to a family Sunday lunch. Scroll down for video . Trial: Rolf Harris pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court today with his daughter Bindi, left, and his niece Jenny, right . Her brother told jurors that he took . his sister aside and asked about her drinking. ‘That’s when she confided . to me that she’d been sexually abused,’ he said. ‘I was angry, I felt guilty. Apart from the deterioration in her condition, I didn’t understand why she was behaving like that and why she was doing that to herself.’ Her brother immediately phoned Harris. ‘I asked him to not contact my sister any more and I threatened physical violence,’ he said. ‘I told him why I was angry. ‘I said “You have abused my sister”, ‘He said, “It takes two to tango”. ‘The conversation didn’t go on much after that.’ Yesterday the parents of the alleged victim spoke of their shock and ‘disgust’ over the accusations. They told the court they felt betrayed by a ‘trusted’ family friend who allegedly assaulted their daughter right under their noses. Jurors were told that Harris, 84, would turn up at the teenager’s home asking to see her and disappear upstairs with her alone for up to an hour. Her parents said they had ‘no concerns’ because his daughter Bindi had been a friend of their daughter for many years. Arrival: Harris adjusts his jacket as he arrives for the latest day of his indecent assault trial . The mother said Harris would come round to see her daughter. ‘I remember it once certainly. It was a morning visit,’ she said. ‘He just said “Where’s your daughter?” and I said upstairs. He just went to the sitting room upstairs. I trusted him. You just don’t expect those sort of things.’ The mother, who was friends with Harris’s wife Alwen Hughes, 82, did not notice anything untoward at the time. She said she was ‘completely amazed’ when her daughter made the allegations at the Sunday lunch in 1996. Yesterday, her husband said he was devastated by his daughter’s confession. ‘I really could not believe it,’ he said. ‘I wrote him a letter expressing my disgust and saying that I didn’t want to speak to him or have anything to do with him again.’ Harris wrote back two weeks later begging forgiveness for ‘harming’ his daughter and ‘affecting’ her life. But the entertainer claimed the affair started when she was an adult. Note: Harris sent this light-hearted note to his alleged victim, the court heard . The girl allegedly molested by Rolf Harris confided in a schoolfriend that he was a ‘dirty old man’, the court heard yesterday . She told her classmate when they were 16 how the entertainer would abuse her, the jury heard. ‘She described him as a “bit of a dirty old man”,’ the friend said. ‘What she described was that he used to get her to sit on her lap and then touch her up. ‘It was a shocking conversation because he is well loved by a lot of people. I remember feeling quite horrified on her behalf.’ The friend said she next spoke to her friend about the matter many years later in 1996 when they were both around 30. ‘She basically told me that Rolf Harris had been abusing her throughout her teenage years and beyond,’ she said. The friend said she advised her to go the police but the girl wanted to avoid a ‘media circus’. The father told jurors: ‘The thing that really struck me was that if the argument was that nothing took place before my daughter was 19, it seemed to me this was rather at odds with the content and the tone of the rest of the letter.’ The girl’s family told the court that they did not want to contact police at the time because she needed help to battle her alcoholism. Doctors later warned that the woman, who allegedly started drinking gin at the age of 14 to block out the pain, that she would die if she did not stop drinking. She is said to have told a number of therapists about the alleged abuse from the mid-1990s. One told the court in a statement: ‘I got the feeling she was overwhelmed by his charisma and celebrity status and didn’t feel able to say no to him.’ Testimony: Harris listening to the evidence with the help of a hearing device . She also indicated that she was willing to ‘forgive’ Harris for ‘ruining’ her life, the jury heard. But she told her GP how the publicity surrounding the Jimmy Savile scandal changed her mind. Having been sober for a number of years, she went to police in 2012, telling another brother that she wanted to ‘reclaim her life’. He told jurors: ‘She said that she felt ready to go to the police and to actually put it out in the open.’ Harris’s wife of 56 years was absent from the public gallery for the first time since the start of the trial as the former family friends gave evidence. Harris denies 12 counts of indecent assault involving four women between 1968 and 1986. The trial continues.

Here is the full text of a letter read in court written by Rolf Harris to the father of one of his alleged victims in March 1997: . 'Dear [the father], . 'Please . forgive me for not writing sooner. You said in your letter to me that . you never wanted to see me or hear from me again, but now [the alleged . victim] says it's all right to write to you. 'Since that trip up to Norfolk, I have been in a state of abject self loathing. How we delude ourselves. 'I . fondly imagined that everything that had taken place had progressed . from a feeling of love and friendship - there was no rape, no physical . forcing, brutality or beating that took place. 'When . I came to Norfolk, [the alleged victim] told me that she had always . been terrified of me and went along with everything that I did out of . fear of me. 'I . said 'Why did you never just say no?'. And [the alleged victim] said . how could she say no to the great television star Rolf Harris. 'Until she told me that, I had no idea that she was scared of me. 'She laughs in a bitter way and says I must have known that she has always been scared of me. I honestly didn't know. '[The . alleged victim] keeps saying that this has all been going on since she . was 13. She's told you that and you were justly horrified, and she keeps . reiterating that to me, no matter what I said to the contrary. 'She . says admiring her and telling her she looked lovely in her bathing suit . was just the same as physically molesting her. I didn't know. Nothing . took place in a physical way until we had moved to Highlands. I think . about 1983 or 84 was the first time. 'I can pinpoint a date was 1986, because I remember I was in pantomime at Richmond. 'When . I see the misery I have caused [the alleged victim] I am sickened by . myself. You can't go back and change things that you have done in this . life - I wish to god I could. 'When . I came to Norfolk, spent that time with [the alleged victim] and . realised the enormity of what I had done to [the alleged victim], and . how I had affected her whole life, I begged her for forgiveness and she . said 'I forgive you'. Going home: Harris, who denies all of the charges, is pictured climbing into a vehicle following his day at court . Case: Harris, 84, faces a total of 12 counts of indecent assault on four alleged victims between 1968 and 1986 . 'Whether she really meant it or not, I don't know. I hope she did, but I fear she can never forgive me. 'I . find it hard to like myself in any way, shape or form. And as I do . these Animal programmes, I see the unconditional love that dogs give to . their owners and I wish I could start to love myself again. 'If . there is any way that I could atone for what I have done I would . willingly do it. If there is a way I can start to help [the alleged . victim] to heal herself, I would willingly do it. 'With . your permission I'll phone you in a week to talk to you. If you hang . up, I will understand, but I would like to talk to you to apologise for . betraying your trust and for unwittingly so harming your darling [the . alleged victim]. 'I know that what I did was wrong but we are, all of us, fallible and oh how I deluded myself. 'Please forgive me, love Rolf. 'Please . forgive me for what must have been the most insensitive thing in your . eyes - sending the book for Christmas.

"By . Rebecca Camber . A mother of three who says she was molested by Rolf Harris at age 15 has become the first of the star’s alleged victims to waive her right to anonymity. Tonya Lee, 43, became suicidal, developed an eating disorder and binged on alcohol after he sexually assaulted her twice in a London pub, she told his trial yesterday. The former child actress said Harris, now 84, laughed as he abused her. Tonya Lee in 1986, the year the alleged offence took place (left). She claims she was sexually assaulted by Rolf Harris She was 15 at the time. Right, Ms Lee leaving court in a car with police officers earlier today . It was announced at the start of the day that she had waived the anonymity given to alleged sex attack victims. Jurors . saw a picture of the 15-year-old on the ‘trip of a lifetime’ in 1986, . when she travelled from her home in Australia to perform in British . theatres. But Southwark . Crown Court heard that the children’s TV presenter left her so . traumatised she needed hospital treatment in her 16-year battle with . anorexia. Jurors heard she tried to end her life with a potentially lethal mix of laxatives and alcohol. Fighting . back tears, she said Harris made her feel like an ‘empty vessel’ until . her children, a seven-year-old and twins aged five, gave her a reason to . live. Rolf Harris arrives at Southwark Crown Court this morning where he is on trial for 12 counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986 . Australian Tonya Lee, who has waived her right to anonymity, told the court that Harris molested her during a trip to the UK in 1986 . She said: ‘I was drinking. I had eating disorders and I was taking 80 laxatives a day for eight years and throwing up.’ The alleged attacks happened in a London pub on the first night of her six-week tour with the Shopfront Theatre Youth Group. Miss Lee was overwhelmed with excitement when Harris met the group of 14 children at Heathrow Airport as a surprise. The court heard Harris met Ms Lee's theatre group when they landed at London's Heathrow Airport and later went for dinner at a pub with them . Harris has been supported by his wife, Alwen (second from right) and daughter Bindi (left) throughout the trial . An artist's impression of Rolf Harris in court today as he hears the evidence of one of his accusers . Count 1: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on girl aged 15 .

The former television presenter denies all the counts . She . said she felt ‘special’ when he singled her out at a pub meal later on. Her family idolised him and often played his 1960 hit, Tie me Kangaroo . Down Sport. Miss Lee said . Harris told her: ‘Hey Tonya, come over and have a chat to me. Come and . tell me a bit about yourself. Come and sit down on my lap.’ She . sat astride him, she said, adding: ‘He was moving back and forth, just . rubbing against me. He began moving his hand up my inner thigh, higher . and higher. I started to panic then. ‘I . was confused because the whole time this was happening normal . interactions were going on . . . Rolf would say a joke and people would . be laughing.’ She fled to the toilets, but he waited outside and a second assault took place, she added. She said: ‘I froze. He put one arm around me in a bear hug – I could see no escape.’ Jurors . heard the married father of one, then 56, pinned her between a wall and . a pot plant. He put his hand down her blouse and then into her . knickers. He touched . her intimately, hugged her and left her in a corridor, it was alleged. She said: ‘I was shocked, completely in disbelief. ‘I felt like if I said anything everyone would hate me and blame me because he was Rolf Harris.’ Miss . Lee said she went on to shed 13lb on the tour, believing no one would . attack her if she was thin. At home, she gave up her dream of acting. She said: ‘I became a master of putting on this happy mask.’ The court heard she went to police last May after seeing a Press report of Harris’s arrest. Miss Lee said her ex-partner had encouraged her to sell her story to an Australian magazine and TV show for £33,000. Sonia Woodley, QC, defending Harris, accused her of ‘spicing up’ her story with a PR agent and lying to police about money. The . witness choked with tears as she admitted lying to officers and said . selling the story was a ‘huge mistake’. She added: ‘Not, in a million . years, did I ever think that I would get a chance to sit here in a . courtroom in England and say what happened.’ Harris, . from Bray, Berkshire,  listened intently, passing notes to his . barrister. He is accused of attacking four women aged seven to 19 from . 1968 to 1986. He denies 12 counts of indecent assault.

"By . Paul Bentley . and Rebecca Camber . and Gerard Couzens . and Mark Duell . Scotland Yard detectives flew in to Portugal last night ahead of excavation at the holiday resort where Madeleine McCann vanished. But the arrival of the team, led by Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, comes as tensions with the Portuguese authorities escalated, with fears the investigation could be derailed at any point. After almost two years of delicate negotiations, Scotland Yard has been given permission to start digging at sites surrounding the holiday resort in Praia da Luz where the youngster disappeared seven years ago. Scroll down for video . Aerial view: Specialist officers are also expected to examine three other sites in Praia da Luz after permission to dig was granted by Portuguese authorities, seven years after Maddie went missing from the area aged three . Madeleine, who would be ten on 12 May, was three when she vanished from her holiday flat on May 3, 2007 . A large wasteland yards from the Ocean Club complex will be dug up, . plus an area beside the beach as well as roads by the church in Praia da . Luz where Gerry and Kate McCann prayed for the safe return of their . daughter. But while Met . detectives instigated the new searches and will cover the huge costs . involved, the work is controlled by the Portuguese. There are even concerns that the Met may be banned from ‘witnessing’ the digs. In . a further setback, a request to search the homes of some of the prime . suspects in the case has been rejected. The three former staff members . at the Ocean Club are considered ‘people of interest’ by the inquiry. Analysis . of mobile phone data suggests the men were close to the scene of her . abduction and were in contact in the hours that  followed. One . theory is that burglars raided the McCanns’ flat and were panicked into . snatching Maddie when she woke up. Met detectives reportedly requested . the men’s bank details and asked local officers to quiz the trio and . search their homes. But the judge who dealt with the requests ‘did not consider Scotland Yard’s arguments valid’, local sources said. Search site: The waste ground in Praia da Luz, Portugal, where Scotland Yard officers will join local police officers in digging as part of the investigation . Abroad: Specialist search teams will start by scouring sites across Praia da Luz - including this waste ground near the Ocean Club apartment complex . The digs are not thought to necessarily be in connection with a search for the youngster's body or remains . This land that was not fenced at the time of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is contiguous to the path where witnesses saw a man passing with a child in pyjamas in her arms the night of the disappearance . The . Met team is part of Operation Grange, which was set up in 2011 to . investigate the disappearance of Maddie, whose 11th birthday is on . Monday. British detectives have since expressed their growing frustration at the length of time the probe is taking. The Mail told yesterday how a large . wasteland yards from the complex will be dug up, as well as an area . beside the beach and roads by the church in Praia da Luz where Gerry and . Kate McCann prayed for the safe return of their daughter. But . while Met detectives instigated the new searches and will pay for them, . they may only be allowed to watch while the work is controlled by the . Portuguese. In a further . set-back, officers have been told a request to search the homes of . suspects who worked at the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz has been . rejected. The stand-off has come after the Met set up Operation Grange in 2011 to investigate the toddler’s disappearance. Portuguese . authorities refused to mount a joint investigation, preventing Scotland . Yard from carrying out its own activities in Portugal, and a number of . requests have since been snubbed. In . a letter to the media yesterday, Met Police assistant commissioner . Mark Rowley suggested the relationship between the forces was on a knife . edge. He warned officers . could not keep the public up to date with information in case it upsets . Portuguese authorities. ‘The advice I am receiving from Portugal is that . their approach is very different,’ he said. ‘If . we provide any briefings or information on the work they are . undertaking on our behalf activity will cease until that problem . dissipates. ‘We will not be able to provide any information concerning the activity because ultimately it could mean the work stops.’ 'We will not be able to provide any information concerning the activity because ultimately it could mean the work stops' Mark Rowley, Met Police assistant commissioner . Deputy . assistant commissioner Martin Hewitt added: ‘We have been issuing a . number of letters of request. Some of the requests are not being acceded . to. ‘It’s not fatal to . what we are going to do - it’s their judicial authority.’ He said they . were not being refused because of any lack of resources. ‘That’s . causing us frustration because we know what we want to do and we are . ready to go with that. But the process is the process,’ he added. Maddie disappeared on May 3, 2007, when she was three years old. Her 11th birthday is next week. The . cold case review into her disappearance has involved the painstakingly . analysis of every document collected during the multi-million pound . inquiry. Appeals on BBC’s . Crimewatch led to new information and officers now plan to dig up key . areas of Praia da Luz, just yards from where she vanished. Resort: Police are digging near the Ocean Club holiday apartments in the resort of Praia da Luz in Portugal, from where Madeleine McCann, then three, went missing in May 2007 . Dig: Detectives were also said to be excavating part of the beach in the area (pictured shortly after Madeleine's disappearance) Madeleine's parents Gerry, 45, and Kate McCann, 46, attended an open-air prayer service on Saturday . A . key area to be searched is an overgrown wasteland, which was bought by . Irish developers before being abandoned because of a property crisis in . the area. Metropolitan . Police’s Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowler has blamed the Portuguese . authorities for the lack of information being made public by Operation . Grange. In an open letter . dated today, the senior police officer said that despite pleas for the . media to be briefed on ongoing developments in the search for Madeline . McCann, Portugal’s Policia Judiciara have threatened to stop work if . information is passed on. Revealing . the ongoing tension between British and Portuguese police, Assistant . Commissioner Rowley said he had explained to his opposite number in the . Policia Judiciara that it is the Met’s preferred practice to make public . as much information and context as possible, providing it does not . compromise the investigation. He . revealed that the reply from the Portuguese police was that they do not . brief the media on an ongoing investigation, accompanied by a threat . that if any information were to emerge, the work undertaken by Portugal . on behalf of Scotland Yard would ‘cease until that problem dissipates’. ‘It . is important you understand this and appreciate the position in which I . find myself. We will not be able to provide any information concerning . the activity because ultimately it could mean the work stops,’ Assistant . Commissioner Rowley said. ‘We . respect the Portuguese position as we would expect them to respect our . position if we were carrying out work on their behalf in the UK,’ he . added. Portuguese . detectives will use radar equipment and mechanical diggers to excavate . the site, while officers on foot will conduct fingertip searches. Local . reports suggested cadaver dogs could also be used in the searches - a . controversial development considering the flawed initial Portuguese . police case against the McCanns relied on evidence from two British . sniffer dogs. Also targeted . will be an area by the beach, two locations in the surrounding . countryside and land near Our Lady of the Light Church in Praia da Luz, . where Gerry and Kate were given keys to pray alone after Maddie . disappeared. Met officers - who will pay for the work - will be in the area but can, at best, only supervise. There . are even concerns they may be banned from ‘witnessing’ the digs, with . decisions on the details involved due to be made imminently by . Portuguese authorities. Respected . Portuguese newspaper Jornal de Noticias wrote: ‘The logistics necessary . for the execution of all this work will be costly. ‘It will be paid for by the UK which has already spent nearly seven million euros on this investigation.’ After . 26 trips to Portugal to negotiate the work, British detectives have . also been told they will not be allowed to raid the homes of three key . suspects who worked at the Ocean Club when Maddie disappeared. And, as none of the suspects is British, the Met does not have jurisdiction to make arrests. The . three former staff members, who are thought to have carried out . break-ins at the resort, are considered ‘people of interest’ in the . inquiry. Analysis of mobile . phone data suggests the men were close to the scene of her abduction and . were in contact in the hours that followed. One theory is that the burglars raided the McCanns’ flat and were panicked into snatching the youngster when she woke up. Portuguese police initially searched the resort, but the Met will look for anything they might have missed .

But the judge who dealt with the requests ‘did not consider Scotland Yard’s arguments valid,’ local sources said. A . spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office in Portugal said: ‘The . content of the requests formulated by the British authorities is . confidential.’ British . police are said ‘discreetly’ to be on the ground in Portugal already, . with a full team is expected to arrive in the coming days.

"By . Rebecca Camber . High life: Alex Hope, 25, pictured with reality TV star Layla Flaherty, posed as a City high-flier to earn millions . A catering manager who posed as a City whizzkid to run a £5.6million Ponzi fraud spent £2million on champagne, nightclubs and casinos, a court heard yesterday. Alex Hope, 25, told investors he could make them a fortune from foreign exchange trades. But the ‘City high-flier’ was in reality a former catering manager at Wembley Stadium. He used the cash from investors as his ‘personal piggy-bank’, spending £125,000 on a single bottle of champagne – a Nebuchadnezzar, which holds 15 litres – Southwark Crown Court heard. He repaid them using cash from new investors in the fraudulent Forex scheme. Hope frittered away almost £1million in casinos and racked up bar bills of £500,000 mixing with stars at exclusive nightclubs after he reinvented himself as a Forex trader. He boasted of his rags to riches story in the Daily Telegraph in May 2011, claiming he made his fortune after reading a book on how to trade currencies during his commute to Wembley. Prosecutor Sarah Clarke said: ‘He promised investors and potential investors huge returns. In truth this was not a real trading scheme at all... it was a classic Ponzi fraud. He used their funds as his personal piggy-bank. A massive amount was spent on himself.’ Hope got through £2million in the 13 months before his arrest in early 2012, she said. ‘The investors who put in the money in good faith had no idea this was happening.’ The jury heard that Hope paid a PR company £3,000 a month to promote his image as a successful trader. He bragged about his financial wizardry, claiming he made £600 profit on his first day of trading the dollar against sterling and in only two and a half months his initial £500 stake had grown to £2,500. Jurors were played a showreel video of . Hope in which he boasted of his success saying: ‘You don’t get many . young people working in the City doing what I do. I like to do a lot for . people – I’m not doing this just to make money for my business but also . to create jobs for others.’ The . film, produced by his cohort Raj Von Badlo, was uploaded on YouTube in . February 2012 while Hope was trading losses of £500,000 and had . liabilities of nearly £2million. The catering manager claimed he learned how to make his millions from reading a book on his commute . He is alleged to have used new investors’ funds to pay off those who wanted to leave the scheme. The court heard that Hope also began teaching novice traders how to spread bet, even though he was making huge losses whenever he dabbled in the currency markets. Retired teacher Christopher Millard ploughed £15,000 of his redundancy package into Hope’s scheme after attending his training sessions. Hope promised to double Mr Millard’s . initial £10,000 investment within three months, but used the money to . fund his lifestyle, Miss Clarke said. After . suspicions around his Forex fund grew, City of London police raided . Hope’s flat in Canary Wharf and arrested him last April. His cohort Raj Von Badlo, pictured at Southwark Crown Court yesterday, made a video of Hope boasting . Von Badlo, who is said to have promoted the fraud, then withdrew £95,000 from cash machines, the jury heard. Hope denies fraud but admits violating City rules that he must have a licence to work on behalf of others, although he is allowed to trade currency for his own profit. Von Badlo, 56, denies concealing £95,000 in criminal property, carrying on a regulated activity when not authorised and making misleading statements. The trial continues.

"By . Rebecca Camber . A crazed father who stabbed his partner and six-year-old son to death has sparked outrage after launching a bid to inherit his victims’ estate from behind bars. Paul Chadwick, 35, was detained indefinitely in a secure mental health unit last year after going on a bloody rampage, knifing his son Joseph 25 times and his partner Lisa Clay 32 times at their home. The father of one stabbed Miss Clay before turning the knife on his terrified son after he awoke to hear his mother screaming and ran into his parents’ bedroom. Killer Paul Chadwick has launched a bid to inherit the £200,000 estate of his victims, partner Lisa Clay (left) and their son Joseph . But now the deranged killer is trying . to get his hands on his victim’s £200,000 estate using a legal loophole . reserved for victims of domestic violence. Yesterday . Miss Clay’s grieving family said they were ‘sickened’ after the . paranoid schizophrenic lodged papers at the High Court demanding access . to the £150,000 semi-detached home he shared with his 40-year-old . partner in Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire, his son’s £30,000 trust fund, . and £16,000 in joint bank accounts. To . add further insult, he is demanding that his victim’s aunts, uncles and . cousins, who stand to inherit the estate, fit the bill for his legal . costs. If he is . successful, the test case could set a precedent for other killers to . make claims on the grounds that their mental health was impaired at the . time. Yesterday Miss . Clay’s distraught family issued a statement saying: ‘We were stunned . when we found out he was taking legal action to try to claim the . inheritance. ‘He robbed them of their lives, their futures, and now he wants to take their money. This is a matter of justice. ‘This has caused a great deal of distress to us. ‘The thought that Lisa’s killer can profit from his crime is too appalling for words. ‘We can’t afford to be dragged into a lengthy legal fight.’ Chadwick launched a frenzied attack on his family, stabbing six-year-old Joseph (pictured with his mother) 25 times before turning the knife on Miss Clay, stabbing her 32 times . Miss Clay’s relatives, who do not want to be named, have been forced to raid savings to fight the killer’s case. The . law states those convicted of murder or manslaughter cannot inherit . from their victims or profit in any way from their crimes. But . under the Forfeiture Act of 1982, there is clause allowing the rules to . be bent if ‘the justice of the case requires the effect of the rule to . be so modified in that case’ due to exceptional circumstances in the . conduct of the offender or deceased. For . example, if a battered wife who has suffered years of violence at the . hands of her partner suddenly retaliates and accidentally kills her . partner without intending to, they may still be able to inherit his . estate on his death. Chadwick, . who is currently being held at a secure hospital in Preston, lodged a . claim at Preston High Court just three months after pleading guilty to . manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility last September. The . landscape gardener, who had been due to visit a psychiatrist on the day . of the double killing on April 9 last year, had been charged with . murder. But the plea to the . lesser manslaughter charges were accepted following psychiatric . reports, which led to the killer being transferred from Preston prison . to the Guild Lodge facility near the city. Preston . Crown Court heard that Chadwick crept downstairs in the middle of the . night to grab two kitchen knives which he stashed under the bed. He . stabbed his sleeping partner a number of times, but she managed to get . out of bed and run downstairs for help when their six-year-old son . appeared in the doorway. Chadwock was detained indefinitely at the Guild Lodge mental health facility in Preston, Lancashire . Chadwick stabbed him three times before pursuing Miss Clay and knifing her in a frenzy. When . he returned upstairs to find his son still breathing, he plunged the . knife three inches into his neck and took him back to his bedroom, . laying his arms across his chest, before turning the knife on himself in . a botched suicide attempt. Chadwick's . mother Susan discovered the bodies minutes later when she peered . through the letter box after Joseph failed to arrive at day care that . morning. She called police after seeing Miss Clay's body lying in the hallway and Chadwick, lying wounded at the bottom of the stairs. When he was interviewed by detectives, Chadwick claimed he wanted the three of them to be 'together in death'. He said, ‘I feel awful, terrible, I wish I could turn the clock back. I have done wrong, I love my boy and my girl. 'I didn’t mean to. I killed them but I don’t know why I did it.' Days . earlier, Chadwick had complained of hearing voices and told his . girlfriend, who worked part-time in a Marks & Spencer store, he was . concerned that people thought he was gay. Mr . Justice King ordered him to remain in hospital handing him an . ‘unlimited’ restriction order, which means he will only be released on . the consent of the Secretary of State. But . Chadwick has managed to contact lawyers who lodged a claim arguing that . because he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he carried . out the attack he is still entitled to the assets and house bought by . Miss Clay using money she inherited from her family because he was the . beneficiary of her will. His . claim submitted by law firm, Clarkson Hirst, states: ‘In light of the . claimant having suffered from an abnormality of mental functioning and . with reference to the psychiatric evidence provided in criminal . proceedings in relation to the offence, the claimant seeks a . modification of the forfeiture rules… allowing him to inherit the estate . of the late Lisa Jane Clay and the late Joseph Chadwick.’ He . is seeking to fund his legal battle through monies from the estate and . has launched a claim for ‘costs’ from his victims’ heartbroken . relatives, who learnt of the action just days before Christmas last . year. Keith Etherington, of Slater & Gordon, who is representing Miss Clay’s family, said: ‘They are sickened. ‘There is a sense from the family this does not demonstrate any type of remorse for what he has done. ‘It has extended the suffering unnecessarily for these people. ‘This is a shameful action. It has put them through costs they can’t really afford.’ He . added: ‘We do not believe that the law was written to allow people like . Paul Chadwick to benefit from his crime. We intend to fight his claim . on behalf of the family.’","Paul Chadwick was detained in a secure mental health unit last year .

"By . Mark Duell . and Rebecca Camber . This is the mafia don who will be allowed to return to his life of hiding in Britain after a blunder by prosecutors seeking his extradition to Italy. Domenico Rancadore, who had covered his face with a scarf when arriving and leaving court, was pictured yesterday during the last, farcical stages of his legal battle. Rancadore was told in court that he would not have to face justice at home because prosecutors had missed the deadline to appeal against a decision to allow him to stay in Britain – by a matter of hours. Scroll down for video . This is Domenico Rancadore, the mafia don who will be allowed to return to his life of hiding in Britain after a blunder by prosecutors seeking his extradition to Italy . Legal wranglings: The couple leave Westminster Magistrates' Court after the hearing, which was told that an appeal against the ruling had been lodged by the CPS but was not served within the statutory time limit . The blunder means Rancadore can settle . back into the quiet existence he built himself over two decades in the . London suburb of Uxbridge. In . Italy, he had been sentenced in his absence to seven years in jail for . running Cosa Nostra, a branch of the Sicilian mafia involved in . extortion, racketeering and drug trafficking. Last . week a judge ruled that he could not be sent back after a European . Court of Human Rights ruling was upheld in the High Court, saying that . chronic overcrowding in Italian jails breaches human rights laws. However, senior district judge Howard Riddle invited prosecutors to appeal. Long-running case: Rancadore and his wife report at Uxbridge Police Station in West London on March 18 . But yesterday, the 65-year-old was told that he would face no further proceedings. Westminster magistrates heard that the . Crown Prosecution Service had lodged an appeal at the High Court. But . they failed to serve papers to Rancadore’s solicitors until Tuesday . afternoon – just 14 hours after the seven-day deadline. The High Court will formally dismiss the appeal within days, while prosecutors have already withdrawn the claim. Yesterday . district judge Quentin Purdy said: ‘There is an agreement there are no . future proceedings against you. You’re free to go as far as this court . is concerned.’ Free man: Rancadore, 65, is pictured again with his wife Anne (left) and in an archived police mugshot (right) He granted .

"By . Steph Cockroft . It boasts that it has the most 'intriguing' display of wax sculptures - and that's certainly not a false advertisement. But it seems the creations at the Movielands Wax Museum of the Stars might be intriguing for all the wrong reasons. Visitors to the museum in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, might find themselves not only trying to work out which waxwork they are looking at, but trying to cast their mind back to the film in which they starred. Scroll down for video . Clever . disguise? Waxwork versions of George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Brad . Pitt, who starred in Ocean's Eleven, Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen, . are just some of the models on show at the museum in Ontario, Canada . No, baby, no: The museum features celebrities from the music and film world, including Austin Powers, left, who was huge in the 90s, and an in-demand Miley Cyrus, right - but from her more demure days as Hannah Montana . Recognise these Hollywood stars? Michelle and Barack Obama get a wax makeover at the Movieland Wax Museum of the Stars - even though it features stars from the film and entertainment world . The collection of works bills itself as a walk through 'entertainment history' - but it seems to have largely forgotten about any history past 2000. While many big stars are featured in the display, they are either unrecognisable in their wax forms or are from films which they starred in during the 1990s. The exhibition does feature scenes from classic films, including the likes of Marlon Brando from the Godfather and Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven. But the display also includes an unrecognisable version of heartthrob George Clooney as Danny Ocean in Ocean's Eleven, as well a confusing version of Colin Pharrell in Phone Booth - despite him having starred in several more blockbusters since that film was made in 2002. And those hoping to catch a glimpse of Miley Cyrus might be confused - because she has been mocked up as Hannah Montana, a role she played as youngster on the Disney Channel. The exhibition also features a questionable version of Michelle and Barack Obama - despite it being home to the 'stars' from the 'movie and entertainment world'. Eddie Murphy as Dr Doolittle and onscreen legend Meryl Streep - in no specific role - are arguably two of the more life-like models at the waxwork exhibition . Joke-r? Jack Nicholson as he starred in Batman - in 1989 - pictured left, while Superman is given a spot - but using Christopher Reeve from the 1978 film . Halle Berry and John Travolta are on display at the museum for their parts in Swordfish, made in 2001, while a baffled-looking Tom Hanks is shown in his seminal role as Forrest Gump - one of the biggest films of the nineties . Other odd-looking models include Michael Douglas in Fatal Attraction, Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump and Elijah Woods as Frodo from the Lord of the Rings. And the reviews on TripAdvisor will not have done much to boost the curator's confidence. One review said he and his guests had a great time at the museum - because they could not stop laughing at the adaptation of the famous characters. Another person said it was 'comical' to look at the models, which looked 'nothing' like the real people, while one reviewer described it as 'by far the worst wax museum I've ever visited anywhere in the world'.

"By . Rebecca Camber . Police have arrested members of a gang suspected of selling counterfeit teeth whitening kits containing dangerous amounts of bleaching agent (stock) Police have arrested members of a gang suspected of selling counterfeit teeth whitening kits containing dangerous amounts of bleaching agent. Officers who carried out raids in Merseyside found dozens of boxes of products with high levels of hydrogen peroxide – which can cause long-term health problems. They held two men, aged 43 and 48, who are thought to be part of an international criminal network importing and selling a range of pirate luxury fashion goods for huge profits. Police believe the suspects were planning to sell the phoney items online and at local market stalls. Hydrogen peroxide levels have been subjected to cuts after concerns that some products were causing damage to teeth, lips and gums. A 2012 European Union regulation says teeth-whiteners must contain no more than 0.1 per cent hydrogen peroxide or chemicals which release the substance. Celebrity endorsements have raised the popularity of teeth whitening over recent years and it is now a multi-million pound business. As a result, fraudsters have moved in on the business – selling pirated kits turned out in overseas factories using sub-standard and even dangerous ingredients. Detectives from the intellectual property crime unit, which was set up last September to tackle the huge quantities of counterfeit goods flooding into Britain, also seized fake designer goods in the raid. Fake cosmetics, sunglasses, Ugg boots, handbags and Liverpool Football Club merchandise were also discovered . Among the hundreds of thousands of pounds of products found piled high in two shipping containers and another property were unbranded electronic cigarette refills, which could pose a significant health risk.

"By . Hugo Gye . A spectacular mansion in rural Scotland has gone on the market for £1.1million - the same price as an ordinary one-bedroom flat in central London. Stracathro Mansion House, which has more than 80 rooms, is being sold by artist Francis Convery, who has been using it as a personal gallery since 2003. However, he has now decided that the Grade I-listed house - near the city of Brechin in Angus - is too big for him, as he does not take advantage of its full 28,000 sq/ft and is frequently embarrassed when visitors comment on the size of his home. For sale: Stracathro Mansion House is currently on the market for £1.1million - even though it has more than 80 rooms . Luxurious: But the property only costs as much as a one-bedroom flat in central London . After a planned sale fell through, the property has returned to the market with a £1.1million asking price - or £1.68million including a coach house and row of cottages on the eight-acre grounds. The Palladian-style mansion is dominated by magnificent Corinthian columns, while inside the walls are dominated by the artworks of its current owner. 'In total there are 87 spaces in the house and you can go for a walk inside,' Mr Convery said. 'People are dumbstruck when they go inside. They don't know what to say. It can be a bit embarrassing. 'The proportions are really energising and I have really enjoyed living here but it is time for a change. The basement and top floor are left on their own at the moment but the middle two floors are used. 'I think the mansion has got great commercial potential. There is room for a bar and spa and it would be excellent for weddings and conferences. People are attracted to the period feel.' Hall: The entrance lobby is decorated in an antique style, dominated by marble columns and flooring . Ornate: The home was built in the early 19th century for a Scottish family which had made its fortune in Jamaica . The £1.1million price tag is the same as a 420sq/ft flat in Mayfair which was recently advertised on the market. That tiny home has just one bedroom, one reception room, a tiny kitchen and a shower room - but central London homes now attract such demand that it was sold for seven figures. Stracathro House was built between 1824 and 1827 for the Cruikshank family, who had made their fortune in Jamaica during the heyday of the British Empire. After the home went into decline in the 20th century, it was acquired by the Government and turned into a military hospital during the Second World War. View: The reception rooms of the home overlook its eight acres of grounds in a beautiful area of Scotland . Garden: There is a pond in the grounds which in itself is larger than many people's homes . The house spent several decades providing flats for doctors and nurses, then in 2003 Mr Convery bought and refurbished the property. The home has a number of spectacular features, including marble floors and fireplaces, enormous French doors, high ceilings and ornate carvings. Each of the three principal reception rooms flow along the northerly aspect and are connected by magnificent double doors. The rooms are highly decorated and have floor-to-ceiling sash and case windows overlooking the terrace. Home: Francis Convery has been living in the house for a decade but has now decided that it is too big for him . Gallery: Mr Convery partly used the mansion as a venue to display his artworks . Julia Willett, from estate agent Strutt & Parker, said: 'Stracathro House is one of the most beautiful properties we have ever marketed in this office. 'It is grand and elegant and everywhere you look there is something beautiful. 'It is a shame that the earlier sale has fallen through but on the other hand this is a great opportunity for someone else to buy this great house.' While £1.1million may be much more than most people can afford for a home, it will go a lot further in rural Scotland than elsewhere in Britain. In the heart of central London, that amount will only buy you a one-bedroom Mayfair flat with a tiny kitchen and shower room. The property market in super-prime areas like Mayfair, Kensington and Knightsbridge has been soaring faster than anywhere else in the country thanks to an influx of wealthy new buyers from Russia and the Middle East. Modest: This one-bedroom flat in central London is on the market for £1.1million . In the up-and-coming east of the capital, £1.1million can get you a four-bedroom terraced house in Hackney, an early 20th-century home spread over three storeys. One of the reasons for the high price tag is that the home comes with a garden - but it is a small patch of lawn not comparable to the eight-acre estate which surrounds Stracathro Mansion House. A more spacious family home can be found in the suburbs, where a four-bedroom semi-detached house in Ealing is currently on the market for £1.1million. This property boasts four bathrooms, an office and a large open-plan living space, but is comparatively cheaper because of its distance from central London. Flat: A penthouse in Sandbanks, Dorset costs the same as the gigantic house in Scotland . Anyone interested in joining David Cameron's 'Chipping Norton set' might take a look at a five-bedroom farmhouse in Oxfordshire, expected to fetch upwards of £1million. The home shares the rural charms of Stracathro, but is rather more modest in scale with just a small front garden and a 'delapidated pigsty' around the back of the house. And for the super-rich in need of a holiday home, £1.1million is the price of a two-bedroom flat in Sandbanks, the Dorset resort which has become the country's most exclusive seaside retreat. The penthouse apartment owes its asking price to a sun terrace overlooking Poole Harbour, as well as Poole's reputation as a favourite hang-out for the rich and famous.","Francis Convery bought the 19th-century Stracathro Mansion House in 2003 and used it as a home and gallery .

"By . Rebecca Camber . Facing trial: Abu Hamza will go on trial next month in New York facing allegations that he controlled a global network of jihadists . Hate preacher Abu Hamza has been dubbed a ‘terrorist leader of global reach’ by the US government who claim he sent ‘lieutenants’ to terror camps worldwide. A decade after he was first arrested in Britain on a US warrant for terrorism charges sparking an extraordinary extradition battle costing British taxpayers over £2million, the hook-handed cleric is finally due to go on trial next month in New York facing allegations that he controlled a global network of jihadists. Prosecutors have lodged legal papers ahead of his forthcoming trial alleging that: ‘The [American] government will show that the defendant was a terrorist leader of global reach who ... sent his young lieutenants around the world to engage in terror training.’ The prosecution will say the preacher used Finsbury Park mosque in north London as a recruiting base, not only inspiring jihadists with his hateful sermons, but also allegedly directly providing support to Al Qaeda from Britain. His trial, which is due to take place at a federal court in Manhattan on April 14, is expected to reveal his alleged links to top terrorist chiefs. Court papers show prosecutors consider him so dangerous that they have argued jurors should be given anonymity and an armed guard for their safety. He faces 11 terrorism charges spanning America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia which go back as far as 1998. If convicted, he faces spending the rest of his life in a maximum security US prison. The trial, scheduled to last six weeks, could prove embarrassing for the British security services and previous governments who allowed the preacher to operate freely for years after he arrived here from Egypt, despite openly giving sermons praising Osama bin Laden in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Court papers allege one of his ‘lieutenants’ from London was sent to Afghanistan for ‘violent jihad training’ and said he was prepared to take part in attacks against American and Jewish targets. He faces 11 terrorism charges spanning America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia which go back as far as 1998. If convicted, he faces spending the rest of his life in a maximum security US prison . Hamza is separately accused of trying to set up a ‘jihad training camp’ in Bly, Oregon where one of his followers is said to have penned a letter to Osama bin Laden saying: ‘We love you here.’ The judge in the case is due to decide this week whether to accept key evidence against Hamza from an Al Qaeda ‘supergrass’ via CCTV from a secret location in Britain. Saajid Badat, a former grammar school pupil from Gloucester, pulled out of a plot to blow up a transatlantic airliner with a shoe bomb in 2001. Hamza is also charged with involvement in a hostage-taking incident in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian . He was later convicted, but freed from jail early in return for agreeing to give evidence against other terror suspects. Badat’s testimony helped to convict Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Bin Laden’s son-in-law, at a separate trial in New York this month. When he first travelled to Afghanistan for training in 1999, he met Saif al-Adel, the terror group’s former security chief. American prosecutors claim that when al-Adel learnt that Badat was British, he asked him if he knew Hamza. Badat is expected to testify that he met one of Hamza’s acolytes in Afghanistan and acted as an interpreter during a key meeting with another Al Qaeda chief when the young recruit was asked ‘whether he would be willing to engage in attacks against US and Jewish targets outside of Afghanistan’. Court papers state: ‘The witness’s testimony about al-Adel demonstrates that the defendant was well known to senior Al Qaeda leadership, and that the defendant was trusted by Al Qaeda to send them trainees.’ Hamza’s lawyers reject Badat’s evidence and are expected to argue that it is unreliable given the deal Badat struck with the authorities to secure his own freedom. They have also asked for any mention of the 9/11 attacks or former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to be banned from proceedings, claiming it would deny their client a fair trial. But this has been rejected by District Judge Katherine Forrest, who has also denied the prosecution’s application to keep jurors’ names secret. Hamza is also charged with involvement in a hostage-taking incident in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian. The preacher was first arrested here in May 2004 on a US extradition warrant and charged with 15 terrorism offences. In 2006 he was jailed for soliciting murder and stirring up racial hatred. He was extradited to America in 2012 after a costly and protracted legal battle invoking human rights law. He denies all the charges.","He is facing trial for terrorism charges in New York .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Carlo Tavecchio, the candidate at the centre of a racism controversy, has been elected as the new president of the Italian Football Federation. The 71-year-old beat former AC Milan player Demetrio Albertini after three rounds of voting in Rome, the governing body announced through its official Twitter account on Monday afternoon. Tavecchio drew heavy criticism last month by making an allegedly racist comment about 'eating bananas' during an address to a summer assembly of Italy's amateur leagues. Controversial: Carlo Tavecchio (centre) has been elected as the new president of the Italian Football Federation . But despite the fact Serie A clubs including Fiorentina and Sampdoria withdrew their backing in the weeks leading up to the elective assembly, Tavecchio was confirmed as Giancarlo Abete's successor at the FIGC when polling 63.33 per cent of the third-round votes after the first two rounds proved inconclusive. He polled 60.20 per cent to Albertini's 35.46 per cent in the first round, which had required a quorum of 75 per cent, and had 63.18 per cent of the votes to his opponent's 34.07 per cent in a second round requiring a quorum of 66 per cent. The delegation was comprised of 278 representatives from Serie A, Serie B, the Lega Pro, the Amateur League, the Players' Association, the Coaches' Association and the Referees' Association. The Lega Pro, which represents 60 third and fourth division teams, last week said nearly all of its members would back Tavecchio, who had been vice-president of the FIGC since 2009. The campaign against his candidacy began when he made an allegedly racist comment when using a fictional example to try to make a point about the number of foreign players in the Italian leagues. Backing: New president Carlo Tavecchio is congratulated by rival Demetrio Albertini (right) Quoted in La Repubblica, Tavecchio said: 'England identifies the players coming in and, if they are professional, they are allowed to play. 'Here, on the other hand, let's say there's (fictional player) Opti Poba, who has come here, who previously was eating bananas and now is a first-team player for Lazio. 'In England he has to demonstrate his CV and his pedigree.' He subsequently apologised but FIFA has since asked the FIGC to conduct an investigation into the comments and to report its findings back to the world governing body. Following his election Tavecchio pledged to prove his doubters wrong. He told FIGC.it: 'I will be a president for everybody, and especially for those who have legitimately expressed their dissent about me taking the job. Challenge: New president Carlo Tavecchio (centre) has vowed to prove his doubters wrong . 'I wish to thank those who have confirmed their confidence in me and who have made me feel supported even during some difficult times. 'Reforming the system can only be done if we work together, there are no magic wands. 'Let us embrace a culture of hard work. I invite all members to abandon feelings of division and to get to work. 'By August 18 I will be able to present to you a list of the things I will have worked on this week.' Among his first tasks will be selecting a new head coach for the Italian national team. Cesare Prandelli resigned following a disappointing World Cup, with former Juventus boss Antonio Conte and ex-Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini reportedly leading the race to replace him.","Tavecchio drew heavy criticism by making an allegedly racist comment .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A pioneering eco-bike made from kitchen worktops can charge devices such as iPhones, cameras and - in theory - electric cars. The Levitation bike is connected to devices using a USB port hidden in the handlebars and stores the energy produced through pedal power. It features a touchscreen monitor that shows how much . electricity has been generated, as well as the rider’s heart rate, plus the bike doubles up as a Wi-Fi hotspot. The eco-friendly Levitation bike, pictured, from U.S firm Dezien is made from the same material used in kitchen workshops and has a USB port hidden in the handlebars. As the pedals turn, energy is stored in a built-in battery that is then used to charge mobile devices and even electric cars . The Levitation bike is the brainchild of architect Michael Strain and designers Ramerio Diaz and Brandon Hartley. They built the zero-carbon device to reduce the emissions produced during commutes. They said: 'It has most of the same parts that a typical bicycle has except its use now becomes greater than just cycling for fun or fitness' This world-first human-powered flying bike was announced last month. Comprising a mix of a bike with wings, a fan, a motor and a parachute, the invention - known as a Paravelo - can reach 4,000ft and speeds of up to 25mph. On the ground, the Paravelo is an ordinary two-wheeled bike fitted with a trailer and a large biofuel-powered fan. With a bit of space to act as a runway, the trailer can be docked with the bike to transform it into a flying machine capable of running for three hours on a full tank of fuel. The Levitation bike is the brainchild of designers Michael Strain, Ramerio Diaz and Brandon Hartley who work under the name Dezien. It has an built-in battery which is charged as the bike is ridden. The energy harvested in the battery from the pedal power can then be used to charge mobile devices connected to a USB port hidden in the bike's handlebars. The generators will continue to store energy as the bike is ridden and at the end of a cycle, the bike can be plugged into a wall socket and offloads any spare power back into the grid. The Levitation's bizarre triangular frame is made from solid surface material HI-MACS - a cross between acrylic and stone, most commonly used for kitchen work surfaces. The bike also has an integrated Wi-Fi hotspot built-in that can be used to wirelessly connect your devices to the internet. Dezien's concept Levitation bike was entered into the 2013 HI-MACS Annual Design Contest in April. This diagram shows off the main features of the bike including an LED touchscreen monitor that shows the battery charge and the rider's heart rate . Other features include an touchscreen LED display that shows the battery's charge level, as well as  front and rear lighting built into the frame of the bike. A spokesman for Dezien, based in Texas said: 'The concept of the Levitation project is that cycling on the community scale can produce clean, healthy, sustainable energy. 'This is achieved by an on-board generator and high capacity batteries that store the energy you create during the act of cycling. 'When you get to where you are going, Levitation has a ‘drain plug’ system that allows you to plug your energy back into the grid. The Levitation's built-in generators will continue to store energy as the bike is ridden and at the end of a cycle, the bike can be plugged into a wall socket to offload any spare power back into the grid using a 'drain-plug' system, pictured . 'Individually, Levitation is great for powering your mobile devices with free energy on the go. 'On the community scale, the benefits of Levitation are exponential, from less carbon emissions during commutes, to healthy living, to producing free zero-carbon energy. 'It has most of the same parts that a typical bicycle has except its use now becomes greater than just cycling for fun or fitness.

"By . Anna Edwards . With over 1.3billion people in the world living without electricity, suggesting a game of football seems the least likely solution to help the chronic problem. But two charitable entrepreneurs have seemingly come up with a way to guarantee power for those left in the darkness - an energy harnessing football. By kicking the SOCCKET ball around, players can generate enough electricity in a 30 minute game to power a LED lamp for three hours. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama kicks the energy-storing soccer ball at Ubungo Power Plant in Dar es Salaam . On your head! The president looked impressed with the ball - which could end millions of people relying on harmful alternative energy supplies . The pendulum-like mechanism inside the SOCCKET captures the kinetic energy generated during normal play . And today, President Barack Obama got to witness just how powerful the ball can be. The president kicked, headed and dribbled the ball around during an event at the Ubungo power plant to promote energy innovation in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, CBS reported. Weighing 17 ounces— just one ounce more than a normal soccer ball - the ball contains a pendulum-like mechanism, which captures the kinetic energy generated during normal play, and stores it in the ball for later use as an off-grid power source. Energy is stored in the SOCCKET ball for later use as an off-grid power source . Lighting up lives: The balls could spell the end of unreliable power sources, the social enterprise says . Bright idea: The power kits mean that if children play with the ball through school, they can plug them in to light up their homework every day . It is the creation of Uncharted Play - a for-profit social enterprise founded in May 2011 by Jessica O. Matthews and Julia Silverman. The pair, who met at Harvard College when they were studying to be social scientists, had no engineering expertise, but worked on the creation of the pioneering ball. The invention could mean an end to unpredictable power sources - and the termination of harmful power sources that are extremely damaging to users' health. 'Households use kerosene lamps, diesel generators, and wood burning stoves, which are harmful to the environment and cause nearly 2 million deaths per year,' Uncharted Play said. 'Living with fumes from one kerosene lamp is the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes every day,' it added. The enterprise says it has created power kits: 'consists of 1 SOCCKET and 10 Portable Lamps. That way, children living in off-grid communities can play with a single SOCCKET ball as a team at school and still have their own personal light for reading and homework at home .","Ball has a pendulum which stores kinetic energy and can be used later .

"By . Paul Nixon . Paul Nixon kept wicket in 882 games during a 22-year career with Kent, Leicestershire and England. Before Jos Buttler’s Test debut in Southampton today, he runs the rule over the keeper’s strengths and weaknesses. ‘He’s a young boy still and we’ve got to accept he is nowhere near the finished article,’ says Nixon. ‘We’ve thrown him in at the deep end, he’s going to make mistakes but we cannot crucify him.’ Debutant: He is set to make his Test bow for England against India on Sunday . CATCHING . The area everyone will notice and an area he definitely needs to work on. He needs to relax, he’s looking a little tense at the moment, which is understandable as there’s a lot of pressure on him because he’s not served his apprenticeship. Verdict: The biggest concern. Patience is a must. Catching practice: Jos Buttler in an England nets session on Saturday . MOVEMENT Needs to get his feet moving a little bit earlier and — it sounds crazy — keep his head just on the inside of his ‘outside’ leg. So if there’s a right-handed batsman, he’s got to get his head going towards the outside edge, which will be towards his big toe on his right leg. His chin needs to be there to follow the ball, not straight down central because otherwise he is losing time in the catching area. Verdict: A fair bit of work to do. Pedigree: He is already established in limited overs cricket for England . STANCEFor me he’s fractionally too upright. He needs a flatter back with his chin closer to his knees so his head’s out in front to keep his weight on the balls of his feet. That will help him access the ball that’s lower — catches at shin and ankle height. If there’s an area Matt Prior struggled with it was those lower catches. Verdict: Work to be done but it’s something Jos can fix very easily. Backup: In training with captain Alastair Cook (centre) and Chris Jordan (right) GLOVEWORK . He’s got to keep making sure his fingers are pointing down as much as he can rather than pointing forward at the ball as he does now. So much is linked in with the stance, as if you’re in the right position it’s easier to take catches and make stumpings. He needs to try to catch the ball with knees slightly bent rather than having his legs straight and his back upright so he can get forward and take the ball early with long arms out in front. Verdict: One of his stronger areas. Not a concern. Batsman: According to a school friend, he was a reluctant wicketkeeper growing up . ON-FIELD LEADERSHIPI think the more confident he gets with his keeping, the more instinctive he’ll be with it and then we’ll see more of the real character of Jos Buttler the keeper.Verdict: A work in progress. Safe hands: But he has been working hard with Somerset to prepare for his chance when it comes . BATTING . We’d rather see Jos playing more of his natural game than anything else. He’ll have a challenge similar to Eoin Morgan’s — does he play in ultrapositive one-day mode or rein it in. Jos will play the situation but in terms of ability he’s more like Kevin Pieteresen and we’d rathersee him play his natural game just as KP did.","Former England wicketkeeper Paul Nixon runs the rule over Jos Buttler .

"By . Ted Thornhill . There’s a teacher in Italy who has very few problems controlling her class – because there’s only one pupil in it. In fact, there’s only one pupil in the entire school. The elementary in the tiny town of Alpette, Turin, is believed to be the smallest in the world and is attended by eight-year-old Sofia Viola. Centre of attention: Sofia Viola is the only pupil at the elementary in Alpette, Turin . The third-grade student is taught all her subjects by 33-year-old Isabella Carvelli - the only teacher at the school. And she admits it is sometimes so lonely she has to imagine there are other children in the classroom. Sofia said: ‘I take a jacket and put it on a chair next to mine, then I open a book on the desk and I pretend there is someone there.’ Sofia hasn't always been the only student at the school, which used to be the city hall. Last year there were four older pupils but they moved on when they finished fifth grade. Next year, she will be joined by some pupils from kindergarten - but for now she has the whole classroom to herself. Numbers down: Last year there were four older pupils at the school, but they moved on when they finished fifth grade . And, as long as there is at least one pupil at the school, officials have decided to keep it open. Ms Carvelli said: ‘When I was asked to teach in Alpette I didn't know where it was or even that it had a school. ‘But I accepted it and it has been an experience that has given me so much.’ Lessons are conducted just as they would be in a class with 20 pupils. Class act: Sofia's parents are very happy with the set-up . Ms Carvelli joked: ‘Everything is exactly the same - except it's a little calmer than a normal school.’ Sofia's favourite subjects are Italian and English and she loves school outings in to the surrounding mountains. She also gets to visit a larger school twice a week where she socialises with other children her age. Following the rules: Lessons are conducted just as they would be in a class with 20 pupils . Her parents Fiorella Vincenzi, 50, and Giuseppe Viola, 57, are more than happy with the set-up.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A strange morphing ‘skin’, which looks like it may be alive, could one day be adorning the surface of cars to make them go faster. The Smorph material, developed by scientists in Massachusetts, uses the same technique that makes golf balls cut through the air faster and straighter. At low speeds, a golf ball’s dimpled surface reduces its aerodynamic drag in half. However, at higher speeds, the effect reverses. The ability to change the surface of the Smorph skin in real time comes from the use of a multilayer material with a stiff skin and a soft interior . This has meant that high-speed vehicles haven’t been able to use this trick to their advantage, but now a team of MIT researchers believes they have a solution. They have created Smart Morphable Surface, or Smorph - a material with a two-layer skin that changes its shape in real-time. The inner layer is flexible silicon, wrapped in a stiff outer layer. When a vacuum sucks the air out of the hollow surface, the movement of the flexible and rigid layers creates dimples in the skin. While a ball with a dimpled surface has half the drag of a smooth one at lower speeds, at higher speeds that advantage reverses. MIT created the 'smorph' material to take advantage of this behaviour (pictured) The ability to change the surface in real time comes from the use of a multilayer material with a stiff skin and a soft interior. This is the affect that causes smooth plums to dry into wrinkly prunes. To mimic that process, MIT made a hollow ball of soft material with a stiff skin, then extracted air from the hollow interior to make the ball shrink and its surface wrinkle. At a certain degree of shrinkage, the surface can produce a dimpled pattern that’s very similar to that of a golf ball - and with the same aerodynamic properties. The aerodynamic properties of dimpled balls can be a bit counterintuitive: You might expect that a ball with a smooth surface would sail through the air more easily. The reason for the opposite result has to do with the nature of a small layer of the air next to the surface of the ball. The irregular surface, it turns out, holds the airflow close to the ball’s surface longer, delaying the separation of the boundary layer. This reduces the size of the wake - the zone of turbulence behind the ball - which is the main cause of drag for blunt objects. 'Numerous studies of wrinkling have been done on flat surfaces,' says Pedro Reis, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering and civil and environmental engineering. 'Less is known about what happens when you curve the surface. How does that affect the whole wrinkling process?' The answer, it turns out, is that at a certain degree of shrinkage, the surface can produce a pattern that’s very similar to that of a golf ball - and with the same aerodynamic properties. The irregular surface holds the airflow close to the ball’s surface longer. This reduces the size of the wake - the zone of turbulence behind the ball - which is the primary cause of drag for blunt objects. Because the surface texture can be controlled by adjusting the balls’ interior pressure, the degree of drag reduction can be controlled at will. 'We can generate that surface topography, or erase it,' Professor Reis says. 'That reversibility is why this is pretty interesting; you can switch the drag-reducing effect on and off, and tune it.' The football being used at this year’s World Cup, for example, uses a similar effect; so do some track suits worn by competitive runners. But in other uses, the ability to alter a surface could prove useful: For example, many radar antennas are housed in spherical domes, which can collapse catastrophically in very high winds. A dome that could alter its surface to reduce drag when strong winds are expected might avert such failures, Professor Reis suggests. The technology could one day be used on the surface of high-speed vehicles, such as this Hennessey Venom GT Spyder. Researchers believe it will help reduce a vehicle's drag . Another application could be the exterior of cars, where the ability to adjust the texture of panels to minimise drag at different speeds could increase fuel efficiency, he says. John Rogers, a professor of materials research and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who was not involved in this work, says, 'It represents a delightful example of how controlled processes of mechanical buckling can be used to create three-dimensional structures with interesting aerodynamic properties. The type of dynamic tuning of sophisticated surface morphologies made possible by this approach would be difficult or impossible to achieve in any other way.' The irregular surface holds the airflow close to the ball’s surface longer improving aerodynamics. The football being used at this year’s World Cup (pictured) uses a similar effect .","Smorph has an inner layer of flexible silicon wrapped in a stiff outer layer .

"By . David Kent . Arsenal have lost a High Court battle over a curb on the number of concerts that can be held at the Emirates Stadium. The Premier League giant had applied to double the number of music concerts from three to six at its north London stadium. Islington Council rejected the application and a planning inspector dismissed the club's appeal in January this year. VIDEO Who needs concerts? Watch Coventry fans making a gig of their own at the Emirates . Blow: Arsenal have lost a High Court battle after applying to hold double the amount of concerts at the Emirates . Arsenal argued at the High Court that there was a 'clear error' in the decision-making process. But its case was rejected today by Mr Justice Cranston, who delivered his judgment in London, ruling that there had been no error of law. Opponents have voiced concerns over noise and rowdy music fans. Concerts featuring Bruce Springsteen, Coldplay and Muse have generated hundreds of thousands of pounds in extra revenue for the club. The inspector said that if Arsenal could afford to buy a player like midfielder Mesut Ozil for £42.5 million from Real Madrid, it could not plead poverty. At a recent hearing, Dan Kolinsky, representing the club, argued before Mr Justice Cranston that the inspector's decision was legally flawed and should not be allowed to stand. Big spenders: Arsenal's purchase of Mesut Ozil for £42.5million was cited as a reason the club did not need to host twice as many concerts . Applying for judicial review, Mr Kolinksy submitted that the inspector had failed to apply the law correctly when he decided the proposal to double the number of concerts 'did not accord with the development plan' for the stadium. Lawyers for the inspector and Islington argued that the inspector followed the correct approach and there was no substance in the club's challenge. During the public inquiry run by the inspector, Arsenal chief executive director Ken Friar said the club needed the money from the gigs to perform in the extremely competitive world of football, citing Manchester United's profits at £100 million compared to Arsenal's £20 million.

The Manchester United midfielder scored the winning penalty as Van Gaal's winning start to his reign continued against Inter Milan on Tuesday night.

And the Scotland international said: 'The fear factor will be back at Old Trafford next season, don’t worry about that.' United lost seven Premier League games at home last season as they slumped to a seventh place finish. Fletcher's team-mate Luke Shaw, meanwhile, insists he is not afraid of working hard to be ready for the new league season. In a frank interview following United's penalty shoot-out win, the left-back conceded Van Gaal had every right to criticise him over his lack of fitness. Van Gaal revealed at a press conference on Monday that he has had to devise a special training programme for Shaw, who turned up for pre-season out of shape after three weeks off. 'Obviously I have seen that, and it's something I totally agree with,' Shaw said when asked about Van Gaal's press conference comments. 'To play in this formation you have to be really fit. I am fit but I am not at the high level he demands. 'I have got to get fitter to get up and down (the wing). It's something I have got to work on.' Van Gaal, meanwhile, praised his side after their shoot out victory. 'I am very pleased,' he said. 'I think we played by far the best match of our sequence of three. 'They only had one shot on our goal and that was given by the referee [a free-kick], but I think we also created six or seven chances, so then it is seven against one. 'I was very pleased with our ball possession; it was much better than the other matches. And I think also the positions were better covered. 'So I was tonight very pleased with the performance of my players, both in the first half and the second half.' Blow: United lost to West Brom at Old Trafford early last season .

"By . David Kent . QPR continued their preparation for their return to the Premier League with a 2-2 draw at Leyton Orient. The Hoops looked on course to record a 2-1 victory at the home of fellow London side Orient, after goals from Junior Hoilett and Joey Barton put them in front following Romain Vincelot's early opener. But a Dean Cox strike six minutes from time denied a Harry Redknapp side without Rio Ferdinand victory at the Matchroom Stadium. Back of the net: Joey Barton gave QPR a 2-1 lead with a curling free-kick two minutes into the second half . Heads I win: Leyton Orient's Romain Vincelot (centre) scores with his head the opening goal past Queens Park Rangers' Steven Caulker (left) and Richard Dunne .

Ferdinand was just one of many admissions from the QPR team, but Redknapp still fielded a fairly strong side with Charlie Austin, Barton and new arrival Steven Caulker all handed starts. And it was the former Cardiff defender who was caught napping early on as he was beaten to a right wing cross by Vincelot who powerfully headed the League One side into a 10th minute lead. It was a deserved lead for the Os but QPR soon hit back nine minutes through Hoilett. The winger took one touch to set himself before firing an effort into the bottom left-hand corner with a 20 yard effort. Barton saw an effort deflected over shortly after but soon turned the game on its head for the Hoops, with a sweetly struck free-kick two minutes after the break. The Hoops looked like they would hold on for a second pre-season win of the season but Dean Cox found space before slotting home with his left foot from just inside the box with just six minutes to play. Despite the late strike, a draw was just reward for Orient who matched QPR throughout the game even forcing Robert Green into a smart double stop just before the hour mark.

Madrid enjoyed the bulk of the possession at the Cotton Bowl but could not find a way past the stubborn Italian defence. The winner arrived just before the hour mark when Totti allowed the ball to run for Alessandro Florenzi before sweeping home the return ball.

The Potters were also left to reflect on missed chances with Marko Arnautovic seeing his first-half penalty, which he won after being brought down, saved. Marc Wilson was also forced off injured in the first half joining Wilkinson and Bardsley in nursing niggles at the right back position. Stoke's latest defeat in Germany follows a 2-0 loss by 1860 Munich as well as a 1-1 draw with Borussia Monchengladbach. Despite failing to win any of their three pre-season games in the country, Potters fans will take positives from Bojan's contribution after a precise strike gave Mark Hughes' side the lead at the Kufstein Arena. The former Barcelona forward showed neat skill to beat his marker from the edge of the box, before quickly firing a snap shot past the stranded Schalke keeper 10 minutes after the break.

The 29-year-old, a sergeant in the island’s police force, arrived in Glasgow fresh from arresting a drug dealer, after all. Francois said: ‘Whenever there’s trouble, who do you think they’re going to call? Me. ‘In July we had to do a drug bust. I fought the dealer, kept him on the ground and took away his drugs. ‘Don’t worry there is no crime (on Turks).

Kenyan 800m runner Cheruiyot Ferguson Rotich, who was second in his heat on Tuesday, must love being in Glasgow after changing his name to honour one of the city’s most famous sons — Sir Alex Ferguson. Why the change? ‘Because they can’t stop winning,’ he said. Clearly the name change occurred pre-2013. .......................................................................... England table tennis player Tin-Tin Ho, 15, won her two matches in the preliminary round of the women’s singles on Tuesday and then delivered a lesson in her art. She’s a ‘penholder’, apparently, meaning her thumb and index fingers grip the racket handle. ‘Penhold style runs in the family,’ she said, ‘because my dad used to play and he was a penholder as well, so he taught me and my brother that way — it’s just how I started.’ SECOND GOLD FOR LUCKY LUCKMAN . The full-bore rifle Queen’s Prize individual event is one of the quirkier events in Glasgow, but it proved a happy hunting ground for England’s David Luckman. The 38-year-old, competing at his first Commonwealth Games, claimed his second gold in four days after winning the pairs with Parag Patel on Saturday. As might be expected of an event that began in 1860, tradition dictated that Luckman was transported to the medal ceremony in a Sedan chair carried by his opponents.

Dan Rivers added another gold for England after a successful day at the shooting. His victory in the 50m Rifle 3 Positions came just four days after winning a bronze in the 10m Air Rifle. ‘I didn’t think it could get much better than the bronze, but it has,’ he said. ‘It’s an amazing feeling. The air rifle was a surprise, but this is my strongest event.’ Rivers’ sporting hero is apparently Sir Bradley Wiggins and now he has a medal that still eludes the great cyclist — a Commonwealth Gold. Shock: England's Daniel Rivers celebrates winning the gold medal in the 50m Rifle three Positions . Mountain Biking made a return to the Games after an eight-year absence, but it ended in disappointment for the home nations. England’s Annie Last finished fourth in the women’s event while Scotland’s Grant Ferguson came fifth in the men’s. Liam Killeen won gold for England the last time it was contested in Melbourne but, despite being one of the pre-event favourites, could only manage sixth. Shooter Jen McIntosh became the first Scottish woman to win five Commonwealth medals after adding silver in the 50m Rifle 3 Positions to her 50m Rifle Prone bronze. The previous Scottish record holder? Her mum, and fellow shooter, Shirley. His name might be X-rated but he put in a performance to match.

"By . David Kent . David Gold has blamed jet lag for the Twitter gaffe that saw the West Ham co-chairman 'favourite' a post criticising his club's already under fire manager Sam Allardyce. Allardyce’s future appeared to be on even thinner ice than it already was after a nightmare pre-season tour of New Zealand ended with losses to Wellington Phoenix and Sydney FC when Gold appeared to endorse a derogatory message about the manager on the social media site. Gold has now said he inadvertently 'favourited' the tweet but in a series of three tweets clarifying his position he stopped short of an apology to Allardyce. Backtrack: West Ham co-chairman David Gold blamed jet lag after he favourited a tweet calling for the axing of club manager Sam Allardyce . Not intentional: David Gold favourited the tweet from 'stephen' about sacking Allardyce . 'After a 33 hour flight from New Zealand, I was in my car scanning through my tweets and it seems I accidently favourited one,' Gold posted on Tuesday. 'It has made some of the papers today (Tuesday) so I should clarify that I did not and would never deliberately or intentionally endorse a tweet that questions our manager's position. Lesson: don't use twitter when you're jet lagged!' Allardyce has been made aware of the fact that Gold, who has 92,000 followers on Twitter, was sent a message by a Hammers fan that read: ‘Is today the day we get rid of BFS?? Fingers crossed.’ 'BFS' is a derogatory reference to Allardyce and Gold’s decision to ‘favourite’ the message has only intensified the speculation that Allardyce’s time at Upton Park may not last to the start of the season. Facing the sack: Big Sam might not even make the first game of the season . Divisive: Allardyce wants to move Ravel Morrison on but co-chairman Sullivan wants to offer him a contract . Allardyce, . who was warned at the end of last season that the owner’s wanted an . improved style of football, has recently clashed with Gold and the other . co-chairman David Sullivan over midfielder Ravel Morrison who has become a peripheral figure under Big Sam but who Sullivan wants to offer a new contract. David Gold's daughter Jacqueline added further intrigue to events at West Ham by tweeting: 'Great to see @davidgold back home after trip to NZ with the team & especially looking forward to the football news at dinner tomorrow night.' Sullivan has also insisted that the record signing of Andy Carroll was a huge mistake. The . striker will miss at least three months of the season with an ankle . injury and Sullivan revealed that he regretted ‘putting all his eggs in . one basket’ by signing the England international. Sullivan also seemed to make Allardyce's position more awkward last week when he revealed the board and the boss were at odds over the future of Ravel Morrison - with the owners wanting to tie the England Under-21 international down on a longer contract despite Allardyce suggesting he does not have a future in his side.

"By . Craig Hope . Alan Pardew thinks Siem de Jong will be the new Teddy Sheringham of the Premier League. De Jong completed his £6million move to Newcastle in July, having scored 75 times in five seasons for the Dutch side despite playing in a withdrawn role, much like Sheringham. And Pardew, who worked with the England No 10 at West Ham, says his new man is a class act in the same mould. Dutch of class: Manager Alan Pardew has high hopes for striker Siem de Jong (L) Carbon copy: Siem de Jong can be Newcastle's own Teddy Sheringham, says Alan Pardew . ‘He is a terrific player,’ said Pardew. ‘I have been lucky enough to have managed great players — and he can be one of the best. He reminds me of Teddy Sheringham, the way he conducts a game and conducts himself.’ During an open training session at St James’ Park, Pardew, unable to talk to the written press under orders from owner Mike Ashley, told the crowd: ‘We hope to give you a season you will remember for a long time. I hope to see more goals this year. ‘We have more options and if a game is not going well we can change it. We have offensive options on the bench.’ Newcastle take on champions Manchester City at St James’ Park on Sunday and Pardew knows the pressure will be on. ‘This place will be full up,’ he said. ‘The expectation will be there as it always is at Newcastle. We have to put on a show. But I think we will give City a really, really good game.’ Pointless! Hatem Ben Arfa has cancelled a meeting with supporters as doubts remain over his future . Midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa was excluded from the session, and cancelled plans to meet supporters on Tuesday. The 27-year-old was banished to the reserves by Pardew earlier in the summer. Meanwhile, Sportsmail understands Ashley’s move to scrap the ticket allowance for backroom staff includes Pardew and his players. Pardew’s No 2 John Carver and ex-England winger Steve Stone were among those now being told to pay for tickets. The initiative applies to all employees, meaning players and management are no longer entitled to free seats for friends and family at home games.

Click here for the full match report from Newcastle 1-0 Real Sociedad . Remy Cabella is a player . At £12million, he is the costliest of the summer signings but it looks a shrewd investment. He is tricky but tireless with it and was the one player who brightened an otherwise dull contest.

The 18-year-old was introduced at half-time in a bid to inject some spark and that he did.

"By . David Kent . Prince Harry has joined a growing list of celebrities who have featured in a selfie during the last couple of months with the growing craze now extending to members of The Royal Family. The Prince, who attended the 800m women's freestyle, photobombed New Zealand Commonwealth Games officials during his time at the swimming event. Harry looked in buoyant mood during the Games - and even gave a cheeky thumbs to the camera when he was in the background of a selfie taken by New Zealand rugby sevens coach Sir Gordon Tietjens, Sport Manawatu chief executive Trevor Shailer and Massey University Professor Emeritus Gary Hermansson . The three men in the their black and white New Zealand team kits leaned in with their arms around each other as the Royal popped up in the background in a white shirt. They were watching the 800m women's swimming freestyle in Glasgow on Monday night, which saw Welsh swimmer Jazz Carlin win gold. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Commonwealth Games: Day 6 review . Cheeky: Prince Harry (back) photobombed the snap taken by New Zealand rugby sevens coach Sir Gordon Tietjens . A chuffed Trevor Shailer quickly changed the photo to his Facebook profile picture. He wrote: 'Photo of the day.... A Royal photo bomb by Prince Harry with Titch (Sir Gordon) and Gary Hermansson at the Swimming venue tonight. Thanks to Bev Hari for taking the pic...fun times supporting our athletes at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games!' The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were also at the event with Harry at the Tollcross Swimming Centre in the Scottish city's east. Harry's move comes after Queen Elizabeth inadvertently photobombed a selfie between Hockeyroo players Jayde Taylor and teammate Brooke Peris on Thursday. They took the picture, which showed the Queen peering into the photo in the background, before their opening match of the Commonwealth Games against Malaysia, at the Glasgow National Hockey Centre. Royal photobomb: The Queen appeared in the background of a selfie taken by two players from the Australian women's hockey team . After Mr Shailer posted the photo as his profile picture on Facebook, he was inundated with comments from friends . The royal seemed thrilled to be introduced to the triumphant athletes at the Glasgow National Hockey centre, and posed for photographs with the Aussie team, nicknamed the Hockeyroos. Despite England's loss, Harry, 29, seemed in a jovial mood and smiled as he mingled with the players, who are favourites to win gold in the games, having taken the top spot in Delhi in 2010 and Melbourne in 2006. Royal welcome: Members of the Australian hockey team - or the Hockeyroos - smile as Harry seems to crack a joke after their victory in Glasgow . Posed up: Members of the team, which beat England 3-0 today and are favourites to take home a gold medal for their performance . After shaking hands with the winning players, Harry went on to pose for photographs with his arms around them. The Prince, presumably in a gracious mood, also commiserated with the England team. Jodie Kenny and Emily Smith, who between them scored their teams' goals, looked particularly thrilled in the aftermath of their victory. The team took the royal visit as further proof of their world domination, later tweeting: 'Prince Harry is on board the #roovolution as meets @Anna_Flanagan and the girls after today's win over England' Giving some tips? The Australian team took home a gold medal at the games in Delhi in 2010 and Melbourne in 2006 . Laughing along: Prince William, left, was also in the frame today meeting the players after their game against England . Happy days: The two princes smiled in the sunshine today as they shook hands and posed with players from both teams . VIDEO Commonwealth Games: Day 6 review . The game means Australia is safely through to the last four, securing the top place finish in Pool B with four wins from four and a goal record of 25 scored and 0 conceded. England began brightly as birthday girl Susannah Townsend found Ellie Watton and tried to attack the goal, but were blocked by Australian keeper Rachael Lynch. Two quick scores, however, had England on the back foot as first Kenny converted from a penalty corner on 17 minutes, before Smith capitalised on a mistake from captain Kate Richardson-Walsh shortly afterwards. Maddie Hinch in the England goal was forced to save two shots from Kenny before the break, while Lily Owsley fired a shot just wide of the mark. A green card for Laura Unsworth proved costly 13 minutes into the second half as shortly after she left the field, Kenny slotted home from another short corner. England kept pressing and earned two penalty corners of their own but on both occasions they couldn’t find the target – Sam Quek seeing an effort deflected behind. Georgie Twigg also made her return for England after missing their last game against Malaysia through the injury she sustained in the opening game. After the match, England coach Danny Kerry said: 'Australia were better than us defensively and offensively in both circles but I actually felt for large periods of the game we were playing the more constructive hockey. 'The reality is that we need to be much tougher in both circles and their corner execution was superior to ours today.'","Prince Harry was seen putting his thumbs up in the picture .

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has angered the club’s coaching staff after withdrawing their complimentary ticket allocation. Alan Pardew’s No 2 John Carver, former England international Steve Stone and goalkeeping coach Andy Woodman are among those who are now being forced to pay for match tickets. Senior members of the backroom team would be given four seats each for games in a private box at St James’ Park, but Ashley has now scrapped their allowance on the eve of the new season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch outcast Ben Arfa's cringeworthy tribute to rapper Tupac . Stunner: Alan Pardew’s No 2 John Carver (left) has been hit by the ticket ban at Newcastle . The billionaire’s money-saving measures have extended beyond the coaching team. Long-serving kit men and administrative staff have also seen their two-ticket privilege taken away. It has left a feeling of resentment towards the owner behind the scenes at the club. In protest, staff refused to accept free tickets for Sunday’s pre-season friendly with Real Sociedad. Managing director Lee Charnley was the man who relayed Ashley’s instruction and Sportsmail understands it did not go down well. It is not known whether Pardew himself is included, although the policy is thought to cover all employees. Staff are upset and shocked that they will now have to pay should they want match tickets for friends and family. Morale among staff at the club’s training ground is now at rock bottom. Controversial: Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has scrapped free tickets for some staff in cost-cutting exercise . The club made no comment when contacted about the matter. Pardew’s thoughts on the issue are not known either as the club are refusing to allow their manager to speak to the press other than when contractually obliged. Pardew himself is thought to be frustrated by this move and would prefer to engage in a healthy dialogue with the media and therefore supporters. Meanwhile, the club will hold an open training session at St James’ on Tuesday. But one player who will not be there is Hatem Ben Arfa. Instead, he has invited fans to meet him at a local bookshop just around the corner from the ground. Frozen out: French midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa has been told he has no future at Newcastle . The French midfielder has been forced to train with the reserves this summer after Pardew questioned his ‘professionalism’. There is little chance of a reconciliation and Newcastle would prefer Ben Arfa to find a new club. The former Marseille man has one year remaining on his contract and the Magpies would like to bring in a fee for the playmaker. However, there is every chance Ben Arfa could head out on loan for the duration of this season before leaving on a free next summer.","Ashley has withdrawn complimentary tickets for some Newcastle staff .

Newcastle United will complete the loan signing of Shakhtar Donetsk striker Facundo Ferreyra early next week but manager Alan Pardew has concerns at the other end of the pitch. The Magpies were beaten 3-1 by Malaga in Gelsenkirchen on Saturday as an inept first-half defensive display allowed the La Liga side to race into a three-goal lead. Pardew took responsibility for the loss – blaming himself for naming a young team – but his back four was made up of skipper Fabricio Coloccini, the experienced Steven Taylor, Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa – a £6.7million signing – and highly-rated left-back Massadio Haidara.

Judgement day: Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot and midfielder Jack Colback look at one another during loss . And the Newcastle boss said: 'I take full responsibility for that first half. It was perhaps a bit too young, so I blame myself for that defeat. 'I put two young lads up the top and maybe it was too much inexperience to cope with a team like Malaga. 'It was Moussa (Sissoko) and (Remy) Cabella's first game so really I'm kicking myself because I should have had a bit more experience on.' Problems at the back: Newcastle boss Alan Pardew admitted his side lacked enough experience for the game . Sergi Darder blasted the opener from distance on 25 minutes before 19-year-old Samu Castillejo helped himself to a double, the first an unmarked volley from eight yards and the second a stunner from the angle of the area. Gabriel Obertan fired a consolation but the former Manchester United winger has already been told he can leave the club.

For having been the man who triumphantly ended Hull City's 110-year wait for European football, it would have been galling to see their dreams shattered after just seven days of continental competition. They were 10 minutes away from such ignominy when substitute Sone Aluko struck his first goal since last September. And Bruce said: 'You're always worried at 1-1 with 15 minutes to go. 'For all the hype and euphoria we very nearly fell at the first fence. But we stuck at it, like we always do, and got there.' It had, however, been a struggle. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steve Bruce's interview after the game . Delighted: Steve Bruve ended Hull City's 110-year wait for European football when they reached the FA Cup final . There were just 90 seconds on the clock when Tomas Malec climaxed a swift Slovakian breakaway with a low finish from 12 yards to stun a sell-out crowd. Shane Long was then guilty of three glaring misses before Ahmed Elmohamady rose to flash home a header from Robbie Brady's centre on 27 minutes. The second-half, however, was in danger of drifting to a sorry conclusion until Bruce injected some energy in the form of Aluko and Tom Ince. And, with 80 minutes on the clock, Elmohamady escaped down the right, centred for Robert Snodgrass to nod back across goal and Aluko was on hand to apply an uncompromising finish. 'I honestly believe that the ability to bring people off the bench won us the game,' Bruce added. Match winner: Sone Aluko scores his side's second goal during UEFA Europa League qualifying . Joy: Tom Huddlestone celebrates with Sone Aluko at the end of the match . 'Bringing on Aluko and Ince gave us a freshness and I'm delighted he (Aluko) got the winner. 'He looked the best he has in seven years, physically. 'I'm delighted that he's scored a goal. We all know the kid has terrific ability. Let's hope he stays injury-free because he will be a big player for us if he does.' Bruce went on: 'We got off to an awful start and that put everyone on edge for 25 minutes. 'We missed three or four glorious chances and you do think “are we going to get it?”. 'But thankfully we did and I'm pleased more than anything for the supporters. Fresh legs: Tom Ince  is congratulated by Jake Livermore after providing the cross for the second goal . 'A guy came up to me before the game and said “I never thought I'd ever see this day” and that's fabulous.' Hull will learn the identity of their playoff-round opponent today but, while Bruce expects an improvement on what was an unconvincing display, he is still keen to add to his squad. 'I always knock the door. The day I say “no” is the day I might as well pack in,' he said. 'If there is a bit of quality I will always try.' On the evidence of this performance, he might just need one or two more to keep alive the dream of Inter Milan coming to Humberside this season.","Sone Aluko scored late winner to secure victory over AS Trencin .

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Rolando Aarons has been the surprise star of Newcastle United’s pre-season preparations. The 18-year-old scored one and created another during the Magpies’ 3-1 victory over Schalke on Sunday. He had terrorised his Champions League opponents throughout and won  praise from manager Alan Pardew after the game. So who is the teenage talent? Sportsmail was at the Veltins Arena this weekend and here we fill you in on the boy who could emerge as a new Toon favourite this season. In a nutshell, who is he? Rolando Aarons was born in Kingston in Jamaica but moved to the UK as a child. He was snapped up by Bristol City’s academy but Newcastle were soon aware of his potential and brought him to Tyneside as a 16-year-old. He scored a goal and created another against Schalke, sounds like an attacking player? That he most certainly is. A left-footed left-winger – yes, they do still exist – Aarons is all about the offensive. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Newcastle's Rolando Aarons score against Schalke . Promising starlet: Rolando Aarons could be Newcastle's surprise package this season . And his strengths? He’s quick with a boxful of tricks to boot. He has a low centre of gravity, the ability to wriggle between opponents and is a robust sort who looks like he’ll bounce back from any meaty treatment served upon him. Tell us more about his performance this weekend? He was bright in the 3-1 defeat against Malaga on Saturday but took centre stage against the hosts 24 hours later. On 10 minutes he turned his full back inside and out before landing an enticing centre onto the forehead of Emmanuel Riviere, who did the rest with a smart finish. His goal arrived after the break and, while a little fortuitous, it was well deserved. He escaped two blue shirts down the left flank before sweeping a cross-cum-shot to the far post where it sailed over the head of the goalkeeper before creeping into the side-netting. He later told manager Alan Pardew it was intended, however. Goalscorer: Aarons celebrates after scoring against Schalke in Newcastle's pre-season win in Germany . Does he remind you of anyone? Jamaican-born left-winger who qualifies to play for England... a certain John Barnes springs to mind but so, too, does Raheem Sterling. Aarons boasts all of the same attributes as the the Liverpool star and is strikingly similar in build and style. He does say that his favourite player is Hatem Ben Arfa, his Newcastle team-mate who Pardew has cast aside after questioning his professionalism. Perhaps the manager would be happier if he found a new role model. Similar style: Aarons will be hoping he can follow  Raheem Sterling in becoming a Premier League star . Has he played for the first-team before? Not in a competitive match. He has progressed through the club’s youth and reserve teams during the past two seasons but is expected to make that step up this time around. And at international level? It’s perhaps a little too early for that, but given his dual nationality we dare say the FA have taken note. What does his manager say about him? ‘Rolando’s the sort of player the fans will love – he’s obviously very quick,’ Pardew has said previously. ‘He plays left side and gets crosses in, which is something we haven’t got in the group. He enjoys playing that role. ‘We’ve had a couple of left-footed players who don’t actually like playing that side, but he has the pace to trouble any full back.’ After the game against Schalke, Pardew told us: ‘The real highlight of pre-season has been Rolando and he was terrific again. ‘It’s nice to see a young player really pushing and I thought he caused real problems for Schalke – long may that continue.’ Long may that continue indeed, we’re certainly hoping he is given a chance to shine this season.

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . Hull City debut in Europe on Thursday night but the surrounds will feel hauntingly familiar, a backwater venue with a capacity which barely breaks 10,000. For it was just over a decade ago that The Tigers finally ended an eight-year exile in the bottom tier on a murky May afternoon at Yeovil Town. Since then they have journeyed from England’s lowest league – via the Premier League and an FA Cup Final – to the Europa League, and from the brink of liquidation – via salvation – to celebration. Volcanic Ash: Ian Ashbee celebrates his goal against Yeovil back in 2004 . Green envy: Hull will be turning out in the Europa League . They take on Slovakian side AS Trencin in their third-round qualifier at the Stadion pod Dubnom in Zilna. It was Ian Ashbee who scored the promotion-clinching goal at Huish Park in 2004 and, while the green seats and intimate setting of Zilna will be the same, he believes the club has come an unimaginable distance since that day. ‘If someone had said to me back then that I would be watching Hull in Europe then I would have laughed, I would have told them they’d been drinking,’ Ashbee – the man who went on to captain the club in all four divisions - told Sportsmail. ‘Yes, the potential was there and it always was a much bigger club than League Two, but they nearly went out of business. They were difficult times. ‘But my goal (a 20-yard curler into the top corner) set the whole thing off, they had been desperate to get out of the bottom division and from there we had momentum. It was the most important day of my career.’ Turning point: Ashbee's goal triggered Hull's rise through the leagues . Fast forward 10 years – three promotions, one relegation and seven managers – and Steve Bruce is leading the club on their maiden odyssey. There is, however, one striking similarity between the team of today and that of 2004 – a British core. Bruce has recruited wisely this summer. Three Englishmen – Tom Ince, Jake Livermore and Harry Maguire – and two Scotsmen – Robert Snodgrass and Andrew Robertson – have been added to the likes of Tom Huddlestone and Republic of Ireland striker Shane Long. Defenders Maguire, 21, and Robertson, 20, arrived only this week from Sheffield United and Dundee United respectively. Theirs is an exciting, young squad reared predominantly on these shores. Best of British: Harry Maguire and Andy Roberton have signed on the dotted line at Hull City . ‘Steve is a top man,’ Ashbee added, ‘I know the lads really like him and he is attracting top players to the club. Some of the signings have really put a marker down. A lot of clubs were after the likes of Tom Ince but Hull got him and that’s huge.’ Andy Dalton – editor of the Amber Nectar fanzine - will be among the 600 Hull fans in Zilna. His journey started at 2am on Wednesday. Like all away days, it took in the M62. He was headed for Luton – just as he had been for a League One fixture in 2005 – only this time his destination was the airport, not Kenilworth Road. From there to Kosice in the south east of Slovakia and then by train across country to Zilna in the north west. He wouldn’t have it any other way. Man with a plan: Steve Bruce has set his sights on reaching the Europa League group stages . ‘My first game was in Division Two in 1990 – I never thought I’d be checking train timetables in Slovakia 24 years later,’ said the 32-year-old. ‘But supporting your club should be fun, it should be an adventure and exciting. We’re all on a massive high right now and who knows where it will end?’ But what about the lows? ‘I remember an away game at Shrewsbury on December 28 in 1998,’ he said with the unerring authority of a man who bears the scars of that perilous period when the club faced winding-up orders on an almost weekly basis and the gates to Boothferry Park were locked. ‘We got beat 3-2 and we were 12 points adrift at the bottom of Division Four. That was the lowest point. But all that does is make you appreciate what we have now.’ Rick Skelton, who writes the From Boothferry to Wembley blog, agrees. ‘We nearly went bust a few times,’ said the 34-year-old. European adventure: Bruce and Jake Livermore in the pre-match press conference . ‘It took us a good few years to scrape our way out of the bottom division but once we did it all took off and this now is just incredible.’ From hard miles to air miles, Hull must now negotiate Trencin and one more opponent before Europa League football – and the prospect of romantic names such as Inter Milan - becomes a regular fixture at the KC Stadium this season. Ashbee, now retired, went on: ‘I still live there and Hull is a city going places; City of Culture for 2017, Premier League and now Europa League football. The city is buzzing and the people are rightly proud. It has put us on the map again.’ Hull. We know where it is now. Just at the end of the M62.

Mark Cavendish was quick to apply a sense of perspective after withdrawing from the Tour de France with the injury he suffered in a dramatic crash at the finish of the opening stage. ‘I’ve got friends who have come back from Afghanistan with the armed forces,’ he said. ‘You saw my Help for Heroes helmet yesterday. 'My friend Josh is a double amputee and missing his right arm. He sent me a message joking saying ""I’ve got a spare arm for you"". Down and out: Mark Cavendish has had to pull out of the Tour de France after injuring his shoulder . Ouch: Prime Minister David Cameron winces at the crash, which shattered the Manxman's hopes for this year . ‘I’ve also got friends like Taylor Phinney, who is out for the rest of the season. I’m in the left-handed club with him for a bit now but things could be worse. And it was my fault.’ The Isle of Man rider was indeed at fault after trying to squeeze through a gap that just wasn’t there as the riders sprinted towards the finish in Harrogate on Saturday. He bored into Australian Simon Gerrans with his head in a desperate bid to create some space, succeeding only in bringing both of them down as German Marcel Kittel sped away for the stage win. After an MRI scan at a nearby hospital it emerged that Cavendish had suffered ‘ligament ruptures with an AC-joint dislocation’ in his right shoulder. Yesterday morning’s news that he had boarded the Omega Pharma-Quickstep team bus to York racecourse for the start offered a glimmer of hope. My fault: Cavendish has taken the blame for causing the crash as he tried to get in position for the sprint . Carnage: The sprinter says he knew something was wrong as soon as he hit the ground . But the team then confirmed the fears of cycling fans hoping to see Cavendish sprint to glory on The Mall at the end of today’s third stage after failure to do so at the London Olympics in 2012. Had he beaten Kittel along Harrogate’s Parliament Street, it would have been his 26th stage win and his first opportunity to wear the yellow jersey. As it is, he is out of the race. After emerging from the team bus with his arm in a sling Cavendish said: ‘I knew immediately because normally in crashes I bounce back straight away. My shoulder was sticking out the way it shouldn’t. ‘This was the first time in my career that I knew something was up but I wanted to finish, and I was able to do that, but I was in pain. I had some optimism that the swelling would go down overnight but it’s not possible to start today. ‘I’m absolutely devastated. Firstly, the Tour is in the UK for another two days and secondly we have an incredible team.’ Cavendish had accepted responsibility for the crash in a statement on Saturday night. But . he added: ‘I spoke to Simon Gerrans at the finish and then I called him . at his hotel last night too. We both went for Peter Sagan’s wheel but I . wanted that gap so bad but it wasn’t there. ‘I hope Simon is OK and today is a stage for him. He’s a good guy and I wish him well for the rest of the Tour. I’m sorry. ‘I would have loved to have been here for three weeks as we have a really strong team here but the crash was my fault.’ It . is the first time since 2008 —when he left prematurely to prepare for . the Beijing Olympics —that Cavendish will not complete the Tour.

"By . Sami Mokbel . Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM . There's still five months until Christmas, but the Premier League may already have a new pantomime villain on its hands. From what we've seen of Diego Costa since his arrival from Atletico Madrid, watching Chelsea will be pretty entertaining next season. Pushing, shoving, shouting and scoring, Jose Mourinho looks to have found a real live wire in the Spain international. VIDEO Scroll down to watch The best of Diego Costa in a Chelsea shirt... so far . Feisty: Diego Costa (left) got involved in an altercation in Chelsea's 3-1 win against Vitesse Arnhem . Perfect start: Costa managed a goal on his debut for the Blues in a 2-1 victory over Olimpija Ljubljana . It's not hard to understand why he's been billed as the man to finally fill Didier Drogba's boots at Stamford Bridge. He's big, strong, excellent in the air and - above all else - knows where the goal is. Fifty-six goals in two seasons at the Vicente Calderon is testament to that. The fact Drogba has returned to Stamford Bridge shouldn't hinder Costa's transition. If anything, it should help. Who better than the Ivorian - one of the best lone strikers to have played in the Premier League - than to guide Chelsea's £32million investment? Drogba knows the Premier League and its defenders like the back of his hand. That knowledge will prove vital. Of course, Drogba will still want to play as often as possible next season - but he knows his place at Stamford Bridge. Costa's the main man, while Drogba is now the supporting act. Man in charge: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho prefers playing with a lone striker and two attacking wingers . Familiar sight: Costa, pictured here celebrating his first goal, netted 56 times in the last two seasons . That role as a lone centre-forward is vital to the way Mourinho wants his side to play. He tried Samuel Eto'o, Fernando Torres and Demba Ba in the position last season with varying degrees of success. But in Costa, the Special One knows he has someone with the raw materials to lead the line effectively next season. You only have to look at his impact on Atletico last season in a similar role to know Costa can cut the mustard for Chelsea. His bulky 6ft 2ins frame means he is unlikely to suffer at the hands of the Premier League's bully-boys. The way he stood toe-to-toe with Chelsea skipper John Terry during last season's Champions League semi-final first-leg at the Vicente Calderon spoke volumes. Perhaps Terry was testing Costa knowing full well they'd be on the same team a few months later.If it was a test, then Costa passed it with flying colours. He didn't flinch as he eyeballed Terry. Hard man: Costa didn't back down against Chelsea skipper John Terry in last season's Champions League . Main man: Costa looks certain to lead the line for Chelsea next season after arriving for £32million this summer . And eight days later at Stamford Bridge, an all-action display (some might say Drogba-esque) eased Atletico Madrid into the Champions League final with a 3-1 win. If Mourinho needed any persuading over Costa, then that night would have halted any lingering doubts. And now the Portuguese has finally got his hands on the Brazilian-born striker - the man he believes can lead his side to the title. Whether he can emerge from Drogba's shadow and become Chelsea's next great centre-forward remains to be seen. But the ingredients are there, and with Drogba on hand to show him the ropes, everything is in situ for Costa to live up to his £32million price tag. And if he needs any help with living up to his role as a pantomime villain, then his manager knows a thing or two about that.","Costa was involved in an altercation on his second Chelsea appearance .

The England striker has sustained an ankle injury on the club’s tour of New Zealand causing him to miss Wednesday morning’s 2-1 defeat to Wellington.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lacina Traore say playing for Everton was like a dream . Wanted: West Ham are contemplating a move for Monaco striker Lacina Traore for the upcoming season .

And Traore is among the names being considered by West Ham ahead of the new season. The 6ft 8ins striker nearly joined the Hammers in January, but the Ivory Coast star opted to join Everton on loan instead. He scored on his debut for the Toffees against Swansea in the FA Cup on February 16, but sustained a hamstring injury six days later in the warm-up ahead of the clash against Chelsea and missed the rest of the season. Monaco are willing to let the striker, who could also be a target for Everton, leave this summer - a development West Ham are aware of. Carroll’s time at Upton Park has been beset by injury problems, and his latest set-back has led to fears over his long-term fitness ahead of the new season. He made just 16 appearances for the club last season owing to a serious heel injury. West Ham insist he is not expected to miss the start of the new campaign, but Allardyce knows he can ill-afford another year without a proven centre-forward to lead his attack. Carroll’s injury problems, and his lack of options up front, played a key factor in the club’s disappointing 2013/14 campaign - with the Hammers even playing without a recognised centre-forward for some matches. But Allardyce, who has completed deals for forwards Mauro Zarate and Enner Valencia, does not want to fall into the same trap next season and is weighing up a move for a new centre-forward. Out?

It was in Zurich, in October 2007, that Brazil were awarded this World Cup and some 180 miles south of Fifa’s sumptuous headquarters a teenage footballer must have been struck by more than a tinge of excitement. For a then 17-year-old Alexandre Rodrigues da Silva, now better known as Pato, the timing could not have been more perfect. Come the finals in 2014 he would be 24-years-old, and by then the prominent figure in Brazil’s attack. Waste: Pato was on course to become a star for Brazil, but his talent never came to fruition . Fresh-faced: A 17-year-old Pato signing for AC Milan. At that point the world was at his feet . Turnaround: Italian police defend the teenager from adoring fans - now he needs protection from being attacked . Only he is not here in Belo Horizonte preparing for what promises to be a thrilling last 16 encounter with Chile on Saturday night. Seven years on and one of the most exciting forwards in Brazil’s rich history is nowhere to be seen. Fred and Hulk are in the team. Jo, yes Jo, is in the squad. But Pato? He’s out in the cold, ignored by Luiz Felipe Scolari and now in permanent need of two bodyguards to protect him from angry football supporters who it is claimed tried to attack him, together with a couple of team-mates, on the streets of Sao Paulo. It does seem like a scandalous waste of talent. Massimo Franchi, a much respected football writer for the Italian sports newspaper Tuttosport, remembers watching him train at AC Milan’s Milanello training ground around the time of Brazil being awarded the World Cup. ‘He was delicious,’ recalls Franchi. ‘So good.’ Good start: Pato had a strong first few years in Italy, scoring 48 goals in his first 105 games for Milan . Big stage: Pato played regularly for Milan in the Champions League after his big money transfer . Past and future: Pato, here training with selecao legend Ronaldinho, was hailed as the future of Brazilian football . Pato grew up in Pato Branco, a city in western Brazil in the sub-tropical state of Parana. It is from his home town that he gained his adopted name, only leaving Pato Branco to join Internacional in Porto Alegre in June 2006. He would prove an instant success, scoring on his debut inside the first minute and at 17 featuring in the squad that lifted the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup. Better still in the eyes of Internacional fans, he would then score in both legs of the final to secure the club’s first Recopa Sudamericana. Out here in Brazil last week Avram Grant recalled being dispatched to Porto Alegre by Roman Abramovich to recruit Pato for Chelsea. ‘The moment they knew Chelsea were interested they started demanding crazy money, so we walked away,’ said Grant. ‘But boy was he good. So quick. Great feet. Whoosh!’ Instead Pato moved to Milan, signing in August 2007 for close to £20million. Fall from grace: The striker's final years in Italy were blighted by injury limiting his playing time and development . Troubled: The break-down of Pato's marriage to Sthefany Brito after just nine months led to a difficult time . The boss: Pato started dating Barbara Berlusconi soon after the end of his marriage putting a strain on his team . Special Relationship: Even going out with Barbara Berlusconi was not enough to keep Pato's place . Party boy: The striker's wild lifestyle has seen him linked with many women including Debora Lyra, Miss Brazil 2010 . Fifa regulations regarding non-EU minors delayed his debut until the following January, but a goal in a 5-2 defeat of Napoli sparked an immediate sense of excitement . ‘He was incredible,’ says Franchi. ‘Like a Brazilian Messi. We called him the new Zico.’ The new Zico would soon be playing for Brazil too, that devastating combination of pace and skill proving irresistible to Brazil coach Dunga. He scored on his international debut too, against Sweden in March 2008. But if Brazil loved Pato, Pato loved dating some of Brazil’s more glamorous women and this, in the view of many observers, is where some of his problems began. In fairness to Pato, his progress would also be hindered by a series of serious muscular injuries, in particular in his thighs and hamstrings, that would cost him some of that pace. Between 2010 and 2012 he suffered 14 such setbacks with Milan’s doctors blaming a growth spurt of eight centimetres. Forgotten man: Despite making his debut in March 2008, Pato has only played 27 times for his country . But his critics also question if he has always taken the best care of himself. A tempestuous marriage to Sthefany Brito ended in bitter divorce after only nine months, the Brazilian actress citing his unhealthy passion for partying as the reason for their separation. She also threatened him with prison for failing to pay maintenance. But life would become that much more complicated towards the end of 2010  when he then started a relationship with the daughter of his employer, Silvio Berlusconi. Barbara Berlusconi was quite a catch, but she introduced Pato to a life not necessarily conducive to achieving peak sporting performance. ‘Pato suddenly became a member of Milan’s high society,’ says Franchi. The replacements: Hulk (left) Fred (centre) and Oscar (right) now fill the roles that could have been his . Pecking order: Even Jo, so hapless in England, has been preferred to Pato in the Brazil squad . Pato began to mark his goals by making a heart-shaped hand signal towards the directors’ box at the San Siro. The couple would be  photographed in the finest Milan restaurants, at the opera and on the beaches of Sardinia and Rio. ‘In Italy we say he was like a crab,’ says Franchi. ‘As a player he went sideways. He did not make progress.’ Stefano Boldrini, from Gazzetta Dello Sport, agrees, citing ‘health and personal problems’. While his relationship was said to have caused friction in the Milan dressing room, some felt he was being protected by Barbara. She denied this but a deal to bring Carlos Tevez to Milan and sell Pato to Paris St Germain was rumoured to have collapsed in January 2012 because of Barbara’s intervention. In the end, though, not even Barbara could save Pato. He might have scored 48 goals in 105 games in his first three years at the club but in the final two years injuries and a loss of form limited him to 15 appearances and just one goal. Return: Pato left Milan to head back to Brazil, but has failed to make an impact at Corinthians or Sao Paolo . After one match he was even booed by supporters. ‘Milan only sell players when they are finished,’ says Franchi. ‘Look at Shevchenko and Kaka.’ In January 2013 Pato returned to Brazil, to Corinthians in Sao Paulo for a fee of £12million. But that, too, would prove unsuccessful with Pato’s agent claiming the coach, Mano Menezes, wanted him to leave. Comedown: Pato is now on loan at Sao Paolo and despite a few chances could not secure a World Cup squad . At the same time his relationship with Barbara finished, the couple blaming the distance that divided them. Pato’s international career had also stalled by then. Dunga chose not to take him to the 2010 World Cup and six years after that debut he can reflect on just 10 goals from 27 caps. After a decent start to 2013 at Corinthians, Scolari did give Pato opportunities to impress. But the loan move to Sao Paulo in February came amid those reports of a clash with Menezes, the fact that Pato’s career appeared to remain on the same downward spiral convincing Scolari to look elsewhere for strikers.","Precocious 17-year-old has failed to mature into a star .

Jack Wilshere should be giving Arsene Wenger no choice but to make him Arsenal’s next captain. Instead, the talented midfielder is watching the armband drift further and further away. There’s nothing Arsenal fans want more than to see one of their own leading them out on a match day. Because that’s what Wilshere is: a Gooner through and through. The next Tony Adams, if you like. Controversy: Jack Wilshere is caught smoking while on holiday in Las Vegas . I'll drink to that: Jack in the pool at the party during his break in America . But his recent antics in Las Vegas have raised further question marks over his suitability as a future  Arsenal captain. ‘Arsene Wenger has to have a word with Jack and tell him the responsibility he has now got,’ said former Gunners boss George Graham. ‘They were talking about him being a future Arsenal captain, and a captain shouldn’t be acting like that.’ Graham talks from a position of strength. He dealt with the wayward tendencies of ex-skipper Adams during the early part of  the Arsenal legend’s career. He knows what it takes to be an Arsenal captain — on and off the pitch. Trouble brewing? Jack assured Arsene Wenger (left) his last smoking episode was a 'one off' Troubled: Tony Adams (right) battled off-field problems during his time at Arsenal . It’s important to remember, however, that smoking and drinking boisterously in public was more widely accepted in Adams’ era than it is today. You could drink 10 pints, smoke a packet of Benson and Hedges and get away with it in training the morning after. The science involved in modern day football, not to mention the frenzied media attention, means that is no longer the case. On the pitch, Wilshere — who is hugely self-critical of his performances — still has much to learn. Company: James Milner watches his City team-mate Joe Hart dive into the pool . He’ll be the first to admit that. But it is his failure to learn away from the game that is causing Arsenal the biggest headache at the moment. Just what impact his Vegas jaunt has on those gruelling pre-season fitness tests when Wilshere returns to London Colney on Sunday remain to be seen. In reality, while smoking shouldn’t be condoned, a few drags on a cigarette and a few sips of champagne is unlikely to have a huge set-back on his pre-season preparations. But it certainly will not help, of course. Social media has been awash with players posting videos and photographs of themselves topping up their fitness over the summer. Speaking out: Former Gunners chief George Graham has criticised Wilshere's behaviour . When you work in an industry where finding an edge over a rival is paramount, Wilshere — and more importantly, Wenger — knows that edge is not found at the bottom of a champagne glass. ‘Arsene Wenger is the right man to deal with it, he wants a person to not only train well and eat well, but behave well,’ continued Graham on talkSPORT on Tuesday. ‘After the bad publicity shots in the newspapers, somebody has got to have a word with him and I think Arsene Wenger will do. ‘His career has not gone anywhere in the last 18 months. The papers now want any sort of publicity of players misbehaving and he has got to get his act together.’ Having a chat: Man City goalkeeper Joe speaks to his England team-mate in the pool . Wilshere, for so long heralded as the future of Arsenal and England’s midfield, is approaching a critical season. The 22-year-old was meant to be the mainstay of Arsenal’s engine room for the next 10 years. He is now no longer guaranteed a  starting role. He lost his place in the team on various occasions last  season, though foot and ankle  injuries didn’t help his cause. Wenger will be the first admit he is now struggling to find Wilshere a regular place in his team. Aaron Ramsey has surpassed him as the club’s premier central midfielder, while Mikel Arteta, Mathieu Flamini and Tomas Rosicky were all preferred to Wilshere at different junctures last season. Summer signing: The arrival of Alexis Sanchez could restrict Wilshere's chances this season . Wenger’s attempts to sign either Sami Khedira or Lars Bender this summer will make it even harder. Wilshere sometimes found his way into the team last season by  playing on either flank, but the £30million capture of Alexis Sanchez, as well as the pending return to fitness of Theo Walcott, mean even a place out wide is no longer a certainty. Likewise, his position in Roy Hodgson’s plans are no longer crystal clear. At one stage, Wilshere’s position alongside Steven Gerrard in  England’s World Cup midfield looked set in stone. Competition: Wilshere faces a battle for his spot for club and country . But last season’s loss of form, injuries and the emergence of  Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana meant Wilshere played just 17 minutes of England’s opening two games in Brazil, before he was handed a start in the dead rubber against Costa Rica. Like Wenger, Hodgson will not have been amused by the pictures of his great midfield hope living it up in the gambling capital of the world. And, at the moment, Wilshere is gambling with his future.","Former Gunners chief has blasted Wilshere after being pictured smoking .

Mesut Ozil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski won't be able to put their feet up until Sunday night following the World Cup Final. 'I text them to congratulate them on how well they’re doing and just hope that they can go on and win it,' said Arteta. Preparation: Mikel Arteta takes part in Arsenal's first pre-season training session of the summer . 'It must be an unbelievable feeling just to have the chance to play in a World Cup final. 'I’m sure they’re enjoying it and the way they are playing is a joy to watch. It must be really good to be a part of that. 'We’ll be very proud for them if they win it and it will be a big experience for them to win a tournament like that. 'It gives you confidence and another dimension. Hopefully they can do it and bring that spirit back with them to Arsenal. 'That will only strengthen our team and spirit and the ability to win which is the most important thing. 'So I am supporting Germany, absolutely. I would be so happy for these three to win it.' Indeed, having been pilloried an eight season trophy drought, winning is once again becoming a habit at the Emirates Stadium. First there was May's dramatic FA Cup Final win over Hull City  - and now three Gunners are on the brink of winning the biggest prize of all. All the way: Arsenal trio Mesut Ozil (left), Per Mertesacker (right) and Lukas Podolski have reached the World Cup final with Germany . 'When you are under pressure and in a difficult situations and end of up winning that trophy which is something we hadn’t done for a long time, it creates a bit of momentum and belief,' explained the Gunners vice-captain. 'Hopefully this can be the platform for the future. The FA Cup is not enough. For me, I don’t accept that. 'For this club it is not enough and we need to go to bigger challenges now.' Despite their excellent start, there was an air of inevitability when their title challenge faded during the closing stages of last season. Big game: Arteta revealed he has text his German team-mates to wish them good luck for the final . Those humiliating defeats to Liverpool and Chelsea merely underlined just how far the Gunners were from reclaiming their crown as England's top club. But the imminent arrivals of Alexis Sanchez and Mathieu Debuchy will go someway towards helping Arsenal build on their FA Cup success, and perhaps, finally mount a sustained title challenge. 'All the top clubs will be strengthening and it is going to get even more difficult,' said the Spaniard. 'Only one is going to win it and then the other ones who haven’t been good enough are going to get criticised. Staying? The former Everton man has just 12 months left on his Arsenal contract . 'If we start very well again, people will say: ""Arsenal will tire by February or March"". I don’t think that is going to change. 'The only thing that will change that is if we get to that stage and go through it and win it. If we add in the right areas, together with the experience we have now, I think we have a great chance.' But whether Arteta is at the club to play a role in their resurgence remains to be seen. The former Everton man has just 12 months left on his contract and has been offered no guarantees of an extension. He will hold talks with manager Arsene Wenger once the Frenchman returns to the club's London Colney HQ next week. And if the Spaniard has his way, then he'll be at the Emirates beyond his existing contract. New boy: Alexis Sanchez has completed his £30million move from Barcelona to Arsenal . 'I cannot give you an answer at the moment but yes, the manager and I will be in contact and we will decide. 'I don’t know when, sometime soon, we want what is best for everyone. I’m really happy here and I’ve always been happy and grateful to play for this club. 'If I continue doing that I’ll be more than happy. But if I feel I am not productive then there is no point me being here. Gunner: Arsenal midfielder Mikel Arteta (right) has reiterated his intention to extend his stay with the club . 'At this club you are always going to challenge with big players and good players, and I’ve been doing it for the last few years with players in my position and I have no problem with competing with players. 'But if someone comes to me and says: ""Mikel, you’re not going to play anymore, you’re not important"", then with my personality I don’t want to be somewhere they don’t want me, there’s no point in that.

She said: 'Black bears spend a great deal of time sleeping - and since it was a warm day and the cubs were safe, the mum decided it was time for a nap. 'The mum slept most of the time I was there, but one of the cubs seemed very restless. 'The little guy kept waking up, scratching and looking at me before finding another position to lie down. 'The cub seemed so curious and although he was tired, he seemed to be trying to stay awake.' Standing 20 feet away from the tree, Ms Lorenz was able to observe the cub for two hours as he constantly changed his position in a bid to get comfortable. Restless: Ms Lorenz said the bear cub 'kept waking up, scratching and looking at me before finding another position to lie down' Curious: The photographer said the cub 'seemed so curious and although he was tired, he seemed to be trying to stay awake' Black bear cubs remain close to their mother until the age of two or four years old. During this time they learn crucial survival techniques, such as where to find food, how to hunt and defend themselves, as well as where to den. Ms Lorenz said: 'This was such a special sighting for me and I couldn't help laughing at the cub's antics as he sat 15 feet above me.

'It was important to know where I needed to move to once the bears climbed down the tree. You definitely want to make sure that you are not between a bear and her cubs. 'Black bears can move much faster than we can so the key to photographing them safely is to watch for signs that they are nervous and leave when that happens.

'I rushed home to find out more and signed straight up. If I hadn’t done it there and then I never would have got round to it. 'In the first week I lost seven pounds, and the weight kept coming off.' The weight plan involves replacing food with soups and milkshakes to rebuild the relationship with what you're eating. Thanks to her new diet, Emma has lost 6st 5lb. She won the Family Spirit award at the Cambridge Weight Plan awards last year. Not only was the slimmer keen to shed the extra weight, she was also determined to teach her children about a healthy, balanced lifestyle. She explained: 'I didn’t want my kids to see stick thin as healthy, but I didn’t want them to see overweight as healthy either. 'Before I went on the plan we sat and looked at lots of pictures of people and I got them to say who was healthy and who wasn’t, then I asked if they thought I was healthy. 'We never called it a diet, only ""mummy’s healthy eating plan"".' Emma had been overweight for as long as she could remember. She originally lost weight to join the RAF as an engineer in 1999 but it slowly crept back on .","Emma Edward, from Caterton, Oxfordshire, was devastated .

"By . Anthony Bond . Protest: Ministers from the UK are boycotting the initial stages of the Euro 2012 football championship amid anger over the treatment of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko, pictured . The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry are to avoid the Euro 2012 championships in Ukraine amid concerns about the treatment of the opposition leader. Last night St James's Palace confirmed that both of the Royals would not be attending. Their decision follows the news that minsters are to boycott England’s opening Euro 2012 matches over human rights abuses in Ukraine. But the Coalition’s stance was derided as ‘half-hearted’ yesterday after it emerged that ministers may go if England progress to the latter stages. The Foreign Office said it would not send any minister to England’s group-stage matches in protest at the plight of glamorous Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko, who was jailed after a ‘show trial’. All three of England’s group matches take place in Ukraine, which is co-hosting the tournament with Poland. They play France on Monday in Donetsk; Sweden next Friday in the capital Kiev; and Ukraine itself in Donetsk on June 19. Boycott: St James' Place confirmed that both of the Royals would not be attending . However, the Government signalled it would ‘review’ its boycott if England managed to progress to the more glamorous knock-out stages of the tournament, which starts today. Yet if England reach the quarter-finals, the team will have to play in the Ukraine again, raising the question of why the boycott should suddenly be dropped. There is also a one in two chance that an England semi-final would be in the country, while the final is in Kiev. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘No ministers will be attending group games at Euro 2012. Preparations: The England football team are pictured out and about in Krakow, Poland, today ahead of the Euro 2012 championships . Boycott: England will play at the Donbass Arena Stadium in Donetsk in Ukraine during the championship. But no ministers will be attending group stage matches in the country . We are keeping attendance at later stages of the tournament under review in the light of ministers’ busy schedules ahead of the Olympics and widespread concerns about selective justice and the rule of law in Ukraine.’ The Government’s stance was condemned by Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander, who said: ‘The Government should urgently confirm that no UK Government ministers will go on official visits to England matches in the Ukraine at any stage of the tournament in the current circumstances.’ Labour MP Stephen Pound said: ‘They are chicken in Kiev. You can’t put your left leg in, then pull your left leg out and shake it all about. ‘It is half-hearted – not to mention tempting fate – by saying we’re not going to the qualifying games but we will if we reach the final.’ He added: ‘If David Cameron intends to keep sitting on the fence he may as well become a full-time Liberal Democrat.’ Hurt: Ms Tymoshenko was jailed for seven years last year after what supporters claim was a show trial. The former prime minister has accused prison guards of assaulting her and is pictured showing some injuries . Worrying: She claimed that guards punched her in the stomach and twisted her arms and legs while taking her to a hospital against her will . Downing Street followed the lead of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who announced last month that no member of her cabinet would attend any games in the Ukraine. European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and EU justice commissioner Viviane Reding have also both ruled out going.Oleg Voloshyn, foreign ministry spokesman in Kiev, said Britain’s ‘emotional’ decision was regrettable. He said: ‘There are multiple channels to express the British position as far as the Tymoshenko case is concerned. It has already been done in a clear and consistent way. ‘The boycott of the sporting event that has nothing to do with politics is a sign that the British government is inclined to resort to emotional rather than deeply calculated steps. [They] damage football but don’t influence in any positive way the situation with the issue that concerns London.’ Damaging: Other European countries including Germany and France announced that senior politicians would boycott games played in Ukraine unless the human rights situation under President Viktor Yanukovych, pictured, improved . Human rights campaigners have condemned the jailing of Miss Tymoshenko in October. She received a seven-year sentence after what was seen as a show trial and has also gone on hunger strike. Mrs Tymoshenko was a proponent of the Orange Revolution which swept the Ukraine almost a decade ago. She became prime minister in 2007 until the disputed election of 2010, which was won by her rival, Viktor Yanukovych. Mrs Tymoshenko said the results had been rigged. She has since faced a series of corruption and bribery charges in a trial which was condemned by EU leaders. The 51-year-old has also been allegedly abused and beaten in jail. She went on a 20-day hunger strike which ended last month. Her husband, Oleksandr Tymoshenko, has said that the Ukrainian government is slowly killing his wife. Her daughter, Eugenia, said her mother now has severe spinal problems and may be left disabled. She called for Britain to speak out against the Ukrainian government, which she warned was turning into a dictatorship.","St James's Palace said Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry would not attend championships .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . An entrepreneur has launched a website that alerts Christmas shoppers of price cuts on goods. With Cyber Monday just a few hours away, consumers will no doubt find Zeezaw.co.uk a useful money-saving tool. The site uses a series of algorithms to monitor prices on Amazon, telling shoppers when gifts reach a certain price. Users create lists of products they wish to buy and the price they are wiling to pay for them. Best prices: Website Zeezaw.co.uk tracks products on Amazone alerting shoppers when gifts reach a certain price . If that price is ever reached, the consumer will receive an email. Jim McLauchlan,  chief executive of Zeezaw, created the site after he was stung by the world's largest retailer. The businessman, who hopes it will help families struggling this Christmas, bought a DVD boxset, only to find its cost reduced by half a fortnight later. He added: 'In the run-up to Christmas, the last . week of November and first few days of December seem to be the best . time to buy things. 'After . December 15 is a bad mistake — prices start rising because the . retailers know people are rushing to get their final Christmas . presents. 'I thought that if I could get . the computer to watch Amazon for me, monitor the price pattern and alert . me when the price dropped, I could save a lot of money,' he said. An investigation by The Sunday Times showed a dramatic change in prices on the site last December. Money-saving: The site allows users to make lists of their wanted items and how much they wish to pay for them . The newspaper reportedly found on December 1, 2012, a Bob Dylan CD . box was on sale on Amazon for £8.27. It had risen to £23.11 by December . 21, but by January 4 the price had fallen back to £8.27. The investigation found similar difference with numerous other products, including the Game of Thrones series and a Celestron telescope. Amazon said: 'Prices may increase or decrease based on a number of factors. 'However, our commitment is to provide the tens of millions of items available at Amazon for the lowest price possible at any given time.' Last Cyber Monday  - December 3 2012 - Amazon said they saw more than 3.5 million items ordered on their website, at a rate of around 41 items per second. That meant that a delivery lorry packed with Cyber Monday orders left one of Amazon's eight UK fulfilment centres every two minutes and 10 seconds. Retailer: Amazon - one of their warehouses, pictured - sold 3.5 million items last Cyber Monday at a rate of 41 per second . Britons are expected to spend £312,500 every minute during Cyber Monday. A total of £450million is expected to be spent - a 16 per cent increase on the same day last year, a study by John Lewis and Visa Europe showed. There will be 7.7 million online transactions, equating to an average of 320,833 every hour, or 5,437 per minute. Britons are expected to make more than 113 million visits to online stores throughout the day - with many using their last pay cheque before the big day to fund their purchases. Total Christmas sales will be worth £72.2billion, the same as £351 per person, a 2.1 per cent rise on last year the Centre for Retail Research predicts. A third of that total figure will be online, they say. Shoppers will spend a total of 400 million hours shopping online this December, putting it on track to be the biggest ever year for online shopping.","Monitors products on Amazon, alerting shoppers when price of gifts fall .

"By . Hannah Roberts In Rome . Amanda Knox’s former boyfriend has begun a new life in Switzerland, saying that the people there are more ‘discreet’. Putting hundreds of miles between him and Perugia where it all went so wrong for him, Rafaelle Sollecito has relocated to Lugano, in the Italian-speaking southern Alps. The 29-year-old intends to start his own business, a company that helps victims of miscarriages of justice, his father Francesco Sollecito confirmed to the Daily Mail. 'Moving, but not fleeing': Rafaelle Sollecito (left), the former boyfriend of Amanda Knox (right), has started a new life in Switzerland after being told he faces a retrial for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher in Italy . Looking more peace: Rafaelle Sollecito has relocated to Lugano (above), in the Italian-speaking southern Alps, where, he says, the people are more discreet . Sollecito's bags were reportedly packed even before he learnt that he must face retrial for the murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher. Kercher, 21, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was found dead, her throat slashed, in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox in the university town of Perugia. Sollecito and Knox were sentenced to 25 and 26 years respectively for the murder but were freed on appeal two years later, after judges ruled much of the DNA evidence inadmissible. But Italy’s highest court last month quashed the appeal court’s ruling, ordering a retrial. Victim: Kercher, 21, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was found dead, her throat slashed, in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox in the university town of Perugia . Sollecito, said to be crushed by the decision, spent Easter in his home village of Giovinazzo, near Bari, in southern Italy before relocating, hoping he said 'for a quiet life'. He had been granted residence in Switzerland in January. ‘I already had friends in Switzerland and I like the atmosphere here because people, in general, are discreet,’ Sollecito told Italian newspaper Corriere del Ticino. He said he has always been treated well by the Swiss and intends to remain in Lugarno permanently. The engineering and computer science student has not yet finished his degree at the University of Verona, but can complete his studies from his new home. The retrial, in Florence, will probably take place next year, but Sollecito and Knox, who has remained in her hometown of Seattle, are not obliged to attend. Only after the event of a confirmed conviction, in the country’s highest court, would Italy demand they return to finish their prison sentences. But Sollecito has denied suggestions that he was ‘fleeing’ to Switzerland to avoid the retrial and says he intends to come back to fight his cause. The move comes as Knox prepares to release her million dollar memoir which may well include new revelations about her former boyfriend. The publication of her book Waiting to be heard has been cancelled in the UK, but will go ahead in the U.S. on April 30.","Sollecito, 29, has relocated to Lugano in the Italian-speaking southern Alps .

"U.S. President told Congress 'no options off the table' but door remains open to peaceful talks with Tehran . Germany, France and Britain make rare joint statement, warning Iran it would face economic isolation . Tehran remains defiant and says it will block the sensitive oil-important Strait . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 06:59 GMT, 25 January 2012 . Strong words: President Obama used his State of the Union speech in Washington last night to send a message to Iran that the U.S. would keep up the pressure on its disputed nuclear program . President Obama used his State of the Union speech last night to ramp up pressure on Iran after Europe sent battleships to the Gulf. The U.S. President warned Iran that America would focus on its disputed nuclear program with 'no options off the table' but said the door remained open to talks for a peaceful resolution. The President's comments came as European nations sent an international flotilla of . warships, led by U.S. carriers, through the sensitive Strait of Hormuz on Sunday as a 'clear . signal' to Tehran. Iran has threatened to close the strait - through which 35 per cent of the world's tanker-borne oil exports pass - in retaliation for sanctions against its oil exports. In Washington last night, Obama told Congress that Tehran was isolated and facing 'crippling' sanctions that he said would continue so long as the country kept its back turned to the international community. He said: 'America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. 'But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.' When he came to office in 2009, Obama broke with his Republican predecessor George W Bush and offered an olive branch to Iran, saying he wanted a new beginning with the country that Bush had labeled part of the 'axis of evil'. However tensions have escalated over the Iranian nuclear program that Tehran claims is for energy purposes and the West fears is to build a nuclear weapon. In the State of the Union address, which focused mainly on the U.S. economy, Obama also said he was sure that Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad 'will soon discover that the forces of change can't be reversed' and said the U.S. would stand against violence and intimidation in the Middle East and beyond. He also sought to assuage concerns among Jewish voters in the United States about his stance on Israel. 'Our iron-clad commitment - and I mean iron-clad - to Israel's security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history,' the President said. Iran's nuclear program is a major concern for Israel, which has not ruled out a unilateral strike on Iran's nuclear sites. The strong words from President Obama followed a rare joint yesterday where German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Nicolas Sarkozy and British prime minister David Cameron warned Tehran it would face economic isolation unless it abandoned its nuclear ambitions 'immediately'. They added: 'We have no quarrel with . the Iranian people. But the Iranian leadership has failed to restore . international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its . nuclear programme. We will not accept Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon.' Flotilla: The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (left), takes over from the USS John C. Stennis  in the Arabian Sea. The USS Abraham Lincoln later led the convoy through the Strait of Hormuz . The statement, which concluded a day . of intense activity, was backed up by an 'unprecedented' package of EU . sanctions, designed to suck the lifeblood from the regime – including the . ban on importing Iranian oil into Europe. Tehran responded with defiance, with . elements of the ruling regime warning it would shut the strategically . critical Strait of Hormuz – a move that would effectively close the Gulf . to shipping and send oil prices rocketing. The United States has warned Tehran . that closing the Strait, which carries one-fifth of the world's oil . exports, would trigger a massive military response from the West. The . message was underlined at the weekend when Britain, the U.S. and France . sent six warships through the Strait. Mr Cameron said the UK 'will not accept' Iran's bid to develop a nuclear weapon while the country's defence secretary Philip Hammond warned that reinforcements will be available if needed. Mr Hammond was speaking at a press . conference in London following the annual round of talks between UK and . Australian foreign and defence ministers. Australia's foreign minister . Kevin Rudd said his country would enforce the same ban on Iranian crude . oil exports agreed by the European Union yesterday. Under pressure: USS John C. Stennis (L) and USS Abraham Lincoln (R) pictured last week. President Obama said in his State of the Union speech last night that the U.S. would keep at Iran to end its nuclear program . Between them, EU member states import . almost 600,000 barrels a day of Iran's crude oil exports – more than a . fifth of the total. A . ban on exports of gold, precious metals and diamonds from Iran has also . been imposed, along with more economic and travel bans on members of the . hardline regime. Leading figures . in Tehran responded . furiously. Mohammad Kossari, deputy head of the Iranian parliament's . foreign affairs and security committee, said: 'If any disruption happens . regarding the sale of Iranian oil, the Strait of  Hormuz will . definitely be closed.' Senior politician Heshmatollah . Falahatpisheh added: 'In case of threat, the closure of the Strait of . Hormuz is one of Iran's rights.' Sources believe full closure . of the Strait remains unlikely because it would bring 'huge negative . consequences' for Tehran. But they fear Iran could engage in months of . threats and disruption which would ramp up oil prices in the West . without sparking a full military reprisal against Iran. A U.S.-led carrier group passed through the . strait, which is 21 miles wide at its narrowest point. The USS Admiral . Lincoln, an aircraft carrier with a fleet of 90 planes, headed the . group. It was escorted by British ship HMS Argyll, a guided missile cruiser and two . destroyers from the U.S. Navy and a French warship. Threats: Iran has stepped up threats to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of the world's crude oil flows, in retaliation for facing sanctions . Insiders said it was unusual for a . flotilla made up of ships from three separate navies to pass within a . few miles of the Iranian coastline. A defence source rejected suggestions . that it was a provocative move intended to increase pressure on Iran, . adding: 'It is a statement that makes abundantly clear that these are . international waters and all countries need to respect that. This shows . that we are working in partnership and solidarity.' Professor Paul Stevens, a senior . research fellow at the think-tank Chatham House, said he doubted Tehran . would carry out its threat to blockade the strait, for fear of sparking a . 'shooting war' with the U.S. Instead, he said, an oil blockade would . encourage hardliners in Iran to launch a wave of terror attacks. Professor Stevens said an oil blockade . was unlikely to succeed, because Tehran could ship its oil, which makes . up 50 per cent of its revenues, through pipelines to Turkey and Egypt. He added: 'History is littered with failed oil embargoes. However, the . lessons of history appear to have passed by the decision makers of the . EU.' Threat: The USS Abraham Lincoln and USS John C.

"By . Ray Massey . The pilot who was killed when his helicopter hit a crane in central London was urged twice by his client, restaurant-owner Richard Caring, to abandon the planned flight because of bad weather. Even as Pete Barnes, 50, was starting up his engines the client told him on the phone he ‘should not take off’ . But Mr Barnes pressed on regardless while sending a text message to his client saying: ‘I’m coming anyway.’ Scroll down for video . Friends: Restaurant tycoon Richard Caring, left, who owns The Ivy, suggested pilot Peter Barnes postpone the journey to collect him because of poor weather . Up in flames: Half an hour later, Mr Barnes hit a high-rise crane on The Tower at St George Wharf in Vauxhall . The ‘client’ who is not named in the . report is understood to be restaurant tycoon Richard Caring who had . been waiting at Elstree Aerodrome in Hertforsdhire to be picked up and . flown to the north of England and who has spoken already of his . ‘devastation’ at his friend’s death. The pilot was flying from Redhill Aerodrome to Elstree before being diverted to Battersea Heliport in central London. The official AAIB air accident report . shows the client suggested at least twice to the pilot that he should . postpone the journey because of poor visibility. 'At 0718hrs, the client called the . pilot to discuss the weather. The pilot said he thought the weather . might clear earlier than forecast. The client said he would drive to . Elstree and call the pilot to keep him advised. 'At 0731hrs, having noticed how poor . the weather was during his journey, the client called the pilot to . suggest that he did not take off until he (the client) had reached . Elstree and observed the weather. Up in flames: Despite his client advising him not to fly, Mr Barnes took and off and hit a high-rise crane on The Tower at St George Wharf in Vauxhall . The damaged crane on St George's Tower in Vauxhall, shortly after the crash, was shrouded in fog . The pilot replied that he was already starting the engines. 'The client stated that he repeated his suggestion that the pilot should not take off,' the report said. Details of text messages sent and received by the pilot have also been revealed. At 6.30am he told the client: . 'Weather OK up north but freezing fog at Elstree and Luton not clearing . between 8-10am I've got same at Redhill keep you posted.' He sent the client another message at 7.29am which stated: 'I'm coming anyway will land in a field if I have to.' The pilot had been on his way to pick up restaurant and clubs tycoon Richard Caring, 62, when the crash happened. Mr Caring was waiting at Elstree airport in Hertfordshire when the helicopter diverted to Battersea because of fog. The helicopter disintegrated, killing Mr Barnes and a pedestrian, after it collided with the crane . Aftermath: Debris lies on the ground after the helicopter crashed into a construction crane in central London . Mr Caring, who runs a string of . restaurants such as the Ivy and Annabel's, as well as the world-famous . Wentworth golf course, had been waiting to be taken to Yorkshire on . business. He said last week: 'I flew with Pete Barnes for many years. 'He was a very dear friend and a . very  accomplished pilot. My thoughts and prayers are  with his family . during this awful time. I am devastated for their loss.' A friend of the businessman said at . the time: 'On the morning of the accident he was waiting at the airfield . but was not aware the pilot had diverted. 'He is very upset by what had happened.' Another . pilot, who was aware of the journey planned by Mr Barnes, sent him a . message which read: ‘Give me a call as I have checked weather and . freezing fog around at the moment.' Warning: Pilot Pete Barnes decided to fly his plane despite the bad weather even if it meant ' landing in a field' Mr . Barnes was on his way to collect his client when he was forced to . change his route because of the bad weather. His final conversation was . with air traffic control seven seconds before the crash. Mr Barnes requested to land at London Heliport in Battersea. He asked: ‘Is Battersea open, do you know?’ After being told the heliport was open, he replied: ‘If I could head to Battersea that would be very useful.’ Victim Matt Wood, who was described by his sister Amanda as a 'big guy with a big heart'. His inquest is yet to take place . Just . 15 seconds before hitting the crane, air traffic control told the . pilot: ‘Battersea diversion approved, you're cleared to Battersea.’ His final words were: ‘Thanks a lot.’ The . AAIB report stated: ‘This exchange ended at 0759.18 when G-CRST (the . helicopter) was approximately 150 metres south-west of Vauxhall Bridge. 'Immediately . afterwards the helicopter began to turn right. At 0759.25 it struck a . crane on the south side of the river 275 metres from the south-west end . of Vauxhall Bridge.’ The . initial ‘special bulletin’ report by the AAIB also suggested that the . solar-powered red warning lights on top of the crane were not switched . on during the crash because the official requirement was that ‘the . obstacle be lit at night only.’ It notes: ‘The crane was lit at night with red lights, both on its tower and jib.’ ‘The tower lighting consisted of mains-powered steady red lights at approximately 50m intervals. ‘The jib lighting was provided by solar-powered lights. ‘The . Air Navigation Order requires the lighting to be of medium intensity . (2000 candela) and that the obstacles be lit at night only.’ But an official ‘notice to airmen’ warning had been issued about the structure. Mr . Barnes, a father of two from Berkshire, had 25 years' flying . experience. He had flown as an air ambulance pilot and in several films . during his career, including Oscar-winning Saving Private Ryan and Tomb . Raider II. Pedestrian Mr Wood, from Sutton, Surrey, died from severe burns and a leg injury. The Air . Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report today revealed the last . words of pilot Pete Barnes as he talked to air control moments before . his helicopter crashed into a high-rise crane in Vauxhall at 8am on . January 16. Here is an edited transcript of what was said: . At 07.56am, pilot Pete Barnes requested to land at Battersea Airport, asking air control: 'Is Battersea open do you know?' He then added: 'If I could head to Battersea that would be very useful.' The controller replied: 'I'll just have a chat with them, see what their cloud is looking like.' The helicopter was flying south parallel to the River Thames and, as it passed Westminster Bridge, began to descend. At 07.58am hrs, the controller said: 'Battersea are just trying to find out if they can accept the diversion.' The pilot acknowledged, after which the controller continued: 'And you can make it quite a wide hold, you can go as far as London Bridge.' The helicopter crossed the north bank of the Thames at 1,000 ft heading south-west and began a right turn. It was by now level at approximately 800 ft and altered course to follow the line of the river east towards Vauxhall Bridge. At 07.59.10am the ATC controller said: 'Battersea diversion approved. You're cleared to Battersea.' The pilot replied: 'Lovely thanks' before adding: ' Thanks a lot'. The exchange ended at 07.59:18, when the helicopter was approximately 150m south-west of Vauxhall Bridge, and just seconds before it hit the crane on The Tower at St George Wharf. The report details how the helicopter disintegrated after it collided with the crane, which was shrouded in fog. It . writes: 'The collision with the crane’s jib resulted in separation of . the main rotor blades from the rotor head, and the rotor head and main . gearbox from the fuselage of the helicopter. 'The cockpit airframe structure was also damaged. 'The main rotor head and gearbox landed separately from the fuselage and were further damaged by the impact with the ground. 'The . tail section of the helicopter detached from the tail boom as the . helicopter made contact with a building, before the fuselage struck the . ground. 'The ground . impact caused further extensive damage and the majority of the fuselage . wreckage was consumed by a post-impact fire.' The report comes after a crane driver today claimed he had been worried a helicopter would hit the high-rise structure months before the accident occurred. Fears: The crane driver, who did not want to be named, said he was worried about an aircraft hitting the crane before the crash happened . He said one occasion he could almost see the eyes of some pilots as they . came so close to the crane above the River Thames. He added: 'It was very close. It was difficult to tell . how close they were but you could almost see the whites of the pilot’s . eyes.' 'When the first one came by I had no idea what it was. There was the sudden loud noise and it whipped right passed the cab. 'They . came by pretty frequently and it was a bit worrying. It made you jump . and it was certainly close enough that you worried the crane could be . hit.'

"By . Lucy Waterlow . The heroics of the men who fought valiantly to take Sword, Gold and Juno beaches on D-Day will never be forgotten but the stories of those who died are less well-remembered. Now letters written by men preparing for D-Day and who didn't make it home are to be brought to life in a poignant documentary made to mark the 70th anniversary of the landings. Among the accounts to appear on ITV's If I Don't Come Home - Letters from D-Day is the story of Captain Norman Skinner, 38, from Hillingdon in London. Fallen heroes: Rifleman Glenn Dickin, left, was shot while Captain Norman Skinner, right, was killed by a bomb . Ahead of the assault on Normandy beaches, . which would help mark the beginning of the end of World War Two, Captain Skinner wrote to his wife of eight years with whom he had two young daughters, . Ann and Jane. 'As you know anything may happen at any moment and I cannot tell when you will receive this,' he noted. 'All the things I intended to say must be written.' The former insurance worker confessed to feeling nervous ahead of the battle but said morale was high. 'I'm . not a dashing hero by any means but the influence of everyone around me . and the confidence of all the troops has made me lose any early fear . which I expected,' he added. 'Whether it will last until the final moment I can't . tell. I'm sure anyone with with imagination must dislike the thought of . what's coming but my fears will be more of being afraid than of what can . happen to me.' Apprehension: Many of the soldiers writing home confessed to being nervous at the thought of D-Day . The most moving parts of Captain Skinner's letters come as he tells his wife just how much she meant to him and how much he loved the life they shared. 'You and I have had some lovely happy years that now . seemed to have past at lightning speed but I, and I'm sure you as well, . can look back on them with some kind of contentment, knowing that in our . love and need of each other, we have injured no-one,' he said. 'Although I would give anything to be back . with you, I have not had any wish to back down from the job we have to . do. ...'Although I would give anything to be back . with you, I have not had any wish to back down from the job we have to . do' 'There is so much I mean to tell you, much of what you have . heard before, but I mean it even more today. 'I shall always be grateful . to the powers above for having been able to be with you, to have been . loved by you. I'm sure I will be with you again soon and for good. Give . my fondest love to my Ann and my Janey.' Sadly Captain Skinner never made it home to his beloved family. Instead, they were sent a telegram informing them he had been killed by a direct hit from an enemy bomb which fell on a dugout he was sheltering in on the beach. Remember them: Thousands of brave men from the UK, US and the Commonwealth died on D-Day . Another soldier writing home to tell his family how much he loved them was Canadian farmer's son, Rifleman Glenn Dickin, 22. 'As usual there isn't much news but I am . getting along fine and I'm well,' he wrote in a cheerful letter to his parents ahead of the attack on Juno Beach. 'I suppose all the spring work on the . farm is in full progress. So you still haven't had the veranda painted? I . guess I'll have to get at it when I get back.' But he never made it home. Although Rifleman Dickin survived the beach landing, he was shot down during an intense firefight further inland. Brave: Captain Alastair Bannerman kept a journal of his experience of D-Day and capture by the Germans . His mother received a letter from . the regimental chaplain which explained: 'I am going to tell you the . circumstances of his death, I think you would like to know them. 'Glenn . (and two others in his regiment) went to the top of a hill next to the . church, within a few minutes of their arrival they were heavily shelled . by enemy artillery and all three were killed.' The chaplain then relates that when the bodies of the men were recovered, he and others in the regiment were moved to see they had been covered in flowers by French locals who were grateful to the soldiers for giving their lives to liberate them. As letters from the front line often took time to be sent, Glenn's last letter to his parents actually arrived after they had received the news of his death. His parting words were: 'Don't you be worrying too hard about me. I'm a pretty capable . person, don't worry about me.' Meanwhile, Morris Hardstaff, 22, a factory worker from Yorkshire, wrote from the engine room of a air-sea rescue craft to his young wife Dot. 'I would like you to know just how I feel in this great adventure,' he wrote. But he added: 'I'm fully aware that you may never read it. You only will if I hand deliver it as it won't pass the censor.' Happily for Dot, Morris was one of the lucky men who made it home and was able to deliver his letter to her in person. Another lucky soldier was Captain Alastair Bannerman, of the 2nd Battalion of . the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, who was married with two small children. '...My love was with you when you needed it most, you have been very close to me this whole time' He kept a journal of his experiences so he could share them with his wife Elizabeth. Three days . before D-Day, not knowing exactly what lay ahead, he wrote: 'This morning this made me feel quite desperate… . 'I felt . a little empty. I am waiting so impatiently for news from you of . yourself and my small sons, more than ever before in my life I am . longing for you and if I am not able to send any letters at least I can . write what I have to say in this little book and so express my . emotions.' Once ashore, he led his men in an . assault on a wood, the brutality and panic of which he later described in harrowing detail. 'Suddenly an 88 got our range and up went our . carrier in a deafening explosion with all our ammunition, knocking us . all sideways. 'There was nothing for it but to crawl - ""Sauve qui peut,"" I . shouted. Everyone for himself. Good luck. And the next few minutes I . felt were my last.' Unto the breach: U.S. troops wade ashore at Omaha Beach during the Normandy D-Day landings . Captain Bannerman was later declared missing in action and his family had an agonising wait to see if he had survived. But he had in fact been captured by the Germans - and never knew why they didn't shoot him when they had the chance. Once the Allies were victorious, he was able to write to Elizabeth and tell her that he was alive and well. She wrote back to him telling of her joy. 'I was so lucky to have my anxiety relieved. I can't describe what this has meant to me,' she wrote. 'I have been to church to be thankful for this miracle. 'My love was with you when you needed it most, you have been very close to me this whole time, let us say that is the ticket.' She added: 'My darling keep going, au revioir, god bless, I love you.' He eventually returned home in 1945 and the couple had a third son. During the ITV documentary, Captain Bannerman's son returns to France to retrace his father's footsteps. The show also uses archive footage and speaks to veterans who lived to tell the tale. One veteran, Tom Knight, said: 'I was glad I was there and twice as glad to get back. It was an experience I wouldn't have liked to have missed because there were some good times as well as bad times.'

"By . Margot Peppers . and Lucy Waterlow . A lot may have changed in the last century but it seems one thing hasn't - a woman's quest for eternal youth and the bizarre lengths she'll go to in order to look younger. Today women will try vampire facials and dermarollers to banish wrinkles. But a book has revealed that in Edwardian times they had less sophisticated beauty methods but still believed in no pain, no gain. In Health and Beauty Hints, a 1910 book by Margaret Mixter, recently unearthed on Archive.org, the author emphasises the importance of keeping skin firm and tightened, especially around the face and neck. She recommends vigorous self-massage and various oils and creams. Edwardian beauty regime: A book from 1910 recommends vigorous self-massage to banish a double chin . Miracle weightloss cure: The author believes the technique will also give you thin arms . Massage was also recommended to reduce swollen eyelids, left, while tinting eyebrows and lashes was in fashion just like today . 'It is a fact always to be remembered . that the tendency of flesh on the face is to droop downward with age,' she writes. 'So . all muscles and cords must be rubbed up, to prevent their stretching.' A . photo demonstrating how this is done shows a woman in an elaborately . ruffled nightgown sitting in front of a sink, her palms rubbing against . each cheek. The caption reads: 'Face massage, showing upward stroke on cheek - must be hard'. At . night, Mixter recommends applying a mixture of almond oil, white wax, . lanoline, elderflower water, witch hazel and spermaceti - a wax made . from the head cavities of sperm whales. Application . is different depending on your face shape, however. 'Rub gently to . increase the flesh and make the cheeks round,' she says. Alternatively, 'If a double chin or superfluous flesh is to be removed, rub vigorously to wear away the fat by friction.' Outdated: Health and Beauty Hints, a 1910 book by Margaret Mixter, contains odd tips like massaging the face with a mixture containing spermaceti - a wax made from the head cavities of sperm whales . Soft skin: One of the seemingly older pieces of advice is eradicating wrinkles by using adhesive plaster . Not a modern idea: Women a century ago had their own form of dry shampoo . Another way to maintain clear skin, according to this 1910 beauty expert, was by embracing the elements. 'Even in extreme cases shampooing is not to be done oftener than once in three weeks' 'Walking in the rain, for persons who are not susceptible to cold, is an excellent tonic for the complexion,' she writes. Surprisingly, modern celebrity make-up artist Rachel Wood - whose clients have included Rosario Dawson and Vanessa Hudgens - told MailOnline that this advice 'wasn't that far off'. 'Today the closest thing would be to probably give your face a good steam!' she said. When it comes to haircare, it appears women in the early 1900s were equally averse to over-washing - although the period they could tolerate between shampoos was significantly longer. 'Even in the extreme cases of exudation shampooing is not to be done oftener than once in three weeks,' Mixter advises. Staying youthful: 'By the time a woman is twenty-five years old she should devote at least ten minutes, night and morning, to massaging her throat under the chin,' she writes . Excess grease, like today, was dealt with by using a sort of dry shampoo. 'Should the hair become heavy with grease during the intervening weeks much of it can be removed by sprinkling the locks thickly with fine corn meal,' she says. The cornmeal is then 'brushed out after absorbing the dirt, with a long but soft-bristled brush.' Mixter writes that being in the sun gives 'tone and vigor' to hair, 'and to dry one's hair in the sun after washing it is ideal'. She takes it a step further when she writes just how essential sunshine is. 'So important do . I regard this treatment that I consider it an error to wash the hair on . a damp or cloudy day,' she writes. And her views on brushing your hair before bed were apparently non-negotiable. 'I believe that it is impossible for a girl to have pretty hair, and I know that she cannot possess luxuriant tresses when an old woman, unless she brushes and combs her tresses before going to bed,' she asserts. Unlikely method: 'If a double chin or superfluous flesh is to be removed, rub vigorously to wear away the fat by friction' In order to ensure a strong head of hair in old age, she advises 'at least twenty long strokes of the brush after all snarls have been removed with a comb'. Physical exercise, she wrote, could be done to benefit both the complexion and the figure - a statement that still holds true to this day. 'Exercises must be taken before an open window to clear the complexion' But the manner in which women were advised to exercise - and the clothes in which they carried out these routines - are a true mark of the times. 'An excellent . garment to wear when going through these movements is a light flannel . dressing sacque that will give warmth without impeding the freedom of . movement,' writes Mixter. 'I mention this article of wearing apparel because the . exercises must be taken before an open window to clear the complexion, . and if one is not properly clad, the flesh might become chilled,' she explains . 'Felt or . woolen slippers must also be worn,' she adds, presumably to similarly avoid 'chilled flesh'. Keep fit: Women were told to touch their toes to keep their waistline small... and do the housework . Nailcare: While some of the 'hints' are undoubtedly undated, others have held true to this day - like trimming cuticles when giving yourself a manicure . An activity she recommends for keeping fit and 'developing the figure' is housework, like sweeping, dusting and washing. 'Housework is excellent exercise for a girl who wishes to develop a round, pretty figure,' she says, 'for [it] helps to strengthen . and beautify the body.' She goes on to elucidate how a woman should hold back her shoulders and bend at the waist while carrying out household chores to get the most benefit out of it.","Health and Beauty Hints was written in 1910 .

"By . Mark Duell . Claiming: Linda Kozlovska, 32, was paying a reported £100-a-week rent for her old home . in Lincolnshire . A Latvian mother-of-ten receiving £34,000-a-year benefits has won her fight for a bigger taxpayer-funded home - worth three times the value of her current property, it emerged today. Linda Kozlovska, 32, is moving her family from their £48,000 three-bedroom property in Boston, Lincolnshire, to a town in South Yorkshire where the average house costs around £150,000. The single self-employed cleaner’s new rented home is believed to have four bedrooms and be located near a town centre, reported The Sun. But the family's move prompted calls for welfare system reform that would ensure taxpayers ‘are not funding a lifestyle for claimants that they couldn't afford for themselves’. Miss Kozlovska told the newspaper: ‘We are very happy here, but I don't want to say any more.’ And one of her neighbours in Boston told the Sun: ‘She is Latvian like me and she told me that she had got herself a house in Yorkshire. ‘She sounded very pleased with herself. I don't know how she did it but I wish I knew.’ Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of campaign group the TaxPayers’ Alliance, told MailOnline: ‘Our welfare system is in urgent need of repair. ‘Families up and down the country make decisions about where they live and whether to have more children every day. 'So, taxpayers cannot keep being asked to pick up increasingly large bills to subsidise bigger houses for claimants. ‘It's time that the welfare system was reformed to protect taxpayers, by ensuring that they are not funding a lifestyle for claimants that they couldn't afford for themselves.’ MailOnline first reported on the case of Miss Kozlovska in September 2012, four years after she had arrived in Britain with three of her children in 2008. She admitted at the time that she was unhappy living in the Boston property - because she had had three more children and four others had moved over from Latvia. ‘I have ten children living here with me,’ she said last year. ‘I’m the only adult. I am on the council waiting list, but we’re still here. Home: Miss Kozlovska is moving her family from their £48,000 three-bedroom property in Boston (pictured) Upkeep: The backyard of the three-bedroom Boston house has cracked paving and furniture sacked outside . 'They don’t have a big enough house. I want a bigger house. I don’t like it here. When we moved in it had bed bugs.’ The council had appeared to be supporting her, with one councillor saying last year that he was ‘sympathetic’ to her demands. Miss . Kozlovska paid £100 in rent a week to a private landlord for the house . in Boston, which was managed by the local borough council. She . was claiming working tax credits, child tax credits and child benefits. Every week, she received £527 in child tax credit and working tax . credit as well as £127 in child benefits. In total, she received £34,000 a year from the state – far more than the average UK salary of just over £26,000 before tax. Plea to move: Writing on the wall of the Boston home. Miss Kozlovska said when she moved in it had bed bugs . Street view: Miss Kozlovska privately rented the house in Boston. A general view of the road is pictured . The amount is also much higher than the £9.26 per child she would have received each month if she were still living in Latvia. There, couples can claim up to £1,865 per baby, but payments dip after children reach 18 months. Miss Kozlovska lives with Russandra, 17, Liene, 14, Julian, 13, Sandija, 12, Marko, . nine, Janis, seven, Diana, six, Rolands, three, and twins Edvard and . Alan, two. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We are working hard to restore fairness to the welfare state. 'The benefit cap will mean claims are limited to the average household income of £500 a week and people have a clear incentive to get into work and back on their own two feet. 'Housing benefit changes now stop massive claims. A safety net is firmly in place, but claimants cannot have rents paid that are well out of reach for hard-working families.'","Linda Kozlovska was paying £100-a-week for three-bed Boston home .

"By . James Chapman . Chis Grayling has faced criticism even from his own party over the scheme . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is under pressure to reverse a ban on books being sent to prisoners which has been branded ‘unenlightened’ by senior Tory colleagues. The restriction on reading material being sent to prisoners by family and friends is part of a new ‘incentives and earned privileges’ regime introduced by the Ministry of Justice. The scheme has caused uproar among writers and civil liberties groups - one of which likened it to measures seen at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. They argue there should be no restrictions on access to books in prisons, supposed to be places of rehabilitation and education. Even senior Conservatives who . normally back Mr Grayling’s hardline approach are uneasy. One senior . Tory minister said: ‘Chris Grayling wins the prize for the Government’s . least enlightened minister. He has no backing for this from any quarter . at all.’ The . Justice Secretary insisted last night that parcels being sent into . prisons had been a vehicle for ‘contraband’ and there were not enough . staff to check them all properly. He insisted prisoners could access . books from jail libraries and could purchase more using money earned by . working inside. ‘Parcels . are an obvious conduit for getting drugs into prisons. If we allowed . all prisoners to have access to parcels from home, it would be an . impossible volume of post to go through systematically,’ Mr Grayling . said. The move is part of a bigger shift towards an 'incentive and earned privileges' regime introduced by MoJ . ‘What we have done is set out rules that say when people can have parcels from home. The idea that we are banning access to books for prisoners is frankly ridiculous. ‘All prisoners can have up to 12 books in their cell, and all prisons have libraries which prisoners have access to. They can buy any book they want to with their prison earnings, with the approval of prison staff.’ But Clare Algar, executive director of legal charity Reprieve said: ‘This move is reminiscent of the heavy-handed measures we have seen at Guantanamo Bay - where the US authorities have banned a wide range of books, from John Grisham to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. ‘It is deeply disturbing to see Chris Grayling now taking his lead from one of the world’s most notorious prisons.’ Frances Crook, the director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said banning books being sent to prisons was ‘despicable and nasty’. ‘The rules governing possessions of prisoners are arcane and not consistently applied by every prison. These new restrictions relate to a downgrading of the system of rewards and punishments, ostensibly designed to encourage prisoners to comply with prison rules. Ian Rankin, left, and Mary Beard, right, are two big names who have come out against the new prison scheme . ‘If the Ministry of Justice allows prisoners to be sent credit from outside, then why on earth would they ban friends and family from sending in books and insist instead that prisoners must buy the books themselves? ‘Almost all a prisoner’s weekly allowance would be spent on just one title. Even the most ardent book lovers tend not to spend all of their weekly wage on what they read. ‘It is common for prisoners to spend 20 hours a day in their cells during the week. At weekends they can be cooped up from Friday lunchtime until Monday morning. Being able to read a book is a lifeline and a way of nourishing the mind.’ Prisons in Brazil offer inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by reading books. Inmates in four federal jails earn four days off their time inside for every book they read, meaning they would have to work their way through 12 to trim a maximum 48 days off their sentence each year. They are given up to four weeks to read a book and write an essay on it, which must ‘make correct use of paragraphs, be free of corrections, use margins and legible joined-up writing’. An expert panel determines which inmates are eligible to participate. She insisted prison libraries were not a satisfactory alternative as they were run by local authorities, many of which were now seeking to cut costs. TV historian Professor Mary Beard said: ‘I am with the excellent Howard League on this one. It just can’t be a sensible idea. Books educate and rehabilitate.’ Author Ian Rankin said: ‘From visits to prisons and talking to prisoners, I know how important books can be in promoting literacy and connecting prisoners to society.’ Labour’s shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said if the Government wanted to rehabilitate prisoners it ‘would be encouraging reading, not making it more difficult than it already is’. ‘Half of all male prisoners have no qualifications and the number of those in jail who can’t read and write is a national disgrace. Two-fifths of all prisoners have the average reading age of an 11-year-old,’ he added. ‘This ridiculous policy shows just how low Chris Grayling has plumbed the depths in his approach to running our justice system.’ The new regime prevents prisoners being sent parcels, previously allowed at the discretion of jail governors, except in exceptional circumstances such as for provision of medical supplies. Reform campaigners say that as well as books, other items, such as underwear and stationery, are being restricted. Inmates have to buy items from prison shops instead. Prisons minister Jeremy Wright said: ‘Under the incentives and earned privileges scheme, if prisoners engage with their rehabilitation and comply with the regime they can have greater access to funds to buy items, including books.’","Even senior Tories have criticised Chris Grayling's hardline approach .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . The BBC sent 140 crew members to cover Nelson Mandela's memorial despite receiving more than 1,000 complaints over its 'excessive' coverage of his death. The number of staff dedicated to the iconic leader's death was far greater than its rivals, including ITV which reportedly despatched just nine staff to South Africa. News of the figures emerged as nearly 1,500 viewers complained that local news was being sidelined in favour of coverage of Mr Mandela's death, including some who grumbled about a repeat of Mrs Brown's Boys being interrupted. Too much? Barack Obama gives his eulogy at Nelson Mandela's memorial service as seen on the BBC, which has sent 120 staff to cover the late South African leader's death . The number of BBC staff sent to South Africa was far greater than its rivals, including ITV which reportedly despatched just nine crew to cover proceedings . The BBC has defended . the extent to which it featured the death of the former South African . president, a major news item which led bulletins around the world. By . yesterday, the corporation had received 1,350 complaints about too much . coverage across its news services, with some saying the emphasis had . reduced the coverage of severe weather across the UK that day. The . BBC has defended its coverage and said Mandela's death was of . 'considerable interest' to audiences in the UK and across the rest of . the world. A spokeswoman . for the BBC told the Daily Telegraph: 'Over a ten-day period, we expect . to have deployed around 120 journalists, technicians and support staff . to work on this huge international story.

Hundreds of world leaders including President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro were joined by thousands of ordinary South Africans and Mr Mandela's family to pay tribute to the anti-apartheid hero at the FNB football stadium today. Mr Obama led the tributes by calling Mr Mandela a 'giant of history'. Mr Obama opened his speech by thanking Mandela's family, then continued: 'To the people of South Africa - people of every race and walk of life - the world thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us. 'His struggle was your struggle. His triumph was your triumph. Your dignity and hope found expression in his life, and your freedom, your democracy is his cherished legacy.' The U.S. President compared Mr Mandela’s actions to those of Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln and US civil rights leader Martin Luther King but also warned against viewing Mr Mandela as detached from normal life. 'He was not a bust made of marble, he was a man made of flesh and blood,' he told the crowds in the stadium including leaders from more than 90 countries gathered at the stadium.","ITV has sent just nine staff to cover iconic leader's death in South Africa .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Jason Groves . High demand: Planning Minister Nick Boles warned 100,000 new homes will be built to accommodate the expanding British population . A plan to build on two million acres . of countryside to solve Britain’s housing crisis has made planning . minister Nick Boles a Tory ‘hate figure’, it was claimed today. The outspoken minister, promoted by . David Cameron in this autumn’s reshuffle, claimed ‘another 2 to 3 per . cent of land’ needed to be developed to meet soaring demand for housing . fuelled by immigration. But Tory MP Bob Stewart revealed voters in his Beckenham constituency are furious at the idea, . insisting homes should be built on brownfield sites which have been . developed before. Last week Mr Boles said migrants accounted for almost . half of the housing demand, and his figures suggest 100,000 new homes a . year will be needed to accommodate them. The minister added: ‘We can’t . go on like this.’ He alarmed . conservationists by saying up to two million acres of green fields may . have to be concreted over to deal with the housing shortage. Now he is at risk of sparking a Tory revolt among MPs with rural constituencies and voters who do not want to see more development. Mr Stewart told The Times: ‘Boles is rapidly becoming a hate figure. ‘They would much prefer building on brownfield sites.’ Mr Boles is the first government minister to draw a clear link between housing demand and the legacy of Labour’s open-door immigration policy. He said: ‘The fact is – and I am critical of the last government’s immigration policies – we allowed the population of this country to expand dramatically. ‘The population of England has gone up by two million in the last ten years. These people now live here, these people are now British and they need homes just like other British people. ‘The fact is, 43 per cent of the new households which want a home, is accounted for by immigration. ‘We can’t go on like this. We need to have less immigration and more house-building and we might then have a civilised country.’ Mr Boles warned the scale of demand . meant large swathes of countryside would have to be sacrificed, because . there were not enough empty homes or developed sites. But conservationist have accused him of advocating unnecessary development of irreplaceable beauty spots. Sue Holden, chief executive of the . Woodland Trust, said: 'Mr Boles does not only ignore existing land . availability, he fails to recognise that some aspects of nature are . irreplaceable. 'Unlike new buildings, ancient . woodland cannot be recreated. We are told by the Government that . economic growth and environmental enhancement can go hand in hand but . this kind of statement does little to promote confidence in its . commitment to a balanced approach.' At risk: With a lack of both empty homes and developed sites where new homes could be built, Green Belt land may have to be sacrificed . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said . last month that the number of households was forecast to expand at the . rate of 230,000 a year. The figure supplied by Mr Boles suggests that . immigration will account for almost 100,000 of the total. Mr . Clegg said total house building amounted to just 117,000 last year, . adding: ‘There’s only one way out of this housing crisis: We have to . build our way out.’ Mr Boles angered conservationists by suggesting the total area of land under development should be increased by a third to ease the housing shortage. He said ministers would protect the Green Belt, but warned that large areas of ‘open land’ may have to be given over for housing. And he hit out at developers for building ‘pig ugly’ housing estates that deter communities from accepting any new development. ‘We’re going to protect the Green Belt but if people want to have housing for their kids they have got to accept we need to build more on some open land,’ Mr Boles said. ‘In the UK and England at the moment we’ve got about 9 per cent of land developed. All we need to do is build on another 2 to 3 per cent of land and we’ll have solved a housing problem.’ The National Trust accused Mr Boles of making up figures ‘on the back of a fag packet’, while the Campaign to Protect Rural England said his proposals were a licence to developers to ‘let rip’.","Call to build on 'another 2 to 3% of land' sparks backlash from Conservative voters .

Weather reports had a high of 89 with 89 per cent humidity, which meant it felt more like 94 degrees. The boys were all wearing full pads, according to TC Palm. In a 911 recording, a coach reported that a player needed medical assistance for 'heat issues' and that he had vomited. The dispatcher asked if the boy was conscious. The coach said he was. 'They've got water on him, trying to cool him down,' the coach said. The ninth-grader was taken to Shands Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. 'Coaches are at the hospital and coaches are also at the camp/base with the teammates,' said Mary Justino, a sheriff's office spokeswoman. Cut short: The Sebastian River High School football team returned from camp early following Shogran's death. Grief counselors were on-hand for staff and students . Bill Fritz, an official with the Indian River County School District, said members of the team were heading back to the high school and that grief counselors were being made available. 'The school district and Sebastian River High School communities are deeply saddened by this news,' Fritz said in a statement. According to TC Palm, a autopsy results could take up to six months. The boy's distraught mother Maria Wray said her son had been excited for football camp and to be playing for the local school's team. She told WJXT that her son loved his XBox and reading comics. 'Hug your kids all the time and tell them that you love them,' Wray said.","William Shogran, Jr collapsed at a Florida football camp .

"By . Alex Finnis For Mail Online . The body of a woman whose daughter promised would be buried beside her late husband has been found four years later - mummified and decaying in her home in Gilbert, Arizona. Janet Pallone Delatorre found her 98-year-old mother Josephine Pallone dead in her bed in September 2010, and told her son that she would be buried in Chicago. But now her remains have been found still in that very same same bed, in what police have described as a rubbish-filled 'hoarder house' on Leah Lane. Scroll down for video . The Gilbert, Arizona 'hoarder house', where Josephine Pallone's body has lay rotting for four years . Video courtesy of Towson University . A police report says: 'Janet stated she ""panicked"" and believed police would think Janet killed her based on the condition of the house. Janet assumed the police would think Janet neglected her and that is why she died.' For this reason, she bizarrely decided to leave her mother where she had found her, and she remained there until police discovered her gripping an old blanket on June 28. They said it was obvious that she had been dead for a very long time. Police made the gruesome discovery because Ms Pallone Delatorre's ex-husband, William Delatorre, had gained control of the house through the courts, after she had fallen behind on payments. Acting as a court commissioner, a real estate agent went into the house to find it in awful condition. Concerned, police searched the house to find it full of rubbish, with clothes stacked in piles in many of the rooms, and Mrs Pallone's remains in one of the bedrooms. They also found a pet bird, which was in healthy, cared-for condition. Ms Pallone Delatorre's son Nathan told police he had moved out of the house four years ago to go to university, and not long after had been told by his mother over the phone that his grandmother had died. He said he had not been to the house since, but had been told that his mother's plan had been to bury Mrs Pallone next to her husband in Chicago. Sgt. Jesse Sanger told AZCentral that the Maricopa County Medical Examiner's Office still has not officially identified the body, and the case is still an active death investigation. But it is expected the body will soon be announced as Mrs Pallone's. He added that there are currently no signs of fraud or any other criminal activity. Police are also looking into the rough date of death, and also to see whether the body has suffered any broken bones or other damage.","Josephine Pallone died aged 98 in her bed in September 2010 .

"By . Associated Press . The grocery chain Supervalu said Friday that it may have suffered a data breach at stores in as many as five states. Hackers accessed a network that processes store transactions. Account numbers, expiration dates, cardholders' names and other information may have been stolen, the company said. Grocery stores — as well as some stand-alone liquor shops — in Minnesota, Virginia, Illinois, Maryland and Missouri may have been affected between June 22 and July 17. The cards from which data may have been stolen were used at 180 Supervalu stores and liquor stores run under the Cub Foods, Farm Fresh, Hornbacher's, Shop 'n Save and Shoppers Food & Pharmacy names. Data may also have been stolen from 29 franchised Cub Foods stores and liquor stores. Supervalu officials say stores across five states may have been target of a data breach. Hackers could have credit card information for customers who shopped between June 22 and July 17 . There was also a related criminal intrusion at some stores owned and run by Albertson's LLC and New Albertson's Inc., the company said. Supervalu provides information technology services to the Albertson's and New Albertson's stores. Supervalu said that it currently believes the data breach did not impact its owned or licensed Save-A-Lot stores or any of the independent grocery stores supplied by the company through its independent business network other than the franchised Cub Foods stores previously mentioned. Once it learned of the breach, the company said that it took immediate steps to secure that portion of its network. An investigation into the incident is ongoing. The company hasn't determined if any cardholder data was actually stolen and said Friday that there's no evidence of the data being misused. The release of information about the breach was released out of 'an abundance of caution,' the company said. It is believed that the intrusion has been contained, the company said, and it remains confident shoppers can safely use their credit and debit cards at its stores. The intrusion at Supervalu is just the latest in a string of data breaches at major retailers. Earlier this month, Target said that expenses tied to a breach leading up to last year's holiday shopping season could reach as high as $148 million. The incident led to a major shakeup and CEO Gregg Steinhafel resigned. Restaurant operator P.F. Chang's confirmed in June that data from credit and debit cards used at its restaurants was stolen. There have been smaller breaches at Neiman Marcus and Michaels Stores Inc., and even at Goodwill. There are currently efforts underway to change the technology used in credit and debit cards to make consumer information more secure. Grocery stores in Minnesota, Virginia, Illinois, Maryland and Missouri may have been affected. This includes  Cub Foods, Farm Fresh, Hornbacher's, Shop 'n Save and Shoppers Food & Pharmacy.","Hackers could have accessed credit card information for customers at some of the chain's 180 stores between June 22 and July 17 .

"By . Zoe Szathmary For Mailonline . A humpback whale captured in a stunning photograph last year near New York harbor just can't seem to stay away. 'Jerry' the whale was seen in 2013 splashing around the Rockaways, MyFoxNY said. Gotham Whale researchers saw 'Jerry' three times in 2013 and have seen him 'multiple times' this year, Paul Sieswerda told MailOnline. Sieswerda, Gotham Whale's founder, said the whale was a calf in 2011 and scientists observed him in Maine. Just splashing around! 'Jerry' is seen in the Rockaways with the Empire State Building far off . 'Jerry' - whose scientific name is NYC0011 - was nicknamed because he was seen on Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia's August 1 birthday, Sieswerda said. The whale also happened to have a cut mark, which reminded the onlooker who named him of the guitarist's finger injury. 'Naming whales is a process that thsoe of us in science don't do easily,' Sieswerda said. '[It takes] great deliberation and consensus by a number of researchers so we don't mix up the whales.' He explained that researchers identify whales by looking at the undersides of their tails and examining their unique markings. Breath of fresh air: Jerry's head peeks out from the water . Going for a swim! 'Jerry' is regularly seen by Gotham Whale watchers . This year, whales have been seen 49 times in waters near New York, he said, and appeared 43 times in 2013, 25 times in 2012, and a mere 5 times in 2011. Sieswerda said Jerry and whales like him have appeared because of 'major improvements to the water conditions, primarily the Hudson River, the harbor itself and that translates to the waters outside of New York.' 'And in the past, what it brought down was not very nice,' he said. Those waters are now hospitable to algae and fish whales prey on, Sieswerda said. The whales are regularly seen 'lunge feeding,' during which they take in 'hundreds of pounds of fish and thousands of gallons of water,' Sieswerda told MailOnline.

"By . Tim Shipman . Ed Miliband said he wanted to 'change politics' by reducing the voting age  for the first time since 1969 . Sixteen and 17-year-olds would get the vote under a Labour government, Ed Miliband declared yesterday. The Labour leader announced that he wants to ‘change politics’ by reducing the voting age for the first time since 1969 so politicians ‘hear the voices of people that haven’t been heard for a long time’. But he was quickly accused of bowing to pressure from his union paymasters by making the announcement – which comes seven months after Unite demanded Labour make votes for 16-year-olds a manifesto pledge. The Tories added that the plan was one more worthy of a ‘student’ politician. It was also even denounced by one of Mr  Miliband’s own MPs as ‘utterly irrelevant’. The Labour leader’s move comes after Scotland’s first minister Alex Salmond did a deal with the Coalition to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in next year’s independence referendum. In his speech, Mr Miliband said politicians should listen to the ‘voices of young people demanding a job, the voices of young people who demand that we shoulder and don’t shirk our responsibilities to the environment.’ He added: ‘Let’s give a voice to these young people in our party. And let’s give a voice to these young people in our democracy, let’s give the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds and make them part of our democracy.’ The voting age in Britain was last reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969 but polls show that the public – and even most young people – do not support votes at 16. The Labour leader's move followed in the footsteps of Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, who did a deal with the coalition to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in the independence referendum . Labour MP Tom Harris said: ‘I just think it’s utterly irrelevant. It is opposed by most people in Britain, most adults anyway. It is the kind of thing that is an obsession of a tiny minority who think this kind of stuff matters, which it does not. ‘It is exactly the kind of middle-class dinner party issue that tofu-eaters throughout the country get really excited about.’ Grant Shapps, Chairman of the Conservative Party accused Mr Miliband of bowing to union demands . Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps accused Mr Miliband of bowing to union demands. In the past, Labour has said the matter would be one on which MPs could have a free vote in Parliament. But on 27 February this year Unite, which has given Labour more than £9million since Mr Miliband became leader, put a submission to the party’s policy review, demanding the party make a manifesto pledge to lower the voting age to 16. The union, run by Len McCluskey, said: ‘Young people should be given a stake in the political process by lowering the voting  age to 16.’ Labour insiders believe the party will benefit from the move to vote because the 16- and 17-year-old age group are considered more likely to vote in its favour. In August, shadow cabinet member Sadiq Khan said votes at 16 would become official party policy,  a move confirmed by Mr Miliband for the first time yesterday. Mr Shapps said: ‘This is literally student politics from Ed Miliband. 'He’s been weak on welfare: now he wants to tinker with voting ages instead. It shows trade union bosses are buying his policies. This year the unions demanded he politicise the classroom, with votes for youngsters who are still at school. Today he has caved in. If he’s too weak to stand up to the unions then he’s too weak to stand up for ordinary hardworking people.’ Marc Kidson, of the British Youth Council group, which manages the campaign Votes at 16, welcomed the plan as ‘an important constitutional reform... that will mean more young people participate in politics’. Other countries where voting is permitted at 16 include Austria, Nicaragua, Brazil and Ecuador. Labour has also abandoned its plan to cut VAT from 20 to 17.5 per cent after warnings that the move would be unaffordable. The party’s Treasury spokesman Rachel Reeves told BBC’s Newsnight the temporary cut – which had been a centrepiece in its ‘five-point plan for growth’ and would have cost £12billion – was no longer necessary because the economy is starting to recover. A party source said the VAT cut ‘won’t be in the manifesto’. Yvette Cooper watches her husband Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls gives his keynote speech to delegates . Labour will today promise to make identity theft a specific criminal offence, in a bid to stem the tide of online crime. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper will tell the Labour Party conference that police are  struggling to cope with net fraud. The British Retail Consortium  estimates that online crime in  the retail sector alone costs £200million a year. Although . fraudsters can at present be convicted of a series  of crimes, a Labour . source  yesterday that said  the lack of  an offence specifically . relating  to identity theft ‘leads to some confusion about how to arrest . or charge people’. Miss . Cooper will say: ‘We live our lives online now – but criminals know that . too. It’s a big risk  for business. And it’s a big cost for all of us. ‘When the credit card companies and banks write off fraud we all lose out from higher charges. ‘The problem is escalating by  the day. ‘The . police can’t do this alone. They don’t stand a chance. We need changes . in the law to make it easier to prosecute identity theft.’ Labour would also set up a  new quango, Fraudwatch, to co-ordinate action against online criminals.","The Labour leader announced that he wants to ‘change politics’

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . Ed Miliband’s attempts to engage with Labour’s grassroots have backfired – after they branded his policies ‘pathetic’, ‘bland’ and even ‘catastrophic’. The comments were posted on Labour’s Your Britain website, which was set up in 2012 to gather honest views from members on what should be in the party manifesto. But instead it has attracted a host of highly critical views about the Labour leader’s current pitch to voters. Scroll down for video . Backfired: Scathing comments have been posted by grassroots Labourites on a website by Ed Miliband . The Oxford Labour Party branded economic plans ‘wishy-washy’ and ‘bland’, while party and policy forum member Carol Hayton attacked the party’s ‘hugely disappointing, if not catastrophic’ position on housing. Labour in Ulverston, Cumbria, criticised the stance on welfare reform as ‘pathetic’, and Labour’s association in Sheffield Heeley labelled the party’s education plans ‘too narrow and too timid’. The website was launched two years ago, and Mr Miliband said it would ‘give a voice to members’. It claims to be the ‘online home of Labour ideas and policy development’ – and tells contributors: ‘By joining in you can play a part in developing our next manifesto.’ The Tories seized on the comments, saying they showed Ed Miliband was ‘just not up to it’. But a Labour spokesman branded reports of the comments ‘desperate rubbish’. Details of the comments emerged as a former Labour advisor launched a highly critical attack on Labour’s high command over its failure to accept public spending cuts – and said time was ‘running out’ for the party to present a vision for how it would run Britain. Patrick Diamond, a former adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown said Labour ‘palpably lacks a coherent governing vision for an age of austerity’. Humbled: But a Labour spokesman said highlighting the comments was a 'baseless smear' by the Tories . Writing on the Telegraph website he said: ‘Ed Miliband’s ideological instinct is to reassert the case for interventionist government. ‘His political antennae tell him this is not sustainable in an era of rising public deficits and ballooning national debt. ‘The leader knows there can be no return to post-war ‘tax and spend’ social democracy, yet he is trapped by antipathy to the New Labour project from spelling out a non-statist alternative. ‘He faces a fork in the road, but is reluctant to choose: as a consequence, Labour palpably lacks a coherent governing vision for an age of austerity. With nine months to go until a general election, time is running out for Her Majesty’s opposition.’ The Your Britain website collected comments from constituency Labour Party groups across the country. The party in Manchester Withington warned many of its members found proposals ‘simply too vague’, while the association in Tamworth, Staffordshire warned that the draft education policy agenda ‘lacks vision, strategy and coherence’. Labour’s association in Sheffield Heeley labelled the Labour Party’s education plans ‘too narrow and too timid’ Labour party member and policy forum member Carol Hayton attacked the party’s ‘hugely disappointing, if not catastrophic’ position on housing. She wrote: ‘Ed Miliband acknowledged that we have a housing crisis... He said that to solve the crisis a future Labour government would ensure that by the end of the next parliament i.e by 2020 Britain would be building 200,000 homes a year. This response is totally inadequate.’ Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, said: ‘This is pretty damning stuff. First it was Labour MPs and councillors telling us that Ed Miliband is just not up to it, now Labour’s grassroots have publicly criticised Ed Miliband’s weak leadership and political gimmicks which offer no long-term solutions for hardworking families across the country. ‘The truth is, only the Conservative team can offer a long term economic plan that will secure a brighter future for British people and their families.’ A Labour spokesman said: ‘This is desperate rubbish, pumped out by a Tory Party who’ll try anything to distract from their failure. ‘This is a public website where everyone can contribute and people have done so in their thousands. Comments aren’t Labour policy. ‘While the Tories try to sell their baseless smears, the Labour Party will get on with setting out a positive vision for Labour’s future.’","Comments were posted on the party's Your Britain website set up in 2012 .

"By . Associated Press . A man who was having little luck catching salmon decided to look for fossils over the weekend and found a wooly mammoth tusk in the same Alaska location where his mother found one 22 years ago. Andrew Harrelson found the 12-foot fossilized tusk on Sunday in a bend of the Fish River near his home village of White Mountain about 63 miles east of Nome, the Alaska Dispatch News reported Wednesday. Harrelson was 3 in 1992 when his mother, Luann Harrelson, spotted a 79-pound mammoth tusk fossil in the muck of the river. His father pulled it from the water and Andrew posed for a picture with it. Lucky find: Andrew Harrelson posing with a 12-foot fossilized tusk that he found in a bend of the Fish River near the village of White Mountain, about 63 miles east of Nome, Alaska.  Harrelson decided to look for fossils over the weekend and found a wooly mammoth tusk in the same spot his mother found one 22 years ago . 'This big, old log-looking thing,' he said. 'I had no clue what it was until they told me.' Harrelson's father, Daniel Harrelson, said villagers previously found mammoth teeth at the site. 'I think at one point, thousands of years ago, it must have been a mud hole or something that animals got stuck in and then died in it,' Daniel Harrelson said. 'Everything froze in there and then slowly, over time, thaws out a little bit year by year.' On Sunday, Andrew Harrelson, who now lives in Nome, was fishing with his fiancee and two children in the river. He had caught just one coho salmon in two hours so he decided to look for tusks. They arrived at the bend where his mother had found the tusk. Almost immediately, Harrelson saw the base of another tusk, covered by a stump. This photo taken in 1992 shows Andrew's mom Luann Harrelson posing with her three-year-old son after finding her own wooly mammoth tusk in the same Fish River.  Tusks of the extinct wooly mammoth range from 12,000 to 400,000 years old. Hers was 79 pounds, while this week's find topped out at 162 pounds . His fiancee, Renee Parker, looked on the other side of the boat and saw the tip of the fossil. Harrelson drove his family back to White Mountain and returned with a relative. Together, they pried out the fossil. Back at White Mountain, he weighed it on a bathroom scale and it registered 162 pounds. Tusks of wooly mammoth range in age from 12,000 to 400,000 years old. Dale Guthrie, a Quaternary Period paleontologist who retired from the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said the last glacial period in Alaska was about 18,000 years ago. Mainland mammoths died off by about 12,000 years ago, he said. 'The (White Mountain) tusks could be that young or they could be when mammoths first arrived here, which is 300,000 to 400,000 years ago,' Guthrie said. 'You'd have to radio carbon date it to see its age.' They can fetch as much as $75 per pound. Prospective buyers have been calling Harrelson to inquire about the tusk. The couple want to buy a home in Nome. 'I'm pretty sure he's going to try to use the money for down payment for a house,' Daniel Harrelson said.","Andrew Harrelson and his mother both found tusks in the Fish River near White Mountain, Alaska .
