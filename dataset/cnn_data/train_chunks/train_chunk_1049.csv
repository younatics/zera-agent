"James Vosper was sentenced to an 18 month community order at Bristol Magistrates' Court . A former firearms police officer who kicked his girlfriend in the stomach after he flew into a drunken rage because he had accidentally left £30 in a cash point has been spared prison. James Vosper, who has 16 years' experience as a police officer, had drunk a bottle and a half of wine before his girlfriend Melissa Mustoe, a mother of two, arrived home. His attack was recorded after Miss Mustoe, 37, called police when she managed to lock Vosper out of their home in Abbeywood. After he kicked her in the stomach Miss Mustoe remained on the phone for 40 minutes and seemed breathless and scared. The court heard Vosper has recently resigned from his role at Gloucestershire Constabulary before he was 'pushed'. Vosper, a father of two, had previously been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder following an incident at work and as a result had started drinking heavily. He had been drinking on the night of the attack on December 11. He had texted Miss Mustoe to say that 'everything has gone to rat s***' after he realised he had made a mistake at the cash point. When police arrived he tried to claim he had been the victim of assault and acted in self defence. But magistrates dismissed his argument and found him guilty of assault after a two-day trial. However they decided his guilty conviction did not include an accusation he throttled his partner during the incident, which he had been accused of during the trial. Speaking during the trial, prosecutor Ian Jackson, said: '[He] kicked her in the stomach while she was on the phone to police. 'During the course of the 999 call you can hear part of the alleged attack taking place. You can hear her reaction. 'Very shortly in, about four or five minutes you can hear her explain she has just been kicked in the stomach by Mr Vosper. 'Throughout the call she sounds breathless, exasperated and scared. To have waited on the phone for 40 to 45 minutes she must have genuinely been fearful.' Mr Vosper, a father of two, has since resigned from Gloucestershire Constabulary after a 16 year police career . The officer was given an 18 month community order. The couple had been together for five years after both their marriages failed. Alexander West, defending Vosper, said: 'He has been forced to resign from his role as a police officer. He has lost his job of 16 years as a result of his actions. 'It's a somewhat forced resignation in that it was a jump before being pushed. 'A serving police officer can not be seen having a conviction for domestic violence assault on his record. He simply resigned before being forced.' Bristol Magistrates' Court heard that Vosper is currently working his four-week notice period and will retain his pension - but it will be frozen until he is 60. Mr West, defending, added his client had no previous convictions and the assault was 'largely contributed' to by alcohol - a problem Vosper was now addressing. Bristol Magistrates' Court heard that the former firearms officer is addressing his problems with alcohol . 'He has submitted to regular testing', he said. 'They have found towards the end of the programme his alcohol use had dramatically reduced to the point that he was no longer considered a habitual user.' Patricia Jell sentenced him to an 18-month community order, with 18-months supervision, and a requirement to complete the 'Building Better Relationships' course. He was also ordered to pay £930 costs, an £85 fine and a £60 victim surcharge.","James Vosper, a former firearms officer, kicked his girlfriend in the stomach .

"Nick Clegg yesterday said the Government must raise taxes for the better off as he rounded on Tory plans to clear the deficit by cutting welfare and public spending. Setting out his red lines for any future coalition deal with the Tories, Mr Clegg accused David Cameron and George Osborne of ‘beating up on the poor’ and said he would insist on a raft of new taxes to help pay off the deficit. As the party gathered in Glasgow for its annual conference, Liberal Democrat leader Mr Clegg said he wanted about 20 per cent of future deficit reduction to come from tax rises on the better off. He also accused the Tories of ‘trashing human rights’ to pander to Ukip, and that he would never accept Mr Cameron’s plan to sideline the European Court of Human Rights. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg said he would not allow the Tories to clear the deficit through spending cuts alone . And he shattered Coalition unity on dealing with Islamic State, saying he would block Tory plans for a Commons vote on extending British bombing raids from Iraq into Syria. While senior Lib Dems insist they will not pull out of the Coalition, they are now focused on highlighting differences with the Tories in a desperate bid to spark a revival in their support. The Prime Minister and Chancellor said last week that a further £25billion in cuts would be found after the election, with £3billion coming from a freeze on benefits. The Tories also announced plans to cut the benefits cap – the maximum amount any household can receive in welfare – from £26,000 to £23,000. Mr Clegg yesterday said that he opposed both moves and would instead demand tax rises on the rich and the middle classes as the price for any new coalition deal. He said the case had not been made for ‘ratcheting down’ the welfare cap. The Deputy Prime Minister accused his coalition partners of being ‘economically extreme’. Asked if the Lib Dems would increase taxes to help fill the hole in the public finances, he said: ‘Yes, of course. We must raise taxes.’ The Deputy PM insisted the public wanted the Lib Dems to 'anchor' the Tories in the 'centre ground' One senior Lib Dem voiced dismay at the intervention, saying: ‘I’m not sure we want the headline from our conference to be: Vote for us and we’ll raise your taxes.’ But Mr Clegg said voters should be clear about where the burden of tackling the huge budget deficit left by Labour would fall. He said Lib Dem plans would include ending tax relief on pensions for the better off and scrapping benefits such as the winter fuel allowance, free bus passes and free TV licences for wealthier pensioners. And he confirmed the party was changing its original plans for a mansion tax, even referring to the flagship policy at one point as the ‘so-called mansion tax’. Aides said the policy, on which the party fought the last election, was now known internally as the ‘revaluation of high value properties with additional council tax bands’. The mansion tax began life as a proposal to put a 1 per cent annual levy on the value of all homes above £2million. But the policy was changed this year under pressure from the party’s London MPs. It was replaced with plans for new council tax bands on properties above that value. The Lib Dems say the policy will raise £1.5billion, but have yet to set out how it will work. Yesterday Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, called for the introduction of a ‘fairness rule’ until the deficit was paid off. He said it would ensure the ‘best off’ have contributed the biggest share of their income to help pay down the deficit. In an interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Clegg accused the Conservatives of announcing with ‘almost undisguised relish’ that they would not ask the wealthiest to pay a ‘single penny towards completing the deficit reduction effort’. He added: ‘What we are saying is that those choices, either sticking your head in the sand or beating up on the poor, are not the choices the British people want. They want balance. They want balance between a strong economy and a fairer society, and that is what we are offering.’ Asked why the Lib Dems remained in government with a party they despised, he replied: ‘We have restrained the Conservatives from doing what they want on penalising the poor, on ignoring the environment, on trashing our civil liberties and human rights.’ The Lib Dem conference in Glasgow – the last before the election – comes against the backdrop of dismal poll ratings that has seen its support fall to just 6 per cent. Mr Clegg yesterday appeared to concede that the Lib Dems were ceasing to be a national party, saying: ‘I accept that, we’re not fighting as forcefully in some parts of the country as others.’ Senior Lib Dems are also furious that last week the Tories copied their plan to raise the starting threshold for income tax to £12,500 if they win the next election. They will try to wrest back the initiative later this week by announcing they will go further by raising the threshold for National Insurance.","Deputy PM says he will not allow deficit to be eliminated by cuts alone .

"A crack team of officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working around-the-clock in Dallas to find and monitor every person who may have come in contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person in the United States to be diagnosed with the deadly Ebola infection. However the 10-person team are yet to track down all the people Duncan may have interacted with - either during his two visits to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital or elsewhere - and continue to monitor those they believe did to see whether they contracted the virus. The operation is being led infectious disease expert David Kuhar and involves CDC investigators compiling a list of 'potential contacts' and going to their house to meet in-person. 'At each house we spend as much time as necessary with the potential contact,' pediatrician and epidemic intelligence officer Matt Karwowski told The Washington Post. Scroll down for video . High alert: A hazmat team member arrives to clean a unit at the Ivy Apartments, where the first confirmed Ebola virus patient in the United States, Eric Thomas Duncan, had been staying with family. The CDC and Texas health officials are scrambling to find anyone who came in contact with Duncan . Arrival: Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan, 42 greets a woman and phones his family after landing at Dallas-Forth Worth International Airport on September 20. The CDC now says a list of people in Dallas most at-risk of contracting Ebola stands at about 50 . 'We're very careful to do education around Ebola — symptoms, how (Ebola) is spread. 'We review activities, contacts. Every little detail helps us pin down a person's risk level.' Initially the investigators determine whether the contact did interact with Duncan and, if so, whether they are at risk for developing Ebola. Then they need to assess the health of the individual and look for Ebola-like symptoms. Karowski says the list of people who are considered at-risk now stands at about 50. Nine of those are considered high-risk. 'By identifying contacts early on and following them for a 21-day period, we interrupt the chain of transmission, and that's the most effective strategy,' Karwowski told The Post. On Thursday, the Dallas County's public health department said more than 80 people had been exposed to Ebola, via Duncan, in some way. The department said 12 to 18 people came into direct contact with the Ebola patient and the rest came into contact with members of that group. Scene: The CDC have been scouring Texas Heath Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas to see which workers or patients interacted with Thomas Eric Duncan during his two visits to the hospital . They are all being monitored and no one has shown any symptoms, said Erikka Neroes, a spokeswoman for the Dallas County Department of Health and Human Services. The Texas Department of State Health Services said separately it was working from a list of about 100 potential or possible contacts and will soon have an official contact tracing number that will be lower. 'Out of an abundance of caution, we're starting with this very wide net, including people who have had even brief encounters with the patient or the patient's home,' said Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of State Health Services.","A 10-person team are working 18 hours a day to find and monitor individuals who may have come in contact with Eric Thomas Duncan in Dallas .

"Warren Buffett could lose $1billion due to plummeting IBM stocks, it has been reported. Company Berkshire Hathaway, of which Buffett is CEO, has 70,173,978 IBM shares, MarketWatch reported. Buffett risked losing $1,056,118,369 when IBM saw its stock price fall 8.3% before the market opened, the website reported early Monday morning. While still costly, Buffett's Monday loss may actually be slightly less. As of this writing, IBM's stocks are down 7.14%, which would mean a $912,261,714 loss. Bad investment: Warren Buffett may lose hundreds of millions of dollars Monday due to IBM's plummeting stocks . In early October, Buffett said of a loss on Tesco worth hundreds of millions of dollars to CNBC: 'With Tesco, we definitely made a mistake. I made a mistake on that one more than anybody else made a mistake ... That was a huge mistake by me.' IBM fell short of Wall Street profit expectations and revenue slid 4 per cent, sending shares down 7 per cent at the open of trading. IBM's performance dragged down shares across the semiconductor industry. The company will pay $1.5 billion to Globalfoundries in order to shed its costly chip division. IBM Director of Research John E. Kelly III said in an interview Monday that handing over control of the semiconductor operations will allow it to grow faster, while IBM continues to invest in and expand its chip research. IBM will make payments to the chipmaker over three years, but it took a $4.7 billion charge for the third quarter when it reported earnings Monday. Privately held Globalfoundries will get IBM's global commercial semiconductor technology business, including intellectual property and technologies related to IBM Microelectronics. It also gets IBM's semiconductor manufacturing operations and plants in East Fishkill, New York and Essex Junction, Vermont, as well as access to thousands of patents and IBM's commercial microelectronics business. Globalfoundries said that it plans to employ substantially all IBM workers at the East Fishkill and Essex Junction plants, except for a team of semiconductor server group employees who will stay with IBM. Change: The news about Buffett's potentially hefty loss comes as IBM announced it will pay $1.5 billion to Globalfoundries in order to shed its costly chip division . Under the agreement, Globalfoundries will become IBM's exclusive server processor semiconductor technology provider for 22 nanometer (nm), 14nm and 10nm semiconductors for the next 10 years. Globalfoundries was spun off from Advanced Micro Devices in 2009 to handle chip production. IBM said handing over the chip division will allow it to concentrate on fundamental semiconductor research and the development of future cloud, mobile, big data analytics, and secure transaction-optimized systems. The transaction is expected to close next year. On Monday, IBM reported that its adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $3.68 per share, while revenue totaled $22.4 billion. The performance missed the expectations of analysts polled by FactSet, who predicted earnings of $4.32 per share on revenue of $23.39 billion. In a statement, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty said 'We are disappointed in our performance. We saw a marked slowdown in September in client buying behavior, and our results also point to the unprecedented pace of change in our industry. While we did not produce the results we expected to achieve, we again performed well in our strategic growth areas – cloud, data and analytics, security, social and mobile - where we continue to shift our business. We will accelerate this transformation.'

"A mother and son who claim to have given some of the stars of TOWIE their brilliant white smiles are facing prosecution after being accused of not being licensed for dentistry. Joanne Wheatley, 43, and her son 23-year-old Cane Wheatley appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates Court today facing allegations by the General Dental Council (GDC) that they 'unlawfully held themselves out to be prepared to practice dentistry'. Several celebrities including The Only Way Is Essex stars Danielle Armstrong and James Lock, as well as Geordie Shore's Gary Beadle have been used in advertising for the business called Essex Smiles. Scroll down for video . Joanne Wheatley, left and her son Cane, who run Essex Smiles in Harlow, who are being accused of not being licensed for dentistry . They offer whitening treatments ranging from £40 for a 'White Smile' to £60 for a 'Essex Smile'. But Ms Wheatley and her son, both of Harlow, have both pleaded not guilty to being unregistered dental professionals. Prosecutor Fallon Alexis told the court that tooth whitening could only be undertaken by a registered professional dentist, dental hygienist, dental therapist or clinical dental technician. He said that neither of the defendants were registered with the GDC. He explained that undercover investigators working for the GDC posed as potential customers using false names after the local council received complaints about Essex Smiles, based in Harlow. Retired police officers Pierre Turner and Deborah Woledge told the court how Ms Wheatley explained and demonstrated what would happen to the 'nervous' Ms Woledge when they visited Essex Smiles on May 19 this year. The court heard how she also let them visit a patient undergoing treatment in another room. Ms Woledge said it was explained to her that a blue gel would be put on gums to protect them and a whitening gel would then be put on teeth in the 45-minute session. There would be three applications lasting 15 minutes each under a LED accelerator lamp, 'which activates the gel, opens the pores and whitens the teeth from the inside out.' She said the gel did not contain peroxide and was a USA 'oxygel', the court heard. TOWIE stars Danielle Armstrong, left, and James Lock, right, who have appeared in advertising for Essex Smiles . Giving evidence, Ms Woledge said she mentioned she had heard on Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine programme that you had to be a dentist to do teeth whitening. Ms Wheatley is said to have claimed: 'No you don’t need to be a dentist. It’s only tooth whitening.' Asked if she was qualified or trained, she allegedly replied she had been trained and it cost her £2,000. She said if Ms Woledge went ahead with the £40 sale price offer, she would do the treatment on a later date as her son would be on holiday. The defendant allegedly told her she would be happy. Ms Wooledge added: 'She said she had lots of repeat customers and they were all happy with the result.' Bobby Norris from TOWIE and Gary Beadle from Geordie Shore have also been involved in helping to promote Essex Smiles . The court was also told that the prosecution against Cane Wheatley is based on a video downloaded on May 23 this year from the Essex Smiles web address in which he is seen talking about and performing a treatment on a young woman. In it he says: 'I am the owner of Essex Smiles and this is one of my clients today.' Another GDC investigator, retired Met officer Steven White, told magistrates he posed as someone responding to the firm’s advert and spoke to Mr Wheatley over the phone on March 31 this year about the services on offer. Mr White claimed that Wheatley stated there was a registered GDC dentist who supervised the teeth whitening technician. He also said a client’s mouth was not examined by a dentist beforehand. Warning letters were sent to Essex Smiles’ Harlow address on 18 September 2013 and 3 February 2014. Both mother and son, who run Essex Smiles have pleaded not guilty to being unregistered and 'unlawfully holding themselves out to be prepared to practice dentistry' Letters inviting both to a voluntary interview were sent on 3 June. There were no replies to any of those, said Mr White. Magistrates have now adjourned the trial until February next year. Outside court Ms Wheatley confirmed that they had lots of celebrity clients and her son said he was friends with a lot of the TOWIE stars.

"A robber who was high on drugs when he killed a Victorian jewellery store owner in front of his wife has been jailed for 27 years. Gavin Perry, 27, killed jeweller Dermot O'Toole as he rushed to protect his wife Bridget during the robbery at Hastings, south of Melbourne, in July 2013. Perry was high on the drug ice and brandishing a knife when he burst into the shop, pushed Mrs O'Toole into a cabinet and stabbed Mr O'Toole as he lay helpless on his back. Scroll down for video . Gavin Perry, 27, killed jeweller Dermot O'Toole as he rushed to protect his wife Bridget during the robbery at Hastings, south of Melbourne, in July 2013 . Victorian Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth said Mrs O'Toole was forced to watch her husband die. 'She had to watch her husband of 41 years die in front of her as he came to her defence,' she said. Shortly before robbing the O'Tooles' store Perry purchased a large carving knife from a nearby supermarket. 'As soon as you encountered the slightest resistance from the O'Tooles you swiftly resorted to using the knife against them both,' Justice Hollingworth said on Monday. Bridget O'Toole and her sons  Christian, Dale  and Trent leave the court after the  sentence hearing for the murder of her husband Dermot O'Toole . She said CCTV footage of the robbery showed Perry acting in a frenzied manner consistent with someone on the drug ice. The only explanation Perry offered was that he had been abusing drugs. Justice Hollingworth said Perry would continue to be a person who posed considerable risks to the community unless he undergoes treatment for his addiction. Perry was on parole when he committed three armed robberies in six days - the final crime targeting the O'Tooles' jewellery shop in Hastings on July 12, 2013. Perry was high on the drug ice and brandishing a knife when he burst into the shop, pushed Mrs O'Toole into a cabinet and stabbed Mr O'Toole as he lay helpless on his back . He was jailed for 27 years on Monday at Melbourne Supreme Court. He must serve 23 years before he is eligible for parole . He had been released from jail in early 2013, after serving four years of a six-year term for armed robbery offences. Justice Hollingworth said he had also breached community based orders and intensive correction orders stemming from his more than 200 criminal convictions. 'The number of them further demonstrates your disregard for the law,' Justice Hollingworth said. Perry pleaded guilty to murder, intentionally causing injury and three counts of armed robbery. He must serve 23 years before he is eligible for parole.","Gavin Perry was sentenced to 27 years in jail on Monday at Melbourne's Supreme Court .

"Strong painkillers doled out by doctors in their thousands are doing more harm than good, according to a respected medical body. Addiction to codeine, morphine and oxycodone, and other opioid drugs is reaching dangerous levels, the American Academy of Neurology has said. Frequent overdoses and a boom in serious side effects in the US means doctors should curb their use of the prescription drugs, the society said. Addiction to codeine, morphine and oxycodone, and other opioid drugs is reaching dangerous levels, the American Academy of Neurology has said (file picture) It called for random drug screenings for patients who are prescribed the medication in a bid to tackle addiction. The statement, which highlights concerns about overprescribing in the US, will be examined carefully in Britain, experts said last night. There has been a rapid rise in painkillers taken this side of the Atlantic, with more than 60million such prescriptions written in 2012, a 30 per cent rise in five years. Charities estimate there are 32,000 painkiller addicts in Britain, mainly those who initially took the pills to ease a minor ailment. Dr Gary Franklin of the American Academy of Neurology, writing in the journal Neurology, said: ‘There have been more deaths from prescription opioids in the most vulnerable young to middle-aged groups than from firearms and car accidents. Doctors, states, institutions and patients need to work together to stop this epidemic. ‘More than 100,000 people have died from prescription opioid use since policies changed in the late 1990s to allow much more liberal long-term use.’ Dr Franklin said 50 per cent of US patients taking opioid painkillers for three months are still on the same drugs five years later. Opioids such as codeine and morphine are strictly controlled in the UK. All but the weakest doses are available only with a prescription, with just 8mg of codeine allowed in over-the-counter forms. Doctors are concerned about rising numbers of stronger codeine pills prescribed by GPs (file picture) But doctors are concerned about rising numbers of stronger codeine pills and other opioids prescribed by GPs. Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: ‘Like the US, there has been a marked increase in opioid prescribing for pain in the UK … it remains unclear as to whether the harms … of this increased prescribing are the same.’ But Professor David Nutt, the former government drugs adviser, said: ‘It is all very well them saying that in the USA, but they have access to medical marijuana which we do not in the UK. When people are in constant pain it would be inhumane to remove their pain relief. We need an alternative.’ A spokesman for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, which forms British drugs policy, said it would look carefully at the US research, adding: ‘Opioids such as codeine and morphine are scientifically proven, effective medicines for pain relief and their benefits outweigh their risks for the majority of people. ‘There are already strong warnings in the product information for all opioids about the known side effects, including the risk of tolerance or dependence.’ Regular use of codeine can heighten sensitivity to pain, research has found. A study found codeine gives much less initial pain relief than morphine, but results in the same increased sensitivity to pain over time. Researcher Jacinta Johnson, of Australia’s Royal Adelaide Hospital, said: ‘In the long term it has the effect of worsening the problem.’ Professor Paul Rolan added that it ‘could be detrimental’.","Addiction to opiod drugs is reaching dangerous levels, top doctors warn .

"Fashion and politics often crossover. Fashion weeks are met with anti-fur protesters and there are constant debates about the working conditions of people employed by clothing manufacturers. So it should come as no surprise to see sensitive subjects make an appearance at Paris Fashion. Day three of the event saw several designers pushing boundaries with their creative choices. Scroll down for video . Hussein Chalayan closed his SS15 show with a revealing dress illustrated with a woman wearing a Niqab . Hussein Chalayan presented a collection of floaty evening dresses that revealed patches of bare flesh and came in a wash of grey tones. However, one particular dress caught the spectators attention. In his finale, the piece was completed with an illustration of a woman in a full Niqab slinking up the side split of the slender model. Other pieces in the collection featured silk jumpsuits and matching hats printed with army camouflage. The collection certainly displayed certain parallels with the current world conflicts but Chalayan insists that this was not his inspiration and said it actually reflected the relationship between Spain and Maghreb. This is not the first time that the Turkish designer has caused controversy with his use of traditional dress in his clothing lines. In his most famous collection which he presented 16 years ago, displayed models all wearing a traditional burka in a line. However, each model became more and more naked until one was completely nude as they got further along the line. Hussein Chalayan says that his collection takes inspiration from the relationship between Spain and Maghreb . The designer insists unusual decoration has no reflection on the Syrian conflict . The Turkish designer presented colourful goggles alongside army print silks . On the very same day that Chalayan presented his SS15 range another designer linked their line back to one of the world's most well-known political issues, with Russian president Vladimir Putin taking centre stage at the Talbot Runhof SS15 Collection. The much opposed leader appeared across the t-shirts of the models in the form of tourist posters with slogans such as 'Visit Milan..Before He Does!' The design took inspiration from t-shirts that were sold at Moscow's Gum department stores printed with images of Putin in a Hawaiian shirt, cocktail in hand, with the headline stating: 'Greetings from Crimea'. Tennessee design duo Talbot Runhof used Vladimir Putin as the print for their sports luxe t-shirts . Talbot Runhof printed images of the Russian leader on tourist style poster accompanied with the words 'Visit Milan/Paris/New York...Before he does' The Tenesse design duo are open in saying that they hope that their controversial tops will help make a statement. They told Women's Wear Daily: 'We thought the fact that some people buy those and are wearing them with pride was an interesting fashion statement,' Talbot said, 'and we thought we use our cute little sporty collection as a form of protest.' Johnny Talbot and Adrian Runhof have previously used their collections as an opportunity to make a political statement. Last season they aimed to make a stand for gay rights when they used an image of a young man holding up a 'corduroy skirts are a sin' sign, as he stood next to an anti-gay activist in that very item of clothing as the inspiration for the collection. Loewe SS15 selection of models seemed abnormally slim in comparison to other catwalks . Over sized handbags and baggy blouses accentuate the women's small frames . In another bold move at day three of the Paris' most stylish event a fashion hot-topic reared its familiar head. The issue of using super skinny models has been one that has plagued the fashion industry for years. It is widely agreed that the use of them can cause young girls to develop eating disorders and after furious campaigning the fashion industry has seen far less of them. As it currently stands models with a body mass index of 18 or under were banned from Madrid Fashion Week and in 2012, Vogue made a pact to protect the health of models by banning all fashion models younger than 16 or ‘who appear to have an eating disorder’ from their pages. However, the models  who appeared on the runway of Loewe seemed to be of a smaller stature of those we have seen on the runway in recent years. Billowing silk blouses and over sized earrings accentuated the models' petite frames and stick-thin arms. Loewe aren't the first designers to feature ultra-skinny women on their runway's with Armani coming under fire at Milan Fashion Week for the use of of their tiny models. Day three of Paris fashion week saw more than its fair share of risky fashion, and whether it will be met with applause or criticism it is sure to keep everyone talking.","The third day of Paris Fashion Week took a more serious turn .

Paula Kassig Tweeted a message intended for the ISIS leadership asking what her family can do to prevent the murder of her son Peter, who is now known as Abdul Rahman. Yesterday, a prominent member of a group affiliated to Al Qaeda called on ISIS to release the humanitarian aid worker as Kassig had treated the Nusra Front man's injuries in Syria. Scroll down for video . Paula Kassig, right, pictured with her husband Ed, pleaded with ISIS to spare the life of her son . Peter Kassig, who is now known as Abdul Rahman after he converted to Islam was abducted in October 2013 . Kassig, pictured, appeared at the end of the video showing the murder of British aid worker Alan Henning . Mrs Kassig worte: 'We have tried to contact you directly to plea for the life of our only son, Abdul Rahman Kassig, and have not received any response. Please tell us what more we can do that Abdul Rahman may continue to serve and live his life in accordance with the teachings of Islam.' Kassig, 26, from Indiana was captured in Syria in October 2013 while working as a humanitarian aid worker. His abduction became public after he appeared at the end of the video showing the brutal murder of fellow aid worker Alan Henning. A senior member of an Al Qaeda-affiliated terror group has spoken out in support of Peter Kassig - the American aid worker threatened by the Islamic State following the murder of Alan Henning. Abu Omar Aqidi - a prominent member of the Syria-based Nusra Front - pleaded with ISIS to spare Kassig's life after he identified the Muslim convert as a medic who helped treat his shrapnel wounds. Kassig is a former Methodist who converted to Islam after being captured and taken prisoner by ISIS in October last year and now calls himself Abdul Rahman. His life was threatened by the militant known as 'Jihadi John' earlier this month following the sickening filmed beheading of Henning - with ISIS sympathisers last night claiming the terrorists plan to murder Kassig in the coming days after a Wednesday 'deadline' for the U.S. to stop bombing them passed. Paula Kassig released her latest plea to ISIS leadership on Twitter yesterday stressing her son's religion . Mrs Kassig released the document in both English and Arabic in a bid to negotiate with the terror group . Aqidi's unexpected intervention came in a series of messages posted on Twitter, in which he identified Kassig as an aid worker who  'performed a successful operation under bombardment by the regime'. He later explained this operation was to remove shrapnel from his leg. He also suggested that Kassig had treated a number of other fighters linked to the Nusra Front - including 'Abu Dujana', who is understood to be one of the regional leaders of the terror group. Aqidi went on to suggest that the senior Nusra Front fighters had later asked after Kassig and were surprised when 'he showed up in the video where ISIS threatened the United States' as they had wrongly assumed him to be a Western jihadist who had joined their ranks. 'It later became clear to me that he's an humanitarian activist that served in Deir Al-Zour for more than a year and was then kidnapped by ISIS,' the militant said. Kassig's case has exposed deep divisions among supporters of the Islamic State, many of whom have said it would be a great sin to murder a recent Muslim convert. Both extremists who met Kassig before he embraced Islam and former prisoners who were held alongside him have argued that the aid worker's conversion is without doubt sincere. Aquidi's remarks on Twitter came as ISIS supporters said a deadline for the U.S. to stop bombing the terror group in Syria and Iraq had expired. They claimed American citizen Kassig would now be murdered as a result - a statement that led to a  number of arguments among the jihadists and their sympathisers on social media. Kassig was working for aid agency Sera when he was abducted by ISIS in eastern Syria 12 months ago . The 26-year-old is said to be haunted by a brief spell as a US army ranger in Iraq in 2007 and first travelled to the Middle East to 'give back' to the Muslim community there. In late 2012, shortly after leaving university, he founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance) - a non-governmental organisation providing  humanitarian aid to those in desperate need - and moved to southern Turkey to oversee the project first hand. With funds dwindling, Kassig continued to make risky ventures into Syria by himself - even after a large number of Westerners were kidnapped by the brutal Islamic State. He was said to have specialised in providing medical aid to fighters and civilians injured during clashes with regime forces. He was eventually seized by the jihadists on 1 October, 2013 while delivering medical supplies to Deir al-Zour. Jihadi John's promise to murder Kassig if the U.S. doesn't end its airstrikes has illuminated deep divisions within the jihadist community over how the terror group should have dealt with the situation. Numerous ISIS sympathisers have claimed they would no longer support the terror group if they killed Kassig - a man they consider to be a pious Muslim. Although radical clerics from around the world had pleaded for Briton Alan Henning's life to be spared due to his aid work, the calls failed to pick up much support within the online jihadist community as he was not as Muslim himself. Yesterday Norwegian-born journalist Salah ad-Din Refsdal - who was born Paul Refsdal but converted to Islam while a prisoner of the Taliban in Afghanistan - made a direct plea to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to 'do the only right thing' and stop his followers killing Kassig. Citing a rule condemning the killing of converts, Resdal said: 'People have suggested that Caliph Ibrahim is not informed that some of his followers are planning to murder Abdul Rahman Kassig.' 'That must clearly be the case. Having studied Islam extensively he for sure is aware of how enormous of a sin it would be to murder a brother who just converted to Islam.' In an earlier message to ISIS Paula Kassig said her son 'only seeks to serve God and the teachings of Islam'","Paula Kassig pleaded in English and Arabic for her son's life on Twitter .

"Greece was holding out for a ray of economic hope yesterday after Athens went up in flames as MPs voted for a savage austerity bill. Early indications were that the markets, at least, were happy, with the FTSE 100 index leaping 53.31 points to 5905.7 in London – its strongest close since late July. It came after Greek politicians backed a package of unpopular cuts in exchange for a £110billion rescue from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. No movie: The historic Attikon cinema in Athens seen here after being set ablaze . Aftermath: A man picks his way through the wreckage of Athens . But despite the surge in the markets, . popular anger simmered as Athens cleaned up after almost 100 buildings . were set alight by rioters while parliament voted on Sunday night. The stench of tear gas still hung in . the air yesterday as firefighters doused smouldering buildings and . rubble was swept from the streets after a night of violence during which . stores and cafes were smashed and looted. At least 170 people were hurt as riot . police clashed with more than 2,000 black-hooded anarchists carrying . clubs and petrol bombs. Police arrested at least 74 people and detained a . further 92. The sight of flames engulfing cinemas, . shops and banks in the capital underscored the sense of deepening . turmoil in the country after more than four years of recession and two . of punishing austerity. Riots also spread to the second city,Thessaloniki, and even the holiday islands of Crete and Corfu. The proposed austerity package . includes cuts in pay, jobs and pensions, with the state workforce . reduced by 150,000 by 2015 and the minimum wage slashed by 22 per cent. Ruined: Workers clear a burned out cafe in central Athens . Wanton destruction: Greece is billions of euros in debt and struggling . to pay its debts, a situation which will not be helped by the riots . Destruction: A tear-gas choked Athens awoke to what looked like a war zone yesterday morning - the result of riots the cash-strapped country can ill afford . Greece needs its bailout cash by March 20 so it can meet debt repayments of £12billion and prevent a chaotic default that would send shockwaves through the eurozone. The austerity bill was welcomed by investors and stock markets across Europe amid hopes that a eurozone meltdown will be avoided. ‘Greece has passed a major hurdle in voting for more austerity and in doing so averting a messy default,’ said Jane Foley, a currency analyst at Rabobank International. ‘Greece’s crisis, however, will continue to play out for years. There appears to be a growing sense that a European monetary union without Greece may eventually become politically acceptable.’ Vandalised: This shop was trashed by rioters during Sunday night's violence against harsh new austerity measures . Hard day's work: A fireman douses a burned out building with water . The vote paves the way for Greece's international creditors to release 130 billion euro in new rescue loans to prevent the country from a potentially catastrophic default next month. Bankruptcy could push Greece out of Europe's euro currency union, drag down other troubled eurozone countries and further roil global markets. Vandalised: A man passes the defaced facade of the Bank of Greece . There was nevertheless strong dissent over the austerity package among the majority Socialists and rival Conservatives who make up Greece's interim coalition government. The parties disciplined the dissenters in their ranks, with the Socialists and Conservatives expelling 22 and 21 lawmakers respectively, reducing their majority in the 300-member parliament from 236 to 193. Germany gave the vote result a cautious welcome, with Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle describing it as 'a first significant step along the right road'. He said: 'However, the actual difficult work with implementing the reforms that have been agreed on is only just starting now. 'That is the decisive precondition for Germany and the other euro partners being able to stand by Greece with a further rescue package. Embarking on implementation is decisive now.' 'These decisions show the will and readiness of the Greeks to make great efforts of their own ... to put the country on the right track,' German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said in Berlin. He said: 'These measures, and we really have to note this, are not just saving for the sake of saving, they are not cutting for the sake of cutting - this is about reforms in every political area. 'These are measures that are meant to restore step by step the financial room for manoeuvre that the country needs for new jobs and new growth to emerge.' Gutted: More than 45 buildings in central Athens were destroyed in the riots . Work: Firemen make a central Athens building safe after it was hit by rioters . Germany's vice chancellor and economy minister, Philipp Roesler, also said the vote was 'a step in the right direction'. He said: 'It is good that the legislation has now been approved, with a broad majority too, but what is decisive is the implementation of structural reforms. 'The legislative process is one thing, implementation is another - I would like to recall again that there have been tax laws for a long time and the fact that they were not adhered to sensibly is part of the problem.' Roesler noted that the upcoming report by Greece's international debt inspectors from the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, known as the 'troika', will be key to determining whether the measures Athens has taken suffice to allow the country to carry its debts and get further aid. He said: 'The pressure that Germany built up in Europe was right in order at least to move Greece further in this right direction.' Sunday's clashes erupted after more than 100,000 protesters marched to the parliament to rally against the drastic cuts. Anger: A petrol bomb explodes near riot police in Athens as lawmakers looked set to endorse a new austerity deal . Riots: A man throws a missile as protesters clash with riot police . 'There's no question that there's quite a lot of anger in the population. There is quite a lot of frustration,' said social and economic analyst Panos Tsakloglou. 'However I do not think that these rioters represent all these demonstrators that were mostly peaceful yesterday.' And the European Commission also welcomed the Greek parliament's decision to approve tough new austerity measures. Economics commissioner Olli Rehn urged Greek officials to 'take ownership' and fully implement the reforms, demanded by the EU in return for a huge bailout. The new bailout deal, which has not yet been finalised, will be combined with a massive bond swap deal to write off half the country's privately held debt, reducing Greece's debt load by about 100 billion euro. But for both deals to materialise, Greece has to persuade its deeply sceptical creditors that it has the will to implement spending cuts and public sector reforms that will end years of fiscal profligacy and tame gaping budget deficits. Eurozone finance ministers are to meet on Wednesday to approve the plan, after refusing to do so during a meeting last week, saying Athens had to first approve the new austerity measures. Street battles: A protester kicks a tear gas canister fired into the crowd of protesters . Fireworks and projectiles are aimed at the Greek parliament during the violent anti-austerity protests . Before signing off on the bailout, the eurozone ministers will still want Greek political leaders to commit in writing to uphold the austerity plan even after the general election in April. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos insisted the country's economic survival hinged on the passage of the new measures. 'The question is not whether some salaries and pensions will be curtailed, but whether we will be able to pay even these reduced wages and pensions,' he said in Parliament before the vote. 'When you have to choose between bad and worse, you will pick what is bad to avoid what is worse.' The further cuts come after two years of deep spending cuts and repeated tax hikes that have sent unemployment soaring to more than 20 per cent and left the country struggling through a fifth year of recession. Those measures were taken in return for a first, 110 billion euro package of rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund, but despite the cutbacks, Greece repeatedly failed to meet its fiscal targets in reducing its debt and deficit and increasing economic competitiveness.

"There is no bigger celebrity at Brazil 2014 than Cristiano Ronaldo, and on Sunday he goes into the jungle hoping to avoid the fate already suffered by both England and Spain - elimination after just two matches. At 29, the FIFA World Player of the Year faces the United States in the Arena da Amazonia in Manaus knowing this is his greatest chance to dominate a finals. But his time in Brazil so far has been a mixture of bizarre sideshows and constant injury concerns. When he arrived at the luxurious Royal Palms hotel in Caminas just outside Sao Paulo 11 days ago he was greeted by around 1,000 fans, a man dressed in a Donald Duck costume and a topless model. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Miss Bumbum Brazil promotional trailer' Pressure: Cristiano Ronaldo has been stalked by Miss Bumbum, a giant Donald Duck and hordes of female fans . Bum note: Andressa Urach, a former Miss Bumbum pageant contestant, is escorted by members of security out of the grounds during a Portugal training session . Fresh trim: Ronaldo, sporting his latest hairstyle, trained at the Arena da Amazonia in Manaus on Saturday . Joker: Ronaldo shares a laugh with defender Bruno Alves and striker Hugo Almeida whilst sat in the dugout . All smiles: The Portgual star appeared to be in high spirits ahead of his country's clash with USA on Sunday . Stay away: Miss Bumbum, who has claimed in the past to have had an affair with Ronaldo, was ejected from Portugal's recent public training session . ‘Ronaldo Duck’ was wearing a  Portugal No 7 shirt and the model was wearing only a coat of patriotic Portuguese red and green paint - the circus had well and truly begun. The topless welcome to Portugal’s base camp had come from Brazilian former ‘Miss Bumbum’, beauty contest winner Andressa Urach, who has claimed in the past to have had an affair with Ronaldo - strenuously denied by the player. Six days later she was ejected from Portugal’s public training session at Ponte Preta’s Moises Lucarelli stadium and told to stay away from the Real Madrid star. Working hard: Ronaldo is put through his paces during Portugal's training session in northern Brazil . Meanwhile, USA coach Jurgen Klinsmann has claimed his players must 'put Cristiano Ronaldo in his place' if they are to secure qualification from Group G ahead of Thursday’s final group game with Germany. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Klinsmann said: 'There’s a lot of admiration for him and for the players who play at big clubs and in the Champions League,' Klinsmann said. 'But this is the moment to prove yourself, to step up, play those guys and put them in their place. We want to put Cristiano in his place. 'We want to make it our game, we are ready for that, and we have been preparing for that for a long time. Tough task: USA boss Jurgen Klinsmann claims his players must 'put Ronaldo in his place' on Sunday evening . Ronaldo’s presence in Brazil has captured the imagination of Campinas, the third largest city in Sao Paulo state. And waving to the 8,000 supporters packed into the Brazilian second division club’s ground on Wednesday, he seemed to be enjoying the attention. But he and his team-mates are less happy about the constant speculation over his fitness. Asked if the Portuguese players were sick of questions about Ronaldo’s physical condition, striker Helder Postiga replied: ‘Yes, but if I am tired of hearing the questions every day then you can imagine how it is for him. I think the talk is too much. He has been training at maximum and that is all there is to say.’ Cover: Ronaldo showed few signs of his knee injury but did wear a small protective bandage over his knee . As he prepares to face the United States, the signals remain contradictory. ‘Ronaldo always finishes the training and then puts ice on his knee but there are normally about 10 players doing the same so it is nothing unusual,’ said Postiga. But while his Portuguese team-mates have lined up this week to repeat the mantra ‘Ronaldo is 100 per cent’, Portuguese doctors confirmed before the tournament that he has a problem with his left knee, and it will require rest as soon as the World Cup ends. And for all that Postiga claims the post-match ice treatment is normal, Ronaldo is the only player who walks off the pitch with a sizeable ice-pack already strapped to his knee. If Portugal are knocked out tonight, Real Madrid want Ronaldo to cut short his World Cup and begin a prolonged period of rest so that he is ready for next season. Protection: Ronaldo has an ice-pack strapped to his knee during a Portugal training session on Wednesday . The Ballon d’Or winner was troubled by an inflamed tendon in the final third of last season and was advised by Real Madrid doctors that he should rest as much as possible between then and the end of the campaign or risk missing the World Cup. He sat out matches against Real Sociedad, Almeria and Celta Vigo in La Liga as well as missing the Spanish Cup final against Barcelona and the second leg of Real Madrid’s Champions League quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund. He managed to play in the Champions League final but club coach Carlo Ancelotti admitted he did so while being less than 100 per cent. He trained again in Manaus on Saturday with a light strapping on his left leg. Portugal coach Paulo Bento has other injury problems, with striker Hugo Almeida, goalkeeper Rui Patricio and Fabio Coentrao all out and Pepe missing today’s game through suspension. Ball control: Ronaldo puts pressure on his knee as he takes on team-mates during a practice match . Their performance in their opening game against Germany did little to shift the attention away from the Ronaldo soap opera as a 4-0 defeat left Germany top of Group G and Portugal bottom. The heavy loss has left them needing to win their two remaining games to be sure of progressing beyond the group stages of the World Cup. An early exit will be disastrous for Ronaldo’s personal quest to justify the ‘best player in the world’ tag he finally earned when he won the Ballon d’Or last January. It was his brilliant four-goal salvo against Sweden in the play-offs that made sure he won the vote ahead of Franck  Ribery and it also meant that he had  single-handedly secured Portugal’s passage to Brazil. After facing the United States in the tropical heat of Manaus, Bento’s team come up against Ghana on Thursday in Brasilia. They have not played two games of this importance since that double-header with Sweden and Ronaldo knows keeping Portugal in the competition beyond the group stage will also help him make it back to the podium for the World Player award next January. ‘When we have these decisive games we always respond. I hope that it will be like the Sweden matches,’ said Postiga. ‘We need to show the same spirit that got us here.’ As Ronaldo’s closest ally in the Portugal camp, he knows better than anyone that what really got Portugal to Brazil was Ronaldo at his best. ‘He is such an important player for us,’ he said. ‘We know he is the one who can really make the difference for us.’ Peering out: Ronaldo looks on before training in Campinas as Portugal prepare for their Group G match . There are times when it seems, much as with England circa 2002 with David Beckham, that other players in the squad are rather tired of the showbiz baggage that accompanies them because of the global standing of their best player. Beyond Real Madrid pals Fabio Coentrao and Pepe, and Postiga, who looks set to start up front with him against USA, affection towards Ronaldo is never hugely in evidence as Portugal are put through their paces. But his team-mates know they would not be in Brazil without him and that victory against Jurgen Klinsmann’s USA team depends largely on whether he can recapture his early-season form and do to the Americans what he did to Sweden in November.","Real Madrid forward is the centre of attention in Brazil .

"Controversy: the comments made by Mr Davies have been condemned as 'preposterous and embarrassing' The disabled should be allowed to work for less than the minimum wage to help them get jobs, a Tory MP has suggested. Philip Davies said that if people with disabilities or mental health problems could be paid   less than £5.93 an hour it would help them to compete better with the able-bodied in the employment market. His remarks prompted uproar, with Labour MP Dame Anne Begg, the wheelchair-bound chairman of the Commons work and pensions committee, branding them ‘outrageous and unacceptable’. Mental health charity Mind said they were ‘preposterous’. In a Commons debate on employment law, Mr Davies said: ‘The people who are most disadvantaged by the national minimum wage are the most vulnerable in society.’ London mayor Boris Johnson apologised yesterday after calling a Labour rival a ‘care in the community’ patient. When complaining that he was being . barracked in the London Assembly by John Biggs, Mr Johnson had said he . was the victim of ‘incoming [fire] from care in the community’. He told MPs he spoke to people with health problems who thought it ‘inevitable’ that someone without such difficulties would be taken on instead. He suggested they should be able to offer to work for less. His remarks were immediately challenged by fellow Right-wing Tory Edward Leigh, who demanded: ‘Why actually should a disabled person work for less than £5.93 an hour? It’s not a lot of money, is it?’ Mr Davies, MP for the Yorkshire constituency of Shipley, insisted: ‘If an employer is looking at two  candidates, one who has got disabilities and one who hasn’t, and they have got to pay them both the same rate, I invite you to guess which one the employer is more likely to take on.’ 'Discrimination': Campaigners say half working age people are still unable to access employment in this country . The . Equality Act, which replaced the Disability Discrimination Act last . October, aims to ensure employers do not discriminate against disabled . people. It provides legal rights for disabled . people in employment, education, access to goods and services, buying . and renting land and property, and functions of public bodies. But despite this, campaigners say half working age disabled people remain unable to access employment. Disabled charities also say disabled people in work earn less than their colleagues. Dame Anne said: ‘To suggest disabled people should be treated as second-class citizens is shocking and shows just what a warped world some Tories demonstrate they inhabit.’ Mind spokesman Sophie Corlett said: ‘People with mental health problems should not be considered a source of cheap labour.’ Mr Davies rejected the criticisms. He said: ‘Left-wing hysteria now dictates you can’t even repeat what people with learning disabilities tell you if it questions their shibboleths. ‘Anne Begg wasn’t even in the debate. She’s obviously drivelled before she knows what it’s about. ‘All I was doing was explaining what people with learning disabilities told me. ‘My whole point was, if those people themselves felt their chances would be encouraged by working below the minimum wage, they should be allowed to. ‘I didn’t and never would say that they should be forced to – it’s just that government shouldn’t stop them from doing so. ‘In no way would I ever say or think that people with disabilities are second class citizens.' Philip Davies has previously raised concerns after airing a number of outspoken views. The Conservative MP for Shipley, Yorkshire, wrote a series of letters in 2008 to equality chief Trevor Phillips asking if it offensive to 'black up' if impersonating a black person. Later the same year Mr Davies claimed the Equality and Human Rights Commission 'pay white staff more than ethnic minorities and men more than women'. The year before he told a Commons debate that 'most people who vote for the BNP are not racist'.",MP criticised for 'insulting' and 'embarrassing' views .

"The American veterinarian trapped in East Timor accused of drug trafficking has spent her 41st birthday in custody as the case looks set to drag on for years. Dr Stacey Addison claims she was sharing a taxi with a man who stopped to pick up a package - and police immediately swooped, arresting them all. It transpired the package contained methamphetamine, which  Dr Addison was unaware of, her mother claims. She was detained then released after five days - but then detained once more when she appeared in court. Despite a move to a women's unit in a cell with two English speakers, her mother has issued a desperate plea for support after her daughter turned 41 in detention on November 5. Birthday behind bars: Stacey Addison's mother Bernadette Kero (right) has appealed for help to release her daughter (left) who has spent her birthday in an East Timor prison cell . Distraught: She said it breaks her heart to know Stacey is locked up despite 'knowing nothing' of the case . In an open letter to her daughter on a Facebook group titled Help Stacey, Bernadette Kero, wrote: 'Stacey, if only I could talk to you. You are on my mind every second of the day. It breaks my heart to think of you spending your birthday in prison. My only wish is for you to be free. You don't deserve any of this.' She has received two short notes from her daughter via the US Embassy, Kero explained, which reveal she has been able to communicate with the Cuba-trained doctors in Spanish and the prison staff are friendly. 'I spent my birthday at the clinic being treated for an abscess, most of the doctors study in Cuba so luckily for me, speak Spanish,' one of the notes read. The new cell permits one-hour visits twice a week, plus visits from her lawyer and U.S. Embassy envoys. She has been granted a mattress and can go outside for two hours a day - an improvement on her previous detainment. There are 17 women in the unit and one baby, 18 months old. UC Berkeley grad Dr Stacey Addison was seized while traveling from Indonesian territory to independent East Timor on September 5. The vet spent five terrifying days in jail and was forced to surrender her passport. She was optimistic about her release when she appeared in court on September 24 - but instead they detained her once more. In flux: 40-year-old Portland, Oregon veterinarian Dr. Stacey Addison was detained in East Timor and set free, but authorities took her passport and expect her to stay in the country during a probe that could take a year . Drug charge: Addison says a man she shared a taxi with on September 5 was caught with a package of methamphetamine and she was arrested along with him . The 40-year-old from Portland, Oregon has now been trying to get home for weeks. She's been in contact with American news outlets via Skype despite her shaky internet connection. 'I'm a suspect in a crime I didn't commit,' she told KGO shortly before the court case: 'I don't know what's going to happen with the case, so it just makes everything really scary.' Authorities in East Timor strip-searched Addison and took a urine sample upon her arrest. She says she knew she had no drugs and that her drug test would be negative, so at first she wasn't too worried. 'I thought, OK, I haven't done anything. It should be OK. But it's not,' she told KOIN. After days of sleeping on a floor with 13 other women in jail and her subsequent release without a passport, the worry set in. Initial pleas to the U.S. Embassy were fruitless because diplomats aren't allowed to interfere with a foreign crime investigation. Holding out hope: Addison, who's often traveled abroad to do volunteer work as a vet, has been in touch with American media via a shaky internet connection. She says she's been in contact with her U.S. Senator and some diplomatic officials . 'I haven't committed a crime, I've done nothing wrong and the facts will prove that,' she said, but, 'their system is different here in that they have a long period to investigate and I'm sort of stuck in this.' While things appeared hopeless, by Tuesday leaders from both the state of Oregon and from East Timor had become 'aware of the situation' according to what Addison told KOIN. In addition to the foreign minister and prime minister, Addison said she's in touch with the office of U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley's office via email and hopes the case will be resolved sooner rather than later. She said she's been told such investigations are known to take up to a year. 'I'm not asking that they have special treatment,' she said. 'I'm just asking that they look at the evidence. There isn't any evidence.'","UC Berkeley grad Dr Stacey Addison was traveling from Indonesian territory to independent East Timor when she was arrested on Sept 5 .

"U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger ordered contingency plans drawn up nearly 40 years ago to attack Cuba, incensed over the small island's deployment of troops to Angola, according to declassified government documents posted online Wednesday. In several White House meetings, Kissinger advocated for strong action to stop Castro, fearful that his incursion in Africa was making the U.S. look weak. He argued that Cuba's actions were driving fears around the world of a wider race war that could spill over into Latin America and even destabilize the Middle East. In a series of contingency plans that followed, options ranged from a military blockade to airstrikes and mining of Cuban ports. 'I would be in favor of clobbering them': In several White House meetings in 1976, then-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger advocated for strong action to stop Fidel Castro, fearful that his incursion in Africa was making the U.S. look weak. Castro sent troops to Angola in 1975 . Historic: President Gerald Ford (right) leans close to his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (left) to hear some words of diplomatic wisdom from the Middle East peace-seeker in August 1975 . 'Smash him': Kissinger feared that Fidel Castro (pictured) had humiliated the U.S. by sending troops to Angola . But the documents also warned of heavy risks, including a wider conflict with the Soviet Union and a ground war to defend the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay. 'I think we are going to have to smash Castro. I don't think we can do it before the election,' Kissinger told President Gerald R. Ford, according to a transcript of a Feb. 25, 1976 meeting in the Oval Office. Ford replied: 'I agree.' Jimmy Carter ultimately won the 1976 presidential election. Kissinger, who had returned from a trip to Latin America, and told Ford that leaders in the region 'are scared to death about Cuba. They are afraid of a race war.' The documents were declassified by the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library at the request of the National Security Archive, which published them online Wednesday. An account of the episode is being published in a new book, Back Channel to Cuba, written by William M. LeoGrande, a professor at American University, and Peter Kornbluh, director of the Cuban Documentation Project at the National Security Archive. At another Oval Office meeting on March 15, 1976, Kissinger said 'even the Iranians are worried about the Cubans getting into the Middle East countries. I think we have to humiliate them. If they move into Namibia or Rhodesia, I would be in favor of clobbering them.' Secretary of State Henry Kissinger during a meeting of the Senate Finance Committee discussing the Trade Reform Bill in December 1974 . Nine days later, Kissinger chaired a high-level 'Special Actions Group Meeting' at the White House Situation Room to discuss options. 'If there is a perception overseas that we are so weakened by our internal debate so that it looks like we can't do anything about a country of 8 million people, then in three or four years we are going to have a real crisis,' Kissinger said. The contingency plans outlined military options from blocking outgoing Cuban ships carrying troops and war material to airstrikes against Cuban bases and airfields. The documents discussed risks, including the possibility that the Soviet Union would thwart a blockade by seizing or sinking ships. 'Escalation to general war could result,' one document said. The contingency plans sounded a cautious note about what sort of Cuban provocation would trigger a U.S. military response. They stated that while the 'threshold' should be low if Cuba moves against U.S. territories, it should be 'highest' for Africa.","Then-U.S. Secretary of State angered by Fidel Castro's decision to send troops into Angola in 1975 .

"Ousted: Pastor Juan McFarland still has the keys to the Alabama church despite being voted out . An Alabama pastor made a sermon on Sunday despite being ousted by church leaders following revelations he was HIV positive, used illegal drugs, and misspent church funds. Pastor Juan McFarland led Sunday morning's worship at Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Montgomery for a congregation of 50 who encouraged him during his sermon. The Montgomery Advertiser reports that on Wednesday  retired Shiloh deacon Nathan Williams Jr. said McFarland admitted in a church sermon that he has been HIV positive since 2008 and even engaged in sexual acts with church members while knowingly having then disease. Church members were surprised to see McFarland on Sunday after church leaders voted 80-2 to oust him from the church following news of his misdoings. Only 50 members showed up on Sunday for a service that usually hosts about 160. AL.com reports that Nathan Williams is suing to remove McFarland but that McFarland will stay in the pulpit for now. McFarland has been Shiloh's pastor for 24 years and in Sunday's sermon referenced biblical stories that referenced the power of prayer and sudden healing. He spoke about a story in the book of Matthew in which a faithful old man calls upon Jesus to heal his servant with leprosy. 'His servant was healed that same hour,' McFarland said. 'Jesus did it suddenly.' A male in the congregation yelled out in support, 'Preach it, reverend!' 'Sometimes the worst times in our lives is when we have a midnight situation, and we are in a midnight situation,' McFarland told churchgoers. 'When you pray, you've got to forgive. You can't go down on your knees hating somebody, or wishing something bad will happen to somebody, he added. McFarland told the story of Luke in which a woman pushes her way through the crowd to touch Jesus' garment and is then suddenly healed of her illness. Shocking: McFarland, pictured delivering a sermon at the church earlier this year, revealed that he had taken cocaine while pastor, misused church funds for trips he didn't take and had sex with churchgoers . 'Press your way through the crowd. Pass your way through the naysayers,' McFarland said. The church's missionary president Annette Russell spoke to the congregation about McFarland's confessions and reminded them that they must have compassion. 'He's a man of God, but he's a human being,' she said of McFarland. 'It's not that we condone what our pastor has done, but we need to have compassion. We're not supposed to assassinate our brothers and sisters. We're not supposed to judge. We do our business at Shiloh. It didn't have to be expressed in the papers or on television.' Julian McPhillips who is one of the lawyers representing the church has said that McFarland is having trouble facing the reality that he's been voted out of the church. 'He is a bit of a strong-willed guy,' said McPhillips, who on Friday met with major elders of the church. 'He's refusing to face the reality of what the congregation has voted.' 'He's trying to exercise dictatorial powers,' said McPhillips of McFarland. 'He's living in a dream world.' At the end of Sunday's sermon McFarland broke out in song singing The Lord is My Sovereign as crying members of the congregation embraced him. McFarland first revealed to worshipers in mid-September that he had contracted HIV in 2003 and was diagnosed with AIDS in 2008. Scene: After being removed from the church in Montgomery, Alabama (pictured), McFarland still has the keys to the church doors and gave a sermon on Sunday . Whether or not he told all of his sexual partners that he had HIV or AIDS is yet to be determined, but one church-goer said she would be undergoing tests to see if she had the disease, WSFA reported. 'My heart goes out to her because she's been a wonderful church member, and then for something like this to happen,' the church member said. 'The fact that he didn't tell them at all. That's a crime in itself.' A former Shiloh deacon who heard his sermons told AL.com that McFarland is not taking medicine to treat his illness. After his most recent sermons, deacons voted on October 5 to remove him as pastor. On the Sunday following the allegations,  Montgomery police were called after church members started fighting with each other but no one was removed. Williams said he thinks police were called on people who had voted the pastor out. 'Our moves are going to come directly from counsel. We want peace and we want to do things right, legally,' Williams said. 'We are not looking to hurt him. We are looking to get the church back.' McFarland is also the Moderator with the Alabama Middle District Baptist Association, which includes 34 churches.","Juan McFarland has been removed from Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama after deacons voted unanimously to oust him .

"A madam-turned-candidate who ran against former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer in the city comptroller's race last year has been sentenced to two years in prison for selling prescription drugs illegally. Federal Judge Edgardo Ramos sentenced a tearful, bleached blonde Kristin Davis after she apologized to the court on Wednesday. The newly licensed cosmetologist asked for leniency. She said a prison sentence would cause her to lose her apartment and threaten her license. Drug dealer and madame: Former Manhattan madam Kristin Davis arrives for her sentencing hearing at U.S. District Court in Manhattan where she was convicted of dealing prescription drugs . Eliot Spitzer's madame: Kristin Davis has said she supplied hookers to former Governor Eliot Spitzer who is pictured here with his ex-wife Silda in 2008 . The judge noted that she committed a second crime almost as soon as she was off probation from her first offense. The New York Daily News reports that the judge told her that she had both a caring family and professional success and had no reason other than greed to sell oxycodone, amphetamines, and muscle relaxers. 'The fact of the matter is you should not be standing here. You know better,” Judge Edgardo Ramos told Davis in Manhattan Federal Court. 'You involved yourself in this for no apparent reason but greed.' Davis pleaded guilty in 2008 to promoting prostitution and spent four months in jail. The same year, Spitzer resigned as governor in an escort-service controversy. In and out of the courtroom:  Kristin Davis leaves Manhattan federal court in New York last year around the time she was arrested for peddling powerful prescription medications . Guilty: Kristen Davis, a one-time madam who ran against Elliott Spitzer in the New York City comptroller race last year, walks away from federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday after being sentenced . She was arrested for selling prescription drugs to an FBI informant last year. Davis told the judge that she was trying to straighten out her life by starting a career in cosmetology. She said she only started dealing drugs after suffering for four months in Riker's Island where she served time for promoting prostitution. 'One hour inside of Rikers in solitary confinement was hell,' Davis said, tearing up. 'I came out of four months in solitary with a lot of issues. She was also sentenced to two years supervised released and both mental health and drug treatment. The judge made Davis give up $1,765 which is the value of the pills she sold from January to April of last year. Davis has claimed that she was Eliot Spitzer's go to Madame when he wanted a hooker. Last year she ran as city controller against both Elliot Spitzer and Scott Stringer. Her campaign, though a longshot, was stifled when she was arrested for selling drugs in August. Davis has said she looks forward to continuing her career as a cosmetologist once she gets out of prison.

"Even without a scrap of make-up, Renee Zellweger looked unrecognizable when she was spotted over the weekend for the first time since last Monday's ELLE Style Awards. The 45-year-old Bridget Jones actress - who has dismissed surgery speculations as 'silly' - appeared somewhat tired and anxious as she ran errands over the weekend in Mississippi, where she is about to start filming her latest movie, Same Kind Of Different As Me. When quizzed by the paparazzi over all the media attention surrounding her face, Renee, as she climbed into her car, replied: 'Oh my God, you're going to ask me that question! Can you excuse me please? I have better things to do and I'm sure you do too.' Is that really you? Even without a scrap of make-up, Renee Zellweger looked unrecognizable when she was spotted over the weekend for the first time since last Monday's ELLE Style Awards . The actress, whose shocking new look has sent commentators into a frenzy of speculation over what sort of cosmetic procedures she may have had done, politely declined to answer any further questions as she prepared to drive off. 'I'd just like to have my day to myself if you don't mind,' she said. Her make-up free face put to bed any speculation that perhaps her unusual new look last week was a result of make-up trickery. Renee has since dismissed web-chatter over her so-called surgery as 'silly.' 'It seems the folks who come digging around for some nefarious truth, which doesn't exist won't get off my porch until I answer the door,' she told People. 'I'm glad folks think I look different! I'm living a different, happy, more fulfilling life, and I'm thrilled that perhaps it shows.' Upper-eye lift? The Oscar winner shocked fans last Monday with her startlingly different face at the ELLE Women in Hollywood Awards. Pictured (left) last week and (right) as Bridget Jones in 2001 . New look: Renee wore her hair scraped back into a scruffy bundle atop her head and seemed to have broken out with a cold sore on her upper lip . Back off: When quizzed by the paparazzi over all the media attention surrounding her face, Renee replied, 'Oh my God you're going to ask me that question! Can you excuse me please?' No jowls here: Renee's jawline is unusually pronounced and tight for a woman of 45 . Running errands: Her make-up free face put to bed any speculation that perhaps her unusual new look last week was a result of make-up trickery . What surgery? Last week, Renee dismissed web-chatter over her so-called surgery as 'silly' Greetings: She said, 'It seems the folks who come digging around for some nefarious truth, which doesn't exist won't get off my porch until I answer the door' MailOnline spoke to Beverly Hills-based plastic surgeon Dr. Randal Haworth to get his theory on the matter. 'In my opinion, Renee underwent a blepharoplasty which entails removing the perceived excess amount of eyelid skin and fat from the area between the eyebrow and the upper eyelash,' he says. 'The resulting scar will be hidden within the normal upper eyelid crease which is a natural curve. However, one could not see this natural curve in Renée prior to surgery since all we saw was a straight sheet of skin starting from her nose to the outside of her eye itself. 'Though the procedure was performed conservatively, it unveiled her eyes which were ""hiding"" behind this drape of skin.' There she is! Only when she smiles do we catch a glimpse of the spirited old Renee we once knew . Casual: The Case 39 actress - who has been romancing Doyle Bramhall II since 2012 - said she's spent the past few years 'making a home,' 'loving someone,' and 'growing into myself' Flattered: Renee also said last week, 'I'm glad folks think I look different! I'm living a different, happy, more fulfilling life, and I'm thrilled that perhaps it shows' What's so funny? According to celebrity make-up artist Rachel Wood, whose clients include Mariah Carey and Louise Roe, the star 'clearly has had some work done' Dr Haworth elaborated: 'Renee's defining trademark characteristic was her small, squinty eyes, which complemented her quirky personality perfectly. 'Now that it is gone, she is unrecognizable. Additionally, she has lost some subcutaneous facial fat during her absence from the public spotlight which can be attributed to normal aging. To summarize, it's not that she looks bad at all, it's just that she looks different.' New York-based plastic surgeon Dr Robert Guida went as far as to say Renee's presumed surgery is an improvement. 'It seems pretty obvious she had a blepharoplasty. She also seems to have had Botox injections to smooth her forehead and possibly fillers to cheek and midface area,' he tells MailOnline. 'I felt she always needed the upper eyelid lift, even years ago. I think she looks much better and the procedure was a success. 'She does not look overdone, but she does look different because, she had such heavy upper eyelids for so long.' Edward Dutton, a professor of Finnish Culture at Oulu University in Finland points out that Renee's eyes were actually formally an important characteristic of her partly 'eastern' heritage. 'The reason Renee looked distinguished is because she is an unusual genetic mixture, with a Swiss father and a mother who is part Kven and part Sami. 'This, in turns, means that, rather like Icelandic singer Björk - whose ancestry is Inuit - she has an 'eastern' face... and has had plastic surgery which makes her look less Sami, less Kven, and more stereotypically 'North European.' He adds: 'How sad. She was so much more beautiful and interesting when she had the courage to be Sami and Kven.' Different woman: Last week, apart from her ultra line-free forehead and suspiciously puffy face, she also had much lighter and patchier eyebrows than usual . There's no denying it: The star's appearance has changed dramatically over the years . The Case 39 actress - who's been romancing Doyle Bramhall II since 2012 - said she's spent the past few years 'making a home,' 'loving someone,' and 'growing into myself.' 'My friends say that I look peaceful. I am healthy,' Zellweger insisted. 'For a long time I wasn't doing such a good job with that. I took on a schedule that is not realistically sustainable and didn't allow for taking care of myself. 'Rather than stopping to recalibrate, I kept running until I was depleted and made bad choices about how to conceal the exhaustion. I was aware of the chaos and finally chose different things.' The star was at ELLE's 21st annual Women In Hollywood Awards at the Four Seasons Hotel in California when she debuted her new look, prompting fans to voice their concern. Apart from her ultra line-free forehead and suspiciously puffy face, she also had much lighter and patchier eyebrows than usual. According to celebrity make-up artist Rachel Wood, whose clients include Mariah Carey and Louise Roe, the star 'clearly has had some work done'. She told MailOnline: 'The texture of her skin looks like she has gone a little too far with a chemical peel as its texture looks very smooth and plastic-like shiny, yet the color on top looks like the remnants of fake tan.' Ms Wood added: 'She is known for cute but heavy lidded eyes and it appears as though she has had some sort of lift, maybe a bit of Botox by the brow as well to open up her eyes. I am all for a secret nip and tuck but in small doses, so you still look like a fresher, rested version of you… not an unrecognizable one.' The shapelessness of her brows merely serves to further 'distort' the new frame of her face, says Ms Wood.","Plastic surgeon Dr. Randal Haworth suggests Renee has undergone a blepharoplasty .

"They may look like ancient aliens, but these strange fossilised creatures are a distant relative of humans. More than 100 years after they were discovered, experts have identified the fossils as vetulicolians – blind marine creatures that swam 500 million years ago. They believe that the ancient animals are among humans’ distant cousins because they had a rod through their tail similar to a backbone. This 500-million-year-old fossil has been used by Australian researchers to make their discovery about vetulicolians. These marine creatures had a rod through their tail similar to a backbone, which places them as distant cousins of vertebrate animals, they claim . Researchers at the University of Adelaide in Australia, explained that the marine creatures were 'filter-feeders' shaped like a figure-of-8. Their strange anatomy has meant that no-one has been able to place them accurately on the tree of life, until now. In a new paper published in BMC Evolutionary Biology, they argue that the alien-like animals should be placed within the same group that includes vertebrate animals, because of a ‘rod’ structure in their anatomy. ‘Although not directly related to humans in the evolutionary line, we can confirm that these ancient water creatures are among our distant cousins,’ said lead author of the paper, Dr Diego Garcia-Bellido, of the university's Environment Institute. An artists's impression of the 500-million-year-old marine creatures known as vetulicolians, now believed to be distant cousins of vertebrate animals such as humans and fish. Scientists say these blind 'filter feeders' were once abundant throughout the world . It may seem strange that a blind marine creature shaped like the number eight could be an ancient relative of humans. But scientists say vetulicolians, which lived 500 million years ago, are a distant cousin of humans because they had a rod through their tails. This rod resembles a notochord, which is the precursor of the backbone and is unique to vertebrates and their relatives. This has lead experts to argue that the creatures should be placed within the same group that includes vertebrate animals, such as humans. ‘They are close relatives of vertebrates - animals with backbones, such as ourselves. ‘Vetulicolians have a long tail supported by a stiff rod. This rod resembles a notochord, which is the precursor of the backbone and is unique to vertebrates and their relatives,’ he said. Although the first specimens were studied in 1911, it took until 1997 for the fossils to be described as a group on their own: the vetulicolians. These fossils have now been discovered in countries all across the globe, such as Canada, Greenland, China and Australia. The latest insights into vetulicolians have come from new fossils discovered on Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia. ‘Vetulicolians are further evidence that life was very rich in diversity during the Cambrian period, in some aspects more than it is today, with many extra branches on the evolutionary tree,’ Dr Garcia-Bellido said. ‘They were simple yet successful creatures, large in number and in distribution across the globe, and one of the first representatives of our cousins, which include sea squirts and salps.’ In the evolutionary tree, Australian researchers have now grouped the mysterious, extinct creatures known as vetulicolians on a branch alongside vertebrate animals. Although not in the same direct evolutionary line, this places the 500-million-year-old marine creatures as distant cousins of humans .","Fossils were discovered 100 years ago but remained a mystery until recently .

"Just days before Josh Densten celebrated his 27th birthday his whole life was turned upside down . Just days before Josh Densten celebrated his 27th birthday his whole life was turned upside down. Diagnosed with adult-onset type 1 diabetes, The Block contestant thought life would never be the same as he tried to process the shocking news given to him by his local Doctor in Melbourne nearly a year and a half ago. Rather than letting the diagnosis bring him down, Josh, who is now 28, vowed to take a positive approach and has committed himself to educating others on the condition. 'There are a lot of worse things that could have happened and I am lucky to have been diagnosed later in life,' Josh told Daily Mail Australia. But that was not the Melbourne plumber's initial reaction to his life-threatening condition. Having never known anyone with diabetes and having no awareness of the condition, it took five weeks before Josh took warning signs seriously. 'At the start it was very gradual', he said. 'I was very thirsty and it got worse and worse until it was unquenchable. 'I was urinating quite a lot because it was my body's way of releasing my high blood sugar - I was drinking litres of water every 10 minutes.' By the time Josh went to the Doctor his blood sugar levels were at 35, when recommended blood sugar levels are generally between four and eight. 'The Doctor told me I made it just in time', Josh said. 'In a few more weeks it could have been really serious. 'Luckily there was no damage to my kidneys and eyes'. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas stops making insulin,  preventing the body from turning sugar into energy. If sufferers do not treat themselves with daily injections of insulin, the condition could potentially be life threatening. Unlike type 2 diabetes, Josh's condition has no cause but can often be linked to family history. Josh with fellow contestant Dan Reilly (left) from The Block All-Stars in 2013 . When Josh, 28, was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetes he thought he would never be able to do the things he loved again, like eating a burger or drinking a beer . When Josh first discovered he had type 1 diabetes he was in complete shock - diabetes did not run in his family. 'I asked the doctor, ""How do I get rid of it?"" - I wasn't aware of what diabetes was, I didn't know anything about it. Josh and his wife Jenna were both contestants on Channel 9's reality show, The Block, in 2011 and 2013 . 'They said, ""You can't get rid of it, you'll have it the rest of your life"". 'It was hard for me, I was thinking, ""Can I ever do the things I love again?"". 'Playing sport, drinking beer or even going for a burger - all the things I thought I could never do because I had no information about diabetes.' Although there is no cure for type 1 diabetes, Josh discovered it is very manageable. Through maintaining a healthy lifestyle, regularly testing his blood glucose levels and injecting himself with insulin, Josh describes living a life that is close to 'normal'. 'I now have to have about five to six injections a day - I'm not a huge fan of needles but after a year and a half I have become used to it. 'To be honest, nothing has changed but I am a bit more cautious,' he said. 'If I am going down the street I need to make sure I have lollies on me - if I don't I am always freaking out - I am worried my blood sugar is going to drop and I will black out. 'I also DJ on the side and in front of hundreds of people I worry about that. 'If anything having diabetes has pushed me to do more exercise, travel more and enjoy life.' Josh said he considers himself fortunate when compared to the 'five-year-old-boys who are woken up by their mothers in the middle of the night for insulin shots because they are too young to tackle it alone.' The Block star puts his strength down to the support of his wife Jenna and his mum, who has Google alerts for diabetes on her phone. Most weekends Josh and Jenna, who appeared on The Block in 2011 and 2013, stay active by walking into Melbourne's city, rather than driving their car. 'I am also really lucky to be a plumber because it keeps me active and I am able to have regular and organised meals. The Block star puts his strength down to the support of his wife Jenna . Josh, who is a plumber in Melbourne, DJ's on the side. He said he always has to have lollies on him because he is afraid his blood sugar levels will drop and he will black out . Through maintaining a healthy lifestyle, regularly testing his blood glucose levels and injecting himself with insulin, Josh describes living a life that is close to 'normal' Josh walks his little dogs everyday to stay active, whether its going for a run around the block or taking them to the park close by . 'I try to ride my bike or walk to work as much as I can and I also have little dogs so if I am sitting on the couch they always make me feel guilty,' he said. Josh, who is an ambassador for Diabetes Australia, is urging people to take part in the Walk to Work Day campaign. The campaign  encourages people to get walking and raise awareness on the benefits of exercise  to help reduce the risk of diabetes, together with healthy eating. Josh, who is an ambassador for Diabetes Australia, is urging people to take park in the Walk to Work Day campaign . The end of the campaign will also mark World Diabetes Day on Friday 14 November, when Australian's are asked to walk at least one kilometre of their journey to work that day. 'I think it is a good idea to plant the seed that people don't have drive to work all the time or even for them to just learn to get off one train stop earlier. 'Even though I ride to work and it is a lot quicker, when I walk I can actually enjoy my time, unwind and see people, rather than just staring at your phone on the train.' Josh hopes this campaign can help spread awareness across Australia and raise money to help find a cure. 'Ideally it would be great to find a cure, but for now I just want people to know how deadly it can be and how important it is to stay active and healthy,' Josh said. Diabetes Australia estimates that 1.7 million Australians suffer from diabetes, while half of the cases of type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed. Around 280 Australians develop diabetes everyday and more than 100,000 Australians have developed the condition in the past year. For more information on Diabetes Australia Walk to Work Day, visit their website. Type 1 diabetes: . *Occurs when the pancreas does not produce insulin . *Represents 10–15 per cent of all cases of diabetes . *Is one of the most common chronic childhood conditions . *Onset is usually abrupt and symptoms are obvious . *Symptoms can include excessive thirst and urination, unexplained weight loss, weakness and fatigue and blurred vision . Type 2 diabetes: . *Occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin and/or the insulin does not work effectively and/or the cells of the body do not respond to insulin effectively (known as insulin resistance) *Represents 85–90 per cent of all cases of diabetes . *Usually develops in adults over the age of 45 years but is increasingly occurring in younger age groups including children, adolescents and young adults . *Is more likely in people with a family history of type 2 diabetes or from particular ethnic backgrounds . *For some the first sign may be a complication of diabetes such as a heart attack, vision problems or a foot ulcer . *Is managed with a combination of regular physical activity, healthy eating and weight reduction. As type 2 diabetes is often progressive, most people will need oral medications and/or insulin injections in addition to lifestyle changes over time.

"These stunning pictures show the undisturbed wrecks left from the two World Wars and now resting deep beneath the sea. Military vehicles from the First and Second World War also lie on the sea bed while one of the giant vessels is thought to contain millions of pounds worth of gold bars. Photographer Steve Jones, 43, from Aberdare, South Wales, took the  underwater shots while on a dive at Malin Head, off the coast of Donegal, Ireland. A diver exams part of the SS Laurentic (pictured) which lies underwater at Malin Head was on her way to America at the height of the First World War when she struck two mines and sunk in 40m of water, killing more than 350 of her crew . Diver Steve Jones took stunning pictures of undisturbed wrecks lying on the bottom of the sea. This image shows part of the First World War Super-Dreadnought class HMS Audacious, which hit a German mine before sinking on October 27 1914 . One of the sunken vessels was SS Empire Heritage which was carrying a huge cargo of war materials including these Sherman Tanks during the Second World War. The wreck lies 67m below the surface at Malin Head, off the coast of Donegal in Ireland . One of the ships, the SS Laurentic, was sunk while sailing to America during the First World War and was carrying 43 tons of gold ingots to pay for war ship supplies. Much of it has already been recovered, and although Mr Jones, who has nearly 30 years of diving experience, and his team had a look for the remaining 20 bars - worth almost £6million - they could not find the underwater treasure. The four wrecks captured in Mr Jones's stunning images show HMS Audacious, SS Justicia, SS Laurentic and Empire Heritage, which were all sunk during World War One and Two. A diver exams the wreck of SS Justicia which was torpedoed by the German U-Boat UB-124 killing 16 men. It was one of the largest ships sunk in the First World War . The 32,234 ton White Star Liner Justicia (pictured) was used as a troopship in the First World War. This image shows the vast foredeck, with capstans pushed up through the collapsing deck while a diver examines the interior . Justicia (pictured) now lies 72m below the surface off Malin Head. The area has become extremely popular with divers over the years . SS Laurentic, SS Justicia and HMS Audacious were all sunk off Malin Head during the First World War while SS Empire Heritage went down during the Second World War . He said: 'We only had about 30 minutes down at the deepest point of each dive, as there is a very real risk of getting the bends. 'Malin Head is one of the most special places I've ever dived. 'The sailors that died on these ships during the two world wars made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the vital supply routes between the UK and USA remained open.' Justicia was sailing from Belfast to New York when she was torpedoed by the German Type III Coastal U-boat UB-64 under the control of Otto von Schrader. Photographer Steve Jones, 43, from Aberdare, South Wales, took underwater shots of SS Justicia (left) and SS Laurentic (right) while on a dive at Malin Head, off the coast of Donegal, Ireland . One of the ships, the SS Laurentic (pictured), was sunk while sailing to America during the First World War and was carrying 43 tons of gold ingots to pay for war ship supplies . Much of the gold has already been recovered from SS Laurentic, but 20 bars are believed to still be buried in the hold worth almost £6million . The SS Laurentic (pictured), was sunk in 1917 while sailing to America during the First World War killing more than 350 crew members on board . HMS Audacious (pictured) was a King George V-class battleship of the Royal Navy which was sunk by a German naval mine off the northern coast of Donegal in 1914 . A number of Sherman tanks lie underwater off Malin Head after they went down as they were being transported by SS Empire Heritage . It was 23 miles south of Skerryvore, Scotland when it went down in July 1918 killing 16 crew members. Its wreck lies 28 miles north-west of Malin Head, Ireland 70m below the surface. The 15,000-ton SS Empire Heritage was a  steam tanker on her way from New York to Liverpool carrying a huge cargo of war materials including Sherman Tanks when it was struck by a torpedo in 1944, 15 miles off the coast of Donegal. It was en route from New York to Liverpool when it was targeted by U-482. More than a hundred crew members were killed when she went down. HMS Audacious was a King George V-class battleship of the Royal Navy which was sunk by a German naval mine off the northern coast of Donegal in 1914. The mighty bow of one of the ships lies on the seabed, while a diver makes his way along the side using a torch to find his way in the darkness . Sherman Tanks lie entangled with trucks, spread across the wreck of SS Empire Heritage 67 metres below the surface . Laurentic was on her way to America at the height of the First World War when she struck two mines and sunk in 40m of water, killing more than 350 of her crew. The sinking happened in January 1917 and sparked an urgent recovery of the gold that had been stored on board. Mr Jones said: 'HMS Audacious was one of the most powerful warships the world had ever seen at the time. It was sunk by a mine during WW1 and lies in 65 metres of water. It was amazing to see it so up close. 'Another WW1 liner SS Laurentic was en route to the USA she struck 2 mines and sunk in 40m of water, killing over 350 of her crew. The seas off the North Irish coast are well known as being a mass graveyard for First and Second World War ships and submarines. During the First World War, the area was a key strategic route for Allied navies and was used to keep important trade routes running, including to America. The British fleet suffered heavy losses in what became known as the Atlantic U-boat campaign, with nearly half of Britain's merchant marine fleet destroyed during the course of the war by German torpedoes or mines. During six years of intense action in the Battle of the Atlantic, ships would often be clustered in the coastal waters. As a result of the heavy shipping traffic, the area became a prime target for Nazi U-boats (pictured) As well as First World War vessels, the seabed to the north of Ireland and west of Scotland is also the resting place of a number of ships sunk during the Second World War. Allied convoys regularly passed the area on their way to and from the large ports at Glasgow and Liverpool. During six years of intense action in the Battle of the Atlantic, ships would often be clustered in the coastal waters nearby and as a result of the heavy shipping traffic, the Nazis saw it as a crucial target. But it also became a deadly place to be for German U-boats which were vulnerable to aircarft near land as well as Royal Navy vessels. 'In her holds were 43 tons of gold ingots to pay for war supplies. 'Recovery of the gold was top priority but to this day 20 bars remain unaccounted for, which are worth nearly £6million. Mr Jones said: 'Due to the exposed location and depth, only divers trained in the use of mixed gas (use of helium mixed in with our breathing gas) can operate safely at these depths. 'Malin Head has become legendary among this community of ""technical divers"" as having some of the best wrecks in the world. It is an amazing feeling to be able to photograph some of these amazing historical wrecks.'","Stunning photographs show the ghostly images of First World War and Second World War ships off coast of Ireland .

"Robbie Kingsford was attacked in a homophobic hate crime on Saturday morning in Surbiton . Two thugs wearing pink tutus are being hunted by police after launching a savage homophobic attack on passers-by outside a YMCA. The men were sitting outside the hostel with three women in the early hours when they began hurling gay abuse at their two victims, aged 18 and 21. The attackers approached the two men and punched one before kicking and stamping on the other, who had fallen to the floor while trying to intervene. The victim who was punched suffered minor facial injuries, while the other - named by a local newspaper as Robbie Kingsford, 21, after his father Brian posted an appeal for witnesses and a picture of his son's injuries on Facebook - was taken to hospital with head injuries and was later discharged. The attack in Surbiton, Surrey, on Saturday morning, is being treated as a homophobic hate crime, although no arrests have yet been made. The first suspect is described as a short, white man, in his late twenties, with fair hair, shaven and a muscular build and was wearing a pink tutu. The second attack is also a white man in his late twenties, with brown short hair and also wearing a pink tutu. The YMCA in Surbiton, Surrey, was the scene of an alleged homophobic attack on Saturday . Trainee Detective Constable Ann-Marie Hodgkiss said: 'This was a violent and unprovoked hate crime and I am appealing for anyone with any information about the incident to contact me. 'The two suspects were distinctively dressed, probably due to Halloween, and I would urge anyone who recognises their description and who may know who they are to contact me and help us trace them.'","Men in pink tutus hurled gay abuse at two men before assaulting them .

"A driver who was trying to hide her identity from cops said that she was 22 and only looked older because she had a medical condition that made her age faster, according to a police report. Jennifer Crosby, 43, was driving through Indian River County, Florida on a suspended license when she was pulled over by a police officer for broken tail lights. When she was asked to hand over her license and other documents, she told the officer she had forgotten her purse, according to the police report shared by The Smoking Gun. She then claimed her name was Christina Topp and that she had been born on March 16, 1992. Arrest: Jennifer Crosby, 43, (pictured left in her mug shot and right with her daughter) pretended to be the 22-year-old woman when she was pulled over while driving on a suspended license, police said . But the officer, Deputy Colby Smith, wrote in the report: 'Immediately I was suspicious because the driver appeared significantly older than that.' She even gave a social security number that matched with the identity - but when the officer checked a database that showed a photo of Topp, it was clear the two women were not the same person. In fact, the woman she had claimed to be was her daughter. 'She admitted that her name was Jennifer R. Crosby and she gave me her daughter’s name because her driver's license was suspended,' the report noted. She was arrested for driving on a suspended license and providing a false name and booked into the county jail, where she remains on bond of $4,000. 'Lies': Crosby, pictured, claimed that she had a condition that made her appear older than she actually was - but police weren't buying it. She remains in jail after being arrested for providing a false name . The arrest comes just months after she was arrested for possession of crack cocaine, which she had hidden inside her vagina in a piece of foil. When cops conducting a search asked her if she had any drugs on her person, she admitted that she had cocaine inside of her. But when she pulled them out, she screamed in pain and said: 'The foil is hurting the inside of my vagina', according to a police report.","Jennifer Crosby 'was driving on a suspended license when she was pulled over for broken tail lights - and pretended to be her 22-year-old daughter'

"Cancer-stricken Toronto Mayor Rob Ford revealed that he is not 'very good' as he appeared at the ballots on Tuesday to vote for his brother in the city's upcoming mayoral elections. Ford, who was engulfed in controversy last year after he was caught on video smoking a crack pipe, is just coming off his second round of chemotherapy treatment for a rare form of cancer. The mayor, whose blond hair has been thinned by the treatment, had intended to run for re-election on October 27 but after his cancer diagnosis, he pulled out of the race and his brother Doug, a city councilor, took over his place. At the ballots on Tuesday, he said he was feeling tired but wanted to support his brother. Supportive: Mayor Rob Ford, who has just finished his second round of chemo for a rare and aggressive cancer, casts his ballot for his brother during advance voting for the Toronto Municipal Elections on Tuesday . Battle: Ford, 45, told reporters that he is tired and not feeling very good following his second chemo treatment . Struggle: Ford, who was diagnosed with cancer after returning to work following a stint in rehab for alcohol and drug addiction this summer, has been given just a 50 per cent chance of survival . Despite dropping his mayoral bid, Rob Ford is still running for his old council seat. He returns to hospital for another round of chemotherapy on October 29. CBC reported that Ford began chemo treatments in September shortly after doctors found signs of malignant liposarcoma in his abdomen. Liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue cancer that begins in fat cells, or fatty tissue, and occurs most often in older adults. Disappointed: Ford had refused to step down after his drug scandal but his diagnosis has now forced him to . Troubled: The mayor, pictured waiting for an elevator after casting his vote on Tuesday, had to pull out of the mayoral elections following the diagnosis and his brother is running for office instead . Fighter: Ford's blond hair appears much thinner and patchy than before his treatment, right . The cancer is extremely rare, affecting only about 2.5 people for every million, and doctors say the survival rate is a coin toss. Ford has been given just a 50 per cent chance of survival. His doctors are now trying to shrink the five-inch tumor with chemotherapy and then reassess. The cancer has not spread to his organs, they said. 'The kids, it's ripping my heart out,' said Ford earlier this month about his two children, who are seven and nine, adding that they know exactly what's happening with their father's diagnosis. 'Some nights I just cry myself to sleep, but what can you do, there's only that many tears that can be shed.' But he added that he 'sees the glass as half full' and that he is taking it 'day to day'. Ford, 45, has been engulfed in controversy since the Toronto Star and the U.S. website Gawker last year reported the existence of a video apparently showing the mayor inhaling from a crack pipe. By his side: Rob Ford is pictured with his brother Doug (right), who is a city councilor, last November . Together: Doug, pictured left with the mayor after he returned to work following rehab in July, has an uphill battle to take the mayorship as his campaigning started late. Rob Ford has spoken out in support of him . After months of denials, he finally admitted to using crack but adamantly refused to resign, even after Toronto's City Council stripped him of most of his powers. A stream of revelations of erratic behavior, public drunkenness - and a report of another crack video - finally prompted him to enter rehab earlier this year. Ford took a two-month break from officein the summer to undergo treatment for substance abuse at a rehabilitation center and returned to work in July. He was hospitalized in September after suffering from abdominal pain for three months.","The 45-year-old Toronto mayor was diagnosed with a rare cancer in September and is between chemotherapy treatments .

"A mother-of-one launched a frenzied attack on a nurse after spotting her 'kissing' her boyfriend in the back of his van after a night on the town. Faye Burke, from Manchester, punched the 48-year-old victim seven times, leaving her with blood trickling down her face. The 25-year-old is said to have shouted 'I can't believe you're in there with that' before attacking the woman and screaming 'I'm going to kill you, you b****'. Boom: Faye Burke punched the 48-year-old nurse seven times, leaving with blood trickling down her face . The 25-year-old is said to have shouted 'I can't believe you're in there with that' before clobbering the woman and screaming 'I'm going to kill you, you b****' The nurse had been out in a bar in the Deansgate area of the city with Burke's then-boyfriend and another man, Manchester Crown Court heard. After a few drinks, the victim and the boyfriend decided to go into his van, parked outside a bar in the Deansgate area of the city, for a 'kiss'. But Burke, who was also on a night out in the area, recognised her boyfriend's van and discovered the pair inside. Burke's boyfriend tried to restrain her but she wriggled free and flung open the van doors, repeatedly punching the 48-year-old until she was knocked unconscious. When police arrived at the scene the victim was lying motionless on the floor of the van, as Burke continued to punch her in the head. Prosecutor David Lees said the victim was left 'extremely shocked' by the attack. In a statement she said: 'I keep reliving the incident in my head and having flashbacks. I thought I was going to die.' Burke recognised her boyfriend's van in Deansgate, Manchester, and discovered the pair inside . Burke admitted causing actual bodily harm, possessing cocaine and breaching a suspended sentence following the attack in the early hours of August 16. But she avoided a jail term after Recorder Brian Cummings QC was told of the effect prison would have on her six-year-old daughter. Burke was handed a four-month sentence, suspended for two years, with a curfew and a requirement to attend a probation service women's programme. Recorder Cummings described the attack as 'disgraceful' but said that it 'represented a shortlived if serious loss of control at a time of high emotion'. At the time of the offence, Burke was subject to a suspended sentence for conspiring to smuggle two mobile phones to a prisoner in 2012.","Faye Burke found her boyfriend in his van with a 48-year-old nurse .

The emotional footage shows Mr Martinez, now 60, running out of his house and into the arms of his teary-eyed long-lost friend, while telling him: 'My God buddy. I love you. I love you.' Mr Mueller, 61, and Mr Martinez met on the Navy's U.S.S. White Plains AFS-4 supply ship and quickly became friends. They were so close they were nicknamed 'M&M'. During their service, the pair shared a cabin, traveled to a number of countries - including Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok and Japan - and worked side by side on the ship. Together again: After the war ended in 1975, the friends spent 40 years trying to find each other, including searching phone books and sending letters. Above, they look through old photos following their reunion . Letter: It was only when Mr Martinez's sister-in-law, Jennifer Williamson, found Mr Mueller's details online and Mr Martinez subsequently sent his former shipmate a letter (pictured) that the two were reunited . After the war ended in 1975, they returned home to their old lives, but were determined to stay in touch, Fox 29 News reported. However, when Mr Mueller reached out to Mr Martinez from a pay phone at a Denver gas station, he realised he had the wrong person. For the next four decades, the war veterans tried desperately to find each other, including searching phone books and sending letters to various addresses, but neither of them had any success. We tried 'every day for the last 40-some years,' Mr Mueller, who even named his first child 'Joe' after his old friend, told AOL.com. Best friends: During their time in the U.S. Navy, the duo were nicknamed 'M&M' based on their surnames . Ship: Mr Mueller and Mr Martinez met while serving on the U.S.S. White Plains AFS-4 supply ship (pictured) It was only when Mr Martinez's sister-in-law, Jennifer Williamson, heard about her relative's quest and scoured the internet for Mr Mueller's details that the two were reunited. After she informed Mr Martinez of her success, the shocked veteran sent Mr Mueller a letter telling him it was his 'best friend' and former shipmate, and asking him to give him a call. A few days later, a call came in from Minnesota. 'I heard his voice, ""Is this Joe Martinez?"" Then I screamed, ""Rick!"" I knew so quick (it was Rick),' said Mr Martinez. The pair then talked for more than two hours, a lot of which was spent crying in sheer joy at having found each other. 'You could just feel the love over the airwaves,' said Mr Mueller. Delighted: Speaking of the moment he received a call from his old best friend, Mr Martinez (pictured) said: 'heard his voice, ""Is this Joe Martinez?"" Then I screamed, ""Rick!"" I knew so quick (it was Rick)' Thankful: The pair then talked for more than two hours, a lot of which was spent crying in sheer joy at having found each other. 'You could just feel the love over the airwaves,' said Mr Mueller (pictured) They then arranged to meet at Mr Martinez's house in Northglenn, Colorado - both slightly grayer and less fit, but still sharing a special bond - before engaging in the reunion earlier this month. Speaking on the day of the reunion, Mr Martinez said: 'I haven't been this happy since I remember when.' Mr Mueller added: 'I'm going to cry about this day for the rest of my life.' The pair have now vowed to stay in touch. And Mr Martinez and his family are even planning a holiday to Mr Mueller and his wife Marla's home in Le Sueur, Minnesota, next year.

"Sean Keen was jailed for 18 years after being found guilty of a string of sexual offences . A former Hare Krishna worshipper who spent a decade in a temple learning to be celibate has been jailed for a string of sexual offences on women and children. Sean Keen spend ten years in the temple in Canterbury, Kent, following the strict religion which forbids sex, unless for procreating, and alcohol. But after leaving, the 50-year-old embarked on a campaign of drunken sexual abuse which saw him rape a woman on several occasions and give a child a love bite. He was jailed at Canterbury Crown Court for 18 years by a judge who described him as a sex obsessed 'tyrant'. The court heard how Keen became a member of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and practised at the temple for ten years before the attacks. Despite vowing to remain celibate and refrain from drinking, he took up a five-can-a-day lager habit and violently raped a woman on several occasions. He also forced a dog to perform a sex act on him, and sexually abused children. Keen was convicted of three counts of sexual assault and four cruelty charges. During his trial in August, the court heard how one victim said Keen had treated her like a prostitute. Prosecuting Christopher May said: 'He was really angry and he had her by the throat. 'She kept saying ""No"". 'She struggled with him and they ended up on the floor. He really scared her and said he could snap her neck like a twig.' Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) heard the man repeatedly raped a woman and abused children despite having vowed to remain celibate after leaving the Hare Krishna temple . One of his victims claimed he had used her 'like his toy' and  'as if she were a prostitute for his pleasure'. The court heard that two of the people who were assaulted by the man had considered suicide after being forced to endure his 'mental torture'. Hare Krishna is a religious movement developed in the 1960s based on a set of Hindu principles. Its followers worship Vishnu, the Hindu deity and supreme god of Vaishnavism. Hare Krishna principles fall into four categories; cleanliness, mercy, austerity and truthfulness. Daily washing and refraining from illicit sex unless for having children are considered ways to stay clean, while not eating meat or eggs are considered acts of mercy towards animals. Austerity encourages followers not to indulge greed or addiction, so alcohol, cigarettes and hard and soft drugs are forbidden. Gambling and lying betrays Hare Krishna's definition of truthfulness so are also prohibited among followers. Judge Adele Williams said: 'You have shown no real remorse or insight into what you put your victims through or the anguish and long-term psychological damage you have made them suffer. 'You were obsessed with sex and became a tyrant.' Following Keen's conviction a spokesperson for the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) said: 'The individual in question has no current affiliation, position or association with the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). He has not had any contact with the organisation for over ten years. 'His actions are abhorrent and criminal and we do not condone them in any way. They are not only a gross violation of our morals, values and code of conduct, but are morally reprehensible for any member of society. 'We have every confidence in the judicial system and believe his sentence should reflect the gravity of his crimes. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.'","Sean Keen worshipped the strict faith for ten years in Canterbury, Kent .

"The pavement of a busy London street suddenly 'exploded' into flames last night, shocking residents who had to be led to safety. A 'huge' fireball burst through a manhole cover on Holloway Road, Islington, north London, after electrical wires became caught in the hole. Police cordoned off the road while firefighters evacuated homes, helping five people to escape from the smoke. Scroll down for video . A manhole cover 'exploded' on Holloway Road, Islington, north London, last night after electrical wires got caught in a manhole cover, which then burst into flames . One person was treated for smoke inhalation after the blast, which caused chaos as emergency services cordoned off the area . One woman was treated for smoke inhalation after the blast which knocked out power in the area. Witnesses spoke of their fear and confusion after smoke and flames started rising from the road at around 10pm. Jessica Farley said: 'Pavement just exploded outside my flat on Holloway road. Smoke everywhere and a complete power cut. Loads of fire engines and road blocked.' Kay Lockett tweeted: 'The pavement just exploded outside my flat. No power on Holloway Road. Sat in the dark.' Another shocked witness, using the name @supreme-nelle on Twitter, said: 'Powercut on my road & some of holloway road because some electrically wires went on fire... The fire was huge! There's no electricity.' Another Twitter user, @MCFCJon, said he saw the 'fire brigade forcing their way into properties'. The fire happened just outside the Green Jade Chinese restaurant. A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: 'We were called to a fire in a manhole cover in the pavement, at 22:01 in Holloway Road, Islington. 'Electrical supply was cut off. Five persons were led to safety by the brigade and one one adult female suffered from smoke inhalation and was treated on the scene by London Ambulance Service (LAS). 'All persons were accounted for. Police, LAS, and electrical engineers attended.' The resulting power cut left more 115 houses out of power, with that number increasing to more than 200 as engineers tried to fix the problem. The latest exploding manhole cover comes just months after 50 homes, also in Islington, had to be evacuated when an electrical fire burst out into a busy shopping area. The explosion happened outside Green Jade Chinese restaurant at around 10pm yesterday . Lucky: Miraculously nobody was killed when a pavement explosion in Piccadilly, central London, set fire to a lorry in July . A shop front in Pimlico, central London, was engulfed in flames after an explosion shattered the pavement . Then, in July, a lorry was engulfed in flames by a manhole explosion in Piccadilly, while only last month, flames erupted from a manhole cover by commuters on Old Brompton Road, South Kensington. Colin Wingate was severely injured and confined to a wheelchair for three months after a manhole cover exploded in Harrow, north-west London, in August 2011. He said: 'There was a huge - and when I say huge I mean enormous - explosion. Huge to the point that the iron manhole cover left the ground, I left the ground - and it was Bedlam.' He added: 'They are not doing enough to ensure that these accidents, incidents, call them what you like, don't happen anymore. Because sooner or later, at the rate these explosions are continuing, someone is going to lose their life.' Figures to September show that, so far this year, there have been 124 serious manhole fires involving faulty electric cables and junction boxes in Britain, compared to 34 in 2010. The overwhelming majority - 113 - have occurred in the South East of England, but serious incidents have been recorded over the past few years in Birmingham, Nottingham, Liverpool and, just last month, Aberdeen. Shocking: An enormous cloud of smoke rises into the air as a manhole fire rages outside a home in Hackbridge, Surrey . More than 100 serious manhole cover fires were reported this year. These pictures show a manhole fire in Peterborough in 2011 . Blast: A fire engine was called out after an explosion tore though the pavement in Islington, north London . The culprit appears to be the age of the country’s network of underground electricity distribution cables, combined with - or so the half-dozen electricity distribution companies claim - the vagaries of the British weather. Two very wet winters, it seems, have resulted in water seeping into link (junction) boxes, with delayed but serious consequences. Earlier this year, the Health and Safety Executive warned UK Power Networks (UKPN), which distributes electricity to London and the South East, to improve its safety record. Exploding pavements may be a nationwide problem but the risk is greatest by far in London. Sixty-four of the 113 serious incidents in the UKPN area so far this year have occurred in the capital, an average of almost two a week. A UKPN spokesman said: 'At 10.37pm last night, UKPN was alerted about an incident on some of our equipment in Holloway Road, London. The incident initially interrupted electricity supplies to 115 customers in the area. 'Our engineers attended to help the emergency services in making the area safe and carry out work to reconnect power supplies as quickly as possible. 'They had to isolate supplies to some further customers before reconnecting power in stages by 4.40am. The cause of the incident is being investigated. The safety of the public and our staff is UKPN’s top priority.'","Pavement 'explodes' into flames on a busy London street last night .

"The Medical Innovation Bill was launched by Lord Saatchi after his wife Josephine Hart (both pictured in 2011) died from ovarian cancer . A new law allowing dying patients to be treated with untested medicines has moved a step closer after the Government backed the plan. The Medical Innovation Bill aims to give legal protection to doctors who try out different procedures or treatments when they have exhausted other options. The Bill was launched by Conservative peer Lord Saatchi after his wife Josephine Hart died from ovarian cancer. Now Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has thrown his department's weight behind a backbench bill which will be debated in Parliament this week. A change in the law would allow doctors to try other treatments deemed reasonable, providing they are approved by a panel of medical specialists and either the patient or their representative. The idea is that it would help overcome the problem of doctors only being covered legally to offer standard treatments – even in cases where it is clear that standard procedures will lead to poor life quality and the death of the patient. Currently, if a doctor deviates from standard treatments, they could face the threat of legal action. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Dr Max Pemberton, a British  doctor, journalist and author, said: 'Worryingly, while doctors know that evidence-based medicine is not always the best choice for treating their patients, they have, in recent years, become increasingly scared of deviating from the standard treatments available to them, even if these don’t appear to be working. Scroll down for video . 'It’s a tragic indictment of modern medicine that too often innovation is jettisoned in favour of the status quo – not because it’s in the patient’s best interest, but because of the fear of being sued.' The legislation will have its detailed committee stage debate on Friday and the Department of Health said Lord Saatchi had tabled amendments adding extra safeguards to the Bill. The peer told the Telegraph: 'In dealing with the deadly Ebola outbreak,  the World Health Organisation has  decided that departure from standard  evidence-based treatment is fully justified  and essential. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) is backing a bill that would allow dying patients to be treated with untested medicines. The Medical Innovation Bill aims to give legal protection to doctors who try out different procedures or treatments when they have exhausted other options . The Medical Innovation Bill is designed to allow dying patients to be treated with untested medicines in a bid to save their lives when tried-and-tested drugs have failed. It also aims to give legal protection to doctors who try out different procedures or treatments when they have exhausted other options. The Bill was launched by Conservative peer Lord Saatchi two years ago after his wife Josephine Hart died from ovarian cancer. Now Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has thrown his department's weight behind the Bill, which will be debated in parliament next week. It has been supported by experts such as Sir Michael Rawlins, President of the Royal Society of Medicine, who said: 'The Saatchi Bill will allow responsible innovation'. Professor Ahmed Ashour Ahmed, Professor of Gynaecological Oncology at the University of Oxford, believes the bill will deter irresponsible experimentation, while encouraging innovation in the care of cancer patients. The General Medical Council and Cancer Research UK had concerns about the original version of the Bill, but after amendments were added, they are largely positive, The Telegraph reported. But Michael Baum, Professor Emeritus of Surgery at University College London, said : 'Changing the law with this bill is not going to accelerate innovation in cancer therapy, but might, as a result of unintended consequences, endanger our patients by uncontrolled experimentation.' 'It has set ethical guidelines for the use  of new therapies and interventions - they  are identical to the provisions of the  Medical Innovation Bill.' When the Bill had its second reading in June, Lord Saatchi told peers: 'All cancer deaths are wasted lives. 'Scientific knowledge has not advance by one centimetre as a result of all these deaths, because the current law requires the deceased receive only the standard procedure - the endless repetition of a failed experiment. 'The current law is a barrier to progress in curing cancer.' It is understood the Department of Health is minded to support the Bill, which would have to complete its passage through the Lords and then go through all its Commons stages before becoming law. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'Innovation is at the heart of modernising the NHS and is essential for improving treatments and finding new cures and work on the Medical Innovation Bill is ongoing. 'We are pleased that Lord Saatchi has tabled amendments to the Bill to help ensure patient and staff safety.' The General Medical Council (GMC) and Cancer Research UK both originally expressed concerns about the Bill but now broadly support the change in the law, providing safeguards are put in place. Professor Sir Peter Rubin, Chair of the GMC, told MailOnline: ‘Medicine is a risky business. There are many people alive today because of the willingness of doctors to innovate, deal with uncertainty and take reasonable risks which are understood, shared with, and consented to, by the patient in accordance with good medical practice. ‘While we welcome the amendments to the Bill in Lord Saatchi’s name we look forward to seeing the final version'. Sarah Woolnough, the charity's Director of Policy and Information, said: 'We know that more could be done to promote innovation in cancer treatment, especially for patients with life-threatening conditions where there are few treatment options, and the Medical Innovation Bill aims to support clinicians to act innovatively where they have exhausted other options. 'The latest set of amendments laid on the Medical Innovation Bill are an improvement, requiring a doctor to seek advice from an appropriately qualified colleague before departing from standard treatment. As the Bill now passes through Parliament, we must ensure it contains appropriate safeguards to protect patients. 'We will monitor the Bill’s progress closely and hope we will see a greater focus on innovation thanks to this Bill.'","Medical Innovation Bill was launched by Conservative peer Lord Saatchi .

"Passengers screamed in horror, held onto strangers’ hands and prayed out loud after an Air France flight was rocked by severe turbulence in the skies over England. Four cabin crew members were injured when the New York-bound plane suddenly lost altitude less than an hour into its flight from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. Aarti Virani, one of 484 passengers on board, said the turbulence struck without warning as flight attendants were serving beverages and it lasted about a minute. An Air France plane was met by firefighters at Charles de Gaulle Airport after it was rocked by turbulence . Passenger Bogdan Epure snapped this photo as the plane returned to Paris . This image from FlightRadar24 shows the path of an Air France flight that was forced to return to Paris . Even though she said it was brief, she described it as a terrifying ordeal that drove some fearful passengers to pray for their safety before the pilot announced that the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet was returning to Paris. Mrs Virani, from Jersey City, New Jersey, said: ‘I’ve been flying my whole life so I’m used to turbulence here and there but it was unlike anything I have experienced. ‘We felt weightless for a second and then it felt very long and it felt like we were being tossed.’ The 30-year-old added: ‘People were praying loudly. There was a gentleman next to me who was reciting Muslim prayers loudly, there was screaming – it was pretty rough. ‘There was one baby that was crying really loudly, which added to the sense of panic.’ When flight AF006 suddenly dropped in altitude Mrs Virani and a young woman seated next to her grabbed each other’s hands and held on until the turbulence ended. ‘We just kind of instinctively reached for each other’s hands. It just seemed like the thing to do.’ Paramedics and firefighters greeted the plane when it touched down at Charles de Gaulle Airport . This photo of the plane's flight path was taken by passenger Bogdan Epure on board the Airbus A380 . Her 37-year-old husband, Raj, who was seated ten rows behind her due to a booking glitch, saw pillows and other objects go flying. She said: ‘I imagine food would have been all over the place had we had trays of food on our tables. The drop felt pretty significant.’ Mrs Virani, who survived a 7.3-magnitude earthquake that killed thousands of people in Japan in 1995, said she had a flashback to that experience because she was so petrified and her adrenaline kicked in. She said there was no indication that passengers and crew were in for a bumpy ride. She said: ‘When the strongest gusts hit us they came without warning because when we were ascending the pilot made a short announcement saying it was going to be a smooth ride and there were a few clouds, but when we get above them that it should be a smooth ride to New York. Four Air France cabin crew members were injured when an Airbus A380 hit severe turbulence . Air France says the crew members were injured as the plane entered the beginning of its cruise phase . ‘After the turbulence everybody calmed down a little bit and maybe 10 to 15 minutes later the captain made an announcement saying there were flight attendants who had been injured and we had to turn around so they could receive medical attention,’ She said there was a suggestion that the turbulence was caused by the ‘leftovers’ of a jet stream from a flight ahead of them. ‘That made us think, “How close are we to another flight?”’ But Air France spokeswoman Ulli Gendrot described it as ‘clear skies turbulence’. After the incident the captain chose to abort the eight-hour transatlantic journey and turn back to Paris so the injured workers could be assessed by paramedics. The Airbus A380 landed safely at Charles de Gaulle Airport after the captain decided to return to Paris . Air France also confirmed that none of its 484 passengers was injured . Data from flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com showed that the plane turned around as it flew in airspace near Leeds. The Air France employees were initially reported to have suffered concussion, but Ms Gendrot said their injuries were not as serious as initially feared. She said the cabin crew members ‘suffered various but uncomplicated bruises’ and all went home after they were given medical assistance at the aircraft’s parking stand at Charles de Gaulle, where the plane was met by firefighters and paramedics. None of the passengers was injured and they were rebooked on flights that departed later Tuesday or Wednesday. Mrs Virani was returning to the US, where she works as a freelance arts and culture writer, after a one-week holiday in Europe with her husband. They were put on a flight that arrived at New York’s JFK International Airport early Wednesday morning while others had to spend the night in Paris.","Four cabin crew members were injured when the plane lost altitude .

An Australian police launched an internal investigation into the incident, as the police officer involved had breached strict protocol by pretending to handcuff the celebrity. Allen posted the photograph of her fake arrest on Social Media during her Australian tour; taken after she landed at Gold Coast Airport in Queensland. Lily Allen and Australian Federal Police staged a fake arrest at Gold Coast Airport on Sunday. The Instagram photo was tweeted to her 4.7 million Twitter followers . A number of Federal Police officers were on hand to escort her from the airport. Breaking strict protocol, the officers agreed to Allen's request to be put in handcuffs as she knelt down - and an aide took a photograph and posted it on her Twitter account which has more than 4.7 million followers. The image has since been removed. In July, an AFP spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Allen was being escorted by the officers through the terminal when the photo was taken. 'At her request members involved placed open handcuffs for a photo opportunity,' the spokesman said. 'It appears the members involved were caught in the moment and standard protocol were breached. 'It is subject to internal processes.' At the time, Gold Coast City councillor Dawn Crichlow said the stunt was no laughing matter. 'I don't appreciate a photo of ... police playing around with their handcuffs,' she told Fairfax radio. 'It's bad that the Federal Police allowed this to happen and they should be hauled over the coals. 'Just a bit of fun would have been to give her the police cap and have a photo taken like that, that would have been fun.'","Former swimmer Michael Klim posted fake arrest on Instagram .

"The parents of ISIS hostage Abdul-Rahman Kassig  attended an Islamic service today to pray for their only son after militants named him as the next beheading victim. Ed and Paula Kassig requested the service at the Islamic Society of North America in Plainfield, Indiana on Friday afternoon at 2pm. The service was multi-faith and honored the humanitarian work that Mr Kassig, a 26-year-old Indiana native, carried out in Syria before he was captured by the extremists last October. Scroll down for video . American ISIS hostage Abdul-Rahman Kassig, 26, who was known as Peter Kassig before he converted to Islam. He is pictured doing humanitarian work before his capture by ISIS last October . Ed and Paula Kassig listen to a speaker during a prayer vigil for their son Abdul-Rahman Kassig on the campus of Butler University in Indianapolis on Wednesday. They attended another service today . Mr Kassig was named by ISIS as their next victim  following the beheading of British hostage Alan Henning in a video, posted online last Friday. Edgar Hopida, from the Islamic Society, told WTHR that they were fearful for Mr Kassig but maintained a sense of hope. Mr Hopida said: 'He's one of our own. He's a Hoosier. He's also our brother in Islam, and so we want to support the family. We want to support Peter by having a short program to honor his work.' Mrs Kassig will read messages from friends at the service. The Islam society welcomed everyone and asked guests to dress conservatively. The group said they would appreciate if woman wore headscarves but it was not required. The 26-year-old was shown in an ISIS video last Friday depicting the beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning. Kassig was taken captive last October as he worked for the aid organization he founded in Syria. In the past week, Mr Kassig's parents have appealed directly to the terror group leader on Twitter, begging him to spare their only son's life. They reached out to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi over social media. On Wednesday, the hostage's family posted a message to Twitter pleading to the ISIS leader directly. On Wednesday, the hostage's mother, Paula Kassig, posted a message to Twitter pleading directly to the ISIS leader for her son's life . In a video released last Friday, Islamic State militants threatened to kill 26-year-old American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig . The letter read: 'I am trying to get in touch with the Islamic State about my son's fate. I am an old woman, and Abdul-Rahman is my only child. 'My husband and I are on our own, with no help from the government. We would like to talk to you. How can we reach you?' In a video published to YouTube on October 4, the Kassigs sat on a couch and spoke about the 26-year-old's humanitarian work during a desperate plea for his life. 'We are so very proud of you and the work you have done to bring humanitarian aid to the Syrian people,' Mrs Kassig said in the video as she clutched a photo of her son to her chest. 'Please know that we are all praying for you and your safe return.' Abdul-Rahman Kassig, 26, was called Peter before converting to Islam. His name, Abdul-Rahman, means 'servant of the most merciful'. He was captured by ISIS militants on October 1, 2013 while doing humanitarian work in eastern Syria.","Ed and Paula Kassig requested the service at the Islamic Society of North America in Plainfield, Indiana on Friday afternoon .

"This coat is £115 from Freemans but just £89 from Kaleidoscope . Trudging around the shops in winter can be miserable, so the popularity of catalogue and online shopping is no great surprise. However, if you compare the prices of some of the glossy brochures that thud through your letterbox, you could be in for a shock. A recent Freemans catalogue featured a pretty pink coat for £115 and a lace-trimmed cardigan for £65. But the Kaleidoscope catalogue had the same items at vastly reduced prices — £89 for the coat and £49 for the cardigan. The discrepancies do not stop there. A blue and black organza peplum dress that is £89 at Kaleidoscope will cost you £115 through Freemans, while patent leather Clarks shoes are £45 and £59 respectively in these catalogues — though they’re only £39.99 on the Clarks website. What makes these discrepancies even more astonishing is the fact that Freemans and Kaleidosope have the same parent company, Freemans Grattan Holdings. Jan Spurling, 67, from Wanstead, East London, has shopped with both catalogues. When she spotted the price differences, she wrote to the Daily Mail. ‘I’d never noticed it before — it’s only because the catalogues arrived on the same day,’ she says. ‘I’ve been shopping with them for ten or 12 years, so I am a bit cross.’ Freemans Grattan Holdings group company secretary Andy Lord says: ‘We vary our prices and terms and conditions across our brands. ‘If one of our customers shops with one of our brands and would like to apply for an account with another because they prefer that particular offer, they are always very welcome. ‘Our prices are not based on where the customer lives. Our internet and catalogue prices are nationwide.’ But, for Jan, that doesn’t cut the mustard. ‘To charge extra on what they’re making in the other catalogue is unfair,’ she says. ‘Everyone’s money is tight these days. The last time I used the Kaleidoscope catalogue was when my daughter was going to a wedding and wanted a posh dress. The stylish Abney dress from French Connection, costs £85 on the brand’s website. It’s the same price at Very.co.uk, but if you buy the dress at K&Co or Littlewoods, it will cost you £108 . ‘The one she bought cost a lot of money, but now, I think that if I’d looked at another catalogue, it might have been cheaper. I find it really annoying.’ Other companies use similar pricing tactics online and in their catalogues. Take the stylish Abney dress from French Connection, which costs £85 on the brand’s website. It’s the same price at Very.co.uk, but if you buy the dress at K&Co or Littlewoods, it will cost you £108 — that’s a hike of £23. However, all four companies are owned by ShopDirect. ‘Very.co.uk and Littlewoods.com offer different propositions, and products are priced to reflect that difference,’ says a spokesperson for Shop Direct. A Joanna Hope sequin and lace maxi dress is £95 at Julipa.com and £99 at Marisota.co.uk . ‘The price that Littlewoods.com customers see on the website or in the catalogue is slightly higher because it includes delivery and a wider range of flexible payment options to help spread the cost of purchases — a simple offer customers tell us they value.’ N. Brown owns a range of catalogues, including Julipa.com, Fiftyplus.co.uk, Marisota.co.uk and J D Williams, which feature some of the same brands, such as Together and Joanna Hope. A Together parka coat costs £85 at Julipa and Marisota, but at Fiftyplus.co.uk and J D Williams, it is £75 up to a size 18, rising to £89 for a size 32. A Joanna Hope sequin and lace maxi dress is £95 at Julipa.com and £99 at Marisota.co.uk. These sort of price differences are standard practice, says retail expert Liz Steer, who has worked with Harvey Nichols and Arcadia, which owns many High Street stores such as Topshop, BHS and Miss Selfridge. ‘Most retailers set their pricing driven by their particular brand. So, as they’re separate brands, they may have similar products, but when they decide to launch an item and put it into their range, they would decide what price that should go in at for their particular market.’ What this means is that clothes are often priced at a premium, according to what the shops or catalogues think their customers will pay. A more upmarket catalogue may have higher prices than a cheap and cheerful one, without necessarily offering higher quality products. This ‘dynamic pricing’ is a tough challenge for online shoppers to navigate, since retailers vary prices according to anything from the time of year to location. Orbitz, an online travel firm in America, offers more expensive hotel deals to Apple computer users because they are statistically more likely to be willing to pay extra. And American department store Macy’s changes its prices daily, according to demand. British companies including B&Q have been experimenting with similar approaches. ‘Some things might have higher mark-ups than others, depending on what you believe it’s worth to the customer,’ says Liz. ‘You’re not going to have the same price for a swimsuit in Spain in September as in the UK — you’re going to think more creatively to cater for the market. ‘It’s supply and demand: if you can get more money out of it, or if you need to clear your stock and sell it cheaper.’","The same coat is £115 from Freemans but just £89 from Kaleidoscope .

"Millions of holidaymakers who endure long flight delays will now receive compensation following landmark court rulings yesterday. Even those who made their claims as long as six years ago could be entitled to money. The Supreme Court rulings were hailed as a major victory for holidaymakers who have long been fobbed off with excuses by airlines. Scroll down for video . Landmark Jet2 and Thomson's applications to appeal against two flight delay compensation cases have been rejected, paving the way for thousands of new claims . Thousands of claims against airlines over flight delays had been put on hold until the Supreme Court rulings . Two million passengers a year whose flights are delayed by technical faults could now be entitled to hundreds of pounds each after judges found such problems are the sole responsibility of the airline. The industry is now expected to have to pay out £3.89billion for historic claims. Lawyer David Bott, who represented the passengers, said: ‘This is a landmark day. ‘Airlines will be made to face up to their legal responsibility and pay out fair compensation to those who have suffered. 'We’d expect hundreds of thousands of people to now come forward and make a claim.’ Yesterday’s judgments follow a six-year battle between airlines and passengers. Judges rejected separate appeals from airlines Jet2.com and Thomson, which had been taken to court by angry holidaymakers. Mr Huzar and his family were delayed by 27 hours at Malaga Airport due to an aircraft wiring problem . Under European law, passengers are entitled to up to £470 in compensation if a flight arrives at their destination more than three hours late. The exception is if the delay is caused by a so-called ‘extraordinary circumstance’ such as bad weather, industrial action or a bird hitting a plane. Airlines have been accused of repeatedly exploiting this rule to wriggle out of paying legitimate claims. They have argued that delays caused by technical faults also count as extraordinary circumstances beyond their control. This frees them from any obligation to pay. Holidaymakers who had claims rejected on these grounds took the airlines to the small claims courts and then to the Court of Appeal. Ronald Huzar, 58, from Stockport, was refused compensation by Jet2.com following a 27-hour delay when travelling with his wife and granddaughter from Malaga to Manchester in 2011. DAWSON V THOMSON . James Dawson, 41, of Peterborough, can keep the £975 plus interest (a total of £1,488.73) that he was awarded from Thomson Airways after his flight with his wife from Gatwick to the Dominican Republic on Christmas Day 2006 was delayed six hours 26 minutes. Thomson appealed the order for payment made by Judge Michael Yelton at Cambridge County Court on the grounds that it was outside the two year limitation period for claims under the 1999 Montreal Convention. But Lord Justice Moore-Bick unanimously agreed that claims can be made up to six years after the event under European law, and that Mr Dawson was just inside that limit. Solicitors Bott & Co says decision affects more than 11m passengers. HUZAR V JET2 . Ronald Huzar, 58, of Stockport, won his battle with Jet2.com after his flight from Malaga to Manchester in 2011 was delayed for 27 hours. The airline claimed a technical fault was 'unforeseeable' and they shouldn't have to pay compensation. But the judges ruled the fault was not an 'extraordinary circumstance' and they must pay. After his victory Mr Huzar said: 'I am absolutely delighted with the decision. After everything I have been through to get to this point it's a fantastic day. 'I always hoped that we would get a positive outcome and it's nice to get to this milestone. The result in my favour should help passengers throughout the country who have experienced similar difficulties to me.' The delay was caused by a wiring defect. Stockport County Court and then the Court of Appeal both ruled in his favour. In July, Jet2.com appealed against this ruling – this time to the Supreme Court. While it waited for a verdict the airline refused to pay other passengers delayed in similar circumstances. Other airlines also put thousands of compensation claims on hold. Yesterday the Supreme Court threw out Jet2.com’s request to appeal. Mr Huzar received £940 compensation in total. He said: ‘I’m ecstatic that we’ve finally got there after three years. ‘I think it’s brilliant not only for me but for everyone out there claiming flight compensation. ‘Jet2.com has fought tooth and nail to take my case this far but I think they deserve to lose after everything they have put me through. ‘I’m delighted not just for myself but for everyone else they have treated in this way.’ A separate ruling by the Supreme Court means that passengers will now be able to claim for delays dating back six years. James Dawson, 41, took Thomson to Cambridge County Court after his compensation claim for a six-and-a-half-hour delay was rejected by the airline because it was more than two years old. Mr Dawson – who was stuck at Gatwick Airport before flying to the Dominican Republic in 2006 – won cases in the county court and the Court of Appeal. Yesterday the Supreme Court rejected Thomson’s request to appeal. Mr Dawson, from Peterborough, has now received £975 in compensation plus interest totalling £1,488.73. Experts predict these victories will open the floodgates for claims from passengers who suffer delays in the future. Andrew Haines, chief executive of watchdog the Civil Aviation Authority, said: ‘Where airlines have put claims on hold, the CAA expects airlines to revisit them and pay compensation for any eligible claims.’ A spokesman for Thomson said: ‘We are surprised and disappointed to note the decision of the Supreme Court as we believe our position is sound in law. 'We will now review this position based on the court’s decision.’ Jet2.com did not want to provide a comment.","Jet2 and Thomson lose appeals against passenger delay compensation .

"In February he brought us fast food fashion and it seems that in his second season at the helm of Moschino, Jeremy Scott hasn't run out of creative ideas. The creative head, who is famed for making kitsch cool, sent his models down the runway in Milan in Barbie doll inspired dresses to the sound of Aqua's iconic 90s hit, I'm A Barbie Girl. The show was opened by a doll dressed exactly the same as the plastic one gifted to audience members and each new model followed suit. In short; a collection that screams Rita Ora. I'm a Barbie girl! Jeremy Scott, in his second season as creative head for Moschino, put on a super fun, Barbie-inspired show in Milan last night . There was business woman Barbie, kitted out in an embellished pink suit, work out Barbie, in a sports luxe tracksuit (in pink, of course) and cowgirl Barbie in glitzy rodeo attire. Popular model Charlotte Free took on the role of roller-skating Barbie and skated along the catwalk in a bra, tracksuit bottoms, and sweatband, emblazoned with the doll's iconic logo. Take your pick: There was sporty Barbie, left, in a branded tracksuit carrying weights, as well as cowgirl Barbie, right, who rocked a rodeo style . One for Rita Ora? The loud and proud designs in vibrant hues of pink, yellow and turquoise wouldn't be out of place in Miss Ora's wardrobe . It's time to think pink: Speaking about his inspiration, Scott said he loved Barbie growing up, adding: 'It's hard not to; she's practically perfect' Elle Woods, is that you? With their blode wigs and head-to-toe pink outfits, Scott's models resembled Reese Witherspoon's character in Legally Blonde . Remember last season's sought-after McDonalds fries Iphone holder? In six months time Moschino's new bubblegum pink Disney-style hand mirror that doubles as a phone case will be every fashionista's phone case of choice. Accessories too were a throwback to the 90s, with bubble backpacks dominating and chunky gold necklaces and belts adorning model's limbs. Speaking to Style.com about the show, Scott explained: 'Like every girl and gay boy, I loved Barbie. 'It's hard not to; she's practically perfect. She's a good big sister, she's had every job in the world, worn every outfit. And it's just joyful. Her and I share the same things: We just want to bring joy to people.' If Scott has his way, we all really will be Barbie girls in a Barbie world. It wasn't all pink!

Best Art Experience in a Hotel - in partnership with Hotel Insider (Jury award) Benesse Art Site – Naoshima . Commenting on London’s selection as the Best City for Culture, Mayor of London Boris Johnson, said: 'London is home to some of the best museums and galleries in the world, with an unrivalled range of top-notch art, photography and installations that attract millions of visitors from around the globe. 'The visual arts are part of a fabulous mix of cultural attractions that includes world-class theatre, concerts and dance, which give London the leading-edge as the world’s greatest city for culture. 'Arts and culture are hugely important to our city's success and we look forward to welcoming tourists inspired to visit London following this latest accolade.' Cultural institutions in cities as far and wide as Paris, New York, Miami, Shanghai, Oslo, Berlin and Mexico City, were among those competing to win nine awards at the event, held at Jumeirah Carlton Tower, London. The winners of six of the awards were selected based on the cultural recommendations of leaders and innovators in the creative industries, such as Matthew Clark, co-founder of United Visual Artists, curator Jerome Sans, jewellery designer Anabela Chan and former Royal Academy Exhibitions director Kathleen Soriano, who have given their views for the Leading Culture Destinations online travel guide, which ranks the world’s best in arts and culture destinations. Three awards were chosen by a special jury consisting of key members of the creative and culture industries and representatives from Leading Culture Destinations. In their variety and breadth, the awards aim to reflect the changing landscape of cultural institutions, which has seen them become not only places to see art but also places to learn, socialize, shop and, sometimes, even sleep. Florian Wupperfeld, co-founder of Leading Culture Destinations, said: 'We’re thrilled to present the inaugural Leading Culture Destinations Awards celebrating the best visual arts institutions around the world. 'Culture is one of the key drivers for tourism, and a revolution in the sector has seen museums become not just places of cultural pilgrimage but social hubs, places to dine, to read and to explore the arts through the new digital technologies - and sometimes even to drop your children off for a sleep over, a change which we celebrate with our awards. 'Within culture, until now, most awards have been much more localised - and the only global ranking lists are based on footfall – making them entirely quantitative and not qualitative. 'We hope the Leading Culture Destinations Awards will become a more helpful representation of what the world’s best arts institutions have to offer, recognising the sector’s innovators and leaders, and help more cultural travellers to discover them.” The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, was named Leading Culture Destination for Architecture & Spatial Design .

"An 'aggressive' Oxford University bursar was sacked from a college run by a former BBC boss after a conspiracy to oust her, a tribunal heard today. Jean Wright, 60, claimed she was fired from her role after she pushed for a university archivist colleague to be dismissed over harassment allegations - a move she says turned other staff against her. College master Mark Damazer CBE, a former controller of BBC Radio 4, rubbished the 'spurious' allegation, saying it was 'untrue and without foundation.' Mrs Wright, from Kidlington, Oxfordshire, is suing St Peter's College for public interest disclosure, unfair dismissal and disability discrimination. Jean Wright, 60, (left) is suing Oxford University's St Peter's College for public interest disclosure, unfair dismissal and disability discrimination. College master Mark Damazer CBE (right) has rubbished her allegations . The home bursar said depression affected her work, but Mr Damazer said the college was not initially aware of her condition and, even if it had been, believed it did everything it could to help her. St Peter's College's alumni includes actor Hugh Dancy, Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and former FA executive David Davies. Mr Damazer, who was awarded his CBE for services to broadcasting, took up his role at the college in October 2010. Early in his time there, Mrs Wright - an employee for 17 years - told Mr Damazer she was angry with how the college handled a complaint she made the previous year about volunteer archivist Geoffrey Fouquet. Mr Fouquet had apologised following an investigation but Mrs Wright made renewed allegations of harassment and bullying in June 2012 and a new probe was launched. This was dismissed but Mr Damazer decided he wanted to replace Mr Fouquet by Christmas 2012. Mrs Wright appealed the probe's findings but when this was rejected she took time off from work. Around the same time there were concerns about an investigation Mrs Wright led into allegations about another member of staff, Roger Hall, which resulted in his dismissal. This decision was subsequently overturned, after which Mrs Wright met Mr Damazer. Mrs Wright was sacked from St Peter's College (pictured) after 12 gross misconduct allegations were made . 'She asked me if she might still be able to sack Roger because he was ""no good"" and he should have done more about his dyslexia,' Mr Damazer told the employment tribunal in Reading, Berkshire. In early 2013, upset employees began to make complaints about Mrs Wright, including that she was 'being very difficult and making their lives at work constantly unpleasant', Mr Damazer said. 'The nature of the complaints against the claimant were similar in that staff advised that she had been aggressive, hostile, threatening and abusive,' the former BBC controller said. Following an investigation, 12 gross misconduct allegations were made and Mrs Wright was sacked as a result in mid-2013. Mr Damazer said: 'I know that the claimant has suggested that the disciplinary process was somehow orchestrated by various people within the college as a result of her complaints about Mr Fouquet. I am not aware of any such connection. 'The claimant has sought to make spurious allegations about matters which do not pertain to her dismissal in order to cause damage to the college and to myself. These allegations are untrue and without foundation. 'The college has sought at all times to deal with the claimant's behaviour and the complaints about her in a fair and appropriate way but could not simply ignore so many staff in distress, some of whom wished to leave their long-standing posts because of her aggression, threats and hostile approach. Mrs Wright, from Kidlington, Oxfordshire, (pictured outside the tribunal hearing in Reading, Berkshire) claims she was sacked after she pushed for a fellow colleague to be dismissed over allegations of harassment . 'While I was not directly involved in the decision making process I believe that the claimant was shown on the evidence to have acted in a way which was not only reprehensible in itself but an abuse of power in respect of her subordinates. 'The college stands by its decisions in relation to the claimant and notes that in the claimant's absence, the college staff are much happier.' Mr Damazer added that he was not aware Mrs Wright had been suffering from a condition which made her disabled under the Equality Act 2010. She had 20 days off in October 2012 and had 12 counselling sessions before being signed off with depression in December 2012 and work-related stress in January 2013. 'The college was not aware of the claimant's disability at the relevant time,' Mr Damazer said. 'Having now had sight of the medical reports, it is difficult to see what else could have been done to accommodate the claimant.' Mrs Wright's role included managing finances and budgets, overseeing accommodation needs for more than 200 students, cleaning rooms and managing events. 'The fact that she was able to undertake these complex duties practically is not indicative of the disability she describes,' he added. The college head added that he knew Mrs Wright made negative comments about his appointment, claiming he was not concerned with staff welfare - something he said was untrue. He said: 'I have always sought to be both equitable in tone and keen to stress the importance of fairness to all.' Mr Damazer said he organised a Christmas party at his home but said Mrs Wright was not keen on the idea. 'A party was arranged and was a success although the claimant did not attend this function, subsequent Christmas staff parties or the annual summer parties that my wife and I introduced,' he said. Mr Damazer and Mrs Wright are due to give further evidence to the hearing tomorrow. The case continues.","Jean Wright claims she was fired from St Peter's College after conspiracy .

She's certainly a good advertisement! Halle Berry looks flawless in the new campaign for the lingerie line . According to the company's website, Mr Perrier was manufacturing corsetry and hosiery in a small factory in France when he started the label. After a visiting salesman introduced him to a new fabric, he created a girdle that was so delicate and light compared to the restrictive corsets of the time that his assistant exclaimed 'C’est un scandale!' upon seeing it. 'We've taken this brand and revamped it,' Ms Berry told the Associated Press. 'But we've kept all the qualities of the Parisian sort of style intact.' The sexy star has been a Revlon brand ambassador since 1996, but said she wanted to have a greater role in leading a company. Co-owner: Ms Berry's business partner is Erik Ryd (left), founder of the intimates company Hop Lun . 'I decided for my own evolution as a woman and an entrepreneur, it’s time for me to step out and really be part owner of something that I believed in and not just lend my name to a brand,' she said. Ms Berry now owns 50per cent of the brand, which is co-owned by her business partner Erik Ryd, founder of the intimates company Hop Lun. The mom-of-two, who stars in the upcoming thriller Kidnap, admits that it takes a lot of work to juggle an acting career with the demands of running a business. 'You have to really want to do it. It’s time-consuming. You have to work hard at it,' she said. 'Along with the career you already have, it’s another job, if you will, that you’re tackling.' Coming soon: Halle was later seen arriving at an office in New York after the launch .","The actress's first ten-piece collection, with prices ranging from $7 to $18, will hit stores October 27 .

"New York police are concerned drones could become tools for terrorists, and are investigating ways to stop potential attacks. Until now police haven't acknowledged drones as a potential weapon, but the NYPD has now said the technology has advanced enough that someone could use them to carry out an air assault using chemical weapons and firearms. Police want to develop technology which will allow them to take control of drones as well as scan the skies for them before major events. The NYPD says drones carrying explosives are the number one threat as they investigate ways to stop attacks . Deputy Chief Salvatore DiPace, left, was concerned about an incident last year where a drone was landed in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 'could have took the chancellor and her people out' A drone which was flown over a packed football stadium in Manchester, England, just over a week ago, resulting in the suspected pilot being arrested . They are consulting with the military and members of its counterterrorism, bomb squad, emergency services and aviation units are working on a plan to counter weaponized drones. The NYPD hasn't received any intelligence indicating there is an imminent threat, but has become increasingly concerned over the last year. Deputy Chief Salvatore DiPace told CBS News: 'We've looked at some people that have jury-rigged these drones to carry guns, to carry different types of explosives if they wanted to; there's just so many possibilities that we're very worried about.' Mr Dipace said police had also seen video showing how accurate an attack from a drone could be: 'We've seen some video where the drone was flying at different targets along the route and very accurately hitting the targets with the paintball. The NYPD now sees a drone carrying explosives as the number one threat. Mr DiPace's concerns follow an incident in Germany last year where a drone was able to land just in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel as she delivered a speech. The drone, circled, landed in front of Ms Merkel as she delivered a speech sin Germany sparking fears that the device could easily be used to commit a terrorist act . He said: 'If you really think about what could have happened there, the drone hit its target right on the mark and could have took the chancellor and her people out.' There has been a dramatic increase of incidents involving drones in New York City in the last year, with 40 recorded. In some cases unmanned aircraft systems or drones had flown into airspace being used by NYPD helicopters. In one incident this summer, a drone which was almost 800 feet off the ground, nearly collided with a police helicopter. NYPD Aviation Unit Member, Sergeant Antonio Hernandez said: 'We're flying in the dark; we have night-vision goggles on, we're trying to get a job done and then the next thing you know we see this drone come up to our altitude.'","Police have investigated criminals who have rigged guns to drones .

"Not satisfied with regularly being voted The World’s Sexiest Woman by readers of various men’s magazines, Kelly Brook is taking her looks to a new level with a range of beauty supplements developed by celebrity make-up artist Gary Cockerill. Kelly’s close friend Gary, whose clients also include Melinda Messenger, Martine McCutcheon and Melanie Sykes, has collaborated with NRG Fuel to develop the vitamin boosters, designed to promote beauty from within. Beauty Within consists of Green Caffeine, Raspberry Ketones, Colon Cleanser and Acai Berry vitamin pills. Kelly Brook has been exercising hard in Los Angeles, mixing cardio and weight-training in the gym . The lead product is a fruit punch flavour vitamin powder. Gary has sent boxes of the beauty drink, which contains vitamins to help the body produce collagen, to celebrity pals in the hope it will improve their hair, skin and nails. He says: ‘What we put into our bodies shows on the outside.’ Kelly, 34, who recently split from boyfriend David McIntosh, has been exercising hard in Los Angeles, mixing cardio and weight-training in the gym with hiking in Runyon Canyon. The 34-year-old recently broke up with her boyfriend and former Gladiator, David McIntosh . Clever way to take tablets . Help is at hand for those who forget to take their medication, sometimes with serious consequences. A new device, Clever Card, will help patients keep on top of their tablet-taking. Clever Card works by detecting when a blister pack is opened and sending a message to a cloud-based data system. The system will set off an alarm or a flashing light on a mobile phone-like device to remind the patient to take their next pill. The system, which is at trial stage, can also be monitored by pharmacists or carers, who can check on the patient if they see that a dose is missed. Wasted prescriptions cost the NHS £500 million every year, and 200,000 deaths occur annually in the EU because of missed doses. Casting new light on the classroom fidgets . They're the bane of many teachers’ lives, but now there may be a simple way to stop fidgeting schoolchildren – by changing a light bulb. The warmth and strength of lighting can have a major effect on fidgeting, according to a new research. Light is known to have effects on mood and behaviour, and a Hamburg University study looked at the effects of different types of light on school pupils’ behaviour. A big decline in fidgeting was noted when using a dark, warm white light with reduced brightness. The same light also improved behaviour, with fewer classroom assaults on other pupils. However, it is not known how this works. One theory is that it has an impact on mood and movement through the manipulation of the body clock, or it may be that dark, warm light evokes relaxation and a sense of reassurance. In a study of 1,736 participants, the use of acupuncture, carried out over more than four weeks in 893 patients, showed reduction in pain, improved mobility and better quality of life compared to no treatment or usual care . Acupuncture can significantly reduce the intensity of pain felt by osteoarthritis patients, according to new research. In a study of 1,736 participants, the use of acupuncture, carried out over more than four weeks in 893 patients, showed reduction in pain, improved mobility and better quality of life compared to no treatment or usual care. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition suffered by a third of those aged over 45. Gradual loss of joint cartilage results in pain and loss of mobility. The results of the study were published in the BMC Complementary And Alternative Medicine journal. Ellie and her pet gecko Eddie, right, are the stars of a new children’s book aimed at helping parents manage their youngsters’ dry and eczema-prone skin. Called The Dry-Ventures Of Ellie And Eddie, their story Bye Bye Dry Skin comes from dry-skin cream brand Aveeno and can be downloaded free from aveeno.co.uk. About one child in five in the UK suffers from dry or eczema-prone skin, which doesn’t produce as many fats and oils as normal skin, making it less able to retain water. The lack of moisture causes gaps to open up between skin cells – and as moisture is lost from the deeper layers, skin becomes dry and irritated. It can affect sleep and day-to-day life.","Celebrity make-up artist Gary Cockerill has developed vitamin boosters .

"Elle Macpherson made the seamless transition from supermodel to entrepreneur when she launched her eponymous intimates label 25 years ago. But after decades in the game, the 51-year-old's line will be 're-branded' as Heidi Klum Intimates. In a shock departure, The Body's former catwalk and Sports Illustrated rival, who is nine years her junior, will take over as the creative director and face of Bendon's flagship collection. Scroll down for video . Battle of The Bodies! Heidi Klum has taken over from Elle Macpherson as the face and creative director of intimates apparel brand Bendon . Bye, bye! It's been reported that the company expects to grow immediately by at least $25 million . Bendon CEO, Justin Davis-Rice said fresh designs and active publicity were important in growing the company: 'Elle has been a great partner to Bendon, however it’s time to take the brand to even greater heights, and Heidi is perfectly positioned to do just that.' According to Women's Wear Daily, Elle's three lines for Bendon - Macpherson Men, The Body and the intimates range - are estimated to be worth $150 million and turn over approximately $750 million annually. Davis-Rice told the publication he expects the brand to grow immediately by at least $25 million, with  Klum's new appointment helping increase retail orders by 25 per cent. Looking good! The German beauty says her new role with the Australian company is 'incredibly exciting' and has already shot the campaign .

"As new information continues to pour in about Wednesday's tragic shooting in Canada, gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's reasons for killing a solider and opening fire on Parliament still remain very much unclear. A 2011 court statement from Zehaf-Bibeau could shed some light on the attacker's past - and perhaps his motivations - as it was revealed today he had recently applied for a passport and planned to travel to Syria after undergoing a 'radicalization process'. Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo at a national war memorial in the capital Ottawa on Wednesday before racing through the parliament building where he was shot dead near where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was meeting with lawmakers. It has emerged that, three years ago, he begged prosecutors to put him in jail to help him beat his drug addiction. Scroll down for video . Troubled man: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau (above in a high school yearbook photo) fought an addiction to drugs over the past decade, one he thought he could overcome with jail time . No proof: While may said Zehaf-Bibeau had terrorist ties following his shooting spree in Ottawa Wednesday, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird currently says there is 'no evidence' of this . Zehaf-Bibeau walked into a Royal Mounted Canadian Police station on December 15, 2011, and asked to be put in jail for an armed robbery he committed ten years prior. 'I went to see the RCMP, I told them, 'just put me in so I could do my time for what I confessed,'' said Zehaf-Bibeau, in audio tapes obtained by CBC. 'They couldn't. So, I warned them, 'if you can't keep me in, I'm going to do something right now just to be put in.' So I went to do another robbery just so I could come to jail.' That robbery happened just hours later, when he went into a McDonald's with nothing but a sharpened stick and demanded all the money in the cash register. Police who arrested him on the scene said he seemed 'happy.' He then told the judge at his hearing, which happened after the incident at McDonald's but was for a likely parole violation stemming from a different robbery charge that occurred in Quebec and for which he had already served two years, 'I'm a crack addict and at the same time I'm a religious person, so I want to sacrifice freedom and good things for a year maybe, so when I come out, I'll appreciate the things of life more and be clean.' He added, 'The reason I am here is because I wanted to come in. The police said they couldn't keep me, so I went to do a crime to come to jail. So if you release me what's going to happen again? Probably the same loop and I'm going to be right back here again.' Vancouver home: Zehaf-Bibeau was staying at The Beacon (above), a homeless shelter, while living in Vancouver . Ottawa home: He was last staying at the Ottawa Mission (above), a shelter in Ottawa . Oddly enough, the prosecutor said Zehaf-Bibeau had already served his time and should not be allowed to go to prison, but the judge agreed to put him away, initially just over the holidays, and he stayed there, it appears, until his hearing in February 2012 involving the incident at McDonald's. At the time, Zehaf-Bibeau thanked the judge, and said, 'Perfect.' In the McDonald's case however, they could only charge Zehaf-Bibeau with uttering threats and, having already served 66 days in prison since December, he received just one additional day. The judge said to him, 'Good luck sir.' It comes as police revealed he had recently applied for a passport, planning to travel to Syria after undergoing a 'radicalization process.' Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was a Canadian who may also have held Libyan citizenship, said Bob Paulson, commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). He said the suspect had no apparent links to another Canadian who killed a soldier in Quebec earlier in the week. 'We need to investigate and understand his radicalization process. He is an interesting individual in that he had a very well-developed criminality,' Paulson said. 'There is no one path or one formula to radicalization.' He had recently applied for a passport and had arrived in Ottawa on Oct. 2 to try to speed that process, but checks by the RCMP did not turn up any evidence of national security-related criminality despite criminal records indicating infractions related to drugs, violence and other criminal activities, Paulson said. In mourning: The Canadian flag flew at half-mast today in memory of Wednesday's tragedy . Meanwhile, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird has said there is 'no evidence' linking Zehaf-Bibeau to a wider group, or network, of jihadists. What there is plenty of evidence of however, after multiple interviews with people who knew the 32-year-old shooter, is his struggle with drugs, and his desperate desire to kick his addictions. Abdel Kareem Abubakir, who became close with Muslim convert Zehaf-Bibeau as a result of their shared faith when they both lived at the same shelter, the Ottawa Mission, told the Globe and Mail, 'For two weeks he was communicative, but then when he collapsed into drugs, he became isolated.' He added, 'His intention was to get passport and get home. He had to stay away from drugs.' Zehaf-Bibeau, as it has been reported, was unable to get his passport to travel to the Middle East. Another man, who wished to remain anonymous and lived with Zehaf-Bibeau at The Beacon, a shelter in Vancouver, British Columbia, said that he met him in 2012 as he was in detox 'fighting off an addiction to crack cocaine and heroin.' He said Zehaf-Bibeau relied on 'constant prayer' to fight off addictions. Sneaking off: It was also revealed he was asked to leave his mosque, Masjid al Salaam (above), for sleeping there without permission, not extremist views . It has also been revealed that the young man was not asked to leave his mosque, Masjid al Salaam, in Barnaby, British Columbia, because he had any extremist views, but rather because he had begun sleeping there without permission. 'At some point, when he got in trouble with the law, and he didn't have a place to go to, he started sleeping at the mosque without any authorization,' said Aasim Rashid, a member of the British Columbia Muslim Association. 'When the mosque administration found out it, they asked him to leave immediately and asked him never to do that again.' The young man apparently stole the keys despite these instructions, and soon the locks were changed and he was told to never return. Rashid said there were no signs of 'radicalized behavior,' and had there been, members of the mosque would have noticed immediately as they 'don't tolerate that kind of extremist mindset.' What this reasoning does not explain however, if true, is why the young man would choose to commit such a horrific act if all he desired was to be put in jail.","Canadian gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau asked the RCMP to put him in jail in 2011 for an armed robbery he claimed to have committed 10 years prior .
When they refused he said if they did not, he was going to do something 'just to get put in,' and hours later tried to rob a McDonald's .
He then appeared in court a few days later, for a hearing on a previous robbery in Quebec, and begged the judge to put him away so he could 'overcome his crack addiction'
The prosecutor in the case said he should not go away, but he managed to spend 66 days in prison after pleading with the judge .

"A Kentucky mother who was reported missing when she failed to pick up her child from school on Friday was found three days later, locked alive in the trunk of her daughter's car. Aundrea Stone, 44, of Louisville was last seen at the Jay's Food Mart  in Okolona, but when she got back into her car she found another man inside who reportedly forced her to drive around Kentucky and Indiana for a few days. A Good Samaritan named Tiasha Chaplin rescued her Monday afternoon after hearing a thumping sound and a woman's voice coming from Stone's green Mazda, parked in a downtown Louisville lot. Found: Aundrea Stone was reported missing when she didn't show up to pick her daughter up from school on Friday. Three days later, she was found alive in the trunk of her daughter's car . Imprisoned: Stone allegedly doesn't remember much from her three days missing, but was able to tell police that a white man in his 30s forced her to drive around Kentucky and Indiana . 'We (were) walking passed a car and heard a 'thump, thump.' We thought it was a prank,' Chaplin told WLKY. Chaplin initially called 911 but when she passed by the car again and heard the noises getting louder, she decided to act. The woman broke a window of the car to pop the trunk and found a barely conscious Stone inside. Stone was rushed to the hospital where doctors treated her for dehydration, at least one broken arm and head trauma. However, they don't believe she was in the trunk for more than a few hours. Life saver: Good Samaritan Tiasha Chaplin (left) saved Stone's life when she heard thumping from Stone's green Mazda, and used a brick to break the windows and pop the trunk . Horrifying: Inside, Chaplin found Stone barely conscious. The woman was rushed to the hospital where doctors treated her for dehydration and at least one broken arm . So far, Stone hasn't been able to tell police much about her captor, describing him simply as an armed white man in his 30s who was wearing a hoodie and looked 'scraggly'. Local police say she remembers little from her three days missing. When Stone was taken to the hospital, she allegedly kept saying 'He hurt me, he hurt me' repeatedly, her pastor Carl Fletcher said. 'She's dealing with some slight trauma but she's alive and she's gonna recover from everything that's happened to her,' Fletcher added. Reeling: Stone's (right) pastor Carl Fletcher (left) says she is still dealing with the trauma of the incident but has been supported by her family visiting the hospital . Stone has been able to see her family while recovering, and may be released from University Hospital as early as Wednesday. Louisville police spokesman Dwight Mitchell also explained why police didn't open the trunk themselves when initially called to the scene. 'When the first officer came there, was there about 15 minutes. He checked the car thoroughly, ran the plates did not hear anything at that point and subsequently had cleared the scene,' Mitchell said in a press conference.","Aundrea Stone, 44, was reported missing on Friday when she failed to pick her daughter from class .

"Public hospitals in Brisbane and Hobart have the longest waiting lists for bowel cancer surgery in the country, a new report shows. And patients suffering bowel cancer wait longer  to receive surgery than those with breast or lung cancer, according to research by the National Health Performance Authority (NHPA) released on Thursday. Of 4362 surgeries for malignant bowel cancer across 89  large Australian public hospitals, 82 treated at least 90 per cent of their patients within 45 days. Patients suffering bowel cancer wait longer for surgery than those suffering breast and lung cancer. Patients at Princess Alexandra Hospital (above) in Brisbane  experienced the equal longest waits for bowel cancer surgery. Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane and the Royal Hobart Hospital had the longest waiting times for bowel cancer surgery, taking between 76 and 90 days to reach the 90 per cent completion rate. Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred and Royal Perth hospitals also had longer waits, taking 46 to 60 days to reach the same rate. The NHPA researched surgery waiting times at Australian public hospitals for three common cancers for which surgery is an important part of treatment: malignant bowel, breast and lung cancer. Royal Hobart Hospital (above) patients experienced the equal longest waits for bowel surgery, according to a new report. Using figures for 2012-13, the report lists the number of days between a patient's placement on a waiting list and the day they are admitted for surgery. Urgent cancer cases are expected to be completed within 30 days, while semi-urgent cases are meant to be completed within 45 days. The report found 96 per cent of breast cancer patients and 90 per cent of lung cancer patients received their surgery within 30 days. That figure dropped to 88 per cent for bowel cancer. Bowel Cancer Australia chief executive Julien Wiggins said bowel cancer patients had a five-year survival rate of 66 per cent, compared with 89 per cent for breast cancer patients. About 15,000 Australians are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year and about 4000 patients will die from the disease. Bowel cancer patients at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (above) in Sydney faced longer waits for surgery than in most other large Australian public hospitals. Mr Wiggins said it was good news that most bowel cancer patients received surgery within a month of being placed on a waiting list. 'Unfortunately, the data also shows that 216 bowel cancer patients did not receive timely surgery,' he said. 'They remained on the public hospital waiting lists for longer than 45 days.' Overall, 92 per cent of cancer patients were treated within 30 days and almost all - 97 per cent - had their operations within 45 days. Mr Wiggins said time on a hospital waiting list was only one component of cancer care. 'We need to find improvements at every stage of the cancer journey from earlier diagnosis, to timely surgery, more treatment options and better supportive care,' he said. Patients at Royal Perth Hospital waited longer for bowel cancer surgery than those at most other large Australian public hospitals. Source: National Health Performance Authority . AMA vice-president, Dr Stephen Parnis, was pleased cancer patients continued to be prioritised as requiring urgent elective surgery. 'But it's important to acknowledge that there are non-cancer elective cases that are also life threatening that also require prioritisation and resources,' Dr Parnis said. 'That's not in any way undermining the need for cancer support services but we have to remember that there's more than cancer that threatens the lives of Australians.'","Patients with bowel cancer wait longer for surgery than those with breast or lung cancer .

"Their diaries are stuffed with exclusive engagements – and their bank balances are almost as overflowing. But according to the glamorous cast of ITV’s latest reality series, life isn’t as sweet as it sounds. The six stars of Ladies of London claim their attractiveness actually makes it harder to succeed in a ‘man’s world’. Scroll down for video . Ladies of London: Caroline Stanbury, Marissa Hermer, Juliet Angus, Caprice Bourret, Annabelle Neilson and Noelle Reno . The series follows the high society exploits of British socialites Annabelle Neilson and Caroline Stanbury and American expats Caprice Bourret, Juliet Angus, Marissa Hermer and Noelle Reno. In the first episode, Miss Bourret – who classes herself as British – insists: ‘I find England still to be a man’s world. In this country, and especially if you’re good looking, it’s almost a detriment.’ The show was a hit when it was aired in the US earlier this year, and began on ITVBe last night. So just who are these ladies who lunch? 1. PRINCE ANDREW’S OLD FLAME . Caroline Stanbury, 38, was born into the Vestey family – worth an estimated £600million – and grew up hobnobbing with the royals. She owns a 12,000 sq ft home on the Wentworth Estate in Surrey, where Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have stayed. It boasts a swimming pool and six or seven bedrooms – ‘I really haven’t counted’. Upper-class glam: Caroline Stanbury, 38, is rumoured to have dated Prince Andrew and Hugh Grant . Miss Stanbury runs Gift Library, an elite gift service, and is married to investment banker Cem Habib, with whom she has a seven-year-old daughter and three-year-old twins. She is rumoured to have dated Prince Andrew, as well as Hugh Grant and footballer Ryan Giggs. How she sees it: ‘British women can be quite stuck-up, but American women, it’s kind of drummed into them to be these Stepford wives.’ On her fellow ladies: ‘Noelle and her hat, totally unnecessary [at polo]. She looks totally out of place.’ 2. THE QUEEN OF THE PARTY SCENE . Marissa Hermer, 32, is a director at Ignite Group, owned by her husband Matt. The group includes nightclub Boujis, a royal favourite. Mrs Hermer moved to London in 2008 and is known for lavish parties that feature in magazines such as Tatler. She has two young sons. How she sees it: ‘A lot of society girls were not interested in me… [until] they found out my husband was Matt Hermer.’ On her fellow ladies: ‘When you go out with Juliet you buy tickets to the Juliet show.’ 3. THE HOLLYWOOD SOCIALITE . Juliet Angus, 38, is a fashion PR consultant and aspiring TV personality. She has children aged four and two with husband Gregor, an advertising executive. The family, who employ a nanny and a make-up artist, moved to London from Hollywood three years ago, leaving behind friends including Leonardo DiCaprio and Lindsay Lohan. How she sees it: ‘The Brits are so serious, I just wanted to turn to them and say lighten up.’ On her fellow ladies: ‘Noelle’s idea of a future husband is one with lots of money in his pocket.’ Queen of lace: Caprice Bourret, 42, runs a lingerie empire and is believed to be worth £17million . 4. THE LINGERIE DESIGNER . Caprice Bourret, 42, is a model and businesswoman who owns lingerie company By Caprice. She moved to England from America in 1996 and now lives in London with her partner, multi-millionaire financier Ty Comfort, 45. She is believed to be worth £17million. Last year Caprice gave birth to a son – less than a month after having a baby by a surrogate mother. How she sees it: ‘No one goes to polo to watch polo. You go there to drink and socialise. Duh.’ On her fellow ladies: ‘Caroline is someone who will be so nice to you and then turn round and absolutely annihilate you.’ 5. THE ROCK ’N’ ROLL ARISTOCRAT . Model Annabelle Neilson, 45, was the long-term muse and close friend of the late Alexander McQueen. She is from an aristocratic family and is the ex-wife of financier Nat Rothschild, while her former boyfriends include Lord Edward Spencer Churchill, son of the Duke of Marlborough. Miss Neilson, who describes herself as ‘more rock and roll than posh’, counts Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Richard Branson among her friends, lives in Chelsea and is worth an estimated £13million. How she sees it: ‘The Americans are dressed like they’re going to have tea at Buckingham Palace, not the polo.’ On her fellow ladies: ‘The way I look at them is like three dogs. Juliet is an overexcited terrier, Noelle I see as a mutt you pick up from Battersea dogs home. ‘And Marissa is one of those pampered poodles with shaved stuff and little buns all over her. And she’s probably pink.’ McQueen's muse: Annabelle Neilson, 45, lives in Chelsea and is worth an estimated £13million . 6. THE WEALTHY FASHIONISTA . Noelle Reno, 30, is a former model and the co-founder of cashmere fashion brand Degrees of Freedom. She has also teamed up with fashion designer Zandra Rhodes for a clothing line called Z.

"Brendan Tevelin, 19, was brutally killed by a man who wanted revenge for American actions in the Mideast . It has been three months since  college student Brendan Tevlin was brutally murdered in New Jersey by an extremist determined to get revenge for American military action in the Middle East. And every day since, his parents Michael and Allison have passed by the corner of Walker Road and Northfield Avenue in West Orange — the spot where their 19-year-old son lost his life. 'We have to pass it every day,' Allison Tevlin told The Star-Ledger. 'We saw all the flowers and the crosses. It was unnerving.' The parents pass the tragic corner on their way to Seton Hall Preparatory School, where Brendan was a lacrosse star and maintained a perfect 4.0 GPA for four years. They're hoping to raise funds for an athletic complex to be built and named after Brendan. It is the same field that backs the woods where killer Ali Muhammad Brown, 29, hid for weeks after the murder — and the apartment complex where Brendan's body was eventually found. 'The field is in the center of everything,' dad Michael Tevlin told The Star-Ledger. 'So much bad happened right there, we want the field to be something good. 'To us, it’s a symbol that good is going to overcome evil. We took something terrible and made something good out of it.' Tragedy: The four Tevlin siblings — Brian, Michaela, Sean and Brendan — pose for a picture together. Their parents are working hard to honor Brendan's memory but to also move on for their remaining children's sake . Allison and Michael Tevlin (center) have organized a lacrosse festival in memory of their slain son Brendan . In an interview, the family tells The Star-Ledger they're focusing on honoring Brendan's life and coming to terms with his death. 'We still have three beautiful kids to raise,' Michael Tevlin told The Star-Ledger. 'We’re committed to Brendan’s memory but we still have to raise our other children and continue to instill in them the values we instilled in Brendan.' 'We’re trying to focus on our kids moving forward,” Allison added to the newspaper. 'We don't want them to be sad all the time.' Brendan had finished his freshman year at the University of Richmond, where he was planning to major in business, the school said. He graduated last year from Seton Hall Preparatory School. His room still looks the exact same way he left it: pictures with his lacrosse teammates,a photo from the day he went surfboarding on the Jersey Shore, and the gold tassel that shows his perfect score throughout high school, the Star-Ledger reported. There are also rocks from the Catholic retreats Brendan liked to attend, a reminder to his parents of their son's values and the importance of remaining strong for their family. 'To have someone so good taken so young from you could really rock the foundation of your faith — but if we let that happen, I know he would be so disappointed in us,' Allison told The Star-Ledger. 'Knowing how strong his faith was has given us some light and kept us grounded.' Brendan text messaged his mother to say he was going home just minutes before he was brutally killed . Brendan (back) with his younger brothers, Brian and Sean (from left), and sister Michaela . Brandon was an avid surfer and spent summers at the Jersey Shore with his family . A baby Brendan is caught in a candid moment with his little sister, Michaela . The New Jersey teenager was on his way home from a friend's house on June 25 when Brown and two accomplices approached his car at a West Orange intersection and allegedly shot the promising young student multiple times. Records show that Brown has confessed that he killed four men — including Brendan — because 'all these lives are taken every single day by America, by this government. So a life for a life.' Brown told investigators that he considered it his mission to kill Brendan as an act of 'vengeance,' records show. He describes the murder as a 'just kill' — and as part of his beliefs, if a 'man sees evil then he must take action against that evil.' Prosecutors say that Brown views US military intervention in the Middle East as that 'evil' against which he must act. Friends and family gather July 1 for Brendan's funeral in Livingston, New Jersey . Friends and family seek comfort in one another the day of Brendan's funeral . Friends and family gather to lay Brendan to rest . Brown faces four counts of aggravated murder in the first degree. He also faces three more murder charges for those he allegedly carried out across the summer in Seattle. Court documents seen by MailOnline show that the authorities were aware of Brown's fundamentalism more than a decade ago. He was arrested in 2004 as one of 14 men swooped on by federal agents following an investigation into a fraud ring suspected of defrauding banks across the country with the aim of funding terrorist groups in Somalia. Investigators could not prove that any money was moved overseas and Brown was charged along with three others, including his two half-brothers Karim Abdhullah Assalaam and Attawwaab Muhammad Fard, on multiple counts of conspiracy to commit bank fraud.","College student Brendan Tevlin, 19, was killed in June in New Jersey .

One-year-old Lilly Taylor was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital with life-threatening injuries after the accident at her home in Tipton, West Midlands last Thursday.

"'Rider safety is Uber’s #1 priority. We take reports like this seriously and are treating the matter with the utmost urgency and care.' This message from ride-sharing company Uber was seen when a D.C. driver was accused of sexually assaulting a sleeping passenger. It was also seen when an Atlanta driver allegedly pulled a gun on a valet. And when an Orlando driver reportedly touched a rider under her blouse. Victim: Roberto Chicas was attacked by Patrick Karahaj, 26, with a hammer after he and two friends argued over the route Karahaj was taking . Buzzfeed published a collection of statements the company released in the wake of eight incidents where drivers were accused of bad behavior or were involved in a crash. Groper: Ramy Botros, an Orlando Uber service provider, groped a female passenger and said she was dressed like she was 'asking for that' The announcements seem to follow a boilerplate formula, beginning with the representative talking about rider safety being Uber's priority, saying the company will respond with the 'utmost urgency and care.' In certain instances, the spokesperson will say they are suspending the driver or saying Uber is ready to aid investigators, as they did when an Alabama driver was found with weed and an open bottle of vodka in his vehicle. The statement quoted by NBC after a San Francisco UberX driver struck a passenger in the face with a hammer touched all the bases. 'Safety is Uber's #1 priority,' said Eva Behrend 'We take reports like this seriously and are treating the matter with the utmost urgency and care.' 'It is also our policy to immediately suspend a driver's account following any serious allegations, which we have done. We stand ready to assist authorities in any investigation,' Behrend added. According to a blog post on Uber's site, their policy is to conduct background checks on drivers that include looking at criminal history going back seven years. In the San Francisco hammer incident, the driver had a felony conviction from 2009 that the company missed for reasons that are not clear. Influenced: Police found marijuana and an open bottle of vodka in the vehicle of Uber driver Brandon Devante Oliver, 21, during a sting of ride-sharing and unlicensed cab vehicles in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where Uber has not yet been given a license to operate . Recently the company has faced criticism over rider safety. The Chronicle reported that the district attorneys of San Francisco and Los Angeles called some practices of Uber and two other ride-sharing companies a 'continuing threat to consumers.' Uber has not responded for comment as of yet.","Statements issued after eight incidents of alleged driver misconduct or safety issues repeat similar lines .

"A young man who went to his doctor seeking help for back pain says he was left feeling 'dirty and ashamed' by what happened next. The patient says Kelvin Thuc Minh Vo asked him a series of highly inappropriate personal questions, including whether he watched pornography, liked 'rough sex', had an interest in Asian men and if he was a 'giver' or 'taker'. The young man later said, it had left him 'scarred for life.' Horrified: The patient had complained about the actions of Kelvin Thuc Minh Vo, who worked in Campbelltown . He is one of two men whose complaints sparked the Health Care Complaint Commission to de-register Mr Vo for two years for professional misconduct. The commission said Mr Vo, 49, was running a solo practice at Campbelltown in south western Sydney when the young homosexual man, then around 18, went to him for help in 2009 and 2010. In another incident, when the man went to Mr Vo for back pain, it was alleged the GP placed his hand around the young man's penis and propositioned him. The young man, who can't be named for legal reasons, said he was left feeling 'dirty and ashamed he had done that to me'. More than a year later, in 2011, Mr Vo then instigated oral sex on another male patient, then aged 27. When the patient stopped him, the GP said: 'I'm prepared to give anything to you if you don't tell anyone.' On Monday, the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal upheld the complaints made by both men, finding the conduct of Mr Vo was so serious his registration needed to be cancelled to maintain public confidence in doctors. The tribunal said he, 'exploited a relationship of trust with his young and vulnerable patient'. 'We have found the practitioner to be untruthful, and can place no weight on his expressed remorse for his actions, other than his remorse for the consequences of those actions on him and his wife,' it said. It ordered his registration be cancelled for at least two years.","Doctor, Kelvin Thuc Minh Vo, has been de-registered for two years for professional misconduct .

"Once the highest paid actor on TV, Jan-Michael Vincent now lives out his days as a recovering alcoholic who almost died two years ago after an infection forced him to have his right leg amputated. In the mid-80s, Vincent earned $40,000 an episode as helicopter pilot Stringfellow Hawke in the top rated television series Airwolf. Yet even while filming the TV show, Vincent had admitted to issues with drugs and alcohol and admits that he still struggles with alcoholism. Scroll down for video . Once the highest paid actor on TV, Airwolf star Jan-Michael Vincent now lives out his days as a recovering alcoholic who almost died two years ago after an infection forced him to have his right leg amputated . When the show ended in 1986, acting roles dried up for Vincent as his demons got the better of him. He also suffered his fair share of bad luck including two serious car accidents. In the first incident in 1996, Vincent broke three vertebrae in his neck and sustained a permanent injury to his vocal cords that left him with a permanently raspy voice. The second crash happened in 2008, but worse was to follow in 2012 when he contracted a leg infection as a result of complications from peripheral artery disease. ‘An infection in my leg got steadily worse,’ he told The Enquirer. ‘I felt like I was beaten with a whip.’ Vincent’s third wife, Anna, admits that doctors told her he might not survive the infection and in the end they were left with no option but to amputate the lower half of his right leg. Vincent, who nowadays walks with a prosthetic limb, earned rave reviews for his role in 1978 cult surfing movie Big Wednesday . Pumped full of powerful pain medication, including propofol, Vincent bravely battled to stay alive. After a month in a recovery ward, he developed another infection that forced doctors to remove even more of his right leg. Now the ex-heartthrob walks with a prosthetic limb and is sometimes forced to use a wheelchair. The actor also admits that he still struggles with alcoholism and won’t discuss how long he has been sober. As well as struggles with numerous health issues, Vincent is also fighting to keep a roof over his head and he owes $70,000 in back taxes. ‘I’m praying for a solution,’ his wife Anna told The Enquirer. After Airwolf the acting work dried up for Vincent and nowadays he lives near Vicksburg, Mississippi, with his third wife Anna . The couple, who live near Vicksburg, Mississippi, first meet during the actor’s Airwolf days, although they didn't marry until after they reconnected in 2000. The troubled actor has been married twice before, first to Bonnie Poorman, his ‘college classmate sweetheart’ in 1969. The pair had a daughter, Amber Vincent, who is now 41 and Vincent says one his two wishes would be to reconnect with his only child. His second wife, Joanne Robinson, left him and had a restraining order entered against him in 1994, alleging that he had abused her since their marriage in 1985. As a young actor, Vincent won rave reviews for his role in 1978 cult surfing movie Big Wednesday. Once an avid surfer, his other great wish is to get out on the waves once again - even if it is on a belly board now that he can no longer stand on a surf board.

With his fellow offenders, he duped the victims into meeting him at a property they thought was for sale when they attacked. Beating the men, they took a wallet, watch, bracelet, phone and keys from one man. Both hostages were told to phone their wives and arrange for bank transfers of £5,000 and £9,000. Dhamial, who was described by prosecutors as the 'leader' of the group was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court to four years in prison. Fateh Kashief Ahmed, 47, Shakoor Ahmed Butt, 35, Shazwan Ashraf, 31, Ghulam Ali, 33, and Abdul Zubair Qadus, 33, were each sentenced to 32 months, while Mohammed Khateer Ali, 31, was sentenced to 27 months. Mohammed Khateer Ali (left) was jailed for 27 months while Abdul Zubair Qadus was sentenced to 32 months . Shazwan Ashraf, 31, was also jailed for 32 months . Senior investigating officer Duncan Thorpe, from GMP, said: 'The victims were severely beaten and threatened for money that the offenders believed was owed to them from a previous fraud. 'A separate investigation is being conducted in relation to the fraudulent activities of the two victims, but unfortunately the offenders in this case decided to take matters into their own hands and inflict violence upon the victims. 'They kept the two victims prisoner for a couple of days and this was clearly a terrifying experience for both men, but today justice has been done.' Rob Hall, of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said: 'Tariq Dhamial was the leader in the false imprisonment of two men after a business deal went wrong. 'The two complainants were physically assaulted and threatened with demands for money being made directly to their families on mobile phones. 'The defendants initially denied all offences but eventually admitted falsely imprisoning the two men on the day of their trial. 'The message is clear that this behaviour will not be tolerated. 'Today, as these men begin prison sentences, they must face up to the consequences of their unacceptable actions.' All seven men were sentenced to different jail terms at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) for their crimes .","The gang of seven Asian men held two victims hostage in Manchester house .

"With just three bakers left in the running, things are hotting up ahead of the Great British Bake Off final tomorrow night. But while Richard, Luis and Nancy are biting their nails, supermarkets are already celebrating thanks to soaring sales of baking ingredients. According to Waitrose, sales of edible glitter and mini marshmallows have doubled since the series began, while last week's patisserie theme boosted baklava sales by 100 per cent. Popular: Richard Burr's winning ways in the kitchen have made him the favourite to triumph in tomorrow's final . Sales have even remained buoyant in the face of the controversies that have dogged this year's Bake Off, including accusations of smut and the infamous 'Alaskagate' incident. 'It’s always great to see a TV programme inspiring shoppers to don their aprons and get cooking, and this effect is no more apparent than with the Great British Bake Off,' said a spokesman for Waitrose. 'Now in its fifth series, the programme’s effect on sales shows no signs of abating with this year’s challenges prompting customers to create all manner of baked treats.' But it's not only the supermarkets who are seeing the benefits as a result of Great British Bake Off's popularity. Bookmakers too are doing a roaring trade as punters rush to place bets on their favourite finalist, with builder Richard Burr currently leading the field according to Ladbrokes. Popular: Sales of edible glitter, pink and white sugar stars and mini marshmallows have all soared . Tasty: According to Waitrose, sales of baklava have shot up by an impressive 100 per cent in a week . Delighted: Judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood were delighted with Burr's heart-shaped doughnuts . Last week saw Burr leave judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood delighted, as he presented a series of perfect teatime treats, including heart-shaped doughnuts and a Swedish tea ring. But not far behind him is Stockport's Luis Troyano with odds of 2/1, while the last finalist, Nancy Birtwhistle, is hot on their heels on 3/1. 'It will be the biggest upset since David beat Goliath if Richard isn't crowned as Bake Off winner,' said Ladbrokes' Jessica Bridge. 'He's had Paul and Mary eating out of his hands every week and we cannot see success for Luis or Nancy.' She added: 'All three of this year's finalists are loved by Bake Off fans which has no doubt helped ratings rocket, along with the smutty innuendos.' Despite the smut, Burr, the indisputable star of this series, has proved considerably less controversial than last year's favourite Ruby Tandoh, who set Twitter ablaze as the final approached. Viewer's choice: Richard Burr's smiley demeanour and baking brilliance have put him in pole position . In the running: Nancy Birtwhistle and Luis Troyano will have to beat Richard Burr to win the Bake Off title . Controversial: Although Frances Quinn (right) won last year's final, Ruby Tandoh (left) proved controversial . Although she lost the final, she has since gone on to create a recipe book of her own which has also proved controversial, thanks to pops at Berry and Hollywood. Nevertheless, supermarkets will be hoping Burr follows in Tandoh's footsteps - in publishing, if not controversies - and helping to keep Britain's passion for baking alive in the process. 'At the beginning of the series, we saw a rise in sales of cake decorations and toppings that appeal to the nation's upcoming baking stars with mini marshmallows up 110 per cent, glitter strands up 124 per cent, pink and white sugar stars up 95 per cent, fruity confetti up 79 per cent and glacé cherries up 17 per cent,' added the Waitrose spokesman. 'Shoppers also started to stock up their cupboards with essentials in preparation for the weeks ahead, with sales of spelt flour up 103 per cent, lemon juice up 14 per cent and sandwich tins up 21 per cent. 'As the weeks go by, the bakes get harder but this hasn’t stopped our customers giving the various challenges a go in their own home. 'For example, during Baked Alaska week, we  saw a 129 per cent rise in sales of our Seriously Madagascan Vanilla ice cream and a 29 per cent rise in vanilla extract sales. 'Whatever the age or experience, it seems the nation is still dough-eyed for all things Bake Off!'","Waitrose say sales of baking ingredients have soared thanks to GBBO .

"A grandfather who built a fake bomb and planted it outside a Jobcentre after his benefits were temporarily stopped has been jailed for two years. William Harkin crafted the device using an analogue clock, wires and tape, before placing it in a brown paper package outside the building in Middleton, Greater Manchester. Manchester Crown Court heard how the 54-year-old had originally intended to stage a rooftop protest and unfurl a banner over the building, but decided to make the fake bomb instead. William Harkin, 54 (left) left a fake bomb (right) outside the Jobcentre in Middleton, Greater Manchester, after his jobseekers' allowance was suspended for three months . Harkin, originally from Northern Ireland, carried out the hoax the day after the 18th anniversary of the IRA bombings in Manchester. It came after his jobseekers' allowance was suspended for three months, after he missed a number of college courses designed to help him get a job. After planting the fake bomb in June this year, the court heard how Harkin rang police from a nearby phone box pretending to be a concerned passer-by. Police raced to the scene and cordoned off the area for five hours. An electronic Explosive Ordnance Disposal robot established the bomb was a fake and disposed of it in a small controlled explosion. While at the scene, officers found Harkin loitering in the same phonebox from which he had made the emergency call. He was taken in for questioning where he confessed to the crime. He claimed he was 'upset' that his state handouts were to be halted and said it was an act of 'abject stupidity and foolishness'. Manchester Crown Court heard Harkin has previous convictions for the same offence in his home country. He also has a previous conviction for providing information to a terrorist as part a spate of offences in the early 1980s. Passing sentence Judge Leslie Hull told him: 'There was a sense of grievance towards the Department for Work and Pensions for the suspension of your benefits without, what you thought, was just cause. The scene was cordoned off for five hours after Harkin - who made the hoax bomb out of an analogue clock and wires - phoned 999 pretending to be a concerned passer-by . 'What was said about you was that this was a gesture you were making towards them. A gesture it may have been but none of the features which are dealt with justify what you did. 'Part of the menace of what you did is the fact that this would inevitably have been a distraction to the emergency services.' He added: 'There is a photo of the package which shows an analogue clock face, wires and a good deal of taping together. It may be reported as a realistic bomb. Certainly the emergency services had little option but to proceed upon the basis that it was real. 'The area was cordoned off and there was a degree of disruption. You have convictions recorded against you for similar offences in Northern Ireland and it has not escaped attention that this offence was the day after the 18th anniversary of the IRA bomb in Manchester. The hoax at the site was carried out the day after the 18th anniversary of the IRA bombings in Manchester . 'The courts have to do what they can to deter people such as you from doing this sort of thing.'The court heard that Harkin rang police at around 4.50am to tell them there was a 'suspicious package' outside the benefits agency and gave the address. Prosecutor David Lees said: 'At about 5am officers attended and located the phone box from which the defendant had made the telephone call and they found him. 'He pointed out where the device was and they found a brown paper package. Poking through was a full clock fires with wires coming out. 'He said he had been on state benefits for some time and had been on various courses to assist him. 'He had missed some of these courses and therefore the benefits agency had written to him indicating that his benefits were going to be suspended for three months. 'As a result he built the package with the intention of upsetting those who had been there.' In mitigation, defence counsel Joseph Hart said Harkin had suffered since his mother and wife had died and he felt he had been 'messed about' by the benefits agency. He said: 'The resentment had built up within him and he wanted to do something to bring home to the authorities his frustration and upset at the way he had been left high and dry. 'His initial thought was to prepare a banner and do a rooftop protest but in the depths of his paranoia and upset alighted on the idea of a bomb hoax. 'He has a distorted and confused image of what he was trying to achieve. 'The anniversary of the bombings wasn't something that preyed on his mind. He doesn't suggest that he has a particular political allegiance.'","William Harkin, 54, made the device using an analogue clock, wires and tape .

"A wheelchair user has attempted to 'Race The Tube' in a bid to raise awareness of London Underground access for disabled people. Anthony Ince was inspired by Londoner Jason Heptonstall's video in which viewers watched as he raced a Circle Line train, and won. The 43-year-old cerebral palsy-sufferer filmed the footage as he embarked on a similar challenge, racing 380 metres from Mansion House to the next stop - Cannon Street. Race The Tube: Wheelchair user Anthony Ince films his own challenge across London . Anthony attempted to race the Circle Line the 380 metres from Mansion House to Cannon Street station . In the footage, Londoner Mr Ince can be seen attempting to beat the train in just one minute 20 seconds. All is going well as he races his wheelchair off the Tube, through the ticket barrier, out of Mansion House and along the streets to Cannon Street. The video then cuts to the train Mr Ince is attempting to race against, as it pulls up at the station. Mr Ince would be in good time to make the Tube, however, he is confronted by a flight of stairs. Along with The Free Help Guy, Anthony recorded this video to raise awareness of the lack of step-free access . The video shows Mr Ince, who teamed up with blog The Free Help Guy for the challenge, sitting at the top of the stairs as the train leaves the station. The message on the footage says: 'Dear TFL, Please do more to help Anthony and other wheelchair users to take the London Underground. (Let alone race it).' It also claims that 75 per cent of Underground stations in London do not have step-free access at this time. Mr Ince races in his wheelchair from Mansion House to Cannon Street . Challenge: Mr Ince attempting to Race The Tube - and highlight the lack of step-free access at stations . The Free Help Guy writes on his blog: 'Mansion House, for example, is out of bounds for wheelchair users as it has many steps and no lifts (though the eagle eyed amongst you will notice we gave ourselves a bit of creative freedom during filming to try and illustrate the issue!). 'Whilst Transport for London, the organisation responsible for this issue across the capital, isn't ignoring the need to implement step-free access across stations, the 25 per cent figure they've reached to date is still a painfully small one.' He added: 'For Anthony, and many others in his situation, taking a simple journey across town involves a huge amount of planning, detours, time and effort. 'I feel like us wheelchair users are being ignored,' Anthony writes of the TFL system . 'Again, TFL have resources to help this journey planning - but getting your head around some of them is no easy task.' Anthony also wrote on the blog: 'I tend to just use buses. It's too difficult to know where I can and can't get to when I take the Tube. 'It feels like us wheelchair users are being ignored, despite how positively London came across during the Paralympics in 2012.'","Wheelchair user Anthony Ince filmed his own #RaceTheTube video .

Now, a year after the 12lb benign tumour was removed, Gilbert is all smiles with his adopted owner Scott Roberts. The surgery included blood transfusions and an IV catheter to keep him alive. To help build up the lost muscle mass, Gilbert underwent months of physical therapy before he was adopted. Finally, Scott took in the plucky grey dog and has given him a home so he can get on with his life. Keri Pink, from the rescue centre said it is a 'mystery' that the dog was able to survive for so long. She said: 'We were called to the isolation wing of a high-kill shelter and found Gilbert there. 'The tumour was so large he could barely stand under its weight. 'How on earth he had survived for so long is still a mystery to us all. 'He was a real trooper though and after the surgery he recovered really quickly. 'To compensate for the growth's mass, he lost a lot of muscle and it took a while for him to get his strength back.'

"Charles Ukachukwu Imoh was jailed for four years . A German man has been jailed after being caught trying to smuggle more than £200,000 worth of cocaine in 83 packages in his body. Charles Ukachukwu Imoh was stopped by police at Dover's Eastern Docks after telling officials he was visiting family in London having boarded a coach from Frankfurt. The 57-year-old, who is also has a Nigerian passport, was X-rayed at hospital where 83 packages were found in his body. Imoh, from Essen, was arrested and pleaded guilty to drug smuggling at Canterbury Crown Court last month. He was jailed for four years which, under the UK Borders Act 2007, means he will face automatic deportation. When tested, the drugs had a purity level of 66 per cent, and an estimated street value of more than £215,000. Paul Morgan, Director of Border Force South East and Europe said: 'Drug trafficking is a serious offence and those convicted will face prison sentences. 'Our message to those who would consider it is that it’s just not worth it. 'Border Force officers will continue to work diligently to keep our border secure and to make life as tough as possible for those who seek to profit from this evil trade.'

"Mary Kidson, 55, was cleared of harming her child by giving her medication that she did not need . A mother cleared of poisoning her daughter with a cocktail of drugs says her case should be used as a landmark ruling for parents who seek alternatives to the NHS. Mary Kidson was cleared by a jury after a three-week trial at Worcester Crown Court. The 55-year-old was accused of three counts of unlawfully and maliciously administering drugs, endangering life or inflicting grievous bodily harm, with all the offences alleged to have happened between 2010 and March 2013. Her daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given thyroid extract and oestrogen tablets. Ms Kidson was arrested in March last year after police searched her £475,000 home in Ledbury, Herefordshire, and found 'a very large amount' of medication. Speaking after being released, she said the NHS had a 'monopoly' on child health. 'This whole case raises the question of a parent’s right to go and find treatment outside the NHS for their child. 'Adults have total freedom to go where we want in the world [for healthcare] but when you’re a child it appears that only the NHS can treat you,' she told The Independent. Her comments come soon after the case of Ashya King,who was at the centre of an international manhunt after his parents took him out of Southampton General Hospital because they believed NHS treatment would have left the five-year-old deaf, blind and brain damaged. He has spent the last six weeks at the Czech Proton Therapy Centre where he has received 30 sessions of the pioneering treatment which his parents hope will be life-saving. Ms Kidson also spoke of her relief after she was cleared. She said: 'I just sobbed outside in the waiting area. When the verdicts were read it out, it was amazing, absolutely amazing.' She is now looking forward to being reunited with her daughter, although she does not know when this will happen. Paralells: Ashya King, five, is helped by his mother Naghmeh, 45, and father Brett, 51, down a hospital corridor in Prague, Czech Republic, following the last of his treatment . Dr Thierry Hertoghe, the Belgian doctor who treated her, called the whole situation a 'mess' and urged reform to give people the right to choose their doctor without fear of prosecution. During the three-week trial, prosecutors said she took her daughter 'doctor shopping' for a diagnosis. The jury heard how Ms Kidson had, over the years, taken her daughter to several different doctors and put her through a number of assessments to test for an autistic spectrum disorder, speech and language issues and hormonal conditions. Prosecutor John Causer told Worcester Crown Court that Kidson had gone from 'doctor to doctor' until she found one who 'told her what she wanted to hear'. Mary Kidson was acquitted on Wednesday at Worcester Crown Court, pictured. Now she wants her case to be used as a precedent for cases where parents seek medical care for their child away from the NHS . 'The daughter's health and emotional well-being we're harmed by being shopped around and saddled with treatment which was harmful to her. 'We're not saying that Mary Kidson set out to harm her daughter or that she is not a loving mother but the consequences of these actions - even of a loving mother - can be very harmful. 'Mrs Kidson has taken her daughter from doctor to doctor until she found one who told her what she wanted to hear.' NHS experts told the jury that the girl did not need any of the medication she was taking but the judge told the jury there was no evidence that grievous bodily harm had been caused or that there was a risk to the girl's life.","Mary Kidson, 55, was accused of trying to harm daughter .

"Women who live with their partners are more likely to accidentally become pregnant than those who are single or married, a new study has found. Researchers found most couples who live together said they intended to delay childbirth until they were married, steadily employed and financially stable. Despite this, surprise pregnancies are very common, with figures showing they account for half of all conceptions in the UK and U.S. Scroll down for video . Women who live with their partners are more likely to accidentally become pregnant than single or married women, according to U.S. researchers. Working class women were most likely to have a surprise pregnancy . Researchers found accidental pregnancy was especially common among working class couples who struggled to access reliable contraceptives and often forgot to use them. This was compared to middle-class couples where the women could access contraceptives more easily and tended to talk about contraception more openly with their partners. The study was conducted in the U.S. where unlike the UK, contraceptives are not free and are generally included in health insurance plans. Men in middle class relationships often helped ensure their partners used contraception, by reminding them about it, helping them set alarms, or by paying for prescriptions. In the study, middle class couples were characterised as being university-educated and having a job that required a degree. The study, carried out by social scientists from Cornell University and the University of Indianapolis involved 61 middle class and working class  couples who lived together. They were quizzed about their relationships and their use of contraception. They study found that women in cohabiting couples were the most likely to become accidentally pregnant, with working class women more likely to have a surprise pregnancy than middle class women. Working class women in the U.S. reported that job instability or unemployment left them without health insurance or health plans that covered contraceptives. Lead author Professor Sharon Sassler, from Cornell University, said: 'Women who are on the same page as their partners regarding childbirth and who are able to communicate with partners are more efficacious contraceptors. Middle class couples living together used contraceptives more effectively and talked about them more openly. Men helped their partners by reminding them about contraceptives and paying for prescriptions . 'Since it is the middle-class women who are more likely to be in this position, they are therefore in greater control of their reproductive destiny than their working-class counterparts.' She added that the research looked at the barriers facing working class women. She said: 'Women mentioned the cost of going for a doctor's visit; paying for birth control pills, which insurance once had covered but no longer did; or not being able to afford the out-of-pocket expense on insurance plans with meagre coverage as barriers.' She added that this was one of the only studies to include men's perspectives on family planning and contraceptive use. She said: 'We find that men are often involved in ensuring contraception is regularly used – whether by reminding partners, helping them program their phone or helping to pay for a prescription that is too expensive. 'Social marketing programs can target male partners to participate in deferring pregnancy until couples are ready – relationally, emotionally and financially – to become parents.' The study was published in the journal Family Relations.","Around 50% of pregnancies in the UK and U.S. are unplanned .

"A mother and a stepfather are facing child abuse and neglect charges after a three-year-old boy was found with burns on '85 per cent of his body'. Nakita Morton, 22, left her son Zander Brown alone with 31-year-old Eric Morton at the home they shared with her parents in Campbell County, Tennessee, on the morning of September 16. At some point before 10am, the boy suffered second-degree burns to his head, neck, chest, abdomen, back and legs while in Eric's care, officials said. Zander's uncle, David Brown, said the burns covered around 85 per cent of his body, saying: 'Basically from his nose up is all that's not burned. Everything is burned.' In hospital: Nakita Morton left her son Zander Brown (pictured) alone with her husband Eric at their home in Campbell County, Tennesse. While she was gone, the child suffered second-degree burns to his body . Awaiting trial: When Nakita (left) returned, Eric (right) told her about Zander's injuries, but they did not seek medical treatment, it is alleged. The couple are now facing charges of child abuse and neglect . When Nakita  returned, Eric told her about the injuries, but they did not seek medical treatment for fear of children's services or law enforcement officials getting involved, it is alleged. Even when Nakita's father arrived home at 11am and suggested taking Zander to hospital, Eric reportedly refused to permit it. The same happened at 11.30am, when Nakita's mother returned. It was only shortly after 12.30pm that the couple allowed Zander's grandparents to take him to LaFollette Medical Center, where he was also found to have bruises on various parts of his body. The boy was then airlifted to Vanderbilt University hospital, according to WATE.com. Innocent: Following an examination at the hospital, Zander's burns were found to not be accidental nor self-inflicted, but intentional. The three-year-old (pictured) remains in a critical but stable condition at hospital . Following an examination at the hospital, Zander's burns were found to not be accidental nor self-inflicted, but intentional.  Officials agreed the injuries did not appear consistent with an accident. Zander remains in a critical but stable condition at hospital, Campbell County Sheriff's Office said. In the wake of Zander's examinations, Nakita and Eric were arrested by police. Eric has since been charged with aggravated child neglect for allegedly failing or refusing to provide medical treatment. He has also been accused of aggravated child abuse by intentionally burning his stepson, although it is not clear in what way he might have caused the burns. Jail: Nakita and Eric, both of whom deny the charges, are being held at Campbell County Jail (pictured) Meanwhile, Nicki has been charged with aggravated child neglect for the same reason as her husband. The couple, both of whom deny the charges, are being held at Campbell County Jail. Judge Amanda Sammons has set their bail at $750,000 each and appointed them both attorneys, according to WBIR.com. Speaking this week, Campbell County Sheriff Robbie Goins said he was determined to get justice for Zander, saying: 'We feel like we're his voice and we want to get him justice.' He added: 'We are saddened by the horrific acts that we believe this child suffered through the abuse and neglect of both individuals respectively charged in this crime. 'Unspeakable acts of child abuse and neglect will not stand by any of us. Our prayers will continue to flow above for this child's care, health, and full recovery.'","Nakita Morton, 22, 'left her son Zander Brown alone with  husband Eric'

"A Halloween-obsessed homeowner is terrifying his small Pennsylvania neighborhood with blood-splattered dolls, severed plastic heads and even a cannibal bunny in his front yard. The house of horrors in Brookline, Pittsburgh has been causing  a controversy, with some people in the neighborhood demanding it be taken down, WPXI reported. But homeowner and creator Joe D'Auria insists his handiwork gets more laughs than tears. He said he has been decorating the home for 20 years and grows his collection of ghoulish figures each year by scouring stores or online shops, or by making the horrifying characters from scratch.

Terrifying: He said he has only ever had complaints about some of the plastic dolls on the fence . This year, his lawn is strewn with bloodied limbs, a skeleton in chains and hanging heads. Possessed baby dolls line cages - which he picked up from flea markets - while hanging along the fences are more plastic dolls with black eyes and signs across their chests reading: 'Help me.' And sitting on the porch is a large pink stuffed rabbit - with blood gushing from its mouth. Although WPXI reported that it was startling some members of the neighborhood, D'Auria insisted it was all in good fun and had only ever had one complaint about the plastic dolls.

"A seven-month-old baby choked to death on a pistachio shell he found on his parent's carpet while crawling on the floor, an inquest hear. Gauravdeep Bassi swallowed the shell which blocked his windpipe and died in hospital on November 17 last year. The death of Gauravdeep, from Hill Top, West Midlands, was ruled to have been an accident. Tragedy: Gauravdeep Bassi, seven months, died in November last year after choking on a pistachio shell . His mother Rajwinder Kaur, 37, told the inquest that her son was on the floor when she suddenly noticed he was struggling to breathe and phoned for an ambulance. Paramedics arrived and unsuccessfully tried to find what was causing the obstruction in the little boy's windpipe. He was then rushed to hospital, and the nut shell was eventually removed, but Gauravdeep was pronounced dead just one hour after his mother had called an ambulance. Black Country Coroner Zafar Siddique said the baby's death was 'no-one's fault' at an inquest at Smethwick Coroners Court on Monday. He said: 'My conclusion was this was an accident. It was clear he picked up a pistachio shell and swallowed it and it has become lodged. This was no-one's fault.' Accident: The baby boy had found the shell on the carpet in his parents' home and swallowed in, after which it became lodged in his windpipe . His mother Rajwinder Kaur, 37, said her son was on the floor when she suddenly noticed he was struggling to breathe and phoned for an ambulance . Scene: The incident, ruled an accidental death, took place at the family home in Hill Top, West Midlands . Gauravdeep's mum Rajwinder, told the inquest how she witnessed her son struggling to at their home. She said: 'I was cleaning away toys at the time and I do not know when the baby got down on the floor. 'No-one saw him pick up the shell. I heard his breathing and knew something was wrong. 'I did not know it was a nut shell, I just knew he had put something in his mouth. I called for an ambulance. 'When they arrived they checked his breathing and his neck and took him straight away.' Paramedic Amy Gilsenan said the baby was unconscious when she arrived at the house a colleague. Every parent's nightmare: Gauravdeep arrived at Sandwell General Hospital just 12 minutes after his mother called for an ambulance, but his life could not be saved . She said: 'I noticed there was some resistance (in giving oxygen). The obstruction was down in the airway, but nothing was visible to remove.' Gauravdeep was then rushed to Sandwell General Hospital, arriving at 4.30pm, 12 minutes after his mother called for an ambulance. Consultant Mohamed Wani said a check on the baby's wind pipe found the nut shell, but a first attempt to remove the shell was unsuccessful. An intensive care unit consultant was called and the shell was removed at 4.50pm but he was pronounced dead at 5.13pm. Dr Wani said once the brain lost oxygen supply for more than ten minutes it was 'impossible' to survive, adding: 'There was nothing which could be done.' Pathologist Tamas Mouton said the baby's death was caused by the blockage to his airway.","Gauravdeep Bassi, seven months, died in November last year .

"Sending people to Mars may be impossible due to an increased radiation risk from cosmic rays, claims a study. It's thought that a predicted decrease in solar activity will raise the levels of radiation astronauts are subjected to from cosmic rays on a deep space mission. This will increase the risk of suffering sickness, cancer and more on lengthy trips to the red planet lasting about a year to levels beyond what is considered safe. A study from the University of New Hampshire suggests missions to Mars (illustrated) might be impossible due to an increased risk of radiation. Research suggests when sun is less active cosmic rays increase. This lowers the amount of time an astronaut can safely stay in space . The research, published in the journal Space Weather, was led by Dr Nathan Schwadron of the University of New Hampshire. In the research it was found that a 30-year-old astronaut can spend about one year in space before cosmic rays raises the radiation-risk beyond safe exposure limits. A long-standing puzzle in astrophysics is the source of ultra-high-energy particles from space that hit Earth. Called cosmic rays, they're up to a billion times more energetic than particles at Cern's Large Hadron Collider. They strike the atmosphere and cause an enormous shower of other particles, mostly muons, electrons and photons, over a wide area. Though they were discovered decades ago, cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare, making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated. It's thought that some come from supernovas, but it's likely there are other sources of cosmic rays in the universe as well. That's just enough time to get to Mars and back. However, many scientists predict that the sun's activity is weakening, which would mean the number of days a human could spend in space before reaching the limit is less than thought. In fact, the next solar minimum could decrease the time by 20 per cent – making a mission to Mars much more difficult and possibly life-threatening. Nasa sets limits on how much radiation it is safe for an astronaut to be exposed to. In the research it was found that it would take 400 days for a 30-year-old male astronaut to reach the maximum radiation does in the last solar minimum. For a female, this drops to just 300 days. More worryingly, if solar activity continues to decrease, then men could be allowed just 320 days in space, and women just 240 days. This would make a mission to Mars for a man difficult, but for women it would be all but impossible without them succumbing to serious effects of radiation. 'While these conditions are not necessarily a showstopper for long-duration missions to the moon, an asteroid, or even Mars, galactic cosmic ray radiation in particular remains a significant and worsening factor that limits mission durations,' says Dr Schwadron. 'These data are a fundamental reference for the radiation hazards in near Earth 'geospace' out to Mars and other regions of our sun's vast heliosphere.' Cosmic rays originate outside the solar system - possibly in supernovas - and travel through the universe. The solar wind, however, can push back this radiation (shown) and prevent it causing too many harmful effects. It is predicted solar activity will continue to decrease in future, increasing levels of cosmic rays . The sun's activity is known to have a clockwork 11-year cycle, with approximately six to eight-year lulls in activity (solar minimum) followed by two to three-year periods when the sun is more active (solar maximum) Cosmic rays originate outside the solar system - possibly in supernovas - and travel through the universe. The solar wind, however, can push back this radiation and prevent it causing too many harmful effects. Yesterday science writer Kate Greene, who took part in a simulated mission to the red planet, argued that the first mission to the red planet should be crewed by only women. Last year she took part in a Nasa project called Hi-Seas (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation), which simulated a long-duration mission to Mars on Earth. Ms Greene and five other crewmembers - three men and three women in total - spent four months in a dome on Hawaii, only leaving the habitat in mock spacesuits. She says it was rare for a woman to burn more than 2,000 calories a day, whereas men regularly exceeded 3,000. Her conclusion is that sending women to Mars would be cheaper and more feasible than one with men. However, this latest research suggests that such a mission by be limited by the amount of time the crew could stay in deep space before succumbing to harmful effects of radiation exposure. But during periods of decreased solar activity, the cosmic radiation levels increase to a point that would be harmful to future space explorers, according to the study. The sun's activity is known to have a clockwork 11-year cycle, with approximately six to eight-year lulls in activity (solar minimum) followed by two to three-year periods when the sun is more active (solar maximum). In 2006 the longest solar minimum ever recorded was observed, which brought about the highest intensity of galactic cosmic rays, according to the study. This created worsening radiation hazards that would potentially threaten deep space astronaut missions. The high radiation levels seen during the sun's last minimum cycle limits the days astronauts could remain safely in space, even behind special shielding against radiation. This means that the number of days an astronaut can safely stay in space decreases during a solar minimum. The data was gathered by the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (Crater) on Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). At the heart of Crater is material called 'tissue equivalent plastic' - a stand-in for human muscle capable of gauging radiation dosage.

"A father of seven called his wife to ask if she loved him any more and died after starting an explosion in his garage when she told him she didn't, an inquest heard. Stuart Mathers, 42, died instantly in the fire which tore through the garage at his home in Kingswood, Hull, Hull Coroner's Court was told. The inquest into his death heard that his marriage to Natalie, a police officer, was 'coming to an end' when he called her in the early hours of June 11 this year. Stuart Mathers, 42, asked his wife if she loved him and started a fire which killed him when she said 'No' Scene: Mr Mathers died in a fire in the garage next to his house in Kingswood, Hull, earlier this year . Mrs Mathers said: 'Our marriage was coming to an end.  I told Stuart that evening that it was over and then I left earlier than normal to start my 10pm shift at work, at about 8.30pm. 'I had a missed call from him when I was on duty at just gone midnight and I called him back.  He answered, before saying: ""Do you love me?"" When Mrs Mathers arrived home she tried to get into the house to save Mr Mathers, but found the front door was locked . 'I said ""No"" and that it was not about that. 'He immediately replied with: ""Right then, the dog is outside and there is a fire at our house"". 'He was very serious and blunt and I believed he was going to do it.' When Mrs Mathers arrived home at 12.30am she found the garage in flames and her neighbours, who had been woken by explosions coming from the garage, on the street. She said she desperately tried to get into the house but the front door was locked and a neighbour dragged her away from the burning building. Police officers who had arrived at the scene eventually forced entry into the house and began searching for Mr Mathers, a doorman, but his body was found beneath rubble in the garage by firefighters tackling the blaze. The inquest heard that Mr Mathers, who had been drinking alcohol before he died, had left a note for his wife on a worktop in the kitchen, along with a wedding ring and a number of £20 notes. Mrs Mathers said: 'I never thought Stuart would do anything as extreme as that.. What he did was completely out of character.' Debbie Mathers, his sister, told the inquest he had called her numerous times in the hours before his death to arrange for a taxi to deliver his things to her house. He told her: 'You will be receiving some of my belongings soon. You know what to do with them.' Miss Mathers said: 'We had several phone conversations on the Tuesday night. Stuart had been drinking but he didn't seem drunk. He was adamant that his relationship was over and he was down about that. Floral tributes outside Diva's Bar in Hull where Mr Mathers, a father of seven, worked as a doorman . 'They had split up the week before but they got back together. 'When a taxi pulled up outside my house with his stuff inside, I just thought he was going to move out of their home. 'What he did was so out of character. He was a lovely man - respected by all.' Stephen Henry, from Humberside Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'Both doors to the garage had been locked from inside and both sets of keys were found on Stuart. 'I believe the explosion would have been very big and it is likely he died instantly.' On the night he died, Mr Mathers had met his daughter from a previous marriage to give her £90 for her birthday, the court heard. Delivering a narrative verdict, assistant coroner David Rosenburg said: 'Stuart Mathers took his own life while suffering severe emotional stress and under the influence of alcohol so he would not have appreciated the consequences of his actions.

"Spiders - more of them and bigger than before - are coming to your home. New research from the University of Sydney suggests more spiders now prefer urban environments to their natural habitats. Scroll down for video . Lizzie Lowe, a PhD student from the University of Sydney, studied spiders in 73 private gardens and compared them to six urban parks . She found that many species increasingly appear to prefer urban environments to rural areas . PhD student Lizzie Lowe studied spiders in 73 private gardens and compared them to six urban parks, six patches of remnant vegetation and five bushland sites. Her findings suggest spiders are increasingly opting for domestic locales. 'Over 4500 spiders from 160 species were collected and identified. There were just as many spiders in Sydney backyards as in bushland, and there were more species in patches of bush within the city than in National Parks,' Ms Lowe said. Ms Lowe's research also indicates spiders in urban areas are growing larger and breeding more than in the past . Another recent study by Lowe suggested spiders are opting for the more affluent suburbs, where they are larger and more fertile than elsewhere. In a seperate study, Lowe found that urban spiders are also growing larger and breeding more than in the past. Thankfully, more dangerous breeds of spiders do not appear to be joining the urban migration. 'The only dangerous species of spiders are redbacks and funnel-web, and we aren't seeing a growth in those species in households,' Ms Lowe said. Ms Lowe is presenting her research at the Ecological Society of Australia conference in Alice Springs. 'I am interested in the wildlife in cities because maintaining biodiversity in urban areas is essential for both the conservation of native species and the wellbeing of people living there,' she said. Lowe says there were just as many spiders in Sydney backyards as in bush land, and there were more species in patches of bush within the city than in National Parks .

"Most holidaymakers will bring back a suitcase full of souvenirs and a rapidly fading suntan from their foreign travels. But the chances are they will also return with a stack of leftover holiday money. In fact, a new survey has revealed that Britons are currently hoarding a total of almost £3bn in unused foreign currency from their travels abroad. A new survey has revealed that Britons are currently hoarding a total of almost £3bn in unused foreign currency from their travels abroad . Two thirds of the UK population admit to stashing away their holiday cash, rather than converting it back into pounds. The average household now has an average of £110.45 in leftover cash post trip according to the study by Zopa, a peer-to-peer lending company. It adds up to £2.92billion of discarded currency across the country. The study revealed that only 13 per cent of people bother to exchange money when they return from a holiday, with just 16 per cent of those asked saying they plan to use it the next time they go away, meaning that most of it goes unused. Two thirds of people questioned said they had two or more types of foreign currency at home. Seventy-nine pSeventy-nine per cent of people admitted to having euros, 43 per cent had US dollarser cent of people questioned admitted to hoarding euros, while 43 per cent had US dollars . Seventy-nine per cent of people admitted to having euros, 43 per cent had US dollars, seven per cent had Canadian dollars and Swiss Francs, six per cent had Australian dollars and five per cent had Thai baht. Holidaymakers who want to sell back their foreign currency are often faced with poor rates of exchange when trying to sell their foreign money back. A Zopa spokesman has advised that holidaymakers convert their money straight into the next currency they will be using abroad to avoid the cost of exchanging it into pounds and then back again. Travel companies often advise donating leftover coins to charities, with major organisations such as the Alzheimer’s Society, Age UK, Barnardo's and Oxfam all running schemes whereby travellers can donate unwanted foreign coins to them at their branches. The study revealed that only 13 per cent of people bother to exchange money when they return from a holiday . Some airlines also perform collections during flights, while there are also collection boxes for charities at airports. Travel experts have also advised that one of the cheapest and easiest ways to exchange travel cash is to sell it to a friend at the same rate you bought it for. They suggest that not only will travellers be able to get the same rate that they bought it for, but both parties will be able to cut out any commission and fees charged by currency exchange companies. While many of the popular currency providers don’t often list on their websites how much they will buy back currency for, some firms offers a ‘buy back’ scheme. Travelex, Sainsbury's, Moneycorp, Post Office and the Currency Club all offer this services where they will buy back currency sometimes at the rate customers bought it at. However, this can come at an extra charge and you will have to have bought it from them in the first place. Alternatively for travellers who have been abroad with family and friends, experts have suggested that customers might be able to negotiate a better exchange rate by putting all the cash together before selling it back. Bob Atkinson, travel expert, from Travelsupermarket.com says: ‘Large transactions of a few hundred pounds worth can be negotiated on – the more you are wanting to change back, the better the deal you will get on major currencies.’","Average household has an average of £110.45 in leftover cash post trip .

"She's one of the most powerful women in British television, and her shows Last Tango In Halifax and Happy Valley are watched by devoted audiences of millions. But the Bafta-winning writer Sally Wainwright says the viewer she tries hardest to please is her mother Dorothy. Interviewed for today’s edition of Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, she says of her mother: ‘I often listen to my mum. She is the person I write for.’ Triumph: Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi in the hit BBC1 series Last Tango in Halifax . Dorothy keeps a particularly close eye on Last Tango In Halifax because it is loosely based on her own life. Starring Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi, the BBC1 comedy-drama follows the fortunes of two childhood sweethearts who fall in love again when they meet by chance when they are in their 70s. Dorothy herself married her childhood sweetheart, Alec Walker, after they met again years later online. Wainwright says her mother has reservations about the series, which led to the writer’s Bafta success last year, adding: ‘She worries that people will take it all a bit too literally. Obviously I made a lot up – you have to because you have to fill six hours. My mum met Alec online and they completely fell in love with each other and it was all beautiful but that doesn’t make great drama. You need things to go wrong before the drama can kick in.’ Wainwright, who worked for 18 months as a bus driver, says her mother came to her rescue when she got her first big break writing for The Archers. She says: ‘I didn’t know anything about it, I am ashamed to say. My mum gave me a crash course on who everybody was and she took me through all the storylines and helped me construct my story for my trial script.’ Starring Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi, the BBC1 comedy-drama follows the fortunes of two childhood sweethearts who fall in love again when they meet by chance when they are in their 70s .

She adds: ‘Murder isn’t entertainment. It’s horrible, real and disgusting. I don’t know how detectives work. I couldn’t do what they do.’ The TV drama Rock Follies Of 77 has perhaps had the biggest influence on her career, Wainwright says, and the song The Band Who Wouldn’t Die from the 1970s show is one of her music choices.","Bafta-winning writer says she tries hardest to please her mother Dorothy .

That was way too casual. It was very regretful,'Chung Jin-suk, secretary general at the Korean National Assembly, was quoted by ABC News as saying. Korean media reported that Gates has caused similar controversy in the past when meeting the country's leaders. In 2002, Gates gave a two-handed shake to the late Kim Dae-jung but in 2008 gave President Lee Myung-Bak's a 'disrespectful' handshake. It has led to speculation in South Korea that it was done deliberately and reflects his political preference. No one from the Gates camp of the presidential palace has commented. This ok sign would be considered vulgar in Greece or Turkey . It is not only in South Korea that greetings can prove offensive. In Japan, it is impolite not to bow lower than the other person when greeting or thanking them. A handshake can also be a faux pas in France if a kiss on the cheek would have been more appropriate. Shoes and feet can be an etiquette minefield in different parts of the world. Not taking shoes off in Maori or Muslim sacred spaces is very rude. In Finland and Scandinavian countries, not removing shoes when entering someone's home is also discourteous. Clothes are also very important in temples and churches. People should not enter a church in Italy with bare legs or arms and that rule generally applies to other religions. In Buddhist temples, it is important to sit with feet tucked under so that they do not point at the Buddha. Whereas a pat on the head can is affectionate in much of the Western world, it is very rude in Thailand. In Buddhism the head is the most pure region of the body. In the UK and America, the humble okay sign is a positive gesture but in Greece and Turkey it is seen as very vulgar. Eating with your left hand in India and Middle Eastern countries is also considered rude as it is reserved for bodily hygiene and thought of as unclean. Giving a clock or a watch as a gift in China or Taiwan may be regarded as a faux-pas, as it traditionally associated with counting the seconds to the recipient's death.","Picture of meeting splashed on front of national newspapers .

"Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said a quarter of Premier League players were black — but not a single manager . Premiership football clubs should be forced to interview at least one black candidate every time they appoint a new manager, a Labour MP has said. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said a quarter of Premier League players were black — but not a single manager. Across English football's four professional divisions there are just two black managers. Mr Umunna said it was time to introduce the 'Rooney rule' – first introduced in American Football in 2003 to boost the number of black and ethnic minority coaches. The principle was introduced by Dan Rooney – not Wayne, the Manchester United player – an NFL club owner who introduced a rule where at least one non-white candidate must be interviewed when a manager's job comes up. Mr Umunna said: 'It's made a real difference in American football. Voices from both inside and outside the game, including PFA Chief Gordon Taylor, have said there is a strong case for examining this proposal and whether it can be introduced in English football. 'Personally, I have a lot of sympathy for this and would think it deserves consideration.' Mr Umunna made the remarks in a speech in Brixton to mark Black History Week. The Streatham MP said: 'We can't carry on like this — this has to change. Can we really say to our young people that we rate their physical ability more than their other talents?' He also called for more action to boost the number of black and Asian people in university management and company boardrooms, suggesting there should be compulsory reporting by firms on their diversity, just as they have to reveal how many women get directorships. Mr Umunna's father was on the board at Crystal Palace and was the only African director of any Premier League club when the league was launched in 1992. But he said: 'Things haven't changed much in 22 years. Look at Premier League clubs now and you'll see most have no people of colour on their boards or in any senior roles. 'Out of 92 professional league clubs, there are currently only two black managers.' Sport was often held up as 'an arena in which barriers have been broken' but the MP said: 'We rightly cheer the success of our many black footballers ... But take a look off the pitch, where a lot of power is wielded, and you see a different story.' Television and newspapers also failed to reflect their audience, he said, pointing out that Amol Rajan, the editor of the Independent, is currently the only BME journalist to run a newspaper. 'How can you present an accurate portrait and reflect the experience of people of colour in our country, if those very people do not sit at your top table?' he asked.

Carlisle United's Keith Curle and Huddersfield Town's Chris Powell are the only two black managers throughout the 92 professional clubs in the Premier and Football Leagues.

"Thousands of planes are 'flying blind without radar' when they land at regional airports because Airservices Australia has refused to comply with safety instructions, aviator and entrepreneur Dick Smith has warned. The millionaire and former chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority claimed that lives are being put at risk because the AA has been 'completely irresponsible' in not implementing a 2004 ministerial safety directive relating to radar at 10 airports. Albury, Alice Springs, Coffs Harbour, Hamilton Island, Hobart, Launceston, Mackay, Maroochydore, Rockhampton and Tamworth airports currently do not use radar for incoming flights. 'They have to obey the ministerial directive and they have not obeyed it purely so they can make more profits,' Mr Smith told Daily Mail Australia. Former chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority Dick Smith said profits are being put before safety at regional airports across Australia . In 2004 a ministerial safety directive told CASA to implement radar systems for air traffic controllers at 10 regional airports but ten years later these airports still do not have radar . He warned the AA board members that not implementing radar technology means 'they will be personally liable and they will lose their houses' if an accident occurs. The implementation was supposed to have taken one year but has still not been carried out after 10 years. Mr Smith said that although there have not been any accidents because of a lack of radar so far, it is only a matter of time. 'It hasn't caused a crash yet but you don't have a ministerial safety directive that requires something to be implemented for no reason. Eventually there will be an accident... it's obvious that if you don't install it that eventually you will have an accident.' He explained that the category of air space that the airports use 'requires radar to operate properly'. Alice Springs is one of the regional airports that was advised to install radar technology in 2004 . Hamilton Island airport, where thousands of tourists fly into every year, was also told to get radar . 'It means if you are flying an aircraft it's on the radar screen. But at the moment they are flying blind without radar. Air traffic control have to call them up and work out where they are and they say ""20 miles"" away,' Mr Smith said. According to 2010 data from The Civil Aviation Authority thousands of planes fly out of the 10 regional airports every year: . Implementing radar services at the regional airports would cost tens of millions of dollars and Mr Smith believes this is the reason why the safety directive has been ignored. 'They have worked out that if they don't put the radar in and if they force the industry to put black boxes in instead they would make higher profits.' Responding to legal advice issued by Mr Smith to Airservices Australia in relation to the radars, AA chairman Air Chief Marshal Houston, told the The Australian: 'Airservices has continued to progress technological and operational changes to enhance the safety of our services in regional Australia. 'There are now advanced technologies which in the near ­future will, to a large extent, replace radar surveillance.' However, Mr Smith refuted Mr Houston's claims that the airports are using new safety technology instead of radars. 'Their answer is modern technology will save money but it hasn't come in to use yet. They are putting profit in front of safety,' he said. In a 2010 report that reassessed the ministerial advice, The Civil Aviation Authority noted: 'Radar is no longer the only technology available to provide surveillance to ATC. The introduction of satellite systems, air-to-ground data links and the emergence of new techniques provide surveillance coverage to ATC and will eventually replace the use of radar systems. 'Radar is considered to be old technology and is expensive to install and maintain when compared to newer technologies.' The report also noted the high cost of installing radar technology and admitted that: 'The level of radar coverage surrounding the 10 Regional Aerodromes has not changed since the Ministerial Direction was given in 2004 although the TASWAM network has improved coverage in Tasmania.' In 2010, there were 6,263 RPT flights a year from the Sunshine Coast Airport .","Entrepreneur Dick Smith says 2004 ministerial safety directive which said radars should be installed at 10 regional airports has been ignored .

"A Chinese man has turned staging suicide attempts into a money making scheme, by threatening to jump to his death unless he is paid cash. The attempts by the man, identified only as 47-year-old Mr Li, have been so frequent in the central province of Jiangxi that local media has named him 'Brother Building-jumper'. Mr Li has been climbing buildings and scaffolding at construction sites on a 'tour of suicide extortion' which he is said to have taken across seven provinces. 'Brother Building-jumper': Mr Li, 47, has been threatening to jump to his death from scaffolding and high buildings unless he is paid cash (stock image) Mr Li's various 'fake suicide attempts' have made him a minor celebrity on China's social networks, with online commentators both applauding his business acumen, and calling on him to carry out his threat. 'Li would often make his suicide threats in busy public places or on open construction sites and demand cash from owners or his rescuers,' the state-run Global Times said Wednesday, citing police. The former air conditioner installer has carried out the scam in more than seven provinces since 2011, the newspaper said, without giving a total number of fake suicide attempts. Police in Jiangxi finally arrested him when he threatened to jump from the sixth floor of a building under construction over claims for unpaid back pay, it added. Money making: Mr Li has carried out the scam in more than seven provinces since 2011 and accumulated 12,000 yuan(£1,217), over the years, local media reports (stock image) 'Officers took Li into custody after (they) lured him down with promises of 800 yuan(£81),' the newspaper said. Li, from the eastern province of Jiangsu, was said to have extorted 12,000 yuan(£1,217) in total. Multiple news websites dubbed him 'Brother Building-jumper', and he was a popular topic on China's message boards and local versions of social media. 'Moral degeneracy is currently one of China's special characteristics,' one blasted on Sina Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter. 'Let him jump!' said another. 'He does have a knack for good business,' said one of Mr Li's defenders, while another added: 'This kind of behaviour is an art form.'","Chinese man accused of 'faking' being suicidal in order to make money .

"A guard who lost his job after taking a photo during a visit from President Obama has spoken out about being fired - saying it was 'unjust'. Kenneth Tate, 47, a security guard who worked at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, embarrassed the Secret Service and was thrown into a political firestorm last month - but has said all he wanted out of the encounter was a picture to show his 81-year-old mom. He was fired from his $42,000 job after getting too close to the President's security detail during a visit on September 16, and taking a picture of the assembled cars. 'Injustice': Kenneth Tate, 47, said he unfairly lost his job after he took a photograph during a visit by President Obama - and also embarrassed the Secret Service by riding next to him in an elevator while armed . Speaking to the New York Times in the wake of the sacking, Tate called the events which lost him his position 'a nightmare' and 'unjust'. He also spoke out about the scandal that erupted when it emerged he was armed during the encounter with Obama - contrary to rules which state that only Secret Service agents can have firearms in the President's presence. The revelation came as an embarrassment to the service, which was still reeling from accusations of incompetence after letting a man armed with a knife hop the White House fence and charge inside. Secret Service Director Julia Pearson resigned soon after. Tate says he was never told to surrender his gun, and was in the elevator because it was his job. He told the Times: 'From the reports, I was some stranger that entered the elevator. I mean, I was appointed.' 'Tarnished': Tate is now unemployed after losing his CDC job, and says his good name has been smeared . Before it emerged the day had cost him his livelihood, Tate said he was proud to have met the President - who shook his hand and asked his name. A Secret Service agent apparently quipped that this was remarkable, as he had never been acknowledged by Obama in two years. But speaking later, he said the day tarnished his reputation. He said: 'It's a nightmare. My whole life's been changed upside-down.' 'How do you go anywhere when it seems like the doors have been closed on you, your reputation tarnished, the embarrassment? Recalling the encounter, he said: 'He [Obama] acknowledged me, he asked me what my name was and extended his hand and shook my hand. 'I was trying to get a picture of them leaving, and I was unsuccessful. 'At the end part I tried to take a picture of them leaving. The motorcade was driving, they were parked, getting ready to leave. 'I tried to get a picture for my mom, she's 81 years old, just to show that I had met the President. 'When I got back the agents stated that somebody was going to lose their job, because nobody ever got that close to the motorcade. 'I didn't know it was going to be me. 'Two days later I was told to bring my statement in - when I was bringing my statement in the captain told me I didn't need it because the CDC had already taken me off the contract.' Tate, who is now unemployed, has never been given an official explanation for his sacking. He was not directly employed by the CDC, but worked for a company called Professional Security Corporation. His son, who also worked at the CDC headquarters, also lost his job two weeks later - which the organization blamed on 'downsizing'. A Secret Service source indicated that Tate's account is a fair summary of what happened that day - though an executive at his old company told the Times his description was 'not correct' - but would not elaborate. Embarrassment: Revelations about Obama's CDC visit came as the Secret Service was under fire - and resulted in the resignation of its director, Julia Pearson (pictured)","Kenneth Tate, 47, was a security guard with the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia .

"A breast cancer survivor who underwent a double mastectomy before giving birth to her first and only child has hit back at critics for shaming her for feeding him formula. Journalist Emily Wax-Thibodeaux, from Washington, D.C., was 32 when she was told she probably had breast cancer, and, since it ran in her family, she elected to do radiation and have a double mastectomy with reconstruction. Due to the surgery, she was unable to to breastfeed when her baby Lincoln was born five years later - but that didn't stop mothers and nurses from pressuring her to do so. Scroll down for video . Mom knows best: Breast cancer survivor Emily Wax-Thibodeaux, who underwent a double mastectomy before giving birth to her son Lincoln (pictured), has hit back at critics for shaming her for feeding him formula . 'For me, formula has been so vilified that I felt as if I was constantly explaining my situation,' Emily writes in the Washington Post. In one instance, while giving her then-three-month-old formula at a baby-and-me yoga class, one of the other mothers gave her the unsolicited advice: 'You know, breastfeeding is optimal.' And a Facebook friend commented on one of her husband's photos, which showed him giving Lincoln a bottle: 'So you're not breastfeeding? It's better you know?' Everywhere she went, women and mothers would shame her for not breastfeeding, propagating the commonly held belief that 'breast is best'. In reality, however, recent studies have shown that breast milk may be no better for a newborn than formula. But when Emily sent the study to her friends, hoping to open their eyes to alternative views, one friend even offered to give her some of her own breast milk that she had frozen. 'The irony, of course, is that women who breastfed in the 1970s say they were judged for being crunchy Earth mothers by those who gave the bottle,' writes Emily. 'Now they are considered mainstream and judging formula feeders. Can’t we all just get along?' Emily explains that the first instance of formula shame occurred in the hospital the day Lincoln was born. Even after the new mom told the lactivists who came to her hospital room that she was going to use formula, they insisted: 'You really should breastfeed.' The angered mother recalls: 'So, holding my day-old newborn on what was one of the most blissful days of my life, I had to tell the aggressive band of well-intentioned strangers my whole cancer saga.' Unsolicited advice: On one instance, a Facebook friend commented on one of her husband's photos, which showed him giving Lincoln a bottle: 'So you're not breastfeeding? It's better you know?' One nurse persisted even after hearing Emily's story, telling her: 'It may come out anyway, or through your armpits.' But when she consulted her breast surgeon Shawna Wiley, who works at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, she told her that the goal of a mastectomy is to remove as much breast tissue as possible. As such, 'There should be no milk production,' explained the nurse. What's more, pressuring a mother to breast feed when she cannot or doesn't want to - especially after a traumatic experience like cancer - can have negative effects. 'I think that women who have made the difficult decision to have bilateral mastectomies have already grieved the loss of not being able to breast feed,' she says. 'No group should make a woman feel guilty about the decisions she made . . . or make her feel inadequate about not being able to lactate.' Unneccessary: 'For me, formula has been so vilified that I felt as if I was constantly explaining my situation,' Emily writes . Emily is not alone in her frustration; when she sent the study to her friends, some women responded that they, too, have been made to feel ashamed for not breastfeeding. 'Some women shared that they wished they could stop breast-feeding so they could leave the house for more than three hours at a time. Or so the father or grandparent could give a bottle. Or because it hurt,' she writes. 'Or because they needed to work and couldn't spend long breaks pumping. Or because they adopted their child and couldn’t. Or because they just didn’t want to.' And reactions to her article have been mostly positive, with one fellow parent calling it a 'powerful' story. Another person commented: 'Thank heaven people are finally coming to their senses about breastfeeding. Women my age have put up with listening to this bunkum about the superiority of breast feeding for 40 years and it's really getting old.' And a third commenter agreed: 'Thank you for this article. I too am sick of the lactivists pushing their agenda down everyone's throat. Why the HELL is it any of their business?'","Emily Wax-Thibodeaux had a double mastectomy at the age of 32, which left her unable to breastfeed when baby Lincoln was born five years later ."
"Kylie Bretag has been locked up in a detention centre in Mexico since October 20 . An Australian woman who was on 'the trip of a lifetime' to celebrate her birthday and graduation, has been locked up in a Mexican detention centre. Kylie Bretag has been kept in appalling conditions at the detention centre in Tenosique, a small Mexican town north of Guatemala, for the last six days and has no set date for her release. The 30-year-old from Melbourne was arrested by Mexican officials while passing a checkpoint on a bus on October 20 after she was caught travelling in the country without a visa. Natalie Wayt, Ms Bretag's close friend who was on her way to meet the recent graduate in Cancun before she was locked up, told Daily Mail Australia that Ms Bretag had crossed the border between San Diego and Mexico on foot in order to save money. 'Some travel websites says that if you want to save money go to San Diego and walk the border. 'It's actually very common, people from the US do it all the time. They just go down there and have lunch and then come back,' Ms Wayt said . Scroll down for video .

Ms Wayt said her friend had crossed the border from San Diego to Mexico on foot after hearing that it was cheaper than flying online. She was then arrested while on a bus in Tenosique, north of Guatemala . 'She even asked an official down there, because she had her passport in her hand, she asked him where she could get it stamped and he didn't say anything, just waved her on. There was a massive language barrier. 'She's committed a crime, but the punishment for it is deportation and she hasn't been deported yet. All she wants to do is go home.' Until now, Ms Bretag had been keeping in contact with Ms Wayt and her family at home via a mobile phone. As of Sunday morning Australian time, the phone – her only way of contacting the outside world - was removed from her possession. Ms Bretag was on 'the trip of a lifetime' to celebrate both her 30th birthday and graduation from her communications degree . Ms Wayt said her friend had asked an official to stamp her passport when entering the country but, 'he didn't say anything, just waved her on' 'She told me: ""I just want to go home, I'm living a nightmare"",' Ms Wayt said. Both her mother Colleen and Ms Wayt said staff at the detention centre continue to promise Ms Bretag that she will be deported and relocated on certain dates, and yet she continues to be held in Tenosique. 'We've been liaising with the Mexican consulate often, but they just say to us ""she's going on such and such day"" and that just hasn't happened. We're just waiting, waiting, waiting,' Colleen said. The most recently set date for her departure is in two days' time but neither her family nor friends are convinced by the empty promises. There is no set date for her release of relocation as centre staff continue to make 'broken promises' Ms Bretag is being kept in a crowded cell with up to 20 other women, no clean water to bathe with and is sleeping on a thin mat on the floor . 'There's no bus ticket, no plane ticket – that's just what the consultant has been told. I'd like to think that she will be leaving on Monday but I don't know what to believe any more,' Ms Wayt said. In the meantime, Ms Bretag is being held in appalling conditions alongside more than 20 other women and dozens of children. Sleeping on one of the numerous small mats that line the ground in a row on the floor, Ms Bretag told her friend that she is yet to bathe in the facility as she has no privacy and the shower 'is a box with a hole in it' with the water being supplied in buckets filled with recycled water from the sinks. 'But today was good,' Colleen said, 'because she managed to be let outside for 5 minutes'. 'We just all feel sick and really worried about not being able to communicate with her – but all we could say was 'we love you and stay calm'. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is believd to be providing consular assistance Ms Bretag, according to The Age.

"A Florida veterinary technician has been arrested and charged with practicing medicine without a license after he allegedly gave his sick girlfriend a drug meant for her dog. Cedrik Claude Merlet, 40, from Bradenton, was taken into custody Tuesday in connection to an incident that took place back in February. According to the Manatee County Sheriff's Office, Mr Merlet, a veterinary Emergency technician at a Bradenton clinic, hooked up his girlfriend to an IV during what he believed was an asthma attack. Dog lover: Cedrik Merlet (left and right), 40, from Bradenton, Florida, has been charged with practicing medicine without license for giving his girlfriend a drug meant for her dog . For man and beast: Dexamethasone sodium phosphate can be prescribed to human patients suffering from severe allergic reactions, arthritis, blood disease , internal, eye and skin disorders . Sheriff's deputies responded to Merlet's home in Bradenton just after midnight February 1 after receiving a report about a domestic incident. The officers noted that the 40-year-old man smelled of alcohol and had slightly glassy and bloodshot eyes, according to Miami Herald. Merlet, a French national, told the deputies that his girlfriend got extremely drunk during an alcohol-fueled party and began throwing up. Merlet, who had worked as a paramedic in New Jersey before moving to Florida in 2006, apparently came to the conclusion that the woman was having an acute asthma attack. In an effort to help her, the veterinary technician injected saline into his girlfriend, according to officials. Merlet admitted to the deputies that he administered 2 milligrams of dexamethasone sodium phosphate, which was left over from a prescription for the girlfriend’s dog. The drug is a corticosteroid used to treat a wide variety of inflammatory conditions in cats and dogs, as well as certain cancers and Addison’s disease. Medical emergency: Merlet told deputies that his girlfriend got drunk and began throwing up during a party, leading him to inject her with a corticosteroid used to treat inflammatory conditions in cats and dogs . A version of the drug can also be prescribed to human patients suffering from severe allergic reactions, arthritis, blood disease , internal, eye and skin disorders, as well as breathing problems. Merlet's girlfriend, who is not being named, has told sheriff's investigators she only vaguely remembered being injected with something. According to deputies, Mr Merlet did not seek medical help for his girlfriend and failed to mention that he injected her with a corticosteroid when he called 911 to report a domestic incident. Merlet, who has a young son, was arrested Tuesday morning and taken to Manatee County Jail. He was released the same day without a bond. First responder: Merlet, a native of France with a military experience, worked as a paramedic after emigrating to the US . According to his profile on the website of his employer, Veterinary Emergency Center in Bradenton, Merlet is a native of France, where he served in the military and graduated from college with a bachelor’s' degree in biology before emigrating to the US. After settling in NJ, Merlet worked as a rescue diver paramedic and the as a first responder for the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management.","Cedrik Merlet, 40, from Bradenton, Florida, charged with practicing medicine without license .

"Leaked emails have added further weight to claims three Norfolk schools knew about visits by Ofsted inspectors days, and even weeks in advance. The academies involved - Ormiston Victory Academy in Norwich, Thetford Academy and Great Yarmouth Primary - are all linked to Dame Rachel De Souza. Ms De Souza was principal at the Norwich school and is the chief executive of the Inspiration Trust which runs the academies in Thetford and Great Yarmouth. Leaked emails have added further weight to claims three Norfolk schools knew about visits by Ofsted inspectors days, and even weeks in advance - the schools were linked to Dame Rachel De Souza . By law, schools can only be given half a day's notice of an inspection, but in August it was claimed the schools knew days, sometimes even weeks, before inspectors were due to visit. At the time Ms De Souza had moved from being the headteacher at Ormiston Victory school to the trust. She had also been made a dame for services to education and was a part-time Ofsted inspector. Sir Robert Bosher, national director for quality and inspection training at Ofsted, looked into the tip-off claims and concluded the schools could merely have guessed the dates of inspections. But leaked emails seen by The Observer show Ms De Souza saw an inspection schedule for one of the schools and was in a position to discuss the timing of visits with Ofsted. In a group email sent more than three weeks before inspectors visited Ormiston Victory Academy on May 14 and 15, 2013, Ms De Souza wrote: 'Only three weeks or so till Ofsted due at Victory too! Let's keep focused.' Ms De Souza was principal of the Ormiston Victory Academy and is believed to have found out in advance about an inspection there by Ofsted, and requested for the school website and honour role to be updated . The Tetford Academy was also caught up in the tip-up claims investigated by Ofsted . According to the emails, Ms De Souza appears to have acted on prior knowledge in the days before a visit to Ormiston Victory. She had requested that the school's website be updated - 'inspectors will probably look Monday', and that their roll of honour be 'sorted' as it looked 'sparse on the wall'. At Great Yarmouth Primary Academy, where Ms De Souza was chair of governors, Mr Bosher's investigation conceded she was 'mistakenly given sight of a schedule' that included the planned inspection date for the school. The information was provided to her during her training to become a Ofsted inspector. Mr Bosher said there was no evidence that Ms De Souza had passed the information on. The inspection date was then changed, from May 7 and 8 to May 13 and 14, but the school's principal, Bill Holledge, however, turned down an offer from David Cameron to attend a Downing Street function on May 12. According to the emails, three weeks before those inspections Ms De Souza informed her secretary: '14 and 15th May – please do not add any further appointments – I am expecting a late notice very important event on or around those days.' MailOnline was unable to reach Ms De Souza for comment.","Claims school's had advanced notice of Ofsted inspections .

"Swingers on the hunt for excitement are spreading sexually transmitted infections by taking part in drug-fuelled orgies, new research claims. A Dutch study found almost half of older swingers admitted taking illegal substances to boost their prowess in the bedroom and keep multiple partners satisfied. As well as erectile dysfunction drugs such as Viagra, they are also using cocaine, ecstasy (MDMA), GHB, laughing gas, cannabis, poppers, speed, LSD and lysergic acid to help them perform - at levels similar to gay men. Scroll down for video . Researchers found 13 per cent of swingers - with an average age of 45 - had chlamydia or gonorrhoea . However, their unsafe sexual practices are putting them at increasing risk of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B, experts warn. The researchers, writing in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, say swingers should be targeted with the same health advice as other at-risk groups. These people are known to engage in high risk sexual behaviour such as having multiple sexual partners, group sex, and unprotected sex, but there is little data on their use of drugs and what impact that has. Over-45s have previously been found to wrongly believe they had a low risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection (STI). But there is little data on swingers who have recently been classified as an emerging high risk group for STIs. The researchers therefore set out to assess the prevalence of drug use among swingers and its link with high-risk sexual behaviour and STIs. In the first study of its kind, they studied 289 men and women with an average age 49. These people said they were swingers and had visited a STI clinic from 2009 to 2012 in South Limburg, The Netherlands. For the study, they filled out a questionnaire on their sexual and drug use behaviour while swinging, over the preceding six months. The researchers then looked for a link between sexual behaviour, drug use and STI diagnoses including chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B. More than three quarters of swingers reported recreational drug use - including alcohol, Viagra (pictured) and illegal drugs . They found 13 per cent of patients - with an average age of 45 - had chlamydia or gonorrhoea - similar to the rates among gay men and young people. Dr Laura Spauwen, of South Limburg Public Health Service in Geleen, The Netherlands, said: 'High-risk sexual behaviours are common among swingers. 'By definition, swingers are also involved in concurrent sex as they have overlapping partnerships over a fixed period of time.' More than three quarters of swingers reported recreational drug use - including alcohol and use of Viagra. Drugs were also frequently used in combination - especially the combination of GHB and MDMA. In men, a combination of MDMA and erectile dysfunction drugs was frequently seen in men. 'Since swingers are involved in lengthy sexual acts with multiple partners,  male swingers use erectile dysfunction drugs to maintain while using other drugs,' explained Dr Spauwen. She noted eight per cent of the women reported recreational use of Viagra, for which the effects are unknown. The results also showed that a quarter of the male participants had been with male swing partners in the last six months. And more than half of those surveyed - both men and women - had group sex in the same period, with half of them not using condoms. Half reported having six or more sex partners over the preceding six months - and had not used a condom during vaginal sex. There was no differences in sexually risky behaviour between men and women . Dr Spauwen added: 'Swingers - at least those attending our clinic - are a generally older group. 'The prevalence of drug use observed among swingers in this study is very high and comparable with what is observed in men who have sex with men.' Half of swingers interviewed reported having six or more sexual partners over the preceding six months - and had not used a condom during sex .","Dutch study found half of older swingers admitted taking illegal substances .

"Italian police are investigating whether a hospital nurse could have killed up to 38 patients after she was accused of injecting one with a fatal dose of potassium. Daniela Poggiali was arrested by officers in Lugo, northern Italy, after the unexpected death of a 78-year-old patient who was admitted with a routine illness. Today they revealed they had widened their inquiry to include 38 deaths, including ten which have been described as 'very suspicious'. One report by the Central European news agency said she was accused of giving her patients high doses of potassium  because she found them or their families annoying. Scroll down for video . Accused: Police are investigating whether hospital nurse Daniela Poggiali (pictured) could have killed up to 38 patients in Lugo, northern Italy. Prosecutors said ten cases were 'very suspicious' - but would be hard to prove . A staff member said Poggiali asked to have her photo taken next to a patient who had just died, according to several reports including in the Italian newspaper Libero Quotidiano. Another reportedly accused the 42-year-old nurse of 'joking' about giving a high dose of potassium to a seriously ill patient. The inquiry was triggered by the death in April of 78-year-old Rosa Calderoni. Tests indicated the pensioner had unusual amounts of potassium chloride in her bloodstream - high doses of which can trigger cardiac arrest. It is used as part of the death penalty in the U.S. But prosecutors admit there are 'insurmountable difficulties' with their investigation because potassium fades from the bloodstream within a few days, making it hard to detect. Investigation: The hospital in the northern Italian town of Lugo (pictured) is at the centre of the probe . Chief prosecutor Alessandro Mancini told a press conference reported by Italian newspaper Il Resto Del Carlino: 'There are the other 38 cases of suspicious deaths and of these, ten are very suspicious. 'Investigations are continuing, but there are insurmountable difficulties'. He added Poggiali was 'unperturbed' when she was arrested in the last few days. In local reports, one nurse who worked with Poggiali described her as a 'cold person but always eager to work'. Another claimed Poggiali, who is being held on a murder charge, had once given powerful laxatives to patients towards the end of her shift to 'embarrass' colleagues working on the shift after her.","Daniela Poggiali, 42, has been arrested by police in Lugo, northern Italy .

"A couple whose dream Caribbean beach wedding and honeymoon turned into a ‘nightmare’ after seven people fell ill have won a £50,000 pay out from Thomas Cook. Terry and Keeley Ford travelled to the luxury Melia Caribe Tropical Resort in Punta Cana for what they planned would be a romantic, luxury two-week break. However, bride Keeley, 45, fell violently sick just hours after saying her marriage vows to her engineer husband, leaving her bed-bound for days. On their wedding day: Terry and Keeley Ford at Melia Caribe Tropical Resort in 2009 before falling ill . Four-star resort: The Melia Caribe Tropical Hotel in Playa Bavaro Punta Cana, Dominican Republic . Legal action: Keeley and Terry Ford pictured with a Thomas Cook brochure, and, left, the page of the resort . Another six members of the wedding party, including the 53-year-old groom, also fell ill from a bug which caused vomiting and diarrhoea. The couple, from Kings Heath, Birmingham, also endured a hurricane that caused flash flooding on the night of their £8,300 wedding at the all-inclusive resort in the Dominican Republic. According to the law firm Irwin Mitchell, Thomas Cook has paid £50,000 to the couple and their family after they launched legal action. Mum-of-two Keeley, a childminder, claimed almost raw food was served up at the four-star hotel and said the same utensils were used for uncooked and cooked meat during their stay in August 2009. Nightmare holiday: Terry and Keeley Ford on the beach of the luxury Melia Caribe Tropical Resort in Punta Cana . Before the illness: The happy couple are pictured with their family members on their wedding day in 2009 . ‘Terry and I have both been married before so did not want the fuss of a church wedding so we decided to go somewhere hot instead,’ she said. ‘I was concerned about some of the food which was being served in the restaurant. I remember eating a burger and the middle was pink and did not seem to be cooked properly, so I sent it back to the kitchen.’ The couple said their holiday turned into a nightmare when Terry’s 21-year-old son fell ill before the wedding – and the rest were ill within two days of the celebrations. Keeley’s father, Anthony, who had previously suffered from bowel cancer, was diagnosed with gastroenteritis on his return and needed time off work. Compensation: Terry and Keeley Ford have won a £50,000 pay out from Thomas Cook after their wedding turned into a 'nightmare' Keeley also fell ill along with her two children who were 11 and 15 at the time, and her parents.Things went from bad to worse, when a hurricane hit the island. Keeley said: ‘Terry's son, Jonathan, fell ill just two days after we arrived which made it hard for us to all be together as a family. ‘As we were finishing our meals on our wedding day, a hurricane hit which meant we all had to return to our rooms to take cover. ‘Of course, this could never have been prevented but when we got up the next day the hotel was a complete mess, yet the staff did not seem to be in a hurry to clean it up. ‘Over the following two days we all started to feel ill with each of us unable to leave our rooms for long because of sickness and diarrhoea. It was an absolute nightmare. ‘It was a wedding and a holiday we will remember for all the wrong reasons but we are relieved the legal battle has now ended and we can finally start to put the ordeal behind us.’ Clare Pearson a specialist travel lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing the family, said: ‘This trip, which was meant to be a wedding celebration as well as a holiday, was ruined because of the illness the wedding party suffered and unfortunately nothing can turn back the clock to change that. ‘Whilst the hurricane was unfortunate and could not have been predicted, holidaymakers’ welfare must be the top priority for tour operators at all times and efforts must be made to ensure that hotels are following good hygiene practices when it comes to food and cleanliness.’ Irwin Mitchell has previously secured a settlement for holidaymakers who travelled to the resort in 2007 and also suffered illness. A Thomas Cook UK & Ireland spokesman said: 'The health and safety of our customers is of paramount importance. 'We extend our apologies to Mr and Mrs Ford following their illness while staying at the Meliá Caribe Tropical Hotel in the Dominican Republic in 2009, and confirm that we have reached an agreement with their legal representatives. 'Thomas Cook closely audits all of the hotels to which it operates to ensure that only the very highest health and hygiene standards are in place. 'We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, as we work closely with all our hotel partners to ensure that only the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.'","Terry and Keeley Ford paid £8,300 for all-inclusive wedding and honeymoon .

"Indefinitely: University of Georgia star tailback Todd Gurley was suspended from competition indefinitely by the university Thursday pending an investigation into whether he violated NCAA rules . University of Georgia star tailback Todd Gurley was suspended from competition indefinitely by the university Thursday pending an investigation into whether he violated NCAA rules, officials report. Officials say that the violation involved Gurley receiving 'extra benefits' for memorabilia, autographs, or the 'use of his likeness'. In a university press release posted Thursday, school officials failed to give specifics on the alleged violation but said that there is an 'ongoing investigation into an alleged violation of NCAA rules.' 'I'm obviously very disappointed,' UGA head football coach Mark Richt said in the press release. 'The important thing for our team is to turn all our attention toward preparation for Missouri.' The Heisman Trophy candidate reportedly received $400 to sign 80 items in Athens, Georgia this past spring, Sports Illustrated reports. ESPN reports that noted autograph authentication company James Spence Authentication has authenticated at least 500 items signed by the UGA junior. This includes jerseys, mini-helmets, photos, baseballs and Nike cleats. SB Nation posted an alleged email from a 'tipster' saying he has video- and photo-evidence of Gurley doing a private autograph signing. The tipster said he has sold Gurley-signed memorabilia on ebay. Scroll down for video . Tweets: Sports experts like Darren Rovell and Bruce Feldman have taken to Twitter to comment on Gurley's alleged NCAA violation . Games: While Gurley's relationship with memorabilia dealers is investigated, the tailback is expected to miss two to three games . The tipster claimed that Gurley has been paid thousands of dollars, however, the video reportedly fails to show an exchange of money and the photograph does not clearly show Gurley. The tipster said in the email: 'I believe this would be the lead story on sports center if ESPN got their hands on this. Hope to hear from you soon.' The NCAA prohibits student-athletes from receiving 'extra benefits.' The NCAA describes extra benefits as: 'any special arrangement by an institutional employee or a representative of the institution's athletics interests to provide a student-athlete of the student-athlete's relative or friend a benefit that is not expressly authorized by NCAA legislation.' Paid: Officials say that Gurley received $400 for signing memorabilia on the UGA campus this past spring . ESPN reports that this specific kind of violation is not new to the world of college football. Other violators have included A.J. Green, who now plays for the Cincinnati Bengals and Johnny Manziel who now plays for the Cleveland Browns. While Gurley's relationship with memorabilia dealers is investigated, the tailback is expected to miss two to three games, Fox Sports reports. This means that Gurley may miss games being played against the Missouri Tigers, the Arkansas Razorbacks, and, long-time rivals, the Florida Gators. ESPN reports that coaches found out Thursday that Gurley would not be permitted to play against Missouri -- the game is scheduled for Saturday. Freshman Nick Chubb is said to be a likely candidate to take Gurley's place in the game against the Missouri Tigers.

"Killed: Former mechanic Ross Waters (pictured) led police in a 110mph chase along two motorways . A father-to-be was killed as he ran across a motorway after telling his fiancée 'it ends tonight' during a 110mph police chase, an inquest heard. Former mechanic Ross Waters, 33, sparked the 30-mile pursuit after a heated row with two friends at the home he shared with Laura Swarbrick in Blackpool, Lancashire. He tried to follow them home and rammed their car outside a police station before escaping onto the motorway, evading tyre spikes and a police roadblock before continuing, fatally, on foot. An inquest in Preston, Lancashire, heard Mr Waters had been suffering the effects of a devastating brain injury he had received in a 2004 car crash. The incident had left him unable to remember his family, where he lived or what he liked to eat. After he met Ms Swarbrick they moved in together in Blackpool. She fell pregnant with his child, and they were due to marry. But on November 10 last year, events took a fatal turn after Mr Waters had a row with his fiancée's visiting friend Carl Noblet and his wife Tammy. The couple left to go home at around 8.30pm and spotted Mr Waters tailgating them in his Ford Focus Sport, they told the inquest. Mr Noblet said: 'At first it was close enough that I couldn’t see its headlights. Obviously when a car is that close it’s a little weird. 'I didn’t know who it was. Then the car backed off enough to see the number plate and it was Ross Waters’ car. 'When I realised it was him I decided to keep driving and not go to my home because I wanted to avoid confrontation. I travelled around for a while and he continued to follow.' Mrs Noblet then received a warning text message from Mr Waters' fiancée. 'It said ""Ross is in the car behind you. He is threatening to ram you off the road.""', Mr Noblet said. 'I told Tammy to phone 999 and then we went to the police station, but he drove into the rear driver’s side of my car.' Pleading: Fiancée Laura Swarbrick (left arriving at the inquest) told the hearing she spoke to Mr Waters (right) 'the whole time' on the phone. She added: 'He kept repeating ""it ends tonight,"" ""enough is enough""' Fatal night: How the chase unfolded, first within Blackpool and then for 30 miles down the M55 and the M6 . Mr Noblet jumped out of his car in a bid to restrain Mr Waters, but the passenger door was locked - prompting the former mechanic to try and mow down Mr Noblet's wife. She was thrown onto the bonnet as Mr Waters continued driving, and only rolled off when he turned right at a junction. Mrs Noblet told the inquest jury: 'I stopped and screamed to Carl to get the kids. I heard an engine and lights and that is all I remember apart from screaming. 'I remember seeing his face when I was on the bonnet. I was looking at him and still on the phone to the police. But when I came off the car it’s a daze.' Officers inside the nearby South Shore police station heard the commotion and gave chase, scrambling the force helicopter. Danger: Mr Waters' mother Heather (left) told the inquest her son suffered a devastating brain injury in 2004 which left him unable to remember his family. PC Gary Holliday (right) was almost hit in the motorway chase . They tried to stop Mr Waters as he returned home but he escaped - jumping a red light before driving onto the M55 and then the M6 towards Wigan. For the entire chase he was on the phone to his fiancée, who said he was 'very agitated' and 'worked-up'. She told the inquest: 'I was trying to diffuse the situation and was on the phone to him whole time - even when he hit Tammy. I heard the screams from Tammy. 'He was saying that he knew he was in trouble, ""enough was enough"" and he could not handle prison. 'I said I would wait for him if he went to prison. After that was a running commentary of speed, what he had done and what he was doing. Ms Swarbrick told the inquest: 'He was screaming. I was screaming. I had been begging him to stop' 'I know Ross, he would just disappear and deal with his anger in a sense. For him it could have been in any forms. Because of the argument which occurred I just though he was disappearing. 'I took [the argument] to be about our relationship. He knew he was in trouble. He was screaming. I was screaming.” 'He kept repeating ""it ends tonight,"" ""enough is enough."" I had been begging him to stop.' Police tried to lay tyre spikes in the carriageway but Mr Waters veered across two lanes to avoid them, running over traffic cones and driving at motorway patrol officer Gary Holliday. 'I heard an extremely loud bang,' PC Holliday said. 'My partner was screaming at me to get out of the way. 'We were showered with debris. I ran back toward the police car. I described the sensation as standing on a platform when a very fast train comes past.' PC Glen Hilton added: 'It passed within a second of Gary clearing the carriageway. I said to Gary: ""I think he has just tried to kill you.""' Officers then tried in vain to stop Mr Waters using a rolling block involving several patrol cars. But when one patrol car pulled out in front, Mr Waters clipped the back of it - sending the car careering into a field. Sgt Tracey Ward, who was in the car, said: 'We felt we were airborne for what felt like ages but probably only a few seconds. At that point I didn’t know whether we were going to die or not.' By this point his car was left with just three fully working wheels, and one bare metal rim. Police pulled back and allowed the force helicopter to track the Focus, which Mr Waters eventually stopped near the M6 Charnock Richard services, just north of Wigan. He tried to run across all six lanes of traffic - but was fatally hit by a passing Mitsubishi 4x4 on the opposite carriageway. He suffered multiple injuries and died instantly, the inquest heard. His final words to his fiancée were: 'I have stopped. Are you happy?' The inquest continues.

"When going on a holiday many of us fear the inconvenience of having to claim lost items, missing luggage or even delayed flights - but what about having your finger bitten off by a rhino? Seasonal travellers often forget that unusual circumstances can happen while on an overseas holiday, with a number of extraordinary insurance claims making their way to Australian insurance companies in recent times.

'Who would ever think they would get their finger bitten off by a rhino at a zoo or be involved in a motorcycle accident while on a holiday with your secret boyfriend, who your husband wasn't aware of? - Now that is pretty weird,' she said. Good karma backfires: A volunteer helping animals at a zoo had his finger bitten off by a rhino . Other unusual claims have seen an Australian man attending a Burning Man festival in the United States who accidentally set his beard alight while trying to help a fire-breather, another man mistaking his foot for marine life while spear-fishing and also a young male falling from his hotel balcony after attempting to throw a cheese burger to his friend, Allianz Travel Assistance reports. Ms Campbell said that claims are reviewed by analyst specialists who are trained at investigating the level of care that would have been taken during the incident. They determine whether the person was at fault or if it was out of their hands. 'The cheeseburger claim came from an Australian guy holidaying in New Zealand - you don't think that those things happen on holiday but we found out that the balcony was actually never fixed correctly so it was a legitimate claim. 'He was running at full force and threw a cheeseburger to a friend on an adjacent balcony - he flipped and fell. 'The balcony didn't provide enough assistance and the accident impeded on his holiday experience,' Ms Campbell said. She said that unusual claims tend to be made more frequently during the June/July winter period when people go skiing or during Christmas time when Australians opt to take longer holidays. 'As the busier travel periods come around we tend to see more of these unusual claims come up.' Aside from those unusual and unlucky medical claims, Ms Campbell said the whole lost luggage saga is still a very common claim made by Australian travellers. Losing your luggage is one thing, but losing your luggage as a bride is a whole other story. Hipster horror: An Aussie attending the Burning Man festival tried to help a fire-breathing hipster when he accidentally set his beard alight . 'We have had a claim from an Australian bride getting married in Bali - she arrived at the hotel and left her wedding dress and shoe bag in the foyer. 'It had her garter,her wedding ring, her husband’s wedding ring, her dress and shoes in the bag - the hotel concierge slung that bag over another bag that was taken by another guest - it was never returned. 'That was extremely stressful for the bride, she had to go out locally to buy another dress and we paid her out.' Ms Campbell said that no two cases are ever the same but assisting travellers and making sure they are safe is always a number one priority. 'In the first phone call we have to make sure they are in a safe situation and can be moved safely - people call us very quickly you'd be surprised. 'We advise them to immediately seek medical care and make sure they go to a facility for an assessment.' She said Australians are very fortunate to have the highest level of medical care available. Travellers often opt for the cheapest insurance policy and forget that extraordinary things do happen while on the other side of the world. 'In the excitement of booking holidays people may not spend an appropriate amount of time assessing what their insurance covers them for. 'People need to think, ""well if I want to have that open ended experience and pick up those different tours and opportunities then I should make sure I am legally able to claim fully in case something happens"""", Ms Campbell said. Food for thought: An Aussie man was throwing a cheeseburger to his friend across a balcony when he slipped and fell over the edge .","Unusual claims are being made by Australians travelling overseas .

"Family doctors are failing to spot lung cancer until it is too late - with a third of patients diagnosed with the condition just 90 days before death. File picture . Family doctors are failing to spot lung cancer until it is too late - with a third of patients diagnosed with the condition just 90 days before death. And for one in 20 people with lung cancer, researchers discovered the disease is discovered only after they have died. Even when patients had visited their GP repeatedly in the months before their death, lung cancer had often gone unnoticed. GPs are often confusing the signs of cancer with maladies such as a smoker’s cough and failing to commission an x-ray. The findings show that GPs are not picking up signs of the cancer early enough in many cases, the researchers said. More than 35,000 people die of lung cancer in Britain each year, with just 9 per cent surviving for more than five years with the disease. Respiratory physician Dr Emma O’Dowd, who led the research at Nottingham University, found that those who died within three months had seen their GP an average five times before they finally received a diagnosis. Her team analysed a sample 20,140 cases of lung cancer seen at 440 GP surgeries between 2000 and 2013. Their research, published in the BMJ journal Thorax, established that 30 per cent of lung cancer patients died within three months of a diagnosis. Just over 10 per cent died within a month of being told they had the disease. And for 5 per cent, there was no record of lung cancer except on the death certificate, indicating the victim never knew why they were dying. Dr O’Dowd said the research disproves the idea that only those who neglect to visit their GP receive a late diagnosis. She said: ‘We’re losing a lot of patients early on. I wanted to find out more about these patients who died early and if there are features that can help us to diagnose them earlier. Scroll down for video . ‘I started off with the preconception that people who died early didn’t ever see their GP. Actually, they saw their GPs more before diagnosis compared to those patients who lived longer. ‘That was a surprising finding but obviously with this piece of work we can see specifically what symptoms they have come in with.’ She found that the odds of an early death were lower among those who had received a chest X-ray. Official NHS guidelines from NICE - the Government’s health advisory body - suggest that any patient who has a cough or hoarseness for three weeks should be sent for an urgent X-ray. GPs are often confusing the signs of cancer with maladies such as a smoker’s cough and failing to commission an x-ray. File picture . But because many of those who have lung cancer are regular smokers, the symptoms may be mistaken for a smoker’s cough, meaning the GP does not take further action. Dr O’Dowd added that most GPs are only likely to see one new case of lung cancer a year, meaning they are not familiar with the signs of the disease. She said: ‘Lung cancer can be difficult for doctors to distinguish from other lung diseases so we need to give them some tools that will help identify a patient as high risk. ‘If we can diagnose patients at an earlier stage hopefully they can get curable treatment rather than palliative treatment which is what most patients are getting at the moment. ‘It’s not that we’re trying to blame the GPs but if we have tools to identify these high risk people earlier than we should put them to use.’ New software is being developed for doctors that would flag up the risk of lung cancer in patients by tracking their symptoms and lifestyle. In a linked editorial, Dr Michael Peake, consultant at Leicester’s Glenfield Hospital, wrote that the study showed there had been ‘missed opportunities for earlier referral’. Only 9 per cent of lung cancer patients in the UK live for five years after they receive a diagnosis, compared with 17 per cent in the US and 13 per cent across Europe as a whole. File picture . He added: ‘The number of excess deaths linked to deprivation is large and the gap between the least and most deprived has not lessened over time. ‘Improved targeting of public awareness campaigns to specific social groups is important so as not to widen this gap further.’ GP representatives last night tried to deflect criticism from their members, insisting that better equipment is needed. Dr Richard Roope of the Royal College of General Practitioners said: ‘Lung cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose in primary care, especially as a key symptom is coughing, which is present with numerous other conditions that GPs see every day. ‘A full-time GP will usually see only one new case of lung cancer every year. ‘GPs are doing a good job of appropriately referring our patients that we suspect of having cancer and 75 per cent of patients found to have cancer are referred after only one or two GP consultations. ‘Taking into account the global picture, GPs across the UK are doing very well considering the meagre resources available to us. 'Funding for general practice is at an all-time low, we have a chronic shortage of doctors, and access to CT scanners, that would help in the diagnosis of lung cancer, is very limited in UK primary care. ‘Instead of criticising GPs, we need to invest in general practice to allow us to employ more GPs and support staff and to give GPs more access to technology that could ultimately save our patients’ lives.’ Only 9 per cent of lung cancer patients in the UK live for five years after they receive a diagnosis, compared with 17 per cent in the US and 13 per cent across Europe as a whole. Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said a lung cancer patient in Britain will not survive as long as they do in other countries. She said: ‘The finding that one in three UK lung cancer patients dies within three months of diagnosis is sadly a very telling consequence of late presentation and delayed diagnosis. ‘These are major reasons why lung cancer continues to be the biggest cancer killer in the UK, and why survival rates in this country lag behind those throughout Europe and the US. ‘Evidence suggests that well-funded awareness campaigns are proving very successful in increasing earlier diagnosis. A continuation and expansion of such campaigns will be crucial if we are to significantly improve lung cancer survival. ‘Furthermore, it is no coincidence that survival rates have improved so much faster for diseases such as breast cancer, which has long received far greater research investment. It’s time we start seeing the same levels of investment into lung cancer research and stop treating it like the poor relation.’","The disease is only discovered after death in one in 20 cases .

"Spice Girl Melanie Chisholm  revealed she has banned her five-year-old daughter Scarlet from looking at pictures of Rihanna . She exposed more than her fair share of flesh during her days as a Spice Girl often favouring a crop top to flaunt her toned torso. But Melanie Chisholm yesterday revealed she has banned her five-year-old daughter Scarlet from looking at pictures of Rihanna because she thinks the pop star is too raunchy. Explaining her decision, the 40-year-old also urged female stars to show a little 'more dignity' and stop being so overtly sexual. Miss Chisholm, who was once better known as Sporty Spice, said: 'My five-year-old daughter loves Rihanna. 'But she has no idea what her idol looks like, because there is little footage of Rihanna that I'm happy for her to see. 'It's a shame that a talented, successful woman expresses herself in such an overtly sexual way. Not that we can boil the problem down to one female singer baring her flesh. 'We need to have a bigger conversation about society's obsession with celebrity. It's vulgar and narcissistic and I worry about how it affects young girls.' It is not the first time Rihanna, 26, has come under fire for her provocative and sexually suggestive image and her risqué outfits. Two years ago she was dropped by Nivea as her image was considered inappropriate for a family brand. Miss Chisholm along with former bandmates Victoria Beckham, Mel B, Emma Bunton and Geri Halliwell championed 'Girl Power' as a term of empowerment in the 1990s and turned themselves into multi-millionaires in the process. She said the problem did not 'boil down' to one female singer exposing her flesh. Scroll down for video . Rihanna, 26, has come under fire for her provocative and sexually suggestive image and her risqué outfits . Unlike some of today's acts, the Spice Girls 'weren't interested in pleasing men' and made music that sent a positive image to girls and women, she said. Speaking to the Radio Times, Miss Chisholm said: 'There are some great artists out there, but sometimes we could just do with a bit more dignity. 'We need female artists to be authentic. Of course, a 20-something woman has feelings and experiences that she wants to express - but you also have to be mindful of your responsibility to young fans.'

Miss Chisholm, who split from Thomas Starr in 2012, her partner of ten years and father of Scarlet,added: 'We need to have a bigger conversation about society's obsession with celebrity. It's vulgar and narcissistic and I worry about how it affects young girls.' The singer's comments come in the wake of growing concerns about sexual content in music videos, and with the launch of a pilot scheme to give raunchy videos shown online in the UK age ratings. Chart-topping Blurred Lines by Robin Thicke, which featured naked models dancing, was one of the most high profile videos to raise eyebrows last year. Artists such as Annie Lennox have condemned the 'pornographic' content of some material presented to younger fans. 'I'm all for freedom of expression, but this is clearly one step beyond, and it's clearly into the realm of porn,' Lennox has said.","Mel C urged female stars to show 'dignity' and stop being so overtly sexual .

"From Jack the Ripper to modern day murder mysteries, the nation is gripped by the ins and outs of major crime cases. But, with the gritty details of forensic examinations and police investigations often remaining out of the public eye, it's usually left to TV dramas such as CSI, Law and Order and Silent Witness to fill us in on what really happens behind closed doors. However, soon we will be able to get close to the experts who started it all, because a new exhibition featuring historic figures from the world of forensic medicine is set to launch - and it will feature never-before-seen case notes of autopsies as well as prototypical mug shots from the 19th Century. Never-seen-before handwritten autopsy index cards by notorious forensic pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury  will form part of the hotly-anticipated 'Forensics: the anatomy of crime' exhibition, which will run for four months at London's Wellcome Collection museum in 2015 . The exhibition, which examines the history, science and art of forensic medicine, will run from February until June and will feature an array of ancient artefacts and artwork including the first prototypes of mug shots, dating back to the 19th Century, by Alphonse Bertillon . Several artworks will also be on display, including this 18th Century watercolour showing the decomposition of a Japanese noble lady . The exhibition, called 'Forensics: the anatomy of crime', will even include a literal murder scene - the floor tiles on which a friend of Mexican artist Teresa Margolles was killed. Set to launch at London's Wellcome Collection museum next February, the exhibition examines the history, science and art of forensic medicine and will bring together all manner of macabre treasures, including artworks and artefacts dating back as far as the Middle Ages. Among the displays are intricate 18th century Japanese watercolours capturing the decay of a dead noblewoman, and prototypical mug shots from forensic pioneer Alphonse Bertillon alongside their 1970s identikit progeny. However, the most anticipated exhibits are likely to be a selection of never-before-seen case notes handwritten by notorious forensic pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury. The yellowing index cards document some of the 20,000 autopsies Sir Spilsbury performed during his career, which spanned some of the most gripping whodunnits of the early 20th century. His profile was such that the satirical journal Punch featured his portrait in a 1928 issue, on display in the exhibition, declaring: 'When arsenic has closed your eyes, this certain hope your corpse may rest in: Sir B will kindly analyse the contents of your large intestine.' Lucy Shanahan, curator of the Wellcome Collection exhibition said: 'I get the impression that perhaps it became a default to go to Spilsbury rather than anyone else. 'Whilst Spilsbury's reputation did become damaged towards the end of his career, I don't think that necessarily means that he got everything wrong. 'I think he probably just got a little bit too caught up in his own ego and then perhaps wasn't doing as much of a thorough job as he should have been. 'Judging by his workload, he probably had far too many cases.' Lucy Shanahan, the  exhibition's curator, studies The Hortus Sanitatis (Garden of Health) -  a book printed in 1491 by Jacob Meydenbach . The 15th Century botanical book, which was printed in Mainz in Southern Germany by Jakob Meydenbach, will be on display for all to see . Many suspect that Sir Spilsbury made serious blunders during his career, including in what was arguably his best known case - the trial of Dr Hawley Crippen. The American-born doctor was convicted at the Old Bailey in 1910 of poisoning his wife Cora following her disappearance, and sentence to be hanged. Investigators discovered human flesh in his cellar that Sir Spilsbury testified must have come from the missing Mrs Crippen, all but delivering Crippen to the gallows. But nearly 100 years later, U.S. scientists called the pathologist's findings into question, with DNA testing revealing the flesh had more than likely belonged to a man. Whether or not the gruesome find in Crippen's home did indeed belong to his late wife, Ms Shanahan - who has spent nearly three years poring over the documents in the forensics exhibition - does not believe an innocent man was hanged. '(Crippen) was definitely up to no good,' she said. Handwritten autopsy index cards document some of the 20,000 autopsies Sir Spilsbury performed during his career in the 20th Century . The autopsy notes will give visitors a never-before-seen insight into the world of forensic medicine dating back to the Middle Ages . The exhibition will give the public an insight into forensic medicine, which is normally divulged on TV in dramas such as CSI (above) The success of BBC drama Silent Witness (pictured) only highlights the appetite for murder mysteries and crime solving in Britain . 'He had a mistress, he had a reason to leave the country, so it must have been fairly serious. 'There are a lot of question marks that are left hanging, but I'm sure he wasn't squeaky clean.' Though Sir Spilsbury's notes on the Crippen case are not among the thousands owned by the Wellcome Collection, the forthcoming exhibition will feature press clippings and courtroom portraits from the trial. The public will also get a rare glimpse at lesser-known cases pursued by Sir Spilsbury, including that of young Helen Elphinston-Dalrymple, who died when she had dry shampoo applied at the Harrods hair salon in 1909. Ms Shanahan said there may well be whispers, hidden in the trove of terse post-mortem examination notes, of innocent men sent to their deaths thanks to Sir Spilsbury's testimony. 'It would be an interesting task for a present-day forensic pathologist to undertake if somebody had an interest in reassessing his work,' she said. 'We worked quite closely with a coroner at the beginning of the exhibition as a consultant, and I took him to see the Spilsbury cards. 'He was absolutely bowled over. A series of 18th Century watercolour  paintings will form part of the 'Forensics: the anatomy of crime' exhibition in London next year . The exhibition at Wellcome Collection – the museum of medical history and oddities in Euston Road, - runs from February 26 to June 21 . 'He'd read so much about them, heard so much about them in the field, but never actually seen them - so I'm sure there are a lot of people who would love to get their hands on them.' Ken Arnold, head of public programmes at Wellcome Collection, said the museum was looking forward to welcoming new visitors following its £17.5million expansion. He said: 'Forensics' reminds us of the human body's extraordinary capacity to leave traces beyond death and disappearance. 'This unsettling truth is the focus of an astonishing range of scientific enquiry and fertile territory for the cultural imagination. 'Challenging, affecting, at once familiar and disquieting, it's a perfect subject for Wellcome Collection to explore as it welcomes visitors to its new expanded spaces.'

"The Royal Mail is refusing to deliver post to a house after a postman claims he was bitten by one of the Queen's favourite dogs. The postman says he was attacked by a corgi belonging to homeowner Jean Parker, 75, who will now be forced to get a taxi to pick up her mail. But Mrs Parker is adamant her beloved pet would do no such thing. She is furious at the Royal Mail for witholding her post and wrongly accusing her corgi, Leo, who is a 'little gem'. A postman says he was attacked by Leo the corgi, who belongs to homeowner Jean Parker, 75. She now has to walk two miles to pick up her post from a delivery office . Mrs Parker said: said: 'Everybody loves him. The vet says he's a little gem. He's got a good reputation' Royal Mail said its postman required hospital treatment after being bitten but Mrs Parker, from Gosport, Hampshire, claims there wasn't a mark on him. She said: 'My dog was outside saying goodbye to my sister's carers, they love him. 'It was raining so I threw a towel over him to dry him off. I didn't hear the postman come in through the gate. 'Leo ran out and he didn't get near enough before I called him back. The postman then started to look at his leg saying the dog had bitten him. Upset: Mrs Parker said the Royal Mail decision is leaving her without important mail . 'He had shorts on and I looked and there was nothing there - no marks, scrapes or blood. 'Leo is ten years old and doesn't even have that many teeth any more. 'He is so friendly and doesn't bite. But even if he did he would only be able to gum you.' Mrs Parker said the Royal Mail decision is leaving her without important mail such as notice of hospital appointments. She saw the postman a few days later and approached him - only to be told she would not be getting any post. She said: 'It is very worrying that I am not getting post. 'I'm waiting for appointments from the hospital, for news of my sister who is unwell and for bills. I'm expecting mail from abroad with bad news in. 'No-one will talk to me or tell me happening. 'No-one can tell me anything and the depot won't even tell me the manager's name. 'They said they are investigating but I have not heard anything. 'They should not be holding on to it. People have paid for stamps in the belief it will be delivered.' She said that Leo, a rescue dog she got three years ago, would never harm the postman. She said: 'Everybody loves him. The vet says he's a little gem. He's got a good reputation. 'Why this maniac has decided to say this is beyond me. I am not going to say my dog has bitten him, when he did not.' Royal Mail confirmed Mrs Parker's post was being withheld while it is conducting an investigation into the matter. Corgis are an active and sociable breed. They love being where the action is and will play rough and tumble games with children. They make good companions for elderly people. The corgi learns quickly and as long as he knows what is expected of him he will oblige. However if left to his own devices he will get up to mischief - mainly chewing something. The corgi is a good house dog and will bark furiously at the door bell. Excessive barking should not be encouraged. The corgi is a 'big dog in a small body' and can become 'bossy' if not trained with a firm but gentle hand. A lot of new owners make the mistake of treating the Corgi as a toy breed. The Corgi has an IQ equivalent to a five-year-old and will test authority. The Queen has been fond of corgis since she was a small child and has owned more than 30 corgis she ascended to the throne.

"Nick Clegg today looks to his wife Miriam to help the Lib Dems in the 'fight of our lives' to stay in power. The Lib Dem leader admitted his party faces a tough battle to cling to office after the general election in May, but insisted he would set out red lines for entering a new coalition with either the Tories or Labour. Asked if he would rather get into bed with David Cameron or Ed Miliband in a new power-sharing deal, Mr Clegg joked 'it's Miriam every single time', as he was joined by his wife for a photo opportunity in a school. Scroll down for video . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg today looked to wife Miriam for support as he warned his party has the 'fight of our lives' to survive at the next election . The couple visited Castlehill Primary School in Glasgow to highlight Lib Dem polices on free school meals and childcare . The Lib Dem conference in Glasgow got underway with the party on just 6 per cent in the polls. However, Mr Clegg is adamant that he could yet hold the balance of power, if Labour and the Conservatives both fall short of an overall majority. Embarking on a whirlwind of TV and radio interviews, Mr Clegg attacked both other parties. He said both of the larger parties had veered away from the political centre ground since the last election, while Lib Dems wanted both a 'stronger economy and a fairer society'. Asked by Sky News whether he would rather 'get into bed' with Mr Cameron or Mr Miliband in a hung parliament, Mr Clegg insisted: 'Miriam, every single time, if you must put it that way.' The Cleggs are expected to make a joint appearance at a school today to promote Lib Dem policies on free school meals and childcare. The Lib Dem leader added: 'I really do think that if either Labour or the Conservatives were to run this country on their own again, the country would go backwards. It would go backwards economically under Labour, it would go backwards socially under Conservatives. 'I'm really pleased that we are the party saying that there's a more hopeful, positive vision of the future built around a simple old-fashioned liberal concept, which is opportunity for everybody.' The Cleggs tried their hand at making scones with the children, including measuring milk into a jug . Mr Clegg's visit came after a media blitz of TV and radio interviews, in which he argued the Lib Dems did not face wipeout in 2015 . Mr and Mrs Clegg were joined on the visit to the school by Business Minister Jo Swinson (right) Nigel Farage has faced claims a vote for UKIP makes a Labour government more likely . Voters who back UKIP at the next election risk 'going to bed with Nigel Farage and waking up with Ed Miliband', David Cameron warned last week . The Prime Minister said the next election would be a 'straight fight' between Labour and the Tories, and a vote for UKIP made it more likely that Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister in 2015. The PM warned voters toying with the idea of voting UKIP that they were really voting for Labour . He told the Conservative conference: ''Let's be clear. This is a straight fight. It doesn't matter whether Parliament is hung, drawn or quartered, there is only one real choice. 'The Conservatives or Labour. Me in Downing Street, or Ed Miliband in Downing Street. 'If you vote UKIP – that's really a vote for Labour.' He went on: 'Here's a thought: on 7th May you could go to bed with Nigel Farage, and wake up with Ed Miliband. I don't know about you but not one bit of that works for me. David Cameron warned that a vote for UKIP would make it easier for Labour to win the next election . He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'In the same way that Labour took a very sharp turn to the left, the Conservatives took a very sharp turn to the right. 'When I went into coalition with David Cameron, the Conservatives said they cared about the environment - they clearly don't. They wanted to protect civil liberties and human rights - they now want to trash them. 'And that they cared about the most vulnerable in society. And yet George Osborne said very clearly last week that their ambition if they were in government on their own is to only balance the books by making the working-age poor make additional sacrifices.' He said the Lib Dems were making clear 'that's not a vision we share'. Mr Clegg was also forced to deny there was a 'flat' atmosphere spirit at this year's conference. 'It's an incredibly lively atmosphere here. People are really up for it, they're really up for the fight. 'We know we've got the fight of our lives on our hands, but we're incredibly proud, as I say, of what we've done and actually people are really relishing getting out there to tell our side of the story on the campaign trail in the coming months.' He also revealed he would be reading his main conference speech from a script, and not attempting to memorise it, as Labour leader Ed Miliband tried, but forgot to mention the deficit. Mr Clegg said: 'I won't be doing the speech from memory. I think Ed Miliband has demonstrated the perils of doing that.' A major split has opened up between the Tories and Lib Dems over how £25billion can be raised to eradicate the deficit after the election. Last week Tory Chancellor George Osborne made clear it should come entirely from spending cuts, including £3billion from freezing benefits. But Mr Clegg has insisted some of the money should come from tax rises. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Our overall approach is that we want to maintain roughly what we have done in this government, which is that the bulk of the savings come from spending reductions, about 80 per cent but about 20 per cent come from tax increases.' On BBC Breakfast, Mr Clegg hinted that he would allow an in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU if he entered a new coalition with the Tories. 'We have said in law for the first time ever, if there is a change in the rules of the European Union, the so called treaties, powers are moved from Westminster and Whitehall to Brussels, there will be a referendum. 'I have gone even further than that, I have been saying for as long as I have been leader of this party, when that referendum takes place, the decision should be in or out. 'Our position is clear, there will be a referendum, we have guaranteed it in law, when the rules of the game change in the European Union and new things are asked of the United Kingdom and I believe that when that is held the question on the ballot paper should be in or out.' Appearing on Sky News Radio/IRN, Mr Clegg admitted to mistakes in the early days of the coalition, saying he disappeared into the 'boiler room' of government to make 'gory decisions' but failed to speak to the public about what he was doing. Mr Clegg admitted that the Lib Dems 'slightly lost our voice' in the first year or so of the coalition, as he disappeared into the 'boiler room' of government to take 'gory' decisions . In an attempt to differentiate the Lib dems from both parties, Mr Clegg launched attacks on the Tories on fairness and Labour on the economy . Mr Clegg insisted that despite being at just 6 per cent in the polls, the Lib Dems are not heading for disaster in 2015 . Asked what he would do differently if he found himself in a coalition administration again after next May's poll, Mr Clegg said: 'I think probably what we wouldn't need to do next time is what we had to do this time, which was, right at the beginning, I slightly disappeared into the boiler room of the Government to make sure we took all these difficult, gory and, frankly, unpopular decisions to pull the economy back from the brink where we found it and to prove to people that coalition government could work. 'I think we slightly lost our voice in the first year or so of the coalition Government and that probably was inevitable because we needed to show people that coalition government could work. 'I think now people are used to the idea that coalition is what it says on the tin - two parties with different identities - and I think we could be more relaxed about that openly from day one if we were to be in coalition again.' Mr Clegg dismissed suggestions that his party, which has slumped to as little as 6 per cent support in the polls, is heading for disaster in the 2015 election. 'I've literally lost count of the times, with the greatest respect, that I've been asked questions saying 'Oh, isn't it going to be a disaster? Aren't you going to be wiped out? Isn't it all going to be terrible?'. And every time we confound the sceptics and I genuinely think we will do so next year,' he said.","Lib Dem leader embarks on TV and radio media blitz at party conference .

"A wheelchair-bound Tracy Morgan was seen looking a little worse for wear on Wednesday as his fiancee and baby daughter accompanied him on yet another New York City doctor's visit. The 30 Rock star had no comment for reporters asking about Walmart's recent claims the funnyman should shoulder blame for the terrible injuries he sustained when a company truck smashed into his limo bus on the New Jersey Turnpike in June. Just the day before, however, Morgan expressed his outrage over the company's claims in a statement issued to the press and claims he may perform again. 'I can't believe Walmart is blaming me for an accident they caused,' he said. 'I'm fighting hard every day to get back.' Scroll down for video . Hanging in there: A wheelchair-bound Tracy Morgan was seen looking a little worse for wear on Wednesday as his fiancee and baby daughter accompanied him on yet another New York City doctor's visit . 'I can't believe Walmart is blaming me': Morgan had no comment Wednesday regarding his clash with Walmart but on Tuesday the funnyman fought back over their claims he's to blame for his own grievous injuries when a company truck collided with his limo bus on the New Jersey Turnpike . Permanent? Reports surfaced on Wednesday that Morgan may never walk without assistance again . The 30 Rock star's lawyer, Benedict Morelli, said 'The jury’s still out' on whether Morgan will ever be able to perform again. Doctors aren't even sure if the 45-year-old will ever walk again without assistance, says TMZ. 'The doctors don’t know the answer. I don’t know the answer,' he added, according to the New York Post's Page Six. Morgan's disbelief is no surprise. The crash that left him close to death also killed another passenger and injured several others. Morgan was left seriously injured after a Walmart truck slammed into his limo bus on the New Jersey Turnpike in June. His close friend James McNair was killed and two others were injured. The group are suing Walmart for negligence because it is believed that the truck driver, Kevin Roper, had been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the deadly collision. On Monday the company tried to dodge responsibility, saying Morgan and his friends are partly to blame for their injuries because they were not wearing seatbelts at the time of the crash. The former 30 Rock star said he felt like he had to respond publicly to Walmart's latest claim, adding that he and his friends did nothing wrong. Walmart is blaming comedian Tracy Morgan for the injuries he sustained in June when a Walmart truck slammed into his limo bus. His friend James McNair was also killed and two others were injured . Morgan and friend were returning from a comedy show in Delaware when the Walmart truck collided with their limo bus in June . Morgan's friend James McNair was killed in the crash while accompanying the 45-year-old former Saturday Night Live star back from a show in Delaware. Morgan spent several weeks in rehab with rib and leg injuries. Walmart Stores Inc., who are based in Bentonville, Arkansas, said in their Monday court filing that the passengers' injuries were caused by their 'failure to properly wear an appropriate available seatbelt restraint device,' which it says constitutes unreasonable conduct. If they had been wearing a restraint, Walmart argues that 'all or a portion of the injuries could have been diminished or minimized'. An attorney representing Morgan and the other plaintiffs has not commented. Walmart didn't respond to claims that their driver, Kevin Roper, hadn't slept in more than 24 hours before the crash. Morgan spent several weeks in rehab with rib and leg injuries. Pictured on the left using a walker in New York with his fianceé Megan Wollover (left) in July. Morgan's friend and fellow comedian James MacNair (right) was killed in the accident . The company did admit though that Morgan and his friends' injuries 'may have been caused by third parties over whom Walmart had no control'. After the deadly crash, Roper was charged with causing the accident. Investigators believe he was dozing off behind the wheel in the moments before the collision and didn't see the traffic ahead of him until it was too late. '[The] driver failed to observe slow-moving traffic ahead,' New Jersey State Police Sgt. First Class Gregory Williams said. 'He observed at the last minute -- just prior to impact -- the limo bus carrying Morgan and his party.' Truck driver Kevin Roper allegedly had been working for more than a day when the accident happened. Pictured in New Jersey court on June 11 .

"The family of a former small-town South Carolina mayor who authorities say was shot to death by a police officer he had complained about for aggressive behavior has been awarded $97 million in a federal wrongful death lawsuit. Bert Reeves was shot in the chest with a service revolver belonging to Officer Randall Price in May 2011, along a rural dirt road. Price, who has not been charged in the death, is no longer a police officer. Authorities have said Reeves had objected after Price arrested an employee of his construction business. Murdered: The family of a former South Carolina mayor Bert Reeves (pictured) who authorities say was shot to death by a police officer he had complained about for aggressive behavior has been awarded $97 million . Reeves' family sued and multiple media outlets reported the jury Wednesday awarded $7.5 million actual damages, $60 million punitive damages against the town of Cottageville and $30 million punitive damages against Price. The family had said in the lawsuit that the town should never have hired Price after his troubled employment history in different departments, including being fired. Family attorney Mullins McLeod told the jury that Price shot Reeves because the ex-mayor raised concerns about the officer's behavior . Reeves wanted Price gone and Price retaliated, McLeod said. 'You certainly should be able to complain about a cop without fear of being killed,' McLeod told the jury. Price's attorney, Lake Summers, said the ex-Cottageville mayor suffered from bipolar disorder and was enraged when he confronted the officer. Summers said Price fired in self-defense. He would not talk about the jury award. Though Price has not been charged in the death, McLeod said an investigation is ongoing. Investigators said it wasn't clear how the two ended up on the dirt road near the town's main thoroughfare where Reeves lived. In February 2010, the Post and Courier of Charleston reported that Price insisted that he had been victimized by vendettas in the small towns where he cycled through eight jobs in 11 years. Cottageville has several weeks to decide whether to appeal the decision.

"Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo in Central Western New South Wales, have named their new born female calf , Ajali - which translates to destiny in the East African Swahili language . The birth of a female Giraffe calf has  zoo keepers thrilled, as the number of Giraffes in the wild have decreased by 30 per cent in the past decade. Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo in Central Western New South Wales have named the new born calf , Ajali (pronounced A-jah-lee) - which translates to destiny in the East African Swahili language. On Sunday 19 October, keepers were ecstatic to welcome their newest addition to the Giraffe herd, joining another young male calf, Nkoski, who was born earlier this year in August. 'It is always nice to see youngsters on exhibit together and knowing that they have a companion close to their age,' said Anthony Dorrian, a Giraffe keeper at Taronga Western Plains Zoo. 'The calves are already starting to develop a relationship, as Nkosi is very curious about the new calf.' The 11-day-old Ajali has  been spotted bonding with her mother, Tuli, who had previously given birth to seven other Giraffes. 'She has a very nurturing nature towards her newborn,' Mr Dorrian said of the experience mother. Unlike Tuli, other Giraffes may typically reject their calf after birth. 'In the past we have had to hand raise a couple of Giraffes - especially if it's a first time mum, it is really confusing and they don't know what is going on, Mr Dorrian said. 'After giving birth they just walk away and leave the baby.' But luckily the spotted long-neck calf, Ajali, was instantly embraced by her mother and the Giraffe herd. 'The first day they are born the rest of the herd are really curious and all come over. 'We have 12 other Giraffes and they stuck their head out to have a look - it didn't take a long time for the calf [Ajali] to get used to them.' The majestic African animal has spent her first few days testing out her wobbly legs as she was photographed frolicking in the sun and nestling up to her protective mum. The majestic African calf has spent her first few days testing out her wobbly legs as she was photographed frolicking in the sun . The zoo keepers' excitement for their second calf this year comes as the number of Giraffes in the wild are significantly falling, leaving only 80,000 left in the world. Due to 'poaching for bush meat' and humans frequently invading their habitat, Mr Dorrian said 'eventually we will end up with smaller and smaller isolated pockets of giraffes.' 'Every birth for a species such as the Giraffe that is experiencing a decline in the wild population is important, as it helps to insure against extinction,' said Mr Dorrian.

"Former President Bill Clinton admonished the NFL on Wednesday for the way it 'diminished' domestic violence early on in the Ray Rice scandal and expressed skepticism over the former football star's claim that his abusive behavior toward his wife was a 'one-time incident.' 'God I hope that it works out alright for . . . I hope he really is OK, and he never does it again,' he said of Rice. 'Sometimes people don't, but it's rare. 'It will either happen again or it won't,' he later stated. Clinton discussed the sensitive issue while in conversation with CNN host Erin Burnett at his non-profit's annual meeting in New York. The 68-year-old philanthropist spoke about his own experience with domestic violence as a child and pushed for the National Football League to take violence against women seriously. In an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett today at the Clinton Global Initiative today, Bill Clinton said the NFL should decide the consequences for domestic violence 'based on the facts' and 'how serious it was' Clinton seemed skeptical that Ray Rice was a reformed abuser. 'Sometimes people don't' ever hit their partners again, Clinton said, 'but it's rare.' A family affair: Recently renamed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, the former president now runs his global non-profit with the help of his wife and daughter . 'No incident should be ignored,' Clinton said, 'because if you do that, it just gets progressively worse. 'Based on my experience, I think it's a mistake to ignore it,' he said. Clinton wouldn't say whether her thought there should be a zero tolerance policy for domestic violence in the NFL, but he did say 'there should be consequences for domestic abuse and every case they know about.' 'What the consequences should be should be determined by the facts,' he said, 'and of course how serious it was.' Clinton, who signed the Violence Against Women Act into law 20 years ago this month, has been open about his stepfather's abuse of his mother throughout his younger years. The former president credits a confrontation with his stepfather at age 14 for the cessation of the disturbances. 'I just broke down the door of their room one night when they were having an encounter and told him that I was bigger than him now, and there would never be any more of this while I was there,' Clinton told journalist Joe Klein, then of New York magazine, in a January 1992 interview. During his dialogue with Burnett at the Clinton Global Initiative gathering, Clinton drew on his intimate knowledge of spousal abuse while talking about Rice and domestic violence in general. Clinton said that 'anybody who's ever been in a domestic situation knows' that abuse 'happens all the time.' The incident with Rice and his then- fiancee and now wife, is just one of many instances of spousal abuse taking place in America, he said. 'And look, I'm not minimizing what happened on the elevator, I'm just telling you that anybody who's ever been in one of these situations has seen it over and over and over again,' Clinton added. 'So I think we need to try to figure out how to make something good happen out all of this,' Clinton said. The former Arkansas governor said society needs to realize that 'in real life there are people, good people, who lose their self control' and hit their spouses. Victims of abuse know that they should probably leave their partners 'because they can't help it, they're gonna do it over and over again,' Clinton said. 'But they could be helped,' he interjected. And that's why 'we need to offer early intervention' and the violence prevention hotline 'needs to be answered all the time.' 'We should be trying to help people get beyond this, and then if they can't, there should be consequences,' Clinton said, referring to the abusers. Speaking indirectly about Rice, Clinton said 'people who are rich and popular because of athletics or entertainment, or any other like that, they shouldn't be held to an impossible standard.' 'But they shouldn't be exempted from the general rule that we can't get away with abusing people because of [our] positions,' he noted. Furthermore, Clinton said that society shouldn't write off every football player in the NFL as a criminal because of the abusive behavior of their current and former teammates. Many of them are 'good husbands and good fathers,' he said. 'I think it's really important that people not judge the whole league based on this, and that we wait to see what happens in this case,' he said. Clinton also claimed in the interview that the concussions that football players receive on the field may lead to more domestic disputes. Researchers have warned in the wake of the Rice affair that no conclusive evidence exists to support that theory, however.","Clinton admonished the NFL for the way it 'diminished' domestic violence early on in the Ray Rice scandal .

"A firm has been fined after a worker was crushed to death by a three tonne steel container. Michael Wickstead was working at a factory in Oldham, Greater Manchester when he was struck by an object which was knocked onto him by two cranes which had collided. The 63-year-old, from Radcliffe, Bury, suffered fatal crush injuries as a result of the tragic incident in Chadderton. A firm has been fined £125,000 after a Michael Wickstead (pictured) was crushed to death by a three tonne steel container . The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) launched an investigation into what happened, on July 11, 2011, at Refinery Supplies Ltd. During the course of the probe it was discovered cranes had collided on several other occasions at the site on the Greengate Industrial Estate and they were prosecuted. Manchester Crown Court heard that Mr Wickstead had been involved in manufacturing the large steel container, which was used to hold molten lead or zinc, and had been resting on a stand with chains hanging down to it from an overhead crane. A colleague was using another crane on the same overhead rail to move another container when the cranes collided, knocking the one Mr Wickstead was working on off its stand. Michael was hit by a steel container which caused fatal crush injuries. The court was told Refinery Supplies should have had a clear working system in place to prevent workers from being injured by the cranes. This could have included fitting anti-collision devices to the cranes, or making sure there was a safe method in place to avoid the two cranes coming into contact with each other. Refinery Supplies Ltd, of Greenside Way, has now been ordered to pay a total of £125,000 for failing to do more to prevent the tragedy. Michael Wickstead was working at Refinery Supplies Ltd (pictured) in Oldham, Greater Manchester when he was struck by an object . The company was fined £90,000 and ordered to pay £35,000 in prosecution costs after pleading guilty to a breach of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. Speaking after the hearing, HSE Inspector Helen Jones said: 'Michael sadly lost his life because the safety standards of his employer fell well below the minimum legal standards. 'Refinery Supplies knew there was a risk of cranes colliding at the factory and, in fact, this had happened on several previous occasions without the same catastrophic result. 'However, the firm failed to take any action to make sure workers weren't put at risk of being injured. 'It's vital that manufacturers carefully consider the dangers facing their employees and then implement safety improvements. 'If Refinery Supplies had done this then Michael's tragic death could have been avoided.'","Michael Wickstead, 63, was working at Refinery Supplies Ltd in Oldham .

"A culture of box-ticking means the public sector is less ethical than private business, according to a survey . A culture of box-ticking means the public sector is less ethical than private business, a study says, with organisations such as the NHS encouraging staff to hit targets at the expense of what is right. Public sector bosses are far more likely to believe their employer is unethical than those working for limited companies, the survey of 2,500 managers by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) found. Only 7 per cent of plc bosses say their employer is ‘ethically poor’, compared with 13 per cent of public sector managers. Civil servants are also half as likely to say their employer has ‘excellent’ ethics – 20 per cent to 40 per cent. Almost a third of managers rate their organisation as mediocre or worse on ethics, with bosses in big organisations four times more likely than those in small firms to rate their workplace as ethically poor. Elisabeth Buggins, chairman of Birmingham Women’s NHS Foundation Trust, said in the report that strong hierarchies in the NHS mean staff are treated as children, so they are tempted to put obeying the rules ahead of patients’ needs. In an outspoken critique, she said: ‘If there are more rules, regulations and guidelines than anyone can remember, you stop people thinking for themselves. ‘People think that as long as they’ve ticked the boxes their bosses won’t criticise them. They focus on that and forget why they are actually there. ‘Even if what they are doing is not good for the patient, at least they can say that they’ve ticked that box and nobody can tell them off.’ She said demands on staff without increasing resources was ‘robbing staff of time to think’ and causing more anxiety, which made ‘objective ethical thinking more difficult’. Mrs Buggins, former chairman of the NHS West Midlands Strategic Health Authority, who gave evidence at the public inquiry into the Mid-Staffordshire scandal, added: ‘What worries me is that in a business where emotional vulnerability is part of what you’re dealing with every day, they make people so afraid they can’t think.’ Managers in big organisations were four times more likely than those in small firms to rate behaviour in their workplace as ethically poor, according to the study. The NHS is the UK’s biggest employer with more than one million staff. Elisabeth Buggins, chairman of Birmingham Women’s NHS Foundation Trust, said strong hierarchies in the NHS mean staff are treated as children, so they are tempted to put obeying the rules ahead of patients’ needs . Ann Francke, of the CMI, said: ‘The public sector is the bottom of the pile for bosses awarding their employer top marks for ethical behaviour. ‘This highlights a culture of obedience in organisations, with box-ticking and rule-following, which is more prevalent in public sector organisations. ‘There is a lot of pressure around cost-cutting and risk management to the extent that people no longer trust their own instincts over what is the right thing to do. ‘They feel unable to step up and be accountable for their own actions.’ In the NHS, she said, less ethical behaviour could be pretending to meet a target or spending less time with a patient in need in order to hit a target. She said: ‘We have got to go back to basics and say “we are here to save lives and make people well” rather than “I have to make sure no one is in the emergency room for more than 10 hours or that the bed capacity rate stays above 97 per cent”.’ The CMI chief executive called for people to focus on the ‘more human impact of their decisions’.","7% of plc bosses say employer is 'ethically poor'; it is 13% for public sector .

"Many new mothers turn to the Internet to answer questions or concerns about life with their newborn. Sleeping habits are, of course, top of the list of queries but general health worries and child development are also popular online search topics, according to a new study out today. The most common three questions googled by mothers are: 'How can I get my child to sleep more?', 'How to clear my baby's nose?' and 'How can I help a teething baby?'. Two thirds of new mothers questioned in a parenting survey described Google as their 'best friend' during the early stages of motherhood . Almost two thirds of the mothers questioned described Google as their 'best friend' during the early stages of motherhood. It also emerged that as many as 85 per cent of mothers felt they had no idea what they were doing after giving birth to their first child. And almost three quarters described having a baby as the 'biggest shock of their life'. The study of 2,000 mothers found that 82 per cent felt constantly worried about their child. And to put their mind at ease during their pregnancy and in the weeks and months after giving birth three quarters admitted to regularly turning to Google for answers to any questions or worries they had. Common questions include: 'How do I treat a baby's cold?', 'When should I wean my baby?', 'How much milk should my baby have?' and 'Is my baby's rash normal?'. Common online searches include: 'How do I treat a baby's cold?', 'When should I wean my baby?', 'How much milk should my baby have?' and 'Is my baby's rash normal?'. The list also included questions such as 'What is colic?', 'How and when to potty train my child?', and 'When should my child crawl or walk?'. As well as googling answers to their questions, the study also found 26 per cent of mothers have asked friends for advice on Facebook, while another 12 per cent have turned to Twitter. Just over half have browsed parenting sites for the answers they are looking for, with 19 per cent also posting their question on parenting forums. Researchers found for some the questions start immediately, with more than one in ten turning to Google on the day they found they were expecting. Another 17 per cent did so within a few days of a positive test result. One in twenty even searched the internet to answer a question they had on the day they gave birth. But 87 per cent of mothers found they worried less as time went on and they adjusted to becoming a mum. And eight in ten spent less time googling things and worrying with second or third children. A spokesperson for Cussons Mum&Me Voice of Mums, which commissioned the research, said: 'Becoming a mum is a massive life-changing event, and it's natural to feel unsure or apprehensive at times. 'The study results show that while mothers often feel like the only one in the world worrying about a particular thing, more often than not it's something really common that most mums will have experienced and asked for advice on. 'When you first bring your baby home, it can feel pretty daunting knowing you are responsible for this little person, who doesn't come with an instruction manual. 'This can be especially true when dealing with their first cold or illness. 'But every mum you know will have been there, so you don't need to feel alone about asking them for advice.'

"Police in Nevada have arrested a man suspected of tying a bowling ball to a dog and drowning it in a Northern California river. William Meek, 47, was on the run for nearly five months before police in Reno, Nevada finally tracked him down on Tuesday, The Sacramento Bee reports. Officials say the border collie was found floating in the American River in Sacramento on June 16. The dog had a leash on its collar that was tied to a bag containing a bowling ball and large rock. Horrific: William Meek (left) was arrested in Reno, Nevada five months after he allegedly drowned his girlfriend's 12-year-old border collie named Zelda (right). The girlfriend told authorities that she gave the animal to Meek to drop off at an animal shelter after the got bit someone . City animal care manager Gina Knepp says the dog had a microchip that officials traced to a Sacramento woman, who turned out to be Meek's girlfriend. The woman, who was remained unidentified, told authorities that she gave the 12-year-old dog named Zelda to Meeks to drop off at a shelter after the dog bit someone. Instead, Meeks took the dog to a stretch of the American River and drowned the poor animal. A necropsy revealed that there was water in Zelda's lungs and that the dog was alive and struggled to breathe in its last moments. The dog's carcass was found several days later by someone walking along the river. Meek is currently being held on charges of malicious maiming of animals and possession of a controlled substance. Arrest records show he has a history of using methamphetamine. Sacramento authorities are seeking Meek's extradition to California. It wasn't immediately known if he has a lawyer.","Williams Meek's girlfriend told him to take her dog to a shelter after it bit someone last June .

"Struggling restaurant chain Red Lobster is going back to its roots with a new menu that’s set to feature more dishes featuring lobster. A revamped menu announced on Monday removes several poorly received non-seafood dishes including Spicy Tortilla Soup and a Wood-Grilled Pork Chop. These non-seafood dishes had been added by the chain's previous owner, Darden Restaurants Inc., in the vain hope of attracting people who don't like seafood as sales declined. Scroll down for video . Red Lobster's new Wood-Grilled Lobster, Shrimp and Salmon dish: A revamped menu was announced on Monday that increases the amount of seafood on the menu to 85 percent, up from 75 percent . But the new management team thinks that was a mistake and has increased the amount of seafood on the menu to 85 percent, up from 75 percent. ‘At the end of the day, we believe that seafood is really why people come to Red Lobster,’ said Salli Setta, Red Lobster's president. Red Lobster says the menu will be easier to navigate and features more photos of the food. Four of the five new dishes include lobster, and it's increasing the amount of shrimp in the popular Ultimate Feast platter by 50 percent. The price of the dish, which also includes lobster and crab, will go up by a dollar to $26.99. The reversal comes after Red Lobster was sold off to investment firm Golden Gate Capital by Darden during the summer. The struggling restaurant chain is going back to its roots with a new menu that’s set to feature 10 percent more seafood . Darden, which is based in Orlando, Florida, and owns Olive Garden, had failed to turn around the chain's declining sales and blamed a variety of factors such as the growing availability of shrimp at other restaurants and price-sensitive customers. For its last fiscal year, Darden had said Red Lobster's sales declined 6 percent at established locations, following a 2.2 percent decline the previous year. Red Lobster, which is still operating out of Darden's offices until it moves into its new home, will no longer have to disclose its sales figures because it is privately held. Whether its new menu will win back customers remains to be seen, with people increasingly heading to chains like Chipotle where they feel they can get high-quality food without paying as much. Off the menu: Dishes removed from the latest Red Lobster menu include the poorly received Spicy Tortilla Soup, right, and the Wood-Grilled Pork Chop, left . Other changes had already been in the works. CEO Kim Lopdrup, who is back at Red Lobster after serving as its president from 2004 to 2011, has said steep discounting like ‘30 shrimp for $11.99’ was a mistake. The chain this summer also started changing the way it plates its dishes, with fish piled over rice instead of having foods spread out on a dish. Red Lobster says that presentation is more visually appealing, while also helping retain the food's heat.","After a failed attempt at trying to appeal to people who don't have seafood, Red Lobster has revamped its menu yet again .

Samantha Cousans, from Sheffield in South Yorkshire, was placed in a coma, her life hanging in the balance as sepsis ravaged her body causing the flesh in her legs to die. For 11 days the mother-of two, who had yet to meet her newborn daughter Megan Rose, fought the vicious condition. When she finally woke, Mrs Cousans was left paralysed after losing muscle function while lying in the medically induced coma. Today, against the odds, Mrs Cousans has made a full recovery, and is now enjoying looking after her two daughters, Olivia, five and Megan now 18 months. Samantha Cousans, 31, from Sheffield was struck down with life-threatening blood poisoning just days after giving birth to baby Megan Rose, now 18 months . The blood poisoning surging through her body caused necrosis - where the body's flesh dies due to lack of oxygen reaching the tissue . She was also left paralysed because her muscles wasted away from being in a coma for so long . Mrs Cousans said: 'After giving birth to Megan I was so excited to be at home, Olivia was so happy to have a baby sister and it should have been a wonderful time. 'But within days my health deteriorate rapidly. 'I felt sick all the time and was so weak - I couldn't even hold Megan as she felt so heavy in my arms. 'When I eventually went to hospital my family were told I might not make it through the night, it was that serious. 'When I came around after my coma I couldn't believe what was happening to me - and being paralysed was very scary. 'But my girls gave me the motivation to keep going and recover quickly, and my husband, Chris, was amazing. 'I'm so lucky - I was very close to losing my arms and legs - and even my life. 'I'm so glad I'm still here to be a mum for my girls.' Mrs Cousan's first daughter, Olivia Grace, had been a Caesarean, so when she went home she thought being exhausted and weak was usual after a normal birth . Mrs Cousans received five different skin graft operations and had physiotherapy to learn to walk again . Sepsis is a common but potentially life-threatening condition. It is triggered by an infection, and causes the body's immune system to go into overdrive. It causes widespread inflammation, swelling and blood clotting. It can lead to a significant fall in blood pressure, which can compromise blood flow to vital organs, including the heart, brain and kidneys. If not treated quickly, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death. Each year in the UK, it is estimated more than 100,000 people are admitted to hospital with sepsis and around 37,000 people die as a result of the condition. Early symptoms include: . In more severe cases a person is likely to suffer: . Source: NHS Choices . Mrs Cousans was suffering from sepsis, a life-threatening blood poisoning that kills 37,000 people in the UK each year. The poison was forcing her organs to fail and was causing necrosis - the death of body tissue - to her legs. Doctors put Mrs Cousans into a medically induced coma while they worked to drain her body of the poison that was killing her. She was left with scars and parts of her muscles missing because the poison prevented oxygen flowing to the tissue, killing the body's flesh. Mrs Cousans said: 'When I came around from the coma I knew something was wrong but I wasn't totally sure. 'It was a huge shock to realise I couldn't move. 'Because I'd been in a coma for so long I'd lost all the use of my muscles - I couldn't even move my fingers. 'It was horrible because I still hadn't held Megan properly, they just had to lie her next to me. 'I had to have five different skin graft operations on my legs too and then I had to learn to walk again. 'There was just so much to deal with.' Mrs Cousans first became ill the evening after Megan was born. She said: 'Megan was born early in the morning and by the evening I was at home. 'But I began to feel very weak and tired - not myself at all. 'Olivia had been born by C-section, so as I'd never gone through a natural birth before I wasn't sure what to expect, I just thought that the way I was feeling was totally normal. Mrs Cousans was in hospital for 11 weeks, and found it difficult to be away from her daughters. 'I hated being away from them, I was worried all the time and I knew I was missing out on watching them grow up - especially with Megan,' she said . Daughters Olivia Grace, five and baby Megan Rose, 18 months came to visit their mother in hospital and took her scary appearance 'in their stride' Mrs Cousans said her girls gave her the motivation to keep going and her husband Chris was 'amazing' 'But as the days wore on I was getting worse and worse. 'I was constantly thirsty and just totally exhausted - I could barely get out of bed. 'It was only when, six days later, a nurse came out to me, that she took one look at me and told me to get to the hospital immediately. 'Apparently the infection actually gives off a smell, and the nurse could smell it in my bedroom. 'I don't remember much after that, but I know I was in a critical condition. 'I later found out that the doctors had caught me in what they call the 'golden hour' - the hour where they need to diagnose and treat me, or it's too late. 'I was incredibly lucky.' 'My story could have ended so differently, and I know I'm one of the lucky ones - many people don't survive' Mrs Cousans says . Doctors rushed her into an operating theatre where they worked to drain the body of poison. She was then in a coma for 11 days while her body worked to recover. Mrs Cousans, said: 'I was brought out of the coma after 11 days, but my journey was far from over. 'I was given five skin grafts on my legs where they'd cut away the dying tissue, and I then had to begin intensive physiotherapy to get my muscles working again. 'It was awful not being able to move - all I wanted to do was cuddle my girls and I couldn't. 'I hated being away from them, I was worried all the time and I knew I was missing out on watching them grow up - especially with Megan. 'I finally saw them after three weeks, but even then I was worried they'd be scared by my appearance. 'Luckily they took it all in their stride and slowly I went from strength to strength. 'But finally after 11 weeks in hospital I stood up on my own for the very first time, and the doctors agreed that I could go home. 'I was still unwell but being at home with Chris and the girls was the best medicine I could have asked for.' Now Mrs Cousans has recovered, and is keen to raise awareness of the condition that nearly stole her life. She said: 'I still don't know why I got sepsis, but it can happen to anyone at any time. 'I just want to make sure people are aware of the symptoms, and to get medical attention immediately. 'My story could have ended so differently, and I know I'm one of the lucky ones - many people don't survive. 'I can't thank the doctors and nurses who treated me enough, they saved my life.'

"The British Pregnancy Advisory Service said expectant mothers worried about drinking during pregnancy are increasingly demanding abortions . Expectant mothers worried about drinking during pregnancy are increasingly demanding abortions, it emerged yesterday. Britain's biggest abortion organisation reported 'regular' approaches from women who went binge drinking before they knew they were pregnant and who then fear their babies will be born deformed as a result. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service called for 'reassurance' from the NHS and medical authorities that occasional binges would not mean an unborn child will be damaged. The appeal follows years of warnings from medical organisations and the Department of Health that women who drink alcohol during pregnancy can put their baby's health at risk. One NHS website tells women that even a little bit of alcohol can be damaging and result in defects such as facial deformities, learning difficulties and problems with emotional development. BPAS carries out 55,000 abortions each year. Chief executive Ann Furedi said: 'It concerns us greatly when women with wanted pregnancies are driven to consider abortion because they needlessly fear their behaviour has damaged their baby. 'Women should be reassured that the odd night of heavy drinking before they found out they were pregnant is extremely unlikely to have caused their baby harm.' A report from BPAS said: 'Warnings that even one episode of binge drinking by a pregnant woman can cause lifelong damage to her baby are causing serious and unnecessary distress. 'We are now regularly seeing women so concerned that they have harmed their baby before they knew they were pregnant they consider ending what would otherwise be a wanted pregnancy.' The report said occasional binge drinking is a 'fact of life' and added: 'Inevitably this means significant numbers of women will have drunk fairly heavily before finding out they were pregnant. 'Warnings that even small quantities of alcohol can lead to birth defects, facial deformities and learning difficulties can cause deep anxiety among this group of women, who are increasingly seeking advice from BPAS about whether to continue or end the pregnancy.' The organisation gave no figures for numbers of worried women who are making approaches, although it indicated that successive scare stories about the effects of drinking in pregnancy have brought waves of inquiries. BPAS Chief executive Ann Furedi (right) said: 'It concerns us greatly when women with wanted pregnancies are driven to consider abortion because they needlessly fear their behaviour has damaged their baby' However the BPAS claim that half the pregnancies each year are unplanned means, if correct, that nearly 450,000 women in England and Wales are likely to go through the early days and weeks after conception without knowing they are pregnant. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which publishes detailed advice on drinking for pregnant women, said there is room for reassurance for women with unplanned pregnancies. And the Department of Health is planning to produce new guidelines on alcohol and pregnancy next year. A spokesman said: 'Our advice is that pregnant women or women trying to conceive should avoid drinking alcohol. 'If they do choose to drink, to minimise the risk to the baby, they should not drink more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week and should not get drunk. 'The Chief Medical Officer is currently reviewing all the guidelines for drinking.' Thousands of babies are being put at risk due to failings in NHS care for pregnant women with diabetes, a report warns. Many are unwittingly taking ‘hazardous’ medication or have very high blood sugar levels which can harm the unborn child. Charities blamed a lack of care by specialist diabetes doctors, midwives and GPs who should be helping women control the condition. Every year just over 3,000 women in England with diabetes give birth – about half have type 2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity, and the other half type 1. The condition greatly increases the risk of still birth, the baby dying shortly after labour or being born with heart problems or other defects. A report by the Health and Social Care Information Centre found that babies born to women with diabetes are six times more likely to die shortly after birth than the national average. The infant mortality rate for pregnant women with diabetes is 17 per 1,000 compared with 2.8 per 1,000 for healthy women. The report, which looked at 1,700 pregnant women, also found one in ten with type 2 diabetes were taking pills to lower blood sugar. Another 5 per cent of all pregnant women with diabetes were on statins and 2.5 per cent were on high blood pressure pills. Bridget Turner, Diabetes UK director of policy and care improvement, said: ‘Clearly this shows women with diabetes who are pregnant or are considering starting a family are being failed by a system that is not taking their care needs seriously enough.’","Woman are increasingly wanting abortions after drinking during pregnancy .

"A schoolboy with sickle cell disease died after a junior doctor ignored instructions from his consultant to carry out a blood test, an inquest has heard. Emmanuel Akinmuyiwa, seven, from Tyseley, collapsed and died during a blood transfusion after staff 'missed opportunities' to save his life. The boy suffered a cardiac arrest during the transfusion at Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham. It was carried out on February 11, four days after the youngster was admitted to hospital. Emmanuel Akinmuyiwa, seven, from Tyseley, collapsed and died during a blood transfusion after staff 'missed opportunities' to save his life . But the coroner said that blood tests should have been carried out much earlier. If they were, it would have shown a transfusion was required far sooner - perhaps even on the day he arrived. Instead, there was 'insufficient understanding' of the boy's condition and a 'lack of urgency' before any action was taken. The schoolboy suffered from sickle cell disease, a hereditary disorder that can cause red blood cells to mutate and restrict blood flow, Birmingham Coroner's Court was told. The condition was spotted by a GP who referred him to the hospital. After he was admitted, Dr Helen Goodyear, a consultant paediatrician, set up a five-point treatment plan in which she asked for his haemoglobin, or hb, levels to be monitored. That meant taking blood tests to ensure it was still at a healthy level. If the figure fell below five, it would show a definite need for a transfusion, Dr Goodyear told the court. But her direct instructions were ignored by Heartlands staff, the court heard. The inquest heard how a junior doctor failed to take the tests when covering the weekend shift. It was only when another doctor took over four days later that a blood test was taken and a transfusion was finally requested. The doctor found the blood had clotted. After the request, there was still a four-hour wait for the correct blood type to arrive. The hb level was at just 2.7 grams when the transfusion was eventually performed. The young boy, pictured with his sister Christy, suffered from sickle cell disease, a hereditary disorder that can cause red blood cells to mutate and restrict blood flow . Dr Goodyear said she was 'horrified' when she learned her treatment plan had not been followed through by a junior doctor without consultation. Senior coroner Louise Hunt gave the cause of death as cardiac failure caused by severe anaemia due to sickle cell disease. Mrs Hunt said: 'In my conclusion I do find a gross failure in not doing the blood test on the tenth (of February) when there was a clear clinical need and a clear direction to do so. 'There were other failures - to provide a transfusion on either the eighth, ninth or tenth... a failure by all staff to not recognise they had insufficient understanding of this condition and an appreciation of this very serious condition.' Mrs Hunt ordered for a report to be sent to Clinical Commissioning Groups in the West Midlands and NHS England to ensure all trusts were better placed to treat patients with sickle cell disease. Emmanuel's father Oluwasemilogo wrote a letter of complaint to Heartlands and spoke of his loss in a written statement read out in court. 'The whole experience was very traumatic for us,' he said. The young boy died after suffering a cardiac arrest at collapsing during the blood transfusion at Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham . 'He was our youngest child and only son. We had been trying for another child since 1997 and had to wait until 2005. We moved to the UK in 2006 to give our children a better life. 'It's impossible for us to have another child now due to my wife's age. We are still struggling to come to terms with it and have constant recollections of his pain.' Emmanuel was admitted to hospital complaining of a fever, leg pains and dizziness. His healthy hb 'base' level was 8.5 grams per deciliter of whole blood, but it dropped to 5.7 grams shortly after his admission. It was at just 2.7 grams when the transfusion was eventually performed. Dr Sarah Wilson, a consultant haematologist at Birmingham Children's Hospital, which had been approached for advice on Emmanuel's treatment, said transfusions should be performed when a patient's hb count is more than two grams below their base level.","Emmanuel Akinmuyiwa was transferred to Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham .

"A country village has tracked down a half century of its carnival queens - except one. Villagers yesterday put out a public appeal to solve the mystery of their one missing carnival queen after tracking down 49 out of 50 of the women crowned carnival queen as girls since 1964. Michelle Bevan was the village queen in 1976, but all attempts to trace her for a golden anniversary celebration failed. 26 of the of 49 carnival queens from Mathern near Chepstow, South Wales, since the competition started in 1964 . Most of the queens turned up for the 50th birthday party in the village of Mathern near Chepstow, South Wales, to remember the contest. The queens, many of them now mothers and grandmothers, took part in a carnival queen reunion parade and were shown pictures of their winning day. But despite appeals on social media, the carnival committee could not find Michelle, who would now be 50 years old. Villager Mary Pitt said: 'We tried everything to find Michelle but we had to admit we couldn't. 'She moved from Mathern in the late 1970s and was believed to be living about 20 miles away in the Cwmbran area.

Most of the queens still live locally but villagers tracked down others from all over Britain including Scotland, Cornwall and North Wales.

"Warren Buffett has let go of 245million Tesco shares following the supermarket chain's poor performance . Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has dealt Tesco a double blow after dumping more than 245 million of the crisis-hit grocer’s shares just days after branding his holding a ‘huge mistake’. The investment guru, known as the Sage of Omaha, is thought to have lost as much as £500million since investing in the troubled supermarket back in 2006. Buffett’s investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway was the third-largest shareholder, with a 3.97 per cent stake, but it has reduced this. Last week Berkshire reduced its holding to below 3 per cent, and now owns 245.3million shares. At the end of 2013 his stake was valued at around £1billion. Buffett, who is worth an estimated £41.5billion, had already added to Tesco’s woes by admitting buying Tesco was a bad move. In a TV interview he had said: ‘I made a mistake on Tesco. That was a huge mistake by me.’ Shares in Tesco have slumped from 365.50p to 172p over the last 12 months as it stumbled from one disaster to another. Analysts have warned that at below 170p the company looks ripe for a takeover bid. Britain’s biggest retailer has issued three profits warnings and for a period had no executive directors at all on the board after chief executive Philip Clarke was ousted and finance chief Laurie McIlwee was replaced. An investigation has been launched into allegations that bosses inflated Tesco profits by £250million. The supermarket told the City that profits for the six months to August 23 were about £1.1billion, however this was not correct and the real figure was some £250million lower. Tesco's UK managing director Chris Bush (pictured), who was asked to step aside three weeks ago after the most recent profits warning . Among the other eight Tesco executive suspended are head of group food sourcing Matt Simister, left, and finance director Carl Rogberg . Tesco launched its own inquiry involving Deloitte alongside Freshfields, the group's external legal advisers, however the Financial Conduct Authority decided the situation was so serious that it needs to investigate. If it finds evidence of wrong-doing, penalties range from public censure through to large fines for the company and individuals. In a worst case scenario, it is possible executives might be guilty of market abuse which could, in theory, lead to a prosecution for criminal misconduct and a jail sentence. Eight senior executives have been suspended and the results of a probe by accountant Deloitte and law firm Freshfields will be shared at Tesco’s interim update next Thursday. Among those suspended are the UK managing director Chris Bush who was asked to step aside three weeks ago, after the most recent profits warning. Food commercial director John Scouler and finance director Carl Rogberg and Matt Simister, chief executive of Tesco Food Sourcing Ltd were also suspended. Last week it was revealed a fifth executive, reported to be commercial director Kevin Grace had been suspended from duty. And on Tuesday, it was announced three more executives were to be suspended. They are understood to be Dan Jago, head of beer, wine and spirits, and Sean McCurley, director of convenience, together with another category director, William Linnane. New chief executive Dave Lewis said at the time that the suspensions would allow the company to carry out a 'full and frank' investigation and was not disciplinary or an indication of guilt. However, the retailer beefed up its board last week by appointing Richard Cousins, chief executive of catering giant Compass, and Mikael Ohlsson, former boss of Ikea, as non-executive directors. Food commercial director John Scouler, left, and Dan Jago, right, head of beer, wine and spirits were also suspended . It is also reported commercial director Kevin Grace, left and Sean McCurley right, director of convenience are suspended . Tesco has also insisted it would 'continue to co-operate fully with the FCA and other relevant authorities considering this matter'. Buffett first bought into Tesco in 2006, to the tune of £205million, and raised his stake at the start of 2012, a year after Clarke had taken over the helm. Berkshire is the second major shareholder to sell down its stake in Tesco. Last month Tesco’s second biggest shareholder BlackRock said it had reduced its holding to below 5 per cent. New chief executive Dave Lewis said that the suspensions would allow the company to carry out a 'full and frank' investigation and was not disciplinary or an indication of guilt . Many shareholders are waiting to hear the conclusion of the internal investigation next week before taking a decision on their holding and whether they will continue to back the chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent. The Serious Fraud Office is watching the situation closely and the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, has already launched its own probe. Meanwhile last week it emerged that more than 4,000 head office and corporate staff were being sent to work one day a fortnight on the shop floor in the run-up to Christmas, in an initiative by Mr Lewis to try to reconnect those running the group with customers. Tesco's share price in the last year, pictured, has been steadily dropping and the company has now issued three profit warnings in as many months . All of the ‘big four’ supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – have come under fierce pressure from the budget chains such as Aldi and Lidl. At the same time, families are buying less food and they have turned away from using big hypermarkets in favour of making smaller, more regular purchases from convenience stores. The established chains have been dragged into a price war to try and keep customers happy, but this is decimating their profits. February 2011 . Sir Terry Leahy steps down as chief executive on his 55th birthday after 14 years in charge, overseeing a leap in pre-tax profits from £750 million in 1997 to £3.4 billion in April 2010. His record includes the launch of Tesco.com and premium range Tesco Finest and its expansion into America with the Fresh & Easy chain. The market share of the group stands at 30.5 per cent. January 2012 . Less than a year into Philip Clarke's tenure, Tesco shocks the market with its first profit warning in almost 20 years after poor Christmas trading. Shares plunge by as much as 15 per cent, or more than £4 billion. Former chief executive Philip Clarke left the chain earlier this year . Tesco, in common with the country's three other leading grocers - Wal-Mart's Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - finds itself squeezed by discounters Aldi and Lidl and upmarket grocers Waitrose and Marks & Spencer. April 2012 . Tesco unveils a £1 billion UK revival plan, which includes upgrading stores, the recruitment of more staff and better prices and value. The initiative follows complaints that its 2,800 stores are cold and industrial with poor levels of service. April 2013 . The retailer reports its first fall in annual profits in 19 years, with post-tax profit tumbling almost 96 per cent to £120 million from a year earlier. The figure is hit by a £1.2 billion charge on the retailer's US Fresh & Easy chain of around 200 stores as it confirms it will leave the country. The firm also suffers a £804 million write-down in the UK on land for more than 100 major stores, bought at the height of the property boom, which will no longer be developed. February 2014 . The supermarket promises to spend an additional £200 million on lower prices for basic products, such as carrots, tomatoes, onions, peppers and cucumbers. It will also rein in annual capital spending to no more than £2.5 billion for at least the next three years as a result of the dramatic reduction in store expansion - nearly half the £4.7 billion spent in 2008/09. April 2014 . Mr Clarke brushes off speculation about his future despite little sign that his £1 billion plan to turn around the retail juggernaut is bearing fruit. Profits fall 6.9 per cent to £3.05 billion for the year to February 22 while fourth-quarter like-for-like sales slump by 3 per cent as its UK market share falls to 28.6 per cent in the 12 weeks to March 31, from 29.7 per cent in the same period a year earlier.

Till-roll figures from Kantar Worldpanel show a decline in Tesco's market share to 29% in the 12 weeks to May 25, compared with 30.5 per cent a year earlier. A day later, the chain reports a 3.7 per cent fall in like-for-like sales for the first quarter of its financial year. It is a performance that Mr Clarke admits is the worst he has seen in four decades at the supermarket chain. At the company's annual meeting, chairman Sir Richard Broadbent asks shareholders to give management more time to complete their turnaround plans. July 2014 . Tesco announces that Mr Clarke will step down from the board on October 1 to be replaced by Unilever executive Dave Lewis. Sales and trading profit in the first half of the year are 'somewhat below' expectations, the company adds. August 2014 . Tesco issues profit warning to tell the markets that it expects its first-half profits will be £400million less than expected. It slashes dividend payments by 75 per cent and £1billion is wiped off the company's market value. The change at the top of the supermarket is brought forward by a month in order to allow Mr Lewis to commence a review of 'every aspect' of the group's operations. September 2014 . Company launches an investigation after admitting that its previously warned of fall in takings actually over-estimated profits by as much as £250million. The error relates to timing issues on when Tesco's UK business reports the income it receives from suppliers.

"Lying helpless on the ground of a dirty paddy field, these elephants are the latest victims of the brutal ivory trade. The elephants were discovered by an Indian forest official in a field in Kokilamari in Shivasagar, India. In a savage attack, thought to have been carried out by poachers, the animals' tusks were removed after being poisoned. The elephants were found dead by an Indian forest official in a field in Kokilamari in Shivasagar, India . In the savage attack, thought to have been carried out by poachers, the animals' tusks were removed . India's location and array of wildlife makes it particularly susceptible to poachers who can easily export the goods. Because the price of ‘blood ivory’ - illegally poached tusks – is spiralling, poaching gangs are developing fresh techniques to slaughter animals in huge numbers, such as food poisoning. The demand for ivory, also referred to as white-gold, is at its highest in China, where it is used in decorations and in traditional medicines, fueling a multi-billion-pound illicit trade. Because the price of ‘blood ivory’ - illegally poached tusks – is spiralling, poaching gangs are developing fresh techniques to slaughter animals in huge numbers, such as food poisoning . Sacred but exploited, the Asian elephant has been worshipped for centuries and is still used today for ceremonial and religious purposes. Not only is it revered for its role within Asian culture and religion, it is also a key biological species in the tropical forests of Asia. But the animal is now threatened by extinction in the wild and the country's wild elephant population was recently estimated at about 26,000. This is despite an on going operation  in the Karbi Anglong hills, in which several poachers have been arrested. High profile figures, including Prince William and Hillary Clinton have also unveiled plans to target elephant poaching. In February, Prince William launched United For Wildlife, a coalition of seven organisations including the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and London Zoo, which aims to end the illegal wildlife trade. And in September last year, Hilary Clinton put forward a £50million plan to tackle poaching. Rhinos are also highly prized and in India's Kaziranga National Park, rhinos had their horns removed while still alive, before bleeding to death. The horns are highly sought after in Asia, where they are used in traditional medicines.","Three elephants were killed by suspected food poisoning in India .

"Gisele Bundchen has slammed advertisements that promote 'unattainable' beauty. The Brazilian supermodel - who is the new face of Chanel's No 5 fragrance - said that while ads for such brands can be seen as 'aspirational,' they are often  a distant reality for the majority of women. The 34-year-old beauty told The Sunday Times Style magazine: 'Sometimes I feel like adverts like this can make women feel so distant. Unrealistic: Gisele Bundchen, who is the new face of Chanel No 5, has slammed advertisements that promote 'unattainable' beauty . Conscious effort: Ms Bundchen, seen in a new short film for Chanel No 5, insists that the fashion house has tried to make its latest campaign more relatable to regular women . Of course, some might call the leggy model - who plays a glamorous surfing mom in a short film released by Chanel last week - a tad hypocritical. 'They are so glamorous and so unattainable and so aspirational that you really can't touch them, in a way. They are kind of a dream,' she continues. However, Ms Bundchen insists that the Parisian fashion house has made a conscious effort to make its latest campaign more relatable to regular women. Art imitates life: Ms Bundchen, seen in the new Chanel film, said her character 'is a mother, a wife and a professional, and she is juggling all of that, and you know that's not easy' 'The idea really was to show this modern woman and all that she is, with her struggles and her vulnerability. And yes, she is glamorous. Of course she's glamorous - she is powerful and successful - but she is also struggling,' she said. 'You know she is a mother, a wife and a professional, and she is juggling all of that, and you know that's not easy,' continued Ms Bundchen, who is mother to Vivian, 22 months, Benjamin, four, and a stepson Jack, seven, with her husband, NFL star Tom Brady. Chanel unveiled the short video directed by Baz Luhrmann last week, which sees Ms Bundchen's character trying to balance her personal life with her role as a mother to a young daughter. Empowering: 'We want to have more than just to be the pretty woman who sits there,' Ms Bundchen said . ""In a way Gisele became the script,' Mr Luhrmann told Vogue UK. 'I knew her when she was quite young and starting out, and she's evolved so much in both her life and work. The film reflects that - this woman has a child, a real job and then she has this relationship. Gisele is the Chanel woman now.' The stunning mom also stressed the importance of balancing her busy work schedule with raising her children, believing it is 'empowering' when women like herself are able to perform both roles. Family matters: Ms Bundchen (right) spends a day the park in Boston with husband Tom Brady (left) and their daughter Vivian and son Benjamin . She said: 'We are all trying to juggle these different parts, and it's not easy. No matter how much work you put in, no matter how glamorous it looks. We always put pressure on ourselves. 'We should be allowed to dream and to want more. We want to have more than just to be the pretty woman who sits there. I think that it's a very empowering thing for me to be able to be successful in my job and not feel like I need to sacrifice being a mother.'","Ms Bundchen insists that her character in Chanel's new short film is relatable to women because she is 'struggling' to balance her roles as a mother, a wife and a professional .
Some might argue that the flawless Brazilian supermodel is being hypocritical in her critique of these aspirational images ."
"A soap opera actress who has starred on 'One Life to Live' and 'Guiding Light' has escaped prison after allegedly smashing a pint glass into another woman's face in a bar brawl. Crystal Hunt, 29, a former Daytime Emmy Award nominee, hurled the glass at the victim following an argument at Pearl's Liquor Bar in West Hollywood on December 13, prosecutors told TMZ. The unnamed woman suffered a number of cuts to her face and required medical attention, while Hunt was arrested and charged with felony assault with a deadly weapon.

Scene: Miss Hunt hurled the glass at the victim after a fight broke out at Pearl's Liquor Bar (pictured) in West Hollywood, prosecutors said. The unnamed woman suffered cuts to her face and required medical attention . Yesterday, the actress pleaded no contest to one count of felony assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury, according to a statement by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office. If she had pleaded not guilty and been convicted of the charge, she could have been imprisoned for up to five years, OnTheRedCarpet.com reported at the time. But instead, Hunt avoided prison after LA Superior Court Judge Kathryn Solorzano sentenced her to three years of probation and 45 days of  work for the California Department of Transportation. Following her arrest last year, the actress reportedly claimed she had been acting in self-defense when she threw the pint glass filled with water because the woman had been harassing her.

"A nightclub staged an Ebola-themed Halloween student party last night where revellers were advised to go to the bar for ‘decontamination and quarantine’. Bar Risa in Birmingham has admitted making a ‘huge error’ after coming under fire over the event - and said it plans to donate profits from last night's event to the Doctors Without Borders charity. An advert declared that the local area had been ‘infected’ by the deadly disease and that the World Health Organisation (WHO) wanted students to go to the bar for ‘decontamination and quarantine’. 'Huge error': Promotions staff and bar tenders at Bar Risa were given hazmat-style contamination suits to wear . Poor taste: Revellers were advised to go to the bar at the nightclub for 'decontamination and quarantine' 'Quarantine area': An advert declared that the local area had been 'infected' by the deadly disease . 'Prepare for decontamination': Signs in red paint outside the club told revellers they were in a 'Safe zone' Causing uproar: Scores of horrified people took to social media to criticise the event in Birmingham last night . The bar on Broad Street was decked out for the occasion with fake biohazard tape reading ‘Quarantine’ and signs in red paint outside the club told revellers they were in a ‘Safe zone’. Promotions staff and bar tenders were given hazmat-style contamination suits to wear and party-goers, many dressed as zombies, had to walk through a ‘decontamination tunnel’ to gain access. The bad-taste party held last night comes as the WHO confirmed that nearly 5,000 people have died from Ebola, the fatal disease which has devastated Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Scores of horrified people took to social media to criticise the event. Min Jhitta wrote: ‘Bar Risa are having an 'Ebola breakout party' for Halloween?

Jason Alexander tweeted: ‘So Bar Risa in Brum held an Ebola themed Halloween party... #classy.’ Another Twitter user, going by the name of NoWalkITPark, said: ‘I cannot begin to put into words how bad taste and insensitive this Ebola party is. You are a complete bunch of idiots.’ A spokesman for Bar Risa said: ‘The event was run by a third party promoter and we can only apologise for such a huge error of judgement on our part in letting them run the event. ‘We will be donating all profits to Doctors Without Borders and we wholeheartedly apologise to anyone we have offended.’ MailOnline reported on Sunday how websites and bars appeared to be cashing in on the Ebola crisis by selling costumes for Halloween, mocked up to look like a containment suit being worn by volunteers  treating those who are infected. The costume appeared on the Brands On Sale website, and a description said: 'As the deadly Ebola virus trickles its way through the United States, fighting its disease is no reason to compromise style.'","Bar Risa in Birmingham admits 'huge error' over the event last night .

"They were an obscure, short-lived 1970s rock band whose only achievement was an undistinguished second place in a Perth talent contest. But now, 35 years after they split up, a single recorded by Scots group Glory Hunter has become one of the world’s most sought-after records, with copies changing hands for more than £1,000. Back in 1979, the four members of the outfit from Livingston, West Lothian, pooled their resources to record debut single Thoughts of Destiny but they split up only weeks later. Then and now: Former lead singer Kenny Hanlon in 1979 with Rough Edge, the band he was in before Glory Hunter and right, the 59-year-old with the band's highly sought after record Thoughts of Destiny . The band pooled their resources to record Thoughts of Destiny, now a collectors item, but split up soon after . Now, to the great surprise of former lead singer Kenny Hanlon, records from the run of 1,000 have become highly sought after, with one expert describing them as ‘rarer than hen’s teeth’. One copy fetched £1,090 on eBay in 2011 and another is the most valuable single listed on collectors’ site 991.com, its £895 price tag outstripping classics by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and Bruce Springsteen. Grandfather and father-of-five Mr Hanlon, 59, said yesterday: ‘I suppose I should be chuffed, but to be honest I’m more mystified. ‘I’ve absolutely no idea why a single by an unknown band from Scotland that fell apart a few weeks after recording their only single should be so valuable. Three records by British band The Beatles are on the top ten list of the most valuable records in the world .

Source: Record Collector magazine . ‘When I first saw the record had sold for over £1,000 on eBay I thought it was a wind-up. I couldn’t take it in. ‘We had 1,000 copies pressed and we paid for the whole thing ourselves. We didn’t have a record deal or anything. ‘We sold a few copies at gigs but the band split up before we had a chance to get a distribution deal.’ In early 1979 Mr Hanlon, then aged around 24, joined the band which comprised guitarist Derek Hawthorne, Tam Mollins on bass and drummer Stuart Tennant. They played a handful of concerts and took part in a Scottish Rock Band of the Year competition in Perth, where they came second to an ELO tribute act. Mr Hanlon said: ‘We were quite organised and we decided to finance the single ourselves. We paid for the studio time, the pressing, everything. ‘But there were already tensions within the band when I joined and a few weeks after the single came out the bass player and the drummer left. ‘Let’s just say there were a few musical differences and personality problems going on.’ Jon Ashby of 991.com said: ‘There is very little information for this release. It was an extremely limited press and sold by the band only at their gigs and comes in a plain company sleeve as there were no picture sleeves produced. ‘Very few rock fans have even heard of Glory Hunter. They were categorised in a movement which became known as the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which was spearheaded by Iron Maiden. ‘It’s unusual for such a little-known band to become so collectible.

"She is remembered as the 'toad-faced' Hogwarts professor who forced Harry Potter to cut the words 'I must not tell lies' on to his hand. But it has now been revealed that Dolores Umbridge, played by Imelda Staunton in the film franchise, was based on a teacher novelist JK Rowling hated from her school days. The  author said the malicious character, who is just as fond of pink fluffy cardigans and kittens as she is of barbaric teaching practices, was inspired by a woman she 'disliked intensely on sight'. Scroll down for video . Harry Potter author JK Rowling (left) revealed that character Dolores Umbridge, played by Imelda Staunton (right), was based on a teacher form school . She said she feels the 'purest dislike' for the 'toad-faced' teacher as her desire to control, punish and inflict pain in the name of law and order rivals Lord Voldemort's incarnation of evil. Ms Rowling did not reveal the identity of the woman, but said she had been her teacher or instructor 'long ago… in a certain skill or subject'. 'The woman in question returned my antipathy with interest,' she wrote on her Pottermore website. 'Why we took against each other so instantly, heartily and (on my side, at least) irrationally, I honestly cannot say. Professor Umbridge is remembered as the 'toad-faced' Hogwarts professor who forced Harry Potter to cut the words 'I must not tell lies' on to his hand, pictured in the Order of the Phoenix . JK Rowling said she feels the 'purest dislike' for the teacher as her desire to control, punish and inflict pain in the name of law and order rivals Lord Voldemort's incarnation of evil . 'What sticks in my mind is her pronounced taste for twee accessories. I particularly recall a tiny little plastic bow slide, pale lemon in colour that she wore in her short curly hair. 'I used to stare at that little slide, which would have been appropriate to a girl of three, as though it was some kind of repellent physical growth.' Umbridge who first appears in the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, was installed at Hogwarts by the Ministry of Magic. Madam Undersecretary Professor Dolores Jane Umbridge is a half-blood witch and Ministry of Magic bureaucrat. She served as Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic under Ministers Cornelius Fudge, Rufus Scrimgeour, and Pius Thicknesse. In 1995 by order of the Ministry, she was installed as Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She later became Hogwarts High Inquisitor and Headmistress. Birthday: 26th August . Wand: Birch and dragon heartstring, eight inches long . Hogwarts house: Slytherin . Special abilities: Her punishment quill is of her own invention . Parentage: Muggle mother, wizard father . Family: Unmarried, no children . Hobbies: Collecting the 'Frolicsome Feline' ornamental plate range, adding flounces to fabric and frills to stationary objects, inventing instruments of torture . The professor is the only person other than Lord Voldemort to leave a permanent physical scar on Harry. She is also known for her many infamous deeds, including orchestrating the Dementor attack on Harry and Dudley at Magnolia Crescent and sacking Hagrid. Ms Rowling was quick to point out that the teacher she based the character on was not sadistic or vicious to her or anyone else. 'I never heard her express a single view in common with Umbridge (indeed, I never knew her well enough to know much about her views or preferences, which makes my dislike of her even less justifiable),' she said. 'However, it is true to say that I borrowed from her, then grossly exaggerated, a taste for the sickly sweet and girlish in dress, and it was that tiny little pale lemon plastic bow that I was remembering when I perched the fly-like ornament on Dolores Umbridge's head.' The author also revealed she shared an office with a woman who covered the wall with pictures of fluffy kittens, but was also a bigoted champion of the death penalty. 'I have noticed more than once in life that a taste for the ineffably twee can go hand-in-hand with a distinctly uncharitable outlook on the world,' she said. 'I once shared an office with a woman who had covered the wall space behind her desk with pictures of fluffy kitties; she was the most bigoted, spiteful champion of the death penalty with whom it has ever been my misfortune to share a kettle. 'A love of all things saccharine often seems present where there is a lack of real warmth or charity.' She has previously used the website to update the Potter stories and offer fans a glimpse into the lives of her characters after the books ended. In one, she wrote about a school reunion that saw a now 34-year-old Harry back at Hogwarts with 'threads of silver' in his black hair and a mysterious cut over his cheekbone which signifies his membership of a top-secret group of wizards called the Aurors.

"White sand beaches, azure waters, minimal crowds and authentic local cultural experiences - a wish list for many when it comes to the perfect holiday and also, remarkably, just some of the features of the least popular destinations in the world. While France, US, Spain, China and Italy make up the top five most visited nations on the planet with tourist arrivals in the tens of millions some of the most incredible landscapes in the world were largely avoided by international tourists in the past year. For some places, such as Palau in the Western Pacific and Niue in the South Pacific, geography is a major barrier to them being a place appreciated by millions rather than the few thousand who make the effort to grace their shores. For others, the reasons aren't so clear. Here are the 10 destinations out of those the United Nations World Tourism Organisation's 2014 survey of international arrivals gathered information from, which attracted the least visitors last year. 10) PALAU . 2013 visitors: 105,000 . Location can be the only reason this independent archipelago nation with a population of 21,000 stretched across its 250 islands in the Western Pacific Ocean is on this list. If easyJet or Ryanair flew here it would be teeming with tourists. But since they don't, to get to its most populous island, Koror, from the UK we must fly through Seoul, Taipei and/or Guam - it's instead beautifully peaceful and brimming with exotic wildlife. Usually those who make the effort to get here do so to dive among its stunning coral reefs, wrecks, caves and more than 60 vertical drop-offs in water stacked with brightly-coloured tropical fish and sea creatures, including giant fluted clams that weigh over 500 pounds. On land, visitors encounter exotic birds, orchids aplenty, crocodiles and incredibly friendly locals. Signs instruct them to WAVE (Welcome All Visitors Enthusiastically). Scroll down for video . Colourful coral reefs and tropical fish along with giant flute clams that weigh a massive 550 pounds can be found in the waters off Palau . With flights needing to go through locales such as Seoul, Taipei or Guam, Palau remains an isolated island paradise . These stone monoliths on Babeldaob, one of Palau's 250 islands,  date back to 161AD - not quite Stonehenge but the setting sure gives Wiltshire a run for its money . 9) MOLDOVA . 2013 visitors: 96,000 . Adventure is tough to come by these days in Eastern Europe with most destinations set up to offer these most and get the most out of tourists, but not Moldova. Between Romania and Ukraine it hasn't had the best of times since it became independent from the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. It hasn't moved on much since then with civil war and financial instability putting efforts to bring in outsiders on the backburner. But with that, for some, may come its charm. An unaffected snapshot of Soviet times in Transdniestr (which doesn't operate under Moldovan control), unspoiled if unremarkable landscapes, a unique history, impressive cave monasteries and an active wine industry, with tours available to visitors, are some of its limited attractions. A stone cross stands out atop the Orheiul Vechi Monastery in Moldova, a small European nation between Romania and Ukraine that is largely avoided by tourists . Unspoiled landscapes and wine are among Moldova's greatest attractions that less than 100,000 visitors took advantage of in 2013 . 8) EAST TIMOR . 2013 visitors: 78,000 . East Timor is another nation on the list that's had a tumultuous time politically, but that is stunningly unspoiled in parts and is well worth seeing before it gets on the tourist radar. Sun, sea and secluded sand are on offer along with mountains for trekking and cycling. With all of the local government's budget dependent on oil, this nation north of Australia is slowly battling to carve its own identity since gaining independence from Indonesia in 2002. A small church is elevated on a hill in the midst of an incredible mountain landscape near Maubisse, East Timor . Traders sell fish in the  Colmera commercial district of Dili, the capital of East Timor . Courtesy of Caroline Pemberton . 7) DOMINICA . 2013 visitors: 78,000 . A Caribbean paradise without the crowds can be found in Dominica, which suffers for its dearth of white sandy beaches and mass resorts. The volcanic island, not to be confused with Haiti's neighbour the Dominican Republic, is in the lesser Antilles and terrific for trekking, relaxing in sulphur springs and snorkelling. But while the locals are beyond delighted to have you there, with tourism a big money spinner for the nation, a bare minimum take the opportunity. The catch is a lack of direct flights and a wealth of nearby alternatives better equipped to snap up the tourist dollar. On the southern coast of the volcanic island of Dominica you'll find Soufriere village, perched on the edge of a former crater . Dominica's most popular activities are focused on the water, of course. Here are its famous volcanic air bubbles that gave inspiration for the name Champagne Beach . 6) ST VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES . 2013 visitors: 72,000 . Get here, quick, as the above number will change. Saint Vincent is densely populated but the Grenadines, a series of 31 islands, are most certainly not - tranquil and beautiful with white sand and the bluest of blue water, and easily accessible via new ferries. Other than bananas, tourism is the next biggest industry here and authorities are looking to expand the islands' appeal. For now it's an alternative to its more well-established neighbours, Saint Lucia and Barbados. Also made famous by the Pirates of the Caribbean films, which were shot here. Azure waters and white sand is a total cliche and both are found in abundances in St Vincent and the Grenadines, where there's a host of uninhabited islands like this . A couple sunbathes on a catamaran as they float through the Grenadines . 5) ANGUILLA . 2013 visitors: 69,000 . While it's postcard-perfect and another of the Caribbean islands to escape the hordes, this British overseas territory to the east of Puerto Rico is not at all cheap. A deputy of sorts to the celebrity hotspot St Bart's, it's clinging onto its authenticity for dear life as fancy new holiday homes pop up to take advantage of the pristine beaches. In Anguilla, considered a less deluxe alternative to St Bart's, the national sport is yacht racing . A single-person yacht sails out through Anguilla's Maundays Bay . 4) LIECHTENSTEIN . 2013 visitors: 60,000 . The sixth smallest country in the world is also the richest by GDP. Liechtenstein is an outdoor enthusiasts' playground and renowned for its incredible natural beauty and quaint villages. Landlocked by Switzerland and Austria, the German-speaking principality is the only country in the world to be totally in the Alps. A summer haven for hiking and cycling and snow-covered skiing perfection in winter, for those who can afford it. A vineyard with in Gutenburg castle in the background in the town of Balzers in southern Liechtenstein, the sixth smallest country in the world but the richest by GDP . The country is renowned for its natural beauty and outdoor sports, hiking in summer and skiing in winter . Liechtenstein boasts a vast array of cross country and alpine skiing given the entire country in situated in the Alps . 3) NIUE . 2013 visitors: 7,000 . With Tonga to the west, Samoa to the north, Cook Islands to the east and New Zealand 1,500 miles away, most people from Niue moved away from this beautiful little island due to its isolation. Just 1,400 people live here, but they're more than welcoming to the few who make the journey to visit. Referred to as 'The Rock' (short for Rock of Polynesia) 20 per cent of the island is made up of the pristine Huvalu Forest Conservation Area, so natural beauty is the best it has to offer. And if you're sick of paying for the internet, it's free here - Niue became the world's first wifi nation in 2003.

A buttressed tree in the extensive and pristine rain forest on Niue - 20 per cent of the island is made up by the Huvalu Forest Conservation Area . 2) MONTSERRAT . 2013 visitors: 7,000 . Once a popular holiday spot, this Lesser Antilles island has never quite recovered from a series of horrific natural disasters. Hurricane Hugo in 1989 hit 90 per cent of the island's structures and in 1995 it was battered when the previously dormant Soufriere Hills volcano erupted. That destroyer is now one of its main draw cards though, along with remarkable beaches and a distinctive laid-back atmosphere.

The two extremes of the perfect waters off Montserrat and the reminder of the pyroclastic flow of the volcano lava that so devastated the island . 1) KIRIBATI . 2013 visitors: 6,000 . It's in the middle of nowhere! People often use that term but Kiribati really is, with the nearest civilisation five hours north in Hawaii. Straddling the equator in the Pacific Ocean, it was known as the Gilbert Islands while under British rule. With some remnants of the terrible battles here during World War II, Western influence is minimal on the islands outside the main one, Tarawa. As they have for centuries locals live on coconuts, breadfruit and fish. Its 33 atolls, with their majestic turquoise lagoons, cover a massive 1.3million square miles of the Pacific. Once there, explore islands on bike, boat or foot, and appreciate the world's largest protected marine area.

"A portrait of King Louis XIV, the Sun King . During the 72-year reign of Louis XIV - the longest of any major European monarch - French became the universal language of the European elite. So it is not exactly surprising that French critics have reacted angrily to the news he is to become the protagonist in a new 'dumbed down' television show - produced in English. Critics have labelled it a 'crime' to have the great monarch speak in English - particularly as the ten-part series is being made by French station Canal Plus. The show, called Versailles, has also been written by Brits - Dame Helen Mirren's nephew Simon Mirren and Spooks creator David Wolstencroft - and stars British actors. George Blagden, best known for his role as Grantaire in the 2012 film adaptation of Les Miserables, will play the role of the Sun King. It may be small comfort to critics that Blagden is at least fluent in French, as is Amira Casar, another British-born actor who will play a courtesan called Beatrice. Seeing 24-year-old Blagden speak in English could be a strange experience for French viewers, as he fought William of Orange's English disciples during the Glorious Revolution. The series will cost a huge £21million - which works out as twice as much per episode as Downton Abbey. It will follow a young Louis XIV from 1660, 17 years into his reign when he is 22, on his journey to become the most powerful monarch in Europe, from his battles with the fronde through his development into the Sun King. A synopsis for the show on spoilertv reads: 'Born strategist, mischievous manipulator, Louis will use every resource at his disposal to keep the Noblesse on a short leach, while feeling bitter resentment in his private life, even paranoia. The man is also capable of romantic passion. But how to live them when you're the greatest king in the world? The show will follow a young Louis XIV from 1660, 17 years into his reign when he is 22, on his journey to become the most powerful monarch in Europe . The series will cost a huge £21million - which works out as twice as much per episode as Downton Abbey . The show, called Versailles, has been written by Brits - Dame Helen Mirren's nephew Simon Mirren and Spooks creator David Wolstencroft - and stars British actors . 'The first season will see the young King evolve to become the Sun King, the King of the Kings. Characters both real or fictional, from courtesans to humble paysans, will guide us through a world of betrayals and secrecy, political manoeuvres and war declarations, revealing Versailles in all of its glory and brutality. A golden cage where arrivists, ready to do anything to get in, will never be able to get out.' Leonardo Di Caprio played Louis XIV in the 1998 film The Man in the Iron Mask, but Versailles is being produced by a French station, Canal Plus . Canal Plus will premiere the show next year, and it will not be the first time they have produced television in English - it was also behind Borgia. Nor is it the first time Louis XIV will have spoken English on screen. He was played by Leonardo Di Caprio in 1998 film The Man in the Iron Mask. But the fact that this series has been produced by a French station and is being broadcast in France  makes it a little harder for critics to stomach. 'It is very worrying and totally implausible that a series about Louis XIV should be made in English,' Gaston Pellet of the United Republican Group for Linguistic Renaissance, Initiative and Emancipation told The Times. 'We have nothing against English, but we don't want French to become a second language in France.' The decision to produce in English has been made because it will make the show easier to sell outside of France. Director of fiction at Canal Plus, Fabrice de la Patelliere, called it a 'pragmatic choice to enable the series to be exported'. In France itself, viewers will be able to choose to watch the show with subtitles or dubbed in French.

"A 10-month-old girl in Louisiana is in a hospital after being trapped underneath her father's decomposing body for several days. Sabine Parish Deputy Coroner Ron Rivers says that the infant, Betty Jean Fields, was dehydrated and had blistering skin, the Shreveport Times reported. 'It was able to breath, expand its chest up and down,' Rivers say of the girl. 'We're very blessed that the baby didn't succumb.' Betty had a seizure when she first arrived at LSU Medical Center in Shreveport, but she was already playing with stuffed animals later, KSLA reported. She was listed in good condition on Sunday is expected to make a full recovery. The infant, Betty Jean Fields,  is expected to make a full recovery after she was taken to LSU Medical Center (pictured) in Shreveport, Louisiana . The mother was in jail on misdemeanor charges at the time but was released on Saturday to care for the baby girl and her 5-year-old brother, who had alerted neighbors on Friday night. Rivers said he found Jason Fields, 43,  dead on a bed alongside a laptop computer at the home in the small town of Pleasant Hill, south of Shreveport. He appeared to be sitting on the side of his bed when he fell backward and died. 'The fact that he fell on her and made no attempt to get up tells me he died instantly when he fell on top of her,' Rivers told The Times. The house had no air conditioning and Rivers said the ambient temperature was more than 100 degrees when he entered. Deputies were called to the Fields' home Friday after the girl's 5-year-old brother went next door to tell neighbors he thought his father was dead. The boy didn't suffer any injuries — but it is still unclear how survived for three days, the Times reported. No autopsy will be performed on Fields, who had a history of cardiac problems, because of the condition of the body.","Jason Fields, 43, died on a bed and fell on top of his 10-month-old daughter, Betty Jean Fields .

"Officials said Wednesday that a drug gang implicated in the disappearance of 43 students in a southern city essentially ran the town, paying the mayor hundreds of thousands of dollars a month out of its profits from making opium paste to fuel the U.S. heroin market. The statements painted the fullest picture yet of the control that is exercised by gangs over a broad swath of Mexico's hot lands in Guerrero state. The Guerreros Unidos cartel's deep connections with local officials in Iguala came to a head Sept. 26 when the mayor ordered city police to detain protesting students, who were then turned over to the drug gang. Since then, Mexican authorities have been searching for the students, spurred on by increasingly violent demonstrations that included the burning of Iguala's city hall by protesters Wednesday. On the run: Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda went on the lam following the deadly attack. Pineda is accused of being 'the main operator of criminal activities' in Iguala . Where are they? Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam, seen Wednesday, said investigators had found a total of nine mass graves containing 30 sets of human remains during the hunt for the missing students . Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said on Wednesday that investigators had found a total of nine mass graves containing 30 sets of human remains during the hunt for the missing students. He said officials were waiting for a second round of DNA tests, after a first round determined they weren't the bodies of the students. While the students remain missing, Murillo Karam said the arrests of Iguala police officers and the leader of the Guerreros Unidos gang, Sidronio Casarrubias, had provided more evidence about the events leading up to their disappearance. Murillo Karam said the students, who attended a radical rural teachers college, had gained the enmity of Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca because of a previous demonstration in the city. He said Abarca ordered police to detain students who hijacked four buses because the mayor thought they were going to try to disrupt a speech by his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda. Abarca, his wife and the Iguala police chief are all fugitives. Connected: Authorities had previously reported that the wife, Pineda, had family ties to the Guerreros Unidos drug cartel, and its leader said Mayor Abarca was paid between $150,000-$220,000 every few weeks, as a bribe and to pay off his corrupt police force . A mass was held on October 14 for the 43 students that disappeared . A mass protest also took place on Wednesday in Guadalajara for the students . Authorities had previously reported that the wife, Pineda, had family ties to Guerreros Unidos. But Murillo Karam said it was much more than that, reporting that Casarrubias, the arrested drug gang leader, said she was 'the main operator of criminal activities' in Iguala. Casarrubias also said the mayor had gotten payments of 2 million to 3 million pesos ($150,000-$220,000) every few weeks, as a bribe and to pay off his corrupt police force. After Iguala police picked up the students, Murillo Karam said, the youths were taken to a police station and then to the nearby town of Cocula. At some point they were loaded aboard a dump truck and taken - apparently still alive - to an area on the outskirts of Iguala where the mass graves have been found, he said. At that point, Casarrubias told authorities, one of his lieutenants told him the students were members or sympathizers of a rival gang, the attorney general said. A government building was burned on October 14 in a protest over the missing students . Mexican authorities have been searching for the students, spurred on by increasingly violent demonstrations that included the burning of Iguala's city hall by protesters Wednesday. Protesters are seen here in Guadalajara . Guerreros Unidos had sufficient money to bribe the mayor and local police force because they have increasingly turned to the lucrative practice of growing opium poppies and sending opium paste to be refined for heroin destined for the U.S. market, another federal official said Wednesday. The official, who is familiar with the case but insisted on speaking anonymously because he is not authorized to be quoted by name, said Guerreros Unidos started turning more to opium after income from marijuana trafficking dropped, apparently because of legalization of the drug in some U.S. states. After paying local farmers to grow opium poppies in the rough mountains around Iguala, the gang warehoused and shipped the opium out to other regions to be refined, the official said. 'They stockpiled the paste; they sell it to other criminal organizations,' the official said.","Officials have said the Guerreros Unidos cartel implicated in the disappearance of 43 students in Iguala, Mexico essentially ran the town .

"The 'Dream Home' built by novelist John Irving has gone on the market for $3million. The 72-year-old, who achieved international acclaim for The World According to Garp and The Cider House Rules, designed the Dorset, Vermont, mansion with his wife Janet. Their aim was to create a property that was both a work space and a retreat. The couple finished building it in 1989, and 25 years on, they are selling up. Novelist John Irving is selling his 8,300 square-foot five-bedroom home in Dorset, Vermont, for $3million . The luxury mansion, which sits on 11.53 acres, has a swimming pool and stunning views across the hills . The 8,300-square-foot estate, being sold through Sothebys, offers five large bedrooms, six bathrooms and most importantly for the award-winning author 'the ability to get up in the morning and simply go to work where you live'. It also has a gym with a full-sized wrestling court, allowing Mr Irving to practice his beloved sport, all spread across across nearly 12 acres of private land equipped with tennis courts and a pool. There is also a large office where Mr Irving would spend up to nine hours a day writing. He would have to wear a hat and sunglasses while at his desk because so much light is let in. A large shower, bathroom and private sauna complete the first floor. The master bedroom offers a sitting area, large fitted closet, expansive bath, and separate ladies dressing room . The writer holds up his Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay with The Cider House Rules in 2000. After 25 years living in the Vermont house with his wife, he has decided to move to an apartment in Toronto . Mr Irving, who achieved critical acclaim for his novels including The World According to Garp and Cider House Rules, said he wanted to create a home which could be both a retreat and a place of work . One of the reasons he chose the location was because of the spectacular views of the Green Mountains . The property has a gym which includes a range of equipment including rowing machines and exercise bikes . 'It's not only the house that I've been in the longest,' says the writer, 'but I have to say, it's been a very happy period in my life that I've been living here.' According to the Wall Street Journal, Ms Irving fitted the home with furniture she said wasn't 'precious' and could be used by the family. Irving achieved critical and popular acclaim after the international success of The World According to Garp in 1978. The Cider House Rules (1985), which was later turned into a film starring Michael Caine, and A Prayer for Owen Meany (1989), have also been bestsellers. The room also has a full-sized wrestling court. Photos show Irving playing the sport as he grew up. He was a wrestling coach as well as a wrestler in high school and college . In 1999, after nearly 10 years in development, Irving's screenplay for The Cider House Rules was made into a film and earned Irving an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He is now said to be finishing his 14th novel, Avenue of Mysteries, about an older Mexican-American man who travels to the Philippines and reflects on his childhood in Mexico. The couple are now moving to their apartment in Toronto. Mr Irving's main concern, according to the Journal, is that he won't have enough room for the hundreds of family photos he has of his family. Pictured is the novelist's author where he spends up to eight hours a day writing by hand . Potential petrol-headed residents will be able to fit three cars in this enormous garage that sits at the back of the sprawling property . Around the side of the house is a stone terrace which also offers spectacular views of the surrounding area . The master suite offers a sitting area, large fitted closet, expansive bath, and separate ladies dressing room . The dining room, which has easy access to the wet bar and kitchen, is perfect for entertaining guests . Ms Irving is said to have fitted the home with furniture she did not consider to be 'precious' so it could be used by all members of the family . Following a day of working or walking in the surroundings, the new owners can sit in front of the television or simply stare out into the surrounding gardens . A breakfast bar separates the dining table and the kitchen. Book shelves cover the walls around the house . After a long day of writing, Mr Irving enjoys to cook in this spacious kitchen. A mock street sign with his name above hangs on the wall . A piano sits in one of the hallways that line the front and back of the house . If the gym and wrestling are not enough - there is also a full-size tennis court in the grounds .","The 8,300 square-foot mansion in Dorset, Vermont, has five bedrooms .

"Ray Cole, 69, was visiting Morocco when he was arrested on suspicion of homosexuality . A British holidaymaker has been jailed for four months in Morocco for being gay. Ray Cole, 69, from Deal in Kent had been visiting a Moroccan man in Marrakesh who he had met online when the pair were approached by police at a bus stop. Officers arrested Mr Cole and Jamal Jam Wald Nass on suspicion of being homosexual – a crime that carries a maximum three year sentence in the country. His family feared he had gone missing after losing contact with him for a nearly a week when he was arrested on September 18. He was eventually able to get in contact by ringing his home number – the only one he knew- from a fellow prisoner’s phone. The grandfather-of-one, who came out as gay a few years ago, spoke to his housemate and told him he had been arrested but did not know where he was. Mr Cole and Mr Jam Wald Nass were both sentenced to four months in prison on October 2. His son, Adrian Cole, 41, from Windsor in Berkshire, flew out to visit him and says the Moroccan authorities failed to notify them or the British Consulate of his arrest. ‘It's really rough, he's in with paedophiles and murderers and people who have committed shocking crimes,’ he told Pink News. ‘The Consulate tried to visit him but were initially turned way, and told he had refused to see them. But when we spoke to him, he didn't know anything about it. ‘He's had a couple of minor strokes before and has a minor heart condition. He has also been suffering with depression, which the court didn't take into account. ‘Why they haven't just deported him no one seems to be able to be able to explain.’ Adrian Cole, who works as a personal service manager for British Airways, added that his father was arrested for protecting Mr Jam Wald Nass, after meeting him online. He said: ‘He had been in Marrakesh for about four weeks and was due to fly home after five weeks. ‘He met Jamal online and they had been talking for a few months, and my father had already been on one two week holiday to see him. ‘They were standing waiting for a bus in Marrakesh to try to get back to Jamal's apartment in Gueliz when a policeman grabbed Jamal and started roughing him up. ‘We don't know if it was because some of the conservative neighbours near Jamal's apartment spoke to the police, or whether the police just wanted a bribe. ‘They took Jamal away from the bus and treated him poorly and my dad didn't walk away. He should have but he didn't. ‘It was then the police took Jamal's phone, which they didn't have the right to do, and they took his password and saw the picture.’ The Moroccan prison where Ray Cole is being detained with Jamal Jam Wald Nass after the pair were given a four month prison sentence on October 2 . He said they only realised there might be a problem when his sister Gemma Cole, 37, who lives in Minster in Kent, did not receive a text from her father on her birthday – the day after he was arrested. ‘We then noticed he hadn't posted on Facebook and he's usually quite proficient on there. We didn't panic straight away but by then we were quite concerned,’ he continued. ‘We called the police and reported a missing person. But on the 21st my dad called his housemate as his own number was the only one he could remember and he told him he had been arrested and didn't know where he was. ‘At first we popped champagne as we thought it was something minor, as before we thought he could be dead or something. Mr Cole, pictured while on his trip in Marrakech, had been in the country for four weeks and was due to fly home in five weeks . ‘Then we realised the gravity of it. We flew over there and visited my dad and he had a stoic British approach, he put on a brave face. But I know he is deeply disturbed.’ Mr Cole, a former publisher and volunteer with the elderly, had been married to his children’s mother Margaret for 45 years before he came out, but the pair have remained good friends. His family visited him in prison in Morocco but flew back on Friday following the sentencing and say they are planning to appeal his conviction. They added that he is being fed boiled vegetables once a day and his dorm, which is designed to sleep 44 men, is used by 60 – leaving him sleeping on a concrete floor. His son added: ‘He knows he committed a gay act on their soil, he gets that. But he should be deported back, putting a 70 year-old tourist in prison for that isn't sensible, you can't lock them up. ‘We're hoping something will be done about this as soon as possible. ‘We have been working with the Foreign and Commonwealth office, but of course they cannot change the law. ‘I'm gay and no one gave me any guarantees that I could go out and see my father. ‘People don't know how dangerous this place is. They're a tourist driven economy. ‘They rely on tourists like my father. They then decide to judge you and your life and may or may not treat you in this fashion.’ A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ‘We can confirm the detention of a British national in Morocco. We are providing consular assistance.’ Adrian took to Facebook to tell others about what had happened to his father, urging them to share his story. He posted: ‘Please share this with as many people as you can and let's make sure that the Moroccans think twice about the way they treat those who chose to contribute to their economy.’ Other campaigners have also taken to Twitter as well as Facebook to highlight the case. Using the #freeraycole hashtag, they are pleading for help from Stephen Fry, Clare Balding, Simon Pegg and Lord Alan Sugar. Ray Cole's niece Vicki Cole tweeted actor Ralf Little, saying: ‘@RalfLittle my 70 year old uncle has been sentenced to 4 months in prison in Morocco for being gay £FreeRayCole please RT’ Twitter user @Tallguy73 tweeted David Cameron, it read: ‘@David-Cameron What about Ray Cole? A UK man imprisoned in Morocco for being gay? Help him, he's part of the country you run. #FreeRayCole’.","Ray Cole, 69, had been visiting a Moroccan man in Marrkesh he met online .

"Entrusting the best man with your wedding bands can be a treacherous undertaking. One couple chose instead to leave their fate in the hands of technology, opting for a drone to deliver the rings during their recent wedding ceremony. At their nuptials in Mafra, near Lisbon in Portugal on September 27, bride and groom Hugo and Lara received their rings during their wedding vows by drone which was remotely driven by their friend Tim. High tech wedding: Couple Hugo and Lara had a drone deliver their wedding rings . Coming into land: The unpiloted vehicle flew down the aisle at their September 27 wedding in Portugal .

Tim drove the drone down the aisle to the alter, where fellow guests Ana and Pedro collected the rings from a box attached to the unpiloted vehicle and handed them over the bride and groom. It took some convincing for the couple to agree to the sci-fi approach, only agreeing to it five days before the ceremony. Helping hand: Wedding guests collected the rings from the drone . Caught on camera: The drone recorded the whole stunt during the ceremony . There was some last-minute panic as well, Tim reveals, with unscheduled rain forcing the wedding inside and some adjustments made to the drone to accommodate the indoor delivery.

"A former RAF navigator has become the Britain's oldest  person to have sex change surgery after NHS-funded operations. Ruth Rose, 81, of Newhaven, East Sussex, underwent the final stage of her gender realignment surgery in July after she started living as a woman four years ago. Ms Rose, who had been James - a father of three and grandfather of four, said she had always known she was living in the wrong body, and had started dressing up in secret while at school. New start: Former RAF navigator Ruth Rose, 81, (pictured right, as James, before her surgery) has become the eldest person in Britain to have a sex change operation . At 18, as James, she embarked on an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering and went on to join the RAF at 23. When she married in 1961, Ms Rose felt she could not tell her wife about her feelings, hoping instead that they would go away. The couple were married for 42 years and had three children, but after they divorced amicably 11 years ago, Ms Rose began to be more open about living as a woman - having previously been living as a man at home, but dressing up to see friends. Surgery: Ruth is the oldest in Britain to have the surgery, and her treatments and operation cost the NHS £4,000 . Family: Ms Rose, an activist and public speaker for charities like Age UK, says she is still close to her ex-wife, and says although her family tolerated her decision to live as a woman, they were shocked by the surgery . She started hormone therapy four years ago when she stopped attending events as a man, and decided to undergo the dramatic surgery after coming through an unrelated operation for a hip and knee replacement. 'My doctor had said I should have the gender ­transformation operation but I thought I was too old. I thought I had left it too late. But the surgeons wouldn’t have done it if they didn’t think I could go through with it,' the charity worker told the Sunday People. Ms Rose, an activist and public speaker for charities like Age UK, says she is still close to her ex-wife, and says although her family tolerated her decision to live as a woman, they were shocked by the surgery. Past life: At 18, as James, she embarked on an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering and went on to join the RAF at 23 before marrying her wife of 42 years in 1961 . People seeking to receive gender reassignment treatment, which usually involves hormone therapy and surgery, on the NHS must first see their GP. The doctor will then refer them directly to either a gender specialist, gender clinic or local mental health team for assessment. After at least 12 months of living as a woman and undergoing hormone therapy male-to-female patients are considered eligible for genital surgery. During this time, patients should present consistently, on a day-to-day basis and across all settings of life, in their desired gender role, including coming out to partners, family, friends, and community members. There is no requirement for the patient to have commenced a social role transition before a recommendation is made for hormone therapy. Facial feminisation surgery is not usually funded by the NHS. Male-to-Female genital surgery typically requires a hospital stay of about a week and a period of recuperation that can vary from a fortnight to two months. She is the oldest in Britain to have the surgery, with her treatments and the operation, which she had on the NHS, costing £4,000. The NHS Gender Services, which provide specialist assessment and treatment of Gender Dysphoria, are offered to people over 18, and there is no upper limit. To undergo such major irreversible procedures, NHS guidelines state that patients must be sufficiently physically fit. Their treatment is carried out on a case by case basis, according to their individual needs and situation. Ms Rose said she had spent five days in hospital for her surgery, which took around two months to heal. Addressing criticism she may face for having the procedure on the health service, she said: 'You get people who can’t keep slim or who smoke and have all the related health issues – but the NHS will still treat them.' Ms Rose said she did not have a full construction, and that at her age she did not see herself having a sexual relationship with anyone. As well as more noticeable physical changes, such as her bust and higher waistline, Ms Rose said she had found that some everyday activities had to be performed differently as a woman, such as doing up the buttons on a jacket, or picking up an item from the floor. And even her driving has been affected. 'I’m sure I’ve become much more like a woman in so many ways,' she said. 'I would never describe myself as a great driver – but now I’m forgetting to signal before I turn.' She said that undergoing hormone treatment had also changed her outlook on life. She added: 'I have never been abused by anybody about this and I wouldn’t expect to be. We are not freaks to be on show and it is so nice to be part of a community in the gender that I feel is right.'","Ruth Rose, 81, had been James, a father of three and grandfather of four .

"David Walter, of Wroxham, Norfolk, died as he dashed to help others in the sea at Murcia in south-eastern Spain . A retired British police officer has died after rushing to help swimmers in trouble off the Spanish coast. Watersports enthusiast David Walter is thought to have drowned when he dashed to help others in the sea at La Manga in the Murcia region of  south-eastern Spain. The 67-year-old, who served with Norfolk Police for 30 years, was in Spain with his wife Mel, 53, after they had travelled all over Europe in their caravan for the last two years. No-one else is thought to have been injured or killed in the tragedy on Monday. His wife was said to be devastated last night as tributes poured in for the popular ex-policeman. Close friend Terry Hughes said Mr Walter had spotted a group of people struggling in the water and selflessly jumped in - but got into difficulty himself. Mr Hughes said: 'Dave died doing what he did best - helping people. I wouldn't expect anything different of him. 'He would go out of his way to help other people whether it was people he knew or didn't know.' He said Mr Walter and his wife, who used to live in Wroxham, Norfolk, had wanted to travel following his retirement. They had spent much of the past couple of years in a caravan abroad. Mr Walter had also been a kayaking instructor with local scouts. Chief Constable of Norfolk Police Simon Bailey said today: 'Our thoughts are with Dave's family at this very difficult time. 'I knew him personally when he was a member of the constabulary and he had a very successful career as a detective within CID until he retired in 2000. 'The fact that Dave put his life on the line to help save someone else reflects the type of officer and person I knew he was.' Mr Walter spent much of his police career on traffic and as part of the stolen vehicle investigation branch of CID. Paul Ridgway, chairman of Norfolk Police Federation, said Mr Walter would be 'greatly missed'. Helen Wickens MBE, secretary of the Norfolk branch of the National Association of Retired Police Officers (NARPO) and office manager of Norfolk Police Federation, said: 'Dave was a member of NARPO and it was really sad to hear the tragic news of one of our members. 'In his retirement from the service he had done a great many things and was clearly out in Spain doing something he had always loved because he loved to travel. It's just a tragedy.' The pensioner was also an examiner with the Norfolk and Norwich branch of the Institute of Advanced Motorcyclists (IAM). Today branch secretary Martin Woodhouse said: 'He was an examiner for IAM for many years and we're sorry to hear the bad news. The retired police officer drowned after rushing to the aid of swimmers in trouble off the Spanish coast at La Manga (pictured) in the Murcia region of Spain . 'Dave gave his time in lots of things and he was very supportive in what we did in the road safety field. 'He will be sadly missed for all the help and support he gave us.' Mr Walter was also involved with Norfolk Advanced Motorcyclists (NAM) and a volunteer cyclist instructor with Norfolk County Council (NCC). Iain Temperton, the council's team manager of casualty reduction, tweeted: 'Sad to hear that NCC volunteer cyclist instructor, Dave Walter, has drowned off the coast of Spain. 'Our heartfelt sympathy to his family.' A British funeral director based in Murcia said his body would be returned to the UK. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Murcia, Spain on 27 October, 2014. 'We stand ready to provide consular assistance.'","David Walter thought to have drowned after rushing to help swimmers .

Terror: Nate, left, only survived after stifling the urge to scream after being shot through the jaw and playing dead when Jaylen, right, ran amok in the school cafeteria . Recovery: Nate (with Jaylen, left) is now walking and talking after his ordeal but still faces surgery on Thursday . Gunman Jaylen, who was Nate's cousin and best friend, was sitting with his friends at the school cafeteria during the lunch break last Friday when the 15-year-old suddenly opened fire with a handgun, killing two girls and injuring three others. Homecoming prince Jaylen then turned the gun on himself as desperate students fled to safety following the massacre. Police revealed on Monday that Jaylen had lured his victims to the ambush via text message. Nate is still recovering at the intensive care unit at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle but earlier Monday took to Facebook to update his friends. He said he was 'grateful to be alive' after his condition was officially upgraded from serious to satisfactory. Nate's grandfather, Donald Hatch, told MailOnline his grandson was 'walking and talking' but was still in recovery. Victim: Gia Soriano (pictured) died on Sunday from her injuries in the shooting at Marysville-Pilchuck High School . Love triangle? Fryberg's crush Zoe Galasso (right) died at the scene. He had allegedly become heartbroken when she started dating his cousin Andrew Fryberg (left). Andrew is still in critical condition at the hospital . Ordeal: Shaylee Chuculnaskit (left) remains hospitalized from her injuries after Jaylen, right, shot her . 'He's getting along good, he's walking and talking which is great,' he said. 'Out of all of them he's in the best shape and we're all grateful for that. 'He was shot in the jaw and it shattered in a couple of places and the bullet came through his neck and hit his shoulder. But he's as good as he could be, I can't believe how fast he's healing.' Mr Hatch said surgeons plan to operate on Nate's jaw this coming Thursday. But tragically doctors have told Nate he won't be able to play his beloved football ever again. 'They told him he can't play any football any more, he's just finished with the football season and he's done,' said Mr Hatch. 'Obviously he's devastated about that. If somebody hits him good it will shatter his jaw. 'He was a defensive safety as well as running back, he loved to play and enjoyed hitting, but that's why he can't play. 'He played in the same team as Jaylen and Andrew who was also shot.' But Mr Hatch said it isn't Nate's injuries that the family is worrying about, it's the emotional scarring he will likely suffer. Forgiveness: Nate, pictured here at age 10, sent out tweets forgiving Jaylen. Family members said they were inseperable before the shooting . He said: 'Nate has been getting nightmares as you'd expect, that's what we're worried about, it is the emotional trauma what will need healing.' Mr Hatch says the family, including Nate, are still looking for answers over the shooting. The family has heard several theories including a feud over a girl and a row over football. Nate's mom Denise and his two sisters are currently at Nate's bedside in hospital as he recovers. Mr Hatch said: 'Nobody yet knows what happened and why. Nate was just sitting at a table and the guy got up and started shooting. 'He was sitting right across the table from him when he was shot. He was very lucky, everyone else got shot in the head, Nate was shot in the head but it was a glancing shot. He's a lucky kid. 'When he was on the ground he played dead, he just lay there until it was over.' Mr Hatch, 75, said Nate's memory of the incident is slowly coming back. He said the teen had written some notes to his family and in one it read: 'Grandpa, I still have a bullet in my chest'. Mr Hatch added: 'I think Nate's getting his memory back. And it kind of broke his heart to hear what happened. He said, ""why would my brother shoot me,"" even though they're cousins. ""Why would my brother do that to me?"" They were like brothers, they were so close.' Scarred: Nate's grandfather, Don Hatch, told MailOnline: 'Nate has been getting nightmares as you'd expect, that's what we're worried about, it is the emotional trauma what will need healing' Overcome: Nate's mother, Denise Hatch-Anderson (with her son above) has been 'hysterically crying' Amazingly Nate even took to Twitter from his hospital bed to forgive his best friend Jaylen. He wrote: 'I love you and I forgive you jaylen rest in peace' where he is being treated for a gunshot wound to his jaw. Nate and Jaylen grew up together in the Native American Tulalip tribe along with Andrew Fryberg, 15, another brother-like cousin who is in a critical condition in Harborview Medical Center following the attack. Nate's aunt Paula Sateiacum told MailOnline that the three boys were 'inseparable'. She said: 'They were like triplets. When you see one, you see all three. They did sports together, they did cultural stuff together, they were neighbors, all living within a block apart.' Paula remembers Nate being brought home recently by the police after he and Jaylen had got in to trouble after riding quads bikes. 'That was the last I time I saw the boys together. They were bombing all around, on the main roads too, they were being boys. They were best friends.' She added: 'It's amazing news that Nate is pulling through. The whole thing has been scary for the family. My older sister Denise is devastated, she was hysterically crying.' It was revealed at the weekend that high school student Gia Soriano had died as a result of her injuries. She was the second person to be confirmed dead as a result of the shooting after Zoe Galasso last week. Their classmate and friend Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, remains in critical condition in intensive care at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. Remembrace: Francesca Tuazon, 17, left, and Nicole Buell, 17, right, bring flowers and balloons to the growing memorial on Monday . Since the shooting, it has emerged that Jaylen was left heartbroken after Zoe rebuffed him for his cousin Andrew. In an ominous indication of the anger that spurred his deadly tirade, Jaylen tweeted last month: 'Dude. She tells me everything. And now I f***ing HATE you! Your no longer my 'Brother'!' Friends say it was a reference to Andrew, 15, dating Zoe. Earlier today police revealed that high-school freshman Jaylen had invited his victims to the cafeteria ambush by text message. Fryberg did not leave behind a note and investigators are still combing through text messages to determine a motive. 'I don't know if the why is going to be something we can provide,' Snohomish County Sheriff Ty Trenary said. But he said it was clear from the initial investigation that Fryberg targeted the victims. 'We know that the shooter had arranged to meet with friends at the lunch table,' he said. 'It's our understanding he did so by texting.'","Nate Hatch, 14, was shot by his cousin and best friend Jaylen Fryberg .

"Harry Potter author JK Rowling is to build her own 'Hagrid Hut' in the grounds of her Scottish estate. The writer plans to install the stone-built summerhouse on the edge of the 19th century 162-acre Killiechassie estate near Aberfeldy, Perthshire. Rowling bought the house and grounds for £1.9million in 2001 and married husband Dr Neil Murray in the library in the December of that year. Scroll down for video . JK Rowling has applied to build a stone summerhouse (plans, left) in the grounds of her home, which has been compared to Hagrid's hut in the Harry Potter books and films (right) The Harry Potter author is pictured with her husband Dr Neil Murray. The couple married at the estate . The application was approved by council planning officials last week. Local authority documents show the author's vision of the structure, which bears a striking resemblance to the home of one of her most well-loved characters, Hagrid. It will be a circular structure, open to the front, with a stone bench and slate roof. Like the home of her fictional character - played by Robbie Coltrane in the Harry Potter films - the structure is also set on the edge of a forest. The building is similar to fictional home of Hagrid, the Hogwarts caretaker made popular by Robbie Coltrane . The application has been approved by the council, as long as no trees are felled in its construction . Rowling bought the house and grounds in the beautiful Highlands location for £1.9million in 2001 . A council report states that the condition of the application's approval is that no trees must be damaged or cut down during the construction. Rowling has previously built similar tree-house structures in the grounds of her Edinburgh mansion. The inter-connected tree houses are thought to have been built for her two youngest children. Built on wooden stilts, the tree house features lanterns above the doors, balconies and carvings. Also built into the structure were a spiral staircase and a trapdoor. Her retreat has its own small loch, said to contain a murderous water sprite.","Author plans stone-built summerhouse for the grounds of her estate .

"Retired Army Sergeant Noah Galloway, 33, of Alabaster, will be the first reader to ever appear on the cover of Men's Health magazine . An Alabama war veteran and double amputee is making Men's Health history as the first reader to appear on the magazine's cover, Men's Health announced Tuesday . Retired Army Sergeant Noah Galloway, 33, of Alabaster, will be the first reader to ever appear on the cover of Men's Health magazine after winning the publication's first 'Ultimate Men's Health Guy' contest.   Guy' contest. Galloway beat out more than 1,200 men in the magazine's search for 'a guy who personified the spirit of Men's Health,' according to Men's Health magazine. When Galloway was named one of the contest's three finalists, he told Men's Health that, if he won the contest thus appearing on the cover, he hoped it wouldn't be because he was injured. 'To me, they're putting a reader on the cover, so it's more of the average man, Galloway said. 'He's not going to be bigger than life. Men's Health sees that man as relatable. ""To feel like I'm relatable to all the readers—that's some big compliment."" Earning his title as the 'Ultimate Men's Health Guy,' Galloway has had to overcome ultimate hardships. The father-of-three was serving as an infantry soldier in Iraq Dec. 19, 2005 when his humvee set off an IED in Yusafiah, Iraq resulting in the loss of his left forearm and left leg below the knee as well as several injuries to his remaining leg and jaw, according to the Noah Galloway website. Attack:  Galloway lost his left leg and forearm during an IED attack in Yusafiah, Iraq . After the injury, Galloway went into a deep depression, he told Men's Health. Galloway said he would sit at home drinking, smoking, and sleeping all day. 'I thought, more than a few times, that it would've been better if I had just died,' Galloway said in a Men's Health interview. 'I'd have been looked at like a hero, but instead, I had two of my limbs taken from me.' In 2010, facing physical devastation and depression, Galloway decided to end his pity party and make a change. He joined a 24-hour gym and slowly regained his confidence, leaving his depression behind. Depression: After his injuries, Galloway went into a deep depression where he would sit at home all day drinking, smoking, and sleeping . Children: Galloway told Men's Health that his depression affected his relationship with his children . Triumph: Galloway overcame his depression and became a runner and personal trainer participating in many marathons and events . He went on to participate in many events such as: the 2012 Marine Corps Marathon, Three Warrior Dash events, seven Tough Mudder events, a Barbarian Challenge, six Spartan events, the Spartan Death Race (which he completed), the Bataan Death March Marathon, three Crossfit competitions, and several 5K and 10K races. He is also a member of Operation Enduring Warrior -- a non-profit veteran support group. And now, to his list of accomplishments, he can add being on the cover of the world's largest men's magazine. Men's Health has a global readership of more than 35 million, according to Rodale. Fund: His triumphs led him to creating the 'No Excuses Charitable Fund' -- a donation-based fund aiming to provide assistance to local organizations focused on reducing childhood obesity in Alabama . 'I do know the difference of going from living a life of being miserable and out of shape and how that can turn around completely just by being healthier,' Galloway said in the Men's Health interview. 'Being a personal trainer and being injured,' Galloway continued, 'I take people's excuses away. Whatever it is that you tell me that you can't do, I'm like we can find something to get it done.' His recovery and triumphs led him to creating the 'No Excuses Charitable Fund' --  a donation-based fund aiming to provide assistance to local organizations focused on reducing childhood obesity in Alabama.","Retired Army Sergeant Noah Galloway, 33, is the first reader to appear on the cover of Men's Health magazine .

"At least 1,000 people will be summoned as potential jurors for the trial of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a federal judge said today. Tsarnaev, 21, is charged with carrying out the April 2013 attack that killed three people and injured more than 260. He has pleaded not guilty and could face the death penalty if convicted. The former University of Massachusetts student is accused of planting two bombs near the marathon finish line with the help of his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who later died in a shootout with police. Judge George O'Toole Jr said he expects a pool of 1,000 potential jurors to be called in to fill out questionnaires for Tasarnaev's case to ensure that an impartial jury can be picked. Scroll down for videos . Boston Marathon bombing suspect: At least 1,000 people will be summoned to pick a jury for the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (pictured), a federal judgesaid today. They will be whittled down to 100, then 12 . Attack: Tsarnaev is charged with carrying out the April 2013 attack that killed three people and injured more than 260. He allegedly planted two bombs near the marathon finish line. Above, one of the bombs explodes . They will then be being whittled down to around 100, who will be questioned individually. Finally, the jury of 12 jurors and six alternates will be chosen from the group. ''It's kind of a rolling admission policy,' O'Toole told USA Today. Earlier this year, defense attorneys petitioned O'Toole to relocate the suspect's trial on the grounds that sourcing impartial jurors in Boston would be impossible. But the judge ruled  that the trial would go forward in the city despite the widespread impact of the bombings, saying the area is large enough to generate a sufficient pool of qualified jurors. Clear-up: Officials dressed in white all-in-one suits remove debris from the street following the bombing . Spotted at the scene: Judge George O'Toole Jr said he expects a pool of 1,000 potential jurors to be called in to fill out questionnaires for Tasarnaev's case.  Above, Tsarnaev walks in Boston on the day of the attack . Speaking during a status conference in U.S. District Court today, O'Toole said jury selection is scheduled to begin on January 5. But he added that it could be delayed by one day if there are juries for other trials being picked on that date. Tsarnaev, who was pictured wearing a white baseball cap at the scene of the bombing, is being held in a federal prison while awaiting trial. He did not attend Monday's status conference. However, seven protesters stood outside the courthouse holding placards challenging the case against him. One of them, Karin Friedman, called the evidence against Tsarnaev 'flimsy'. Arrest: Tsarnaev, pictured holding his hands up at the time of his arrest, is being held in a federal prison . Another woman who identified herself as the mother-in-law of Ibragim Todashev, who was shot by the FBI while being questioned about Tsarnaev's brother, Tamerlan, was also stood outside. The woman, named Elena Teyer, said she drove two days from her home in Georgia to reach the courthouse. She was holding a placard with photos of Todashev, alongside the words: 'I am dead because I knew Tsarnaevs. I knew the truth.' Todashev was killed in May 2013 - around a month after the bombings on April 15 - while being questioned about a triple slaying in Waltham in 2011. Another accused: Tsarnaev is accused of planting the bombs with the help of his brother Tamerlan (pictured, left, and, right, on the day of the high-profile bombing). Tamerlan later died in a shootout with police . Federal authorities have said that Todashev implicated Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the triple slaying. Authorities cleared the agent, saying Todashev had charged at a Massachusetts state trooper. Tsarnaev, who is legally allowed to skip pre-trial hearings, has missed every one since his arraignment in July 2013. His attorneys, alongside prosecution lawyers, will be back in court at least twice before the trial begins. Status conferences are scheduled for November 12 and December 18.","At least 1,000 people will be summoned in case of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev .

"Count on a pack of wily coyotes to help catch a sneaky criminal. Daniel Rice, 21, was being held in an Iowa jail a week ago on charges of theft, burglary and criminal mischief when he was taken to a hospital in Muscatine to be treated for a heart condition. During his stay at Trinity Muscatine hospital last Monday, Rice somehow managed to slip out of handcuffs and took off on foot wearing only a flimsy hospital gown, which he later lost. Wanted man: Daniel Rice, 21, pictured left in his booking photo and right in a Facebook image, was arrested last week on theft, burglary and criminal mischief charges in Iowa, but was able to escape from custody . Great escape: Rice slipped out of handcuffs while being treated for a heart condition at Trinity Muscatine hospital . Wily coyotes: Two days after the escape, a 911 dispatcher in Illinois got a call from a man saying that he was being chased by 20-30 coyotes. Above is a file photo of the animals . Busted: Rice was located October 22 in Loud Thunder Forest Preserve in Illinois, 8 miles away from Muscatine . As sheriff's deputies in Muscatine, Iowa, were busy searching for the fugitive, officials in Illinois City, Illinois, located 8 miles away, got an unexpected call from a man saying that he was being chased by a large pack of wild coyotes, according to Muscatine Journal. The call was placed just after midnight on October 22 from Loud Thunder Forest Preserve by Rice, who gave the 911 dispatcher a false name, Zachary Turner, in a bid to conceal his identity, reported WQAD. On the 911 call, the fugitive said that he and another person were being pursued in the woods by 20-30 coyotes. 'I got a stick to defend ourselves,' the suspect told the 911 dispatcher. Rock Island County Sheriff’s deputies responded to the nature preserve and found Rice, whom they quickly identified as the Iowa fugitive thanks to a pacemaker scar on his chest.

"A Dallas nurse who recovered from Ebola will soon be reunited with her dog, which has been sequestered since his owner became ill. The King Charles Cavalier spaniel named Bentley is in quarantine at an abandoned Navy base in Dallas. His owner, Nina Pham, was diagnosed with Ebola earlier this month. She contracted the virus while caring for a Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, who died October 8. Scroll down for video . Ebola free: Bentley, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel belonging to cured Ebola patient Nina Pham, is expected to be released from 21-day quarantine on Saturday. Pictured above in a snap shared by Dallas Animal Services  on Thursday . Where's Nina? Pham has not been allowed to visit with her dog yet, since it could cause Bentley to become anxious. Pictured again on Thursday . Looking forward to a happy reunion: Pham contracted the disease after volunteering to treat U.S. Ebola patient-zero Thomas Eric Duncan. She has since recovered from the deadly disease. Pictured above giving a hug to President Barach Obama on October 24 . City spokeswoman Sana Syed said Thursday that the dog has tested negative for Ebola and that his 21-day quarantine — the Ebola incubation period — ends Saturday. Pham was released from her own quarantine on October 24. Syed says Pham won't visit the dog sooner because he may become anxious if he sees her but is then left behind in isolation. Pham was one of two nurses to contract Ebola after treating Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Nurse Amber Vinson has also been cured of the deadly disease which has currently claimed nearly 5,000 lives, mainly in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. That leaves only one person currently being treated for Ebola in the U.S. Dr Craig Spencer of New York is currently being treated for the disease in an isolation wing at Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital. He came down the disease less than a week after returning from West Africa where he was performing aid work with Doctors Without Borders. Ms Pham was the first Ebola patient in the U.S. to have been in contact with a pet as she came down with the virus. While dogs are not known to be the virus' natural carriers, it's still unclear whether they indeed spread it to humans if they've come into contact with someone who is infected. In Spain, those questions caused officials to put down the dog of nurse there who became infected. Nurse's best friend: Pham's beloved dog has been in quarantine since just after she admitted herself to the hospital with a high temperature . Under observation: Workers in hazmat suits removed Bentley from Pham's home, and took him to a special isolation room at a nearby naval base. He has been treated by veterinarians and other workers every day. On Thursday he tested negative for Ebola for a third time .","Bentley the dog was put into 21-day quarantine just after his owner Nina Pham was diagnosed with Ebola earlier this month .

"Whether he's rocking a man bun or crucifix earrings, there's no denying that Ollie Proudlock is the trendiest resident of SW3. So iconic has the Made In Chelsea star's look become that he channelled his style expertise into a clothing line, Serge DeNimes. The 25-year-old has unveiled his AW14 range and modelled it in an exclusive photoshoot for MailOnline. Scroll down for video . Style king: Ollie Proudlock from Made In Chelsea has unveiled his new AW14 collection and modelled it exclusively for FEMAIL . Speaking about the range, the designer said: 'I am extremely proud and excited to launch this AW14 collection. I feel that the brand has gone from strength to strength over the last three years, and this collection is a reflection of all the hard work that my team and I have put into making this our strongest collection to date. 'We have come a long way from starting as a T-shirt brand, and now our product range is not only larger but, having moved to a new factory, the quality is better than ever.' And it seems the fashion world is embracing his work. The trendy label is currently stocked in 38 stores within the UK - with plans to expand overseas to America, Asia and Australia - and is being worn by Rita Ora and Jourdan Dunn. 'Whether they are celebrities or not, for me it is always nice to see people with a strong sense of individuality and style wearing my clothes,' said Ollie of his fan base. 'That being said, I would love to see some Serge on three of my style icons: Pharrell Williams, Tinie Tempah and ASAP Rocky.' Get the look: Speaking about the range, the designer said he feels that the brand has gone from strength to strength over the last three years, and this collection is a reflection of all the hard work that he and his team have put in . Pensive: Ollie has become well-known for his trendy style and fans can emulate his look thanks to his clothing range, with T-shirts costing £40 and sweatpants costing £60 . Despite looking up to the singers, Ollie has become quite the trendsetter himself, mainly spearheading the man bun or 'mun', which he wears so well. So how can men pull off the mun? 'I think the key is to remember that it is a waiting game, i.e. don’t try and put it in a bun too early, as some people have done, as it just doesn’t look great,' advised Ollie. 'Just keep growing the top while keeping the back and sides trim. Then when the length on top is right, bun it up!' So Serge: Away from the sloaney show that sky-rocketed him to fame, Ollie has his sights set on success in the creative industry, perhaps in music or art . One cast member who is a fan of his mun is on-screen love interest, Lucy Watson. Fans of the E4 show were left stunned last Sunday when it was revealed that Lucy  had secretly been locking lips with co-star Proudlock - but it seems things may have fizzled out already. Speaking about his on-screen relationship, he said: 'We are good. People are asking a lot of questions about us, as the show is on air at the moment, but what the viewers are seeing, we filmed a while ago. Quite a lot has changed since then, so you will have to wait and see.' Despite the status of their romance, Ollie is a fan of Lucy's style. 'Lucy puts time into the way she looks, and it pays off as she always looks immaculate,' he said. Away from the sloaney show that sky-rocketed him to fame, Ollie has his sights set on success in the creative industry. 'In five years time, hopefully I'll still working within the fashion industry.

"Bryan Sotelo's mother can only watch while her son struggles to overcome a sickness that has paralyzed him in his arm and seems only to get worse. The 11-year-old was sick in July when Yadira Garcilazo took him to the hospital in Allen, where doctors diagnosed him with a cold and sent him home. A week later, his arm was paralyzed. 'I was completely scared when he told me the next day, ""Mom I cannot move my arm,""' Garcilazo told CBS DFW. Scroll down for video . Fighter: Melissa Lewis helps her son Jayden Broadway, 9, as he struggles with an enterovirus that has been especially severe in connection with his asthma . Now, according to the Dallas Morning News, Sotelo is undergoing physical therapy at Children's Medical Center Dallas and fighting to breath with a tracheotomy. In the midst of panic over Ebola, the Centers for Disease Control positively confirmed 10 instances of enterovirus-D68 in the Dallas area. It also confirmed there were 538 cases of the virus nationwide, in 43 states and the District of Columbia. But paralysis like Bryan's is a rare symptom of the disease, which normally causes mild to severe respiratory illness that can include fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough and body and muscle aches. Still, WHNT reports that one case of paralysis in Michigan was linked to the disease. Outbreak: The virus struck in 43 states, the District of Columbia and in 4 Canadian provinces, leading doctors to call for the development of a vaccine . Four children in Colorado tested positive for enterovirus after being hospitalized for paralysis, according to NBC. CBC is reporting that four cases of paralysis throughout Canada are also linked to enterovirus-D68. As of now, the CDC has not confirmed whether or not Bryan's tests have returned positive for the virus, though Dr Ben Greenberg, his attending neurologist at Dallas Children's is sure. 'Statistically, I bet it is,' says Greenberg, who has been monitoring Bryan since he was hospitalized with weakness in his arm in August. In recent weeks, conservative media outlets such as Breitbart have claimed a link between unaccompanied children immigrating over the U.S.-Mexico border and the enterovirus outbreak. The spread of the virus and the lack of confirmed cases in states such as Florida and Nevada, traditional destinations for Hispanic immigrants, makes a connection unlikely. Virus: The CDC reports that the enterovirus has been confirmed in 538 cases between mid-August and October 3, striking mostly children . One reason Greenberg says these cases are causing worry is because there is currently no known treatment to combat enterovirus. Doctors worry that the neurological problems caused by the virus could be long lasting, in the same way that paralysis symptoms from polio outbreaks were permanent. 'We need to develop a vaccine now before it does a lot of damage,' Greenberg says.","Bryan Sotelo went to the hospital in July, where he was diagnosed with a cold .

The 33-year-old Brazilian has been a big name in fashion for the last few years, featuring in high end magazines including Vogue, Vanity Fair and Love.

It was only when she became friends with the now-Givency head designer Riccardo Tisci while he was studying at St Central St Martins that Lea began to give any thought to becoming transgender. She later recalled in an interview with French Vogue: 'One night he encouraged me to wear pumps to a party. 'We went shopping for 'drag queen' shoes and we bleached my eyebrows. It was a revelation.' Lea then went on to become Riccardo's muse. In 2008, Lea started hormone replacement therapy and in 2012 underwent full gender reassignment surgery in Thailand.

Last year, a petition was started for Carmen to be included in the Victoria's Secret 2013 fashion show, but it was unsuccessful despite collecting more than 45,000 signatures. She told CNN about her the petition had affected her, saying: ' 'It's kind of like validation. 'No matter how insecure I might be, no matter how un-pretty I might feel, there are people out there who look to me to be strong and to keep going and to keep proving people wrong.'

"The father of Sabrina Allen, the 17-year-old girl who was went missing aged 4 and was finally rescued earlier this week, has said that his daughter was ‘not living a regular life’ during her 12 years in captivity. Greg Allen has yet to be reunited with his daughter Sabrina, who was rescued in Papalotla, Tlaxcala, near Mexico City, during a secret mission on Tuesday morning. 'She's in pretty bad shape, from my understanding,' said Allen as he became emotional speaking about his long lost daughter. Scroll down for videos . Safe: An image shows Sabrina Allen as a teenager - more than a decade after she was snatched by her mom, her father has described her 12 years in captivity as 'not living a regular life' Never giving up: Sabrina's father, Greg Allen (pictured), hired a private investigator to find his daughter and it was a tip sent to this PI last month that ultimately led to the girl's rescue . 'Sabrina has been under an intense campaign to hate me for 12 years. She's currently under the care of a therapist that specializes in cases like this.' As Allen waits anxiously to reunite with his daughter, he said he is already working to line up support that will help her get up to speed on everything she missed. 'She was not living a regular life,' he said. 'She has not been going to school.' In a video he posted to GoFundMe page on Wednesday, Allen said that Sabrina had been found with her blonde locks dyed brown. Her mother, Dara Llorens, had started dyeing her hair after she was kidnapped. Safe: The little girl, pictured as a child, was four years old when she was taken. Her mother dyed her blonde hair to escape authorities and moved around with her constantly to avoid being found . Emotional: In a video released on Wednesday, Sabrina's father Greg said that his daughter had been told that she didn't want him and that he had committed suicide. They have yet to be reunited . 'She was effectively a prisoner in a two-bedroom apartment,' he said. 'She has been told that I didn't want her and that I committed suicide. She was also told that both of my parents are dead.' On April 19, 2002, Llorens allegedly took her daughter for a scheduled weekend visit as part of a court-ordered child custody agreement. But she never returned Sabrina to her father, who was her primary guardian, at the end of that weekend, according to the FBI. Llorens, now 44 and pictured in her mugshot for the first time in more than a decade, has been charged with aggravated kidnapping. She is now in the custody of Austin authorities and is being held on a $300,000 bond. According to her ex-husband she had undergone 'extensive plastic surgery' in an effort to hide from investigators. Caught: Dara Llorens has been captured 12 years after snatching her daughter, then four, from Texas and fleeing to Mexico. Her ex-husband said she had undergone plastic surgery to elude authorities . Authorities said that Llorens had repeatedly moved around with her daughter, always fearful investigators or Greg Allen would catch up with them. Still, Sabrina is physically well and has dreams for the future, including becoming a ballerina, authorities said. 'I want to know her. She’s a completely different person, but they say personalities are formed by age five,' Allen told KVUE. '[I'm] hoping she has some memories still.' Allen, who has since remarried and has had more children, said that the 12-year search for his daughter had been a roller coaster filled with false leads. 'I was Ahab and the white whale. I was not going to survive,' he said. 'It's a long road. You don't know what the outcome is.' Snatched: Llorens allegedly took her daughter into Mexico after she was supposed to hand the child over to the custody of her father. Greg Allen said his ex-wife has apparently had plastic surgery to appear different . Apartment: They were found living in Papalotla, Tlaxcala near Mexico City and captured on Tuesday morning . The rescue came thanks to an anonymous tip sent last month to Private Investigator Philip Klein, whom Greg Allen hired nine years ago. After receiving the tip, Klein contacted state and federal authorities to confirm the identities of the woman and girl using facial recognition. After watching them for two weeks, agents swooped in. 'She put up quite a good fight,' Klein said of Llorens. 'There were minor injuries to one of the agents.' Greg Allen has stayed committed to the search over the past decade and the case has twice featured on 'America's Most Wanted'. Sabrina had also been listed as missing by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, while her mother was on the FBI's Most Wanted list. Llorens allegedly violated a court-ordered child custody agreement and disappeared with the child shortly after taking her on April 19, 2002, during a scheduled weekend visit. When she was supposed to return the girl two days later, she never did. Changed: When the girl was spotted, left, in Mexico City 14 months later, her mother had apparently dyed her blonde locks, right, dark brown. An image right shows what the family thought she might look like . Taken: Sabrina Allen, who is now 17, has returned to Texas and is being evaluated, her family said . The mother and her daughter were tracked down to Mexico City after 14 months but managed to get away from authorities. Pictures taken at the time showed the girl's blonde locks dyed brown. At the time, they were living under the assumed names Blanca Aurora Fabian Urieb and Adriana Fabian Uribe. They were last seen living there in June 2003. Last March, Greg Allen vowed never to give up looking for his daughter. 'I want to find her,' Allen told Fox7. 'I want to see her again. She needs to know she has a family that loves her. I can't just give up on her.'","Greg Allen has spoken out about the ordeal that his daughter has endured the past 12 years while living in captivity in Mexico .

"Experiencing different cultures and sampling local food is all part and parcel of travelling. And what's a holiday abroad without without trying out the local tipple? But alongside relatively harmless mixes like Spain's wine-based sangria and Sweden's fermented grain spirit Brännvin, sit some highly dangerous drinks. Indonesia for instance has arak, a potent rice liquor with 80 per cent alcohol content which when made into a cocktail, has lethal consequences. Cheers! A holiday cocktail is nice - but would you brave one of these eight most dangerous drinks? The drink, which according to Reuters caused the death of at least 25 people in 2009, is sometimes cut with methanol, which is highly toxic. And living up to its name, the Zombie, invented in the 1930s by Donn Beach, is so strong that staff at Hollywood's Don The Beachcomber restaurant restrict customers to two apiece. London has its own lethal liquid, too. The infamous Flaming Ferrari from South Kensington's Vietnamese restaurant and bar, Nam Long Le Shaker is said to floor its drinkers after three rounds. From Russia's Nicolashka and Chicago's vaportini to New Orleans's infamous Hand Grenade, these eight terrible tipples could leave their drinkers nursing more than just a sore head. Pretty but perilous: Lovely to look at and gorgeous on the tongue, the effect of drinking copious amounts of delicious concoctions can be felt the morning after . 1. Arak Attack, Bali . Made primarily from the strong tasting arak, a locally distilled rice liquour with a mixers including lemonade, Pepsi or orange juice, this drink is mostly found in the bars of Kuta beach in Bali. The lethal cocktail is a perilous drink, and in 2009, at least 25 people died from alcohol poisoning after drinking it. The rice liquor itself has a strong, fruity note and has to be mixed with flavours which have a stonger aroma, such as lemonade or orange juice. At 80 per cent proof, arak can sometimes be spiked with methanol, raising it to 140 per cent proof . An arak cocktail might cost anything from 8,000rp (41p), bought from a shack to 20,000rp (£1.03) purchased in a beach cafe. Arak: 80% proof, the rice liquor - when spiked with highly toxic methanol -can go up to 140%  proof . Beach bars: Arak Attack can mostly be found in the bars of Kuta beach in Bali . 2. Nicolashka, Russia . Typically an after-dinner drink, the Russian Nicolashka comprises a double shot of vodka, espresso powder, lemon and sugar. The concoction is consumed by first putting the lemon, sugar and coffee in the mouth, before taking one shot of vodka. The mixture is kept in the mouth and slowly chewed before being swallowed. The second shot of vodka comes swiftly after. It's a relatively simple drink but is strong, with drinkers claiming that keeping the alcohol in the mouth allows it to be absorbed faster into the blood stream. And while booze itself is said to slow the circulation, caffeine from the espresso, together with the vitamin C from the lemon, combine with the sugar to increase blood circulation, making the alcohol reach the brain swiftly. Citrus, sugar, coffee and vodka come together swiftly and cause an almost immediate effect . The Russian Nicolashka is rumoured to have been invented by Czar Nikolaus II . 3. Hand Grenade, New Orleans, US . Sold only in five licensed bars in the New Orleans French Quarter - Tropical Isle Original, Tropical Isle Original Papa Joe’s, Tropical Isle Bayou Club & Music Bar, the Funky Pirate, and the New Orleans Grapevine - this melon-flavoured drink was created by husband and wife team Pam Fortner and Earl Bernhardt in 1984. The $8 (£5) cocktail is usually served in a green plastic yard glass and includes equal parts gin, grain alcohol, melon liqueur, rum and vodka. Sweet and potent, the full recipe is a trade secret and bar employees and licences have to sign confidentiality agreements pledging not to reveal it. The melon-flavoured Hand Grenade was created by husband and wife team Pam Fortner and Earl Bernhardt . The drink is only sold in five licensed bars in the French Quarter of New Orleans . 4. Death In The Afternoon, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . A classic concoction of champagne and absinthe, this mind-blowing luxe cocktail was invented by Ernest Hemingway and is also called Hemingway Champagne. Relatively simple to make, the recipe's original instructions appear in 1935 cocktail book and were contributed by Hemingway himself, who wrote: 'Pour one jigger absinthe into a champagne glass. Add iced champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly.' The drink rarely appears in bar menus but can usually be ordered from Sky Bar Kuala Lumpur's bartenders for the princely sum of RM67 (£13). Death in the Afternoon: A classic concoction of champagne and absinthe, this mind-blowing luxe cocktail was invented by Ernest Hemingway . The drink rarely appears in bar menus but can usually be ordered from Sky Bar Kuala Lumpur's bartenders . 5. Vaportini, Chicago, US . A new trend to emerge in the Chicago drinking scene, customers don't actually drink this. Instead, they take in alcohol vapour directly into the bloodstream. Julie Palmer – former co-owner of Kiva Bar where the 'cocktail' is available – created the glass globes from which the spirits are inhaled. The globes are filled with a shot of liquor, and rest on top of a pint glass. The heat from a candle at the bottom of the glass turns the liquor into fumes, which 'drinkers' then inhale through a glass straw. Health experts however have warned against this practice as there is a high risk of alcohol poisoning with the inhalation method as it bypasses the body's natural defense mechanisms against alcohol poisoning. Customers don't drink a Vaportini. Instead they inhale the alcohol vapour directly  into the bloodstream . The 'drink' is available in Chicago's Red Kiva Bar and was created by former co-owner Julie Palmer . 6. Singapore Sling, Singapore . A south-east Asian cocktail, this long drink costs more than $26 Singapore dollars (£13) and was developed by a Hainanese bartender in 1915 at the Long Bar in Raffles Hotel, Singapore. Initially called a gin sling, the drink itself doesn't contain vast amounts of alcohol but the high sugar content makes it an intoxicating brew. According to DA Embury, author of cocktail tome the Fine Art Of Mixing Drinks, there are not two recipes alike published for the drink. Singapore Sling is still served in the hotel and contains two measures of gin, one of cherry brandy, one measure of herbal liqueur Bénédictine and is topped off with fresh pineapple juice. Gin, cherry brandy, herbal liqueur Bénédictine and fresh pineapple juice go into the drink . Singapore Sling was invented by a Hainanese bartender at Raffles Hotel in Singapore . 7. Flaming Ferrari, London, UK . The infamous haunt of city slickers in the the decadent eighties, Nam Long Le Shaker in Old Brompton Road, South Kensington serves the equally as infamous Flaming Ferrari, a fiery concoction of green Chartreuse, Curaçao, Woods 100 Navy Rum and Grand Marnier. The £19 drink arrives flaming at the table and is strong enough to floor the hardiest of drinkers. Word of warning: rumours abound of customers blacking out after drinking three so it might be best to stick just to the one. Fiery: Flaming Ferrari is a concoction of green Chartreuse, Curaçao, Woods 100 Navy Rum and Grand Marnier . Nam Long Le Shaker in Old Brompton Road, South Kensington serves the exceptionally strong Flaming Ferrari . 8. Zombie, California, US . A smooth, fruity cocktail originally served heated, the Zombie was concocted in the 1930's by Donn Beach, a restaurant owner in Hollywood. The cocktail's ingredients are a heavily guarded secret as Mr Beach was very cautious with his recipe. According to the original recipe, published in drinks book Sippin' Safari, the drink was made from three different kinds of rum, lime juice, falernum, Angostura bitters, Pernod, grenadine, and 'Don's Mix,' a combination of cinnamon syrup and grapefruit juice. The cocktail is so strong that Don The Beachcomber restaurants limit their customers to two Zombies apiece. The Zombie is a fruity cocktail made from three different types of run, lime juice, falernum, Angostura bitters, Pernod, grenadine, cinnamon syrup and grapefruit juice . The drink was was concocted in the 1930s by Donn Beach, a restaurant owner in Hollywood .","London's infamous Flaming Ferrari said to floor drinkers after three rounds .

"Air pollution from oil and gas wells in Utah is being linked to the deaths of 13 infants last year - a rate six times higher than the national average. But the midwife who raised the alarm about the possible link has been targeted by threats and vandalism because drilling has helped the area in question prosper and kept thousands of people employed since the 1940s. The city of Vernal has 12,000 oil and gas wells, and some scientists whose research focuses on the effect of certain drilling-related chemicals on fetal development believe it could be the reason for the spike in infant deaths. Thirteen babies died near the Unitah Basin in Vernal last year, something some scientists are suggesting could be linked to oil and gas drilling in the area 'have blinders on' Midwife Donna Young uncovered an upward four-year trend in infant deaths in the Uintah Basin, in northeast Utah. One in every 95.5 burials in Uintah County in 2010 was a baby, which increased to one in every 53 burials the following year. In 2012, the figure increased again to one burial in every 39.7 and last year it jumped to one in every 15. Heather Jensen, whose two infants sons, died in late 2011 and 2013, told The Denver Post: 'People like to blame stuff on that all the time, but I don't feel like it has anything to do with oil and gas. I just feel like it's a trial I was given,' In neighboring Colorado late last year, an unusually high number of fetal anomalies in Glenwood Springs, 175 miles away in Colorado, were reported to state authorities. Drilling was investigated as a possible cause, but the study found no connection. Concerns have also been raised in other areas of heavy drilling, but no spikes in deaths have been recorded and no conclusions have been reached. Susan Nagel, a University of Missouri School of Medicine researcher who is focusing her studies on fracking-fluid chemicals that affect hormones said she suspects there is a 'relationship' between drilling and the deaths in Utah. Medical studies have found that air pollution can harm embryos. Harmful chemicals like benzene, toluene and xylenes are released during drilling, and can cross the placental barrier and cause heart, brain and spinal defects. Dr Brian Moench, president of the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment said those not considering the link between air pollution and the deaths had their ' Dr Brian Moench, president of the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment, said establishing a conclusive link between drilling and baby deaths is complicated, but of the Vernal-area deaths, he said 'air pollution from drilling is a part of it'. Air pollution is often a combination of chemicals and particles, combined from multiple sources. In Vernal, diesel pickups and fracking rigs are commonplace, and spew out fumes; coal-fired plants sends plumes of smoke into the air, and oil field-support businesses, stretch for miles. A study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric administration recently showed dangerously high levels of ozone in the Uintah Basin around Vernal. And last winter the levels were recorded as being well beyond those set by the Environmental Protection Agency. The study pointed at the oil and gas industry.'I think we pretty clearly have an air-quality problem, but we try not to freak out,' said Seth Lyman, an air-quality researcher with Utah State University in Vernal. 'But I think there is a low probability (that) air quality is bad enough to impact infant mortality.' 'I think we pretty clearly have an air-quality problem, but we try not to freak out,' said Seth Lyman, an air-quality researcher with Utah State University in Vernal . Another factor being considered as possibly contributing to the deaths is an explosion east of Vernal in March, 2013 at a business that cleans fracking equipment, which sent debris over a half-mile area. Authorities in Vernal discounted the explosion as having any environmental impact. They've said those complaining about air quality in Vernal don't live there. The possible link was given some credence when the TriCounty Health Department decided to help with a study to investigate the baby death spike. Ms Young had taken her findings, compiled through obituaries, to Dr Moench. Epidemiologists are using birth and death certificates to test Ms Young's findings. The results are expected early next year. Pollution aside, the Uintah County isn't a healthy place. It ranks 24th of 27 Utah counties in health rankings, smoking rates are twice what they are in the rest of Utah, obesity is also an issue, as is heavy drinking. There are also a high number of teen mothers. Dr Moench said those not considering the connection 'have blinders on'. Ms Nagal has gathered samples in Colorado's Garfield County and is exposing pregnant mice to fracking fluids to investigate what if any impact they have on their offspring. Earlier research she showed babies born to mothers living within 10 miles of wells are at greater risk of congenital heart defects and neural tube defects.But other researches have discredits her research methods. Ms Young, who delivers a lot of babies for father's who work in the oil fields, now insists that all her pregnant patients use air and water filters. The study in Garfield County, was also sparked by concerns raise by midwives. The study looked at 22 cases and found no direct links to air pollution. A recent survey of Vernal residents indicated 85 per cent welcomed oil shale development, which is expected to get underway next year. More than 25,000 new oil and gas wells are proposed in the basin.","Air pollution from oil and gas wells has been linked to 13 deaths last year .

"Scotland's could have its own time zone under plans to move the UK to Central European Time. The campaign to shift the UK forward an hour, aligning the nation with most of Europe, is supported by a wide range of MPs, who claim the change would save lives on the road thanks to extra sunlight. Scotland has been opposed to the change in the past, but campaigners say Westminster could devolve powers allowing Scots to set their own time. Scroll down for video . Scotland could have a different time zone if the plans, which would see the rest of the UK move to Central European Time, are approved . The proposal, which has been submitted to William Hague, has been kicked into the long grass in the past because of a lack of Scottish support for shorter daylight hours and darker mornings. But Tom Mullarkey, chief executive of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said that allowing Scotland to stick with the norm while the UK changes time zone was a possibility. In a letter to Mr Hague, who is the leader of the Commons and is chairing a government committee on devolving powers to Holyrood, Mr Mullarkey said the change could save 80 lives and prevent hundreds of injuries. According to The Times, he wrote: 'Paradoxically, there seems to be more political resistance to this proposed change in Scotland, which stands to gain disproportionately from the initiative, although the majority of people in Scotland do not appear to be against it. 'However, In England, where the appetite for change is greater still, many more people are killed and injured because of the time zone misalignment that both countries suffer. 'It is the perceived resistance in Scotland that is causing so many lives to be lost and diminished across the UK, and this could be a prime opportunity for the two governments to make thier decisions on this issue independently.' Yesterday it was announced that the drink drive limit will be cut from 80mg in every 100ml of blood to 50mg from December 5 in Scotland, but not England and Wales . Edmund King, president of the AA, also backed the move, but said it would come with 'practical difficulties'. He said: 'Our view is that it would be best if it was changed in England and Wales to see the benefits and then the Scots can decide for themselves. 'It would be slightly awkward, though, if you had difference opening hours in Scotland and England. There might be practical difficulties.' The move is largely driven by road safety, which Scotland already assumes powers for. Yesterday Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill announced plans to cut the drink-drive limit north of the border by Christmas. The blood alcohol limit will be reduced from 80mg in every 100ml of blood to 50mg from December 5. It would bring Scotland in line with the rest of Europe, but would mean the limit is lower than that in England and Wales.","Scotland could have its own time zone under plans handed to government .

"Dallas calmly marked the end of its Ebola crisis on Friday when the last of the 177 people who were being monitored for symptoms of the deadly virus were to be cleared at midnight. It has been 38 days since Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas and officials expressed relief and resolve that they were prepared if anything similar - with its resulting panic, fear and constant media attention - ever happened again. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins called it an early Thanksgiving for the city. He said: 'It's a time to reflect on the sacrifices of our hometown health care heroes and the city, county, and school district employees that worked so hard, along with our state and federal partners, to keep us safe during the Ebola crisis.' Scroll down for video . 'Patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas 38 days ago. Everyone in the city has now been cleared with no symptoms of the deadly virus . Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas where Thomas Eric Duncan, the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the U.S., received care. Dallas calmly marked the end of its Ebola crisis today when the last of the 177 people who were being monitored for symptoms were to be cleared at midnight . Monitoring for the two nurses, Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, who contracted Ebola from Mr Duncan has ended. The final person to come off the monitoring list was a hospital worker who handled medical waste for one of the three Ebola patients, ABC reported. Also on the list of those monitored were people who shared home with the Ebola patients and  community workers. People deemed at risk of Ebola must be monitored for a 21-day incubation period, according to CDC guidelines. Ebola is not an airborne virus and it is only spread through contact with the blood, saliva and the other bodily fluids of a contagious person. About 50 people who returned to Texas from West African countries where the virus has killed thousands will remain under monitoring. Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola on September 30, sending officials scrambling and residents fearing the worst. He died on October 8 at Texas Presbyterian Hospital. Duncan's fiancee, Louise Troh, and three others were confined to their apartment where Duncan had been staying, before they were moved to private housing. Louise Troh, partner of the late Thomas Duncan, was one of the worst affected by Ebola quarantines. She lost her home and has had trouble finding a new place to stay . People panicked over the possible spread of the virus. Jenkins was criticized for entering the apartment to meet with Troh, despite public health experts saying it was safe. Some people refused to shake hands with strangers, and others kept children home from schools where Ms Troh's children attended. In the end, no one in the neighborhood was infected. The two people who contracted Ebola were nurses who treated Duncan; Nina Pham and Amber Vinson both have recovered. Government officials and the hospital have acknowledged missteps in their handling of the crisis, from initially letting Duncan leave the emergency room after his first visit with Ebola-related symptoms to allowing Vinson to fly commercial to Cleveland and back while she was self-monitoring. Vinson has also said in interviews that she didn't feel prepared to wear the protective equipment necessary to treat Duncan. The hospital has mounted a major public-relations campaign to apologize for its mistakes. Officials are also preparing an analysis of how it handled the Duncan case, to likely be published next year. And while much of the city can breathe a sigh of relief, those closest to Duncan say they're still angry about his medical treatment and how some have blamed him for bringing Ebola to the United States. With her old apartment torn apart by hazardous materials crews, Troh has had trouble finding a new place to live, as landlords fearful of the virus have refused to rent to her. Asked about Friday's milestone, Troh's thoughts were brief. 'Thank God,' she said. Nurses who cared for Mr Duncan, Amber Vinson (pictured left) and Nina Pham (pictured right with her dog Bentley), recovered from Ebola and are due to be given the all-clear at midnight .

But, perhaps to the disappointment of its more mature fans, the show has been given a 21st century makeover . Thunderbirds are Go! will return to the small screen on ITV in 2015 - 50 years after the classic programme featuring the exploits of International Rescue first screened. The series will 'affectionately pay tribute' to the classic show, created by Mr Anderson, who died in December 2012 at the age of 83. Producers say it will feature a 'whole new level of action-adventure animation for today's audience', with the five Tracy brothers piloting their 'incredible vehicles into impossible rescues across the globe'.

The series will star Rosamund Pike - of Pride and Prejudice, and Gone Girl - as Lady Penelope and original cast member David Graham who reprises his role as Parker. Other star voices will include Kayvan Novak (Fonejacker, Facejacker) as inventor Brains and Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Game of Thrones, Love Actually) voicing John Tracy. It is a co-production between ITV Studios and Pukeko Pictures in association with world-famous Weta Workshop, responsible for big screen hits such as The Lord of the Rings, and Avatar. Thunderbirds, created by Anderson and his second wife, Sylvia, was first broadcast in 1965. With the catchphrase 'Thunderbirds are go!' and featuring the secret emergency service run by the Tracy family, aided by London agent Lady Penelope and her butler, Parker, it enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in the 1990s. In 1966, Thunderbirds was made into a major feature film, Thunderbirds Are Go, which was followed by a sequel two years later, Thunderbird 6.

"Outspoken Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie has rejected a Liberal MP's invitation to visit a mosque because she is Australian and a Catholic. Liberal MP Craig Laundy invited Senator Lambie to his Western Sydney electorate on Saturday to visit one of the large number of mosques holding open days, saying she should familiarise herself with Islamic people. Her comments follow the controversial senator quizzing defence force top brass over the threat Ebola-infected suicide terrorists could pose to Australia and its military. Outspoken Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie has rejected a Liberal MP's invitation to visit a mosque because she is Australian and a Catholic . Turning down the invitation, Senator Jacqui Lambie said she wouldn't enter a mosque (pictured) because she was Catholic and religious . Liberal MP Craig Laundy (pictured) invited Senator Lambie to his Western Sydney electorate on Saturday to visit one of the large number of mosques holding open days, saying she should familiarise herself with Islamic people . Turning down the invitation, Senator Lambie said she wouldn't enter a mosque because she was Catholic and religious. 'It's not my moral upbringing. I'm Australian,' she told Sky News. After admitting Muslims were also Australian, she said she would not feel comfortable at a mosque. 'I'm certainly not going to go out there just because it's going to be a media blitz standing outside a mosque,' she said. 'It's just not my moral upbringing and I'm just not comfortable.' Opposed to the wearing of the burqa, the senator has spoken out against sharia law. She has previously said any Australian who supports sharia should not have the right to vote or get welfare payments. At a Senate Estimates hearing Wednesday morning, the Tasmanian senator asked Vice Chief of the Defence Force  Ray Griggs if the nation's enemies could launch an attack with the deadly virus, Ebola. Officials replied by saying there was no evidence we could come under attack from the hypothetical scourge. 'I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest that is a likely course of action': Senator Jacqui Lambie (left) and Australian Defence Force Vice Chief Ray Griggs faced off at a senate estimates committee hearing on Wednesday morning . The Ebola virus: The deadly ailment has killed 4500 people in West Africa, according to the latest World Health Organisation figures . Ms Lambie asked a series of questions about the ADF's readiness for Ebola at a Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee hearing on Wednesday morning . Not at risk: Vice Admiral Ray Griggs said it would be 'quite difficult' for a person to enter the country without showing Ebola symptoms, particularly given the nation's geographical isolation . Ms Lambie asked: 'Do you have any information to suggest that Australia's enemies could attack our country or military using the virus?' 'For example with suicide agents who are infected by the disease or who have access to bodily fluids containing the disease.' Ms Lambie, a former Army soldier, then pressed Vice-Admiral Griggs on whether the Defence Force had a contingency plan for the scenario. But Vice Admiral Griggs said there was no proof militants were capable of attacking Australia or its troops with Ebola. 'I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest that is a likely course of action,' he told the hearing. He said because of Australia's isolation, it would be 'quite difficult' for a person to enter the country without showing symptoms. LAMBIE: I was just wondering if I could ask a supplementary on Ebola, if that's OK. Thanks Mr Chair. Do you have any information to suggest Australia's enemies could use attack our country or military using the virus? For example with suicide agents who are infected by the disease or who have access to bodily fluids containing the disease. And what is your contingency plan to fight this? GRIGGS: Well, I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest that is a likely course of action. One of the things, Senator, that we have playing to our advantage is our geographic (sic) isolation. And that the length of time that it takes simply to get to Australia. And (with) the life cycle of the virus, it becomes very obvious relatively quickly how sick someone is. So I think the ability to inject someone into the country who is not showing symptoms would be quite difficult. LAMBIE: I'm just asking if you have a contingency plan. Because if you listen to one side of it, they can say this can take off 10,000 a week, it can hit people by 10,000 a week. I just want to know... Is there a contingency plan through the Defence Force to tackle the Ebola issue. Are your men and women protected? GRIGGS: Senator, our men and women are protected as anyone else in the country is. The response to that hypothetical situation would be the response to any outbreak of Ebola in Australia. Our health system has its preparations ready for the virus appearing in the country. LAMBIE: And so are the civilian doctors and civilian nurses that... I'm not sure the ratio between defence and civilian now within that medical corps... Are they prepared to fight the Ebola alongside the military? I'm not sure what their contracts are. So are they prepared - do they get to move out if they do not want to fight this if it hits? How big is the corps, the medical corps, within the armed forces, which is military? GRIGGS: I'll have to take the exact numbers on notice please. LAMBIE: Thank you. In recent months, Ms Lambie, elected to a six-year term in the Senate last year, has waded into a number of controversial issues including the debate surrounding the burqa and Australia's preparedness for the Ebola virus . Last week, Ms Lambie told Daily Mail Australia the 'If you don't love it, leave' slogan on this controversial singlet sold at Woolworths did not go far enough . 'Senator, our men and women are as protected as anyone else in the country is,' Vice Admiral Griggs said. Ebola has been a pet topic for Ms Lambie in recent weeks. Last Friday, Ms Lambie proposed the government set up 'M.A.S.H. style' mobile field hospitals to fight Ebola as part of a virus-fighting 'action plan'. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), around 10,000 people could die of the virus each week if it is not brought under control. More than 4500 people have died in the three worst hit West African nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, WHO figures said. While there have been a number of scares at Australian hospitals in recent months - including the case of volunteer Red Cross nurse Sue Ellen Kovack - no Australian has reported an infection.","PUP senator Jacqui Lambie has rejected a liberal MPs invitation to visit a mosque .

"Women do not want to 'have it all' in life, they just want what men have, Miriam Clegg has claimed. The high-flying lawyer, married to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, insisted she wanted to be able to combine a successful professional life with having a family. Mrs Clegg said she makes sure her husband does his share of the chores, with one of them making sure they are at home every evening for their three sons. Miriam Clegg insisted she does not want to 'have it all', but wants to be able to combine a successful career with family life . Mrs Clegg attended an 'Inspiring Women in Scotland' event at New College in Kirkintilloch, Lanarkshire as her husband hosted his party conference in Glasgow . In a surprise intervention at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mrs Clegg spoke about how she juggles her career with raising her children, Antonio, Alberto and Miguel. With a successful career in her own right as a lawyer, marriage to the Deputy Prime Minister and three young children, Mrs Clegg, 46, is often seen as living proof that women are able to 'have it all'. But speaking to Sky News, she made clear that the decision to choose Mr Clegg as her husband and father of her children was more important to her than any lifestyle aspirations. And she said she had been fortunate to be able 'naturally' to find a way to share household chores and childcare duties with her politician husband. Spanish-born Mrs Clegg was speaking during a visit to a Glasgow college to address female students as part of the Inspiring Women campaign to enable girls to meet successful women from all walks of life who can act as role models. Asked whether she was able to provide the girls with an example of how women can 'have it all', Mrs Clegg told Sky News: 'I never understand what people mean when they say 'having it all'. I personally have never wanted to 'have it all' as a general aim. I just want to have what men have. 'Lots of men have a successful professional life - or what looks like success to them - and they fit it together with a family and that is what I want to have. 'There will be other women who don't want that. It is different for different women and different men. 'But childcare is an issue, obviously. And I think that, as (Facebook chief operating officer) Sheryl Sandberg said, the most important decision of your life is who you decide to have children with.' Mrs Clegg said she makes sure her husband Nick does his share of the household chores, and they try to make sure one of them is at home each evening for their sons . Nick and Miriam Clegg visited Castehill Primary School in Glasgow . Nick Clegg has looked to his wife Miriam to help the Lib Dems in the 'fight of our lives' to stay in power. The Lib Dem leader admitted his party faces a tough battle to cling to office after the general election in May, but insisted he would set out red lines for entering a new coalition with either the Tories or Labour. Asked if he would rather get into bed with David Cameron or Ed Miliband in a new power-sharing deal, Mr Clegg joked 'it's Miriam every single time', as he was joined by his wife for a photo opportunity in a school yesterday. She made clear that the Deputy Prime Minister was ready to share housework with her, and said they tried to ensure that at least one of them was home with the children every evening. 'There are lots of couples who share more and more (housework), there are lots of men now who are fully engaged with raising the children,' she said. 'If you look across society and across different countries, certainly in the Western world, women still get a very big proportion of the chores at home and I certainly know lots of women who before they leave to go to work have done half a day's work at home, and when they get home there is the other half to do. 'That doesn't happen to me. It is not an issue for people like you and I who can get help. It is an issue for those who can't get help, who don't have the money or circumstances to get help. Asked whether she had worked out in advance with her husband what compromises they would have to make to combine two high-flying careers with a family life, she said: 'Life is all about compromises. 'There is always a certain equilibrium and in my case, we found it naturally, but I do understand that there are people who plan. I'm just not very good with plans. 'We tend to share it very naturally. We make a point of one of us being home most evenings and on the whole we manage.' Mrs Clegg said she had not suffered from open sexism in her professional life, and felt it was important to give girls the self-confidence to aim high in the world of work. 'I think we have made a lot of progress, but there is still a little bit more progress to make,' she said. 'I think it is good for the girls to see the many options that are available for them. 'I haven't come across open discrimination against me. In terms of a little hidden sexism, I think there are lots of women who do face that.' Mrs Clegg yesterday joined her husband on a visit to Castlehill Primary School, Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire . Mrs Clegg said that when speaking to young women around the UK, 'something I have really noticed that I don't see so much from boys is we get lots of questions about self-confidence'. She added: 'I wonder if there is something a little bit specific to girls there, and in particular in relation to certain subjects - science subjects. 'I do think it is important to celebrate female achievement and aiming high as part of the lesson we want to give to the girls that aiming high is as good for girls as it is for boys.' Asked if she would give her sons different advice to that which she offers girls, Mrs Clegg said: 'Not necessarily. I go on with my boys about how you have to make an effort and everything really depends on you. 'If you really want to summarise what I hope that at the end of the whole educational process they would retain, I hope it is that.' Unlike her husband, she was seen wearing only two different outfits yesterday. Mrs Clegg chose jeans, shoes from Zara and a red printed top from Spanish brand Dolores Promesas for a visit to a school. She later changed into a beige dress and bright orange shoes for her husband's question-and-answer session.","High-flying lawyer talks about combining a career with family life .

He added: 'This expands the screening initiated at Heathrow last week, which is going well. Manchester and Birmingham airports will follow in the coming weeks. 'We are also providing all general practices, emergency departments, and pharmacies in England with awareness posters from this week. 'Public Health England will continue to consider other appropriate additional measures.' Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at PHE, said: 'Anyone who is well but may have been at increased risk of contact with the Ebola virus will be given printed information and a PHE contact number to call in case they develop symptoms. Temperature checks: A health official uses a thermometer at the arrivals hall of the airport in Lagos, Nigeria . 'People infected with Ebola can only spread the virus to other people once they have developed symptoms, such as a fever. 'Even if someone has symptoms, the virus is only transmitted by direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. 'It’s important to remember this is just one part of the screening process. PHE is also working with the international community and local health authorities to ensure robust exit screening remains in place at airports in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, which will pick up anyone who is symptomatic before they leave these countries. Form: A copy of the questionnaire for passengers who have travelled from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia . 'Although no system can completely prevent a case of Ebola coming into the UK, enhanced screening in high volume ports of entry will ensure that individuals at risk know exactly what to do if they start feeling ill, and can receive the expert advice they need immediately. 'Overall the risk of Ebola in the UK remains low, and we have a world-class domestic health system that is ready to respond if we do see a case in the UK.' Passengers arriving from Britain from high-risk areas are being subject to screening at Heathrow. They are being asked to complete a questionnaire asking about their current health and where they have come from. As well as personal details, including name, nationality, address in UK and phone number they have been asked: . The screening is taking place for passengers that Border Force officers identify as having travelled from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Passengers will have their temperature taken and complete a questionnaire asking about their current health, recent travel history and whether they might be at potential risk through contact with Ebola patients. Based on the information provided and their temperature, passengers will either be given advice and allowed to continue their journey, or undergo a clinical assessment by PHE staff and if necessary be taken to hospital for further tests. The UK and the US have both introduced screening measures in response to the threat from Ebola, which has killed more than 4,500 people in West Africa. It is believed that new screening procedures at Gatwick airport will affect passengers on about seven flights throughout the day. The Department of Health estimates that 85 per cent of all arrivals to the UK from affected countries will come through Heathrow airport, where testing began last week. The testing descended into chaos on its first day however, after people flying to the UK from high risk countries revealed the checks are not compulsory. But travellers at Terminal 1 this morning said the system is a 'complete joke' because they were either not checked at all, told it was optional or had to seek out medical staff themselves. Passport control: Based on the information provided and their temperature, passengers will either be given advice and allowed to continue their journey, or undergo a clinical assessment by PHE staff and if necessary be taken to hospital for further tests . Avoid direct contact with sick patients as the virus is spread through contaminated body fluids . Wear goggles to protect eyes . Clothing and clinical waste should be incinerated and any medical equipment that needs to be kept should be decontaminated . People who recover from Ebola should abstain from sex or use condoms for three months . After the complaints the Department of Health confirmed that screening travellers at major entry points into UK is not mandatory unless they 'show symptoms of the virus'. This was despite warnings from the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said that it was essential for airline passengers from West Africa to be checked for symptoms 'to make our country safe' and warned the epidemic could be as deadly as Aids. Mr Hunt also warned Britain should expect up to ten cases by Christmas as screening of passengers from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, where 4,000 have died from Ebola, started at Heathrow.","Tests to begin at North Terminal today and South Terminal from tomorrow .
Six months of Ebola screening planned in UK at a cost of £9million .

"The mother and father of a eight-year-old boy who allegedly died of scurvy will no longer face criminal charges, prosecutors  said today. Julie Seabridge, 46, and her husband Glynn, 47, had faced trial amid accusations of child neglect following the death of their son Dylan in 2011. But Swansea Crown Court heard today that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided to drop the case against the Pembrokeshire couple following a 'detailed review'. Julie Seabridge, 46, and her husband Glynn, 47, pictured outside Swansea Crown Court after the CPS dropped the case against them over the death of their eight-year-old son Dylan . District Crown Prosecutor for Wales Iwan Jenkins said Mrs Seabridge was too unwell to stand trial while saying it was 'not in the public interest' to pursue the case against Mr Seabridge. 'We have recently concluded a detailed review of the prosecution case against Glynn and Julie Seabridge, in relation to the tragic death of their son Dylan,' he said. 'Due to the very complex and serious nature of this case, expert advice and guidance has been sought from a number of sources by both the prosecution and defence teams. The case against the parents was dropped after lawyers concluded Julie Seabridge was too ill to stand trial and it would not be in the public interest to pursue proceedings against her husband . 'Taking account of the very many factors involved, it is our view that Julie Seabridge is unfit to face criminal charges on health grounds. 'In relation to Glynn Seabridge, our conclusion is that it is not in the public interest to pursue a prosecution against him. 'There are a number of public interest factors weighing against the need for a prosecution of Mr Seabridge in this case. 'These are related to concerns about his health and the likely effect of a prosecution on him, as well as the nature of the case and the likely penalty that a court would impose in the event of a conviction.' The couple denied any wrong doing and claimed that Dylan had a medical condition which meant he wasn't getting enough vitamin C. The CPS added its decision did not 'imply any finding concerning guilt or criminal conduct'. Mr Jenkins added: 'The CPS makes decisions only according to the test set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and it is applied in all decisions on whether or not to prosecute. Scurvy used to affect anyone who was at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored. They would begin to suffer when they could not get enough vitamin C - vital for the body as it needs it to make collagen, a type of protein found in many different types of tissue, such as skin, blood vessels, bones and cartilage. Without vitamin C, collagen can't be replaced and the different types of tissue break down. Signs of the condition included muscle and joint pain, fatigue, red dots on the skin, and bleeding and swelling of the gums, which can lead to teeth falling out. In 1753 A Royal Navy Scottish surgeon, James Lind, realised that citrus fruits - which have large amounts of vitamin C - could combat the condition and published a study on it. Modern treatment involves taking vitamin C supplements and eating food that's high in vitamin C. 'As a result of our review conclusions, we have today informed the court the prosecution offers no evidence against either Glynn or Julie Seabridge.' While criminal proceedings have now concluded, a coroner's probe into Dylan's death is yet to take place. His inquest was opened and adjourned three years ago. At the full hearing a coroner will be unable to apportion blame over the death due to law. However, is it is expected that the fact-finding mission will give an official cause of death as well as looking at the events leading up to the tragedy.Scurvy was at one time common among sailors deprived of fresh fruit and vegetables while at sea. But it is almost unheard of due to modern diets and health care . Symptoms of scurvy are lethargy, spots on the skin, spongy gums and bleeding from the nose. Treatment involves taking vitamin C supplements and eating food that's high in vitamin C. This should quickly reverse the harmful symptoms of scurvy, the NHS says. Foods such as cabbage, grapefruit, sweet potatoes, lemons, broccoli, limes and tomatoes are all good sources of the essential vitamin.","Dylan Seabridge, 8, died suddenly from the alleged illness in 2011 .

"France's culture minister has provoked a cry of disbelief after admitting that she hasn't read a single book over the past two years. To add to her embarrassment, Fleur Pellerin was also unable to say on a TV show which book by France's new Nobel Literature Prize winner Patrick Modiano was her favourite, just minutes after having said she had lunched with the author. Only two weeks ago, she had hailed Modiano as representing the 'influence and vitality of French literature in the eyes of the world.' Sacre bleu! French culture minister Fleur Pellerin (left) has admitted that she hasn't read a single book in the past two years and didn't know any by France's new Nobel Literature Prize winner Patrick Modiano (right) 'I admit without any problem that I have had no time to read over the past two years,' she went on to say, referring to her time in government first as minister for innovation and the digital economy and now as culture minister. 'I read a lot of notes, I read a lot of legislative documents, I read a lot of news, AFP (news agency) stories... But I read very little.' Her admission sent Twitter ablaze, with many shocked by the fact that a culture minister had not read books for two years and did not know any of Modiano's books. 'Long live our brilliant government and especially culture,' said one Twitter user with the handle @MathieuLecerf. Honoured: Patrick Modiano was named the 111th winner of the Nobel prize for literature earlier this month . But others leapt to her defence or ridiculed the controversy. 'The worst thing is that if Fleur Pellerin had said she spent her evenings reading, many would have blamed her for not working enough,' said @intwittoveritas. 'France is finally facing up to its main problem in this period of deep crisis: Fleur Pellerin has not read Modiano,' joked @HenriRouquier. Modiano, 69, was named the 111th winner of the Nobel Prize for literature earlier this month, taking home the £700,000 award. He is perhaps best known for his 1978 novel Missing Person, for which he won the prestigious Prix Goncourt French literature prize. Pellerin, 41, was born in South Korea but adopted by a French family at six months old after being abandoned on the streets of Seoul. She took over the post of culture minister from Aurélie Filippetti in August and is seen as more progressive on issues such as technology.","Fleur Pellerin also couldn't name novel by France's new Nobel Prize winner .

"A Ukrainian lorry driver is being sought by police after a video was shared on line that showed him  driving his HGV from the passenger seat while using his feet. And just to make sure everybody knew how relaxed he was, he's even seen drinking a cup of tea sweetened he said with a bit of honey. The video was posted in Russian with a note: 'Sometimes one gets tired just sitting behind the wheel, in the passenger seat however it doesn't seem like work at all.' In an attempt to 'impress' his friends, the lorry driver steers the vehicle with his feet . To show how 'relaxed' he is, he passes the time drinking some tea . But when the video was uploaded on the internet it quickly went viral before it was removed, although not before he had been reported to police in several countries. The uploader claimed the video was actually shot in Mexico but many other users were convinced it was shot either in America or Canada. Others quickly shared the video as an example of further stupidity on the roads and urged assistance in helping police to try and help identify where the road was and who the man was. After seeing the enormous amount of traffic the video was deleted by the uploader nicknamed 'vitsipo1' who tried to claim it was filmed in Mexico City. Complaints were made to the police after people viewed the video online . The driver has been identified as Vitaliy Zaporozhets by users online . With vehicles overtaking the lorry, the immense danger of the whole incident is apparent . In the comments under the video before it was deleted one person even provides a name for the alleged driver, Vitaliy Zaporozhets, saying he is a Ukrainian. Others found out that the was a YouTube user called Vitaliy Zaporozhets who was a Ukrainian and has a YouTube channel with a single video that shows him acting up with his friends by undressing down to his boxers while driving, with the three young men eventually identifying themselves as being Ukrainian, Romanian and Moldavian.

"Arrested: Zeguang Xu, 19, was said to be at the wheel of his Maserati when he ran a red light in 30mph zone in the upmarket Back Bay neighborhood in Boston . A wealthy Chinese student has been arrested after allegedly driving at more than 100mph in a 30mph zone without a licence. Zeguang Xu, 19, was  at the wheel of his $126,500 Maserati Gran Turismo, which has a top speed of 177mph, when he ran a red light in the upmarket Back Bay neighborhood in Boston, police have said. The undergraduate student at Boston University's College of Arts and Social Science had a woman in the car when he was stopped and allegedly told officers the vehicle belonged to a friend. A police report said he also claimed that he had left his wallet and licence at home before giving a fake name and address. However the female passenger took the car home when she confirmed Xu was the owner. When pushed by officers, he then handed over his wallet and his Boston University ID. According to the Boston Herald, he pleaded not guilty today in Boston Municipal Court to charges of operating without a license, providing a false name to police, speeding, failure to stop, and negligent operation. He was released from custody after posting $1,000 bail. Suffolk District Attorney Daniel Conley said: 'High speeds, poor driving conditions — this could have been a recipe for disaster. We're very fortunate no one was hurt, including the driver himself.' The intersection where Xu was caught speeding is the same place where two pedestrians were killed earlier this summer. A senior analyst at Kantar Retail, and John 'Jack' Lanzillotti, the Emmy Award-winning manager of Red Sox Productions and Game Operations, were killed when Yemen native Mohamed Alfageeh, 30, allegedly ran a red light and flipped his SUV in June. He is due in court on May 18 to face two counts of motor vehicle homicide. Colin Riley, spokesman for the university, told the Herald he could not speak specifically about Xu's status because of privacy laws but said: 'Certainly what is described here is reckless and dangerous. We hold students accountable when they're arrested for violations of student-conduct policies. We'll get the police report and go from there.'

"Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned that heavily indebted households will be ‘particularly sensitive’ to higher interest rates . Mortgage lenders ‘filled their boots’ by approving scores of applications without making thorough checks just before tougher rules came in, the financial watchdog said. One in five loans was passed without verifying borrowers’ salaries prior to the introduction of the Mortgage Market Review, which banned the practice. The figures came out as Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned that heavily indebted households will be ‘particularly sensitive’ to higher interest rates. In a speech at a conference in Wales yesterday he said record low interest rates posed threats to the economy and ‘the biggest risks are associated with the housing market’. According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) between April and June this year, there were 50,000 mortgage sales when banks and building societies did not check buyers earned what they said they did. This was despite the practice being outlawed on April 26, suggesting many applications were rushed through in the weeks beforehand. These mortgages accounted for 20 per cent of all sales, a 4 per cent increase on the previous quarter. Lynda Blackwell, mortgage policy manager at the FCA, said that ‘just ahead of the MMR coming into force we saw an increase in the number of mortgages where income wasn’t verified’. ‘It looks as if there was a bit of filling of the boots going on before everything was switched off’, she added during a speech at the Financial Services Expo, in London, yesterday. Fast-track mortgages – when loans are granted without requiring proof of income – have since been banned under the MMR. Lenders must now verify all borrowers’ income – which is normally done by checking several pay slips or, for the self-employed, looking at their company accounts. Andrew Montlake, a director at mortgage broker Coreco Group, said: ‘It is inevitable lenders would try to push things through before the regulation came into force.’ One in five loans was passed without verifying borrowers’ salaries prior to the introduction of the Mortgage Market Review, which banned the practice . Interest rates have been frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 – slashing the cost of mortgages for millions and making it easier to get on the housing ladder. But Mr Carney said the first rate rise since 2007 ‘is getting closer’. ‘The economic outlook is much improved,’ he said. ‘While there is always uncertainty about the future, you can expect interest rates to begin to increase.’ The Canadian stressed that any increases ‘are likely to be gradual and limited’ and to a level ‘materially lower than in the past’ when they averaged around 5 per cent. He said such a cautious approach was required in part because of high levels of household debt – much of it tied up in property. Household debt soared from 100 per cent of household income in 1998 to 163 per cent in 2008 before the housing market crashed. It has since fallen below 140 per cent. Two members of the nine-strong committee that sets interest rates at the Bank have urged an immediate rise to 0.75 per cent. Analysts expect rates to rise late this year or in the first half of next year – although it is feared rapid rises could derail the recovery if households cut back on spending to meet mortgage repayments.","One in five loans was passed without verifying borrowers’ salaries .

"Britain is set to enjoy the hottest Halloween on record this week after days of flash flooding in some parts of the country which saw a group of schoolchildren risk their lives by larking around on a flooded road. Despite the heavy downpours which have blighted several regions over the last few days, temperatures are set to remain within the high twenties for the remainder of the week. The Met Office said much of England and Wales will enjoy the above-average temperatures, which will see the mercury hit 21C - making Britain hotter than several European cities including Athens, Rome and Crete. Dangerous: A group of schoolchildren were spotted larking around in deep floodwater on a busy main road in Dudley, West Midlands . Risky: The young boys, still dressed in their school uniforms, were seen jumping off the pavement into the huge puddles of floodwater . Stunning: The Met Office said temperatures were set to reach 20C to 21C in the UK. Pictured: Chew Valley near Pensford, Somerset . Relaxing: One man read his book in the unseasonably favourable conditions in St James's Park, while two women also relaxed . It comes after a weekend of downpours in some areas of the country, including in Dudley, West Midlands, where a group of schoolchildren risked their lives by playing in floodwater on a busy road. The pupils, from Castle High School, could be seen dangerously joking around in the filthy floodwater, with one even lying down in a huge puddle in the middle of the road. Wearing their school uniforms, the youngsters could be seen jumping off the pavement and splashing each other in the face as vehicles passed just inches away from them. The worrying scene on Ednam Road - less than 400 yards from the school - took place while teachers nearby tried to keep traffic moving following torrential flash flooding. Dudley councillor Khurshid Ahmed said he was worried the children's behaviour put them at 'unnecessary risk'. He said: 'It's very dangerous. They do need to be more careful, especially as there is a big bend in the road making it more difficult for drivers to see. 'They shouldn't be putting themselves in danger like that and certainly shouldn't be lying down in the water or trying to have showers and messing about with their friends. 'I will be passing on my concerns to the school and also speaking to the highways department to see what can be done to prevent the road from flooding.' Soaking up the sun: A woman enjoys the beautiful autumnal sunshine in St James's Park, central London, this afternoon . Beautiful: The autumnal leaves which cover Selwyn College in Cambridge shone in the afternoon sun today as temperatures hit 21C . Contrast: Despite today's warm weather in England and Wales, including at St James's Park in London (left), Scotland experienced different weather altogether. One lady was forced to shield herself with an umbrella and raincoat as rain lashed the country (right) Peaceful: A narrowboat made its way up the Grand Union Canal in Little Venice, west London, in this morning's autumnal sunshine . One local resident, who did not wish to be named, added: 'Their behaviour was very stupid. There were teachers nearby who did nothing, these kids could quite easily have been killed. 'One of them was actually lying in the road, it looked like he had gone for a swim in his uniform. His parents would not have been happy when he got home, that's for sure.' Castle High School headteacher Michelle King said she was trying to identify the pupils involved. She said: 'If I can reveal the pupils identities I will deal with them appropriately and speak to their parents. I wasn't happy about what those students were doing. 'We had teachers getting saturated, trying to move the traffic along as it was gridlocked round the school, so I would like to thank them for their dedication. 'We did not receive any complaints about children from drivers in the area, and I have heard that some of the people involved were from other schools too. 'Traffic is always a nightmare on the roads around the school and then you add in flash floods and it becomes very difficult.' Kicking back: As temperatures soared, a group enjoyed the sunshine with a boat trip on Swanbourne Lake in Arundel, West Sussex . Serene: The group made the most of the first day of the half-term holidays with a trip out on the water in Arundel, West Sussex . Tranquil: A group enjoyed punting down the River Cam in Cambridge today as temperatures soared to 21C in some parts of the country . Brave: Swimmers made the most of the above-average temperatures in London today by taking a dip in the Serpentine in Hyde Park . Chilly: Several members of the Serpentine Swimming Club joined swans in the Hyde Park lake in central London for their afternoon swim . Despite the flash flooding, temperatures started to soar across the country today – and the unseasonably favourable weather is set to remain until the weekend. As temperatures reached 21C in parts of southern England today, families enjoyed splashing around in punts and rowing boats on the River Cam in Cambridge while others enjoyed the autumnal sunshine by relaxing in London's parks. Forecasters at the Met Office said tomorrow is also expected to be unseasonably warm and sunny, with the mercury hitting 20C in the South. After a brief respite of cooler weather and downpours on Wednesday, temperatures are expected to again soar on Thursday. It means Halloween on Friday could become the hottest one on record, with the current record for October 31 standing at 19.4C in Margate, Kent, in 1968. Laura Young, a Met Office spokesman, said: 'It is unusually mild for this time of year and it has been a really good start to half term week in the South. 'Parts of the South East could see 20C or 21C today, so it is very mild and there is lots of sun around.' Plucky: One man tried to avoid the swans in the Serpentine in Hyde Park as he went for an afternoon swim despite it being October . Taking a dip: The swimmers enjoyed the serene conditions in Hyde Park as they dusted off the cobwebs in the favourable warm weather . Refreshed: The swimmers ventured into the water as temperatures reached 20C in some parts of the country today . On edge: A swan flaps its wings at London's Hyde Park today as the Met Office predicts the warm weather to last until the weekend . Picture perfect: A family watch the gorgeous sunset on a beach in Heacham, West Norfolk, after a day of above-average weather . Picturesque: The Met Office said the warm weather was set to continue this week. Pictured: This morning's sunrise behind Tower Bridge . However, despite the balmy weather forecast for England and Wales, it is a different story in the North West and Scotland, which will see two days of cloud, wind and rain. The Met Office has issued an amber warning for rain in the Highlands until midday tomorrow and a yellow warning for Strathclyde, Central, Tayside and Fife. The village of Kinlochewe in the Northwest Highlands has seen 172.8mm of rain in the last 60 hours. The rain is set to move south on Wednesday, with showers in the South East, while the Midlands and North will enjoy a clearer day with a mix of sunshine and cloud.","Schoolchildren spotted playing in floodwater on busy road in Dudley, West Midlands, after torrential downpours .

The Silver Shirts were a sinister group of 1930s fascists who took their name from Hitler's Brown Shirts grass roots organisation. Fascism had been on the rise in the wake of the Great Depression and the Silver Shirts were one of the most fanatical organisations. According to reports Norman Stephens was an engineer and apparently financed the operation while his wife, the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, believed Schmidt when he claimed to have supernatural powers. Video courtesy of Mike & Jay Explore . The plans suggest that the wealthy owners of Murphy Ranch dreamed of a complex, self-sustaining 'utopia' with a mansion fit for a world leader, but they were never seen through . The compound was already equipped with a diesel power plant, 375,000 gallon concrete water tank, giant meat locker, 22 bedrooms and even a bomb shelter . The heavily guarded estate was home to a community of Hollywood fascists who hoped to ride out the war there . Unconfirmed reports suggest that Schmidt was Hitler's agent in America. Schmidt warned the couple that Germany would soon defeat the United States and that the end of the world was at hand. He persuaded them to invest $4million ($66 million today) to transform the property into a Nazi stronghold fit for Hitler. They bought the 55-acre ranch, under the name pseudonym 'Jessie M. Murphy, widow' in 1933. Consequently the compound was equipped with a diesel power plant, 375,000 gallon concrete water tank, giant meat locker, 22 bedrooms and even a bomb shelter. The heavily guarded became a home to a community of Hollywood fascists who hoped to ride out the war there and there were further plans to build five libraries, a swimming pool, several dining rooms and a gymnasium with money from Germany. Now LA Curbed has revealed the seemingly forgotten plans for the famous landmark which include those for and by the firm of the legendary Paul R. Williams, who designed the homes of numerous celebrities, including Frank Sinatra. The couple had grand plans drawn up by several different architects, but they were not followed through. In an episode of Travel Channel's 'Off Limits,' historian Randy Young reveals that the wrought iron gates at the entrance of the compound were made by famous African-American architect Paul Revere Williams. The ruins of the compound from where American Nazis hoped their leader would one day rule the world lies tucked away in the Los Angeles hills .

The couple had grand plans drawn up by several different architects, but they were not followed through . 'They may have been Nazis, but they were Nazis with taste,' he joked. Williams' architectural sketches also included plans for a four-story mansion, 22 bedrooms and five bathrooms, but they were never carried out. In 1941, the day after Pearl Harbour, as America entered World War Two, police raided the premises and rounded up the 50 or so American fascists who were living there. Some reports suggest Herr Schmidt was arrested, although there is no proof of this. Norman and Winona sold the compound in 1948 by which point they lived alone in a garage. Abandoned in 1990s, today the eerie landmark lies in ruins, daubed with graffiti. Close to the homes of actors and directors such as Stephen Spielberg, the site has been a magnet for historians, curiosity-seekers and modern-day nazis .

Fruity combination: Ms DeRemer does not limit herself to animals when coming up with the new species. Here she has combined a kangaroo and a mango - the Mangaroo . Painstaking work: Ms DeRemer works with 20 layers on her pictures to make the combinations between the animals, here a killer whale and a black Labrador, seemless . Now she has come up with a set of completely new creatures by merging the cutest members of the animal world with the most ferocious. Each image can take up to four hours to complete and Ms DeRemer, who now lives in Seoul, South Korea, works with 20 layers on the picture to make the combinations seamless. Among her creations are the Laughing Hamstyna - a hamster and hyena blend, a Fierce Schnowlzer - aka a dog and a vulture, and has even combined a kangaroo and a mango. Creature discomfort: This cross between a cat and a Pomeranian does not look like the friendliest of creatures . Fierce creatures: Ms DeRemer says she enjoys the juxtaposition of cure and scary animals, such as this dog and vulture, which come together to create a Fierce Schnowlzer . Favourite: Ms DeRemer says the combination of a baboon and a sparrow, which she has named the Birboon, is one of her favourite creations . A new class of sheepdog: The artist has named the combination of sheep and dog German Shepherds . Something to squawk about: What do you get if you cross a panda and an owl? A Pandowl of course . Art work: Tapirs are known for their protruding snouts, but would one be much use on the body of a shark? Combination: This Angry Beavussy was created from a cat and a beaver by Ms DeRemer, who is originally from California but who now lives in South Korea . The King Charles Spanbull: Here Ms DeRemer has blended together a spaniel and a bull . Juxtaposition: This animal was created using photographs of a hairless sphinx cat and the face of a pig . 'I really enjoy the juxtaposition between cute and scary animals, such as a growling wolf on a pygmy marmoset, or a snarling tiger on a baby monkey,' she said. 'It’s hard to pick a favorite, but I really enjoy both the “Birboon” and “Little Bit” because they’re such adorable little birds with such character from the yawning animals. 'I also really love the White Tiger Monkey because the two animals included are so drastically different but go together so well.' The idea has legs: Each image can take up to four hours to complete, such as this one which combines a sperm whale and a giraffe to make an African Blue Whirrafano . Would its bark be worse than its bite? A cross between a  a snake and terrier - The Green Bark Python . All creatures great and small: This cross between a  a wolf and a finger monkey has been named the Ferocious Pygmy Marmowolf by Ms DeRemer . Raising a smile: Meet the Highland Red Pandow, a cross between a red panda and a yak . Devil dog: Here Ms DeRemer has merged a Tasmanian devil and a puppy to make the Tasmanian Labrador . Enough to make you scream: A cross between a rat and a macaque - also known as a Rankey . Baring its teeth: A wombat and a bat combine to form this rather angry looking creature . New species: A Doffalo is created by Ms DeRemer by splicing a labrador and a buffalo . King of the forest: Here a bear and a deer are merged to create a creature that would give any hiker who came across it a bit of a fright . Yawn! A tired-looking seal and a blue tit combine to create a Sleepy Pirdy . Perfect blend? Ms DeRemer says she loves the White Tiger Monkey because 'the two animals included are so drastically different but go together so well' Singing for his supper: A chipmunk crossed with a sparrow gives way to this animal . Open wide: A lion and a llama join forces to become this yawning Peruvian Llioma .","Artist Sarah DeRemer, 25, has come up with a number of new animals .

"Safety measures at the devastated Fukushima nuclear power plant were tightened today as the strongest storm to hit Japan this year battered the southern islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. Typhoon Vongfong brought heavy rain to Tokyo and caused extensive travel disruption across Japan, where 820,000 people have been urged to leave their homes and seek shelter. Many trains in western cities were suspended, while more than 500 domestic flights were cancelled, the public broadcaster NHK said. At least one overseas flight was cancelled, according to an airline. Scroll down for videos .

About 4,900 households in Tokyo suburbs were without power, media said, and rain in the city was expected to intensify overnight. Vongfong continued to batter the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, 1,000 miles south of Tokyo, where it landed yesterday, and moved up to also hit Kyushu and Shikoku islands, injuring 59 people, NHK said. On Sunday, the wind weakened significantly from the previous day when it reached a peak of 146mph, which had made Vongfong into a 'super typhoon'. Tokyo Electric Power Co, the operator of the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant, said in a statement it had increased the water transfer and storage capacity to prevent an overflow of radioactive water from the plant. A major baseball game in Osaka city, between the Orix Buffaloes and the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters for the Pacific League playoff, was also postponed. More than 200,000 residents were forced to flee their homes on the island, some 1,000 miles south of Tokyo, before it was hit by what was Japan's most powerful storm this year. It was the first time a Nippon Professional Baseball playoff game was cancelled because of a typhoon.

Wind speeds dropped significantly from Saturday's peak of 146mph as the storm made its way towards Tokyo. It is on course to reach Kyushu, the country's third largest island by Monday. Authorities on the island were forced to halt the high-speed bullet train this weekend after strong winds blew a plastic sheet onto the aerial wires on the line. Meanwhile, Japanese airlines JAL and ANA cancelled more than 400 flights due to strong winds. Early on Sunday, parts of Okinawa received more than six centimetres of rain within an hour while some western areas  were forecast to receive total rainfall of over 50 centimetres.

"SAT scores among the nation's high school seniors remain stubbornly stagnant. The College Board, the nonprofit organization that administers the test, reported scores Tuesday from the Class of 2014 that were similar to other recent senior classes. Overall, the mean score in reading was 497. It was 513 in math and 487 in writing. The top score in each category is 800, and 583 of the 1.7 million students from the class who took the test achieved the perfect score of 2,400. About 43 percent of test takers met a benchmark that indicated they were likely ready for credit-bearing, college-level work — a figure that has also remained about the same. Not prepared enough? About 43 percent of SAT takers met a benchmark indicating they were likely ready for credit-bearing, college-level work — a figure that has also remained about the same . Ready or not: The College Board indicated in orange which percentage of SAT students met the college-ready benchmark . The benchmark was met by nearly 53 percent of white and nearly 61 percent of Asian test-takers. Nearly 16 percent of African-American test-takers met the college-ready benchmark, as did nearly a quarter of Hispanic test-takers and about a third of Native Americans. The SAT is undergoing major revisions, but the new exam won't come out until 2016. The College Board said it has seen an increase in students taking not just the SAT but the Advanced Placement and PSAT/NMSQT exams. Passing an Advanced Placement, or AP, exam can earn test-takers college credit. The PSAT/NMSQT test can be used to help place students in AP classes. The College Board said the percentage of public high school juniors and seniors succeeding on at least one AP exam nearly doubled in a decade to 13.2 percent in May 2014. But it said the findings show 'missed opportunities.' While Hispanic students are now taking AP classes at almost the same rate as the nation overall, only about 13 percent of African-American and 12 percent of Native American public high school juniors and seniors took an AP exam in May 2014. Nearly 40 percent of students who were identified by their PSAT/NMSQT scores as having potential for succeeding in an AP course did not take one they were matched to, the College Board said.

"From haunting images of clouds rolling in over a bridge in America to a surfer battling for a wave with a leaping dolphin, photographers from around the world have submitted some of the most stunning panoramic images ever captured. Nearly 900 photographers entered the Epson International Pano Awards, an annual competition that brings together the best wide-lens images of the past 12 months. American Dennis Ramos was the overall winner with his picture of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in St. Petersburg, Florida. 'It was a beautiful cloudless day with some patches of rolling fog over the bridge. My friend and I decided to go fishing that mid afternoon. I found out that my reel wasn't working so I grabbed my camera gear instead,' he said. 'It took me a lot of time waiting and shooting in between the fog to get a good exposure. While waiting during long exposure times, I wished I had my fishing rod as well.' Ben Neale, an Australian photographer, won the amateur competition in the nature and also the open nature category. He used a paraglider to capture a breathtaking image of a flock of brolga birds in Arnhem Land. The picture also won him the highest scoring aerial image. 'It was a tricky shot as I was out shooting landscapes that day and knew I would have to get very low to capture the brolgas in great detail, with a lot of sharp turns and some near misses it all came together in just 3 frames out of 200,' Mr Neale said. Another Aussie photographer who made it in the finalist category was Matt Hutton. He named his shot 'Right Place Right Time' after capturing a magical moment between a dolphin and a surfer at Jacques Point in Western Australia. The fifth Epson International Pano Awards received nearly 4000 entries from 870 photographers, each vying for the $40,000 top prize. Dennis Ramos, the overall open photographer of the year .

"Panic over Ebola has flared across the U.S. including incidents where two students being barred from enrolling in school this week because they had recently returned from West Africa. The children's father worked for humanitarian organization CARE in Liberia before returning last month to Dunwoody, Georgia and trying to enroll the siblings in local elementary and high schools. However he was barred from doing so because the children had not been cleared by the CDC. It also emerged today that two Pulitzer prize-winning photojournalists were uninvited to a  workshop at Syracuse University this weekend because they returned from West Africa three weeks ago after covering the Ebola epidemic - despite the couple being past the 21-day incubation period for the virus. Scroll down for video . Pulitzer prize-winning photojournalists, Michel du Cille and his wife, Nikki Kahn, were uninvited to a workshop at Syracuse University because they were recently in West Africa covering Ebola . A photograph taken by Mr du Cille at Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia on September 20. The Pulitzer prize winner and his wife were uninvited to a college event this weekend at Syracuse University over Ebola fears - despite the couple being beyond the 21-day incubation period for the virus . Michel du Cille and his wife, Nikki Kahn, were scheduled to take part in sessions to review students' portfolios at the Newhouse School of Public Communications. The decision to prevent the photojournalists from attending was allegedly made after a student at the school researched Mr Du Cille and raised concern having seen he was recently in Liberia. Mr du Cille told The Washington Post: 'It’s a disappointment to me. I’m p***** off and embarrassed and completely weirded out that a journalism institution that should be seeking out facts and details is basically pandering to hysteria.' MailOnline had reached out to the school and was awaiting comment. As for the family who recently returned to Georgia from West Africa, school officials told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution they had a letter from CARE to say they had passed more than 21 days - the period when Ebola can develop - but that the school district needed proof from a local health authority or CDC. MailOnline was awaiting comment from the Dekalb school district on Friday however a spokesman said earlier that the family 'understands' the decision. An emergency worker in hazmat suit sprays another worker in a Pentagon parking lot after a woman who recently traveled to Africa vomited there today . It is not clear that an Ebola incident was suspected on Thursday in Manhattan - but emergency responders arrived in full hazmat suits. A Broward County Fire Rescue hazmat team works at the Broward County main jail today after an inmate claimed he has Ebola - as a precaution, Broward's Main Jail has been placed on lockdown . While the two incidents appeared to be over-reactions to Ebola, they joined a growing number of potential virus reports across the U.S. The Pentagon police today shut down a building entrance and a portion of the south parking lot because a woman was sick and told emergency personnel that she had recently been to West Africa, officials said. Arlington County, Virginia responded with a HazMat team and was treating it as a possible Ebola case. She was taken to a local hospital, county officials said. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Crosson said that out of an abundance of caution, all pedestrian and vehicle traffic was stopped across 17 lanes of the huge parking lot. A building entrance and parking lanes are temporarily closed, he said. In New York City on Thursday, emergency responders wheeled a patient into an ambulance on the Upper East Side wearing full hazmat suits and facemasks,WPIX reported. It is not clear if Ebola was suspected or if the city had recommended the measures out of an abundance of caution. Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut evaluated a patient with 'Ebola-like symptoms' on Wednesday. However the following day, preliminary tests showed that the Yale University graduate student did not have the disease. The patient is one of two Yale epidemiology students who traveled to Liberia last month to advise the health ministry on using computers to track Ebola. A female prisoner in Virginia, who traveled to West Africa in recent weeks, was taken to Inova Loudon Hospital on Thursday after developing a fever. She was being tested but officials say there's a 'very low probability' she has the deadly virus. In California, Southwestern College was cordoned off for a few hours on Thursday following the news that a student had been on the same flight as Ebola-stricken nurse Amber Jay Vinson - and her younger sister has since vomited. There are currently four Americans being treated for Ebola in the United States. NBC News freelancer Ashoka Mukpo, 33,  is being treated at University of Nebraska Medical Center in Lincoln. Nurse Amber Vinson, 29,  is at Emory University Hospital, along with an American World Health Organization doctor, who has not been identified, who contracted the disease while working in Sierre Leone. Nurse Nina Pham , 26, is being treated at the National Institutes for Health in Maryland. According to World Health Organization guidelines, Ebola is not an air-borne virus. It is only spread through direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.

"The horrors of trench life have been well documented, but now it seems British soldiers on the Western Front had more than just shells and bullets to contend with. A grisly list of the most common injuries and ailments endured by men serving in the First World War reveals sexually transmitted diseases, haemorrhoids and wasp stings were among the most debilitating. While gunshot wounds, trench foot and mustard gas poisoning feature heavily in the previously unseen archive, the men also often went sick with diseases such as gonorrhoea and syphilis according to researchers, who have painstakingly transcribed 30,000 medical records. Scroll down for video . The painfully transcribed records show while gunshot wounds, trench foot and mustard gas poisoning feature heavily in the previously unseen archive, the men also often went sick with diseases such as gonorrhoea and syphilis . Millions of soldiers had to contend with sexually transmitted diseases, hemorrhoids and arthritis on top of being shot at and shelled in the trenches of the First World War, records released today show . Experts say STDs were rife in the First World War as soldiers often visited French brothels looking for 'warmth and comfort' to escape the horrors of the trenches. Piles were a persistent problem for the men brought about by the cold ground they had to sit on coupled with the lack of care over their personal hygiene. Rheumatism was another hindrance as soldiers were unable to stand up tall in the trenches in case they were picked off by a German sniper. The increased pressure on their knees and ankle joints from having to constantly crouch down led to complaints of arthritis despite their relatively young age. And a rather surprising ailment that often had to be treated by medics was wasp stings. Researchers from the military genealogy website Forces War Records are in the process of transcribing and digitising 1.5 million unseen medical records from the First World War that are held at the National Archives at Kew, west London. King George V visits wounded soldiers at Number 3 Base Hospital, Sheffield. Expected occupational hazards such as gunshot wound, trench foot and mustard gas poisoning feature heavily in the previously unseen archive . They have completed the first tranche of 30,000 records that will be available online for people to search their ancestors from tomorrow. It is expected that it will take another two years to transcribe and upload the whole archive. This is the first time such records have been accessible to the wider public. Experts say it is invaluable as, while information on soldiers who were killed was recorded, hardly any exists for those who were injured and survived. Most medical records were destroyed after the First World War or during the Blitz of London in World War Two. The records being made available now came from the Royal Army Medical Corps, in particular the 51st Field Ambulance, a frontline medical unit. Two injured soldiers play draughts whilst recuperating in hospital. Researchers from the military genealogy website Forces War Records are in the process of transcribing and digitising 1.5 million unseen records . Dominic Hayhoe, chief executive of Forces War Records, said: 'For those killed in battle, names can generally be found in rolls of honour, war diaries or names on a cenotaph. 'However, for personnel who were injured and survived, military information tends to be very scarce. An entry in a medical register might be the only record of their WW1 service. 'They can show who was treated, for what and their movements after being patched up or taken to hospital. 'Wet, cold, squalid conditions of trench warfare brought with it untold discomfort and suffering. 'From conditions such as gunshot wounds, trench foot and mustard gas poisoning to tonsillitis, Spanish flu and even in-growing toenails, few men escaped unscathed. 'These records are priceless pieces of information for families looking up their ancestor's past. Unless they had been killed, many went through the war largely undocumented. 'A soldier who was killed or badly injured in action would often make the news back home but one suffering from haemorrhoids would not, understandably.' To coincide with the release of information, Forces War Records has also published an e-book called Trench Traumas and Medical Miracles that explains in layman's terms some of the medical procedures carried out. The e-book also contains a top 20 list of the most common complaints among the men. The unique research has shown that seemingly benign wounds, like a cut to the finger, often led to much more serious illness and infection due to the level of bacteria in the trenches . Ceri Gage, curator of collections at the Army Medical Services Museum in Aldershot, Hants, has helped the researchers with their work. She said: 'This is an invaluable source of research that gives people the opportunity to trace an ancestor, the type of injury or ailment they suffered and what happened to them afterwards. 'The top 20 list is the most accurate breakdown of ailments soldiers suffered in the trenches. 'Infections presented the biggest problem. A simple cut to a finger from cleaning your gun or digging a trench could quite quickly become infected and develop into pneumonia. 'The men were knee deep in mud nine out of 12 months of the year surrounded by bacteria from the bodies of men and animals in No Man's Land. 'Their bodies were weaker anyway from a lack of sleep, wet and dirty clothes and a restricted diet in which a piece of fruit or vegetable was a treat.' The unique research has shown that seemingly benign wounds, like a cut to the finger, often led to much more serious illness and infection due to the level of bacteria in the trenches. It also highlights that, apart from being shot or hit by a shell fragment, one of the most deadly injuries a soldier could suffer was a broken leg, even from an innocuous fall. Injured Tommies were jolted and banged about so much during their journey on a stretcher from the front to a field ambulance and a casualty station that the fractured femur bone would often rupture an artery. During the early part of the war, a soldier with a broken leg had an 80 per cent chance of dying but after the Thomas traction splint came into use in 1916 that rate went down to just seven per cent.","Gonorrhoea and syphilis among most debilitating ailments for soldiers .

"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has not been seen in public for more than a month, prompting speculation that he has been placed under house arrest. The 31-year-old leader has not been seen since an appearance at a public concert on September 3rd in the nation's capital, Pyongyang. Kim's absence has sparked extensive speculation about his whereabouts, with some reports even claiming he was suffering from bad health because of an 'addiction to cheese'. Kim Jung-un (pictured) has not been seen in public for more than a month. He was last seen at a concert in Pyongyang on September the 3rd. In July, the 31-year-old leader had an obvious limp at the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather. Speculation about where the leader has gone is rife . North Korean state media reported last month that he was 'suffering from discomfort', but nothing else was specified. In July, the leader had an obvious limp at the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, North Korean founder, Kim Il-sung. Remco Breuker, professor of Korean studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told the ABC the dictator could have been placed under house arrest. 'We're not sure where he is, or what's happening. We don't know whether he's in the hospital or whether he's been put under house arrest,' Breuker said. Professor Felix Patrikeeff, a North Korea analyst from the University of Adelaide, told Daily Mail Australia this was not the first time a North Korean dictator had vanished from public view. 'The same thing happened  happened to Kim Il in the 1990s. He was absent from the public for some time. That era is generally looked at as a consolidation of power.' But Patrikeeff says it's too early to jump to any conclusions about the leaders absence. 'It could mean any number of things. It is possible that the country could be going through a period of readjustment, but it's just too early to say.' 'There are further indications of changes in the leadership. For example, they have taken a milder line on South Korean relations. 'Some DPKR officials visited South Korea for Asian Games on Sunday,' he said. 'They have also recently admitted to the existence of labour camps, further suggesting they are taking a softer stance. ' A North Korea analyst from the University of Adelaide has said this was not the first time a North Korean dictator has vanished from public view . A North Korean national assembly meeting in April. There are speculations about changes in leadership since Kim Jong-un has vanished from the public eye for over a month . Professor Felix Patrikeeff, a North Korea analyst from the University of Adelaide, says it's too early to jump to any conclusions about the public disappearance of the leader . Patrikeeff believes there is a distinct change in North Korean propaganda of late. 'In terms of the media, there is a real lightening of the mood. The leadership in North Korea seems to be taking a more reasonable stance.' In regards to the speculation he could be under arrest, Patrikeeff says 'we will have to wait and see. Any Western reports on North Korea need to be take with a grain of salt.' 'We need clear evidence before we can make any conclusions. Generally, with this type of regime, this would mean another figure becoming prominent in the public eye and making significant announcements,' he said. 'If that happened, we could have reason to believe there could be an imminent change in leadership.'","North Korea leader Kim Jong-un was last seen at a public concert in Pyongyang on September 3rd .

"Shot dead: Maxwell Gadau lost his life on September 28 in Chicago after walking to a drug deal with a 17-year-old girl, who was also shot . A fifth teenager has been arrested by police investigating the fatal shooting of a Chicago high school student Maxwell Gadau. The arrest of the suspected gunman, 17, comes just one day after four other teens, including two of the teen's friends were charged in connection with the death of Gadau and a 17-year-old girl last month. The fifth teenager, who so far has not been named, was taken into custody during a class at Harlan High School after apparently being named by the four other suspects. According to Skokie Police Commander David Pawlak, two of the four named suspects, Dzevad Avdic and Jeremy Ly were friends with Gadau and are being held without bond along with Myles Hughes and Nicholas Smith. They are all 19. The arrests came just hours after a memorial service for Gadau and his mother, Patricia Gadau said the news had brought her 'great relief'. 'That to me is a blessing. On the day of his service, I know no other child will be harmed by these boys,' said Patricia Gadau to the Chicago Tribune. 'The community will feel safe again.' Speaking to the newspaper, Gadau said that she was devastated at the 'betrayl' from her son's friends. 'It’s sad because I know their parents raised them here in Skokie to protect them from what we’ve been exposed to,' said Gadau to the Chicago Tribune. Charged: From left to right: Myles Hughes, Nicholas Smith, Jeremy Ly and Dzevad Avdic. A fifth teen has been charged but his photograph has not been released, nor has he been named . Relief: Patricia Gadau (left) has said her son's (Maxwell Gadau, left) death has left her devastated, but the arrest of five men over the past two days has come as some consolation . During the first court appearance on Sunday of Avdic, Ly, Hughes and Smith, prosecutors alleged that shooting was a drug deal for marijuana that went wrong. Patricia Gadau told NBC that her son was asked by the girl to go with her to the deal for 'protection'. 'Max went to front of the house, to the car, where they were approached by two men on foot and they shot him,' she said to NBC. 'She wanted him to protect her and he did, and he lost his life for it.' Grief: The community of Skokie has been left devastated by the death of the popular high school student . Respect: Family and friends gathered Sunday at a memorial service in Evanston. in the north of Chicago . Prosecutors have alleged that Avdic was behind the robbery and Ly was the one who suggested they try to mug the 17-year-old girl. They further allege that Avdic was responsible for the deal using text messages and drove Hughes, Smith and the 17-year-old arrested on Monday to the pre-arranged point where the shooting took place. Gadau was shot in the back and the teen girl was shot in the face. The girl remains hospitalized and is on a respirator, officials said. According to prosecutors, the teens smoked drugs as they sped away from the scene. Gadau said one of the teens was even on the same swim team as her son. An attorney for Nicholas Smith, Edgar Howard, said his client is innocent. 'He was just a passenger in the car,' said Howard to NBC.","Maxwell Gadau, 17, was shot dead in September in Chicago .

"Coasting schools in middle-class areas will be targeted by government hit squads if they fail to improve, David Cameron warned last night. The Prime Minister said former head teachers could be sent in to turn round schools in affluent areas which inspectors believe should be doing far better. He made his pledge ahead of an announcement today of a rescue package for 500 of England’s worst schools. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, on a visit to Ark Charter Academy in Portsmouth today, vowed to target schools in middle-class areas for whom there is no excuse for poor performance, as well as institutions tackling poverty . Local experts, including ex-heads, will be sent in to get rid of poor teachers, beef up curriculums and implement tough disciplinary regimes. Mr Cameron will also announce a central pool of the best teachers, who would be sent into failing schools. He wants 1,500 such ‘crack teachers’ in a National Teacher Service by 2020. In an article for the Daily Mail the Prime Minister warns that the powers would not only be used for failing schools contending with poverty, violence and lack of aspiration in the poorest communities, but also in middle-class areas where schools have no excuses for poor performance. He said: ‘We will look at what they can do for … what I call coasting schools … Every day a school fails is a day too long. So these measures will happen fast.’ The intervention follows a damning Ofsted report warning of a culture of low-level disruption and disrespect in schools. The education watchdog said last month that misbehaviour was part of ‘everyday life’ in the classroom, with teachers estimating they lose up to an hour a day to indiscipline – equivalent to 38 days’ teaching a year. Mr Cameron said he wanted all parents to have access to schools as good as the state primary his daughter Florence attends. ‘We all know the difference good teaching makes,’ he said. ‘The moment when an interest was sparked, a subject was mastered, or a career was inspired – these turning points can so often be traced back to one special teacher. 'So I want every child in Britain to have access to great teaching. ‘It will remain my mission to give every parent that sense of security – the knowledge that their child’s education really is helping them to reach their potential and succeed in life.’ Mr Cameron will unveil the rescue package alongside Education Secretary Nicky Morgan today. The plans –not signed off by the Liberal Democrats – will be part of the Tory manifesto. There are already eight ‘regional schools commissioners’ including ex-heads, who oversee free schools and academies. Regional schools commissioners can be sent into coasting schools, and will be given sweeping powers to implement new discipline codes, being in behaviour specialists, and dispose of failing staff . Mr Cameron and Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (centred) later posed for a group photograph with almost 200 head teachers from 300 free schools from across the country, at a reception held in London . Teachers should take an oath to commit themselves to the values of their profession, says Labour’s Tristram Hunt. The party’s education spokesman said it would be like the Hippocratic oath taken by doctors and would ‘elevate’ teachers’ status. But last night a Conservative spokesman dismissed the idea as a ‘patronising gimmick’. Mr Hunt believes the practice would emphasise teachers’ responsibility ‘to provide a sense of moral purpose and virtue’ to pupils. He was inspired by an oath taken by teachers in Singapore. Mr Cameron wants to expand their reach to immediate intervention in any state school deemed ‘inadequate’ by Ofsted. The RSCs will be able to instruct schools to implement new policies on standards, discipline and leadership. Their new powers, which will cover 500 schools with 100,000 pupils, will be developed after consultation with teachers. They may include allowing RSCs to recommend a tariff of punishments for bad behaviour. Other ideas include bringing in behaviour specialists. The experts could make immediate personnel changes to the governing body to improve the calibre of leadership and ensure it has the necessary skills to improve. Mr Cameron will also announce that a Tory government will set up a National Teaching Service, a central pool of high-quality teachers who can be seconded to poor- performing schools. Mrs Morgan said: ‘Labour failed an entire generation, breaking our education system … Our plan for education is clearing up Labour’s mess … targeting the schools where failure has become ingrained. 'We will not tolerate failure, and where we find it we will use tried and trusted interventions to turn things around in the interests of young people everywhere.’ Mr Cameron added: ‘We want to build a Britain with an education system that helps our children reach their potential … That’s why we’re going to rescue 500 schools and help 100,000 children get new opportunities.’ Tristram Hunt, Labour’s education spokesman, said it was ‘this government’s damaging schools policy that has failed pupils’, adding that ministers were ‘trying to play catch-up’. 'I want your children to have what Florence has, a top rate education in a brilliant state school' Taking my four-year-old daughter Florence to school for the first time is something I won’t forget. All parents know that feeling – the apprehension as you let go of your child’s hand and watch them run across the playground towards their new friends. But what gave me peace of mind, what made it a little easier to walk away, was knowing that Florence is being taught at a brilliant state primary school. I want for your children what I have for my own, because no child in Britain should be born to have a second-rate education. We have made good progress, with rigour in the curriculum, discipline in the classroom, and well-respected qualifications on exam certificates. Because these aren’t just letters on a piece of paper – they’re our children’s ticket to a better, brighter future. Labour failed to do these things. Subjects like maths and English were dumbed down. The number of teenagers studying academic GCSEs, like science, halved. Businesses wouldn’t employ school leavers because they lacked basic skills. And as countries like Singapore and Poland were raising the bar in education, Labour just moved the goalposts, making it twice as easy to get an A* or A – with nearly a quarter of all pupils achieving the top grades. We are creating more good schools, freeing teachers from the constraints imposed by local councils and establishing 4,200 Academies. We have helped 250 groups of parents, teachers, charities and businesses set up their own schools – Free Schools. We have toughened up the National Curriculum to make it truly rigorous. And our plan is working: 800,000 more children are in good or outstanding schools; nearly 250,000 fewer are in failing schools. There are Free Schools that are sending as many pupils to Oxbridge as independent schools. There are former failing schools which, as Academies, have become beacons of achievement. One is St Luke’s in Portsmouth. Fourteen years ago, not a single pupil achieved five A* to C grades at GCSE, including maths and English. Today, as an Academy, it boasts 68 per cent A* to C grades. We know the ingredients of a great state school: great teachers, great leadership and an intolerance of failure – and freedom for those great teachers. Now we want to go further. First, we will get more brilliant teachers into the schools that need them most. With programmes like Teach First, more top graduates are training to be teachers than ever before. But we will go further. A National Teaching Fellowship will pay the best of the best to work in failing or inadequate schools. I want to see 1,500 of these top teachers signed up and in post by 2020. That means two in every school; every child within reach of first-class teaching. We all know the difference good teaching makes. The moment when an interest was sparked, a subject was mastered, or a career was inspired – these turning points can so often be traced back to one special teacher. 'The moment when an interest was sparked, a subject was mastered, or a career was inspired - these turning points can so often be traced back to one special teacher' Second, we will get to grips with failing schools. There are still too many in our country – 500 of them teaching 100,000 of our children. Currently there are eight regional school commissioners overseeing all Free Schools and Academies. We will give these experts, who include former teachers, a wider remit: unprecedented powers to overhaul failing schools. If it’s the leadership that’s not working, they can make them remove it – reappointing the whole governing body if they have to. If the curriculum isn’t up to scratch, they can change it. They can issue new disciplinary measures for bad behaviour. They can pair up failing schools with good local schools. And if they succeed, we will look at what they can do for schools that are said to ‘require improvement’ – what I call coasting schools. When it comes to our children’s education, we don’t have a year to waste. Every day a school fails is a day too long. So these measures will happen fast. After her first month at school, Florence is coming home every day repeating things she has heard her teacher say, excited to learn more. It will remain my mission to give every parent that sense of security – the knowledge that their child’s education really is helping them to reach their potential and succeed in life.","Cameron takes on schools in affluent areas who should be doing better .

"James Moss, (above) 33, appeared in court alongside thug Phil Spence today, and pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods including mobile phones, handbags and jewellery . A man has admitted attacking three wealthy Arab sisters with a claw hammer in their London hotel room, but denies trying to kill them. Philip Spence, 32, from Hounslow, west London, left one of the women with just five per cent brain function in the violent burglary at the four-star Cumberland Hotel near Marble Arch earlier this year. Her two sisters suffered fractured skulls, and one was left with a broken arm in the attack in the early hours of April 6. Spence has pleaded guilty to three counts of grievous bodily harm at London's Southwark Crown Court, and one count of aggravated burglary. But he faces trial for the attempted murder of the women, who were visiting Britain from the UAE on a shopping and sightseeing trip. Ohoud Al-Najar and her sisters, Kohloud and Fatima, were attacked with a claw hammer in their room in the early hours of Sunday April 6. Police said at the time that one of the women suffered life-threatening head and facial injuries, lost her left eye and significant quantities of blood.  They said she has five per cent brain function as a result. Another sister suffered two fractures to her skull, a broken left arm and a fracture to her cheekbone, and the third sister had a fracture to her skull and a ruptured left eardrum. Spence entered his guilty pleas last Wednesday but reporting restrictions were only lifted today.  In the trial, which is expected to begin tomorrow, he will face three charges of attempted murder and one of conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary. A second man, 57-year-old Thomas Efremi, of Islington, north London, will also face one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary. Efremi pleaded guilty to fraud at an earlier hearing after withdrawing thousands of pounds from stolen credit cards. Both men are being held in custody.

"Children are becoming too scared to sing because they fear they will be subjected to X Factor-style ridicule, a Royal Opera House conductor has warned. Dominic Peckham said auditions for the programme were like a '19th century freak show' that resulted in children 'crumbling' when they are asked to perform. Mr Peckham, who directs the Royal Opera House's youth chorus, said schools needed to do more to support children. The X Factor has attracted a number of peculiar contestants, including Michael Jackson wannabe Michael Lewis in 2010 - but Mr Peckham fears it is making children reluctant too sing and perform . The Royal Opera House conductor likened the X Factor to a '19th century freak show' that was making children scared to sing . Mr Peckham, who directs the Royal Opera House's youth chorus, said schools needed to do more to support children . Mr Peckham said the ridicule many contestants are met with on X Factor had led to children crumbling when they are asked to perform on stage . In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, he said: 'In my experience as a youth chorus director, for years I've had children shaking their heads and just crumbling when I ask them to have a go at a song. 'You can see in their eyes that they think they are going to be no good and in many respects it's reality TV shows like The X Factor that are to blame for that.' 'As viewers we are sponsoring a multi-million pound freak show that creates a culture where people are ridiculed for performing and expressing themselves. 'That has now filtered down to young people who do not want to get involved with singing lessons or performing because they fear they will be laughed at. 'No one deserves that, and I have a real issue with the production companies driving us towards those freaky moments of performance. It greatly stands in the way of young people learning to sing, perform and audition.' While Mr Peckham attacked the X Factor, he reserved some praise for the BBC's the Voice. He said the programme put greater emphasis on 'contestants' raw talent' rather than image. Mr Peckham said: 'As viewers we are sponsoring a multi-million pound freak show that creates a culture where people are ridiculed for performing and expressing themselves' He added: 'You can see in their eyes that they think they are going to be no good and in many respects it's reality TV shows like The X Factor that are to blame for that' Former judges Tulisa Contostavlos and Gary Barlow poke fun at one of the contestants on the show . The X-Factor has been widely criticised by musicians and other education experts in the past. The show is currently in its 10th year as the cornerstone of the ITV1 Saturday evening schedule. Musician Sting called the show 'televised karaoke', with the contestants being encouraged to 'conform to stereotypes' and saying that real musical talent was more likely to be found in pubs and clubs. Blur singer Damon Albarn said the show created 'a mindset that suggests you can get something for nothing and that it's easy to acquire status and fame', while his band mate Graham Coxon said it was 'disgraceful'. At the 2009 MOBO Awards, V V Brown said: 'I don't like it - it's making kids think that they can get really famous easily, rather than working really hard to achieve something'. James Morrison stated '[X Factor] sends out the message that you can be famous for doing f*** all and that you can succeed even if you're not a good singer'. DJ Calvin Harris blasted the show as a 'joke' and that Cowell had a 'frightening stranglehold' of the British charts. In a similar criticism, Noel Gallagher attacked the show for having 'absolutely nothing to do with music and everything to do with television'. Simon Cowell has been attacked for his 'frightening stranglehold' of the British charts by some musicians . Elsewhere, psychologist Melanie Gill, who has advised the Government on child welfare, said it is impossible to know which children may be harmed by performing in front of millions of viewers. She said: ‘It is awful that The X Factor is willing to risk the welfare of such vulnerable young people by lowering the age limit again. ‘They say they are looked after, but the reality is that their brains are not fully developed. ‘The children may look fine, but their broad grins are fake and are put on for the adults. You can’t tell what is going on inside and they don’t have the emotional strength to cope with some of the stresses a show like this brings. ‘Very often, the youngest contestants are pressured by pushy parents to compete. ‘Being humiliated in front of a mass audience and having their dreams shattered could put them at risk of depression in later life.’","Dominic Peckham, a Royal Opera House conductor, criticised the X Factor .

"There may never be a British Edward Snowden because GCHQ treats contractors 'as if they are people', the outgoing head of the government's listening post has said. In his first ever print interview today, Sir Iain Lobban revealed he feared Mr Snowden could have been a Brit when his leaks were first reported - before discovering he was American. But he insisted a key fact was that Mr Snowden was an unattached contractor with high-level access but little loyalty to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). Unlikely: Outgoing GCHQ chief Sir Iain Lobban, pictured before a parliamentary committee last year, said a British Edward Snowden was unlikely because the spy agency treats contractors 'as if they are people' Unattached: Edward Snowden (pictured) was a contractor with less loyalty to the government, Sir Iain said . Security experts in Britain, on the other hand, were likely to be more loyal because they were more firmly embedded with the government. The 54-year-old was forced to defend his organisation to MPs in an unprecedented public hearing after the U.S. whistleblower revealed it was gathering millions of pieces of data on British citizens. Almost a year later, he has given an interview just days from stepping down as the head of the spy agency. He told Charles Moore, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph: 'When I heard the news... I lay awake saying to myself: ""I hope this isn't a Brit"".' But, he insisted, GCHQ 'treats our contractors as if they are people. We wouldn't body-shop them' - so they are unlikely to betray their employers in the same way. Based in a doughnut-shaped building with more than 5,000 employees in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) was formed in 1919 and employed Enigma code-breaker Alan Turing in the Second World War. Rare appearance: Sir Iain (right) addressed MPs alongside the heads of MI5 and MI6 last year. He told them: 'We don't want to delve into innocent e-mails and phonecalls. I don't employ the type of people who would do' Doughnut: Sir Iain made the fresh comments in his first print interview at GCHQ's Cheltenham headquarters . The rise of digital communications has pushed it to the forefront of British spying - as well as the headlines which surrounded the Snowden affair. The 31-year-old leaker, who is sheltering in Russia, claimed GCHQ was monitoring up to 600 million communications a day by 'tapping' fibre-optic cables which carried data into Britain. Despite believing there are few employees who think like Mr Snowden, Sir Iain told Mr Moore the leaks had 'made my job a thousand times more difficult'. Another staff member in the Cheltenham headquarters said jobs which once took two weeks now take six because of the leaks. Whitehall chiefs revealed Sir Iain would be leaving his role just two months after he was forced to defend his organisation before the government's Intelligence and Security Committee. In an unprecedented 90-minute hearing alongside the heads of MI5 and MI6 last November, he claimed terrorists were already changing their tactics because of Mr Snowden's revelations. He added: 'We don't want to delve into innocent e-mails and phonecalls. I don't employ the type of people who would do. 'If you think of the internet as an enormous hay field, what we are trying to do is to collect hay from those parts of the field that we can get access to. 'When we gather that haystack, and remember it is not a haystack from the whole field, it is a haystack from a tiny proportion of that field, we are very, very well aware that within that haystack there is going to be plenty of hay which is innocent communications from innocent people. Defence: In a hearing before the Council of Europe in April (pictured) Mr Snowden said: My motivation is to improve government, not to bring it down.' He added: 'I remain in a position of significant legal jeopardy' 'The cumulative effect of the media coverage, the global media coverage, will make the job that we have far, far harder for years to come.' Despite Sir Iain being just 53 when his departure was revealed, the government insisted it was not linked to the Snowden row and had been long in the planning. The NSA whistleblower defended his decision to leak thousands of documents in an appearance in April before Europe's largest human rights watchdog. He told the Council of Europe, a human rights group with 47 member states: 'My motivation is to improve government, not to bring it down.' Despite the changes which had been made because of his revelations, he added: 'I remain in a position of significant legal jeopardy'.","Sir Iain Lobban, 54, is retiring from government's listening post this month .

"More than 6,000 children across England have been reported as at risk of sexual exploitation in the past 18 months, according to new figures. The data, collected by Channel 4, shows that 6,300 children aged under 16 have been flagged up to social services for being vulnerable to exploitation since January last year. The figures, which were obtained from 88 councils across the country, have been disclosed following the Rotherham sex abuse scandal where more than 1,400 children were sexually abused over a 16-year period. The data from 88 councils across England shows that 6,300 children aged under 16 have been flagged up to social services for being vulnerable to exploitation since January last year (file picture, posed by a model) According to the new information, social services were aware of 3,202 children at risk in 2013 and a total of 3,009 children were referred to social services, or known to them already, in the first six months of 2014. The data shows that those as young as newborn babies and toddlers could have been exploited and the council reported potential exploitation of children aged between nine and 14 through gangs, social media, family members and massage parlours. Children were found to be most at risk in northern regions, with 452 deemed at risk in Manchester, 407 in Derbyshire, 363 in Sheffield and 311 in Blackburn and Darwen. However, the problem is not just confined to the north, as the data shows that children are at risk nationwide – including 256 in the London borough of Havering, 230 in Northamptonshire, 196 in Hampshire and 140 in Southampton. Ann Coffey, the Labour MP for Stockport, (pictured) is currently chairing an inquiry into child exploitation . Of those reported at risk, the majority were girls but 523 cases involved young boys. Ann Coffey, the Labour MP for Stockport who is chairing an inquiry into child exploitation, said agencies were being more pro-active in tackling exploitation nowadays. She told Channel 4 News: 'I think that child sexual exploitation has been under-identified for a very long time - part of the reason being that victims feel they are going to be blamed for what happened to them. 'Agencies are being much more proactive in going out and identifying children at risk of sexual exploitation and hopefully intervening before that sexual exploitation and the trauma that it causes children occurs.' She also said that with proper information being widely available, the public may become better at recognising the signs and symptoms of sexual exploitation in their own neighbourhood, making it easier for them to report children who are at risk. The issue of 'victim blaming' by the agencies and authorities who were tasked to support the children had been 'a real problem for victims' in the past, but Ms Coffey said this situation was now changing. She said: 'I don't think the police can deal with this by themselves - that is why we need to engage the community.' According to the NSPCC, child sexual exploitation involves the manipulation or coercion of young people under the age of 18 into sexual activity in exchange for money, gifts, accommodation, affection or status.","Data reveals that 6,300 children aged under 16 have been reported as at risk .

"Pizza with Marmite-stuffed crust, bacon and black pudding sandwich, and bangers and mash for breakfast ... this is the perception of British food around the world. To judge how British cuisine is seen around the world, UK travel and deals provider Travelzoo's teams in the company’s global offices reviewed the menus of so-called ‘British restaurants’ in their region. There are some very interesting dishes on offer around the world masquerading as British food, from  'shepherd's pie egg roll' in Chicago to 'scotch egg salad' in China. British cuisine at home and abroad: According to a new report by Travelzoo, there is nothing Britons love more than a Sunday Roast - but the perception of British cuisine abroad is very strange indeed . British-themed restaurants in Sydney and Benidorm put an emphasis on black pudding, but bizarrely place it in a bacon sandwich, and team it with mango chutney, respectively. An eatery in Hong Kong serves up scotch eggs with avocado salad, but perhaps the most unusual take on British fare comes from Chicago, where one restaurant offers shepherd's pie in egg roll form. The unusual offerings may please customers abroad looking for a taste - any taste - of home, but on UK soil, culinary preferences are somewhat more traditional. 1. New Zealand: Pizza with a cheesy Marmite-stuffed crust . 2. New York, USA: Traditional bangers and mash complete with gravy, for breakfast! 3. Benidorm, Spain: Black pudding with bacon, mushrooms and mango chutney . 4. Hong Kong, China: Scotch egg and avocado salad . 5. Sydney, Australia: Bacon and black pudding sandwich . The nation's favourite cuisine when dining out is traditional British, according to Travelzoo's report, which celebrates British Food Fortnight. The Friday night curry comes a close second as Britons' preferred dining choice, followed by Italian and Chinese. The survey also uncovered regional differences. Surveyed members in Brighton voted Italian their number-one choice, while Scots, Londoners and Mancunians chose Indian over British cuisine. Taste of Britain? Most people love a pizza, but according to a restaurant in New Zealand, the British version comes with a Marmite-stuffed crust . Heather Rogers, General Manager of Travelzoo’s UK restaurant deal business said, 'British consumers like to think of themselves as adventurous in their dining habits, but we have found there is still a real affection for traditional British food. 'When you consider the incredible success of programmes such as The Great British Bake Off, as well as the general evolution of the British restaurant scene, it’s not that surprising that as a nation we are proud to support British restaurants. 1. British . 2. Indian . 3. Italian . 4. Chinese . 5. Gastro Pub . 6. Thai . 7. American . 8. Mexican . 9. French . 10. Sushi/Japanese . 'Thankfully things have changed dramatically since the days when scampi and chips was the most exotic thing on the menu in UK pubs and restaurants!' In addition to selecting British food as their cuisine of choice, over 70% of people said they have a favourite local restaurant they frequent regularly. In terms of frequency of dining out, 18-24-year-olds are the most avid restaurant-goers, with nearly 30 per cent dining out several times a month, compared to 16 per cent of those aged 45-54. Interestingly, of all adults polled, 18-24-year-olds are the least enamoured with British food – just 14 per cent chose it as their favourite. British Food Fortnight runs from 20th September to 5th October.","Travelzoo reviewed British-themed restaurants around the world .

"Australia's Family Feud has been slammed by viewers who have labelled the game show 'sexist' after it asked contestants to name women's jobs and revealed answers that included doing the dishes, cooking and washing clothes. The line of questioning came from host Grant Denyer on Wednesday night and caused an uproar on social media. The premise of the Channel Ten show involves two families playing off against each other to name the top eight responses given to a series of questions by 100 Australians. Scroll down for video . Family Feud Australia contestants were asked to name what people thought were suitable jobs for women . When the answers were unveiled to include cooking, cleaning, nursing, hairdressing, domestic duties, doing the dishes, being a receptionist and washing clothes, social media sites exploded with viewer outrage. Emma Jo-Anne wrote on Channel Ten's Facebook page to express her disgust. 'Not sure what year it was, when I turned on Family Feud I could have sworn it was 1950,' she said. 'There is no such thing as a ""man's job"" or a ""woman's job"". The Channel Ten show is hosted by Grant Denyer - a former Sunrise weatherman on Channel Seven . 'It's incidents like this that stop us bridging the gender equality gap. 'Women can do whatever we want, as can men. Please think next time before you do something that shows such a narrow minded view of society.' While Melanie Tee was equally unhappy. 'Am so glad my kids didn't see this rubbish. Needs to be on a (sic) earlier timeslot....like 1952.....#familyfeud #sexism,' she tweeted. Viewers took to social media to express their outrage at the segment . Social media users took to Twitter and Facebook and labelled the move 'sexist' Steve Williams offered up a man's perspective on the Family Feud Australia gaffe . While Sarah Furtner used sarcasm to express her displeasure . Some people labelled the answers to the question as outdated, saying the show needed to go back to the 1950s . Jac_mccusker wrote: 'Wow #familyfeud such sexism tonight?' And Steve Williams shared a male perspective on the situation. 'Interesting grab for publicity @FamilyFeudAU ... ""Name a woman's job?"" It's 2014. Enjoy your publicity,' he said. Earlier in the night, Family Feud also asked contestants to name what people thought was a man's job. Answers included building, mowing the lawn, taking out the bins, being a mechanic and a tradie, plumbing, doing carpentry and fixing things. A Channel 10 spokeswoman said: 'Network Ten apologises for including two questions relating to what people think is a man’s job and a woman’s job in the episode of Family Feud which aired last night on Network Ten. 'The questions were ill advised and should not have been included in the show. The survey results are determined by 100 people and we understand they are not reflective of all Australians.'","Answers to the question included cooking, doing the dishes and cleaning .

"'The couple of weeks that I came back I really struggled - my fiancé said, ""You are different"" - I was very negative, crying a lot, struggling with a sense of sad lonely souls. 'How do you write something that means so much to them?' Kumi Taguchi, a journalist from the ABC told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Taguchi spent two weeks inside a specialised rehabilitation hospital for returning war veterans who suffer from sever Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Her mental state was put to the test after soldiers allowed her access to their deepest, darkest, secrets and fears they just could not shake. Kumi Taguchi, a journalist from the ABC spent two weeks inside a specialised rehabilitation hospital for returning war veterans who suffer from sever Post Traumatic Stress Disorder . Ms Taguchi, who is passionate about mental health and studies of the mind spent a year pursuing entry inside Ward 17 at the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital in Melbourne . Ms Taguchi, who is passionate about mental health and studies of the mind, spent a year pursuing entry inside Ward 17 at the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital in Melbourne. During her time she spoke with six men who are suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after coming back from war. Their stories of isolation and loneliness hit home for the ABC News 24 Presenter who said she just 'could not stand the thought of people being lonely'. Faced with the dilemma to report like a journalist while trying to protect the soldiers, Ms Taguchi knew it would be a difficult journey. She also knew the objective of the clinicians at Ward 17 was to protect the war veterans, firefighters, emergency workers and police who are suffering from sever PTSD. 'The PR guy didn't want me to pitch a story - he just wanted to know who I was, so I spent lots of time speaking with him so he could get to know me,' she said. 'By the end of it he said, ""I think you and I are going to get a long"" and so he organised me to meet with people who work there - we spoke on how to deal with privacy, and trust I'd not bang down doors'. Ward 17 is a critical point where war soldiers who can no longer cope with their PTSD seek help. There is an in-ward and an out-ward . Only men have been through the in-ward at the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital in Melbourne . Ms Taguchi and the hospital workers came to the decision that the best way to understand the veterans would be to spend a long period of time in the hospital - two weeks. 'It wasn't at all confronting in the way some people think it was - there weren't people shouting and crying or patients so messed up that they weren't able to function. 'You imagine a big room with beds lined up but it's not like that all - it's peaceful'. Ward 17 is a critical point where war soldiers who can no longer cope with their PTSD seek help. There is an in-ward and an out-ward. The out-ward is where suffers can seek specialised help without sleeping there and the in-ward is where they spend nights. Only men have been through the in-ward. Ms Taguchi witnessed the steps clinicians took to help these soldiers get their life back . 'Two women were in an out-ward program. I saw them but they did not want to speak', Ms Taguchi said. 'There are two theories;  women are dealing with their mental illness or stress better than men, or that women are not dealing with it but thinking that they are dealing with it.' Walking into the hospital with only pen and paper, Ms Taguchi had no agenda but after talking to the six men aged between 29 and 50 the issue of identity proved to be a reoccurring theme amongst the soldiers. 'When you can't let go of that identity, you are forever looking back in time,' she said. Ms Taguchi made a point to the men living in the ward that they were under no obligation to speak with her, leaving it completely up to them. Before speaking with the veterans Ms Taguchi had no idea how opened they would be. 'Psychologists told me, ""once they trust you, you will be trusted by them for life"", and it was true - their honesty was so raw from the point where it was unbelievably brave and much more honest than I or anyone I know would be. 'I was amazed at how broken they were, how lost they felt, how lonely they felt and hopeless they felt - I had tears in my eyes,' she said. 'A lot of them struggled with sacrifice - feeling like they weren't worthy to suffer because they have never been fought on the front-line.' One of the men she spoke with was a young man she named Tim. She said he had a sense of 'utter loneliness' which broke her heart. 'He didn't think he had anything to say but if you read his CV you would think it was like a spy novel. 'He is a highly trained young man who sat there opposite me with shaggy hair and a beard. He said he wanted to put nicer clothes on because he had no interaction with anyone - only his mum and his psychologist. 'I saw a young man, fit and handsome who was could be on top of the world.' What really struck a cord with Ms Taguchi was the amount of courage every veteran had. 'I would ask them, ""Do you realise how courageous it is to tell a story? It isn't only on a battlefield"" - but they couldn't see that.' Ms Taguchi witnessed the steps clinicians took to help these soldiers get their life back. She said they worked with the men to help confront anger, disappointment, guilt, sadness and acknowledging that these notions are valid and need to be addressed. Walking into the hospital with only pen and paper, Ms Taguchi had no agenda but after talking to six men aged between 29 and 50 the issue of identity proved to be a reoccurring theme amongst the soldiers . Ms Taguchi said, 'It wasn't at all confronting in the way some people think it was - there weren't people shouting and crying or patients so messed up that they weren't able to function' 'It gave them a platform to start to address their lives', she said. 'A number of guys said this place saved me, without this place I wouldn't be here,' Ms Taguchi said. She told Daily Mail Australia listening to these men speak so highly of Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital raised the question of whether Australia needs more places dedicated to veterans. 'We only have one more place in Adelaide which works with veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.' The ABC reported 96 Australian Defence Force members and 13 veterans have committed suicide since 2000. Ms Taguchi admits when she returned back to Sydney after her two weeks in Melbourne life was tough. 'I realised it really got to me,' she said. 'As a journalist you are meant to write a story and then move on.' 'I recognised symptoms within myself - you have to get your mental health to a point where it is quite resilient. 'I got to a point where I couldn't write - I had to reset what I thought it was to be a journalist and look after my own health - plus I had a deadline.' 96 Australian Defence Force members and 13 veterans have committed suicide since 2000 . Ms Taguchi said Australia has only have one more place in Adelaide which works with veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder . Ms Taguchi's unique online report captured the daily struggles soldiers face when returning home from war. She said a lot of the soldiers were relieved that the story was treated sensitively and honestly. 'I received some very sad texts from the soldiers saying it was great to tell their story and it also made them realise how tough their life really is. 'A guy [soldier] texted me after it was published saying thank you so much for letting people know about their struggles.'

"Vital help for elderly people will be restricted to only those who need help with two tasks or more, the Government said last night. Councils have been told to provide home helps and other assistance only if people are unable to complete two or more essential daily tasks. If they are unable to do only one of the 10 appointed tasks they should receive no help from their council – meaning they would have to pay for care themselves or do without it. Criteria: New rules say elderly people will need two or more 'care needs' before qualifying for assistance . Charities said as many as 340,000 who need help would fail to get it under the new rules. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said the future looked ‘bleak’ for older people. ‘Every day there is another horror story of an older person failed by the system and sadly things will not improve until the social care funding gap is filled', she said. 'Politicians in every party need to recognise this and commit to action as an urgent priority.’ The ten activities listed are: managing and maintaining nutrition, maintaining personal hygiene, managing toilet needs, being appropriately clothed, being able to make use of their home safely, maintaining a habitable home environment, maintaining family or other personal relationships, accessing work, using public transport, and looking after a child. Under the present system, most councils restrict care to those with ‘substantial’ or ‘critical’ needs – meaning they are at risk of ending up in hospital without care. The Coalition’s new ‘national eligibility criteria’ – a minimum threshold of care that councils have to provide – says the elderly should get care if their needs arise from a physical or mental impairment, if they are unable to achieve two or more activities, and if this failure is likely to have a ‘significant impact on wellbeing’. Warning: While many receive excellent care, charities said 'horror stories' would continue (posed by models) Richard Hawkes, chairman of the Care and Support Alliance, said: ‘The Care Act will only live up to its promise of a genuinely preventative system that promotes wellbeing, if the government re-thinks its plans to exclude so many older and disabled people from the system. ‘Setting a high threshold for the care system is a bit like going to the doctor with a chest infection and being told to come back with pneumonia. ‘Every day, our 76 organisations hear horror stories of older and disabled people who struggle to get the support they need to simply get up, get dressed and get out of the house. 1 Managing and maintaining nutrition . 2 Maintaining personal hygiene . 3 Managing toilet needs . 4 Being appropriately clothed . 5 Being able to make use of their house safely . 6 Maintaining a habitable home environment . 7 Developing and maintaining family or other personal relationships . 8 Accessing and engaging in work, training, education or volunteering . 9 Making use of necessary facilities or services in the local community including public transport, and recreational facilities or services . 10 Carrying out any caring responsibilities the adult has for a child . ‘The only long-term solution to the care crisis is an increase in funding, and – as the Barker Commission experts rightly argue – as a country we can afford it. In fact we can’t afford not to.’ Neil Duncan-Jordan, from the National Pensioners Convention, said: ‘People were expecting a better deal from the Coalition after all the promises. Many older people and their families will be very angry and disappointed about this.‘This isn’t about improving services and looking after people who desperately need support. ‘The whole thing is a con. The Coalition said they were going to fix social care but they’re making things worse. They’re cutting money from social care, so they’re restricting eligibility. It’s cynical.’ A Department of Health spokesman said the new rules were designed to be the same as the ‘substantial’ threshold. ‘Helping people to live independently and prevent them from becoming ill is what people want and is a better use of our resources,’ she said. ‘The Care Act and our £3.8billion Better Care Fund will focus on keeping people well, which can save money and prevent people needing more support. 'We are clear that people, whatever their level of need, will receive help from their council to get support and information.’ She added officials had asked the Care and Support Alliance to come up with examples of people who only had one care need – and they could not come up with one.","Charities attacked new criteria announced by the Government last night .

"When Garth Brooks turned 50 two years ago, he planned to mark his half century birthday by jumping out of a plane and parachuting to the ground. But his worrywart wife, Trisha Yearwood, put the kibosh on his plans, fearing he’d end up with the one parachute that wouldn't open. So when Brooks found out about a place where he could actually experience the adrenalin-charged sensation of making that leap, only in a totally safe environment, he jumped at the chance. Birdman: Garth Brooks was all set to go sky-diving two years ago on his 50th, but Trisha Yearwood grounded her country star husband. But where there's a will there's a way . Suspense!  Brooks comes in for landing aided by instructor Christian Rosas at iFLY in Rosemont, Illinois . ‘Garth was all set to go sky-diving two years ago on his 50th, but Trish had a fit when she heard about his birthday plans,’ says a source close to the couple. ‘She pleaded with him to stay grounded, and not wanting to upset her he agreed. Then last month, when he and Trish were in Rosemont, Illinois for their Garth Brooks World Tour with Trisha Yearwood, someone in his camp told him about this place called iFLY where, after just a brief training session, you can experience what it feels like to jump out of plane. 'He was gung-ho to give it a go, ’ says the friend. ‘Garth tried to convince Trisha to join him but she wasn’t interested, however a few of his crew members were anxious to take the plunge, so he treated them all to the $69.95 session, which allowed them to experience two, 60 second jumps and receive a certificate saying they’d done the deed.' Hanging out: Garth took a leap of faith thanks to  iFLY instructors Kevin Drivas, Christian Rosas, Garet Bloodworth and Cortney Bedeker . Don't do it! Trisha Yearwood was sure hubby Garth's parachute would fail if he did the real thing . The facility, located just a couple miles from where Trisha and Garth performed, uses the same type of fans that are used by the military when they train their paratroopers. ‘The iFLY experience is made possible utilizing a technology called the “vertical wind tunnel,” which was historically used by military and professional skydivers for training,’ iFlY’s spokesperson, Alexandra Jakubiak, tells Mail Online exclusively. Four powerful, high-efficiency axial fans are mounted at the top of the building, channeling air down the side tunnels into the basement, and then up through the floor through a 14-foot-wide circular flight chamber, creating a strong upward draft. ‘This column of air, which ranges in speed from approximately 80 to 175 miles per hour (depending on the weight and expertise level of the flyer), creates a stable, safe, wall-to-wall airflow that gently pushes guests aloft and makes it possible for them to fly. Garth and his friends put on flight suits, goggles and helmets, and they had a great time,’ says Jakubiak. 'Garth happily posed for photos and signed autographs, and we certainly hope to see them all back again soon.’","Garth Brooks has been dreaming of going skydiving for years .

"Along the Turkish border hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees listen to the distant pop of shells and rattle of machine-gun fire as ISIS renewed its attacks on their home city of Kobani today. Between 140,000 and 180,000 ethnic Kurds have so far left the city for the safety of Turkey, fearing another massacre if Islamic State militants overrun the peshmerga fighters protecting them. While the evacuation has been largely peaceful so far, today clashes erupted between armed Turkish police and Kurdish refugees as they tried to march back to the border and stage a protest, no longer able to bear  the sound of the fighting. Tension: Turkish police use tear gas to disperse 200 Kurdish protesters marching towards Syrian border to protest against attacks by the Islamic State . Heavy armour: Soldiers sat nearby watching the protests while carrying riot shields, rifles and wearing gas masks as tension rise along the border . Fleeing: Between 140,000 and 160,000 Kurdish refugees have fled the town of Kobani fearing a massacre if ISIS fighters defeat the peshmerga soldiers defending them . Protest: Kurdish activists had attempted to get to the border to protest against attacks by Islamic State after listening to days of fighting in their home city nearby . Guards in body-armour and helmets were forced to use tear gas to drive a group of around 200 desperate demonstrators back behind Turkish lines. There has been a heavily military presence along the Turkish side of border all week, including tanks, armoured vehicles and soldiers carrying machine guns as they attempt to keep the peace. There have also been fears that Kurdish extremists, who have previously staged attacks on the country while demanding their own state, might use the refugee crisis as cover to cross the border. Kobani and the surrounding area has been under attack by militants since mid-September as fighters seized surrounding villages, while the city itself has been shelled for the last three days. Fighting: Clashes broke out along the Syrian border today where tensions have been rising following days of ISIS attacks on the Kurdish town of Kobani . Crowd control: A Turkish Gendarmerie fires tear gas towards 200 activists who attempted to gather along the border with Syria today . Clashes: Turkish officials have previously said they fear Kurdish militants, who have previously staged attacks against their country, will use the refugee crisis as a reason to cross the border before launching fresh assaults . Desperation: Elderly Kurds walk though clouds of tear gas near the Syrian border today after staging protests against ISIS attacks on their hometown . Fierce: There have been clashes in Kobani since mid-September as fighters from the Islamic State try to capture the last crossing point along Syria's border with Turkey . Senior Kurdish official Asya Abdullah said: 'Clashes continue now, they are shelling on all three fronts. They tried to invade Kobani last night but they were repelled. We think they are planning to launch another big attack but [we are] prepared to resist them.' Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria's leading Kurdish Democratic Union Party, said the militants had failed to capture a strategic hill overlooking the city despite launching five attacks on it. He added that U.S.-led airstrikes were having 'a positive impact' after a bombing raid on Friday killed an estimated five militants and destroyed one vehicle heading to attack. Elsewhere today another 30 ISIS fighters were reported to have been killed after airstrikes on the eastern city of Shaddadeh where the Islamist group have a strong foothold. Airstrikes: As clashes erupted along the border today, five ISIS fighters were reported to have been killed in a U.S. bombing raid near Kobani overnight on Friday . Resistance: Kurdish forces inside Kobani say they are ready to resist ISIS forces, claiming that the Islamists have failed to capture a strategic hill overlooking the city . New arrival: A confused-looking Kurdish man crosses the police line along the Turkish border after fleeing the ISIS attacks on nearby Kobani . Lookout: A Turkish soldier keeps watch for ISIS forces which can be heard fighting to capture the town of Kobani just a short distance away from the border . Conflict: Turkey has  been reluctant to become involved with the situation in Iraq and Syria but is slowly being dragged into the war as refugees pour across the border . It was the first time Shaddadeh was struck since the U.S.-led campaign began nearly two weeks ago. There was no immediate confirmation on the strikes or casualties from Washington. About 30 explosions were heard in and near Shaddadeh on Friday night, according to an activist in Hassakeh province, who added that the targets included several buildings occupied by Islamic State fighters. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists around Syria, said as many as 30 fighters from the Islamic State group were killed in the airstrikes on Shaddadeh. It said all the dead were foreign fighters. Shelling: Sources inside Kobani have reported that ISIS are using heavy weapons to attack on three fronts today, the third day the city has been shelled . Explosion: Kurdish fighters say the main focus of the shelling has been the southwest edge of the city, as they prepare to repel any Islamic State advance . Looking on: Turkish police and troops sit on top of an armoured personnel carrier as the sound of clashes between Kurdish and ISIS forces can be heard . Guarding: Turkey has maintained a strong military presence along the border for the last few weeks as the conflict with ISIS draws closer to its borders . Death toll: Five militants were killed and one vehicle destroyed in the area surrounding Kobani overnight on Friday in a U.S airstrike . Meanwhile in the Syrian capital of Damascus, Bashar al-Assad was seen in a rare public appearance as he joined in Eid al-Adha at the al-Numan Bin Bashir mosque. During Syria's civil war, which is now in its fourth year and which activists say has killed more than 190,000 people, Assad has been largely sheltered from the public eye. The last time he was seen in public was in July, when he attended prayers for the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which marks the end of fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Desperate: As the number of refugees at Turkey's border grows, another 30 militants were reported to have been killed in the east of Syria in a U.S.-led strike .

"An effigy of Alex Salmond was set alight at a bonfire parade last night - despite claims it had been blocked by police - and EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso is next. Proposals to burn the Scottish First Minister in Lewes, East Sussex, sparked outrage and a complaint was made to police - but pictures emerged online today showing one of the models at the centre of a fireworks display. One effigy had the politician standing at 16ft tall and holding a sign reading '45%', which refers to the proportion of Scottish people who voted for independence from the UK in September, while the Loch Ness Monster peers over his shoulder. Scroll down for video . The effigy of Alex Salmond was set alight at a bonfire parade in Lewes, East Sussex, last night despite claims it had been blocked . Proposals to burn the Scottish First Minister in Lewes, East Sussex, sparked outrage and a complaint was made to police - but pictures emerged online today showing one of the models at the centre of a fireworks display . Images that appeared on social media appeared to show the effigy go up in flames as fireworks went off at the display in East Sussex . The second model portrayed a topless Mr Salmond wearing a kilt and sitting on a bucket of North Sea oil. A number of societies take part in the parade, each providing their own effigies, costumes, bonfire sites and procession route within the town. The caricatures of Mr Salmon were made by the Waterloo Bonfire Society, which said it had 'no wish or intention to offend'. Sussex Police said last night that complaints had been raised and tweeted: 'For those enquiring we have been advised that there won't be any burning of the Alex Salmond effigies this evening in Lewes.' However, tweets from Michael Story posted at the end of the parade appeared to show the kilt-wearing effigy exploding in a puff of black smoke amid a fireworks display. Mr Story wrote: 'To be absolutely clear: tonight I saw an effigy of Alex Salmond lit by fireworks then blown up at Lewes.' An embarrassed and shocked looking 'Alex Salmond' is paraded through Lewes, Sussex on his way to the bonfire yesterday evening . Sussex Police is looking at a number of complaints about the portrayal of Mr Salmond as an effigy and is 'trying to establish whether or not any crime may have been committed'. A spokeswoman for the force added: 'Officers spoke to the bonfire societies on the night to make them aware of the concerns being raised about the effigies of the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. 'It was left up to the societies to make a decision about what they did with the effigies.' High-profile politicians and celebrities have been targets of the parade in the past. Television presenter and journalist Piers Morgan tried to soften the blow by tweeting: 'Don't take this Lewes bonfire thing too personally @AlexSalmond - they burned me too.' Mr Salmond said: 'I'm in pretty good company - Angela Merkel got the burning treatment from the East Sussex Conservative council. 'I think their judgment is askew but if they think I'm a threat to the Westminster establishment like Guy Fawkes, they are right. 'I am used to insults from Tories in East Sussex and if they think that is a good thing to do it is up to them.' He added that he was more concerned about Nessie being burned and said it that was 'totally outrageous'. The effigy of EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso is due to be burnt in Edenbridge, Kent, on Saturday as part of the bonfire celebrations . Bonfire Night in Lewes does not only commemorate the Gunpowder Plot, but also other events including the burning of 17 Protestant martyrs in the town's High Street from 1555 to 1557 under the reign of Mary Tudor. The local authority posted an image of the effigy from their official Twitter account, depicting the politician holding a 45 per cent panel in a jibe over the referendum result. The tweet read: 'A sneak preview of Alex Salmond and Nessie ahead of tonight's bonfire in Lewes - it just rolled up at County Hall.' The bonfire night celebrations in Lewes, East Sussex, are thought to be the largest in the world, where a variety of societies parade through the streets. In previous years the town has burned controversial figures ranging from terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, Popes and the German chancellor Angela Merkel. Meanwhile in Edenbridge, Kent, this year's 'celebrity guy' has been unveiled as the former European Commission President ahead of bonfire celebrations on Saturday. Another effigy of the Scottish First Minister sparked outrage yesterday afternoon as it was carried through the streets of Lewes, East Sussex . The Edenbridge Bonfire Society has been poking fun at the famous for nearly 20 years by building and exploding a 10 metre tall effigy alongside their traditional figure of Guy Fawkes. Bonfire society member Jon Mitchell said the decision came down to Mr Barroso's demand that Britain pay an extra £1.7 billion to the European Union. He said: 'We do try very hard to pick somebody who's absolutely current in the news. 'We only made the decision on Tuesday of last week and we started building Jose on the Thursday.' Speculation as to who this year's guys would be began when William Hill named Top Gear's Jeremy Clarkson as the favourite. But Mr Mitchell said other public opinion polls pointed towards Scottish National Party Leader Alex Salmond - who was the planned effigy in Sussex - and Katie Hopkins, a former contestant on The Apprentice, whose effigy was burnt by the Kent-based society last year. Mr Mitchell said: 'It was a difficult one to decide as there was no clear favourite. We eliminated people one by one and were left with Jose. 'There were a lot of people who wanted us to burn Katie Hopkins again but she's put all that weight on so building her would have been a lot of extra work.' This year the focus was placed on the First Minister and Scotland's mysterious and much-loved national treasure, Nessie . The Edenbridge society's famous faces  have included Tony and Cherie Blair, Gordon Brown, Edwina Currie, John Prescott, Mario Balotelli, Wayne Rooney, Lance Armstrong, Russell Brand, Katie Price, Jacques Chirac and even Saddam Hussein. But this year the focus for Lewes - in England - was placed on the First Minister and Scotland's mysterious and much-loved national treasure, Nessie. The mock-up was set up by one of the town's groups, the Waterloo Bonfire Society, which is celebrating its 50th year after being formed in 1964. But furious Scots took to social media to vent their anger at what they believed was an attack on everyone who voted in favour of independence. Cybernat Wings Over Scotland tweeted: 'In fairness, Salmond WAS attempting through democratic means something akin to what Guy Fawkes tried with gunpowder. 'But still it's just hilarious to imagine the reaction if it was the other way round.' Mhairi Hunter tweeted: 'Let's imagine for one second what would happen if an SNP-run Council burned an effigy of David Cameron. Lordy' User JordMclean85 tweeted: 'What did poor Nessie do to deserve this though?' An East Sussex County Council worker, who did not give his name, said: 'Well this actually happens every year and it happens to political figures and people who have in the news. 'I wouldn't read into it as it happens every year.' An effigy of Alec Salmond is pulled along Lewes High St, Lewes, West Sussex, by the Waterloo Bonfire Society, in preparation for the bonfire procession festivities in Lewes town. A complaint from a member of the public stopped the burning going ahead . Burning pope: The victim of the bonfire in 2011 was an effigy of the pope. Other previous effergies include Piers Morgan . On Saturday, Carlisle City council doused its plans to burn an effigy of Mary, Queen of Scots on a mock-up of Carlisle Castle where she was imprisoned, after it sparked outrage. Several councillors complained and member of the public branded the idea insensitive and disrespectful so soon after the referendum bid. When asked for comment, a spokesman for East Sussex Council Council said: 'The image was just a shot as something unusual passed the building and it has no connection to us at all. 'It is owned by Waterloo Bonfire Society and has no connection to the council whatsoever.' East Sussex County Council later removed the photo from Twitter and posted a response saying: 'Please note that the Alex Salmond and Nessie models were created by Waterloo Bonfire Society #LewesBonfire and have NO connection to ESCC.' A spokesman for Alex Salmond's constituency office said: 'It's not our place to comment on it.' A spokesman for the First Minister said: 'The Tory-controlled East Sussex County Council obviously view the First Minister - and the 45 per cent of Scots who voted Yes - as big a threat to the Westminster establishment as Guy Fawkes, although it's unclear why poor Nessie has been targeted. Juniors start off the evening's Tar Barrels at Ottery St Mary in Devon which finishes in the town square at midnight . 'It's a typical Tory attitude to Scotland, whether north or south of the border.' It is not the first time that Bonfire Night has caused controversy at Lewes. In 2003, residents burned a caravan with pictures of Gypsies painted on it in Firle, a village in Lewes. The vehicle bore the number plate P1KEY. Meanwhile, in Ottery St Mary in Devon the locals wearing gloves made out of sacks carried flaming tar barrels around the town. The tradition of the Tar Barrel is probably around 400 years old. The original procession had the barrels being pushed by locals but then they decided that was rather wimpy so they changed to carrying them on their shoulders. Ottery is the only town in the country carrying full sized lighted tar barrels through the streets. Seventeen barrels are carried throughout the day beginning in the afternoon. The barrels come in different sizes, small for the boys, medium for the women and youths, and 'gert big unz' for the men. Traditionally, the barrels are set alight at various pubs and hotels around the town and a tight agenda is followed until the last barrel is taken into the square around midnight.

Investigators would not say if the two had sex during the boy's stay. Tiffany Pagan, 25, worked at an alternative education facility in Rutland. On Wednesday, she was charged with one count of child luring. 'Predator': Tiffany Pagan, 25,  has been charged with one count of child luring for allegedly engaging in sexually explicit communication on Facebook with a 15-year-old boy attending a school for troubled kids . Police said they began investigating the Clarendon resident in July after the Department for Children and Families in Rutland received a complaint about her conduct. Rutland City Public Schools Assistant Superintendent Rob Bliss told the Burlington Free Press Pagan worked for less than a full school year at the Allen Street Campus - an alternative school for children in grades 6-12 who require structured learning and support due to emotional difficulties.

"Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has opened up about dealing with those who 'detest' him and his fractious relationship with David Cameron. As the Lib Dems today met in Glasgow for their autumn conference, Mr Clegg spoke of being misled by the Tories, Ukip's growing threat and his own parties sliding numbers, being ridiculed and calls for his resignation. But far from feeling defeated, Mr Clegg said it had only made him stronger. Nick Clegg applauds during the Lib Dems conference in Glagow today; the Deputy Prime Minister has spoken out about those who 'detest' him and how it has helped him develop a thicker skin . Mr Clegg described the beginning of his political career as being 'quite a baptism of fire' 'Of course there are people who detest me, on left and right, I wouldn't be doing my job if they didn't. But you are toughened up after four and a half years. I've got a thicker skin.' Mr Clegg told The Times. He said the beginning of his political career was, 'quite a baptism of fire' and he was being 'flayed alive' in the media everyday. 'I wouldn't wish those six months on my worst enemy. 'It was not pleasant but I'm much more comfortable in my skin now about what I'm doing and clear about what I want to do next. In the end, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' For three years the Lib Dems have been resisting Tory attempts to freeze benefits, and now Mr Clegg says the Conservations are becoming merciless and 'wielding the axe'  at those who are living in poverty. His comments follow a speech by George Osborne, where he said the rich shouldn't have to pay any extra to reduce of the deficit. At the conference Mr Clegg, right, pledged an extra £1 billion in funding for the NHS . Mr Clegg, seen here meeting candidates, said he hoped to retain his party seats by securing the middle ground between the views held by George Osborne and Ed Miliband . He said the Tories need restraining, and if they get into government on their own the 'poor will get poorer' and there will be cuts to essential services like the police, social care and public services - because they won't use taxation. Mr Clegg said he felt let down by the Tories who had almost 'muted' almost out of recognition and now didn't stand for any of the things he thought united them as a coalition. They were in a 'blind panic' over Ukip, he said. The betrayal and division between the parties became very personal and public this week when Theresa May accused Mr Clegg of putting children's lives at risk by blocking the snooper's charter. While once the parties were allies, they were now political enemies. Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron were never best mates, he said. Mr Clegg rubbished David Cameron's efforts on the environment - a 'pale green spray-paint job' - and his proposal to seize the passports of returning jihadists, which 'is never going to happen'. Mr Clegg said he and David Cameron were never best mates, and he rubbished the Prime Minister's efforts on the environment and his proposal to seize the passports of returning jihadists . And he won't support the Prime Minister's plan to introduce English votes for English laws. Although the Lib Dems could lose half their seats at the next election, Mr Clegg believes he can hold on to them by seizing the middle ground that exists between Mr Osborne and Ed Miliband political positions. Today, at the Lib Dem conference, Mr Clegg pledged an extra £1 billion a year for the NHS and plans to pressure the chancellor to release more funds for the health service. Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems had been knocked-back a lot, but many of their ideas had been picked-up along the way. The Tories adopted his plan to raise the tax threshold to £12,500, and the mansion tax, although Mr Clegg has further refined the idea to include levies on the most expensive homes. Despite the souring of the coalition-coupling, Mr Clegg said they would remain together until May.","Nick Clegg has described his early days of politics like a 'baptism of fire'

"A 56-year-old 'Teacher of the Year' lured one of his 14-year-old students with a fake Facebook profile before raping her in his car, it has been claimed. Joaquim Andrade, who teaches English at Brockton High School in Massachusetts, allegedly engaged the teenager in conversation about soccer via the popular social networking site. He then reportedly drove to her home, picked her up and traveled to another location, where he sexually assaulted her. The attack took place on October 7 off school grounds, it is alleged. Andrade was arraigned on Friday and charged with the rape of a child with force, the enticement of a child, indecent assault and battery on a child over 14, Plymouth County District Attorney's Office said. Charged: High school teacher Joaquim Andrade, 56, allegedly lured a 14-year-old female student with a fake Facebook profile before raping her in his car. Above, the suspect is seen during his arraignment on Friday . The father-of-four, who has been voted the school's 'Teacher of the Year' twice in the past seven years, is being held on $20,000 bail and denies the charges, Brockton Enterprise News reported. Andrade, who began teaching at the school in 1993, allegedly contacted the student on Facebook after teaching her in his ninth-grade 'English as a Second Language' class. Following the alleged assault, he reportedly  dropped her off at a soccer game with his phone number, alongside a false name to put in her phone. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, reported the allegations to school officials on October 10, prompting a three-week-long investigation by Brockton police. School: Andrade, a married father of four, teaches 'English as a Second Language' at Brockton High School (pictured) in Massachusetts. He has been voted 'Teacher of the Year' twice in the past seven years . Social network: The suspect allegedly engaged the teenager in conversation about soccer via Facebook (file picture). He then reportedly drove to her home in Brockton, picked her up and sexually assaulted her . During the inquiry, Andrade was placed on administrative leave. On Friday, School Superintendent Kathleen Smith said the situation has not changed despite his charges. The teacher, who hails from Cape Verde in West Africa, has rights, 'both in regard to the court system and in regard to his employment status,' Ms Smith said. But she added: 'Rest assured, however, that the Brockton Public Schools will deal with this situation as aggressively as it can,' should his status change.' Andrade's arrest has shocked parents at the school, who were notified of the investigation as soon as the charges against the 23-year teacher, soccer coach and mentor emerged. Rich Cogliano, whose child attends the institution, told WCVB: 'It's something you'd never expect in a school environment. You pray it would never happen.' Wendy Murphy, a nationally recognized expert on sex crimes and child abuse, added that sometimes a teacher who seems too good to be true 'is' too good to be true. Investigation: If Andrade posts bail, he will be required to surrender his passport, keep away from the alleged victim and avoid unsupervised contact with children under  17. Above Andrade's Brockton home . The city's elected leaders are offering support to the teenager. School administrators have also been working with the victim and her family, Ms Smith said.

"Four hikers and a young, unconscious girl were saved from deadly rising tides after they formed a human chain and were airlifted to safety. The walkers were on the coast by Fogarty Creek state park, Oregon, on Saturday when the tide started drawing in, trapping them off-shore. There were initially eight people in the group - but three jumped into the freezing water and managed to swim to shore, while the others waited for rescue. Scroll down for videos . Rescue: The hikers gathered on a rock away from the waves after stumbling there in a human chain. One of the walkers (circled) waits for an airlift . Video shot from the shore shows the remaining walkers stumbling through the waves - clinging to one another for safety. They appear to be carrying one of their number, who is shorter than the other walkers. The bystander, who passed the footage to the KATU news channel, said she was a girl and had passed out. They fled away from the shore onto higher ground due to the oncoming waves. They eventually scrambled up onto a rocky outcrop, where they could wait for rescue. To safety: After linking arms to survive the high swell pulling at their bodies, the walkers were lifted away by the Coast Guard. One girl, who had passed out during the struggle with the sea, was taken to hospital . Rough weather: The helicopter rescue might not have been possible were the craft stationed further away, the local fire department chief warned . The group was saved when a Coast Guard helicopter swooped in. Each of them was pictured being airlifted away from the rocks. One of the rescued walkers was flown to hospital. The others seemed to be unharmed. The rescue was carried out by a Coast Guard helicopter from the nearby Newport station - which is controversially due to close at the end of November, moving the helicopter much further away. Depoe Bay Fire Chief Joshua L. Williams suggested the rescue could have gone very differently without the nearby chopper. He said: 'There were five frightened, cold, wet people stranded on those rocks, I needed a helo here in 10 minutes, not an hour. 'We depend on the USCG helo.

The jobs Miss Covington gets booked for vary in scope enormously; from two-hour shoots to 18-hour marathons with huge pythons wrapped around her arms, or caressing the torsos of male models. One of her more memorable encounters with a man was a job she shot with comedian Andy Sandberg. 'I had my arm slithering up his tuxedo shirt sleeve and my hand on his face,' she recalls. 'It seems like an easy job. Until you try it.' Precious: Miss Covington has to consider every move she makes. 'How I open a car door, how I pick up a box, even where my hands swing when I'm walking down the street,' she says . Precautions: Miss Covington, a photography enthusiast herself, wears sunglasses in the studio to protect against the bright lights (left) and all but her hands are hidden (right) Fell into it: Miss Covington's hands were first discovered while she working as a waitress, by an agent who snapped her up, and sparked her long and successful career . Miss Covington spent many of her earlier years sitting in front of a mirror and practicing positions. 'You have to have steady hands, and you have to be able to repeat small motions over and over with perfect precision.' Take a pizza commercial for example. A crew will spend hours painstakingly choreographing what will turn out to be a three-second shot. 'So in I come, the rest of my body at a bizarre angle so it's hidden out of the way, and then I wait for the crew to call action,' she explains. 'Then I smoothly pick up the slice of pizza - again and again - until that cheese stretch is the best cheese stretch in the history of cheese stretches.' Patience: 'You have to have steady hands, and you have to be able to repeat small motions over and over with perfect precision,' Miss Covington explains . Dedication: She spent many of her earlier years sitting in front of a mirror and practicing positions . How it's done: 'Extra virgin olive oil is my not-so-secret weapon,' she says. 'I carry it with me and slather it on under my gloves wherever I go' Miss Covington suspects a lot of her success is down to her patience, practice and the speed with which she can get the shot perfect. 'One job I did for Miller Lite required me to push six beer bottles across the table and have them spin so the label stopped in front of the camera,' she says. 'My body was out of the shot and the set-up meant I couldn't even see my hands. But I practiced it enough times before the shoot that, incredibly, I nailed it on the first take.' In addition to leading most of her life wearing gloves and avoiding - at all costs - breaking a nail, moisturizing is key in keeping Miss Covington's hands camera-ready. 'Extra virgin olive oil is my not-so-secret weapon. I carry it with me and slather it on under my gloves wherever I go,' she reveals. The face behind the hands! Miss Covington (pictured) is also a professional photographer . 'That, and a soap line I discovered called Pure Harmony. It's the best soap I have ever found for nourishing my skin and keeping it squeaky clean.' Finally, she works out and keeps her arms fit. 'It’s very important so that I can hold products with my arm outstretched - think Warrior Pose for hours on end - without shaking or showing signs of strain,' she says. 'My wrists must be veinless!' She may have fallen into this unusual career by chance, but did Miss Covington always know she had nice hands, even growing up? 'Not at all,' she remarks. 'I do remember my grandmother's hands though. 'She had beautiful long fingers and her nails were always perfectly polished with a dark red. 'After I was booked on my first job, I called my mom to tell her and she laughed. 'Turns out my grandmother was a hand model for typewriters in the 1930's. 'I'm a legacy hand model and just never knew it.'","Ashly Covington has been a full-time professional hand model for 14 years .
