"The Dallas hospital that treated America's Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan is offering its employees rooms so they can avoid exposing their family and friends  to the virus . Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has made rooms available to the healthcare workers that treated Mr Duncan, who was the first person to die from Ebola on U.S. soil. Employees choosing to stay at the hospital will be housed in rooms in a separate part of the establishment throughout their monitoring period. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has made rooms available to the healthcare workers that treated Mr Duncan, who was the first person to die from Ebola on U.S. soil . In a statement, hospital officials said the precaution is not a medical recommendation but is for employees' peace of mind. 'We want to remind potentially affected employees that they are not contagious unless and until they demonstrate any symptoms, yet we understand this is a frightening situation for them and their families,' they said. 'We will be coordinating this effort with the county monitors who are already regularly checking on their temperatures for any sign of infection. The hospital will contact directly those being monitored to make arrangements.' The hospital also asked that anyone who may be affected to be 'good citizens' and avoid using public transportation or engaging in any other activities that could put others at risk. Mr Duncan, 42, was diagnosed with the deadly disease at the end of September after returning from a trip to Liberia. He died from the virus on October 8. Mr Duncan, 42, was diagnosed with the deadly disease at the end of September after returning from a trip to Liberia. He died from the virus on October 8 . Since his death, two nurses who had cared for Mr Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian have been diagnosed with the disease. Nina Pham, 26, a Texas Christian University nursing school graduate, is in isolation being treated for the disease after being diagnosed at the weekend. Nurse Amber Joy Vinson, 29, was transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia on Wednesday. She is said to be 'ill but clinically stable'. The  hospital  has since apologized for the first time in their mismanaged handling of the outbreak. The Dallas hospital's Chief Clinical Officer Dr Daniel Varga admits they 'made mistakes' when Duncan first showed up at the hospital with Ebola symptoms. He was initially sent away with antibiotics, despite telling health care workers that he had recently arrived from Liberia - one of the three countries currently battling the largest outbreak of the disease in history. 'Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr. Duncan, despite our best intentions and a highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes. We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry,' Dr Varga says in a statement to Congress, released Wednesday. A Congressional committee had called Dr Varga to testify on Thursday, but he said he would not be able to make the meeting in person since he is busy dealing with the crisis at his hospital. While Dr Varga apologized for the initial misdiagnosis of Duncan, he says once the patient was brought back to the hospital he was 'treated with the most appropriate and available medical interventions'. When Duncan succumbed to the disease last week, the entire hospital grieved. Nurses Amber Jay Vinson, left, and Nina Pham, right, are both being treated for the deadly virus after becoming infected while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan, who died from the disease . 'It was devastating to the nurses, doctors, and team who tried so hard to save his life. We keep his family in our thoughts and prayers,' Dr Varga said. Included in the statement, is a section on 'lessons learned and steps taken' in the aftermath of Duncan's death, and the subsequent diagnosis of two nurses. Dr Varga writes that staff are now taking travel history from patients at 'first point of contact' in the emergency room. They are also taking a more 'proactive, intensive' approach to training staff on how to deal with Ebola. 'We are determined to be an agent for change across the US healthcare system by helping our peers benefit from our experience,' Dr Varga wrote.","Texas Health Presbyterian  has made rooms available to healthcare workers .

"Apple's much anticipated system that lets iPhone 6 owners pay simply by tapping their phone has been launched. Called Apple Pay, it can store  Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit card information. It works with the handset's touch ID fingerprint recognition system. Scroll down for video . The system was first announced on September 9th, and is expected to be made available to consumers this weekend. Apple Pay is compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and the Apple Watch. The mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. Apple Pay supports credit and debit cards from the three major payment networks, American Express, MasterCard and Visa, issued by the top US banks. In addition to American Express, Bank of America, Capital One Bank, Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo and others, who announced support in September, more than 500 new banks from across the country have signed on to Apple Pay, CEO Tim Cook revealed last week. 'Our team has worked incredibly hard to make Apple Pay private and secure, with the simplicity of a single touch of your finger,' said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. 'The reaction to Apple Pay has been amazing. We continue to add more Apple Pay ready banks, credit card companies and merchants, and think our users will love paying with Apple Pay.' 'We are excited to make it easier and more convenient for our customers to shop at Whole Foods Market,' said Walter Robb, co-CEO of Whole Foods Market. 'We are thrilled to be one of the first retailers to accept Apple Pay across all of our locations nationwide as it offers our shoppers a fast, private and secure check out option at our stores.' Apple Pay is designed to protect the user's personal information, the firm says. It doesn't collect any transaction information that can be tied back to a user and payment transactions are between the user, the merchant and the user's bank. Apple doesn't collect your purchase history, so when you are shopping in a store or restaurant we don't know what you bought, where you bought it or how much you paid for it. The service will be able to store Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit card information. Apple said shops like Macy's and Bloomingdales, drugstores including Walgreen's and Duane Reade, and other stores including McDonald's, Staples, Subway and Whole Foods are participating in Apple Pay. Actual card numbers are not stored on the device, instead, a unique Device Account Number is created, encrypted and stored in the Secure Element of the device. The Device Account Number in the Secure Element is walled off from iOS and not backed up to iCloud. Users can make purchases in stores and within apps, with credit cards issued by many of the leading banks nationwide, which make up 83 percent of the credit card purchase volume in the US.* . In addition to the 262 Apple retail stores in the US, availability from leading retailers at launch include: Aéropostale, American Eagle Outfitters, Babies'R'Us, BJ's Wholesale Club, Bloomingdale's, Champs Sports, Chevron and Texaco retail stores including ExtraMile, Disney Store, Duane Reade, Footaction, Foot Locker, House of Hoops by Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Macy's, McDonald's, Nike, Office Depot, Panera Bread, Petco, RadioShack, RUN by Foot Locker, SIX:02, Sports Authority, SUBWAY, Toys'R'Us, Unleashed by Petco, Walgreens, Wegmans and Whole Foods Market. In addition, many others will add support this year, such as Anthropologie, Free People, Sephora, Staples, Urban Outfitters, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts and more. The mobile system works by holding phone up to a generic card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. The NFC chip is fitted across the top of the phone. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. It uses the Passbook app and cards that are already on file with iTunes can be saved to it. Users can also take a picture of their own credit card and add it to the account. This is verified by the card's bank before being accepted. The cards are stores in the passbook app already used for boarding passes and tickets. Users can see their recent transactions in the app, and switch between cards easily. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. This won't cancel the cards, either, because the card details themselves are not stored on that device. Apple said it is 'working hard' on bringing it to the UK, although a date has yet to be announced. The Cupertinpo-based firm says it's easier and more secure than using a credit or debit card. To add a card, a user will take a picture of it with their iPhone and send it to an Apple data centre. There it will be verified it with their bank before it gets added to the user's Passbook.","Apple Pay enabled as part of free iOS 8 update .

"The hospital where Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan died strenuously defended his treatment on Thursday and said he was given the highest level of care 'regardless of nationality or ability to pay'. The Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas was responding to claims from the 42-year-old Liberian's family that he was given substandard treatment because he was 'a poor black man'. The hospital said Mr Duncan had been cared for by a team of over 50 doctors and nurses, 24 hours a day. Good treatment: Texas Health Presbyterian said Thomas Eric Duncan, above, had the best available care after his family claimed he was discriminated against because he was a 'poor black man' Discrimination: Josephus Weeks, pictured with Jesse Jackson, told MSNBC after his uncle passed away: 'He had a very deep accent coming from West Africa. I believe they [the hospital authorities] didn't believe he deserved the care that everyone else should get. And you don't treat people like that' It said Mr Duncan was not given the experimental drug ZMapp because the manufacturer hasn't got any more stocks and he was not given a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor because he was a different blood group. Details of his care were released as Duncan's nephew launched a renewed attack on the Dallas hospital, claiming his uncle had received inferior treatment. Josephus Weeks told MSNBC: 'He is a poor black man. He had a very deep accent coming from West Africa. I believe they [the hospital authorities] didn't believe he deserved the care that everyone else should get. And you don't treat people like that.' However the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has highlighted their determined effort to treat Mr Duncan and offered sympathy to his family and friends. It said: 'Mr. Duncan's physicians treated him with the most appropriate and available medical interventions, including the investigative antiviral drug Brincidofovir. 'After consulting with experts across the country, the CDC, and the FDA, the investigative drug was administered as soon as his physicians determined that his condition warranted it, and as soon as it could be obtained. Mr. Duncan was the first Ebola patient to receive this drug. Dr Rick Sacra (left) was treated at a Nebraska hospital and received a blood transfusion from survivor Kent Brantly. Sacra survived and now  Ashoka Mukpo (right) is in the same boat as doctors in Nebraska administer Brantly's blood to the NBC News cameraman . Recovered: Dr Kent Brantly (left) and hygienist missionary Nancy Writebol (right) were the first two Ebola infected people ever brought to the United States and both have made a full recovery after receiving the experimental drug ZMapp . 'The drug ZMapp was not administered to Mr Duncan because it was not available. According to the CDC and the drug manufacturer, it has not been available since August 12, 2014. 'Mr. Duncan did not receive the same type of serum transfusion as the patient in Nebraska because his blood type was not compatible with the serum donors. 'A team of more than 50 people cared for him in a professional and compassionate manner. An entire 24-bed intensive care unit was secured and dedicated to Mr. Duncan's care. The treatment area remains sealed and is being aggressively decontaminated.' The hospital also claimed Mr Duncan was appropriately dealt with when he first presented to the hospital feeling unwell with Ebola-like symptoms - and was sent home with antibiotics - two days before he was rushed to hospital and given the correct diagnosis. It said: 'In addition, we'd like to correct some misconceptions that have been reported about Mr. Duncan’s first visit. Our care team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and care that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care. 'In this case that included a four-hour evaluation and numerous tests. We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area.' Unfair: The hospital (officials of whom were pictured with Texas Governor Rick Perry last week, above) said: 'Our care team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and care that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care' Resources: The hospital said 'a team of more than 50 people cared for him in a professional and compassionate manner. An entire 24-bed intensive care unit was secured and dedicated to Mr. Duncan's care' Coming to America: Duncan, seen here with a female relative shortly after landing at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, traveled to the US to marry his longtime love Louise Troh . Josephus Weeks, Mr Duncan’s nephew, has the backing of human rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson. He maintains his uncle was discriminated against. Five US citizens have been diagnosed with Ebola and three have recovered. Virus victims Kent Brantley and Nancy Writebol were treated with the experimental drug ZMapp. Dr Rick Sacra and NBC camera Ashoka Mukpo received transfusions of Dr Brantley’s blood. Ashoka Mukpo, is being treated at the University of Nebraska’s Medical Centre and a World Health Organization doctor is being treated in Atlanta, Georgia. Mr Weeks told MSNBC: 'We were being mistreated. We were again being stigmatized. We go in there we being like, you know, ostracized. But after Reverend Jackson stepped in and he cried out for help for us, then a lot of people started changing their mindset.' Reverend Jackson has echoed Mr Weeks claims of discrimination. Rev Jackson told MSNBC: 'There's a fact of anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-black. It's very real in our country. All we really know is that there was one treatment for the Americans at Emory, one treatment for the American in Nebraska, one treatment for Eric in Dallas. 'We know that in those cases where there were symptoms they got immediate relief. He had the symptom, came to the hospital and was turned away. 'He came back and laid there for three days really on oxygen and drip in bed sleeping to death until we began to protest. And now they've begun to make moves to make amends. And that's a good thing. But it did take a cry out from the public.' Rev Jackson has been outspoken about Mr Duncan's treatment. He said in a tweet this morning: 'Thomas Eric Duncan deserved early and better treatment. We should learn from this tragedy. May he rest in peace.' However Pastor George Mason, of the Wilshire Baptist Church, where Mr Duncan’s fiance Louise Troh is among the congregation, says criticism of the hospital was a natural reaction to grief. He told MailOnline: 'There needs to be an investigation in the hospital procedures. But claims that Mr Duncan was not treated properly because he did not have medical insurance, because he was an immigrant, because he was black – these are all expressions of frustration and anger. Condemnation: Reverend Jesse Jackson, seen here with Duncan's mother, said: 'There's a fact of anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-black. It's very real in our country' Speaking out:  Louise Troh (left), Thomas Eric Duncan's  fiancée, issued a statement calling for a full review of Duncan's medical care . 'This is part of the normal train of events of people grieving for a loved-one – the ""what could have been, what should have been done"" questions are normal.' Louise Troh and other members of her family who had close contact with Mr Duncan remain in quarantine or have had their movements restricted as doctors monitor whether they contracted the potentially deadly virus. The family are in deep mourning following Mr Duncan's death. But plans for a memorial service for him must wait until the quarantine is lifted, Pastor Mason has said. The hospital also hailed Mr Duncan’s courageous struggle against the virus and said staff shared his family's heartache. It said: ‘Yesterday morning at 7:51 a.m. CT, Mr. Thomas Eric Duncan died after a courageous battle with Ebola. ‘Mr. Duncan’s family has experienced a personal and profound loss, and we share their grief. ‘Ebola is an insidious disease that attacks the body in multiple ways. Last Saturday, Oct. 4, Mr. Duncan’s condition changed from serious to critical and remained critical, as reported in our daily patient updates. ‘Wednesday morning, Oct. 8, his condition deteriorated. ‘In spite of the intensive care he was receiving, his heart stopped. ‘Early in his hospital stay, Mr. Duncan had expressed his wishes to his attending physician that the care team should not perform chest compressions, defibrillation or cardioversion to prolong his life.’ People hold candles during a a prayer vigil and memorial at Wilshire Baptist Church for Mr Duncan following his death from the Ebola virus. The church's pastor said the criticism of the hospital was a natural reaction to grief .

Scare: Sgt Michael Monnig, who visited the apartment where Mr Duncan was staying, was taken to hospital yesterday feeling unwell. Health officials said on Thursday that he does not have Ebola, despite his scare . Mr Duncan arrived in Texas on September 20 after allegedly lying on a form stating he had not come into contact with anyone with Ebola when he boarded a plane Liberia. He began showing symptoms of Ebola three days after his arrival and was admitted to Texas Presbyterian Hospital on September 28. Meanwhile, a Sheriff’s deputy who feared he had become infected with Ebola during a visit to the Dallas apartment where Mr Duncan was staying has been given the all clear.","Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said he had been cared for by a team of over 50 doctors and given the most 'appropriate and available' care .

"A college sorority has been shut down after an photo was circulated showing members dressed in an offensive parody of Mexicans. It showed the sisters of Chi Omega at Penn State wearing sombreros, ponchos and fake moustaches while holding up signs saying 'will mow lawn for weed + beer' and 'I don't cut grass I smoke it'. The picture - apparently taken around Halloween 2012 - came to light in December that year and sparked an immediate backlash from fellow students at the publicly funded university. Offensive: The picture that was circulated on . the Internet showing the sisters of Nu Gamma, Penn State's Chi Omega . chapter dressed according to a racist parody of Mexican culture, habits . and national dress . On Tuesday Chi Omega's national . organisation finally shut down its Penn State chapter, having placed it . on probation when the scandal broke 14 months ago. Sorority . officials said the governing council had worked with the local chapter . to keep it open but many members 'did not adhere to the mandated . requirements.' Chi Omega national president Letitia Fulkerson said the chapter was closed because 'concerns continue to persist.' The . organisation's National Headquarters released a statement saying that . members of its Penn State chapter, known as Nu Gamma, had 'participated . in activities that are not congruent with Chi Omega's values and . purposes.' 'Chi Omega . alumnae volunteers and Executive Headquarters staff members have worked . closely with the chapter members to provide the highest level of support . in order to move the chapter forward,' the statement said. 'However, many members did not adhere to the mandated requirements.' The photo, which quickly spread across the internet after it found its way onto Tumblr, caused considerable outrage with the school’s Latino community. Cesar Sanchez Lopez, vice president of Penn State's Mexican American Student Association, said at the time the scandal first broke that the stereotypes were offensive and ‘untrue.’ Other students tacked up posters on the door of Penn State’s Fraternity and Sorority Life offices with the photo captioned with ‘Racial insensitivity – brought to you by Chi Omega’ and ‘We are racist… Chi Omega.’ The U.S. is home to the second largest community of Mexicans in the world, after Mexico itself, with more than one in 10 citizens having full or partial Mexican ancestry. Speaking of the decision to shut down Nu Gamma, Meaghan DeMallie, president of Penn State's Panhellenic Association, told Pennlive.com that it was not directly because of the scandal, but also what happened after. 'I think there’s been a disconnect between what the national headquarters’ policies are and what the culture at Penn State is,' she said. 'I don’t think [the photo] is the direct reason, it’s more what’s happened since then, and they may not have grown as much as the national organization wanted.' Penn State: Meaghan DeMallie, president of the school's Panhellenic Association, said that the decision to shut down the Chi Omega chapter was not directly because of the scandal, but also what happened after . Ms Fulkerson told WJACTV.com: 'The decision to close a chapter is the most difficult decision to Governing Council faces. 'The national organization has worked closely with this chapter on both education and operational directives, particularly regarding risk management and bystander behavior. 'Unfortunately, these concerns continue to persist, and the Governing Council must close Nu Gamma Chapter for the safety of our members.' Chi Omega was founded in 1895 at the University of Arkansas. It is the largest women's fraternal organization in the world with over 320,000 members and 174 collegiate chapters.","Halloween picture sparked backlash after it emerged in December 2012 .

"This is the extraordinary grave of an ancient king credited with laying the foundations for the Mayan civilisation more than 2,000 years ago, which has been discovered by archaeologists in Guatemala. Researchers said they uncovered the grave of King K'utz Chman, a priest who is believed to have reigned around 700 B.C., at the Tak'alik Ab'aj dig in Retalhuleu, in the south-west of the country. Packed with jade jewels and other artefacts, it is the oldest royal Mayan burial ground ever found. Extraordinary artefacts: A jade figure (left) and jade beans (right) found in the royal tomb of the Mayan king . Unearthed: Pots in the grave of King K'utz Chman, a priest who is believed to have reigned around 700 B.C. Great treasures: Packed with artefacts, the grave is the most ancient royal Mayan burial ground found to date . ‘He was the big chief,’ government archaeologist Miguel Orrego said. ‘The ruler who bridged the gaps between Olmec (pre-Mayan) and Mayan cultures and initiated the slow transition to Mayan rule.’ Historians believe he was the first leader to introduce elements that would define Mayan culture, such as building pyramids instead of square structures and carving sculptures that profiled royal families. Guatemala is studded with ruins from the ancient Mayan civilisation, which thrived between A.D. 250 and 800 and extended from modern day Honduras to central Mexico. The Olmec Empire began to fade around 400 B.C. while Mayans grew in number and wrested control of trade routes. Inside the grave, the team found glistening jade jewels including a necklace with a pendant carved in the shape of a vulture's head, a symbol that represented power and high economic status and that was given to respected elder men. Amazing find: More pots found in the royal tomb of the Mayan king, located to the west of Guatemala City . Verification: Scientists found the grave in June, but it has taken until now to confirm it belonged to K'utz Chman . Past times: Ceramic dolls found in the royal tomb of the Mayan king discovered at the Tak'alik Ab'aj dig . ‘This symbol gives this burial greater importance,’ Mr Orrego said. ‘This glyph says he (is) one of the earliest rulers of Tak'alik Ab'aj.’ 'He was the big chief. The ruler who bridged the gaps between Olmec and Mayan cultures and initiated the slow transition to Mayan rule' Miguel Orrego, government archaeologist . Scientists found the grave in June, but it has taken until now for experts to verify it belonged to K'utz Chman. Although no human remains were found at the site, the carbon dated artefacts suggest that the king was buried between 770 to 510 B.C. ‘The richness of the artefacts tells us he was an important and powerful religious leader,’ archaeologist Christa Schieber said. ‘He was very likely the person who began to make the changes in the system and transition into the Mayan world.’ Jade beans: Guatemala is studded with amazing ruins from the Mayans, who thrived between A.D. 250 and 800 . Importance: The team found glistening jade jewels, including a necklace with a pendant carved in the shape of a vulture's head - a symbol that represented power and high economic status .

Susan Gillespie, an archaeologist at the University of Florida who was not involved in the excavation, spoke about the find. She said older tombs have been found from ruling circles at the Mayan site of Copan in Honduras as well as in southern Mexico, where the pre-Mayan Olmec culture flourished. Olmec influences are present in the area around Tak'alik Ab'aj, indicating possible links. She said that because it is near a jadeite production centre, the find could shed light on early techniques and trade in the stone, which was considered by the Maya to have sacred properties.","Amazing discovery at the Tak'alik Ab'aj dig in Retalhuleu, western Guatemala .

"A Chicago-based newspaper syndicate issued an apology to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) after being accused of publishing an anti-Semitic crossword clue. Tribune Media Services printed a clue asking for a three-letter word meaning Shakespeare's 'Shylock' from Merchant of Venice. The answer, 'Jew.' In response the ADL quickly issued a statement urging the paper to print an apology and refrain from writing future puzzle clues the perpetuate negative cultural stereotypes. Tribune Media Services issued an apology for printed a crossword clue in which the three-letter answer of 'Shylock' was 'Jew.' Seen here Al Pacino portrays Shakespeare's Shylock in the 2004 Merchant of Venice film . In a press statement issued shortly after the puzzle's publication, the ADL reprimanded the syndicate for 'perpetuat[ing] classic anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews as evil and money-hungry,' and asked they print an apology. In his letter Abraham H. Foxman, the National Director of the ADL wrote, 'Perhaps the puzzle authors were unaware of the use of Shakespeare’s Shylock character throughout the years as a vehicle for antisemitism.' He continued, 'Selecting Shylock to elicit the answer ‘Jew’ demonstrates cultural ignorance and an extreme lack of sensitivity. Even if done inadvertently, such a linkage perpetuates classic antisemitic stereotypes of Jews as evil and money-hungry.' Abraham H. Foxman, director of  the Anti-Defamation League, asked the newspaper to issue an apology for the crossword clue . In Shakespeare's play Shylock is a money lender, who when the character of Antonio defaults on his loan, demands a pound of flesh from him. The newspaper printed an apology for the clue, according to a report from The Jewish Press. The public apology, which was printed in the Sunday papers, came from managing editor Mary Elson. Elson wrote, 'The puzzle should not have been distributed with that clue, and we apologize for the offense it caused. The issue has been discussed with the creators and editors involved, and the clue will not be used again in a Tribune Media Services crossword,' according to a report by Arutz Sheva. In their complaint the ADL attested that Shylock (played her by Patrick Stewart), a Jewish money lender in The Merchant of Venice, has been used a negative Jewish stereotype for years . The Tribune added that it, 'is very sensitive to racial or cultural . references in the content we distribute and regret that this slipped . through,' The Jewish Press reported. Foxman responded in kind, commending the Tribune for their 'swift action in response.' 'They have made clear to us that they understood this was an offensive stereotype, and that the Shylock clue should never have made it into the puzzle,' Foxman said in a statement. The ADL also received an apology from the crossword editor of the Los Angeles Times, another national outlet that printed the crossword, the statement attests. The paper apologized for using 'Shylock,' portrayed here in 1989 by Dustin Hoffman, in the puzzle and any offense they caused . However, in an interview with Tablet Magazine, Barry Edelstein, Shakespearean expert and Artistic Director of the Old Globe Theater in San Diego, argued against the merits of the ADL's complaint on theatrical grounds. Edelstein, who is currently directing his third production of Merchant of Venice this summer, told Tablet, 'As a Jew and not any kind of an expert [on anti-Semitism], I think this is a case of the ADL and Foxman defining anti-Antisemitism down.' 'I just don’t agree that this crossword puzzle clue rises to the level of noxious anti-Antisemitism.' Edelstein cited moments from the play supporting the veracity of the crossword clue, including that at one point Shylock takes to center stage and speaks the line ‘I am a Jew.’ 'I just don’t find it offensive,' Edelstein said to the online magazine, 'in fact, I find it kind of innocuous. If the answer had been ‘bloodsucker’ then that’s a different case. But this seems to me, if you’ll pardon the Shakespeare line, ‘a tempest in a teapot.''","Tribune Media Services newspapers printed a crossword clue where the three-letter answer for Shakespeare's 'Shylock' was 'Jew'

"The incoming head of the CIA converted to Islam while working as a station chief in Saudi Arabia in the 1990s, a former FBI agent has claimed. John Guandolo, who retired from the FBI in 2008, said in a radio interview that John Brennan - who has been nominated by Barack Obama as the new director of the CIA - visited the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina accompanied by Saudi officials who may have persuaded him to convert. Mr Guandolo's tale echoes elements of the plot of hit show Homeland, in which U.S. Marine Nick Brody converts to Islam while being held prisoner by al-Qaeda, only to begin working for the CIA after his release. Scroll down for video . Accusations: John Brennan (right) has been nominated as the new Director of the CIA by President Barack Obama . Mr Guandolo told the Trento Radio Show via Skype that Mr Brennan visited the holy sites during the Hajj season - in sees hundreds of thousands of Muslims converge on the cities to perform a series of rituals - while serving as CIA station chief in Riyadh between 1996 and 1999, a report on Al Arabiya News said. Non-Muslims are prohibited from entering Mecca, and are not permitted to enter the city centre, or sacred core, of Medina. The ex-FBI agent told the radio station Mr Brennan was 'unfit' to take charge of the CIA, and claimed U.S. government officials based in Saudi Arabia during that period 'were direct witnesses to his growing relationships with individuals who work with the Saudi government and they witnessed his conversion to Islam'. Homeland: The hit show sees Marine-turned-terrorist Nick Brody begin working with the CIA . Converted: Brody, seen preparing to pray in an episode of Homeland, hid his new faith from his family upon his return to the U.S. Mr Brennan, 57, has spent more than three decades working in intelligence. He was nominated as the new head of the CIA on January 7 by President Obama, after predecessor General David Petraeus was forced to resign amid a scandal surrounding an affair with his biographer. In the critically-acclaimed series Homeland Lieutenant Nick Brody was 'turned' by his captors during an eight year stint as a prisoner of war. Upon his release he is welcomed back to the U.S. as a war hero and soon attracts the interest of high-level politicians who encourage him to run for Congress. But the newly devout Muslim is secretly working for terrorist Abu Nazir. The second season of Homeland sees Brody forced to begin covertly helping the CIA in its hunt for Nazir after his cover is blown by agent Carrie Mathison.

'It means a lot. This has been a huge effort by all of you,' he adds, before tearing up. Ms Pham then smiles and tells her doctor not to cry. 'We're really proud of you,' Dr Weinstein says. That causes Ms Pham to start crying herself, and another physician standing by in full hazmat suiting hands her a tissue to wipe away her tears. The camera does not linger on Ms Pham long enough to see where she disposes of the wet tissue after drying her eyes. 'I love you guys,' she says. 'We love you, Nina,' Dr Weinstein responds, at the end of the video. Ms Pham was discharged from the Dallas hospital Thursday evening to fanfare as her coworkers gathered outside the building to see her off, holding up signs like 'Get well' and 'You're a rock star'. She landed in Bethesda around 10:40pm Eastern Time, and was admitted to NIH hospital shortly before midnight. Goodbyes: The video was recorded just before Ms Pham left the Dallas hospital Thursday.

Watering eyes: Another health care worker in the room is seen handing Ms Pham a tissue to wipe away her tears . Ms Pham was discharged from Texas Health Thursday evening . This afternoon Ms Pham asked the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to release a statement on her behalf thanking her family, friends and co-workers for the outpouring of support. ‘I feel very blessed, and have gained strength from their support. I appreciate everything that my coworkers [sic] have done to care for me at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas,’ the nurse stated. ‘I’m doing really well thanks to this team, which is the best in the world. I believe in my talented coworkers. I am #presbyproud!’ The press release from the beleaguered hospital also included a statement from Dr. Gary Weinstein, chief of pulmonology and critical care medicine, who described the decision to transfer Ms Pham to Maryland as a difficult one. ‘We’re so glad she has improved so much in such a short amount of time,’ he said. ‘Our prayers are with her, and she’ll be in wonderful hands at NIH.’ Hospital spokeswoman Candace White concluded the statement by saying that it is in the best interest of everyone involved to ‘give the hospital an opportunity to prepare for whatever comes next.’ Meanwhile, the City of Dallas released new photos of Ms Pham's beloved Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Bentley, looking cheerful during quarantine at the Dallas Animal Services and Adoption Center.

On Wednesday, Presbyterian Hospital was treating two Ebola patients - Ms Pham and nurse Amber Vinson, both employees of the hospital who contracted the disease while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan. By tonight, the hospital will have zero Ebola patients in its care after federal officials ordered both of them moved to specialized facilities. Ms Vinson was flown out of Dallas to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta Wednesday night. There are four hospitals with infectious disease isolation wards in the United States. Three of them are currently treating patients . Furry friend: Ebola patient Nina Pham's pooch Bentley looks cheerful during quarantine in this photo released Thursday by City of Dallas. The sick nurse's beloved Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is being cared for by professionals wearing protective hazmat suits . There are four special infectious disease hospitals in the US - one in Maryland, one in Atlanta, one in Nebraska and one in Montana . Nurses have come forward to allege that training and procedures at the hospital were not adequate to protect them. Medical records obtained by the Associated Press revealed that during Duncan's first two days in the hospital, nurses did not wear protective hazmat gear when treating him. Nurses also complained that their necks and wrists were exposed in the suits that they were given, that some supervisors said face masks weren't necessary and that Duncan was not isolated for hours before he was admitted to the hospital. All these claims follow the shocking news weeks ago that Duncan was sent home with a prescription for antibiotics when he first showed up at the hospital - despite telling nurses he had traveled from West Africa. There are currently four Americans being treated for Ebola in the United States. NBC News freelancer Ashoka Mukpo is being treated at University of Nebraska Medical Center in Lincoln. Ms Vinson is at Emory University Hospital, along with an American World Health Organization doctor who contracted the disease while working in Sierre Leone. The only US hospital with an infectious disease isolation unit that has thus far not treated an Ebola patient is St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula, Montana. This comes as President Obama said on Thursday he is considering appointing an Ebola 'czar' as the lead U.S. coordinator in the effort to contain the virus and that he remains opposed to a ban on travel from West Africa. Workers put on full hazmat gear to clean up the apartment of Amber Vinson, the second sick nurse, on Thursday . The National Institutes of Health Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, is one of four hospitals in the nation that has a special infectious disease isolation ward . Obama met in the Oval Office with aides who are involved in the Ebola fight and spoke to reporters afterward. He said 'it may be appropriate' at some stage to put one person in charge of the effort. Some lawmakers, such as Republican Senator John McCain, have been urging him to take this step. Amber Vinson, 29, is feared to have been exhibiting Ebola symptoms as early as Friday before she took her flight out of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport to Cleveland, Ohio . Gesturing to top aides who are leading various aspects of the Ebola fight like Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, national security adviser Susan Rice and Centers for Disease Control director Tom Frieden, Obama said they have many other duties in addition to Ebola. 'It's not that they haven't been doing an outstanding job working hard on this issue, but they're also responsible for a whole lot of other stuff,' he said. Obama resisted pressure from lawmakers to impose a ban on travel from West Africa. He said experts tell him that 'a flat-out travel ban is not the way to go' because a ban would be less effective than current screening measures on travelers to the United States from the region. 'I don't have a philosophical objection necessarily to a travel ban if that is the thing that is going to keep the American people safe,' he said. But he noted that some travelers might attempt to enter the United States under the radar and would avoid the screening measures, leading possibly to more rather than fewer Ebola cases. Indeed, the president's comments came after the news that Ebola-stricken nurse Amber Vinson may have been showing symptoms of the deadly virus as early as last Friday - before she flew to Ohio for the weekend and then back to Texas. The CDC made the shocking announcement on Thursday, after Miss Vinson was revealed as the second medical worker in Dallas to contract Ebola from the U.S.'s 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan. Ebola update: President Barack Obama spoke about the government's response to Ebola from the Oval Office of the White House on Thursday . On October 10, Miss Vinson, 29, may have had Ebola symptoms when she flew out of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport on Frontier Airlines Flight 1142 to Cleveland to plan her upcoming wedding, a health official said today. CDC Dr Chris Braden said during a press briefing on Thursday: 'We had started to look at the possibility that she had symptoms going back as far as Saturday. 'This has to do with the bridal shop. Some more information that has come through recently says we can't rule out that she might have had the start of her symptoms on Friday.' Seven people in Cleveland and Akron have put themselves in voluntary quarantine after coming into contact with Miss Vinson, including five friends whom she shopped with for bridesmaid dresses at bridal store, Coming Attractions, in Cleveland. The news has prompted high schools and medical centers in Ohio to send home staff and students amid fears that they could have come into contact with the nurse. Miss Vinson remained in her home for the three days she was in Cleveland, except for one trip to a bridal store with friends - but authorities are pressing her further on her movements. The store's owners have voluntarily closed while CDC officials investigate the level of risk. The owner of the store told Newsnet5 that Miss Vinson didn't seem sick when she visited to pick out dresses. The 29-year-old is now being treated at Emory in Atlanta, Georgia where she was described as being in a stable condition.","Video shows Nina Pham saying goodbye to her doctor before she was transferred to a hospital in Maryland, Thursday evening .

"A person who witnessed Georgina Bartter's collapse at a dance festival was disgusted that at least five bystanders were videoing the 19-year-old as paramedics tried to save her life. Georgina Bartter, 19, was at Harbourlife festival at Mrs Macquarie's Chair near the Sydney Botanical Gardens on Saturday when she lost consciousness on the dancefloor. She died on Saturday night at St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst from multiple organ failure. Friends told police that she took just one and a half pills, believed to be MDMA. The teenager was the oldest of three children and believed to be studying accounting. She finished Year 12 in 2013 at Wenona, a private girls' high school in North Sydney. A witness has told Daily Mail Australia of his distress when he realised strangers were filming Ms Bartter after she collapsed on the dance floor. Scroll down for video . Georgina Bartter, 19, died of a suspected drug overdose at Harbourlife festival in Sydney on Saturday . 'I was five metres away from her when she collapsed. She was in the middle of the crowd and people had their phones up, pointed at her while medics worked on her,' he said. 'It was just sick. I saw about five guys filming. You can tell the difference between somebody texting and somebody videoing.' The witness says Ms Bartter was on the ground and unresponsive while at least five men nearby filmed her. 'One of my friends grabbed the phone out of someone's hands and yelled, ""what are you doing?""' 'You wouldn't think people can be so low.' Ms Bartter's close friends have detailed the distressing events that lead to her suspected overdose. A close friend, who spent most of the day before and during the festival with the 19-year-old, told Daily Mail Australia that he first noticed something was wrong when she started shivering uncontrollably at around 4pm. 'She seemed fine for a while and then she started shivering as if she was getting cold', the friend revealed. 'She started going downhill from there.' Friends said the teenager had taken one and a half pills before she collapsed . Despite friends giving her water and trying to warm her up, Ms Bartter continued to deteriorate. 'I was with her for a while, just me and her, and I was there trying to give her a hug and keep her warm', the friend said. As she got worse another friend and his girlfriend were caring for the teenager from Longueville in Sydney's lower north shore before she started convulsing around 4.40pm. The same pair then travelled in an ambulance to hospital with Ms Bartter, where she died later that night. 'It's been pretty tough for all of us,' the friend said, describing Ms Bartter as a 'bubbly' and 'friendly' girl. Family have released a statement about the teenager's death, pictured here with her mother and grandmother . Another man was introduced to Ms Bartter at around 4pm by a mutual friend, and said the 19-year-old was shaking very badly. 'I shook her hand ... Her hand was shaking really really bad, but she was smiling, she said ""Hi I'm Georgina"",' he told Daily Mail Australia. He said although she seemed unwell he noticed no signs that she was about to collapse. 'If I had of looked at her and she'd been uneasy on her feet or looked like she was swaying we would have helped her ... If we had seen any sign that she was about to collapse we would have done something.' 'It's an absolute tragedy', he added. On Monday, a service was held in the 19-year-old's memory at Wenona, the high school Ms Bartter attended until her graduation in 2013. It's understood Georgina Bartter's younger sister currently attends the private girl's school. 'We have had a beautiful service for Georgina today with our Senior College students, and our younger girls have met with staff and counsellors,' said Dr Briony Scott, the school's principal. 'As parents and teachers, we will continue to walk alongside our young people, focusing onhope, and helping them come to terms with this loss.' Dr Scott says the school community is 'terribly sad' by the death of 'this gorgeous, funny, bright young woman' 'She will be remembered for her scholarship and for her active and friendly approach to life. She had an infectious sense of humour and we will miss her enormously.' 'I thank our community for their kind words and offers of help, which we have passed on to the Bartter family.' 'Our hearts and our prayers go out to them at this time.' The head of St Vincent's Hospital's Emergency department, Dr Gordion Fulde told Triple M that everything was done to save the economics student, who was in a critical condition when she arrived at the hospital. 'Ultimate tragedy, a teenage girl dies,' said Dr Fulde. 'As she was critical, within minutes, the intensive care consultant and team were mobilised and rushed down.' 'It was quickly evident the only chance of survival was to put her on a heart lung machine. This equipment mechanically gives her blood flow and oxygen,' said Dr Fulde. Operating equipment was moved down to the emergency ward as Ms Bartter's condiiton was quickly deteriorating. 'The cardiothoracic surgeon and operation theatre staff and the hi-tech machine were brought.' 'Despite care only available in a few hospitals worldwide a lovely girl died.' Witnesses recall seeing the young woman collapse, dropping to the ground in the middle of the dancefloor where she shook uncontrollably . Dr Fulde says the team at St Vincent's Hospital remain devastated after witnessing the family's intense grief. 'The grief and devastation of the family, of the mother was indescribable.' The family of the teenager released a statement on Sunday remembering her as a 'beautiful young woman'. The statement also remembered her as 'vibrant' and said the teenager's behaviour was out of character, Nine News reported. 'She was a beautiful and vibrant young woman, who was much loved and will be sadly missed, the statement read. 'She had allergies, and it was extremely out of character.' The family reportedly said, 'Georgina was allergic to drugs and never would have knowingly taken them', according to Channel Seven. An autopsy will be carried out to determine what was in the pill that contributed to her death. Officers were alerted to the unconscious 19-year-old woman as they carried out a drug operation at the event. Witnesses recall seeing Ms Bartter 'collapse' in the middle of the dance floor and begin frothing at the mouth. 'She was dancing next to us when she collapsed on the dance floor. I thought she was pretty hammered but then she just dropped to the floor,' one witness told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was shocking, you just don’t know what to do. We were all waving our arms around for a paramedic.' Friends described Ms Bartter, seen here with her father, as a 'bubbly' and 'friendly' young girl . The three witnesses were distressed to learn that the young woman had died, but say that night they knew something was drastically wrong. 'Medics were trying to resuscitate her and she was frothing at the mouth,' the witnesses, who wished not to be named, explained. 'When she got carried out she wasn't well. Her eyes were in the back of her head and her friends were freaking out.' Two of the witnesses explain that it was 'wild' and claim they saw four people taken to hospital due to what they assume were drug-related incidents. 'She was the worst but we saw three other people taken out by ambulances.' 'I actually wondered this morning if anyone had died cos I saw that many people overdose and in a bit of a state. It was that wild.' NSW Ambulance service confirm that four people were treated from Mrs Macquarie's Chair. Two people were taken to hospital by ambulance, including Ms Bartter. The second case was an alleged assault. Two suspected drug-related cases were treated at the scene. Ms Bartter, pictured with her mother and father died in hospital on Saturday night . Another witness recalls seeing the girl become ‘drowsy’ and ‘shaking’ before she collapsed. ‘Not long after she collapsed the medics were with her. She was shaking non-stop for a bit while on the ground. Very sad sight. Condolences to her family.’ Officers, meanwhile, arrested 78 people at the event for drug offences. Inspector Stewart Leggat of City Central Local Area Command asked for anyone with knowledge about synthetic substance sellers to come forward. 'The information you provide could save someone's life.' Insp Leggat warned about the dangers of taking illegal drugs, emphasising there was no quality control in their production. 'Quite simply, you don't know what you are getting - seeking a synthetic high, could result in a serious injury or death,' he said. 'If you know of a business or person who may be involved in the sale of illegal synthetic substances, please contact Crime Stoppers immediately. We don't need to know who you are, all we need is the information you have. Witnesses said they saw at least four people taken to hospital one the same day, from suspected drug-related incidents . 'The information you provide could save someone's life.' The organisers of Harbourlife, Fuzzy Events, have extended their sincere condolences to the young woman's loved ones and assure the public patron safety is a priority. 'Right now our thoughts are with her family – we can hardly imagine the pain and heartbreak they must be feeling, and they have our deepest sympathy,' the statement read. 'Harbourlife has been held annually since 2003. It has a fully equipped first aid tent with an emergency doctor, 2 paramedics, 3 first responder medics, 2 supervisors and a communications officer.' The 19-year-old was treated by paramedics at the scene and transported to St Vincents hospital, Darlinghurst where she died .","Georgina Bartter, 19, died from a suspected drug overdose at the weekend .

"Rihanna is just 'a heartbeat away from tragedy' because of a delusional stalker who may end up killing her if released, a New York City judge said Friday. Judge Orlando Marrazzo compared stalker Kevin McGlynn to the man who murdered John Lennon as he denied the homeless man's release from a psychiatric hospital. McGlynn, 54, was arrested last  July after hand-delivering letters to the pop star's Manhattan apartment in which he calls her a 'b****' and threatens to 'bum rush' and  gang rape her. He also believes he was in a relationship with Rihanna and that she stole his music. Scroll down for video . History repeating? A judge on Friday compared Rihanna's stalker to the man who shot dead John Lennon in 1980.

John Lennon was shot dead outside his apartment building on the Upper West Side. The scene outside the Dakota building in the wake of the December 8, 1980 shooting . Judge Marrazzo says McGlynn 'appears to be a ticking time bomb who is wholly fixated on (Rihanna), and poses a direct threat of serious physical harm or death to her and anyone around her.' 'It is entirely foreseeable that if he were free to continue to act upon his psychotic delusions without this court's intervention, it may result in the death of (Rihanna) or other innocent persons,' Marrazzo warned. He went on to call McGlynn 'severely psychotic and delusional' comparing him to Mark David Chapman, the man who shot John Lennon outside the Dakota apartment building in New York, after asking for the Beatle's autograph. After he was arrested 'lurking' around Rihanna's apartment four months ago, McGlynn was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Staten Island, but later transferred to the South Beach Psychiatric Center. In September, he was found unfit to stand trail on the stalking charges. McGlynn will continue to be held at the facility as the 'least restrictive' means to treat his mental illness. John Lennon's shooter Mark David Chapman remains imprisoned.

"This is the heart-stopping moment a driver narrowly avoided a head-on collision with a car travelling in the wrong direction on a dual carriageway. Police have confirmed a 73-year-old man, from Burgess Hill in West Sussex, drove the silver BMW in the wrong direction for almost eight miles - but it appears no one was hurt. The pensioner is now being assessed by health workers and the DVLA have been informed about the incident. Scroll down for video . This picture shows how close the two cars came to colliding as the silver BMW travels in the wrong direction . Sussex Police have confirmed the pensioner got on the dual carriageway shortly before 10am this morning after going in the wrong direction down a slip road at Hickstead. A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'He then drove  along lane three of the northbound carriageway. 'Vehicles heading north had to take evasive action to avoid him. 'We are investigating a report that a silver van collided with a telegraph pole as the driver swerved to avoid the BMW. There are no reports of any injuries.' The moment the silver BMW first becomes visible travelling in the wrong in the video shot from a dashboard camera . This picture shows exactly how close the two cars came to colliding - the silver BMW is on the right . Road policing unit officers intercepted the BMW on the A23 to the north of the Mill Road roundabout in Brighton. The spokesman added the driver stopped his car after seeing the marked police car travelling towards him slowly at the head of the traffic. The driver was then taken by ambulance to be assessed by health workers. Paul Germaine, 60, the managing director of a security firm, was travelling to work  when his dashboard camera filmed his narrow escape at around 10.13am this morning. He said: 'I drive a powerful car but I am so glad I was only doing the regulation 70 miles per hour at the time - it could have been nasty. 'At first I thought there had been an accident and the car was stationary and pointing in the wrong direction. 'But then I realised it was actually pottering along at around 30 or 40mph. Luckily, there was a space between the two vans I was overtaking and I managed to slide between the two. 'I immediately called 999 from the handsfree and the operator said they had already had several calls and had dispatched cars who were trying to catch up with him.' Concerned motorists took to social media to talk about the incident - Sussex Police said they received a number of calls . Sergeant Mark Baker from Sussex Police said: 'We are very grateful to all of the drivers and members of the public who stopped and called us to warn us about the man's driving and for their attentive driving that enabled them to avoid a collision. 'We were able to react quickly and thankfully no one was injured. 'The man is now being medically assessed and we will be making the DVLA aware of the incident.'","Pensioner, 73, in silver BMW travelled for eight miles in the wrong direction .

"Google and Microsoft will introduce a 'kill switch' to their mobile phones, joining Samsung and Apple - which has an 'Activation Lock' feature (pictured) Google and Microsoft will soon be introducing a ‘kill switch’ to their respective mobile software, so owners can deactivate their handsets if they're stolen. The move comes after a report by the New . York State attorney general found that the theft of iPhones has fallen . significantly in the six months since Apple introduced the security . features to its mobile operating system. A kill switch gives users the power to completely disable a smartphone remotely after it has been stolen. It also increases security on the phone by adding more password layers, to make it more difficult to wipe and then be sold on by thieves. According to the report, since the Activation Lock feature was added to Apple’s iOS 7 last year, the number of iPhone related robberies has fallen by 24 per cent in London, 17 per cent in New York and 39 per cent in San Francisco. The figures came from Apple statistics and crime rates supplied by local law enforcement. London figures were supplied as part of the Secure Our Smartphones (SOS) initiative. The feature requires the entry of a passcode in order to disable location services on the device. Earlier this year, Samsung introduced a similar feature called Reactivation Lock to some of its Galaxy smartphones, which allows users to lock their phone remotely should it go missing, or be stolen. The report confirmed that following the launch of SOS, supported by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, Microsoft and Google will be improving the security on their mobile devices. According to the report, since the Activation Lock feature was added to Apple's iOS 7 last year, the number of iPhone related robberies has fallen by 24 per cent in London, 17 per cent in New York and 38 per cent in San Francisco (pictured) However, thefts of Samsung devices increased . Beware! The tech giants' move to introduce a kill switch comes after a report by the New York State attorney general found thefts of iPhones in New York and London (pictured) have fallen significantly in the six months since Apple introduced the feature . Versions of the emergency feature are included on iPhone and Samsung handsets. A 'soft' kill switch, such as those currently offered, allow a person to block a thief from accessing their phone. This lets them disable their handset, add extra layers of security, and protect their personal data on it. Microsoft and Google will both add the feature to their next software update. While the feature will be welcomed by many, some experts think the only true way to stop data being exploited on stolen mobiles, or the handsets being sold on, is to damage them permanently. This is because the current services rely on a signal to be activated, which can be blocked if a thief turns off a phone or puts it in airplane mode straight away. A 'hard' kill switch would render a handset completely useless and the police are in favour of such a move, to stop the trade-in of stolen handsets. It said: 'With the release of this report, the SOS Initiative achieves two major milestones: Microsoft confirms it will incorporate a killswitch-type theft-deterrence solution in the next release of its Windows Phone operating system, which will run on all Nokia smartphones. And, Google confirms it will incorporate a killswitch-type theft-deterrence solution in its next version of the Android operating system, the most popular mobile operating system worldwide.’ Fred Humphries, Microsoft’s vice president of U.S. Government Affairs explained in a blog post: ‘Over recent months, Microsoft has been working with others in the wireless industry to develop voluntary principles for implementing more robust theft-deterrent technologies in smartphones. ‘The new theft deterrent features will be . offered as an update for all phones running Windows Phone 8.0 and . newer, though availability is subject to mobile operator and phone . manufacturer approval. Coming soon: Google has promised to include a kill switch feature in the next version of its Android operating system (pictured left on a Nexus 5 handset), while Microsoft has also said that theft deterrent features will be offered as an update for phones running Windows Phone 8.0, shown on this Nokia Lumia 920 (right) ‘Additional details on functionality and availability will be provided closer to the official release. With these additional features, we’re hopeful that technology - as part of a broader strategy - can help to further reduce incentives for criminals to steal smartphones in the first place.' Experts still want firmer kill switches to be introduced that permanently disable smartphones. Those used at the moment by Apple and Samsung rely on a signal being sent to the phone to lock it, or a password to keep out unwanted users. But experts have warned that turning a phone off or placing it in airline mode can block signal from reaching it. According to the most recent report into smartphone theft in the UK, more than 80,000 devices are stolen each year, compared to three million in the U.S. In the first five months of 2014, robberies and grand larcenies of iPhones dropped by 19 percent and 29 percent, compared to the same time period in the previous year (pictured in grey) while theft of Samsung handsets soared  by over 40 percent compared to the first five months of 2013 (shown in orange) The report by the New . York State Attorney General's Office, found that in London, mobile phone thefts doubled in number between 2010 and 2013, increasing from 16,141 to 32,872 respectively. Nearly half of London robberies involved a smartphone. In San Francisco, almost 60 per cent of 4,000 robberies involved a mobile . phone last year. Of these, seven out of ten were iPhones. Last year in New York, a quarter of . all thefts and over half of grand larcenies - property valued at over . $25 or $60 depending on the state - involved a smartphone. In the first five months of 2014 - after Apple introduced the Activation Lock - robberies and grand lanceries dropped by 19 and 29 per cent, compared to the same time period in 2013. But interestingly, robberies and grand larcenies of Samsung handsets increased by over 40 per cent compared to the first five months of 2013. Emails (pictured) include maps of the location of stolen devices as well as 'thefties' if the stolen phone is an Android . A San Francisco-based security firm has created a product that will email victims of smartphone theft a photo of the person who has snatched their phone. The photo, known as a ‘theftie’ will also be accompanied by a map of the device’s location, which could be useful if a thief has dumped a valuable device. The stolen phone’s camera will be triggered when a thief enters a wrong password, turns the device off or takes out the SIM card - accidentally taking a selfie, which is emailed to the phone's registered owner. Lookout, the company behind the idea, added the new 'Theft Alert' to its premium service, which is designed to be used on iPhones and Android handsets. ‘We are not providing this information for you to go out and find the device yourself,’ Lookout’s product manager Greg Lou said. ‘It is so you can give it to the police so they can find it for you.’ The premium version of Lookout costs $3 a month or $30 for the year and includes features such as backing up data, virus protection and finding lost phones. It is available on Android for £1.99 per month or £19.99 annually and iOS for £1.99 per month or £20.99 annually in the UK. The new capability will let users tell smartphones to send theft alerts if anyone botches a password or puts the device in 'airplane' mode to block network connections. On Android phones, such alerts will instruct front-facing cameras to take photos in the hope of capturing images of culprits. Emails that include maps of the location of stolen devices are sent to owners. In the case of Android, the emails include copies of ‘thefties’ taken with front-facing cameras.","Kill switches let phone owners deactivate their handsets if they are stolen .

"Ebola is now 'the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation', David Cameron said today. The Prime Minister warned other countries to 'look to their responsibilities' to help tackle the epidemic ravaging parts of West Africa amid growing anger at the lack of international support in the fight against the deadly virus. It came after the International Development Secretary Justine Greening warned that other countries needed to 'wake up' to the threat of Ebola and start helping to combat it. Scroll down for video . David Cameron hit out at countries other than Britain, France and the US over the efforts to tackle the Ebola crisis . Mr Cameron said Britain was 'leading the way' in providing assistance to the region and called for other countries to match the UK effort. The Royal Navy medical ship RFA Argus, which has a fully-equipped 100-bed hospital on board, set sail from Cornwall to Sierra Leone to join the humanitarian effort and is due to reach the area by the end of the month . But its facilities will not be used to treat Ebola patients themselves but will be there in case any of the UK military and civilian personnel working in the region become ill or are injured during the course of the operation. Britain has taken on responsibility for fighting the outbreak in Sierra Leone, while the US are leading in Liberia. The French government has agreed to take on the lead role combating the disease in its former colony of Guinea. But the Prime Minister said United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon had been right to call for other countries to deliver more in the way of funding and resources. 'This is the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation. It is very likely to affect a number of the countries here today,' Mr Cameron said as he arrived for the 50-plus nation Asia Europe Meeting in Milan, Italy. 'The action we are taking in Sierra Leone where we are committing well over £100 million, 750 troops, training 800 members of health staff, providing 700 beds - we are doing a huge amount. 'I think it is time for other countries to look at their responsibilities and their resources and act in a similar way to what Britain is doing in Sierra Leone, America is doing in Liberia, France is doing in Guinea. Other countries now need to step forward with resources and action because taking action at source in West Africa is the best way to protect all of us here in Europe.' The RFA Argus left Britain for the West Coast of Africa today as the Government ramped up its efforts to combat the outbreak of the disease . Royal Fleet Auxillary crew and members of the Royal Marines paraded on the deck of RFA Argus as it leaves Falmouth Docks today . Service personal stood to attention on the deck Royal Fleet Auxiliary Argus as it left the Cornwall harbour today on its way to Sierra Leone for a six month deployment to help combat the outbreak of Ebola . The public turned out to see off the RFA Argus, which will act as a 'floating hospital' off the coast of Sierra Leone . The Government's demand for greater international support came after after Mr Ban, the UN Secretary General, said last night that a 'huge and urgent global response' was needed to deal with the crisis and that countries which have 'the capacity' should provide funding now. 'This is quite serious. We need an urgent global response and support,' he said. While some £12.4 million has been pledged to a trust fund set up by Mr Ban, only 100,000 dollars has so far been received. Mr Ban's predecessor as secretary general Kofi Annan said he was 'bitterly disappointed' at the scale and speed of the international community's response to the crisis. 'If the crisis had hit some other region it probably would have been handled very differently,' Mr Annan told BBC2's Newsnight. 'In fact when you look at the evolution of the crisis, the international community really woke up when the disease got to America and Europe. 'I point the finger of blame at the governments with capacity ... I think there's enough blame to go around.' Britain and the United States are the biggest international contributors to the fight against Ebola . International Development Secretary Justine Greening said more needed to be done to fight the Ebola outbreak . Development Secretary Ms Greening  backed Mr Ban's remarks. She said: 'For countries that aren't playing a leading role we need them to start providing resources.' 'Of course Ban Ki-moon is quite right to say we need the rest of the international community to now provide support, channelled through the US trust fund that's been set up. 'The appeal is there in support of governments like the UK and the US…it's in support of enabling those strategies to be able to be scaled up.' Ms Greening backed UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's call for other countries to do more. She said: 'He is right to say that many more countries need to get involved. It is simply not going to be a tenable approach to simply leave the UK to work with Sierra Leone, to leave the US to work with Liberia, France to work with Guinea and no other countries get involved. 'Now I think it's fair to say that actually there is now movement, Germany is starting to provide funding. 'The international community now needs to wake up to this crisis, and start putting resources into working with the UK, and the US, in particular, to help deliver our strategy which we believe will be successful.' International health workers are trying to combat the Ebola outbreak in the high risk Paynesville suburb east of Monrovia, Liberia . The US has taken responsibility for tackling the disease in Liberia, with Britain taking the lead in Sierra Leone and France in Guinea . Britain and the US have so far contributed the bulk of the cash for the fight to contain the outbreak, jointly providing almost £600million . Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg had contributed more money to the fight against Ebola than India – while Microsoft founder Bill Gates had stumped up half as much as the French government. Ms Greening said the UK was as 'well-prepared as any country' in preventing the spread of Ebola reaching Europe. 'We have very robust systems in place, we had a training exercise with the NHS over last weekend to put those plans into action and test them. 'People should be clear that the risk to the UK remains low, but we are prepared and we're as well prepared as any country. We've introduced screening at our airports, we're the only European country to have done that so far.' She said the best thing the Government could do to minimise the risk to Britain was to work with the government of Sierra Leone to 'tackle Ebola over there in first place'. The ship is fitted with enough medical equipment to act as a floating hospital as good as any NHS institution . Ms Greening said: 'We've got a large programme now that is underway...it includes building treatment beds, and some of the military personnel heading out on RAF Argus will be helping us deliver those. That will provide treatment, not just for Ebola patients, but for healthcare workers. And if they get infected, we will now have much better capability in helping them recover.' She said Britain would be building 700 treatment beds which would triple the number of beds that Sierra Leone currently has. A naval ship with a 100-bed medical complex and loaded with helicopters, landing craft, tonnes of emergency supplies and almost 400 personnel left the UK today to head for Sierra Leone. Royal Fleet Auxiliary Argus, a vast hospital and support vessel, set sail from Falmouth in Cornwall to west Africa and act as a forward base for army medics, engineers, soldiers and aid experts who will build and operate medical centres, train local doctors and nurses and transport vital supplies. By the end of next month 750 British troops will be operating in Sierra Leone. With troops continuing to withdraw from Afghanistan it will be the largest overseas deployment of UK forces anywhere in the world. During a visit to the 28,000-tonne RFA Argus the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, described the ship, which first saw action during the Falklands conflict, as a 'warhorse' embarking on a vital humanitarian mission.","Countries other than UK and US need to 'start providing resources' for fight .

"The mother of a cannibal killer who murdered a woman by trying to eat her said today his victim could have been saved because her paranoid schizophrenic son 'should have been in hospital'. Matthew Williams, 34, who murdered Cerys Marie Yemm, 22, in a  hostel two weeks after leaving jail, called himself 'The Wolf' and told inmates: 'I'm a cannibal and eat people', it has emerged. A fellow prisoner who knew Williams while he served five years for attacking his girlfriend said he bragged about having eaten someone else but had 'put it down to talk until I heard what he'd done'. Williams had taken a cocktail of mind-bending drugs and told friends he was hearing voices and hallucinating before attacking Miss Yemm and biting off parts of her face and eating an eyeball. He collapsed and died at the scene shortly after police shot him with a 50,000-volt Taser and arrested him. His mother Sally Ann told the BBC her son, suffered paranoid schizophrenia and should not have been freed. Murder: Cerys Yemm (left) was killed by cannibal killer Matthew Williams (right), who was a paranoid schizophrenic who should have been in hospital, his mother said today . She says her son had been receiving medication for his mental illness in prison but, even though she demanded it continued when he was released, he did not receive any prescription. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We do not comment on individuals'. An inmate who knew Williams in prison has said that he called himself 'The Wolf' and would add: 'Because I am a cannibal and I eat people'. According to The Sun the 34-year-old was addicted to a Heroin substitute, and had also bragged to other prisoners thatThe Government is to examine whether 34-year-old Williams was properly managed following his release from prison and did not have proper access to medication. 'He would see things that were not there, he would hear voices, say food was trying to poison him and he would hallucinate. He was aggressive to people he thought were a threat to him,' his mother said. 'He should have been in hospital. Every time he came out of prison, we'd go through the same process. He'd be placed in a hostel somewhere with very little supervision and no psychiatric help outside.' She added the last time she saw him was the day before the attack, when he was 'troubled but not desperate', and they had arranged to meet the next day. Scene of crime: Williams was a resident of Sirhowy Arms Hotel in Caerphilly, a bail hostel manned by security guards, but his mother said he was released without any medication for his mental illness . He said: 'People say all sorts in prison but he seemed to mean it. He said he had already eaten someone. I put it down to talk — until I heard what he'd done'. Meanwhile, South Wales Police has launched a murder investigation after the deaths and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) will also probe the incident. History: Williams was jailed for five years for attacking a girlfriend and had a reputation in his home town for being extremely violent . A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice confirmed a serious further offence review will take place to see if lessons can be learned from the case. Such reviews are immediately launched if a serious offence is alleged to have happened within 30 days of a person leaving prison or is on licence. The review will examine the circumstances of Miss Yemm's death, the management of Williams following his release and whether steps can be taken to improve public protection. Welsh Assembly member William Graham has led calls for an inquiry into reports Williams was not monitored upon his release from prison. 'It is now clear that Mr Williams posed a risk to the public and I am extremely concerned that monitoring appears to have been deemed unnecessary,' Mr Graham told the BBC. 'If true, a wider inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his release is urgently required.' Gwent Police said Williams became unresponsive while under arrest and officers and paramedics administered first aid but he was pronounced dead. A post-mortem examination was due to be carried out on Williams, a resident of the Sirhowy Arms Hotel, on Saturday, a spokesman for the IPCC said. Miss Yemm's death is being treated as murder and police are not looking for anyone else. Her family, and officers who attended the incident, are being supported by specialist officers. Detectives have refused to comment on the specifics of the tragedy but sources confirmed Miss Yemm suffered substantial facial injuries. Chief Inspector Paul Staniforth of Gwent Police told reporters on Saturday: 'The post-mortem for Cerys will start today, but will take some time. 'Speculation about what happened at the scene and the cause of death is unhelpful and very upsetting for the family of the deceased.' Miss Yemm, who worked in sales at Next, is believed to have met Williams through mutual friends. Tragedy: Miss Yemm, left, had only met her murderer hours beforehand during a night out in Caerphilly. The 22-year-old returned to the hostel where he was staying where staff discovered the grisly scene . Forensic investigators at the scene in Caerphilly, south Wales, where cannibal killer Matthew Williams was Tasered and taken into police custody. He later died . A friend, described as a 'key prosecution witness', told the Sunday Times that Williams had taken a cocktail of drugs on Thursday evening, when he met Miss Yemm. 'He had an ounce of miaow miaow on him and at some stage during the night he injected himself,' the man, who did not wish to be named, told the paper. 'He was also taking large quantities of prescription beta blockers given to him to help overcome his drugs habit.' The man said Williams was given the prescription upon his release from prison a couple of weeks ago. Her family are being supported at their home in nearby Oakdale by specialist officers, who said relatives were too distraught to talk to the press.","Cerys Yemm was savagely murdered by Matthew Williams on November 6 .

"Adolf Hitler’s personal address book for Munich that lists him as a writer has emerged for sale. The document comes with the original receipt dated December 19, 1931 and the Nazi leader has also signed and dated it. Also loosely inserted is a printed circular letter, addressed in typescript to Hitler, offering various different versions of the book. Dial Hitler! Address book for the town of Munich and the surrounding area, 1932. Adolf Hitler's personal address book for Munich as the Nazi party was growing . In the 1932 directory Hitler is listed on page 413 as ‘schriftsteller’ - writer - because of the publication of his book Mein Kampf, My Struggle. That book is partly autobiographical and partly ideology, started by Hitler when he was in prison for what he considered to be political crimes after his failed Putsch, or coup, in Munich in November 1923. Mein Kampf was published two years later. Then he started to build a network of contacts around him for his next attempt to gain control of Germany. His address, in the contacts book, is listed as 16,2 Prinzregentplatz and the directory came from the personal collection of Hitler’s housekeeper, Annie Brunner. In the book: Hitler Adolf Writer Prinzregentenplatz 16,2 - his entry in the Munich address book up for sale in Shropshire . Under the hammer: the address book and a post card inserted (pictured here) from the Fuhrer. The book with its cards is expected to sell for £5,000 when it goes under the hammer at Mullock's auction house in Ludlow, Shropshire . The book was important, as . the Nazi party expanded its membership base in the early Thirties - all part of Hitler's plan to take control of the country. His office was at the National Socialist Party's HQ, The Brown House in Munich, named after the colour of the party uniforms. Also at the Brown House were Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Göring, Rudolf Hess. The Nazi party's headquarters in Munich from where Hitler was building his power base - the Munich address book was key in his campaign to lead the country . It was, however, damaged in October 1943 and largely . destroyed in an allied bombing raid late in World War II. The rubble was . cleared away in 1947, leaving an empty lot. Hitler committed suicide in his Berlin bunker by gunshot on 30 April 1945. His wife Eva Braun also killed herself with him by ingesting cyanide. The Munich address book was part of a collection given by Hitler to his housekeeper Annie that the German government tried to obtain for the State. In his heyday: Hitler, who committed suicide in his Berlin bunker by gunshot on 30 April 1945 . Annie fought to retain it and won a legal battle. It has since passed down to a private German collector who is now selling it. The document is expected to make up to £5,000 when it goes under the hammer at a Richard Westwood-Brookes sale in association with Mullock’s auction house in Ludlow, Shropshire. Mr Westwood-Brookes said: 'This is a unique document that was owned by Hitler when he lived in Munich in 1931. 'In it are several letters from the publishers and it also contains Hitler’s signature. 'It is a valuable historical item that lists Hitler as a writer because of the release of Mein Kampf. 'The book was a best seller and gave its author a decent income and during the year he bought the directory the Nazis were growing quickly and were the second largest party in Germany. 'While Hitler lived at the address given in the directory, the Nazi HQ was the Brown House in Munich. 'I’m sure there will be a great deal of interest in this fascinating historical document.'

"The parents of murdered schoolgirl April Jones  said today they were happy the 'house from hell' where she was killed is being demolished because it means  her 'spirit can be free'. Heartbroken Coral and Paul Jones spoke out as work started to tear down the rural home of her paedophile killer Mark Bridger in Ceinws, Mid Wales. The Welsh Government bought the white-washed cottage after Bridger was convicted of her murder and ordered it to be torn down. Today it is covered in scaffolding as experts remove the asbestos roof, before it is demolished in the coming weeks. Coral and Paul Jones have previously said they wanted the building replaced with blossom trees and a memorial bench. Scroll down for video . House from hell: The cottage rented by Mark Bridger, where he murdered April Jones, is covered in scaffolding as builders remove asbestos in the roof before knocking it down . Grim job: Builders will take the roof off piece by piece before demolishing the main building . At peace: April's parents Coral and Paul, right, say that their daughter's spirit can be free now Bridger's home is being pulled down . Bridger, who was jailed for life but has refused to admit to the crime, snatched April as she played in the  street near her home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales. Remorseless: Bridger has never admitted murder and will remain behind bars for the rest of his life . Large pools of April's blood were found under the carpet in front of the living room fire where small fragments of her bones were recovered by police. April's blood was also found in the bathroom and hallway of the cottage despite a desperate bid by Bridger to clean up his rented home using detergents and bleach. It is believed that he dumped most of her remains in a fast flowing river, and her body was never found. In a short statement released by her parents Coral and Paul today they said: 'The house from hell will no longer stand. April's spirit can be free.' April's disappearance sparked the largest police search in British history, and her killer Mark Bridger tried to cover his tracks by helping with the search before his arrest. Police raided his home and found evidence linked to the murder and a cache of child porn on his computer, including Facebook pictures of April and other local girls. Family friend Michael Williams, said the demolition of the house would help 'heal a huge wound' felt by the whole town. Scaffolding went up around the property on Saturday and workmen are removing asbestos found in the roof prior to the building being demolished - a process likely to take about two weeks. Cruel: April's disappearance sparked the biggest search operation in British history, but Bridger's attempts to hide his crime, carried out at home,  meant her body has never been found . Safety first: Builders have fenced off the white-washed cottage before it is razed to the ground . Killer: Mark Bridger, pictured,  murdered April after snatching her and was convicted last year. He is one of only around 50 criminals in British jails given whole life terms . Mr Williams said: 'It's a huge relief for Coral, Paul and the rest of April Jones' family, and also for the people of Ceinws who have to walk past that house - perhaps every day of the week - and do nothing but remember the horrible memories. 'It's a dark cloud that will be lifted from the minds of all the people of Machynlleth.' The Welsh Government paid the owner of the cottage £149,000 for the property, the same sum he had paid for it in 2008, after pleas from April's family for it to be demolished. Bridger was given a whole life sentence last year. He was convicted of abducting April, murdering her and perverting the course of justice by disposing of her body. Mark Bridger snatched April Jones and took her to his home where he murdered her - but when police found out he then came up with a series of bizarre and far-fetched excuses. April Jones's murderer was a serial offender with convictions relating to guns, thefts and road rage attacks, but bizarrely he tried to claim his violent past, dating back 28 years. Bridger wanted his criminal record laid bare during his murder trial so the jury would get to know that he had never been in the dock for sexual offences or for having indecent images of children. Taken in: Bridger minutes after his arrest as he was taken in for questioning - the murder then began to spout a series of bizarre lies about what had happened to April . This was despite the father of six having an obsession with child pornography, uncovered after police raided his home following April Jones’s disappearance in October 2012. Having first tried to hide his guilt by helping search for April, police pieced together that he was the prime suspect after his car Land Rover was seen near where she was taken. He then told police that he accidentally ran her over and meant to take her to hospital before ‘blacking out’ because of a combination of drink and panic. A forensic inspection of his car quickly proved this was a pack of lies. The police raided Bridger's home and found he had tried to cover his tracks by trying to clean his house from top to bottom. He had washed his clothes, carpets and upholstery while local people were out searching for April, before placing air fresheners in the rooms and cranking up the heating to dry the rooms quicker. Officers who searched the property said they were overwhelmed by the strong stench of bleach. Shocking: April's blood and bone fragments were found in the lounge of the house but her killer falsely claimed she had been hit by a car . April's blood had also been found in the bathroom - despite Bridger's attempts to clean his house from top to bottom . Cold blooded: Bridger made a number of attempts to hide the murder, but a full forensic examination of his cottage revealed what he had done . But despite this police found blood stains and fragments of April's bones - although her remains were believed to have been thrown in the nearby river. The blood stains had a 'one in a billion' match to April's DNA profile were found near the wood burning stove, on the carpet and on the sofa. April’s blood was found in his living room, hallway, the bathroom door, washing machine door and the shower curtain, the court heard. Once police confronted Bridger about the child skull bones in his fireplace he said that  they were from a chicken supper he cooked for his children. Blood under the carpet at his home was because he placed April in front of  the fire to keep her warm, he said, as part of his lies about hitting her with a car. His then told detectives the child pornography on his computer was because he wanted to track the physical development of his own children.","Mark Bridger abducted April before killing her in his white-washed cottage .

"Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has announced that a British Bill of Rights should include special legal protection for journalists . A new Bill of Rights should include special legal protections for Britain’s journalists and its 300-year-old free Press, the Culture Secretary will say today. Sajid Javid will commit the Tories to changes that will strengthen the law around Press freedoms if the party wins next year’s general election. In a speech to the Society of Editors, the minister will announce that a Conservative government will replace Labour’s Human Rights Act with a new British Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. ‘Passed in our Parliament and rooted in our values, it will restore British judges as the ultimate arbiters of British justice,’ he will say. ‘I’m delighted to announce that I have agreed with the Justice Secretary that the British Bill of Rights will include specific protection for journalists and a free Press. ‘The Human Rights Act and the European Court of Human Rights have not done enough to protect journalists who play such a unique role in our society. Our British Bill of Rights will change that.’ The minister will consult on the specific measures to be included, but they are expected to include a new legal right for journalists to protect their sources as well as a broad new public interest defence. At the moment, the rights of the Press are enshrined in a series of different Acts including the Human Rights Act, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, the Data Protection Act, the Defamation Act and the Contempt of Court Act. Aides said a new Bill of Rights would offer an opportunity to ‘abandon this piecemeal approach and ensure Press freedom is enshrined in legislation clearly, unequivocally and in one place’. Following the Leveson Inquiry and the row over Press regulation, Mr Javid has attempted to reassure critics of government handling of the issue. He said soon after his appointment this year: ‘The Press is hugely important and freedom of speech is a cornerstone of our democracy. I’m proud of the Press. ‘Notwithstanding the fact that any industry has its bad apples, I think our Press is the best in the world. It is fearless without favour.’ Home Secretary Theresa May has vowed to tighten the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act which has been used by police to access journalists’ phone records without a judge’s approval . The Conservatives plan to publish a draft Bill around the end of the year. Home Secretary Theresa May has vowed to tighten the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act which has been used by police to access journalists’ phone records without a judge’s approval. It has emerged in recent weeks that police have been using the legislation to force telecoms companies to hand over information without customers’ knowledge. Detectives investigating disgraced MP Chris Huhne’s speeding fraud secretly obtained a Mail on Sunday reporter’s phone records without his consent, despite laws protecting confidential journalistic sources. The Government has also announced a review of the introduction of time limits on police bail. Some journalists accused of phone hacking and other offences have been left on police bail for more than two years. Viscount Rothermere, chairman of DMGT, publisher of the Daily Mail, warned last month of an ‘anti-Press climate’ and said journalists were being ‘crushed by the full weight of the law’ – in sharp contrast with ‘those in the City whose greed almost caused our entire banking system to collapse’.","Bill of Rights should include protection for the Press, Culture Secretary says .

"The earliest surviving intact European book, which lay buried in a saint's coffin for hundreds of years, has been bought by the British Library for £9million. The seventh century St Cuthbert Gospel is on show at the library in King's Cross, north London. It was purchased and saved for the nation after a multimillion-pound fundraising effort. Europe's earliest book: The seventh century St Cuthbert Gospel lay buried in a saint's coffin for hundreds of years and has now been bought by the British Library for £9million . Time capsule: The book was produced in the north of England in the late seventh century . St Cuthbert was born circa 634 in Northumbria and is regarded as one of the most important medieval saints in England. He was inspired to become a monk, and later a bishop, after spotting a vision in the night sky while working as a shepherd in 651. St Aidan, the founder of Lindisfarne, died that same night - Cuthbert immediately vowed to follow a monastic path. He was a monk at Melrose Abbey between 651 to 664, after which he became prior at Lindisfarne until 676. In 684, he became bishop of Lindisfarne but resigned in late 686 as he thought he was on the verge of dying. He was buried at Lindisfarne Prior in 687 before his coffin was moved to Durham Cathedral to escape Viking raiders. Dame Lynne Brindley, the British . Library's chief executive, said: 'This was a once-in-a-lifetime . opportunity to secure the Gospel for the nation and we were both . grateful and touched that so many people felt moved to support our . campaign.' The . book was produced in the north of England in the late seventh century . and buried alongside St Cuthbert, an early English Christian leader, on . the island of Lindisfarne off the coast of Northumberland in around . AD698. The coffin was moved . off the island to escape Viking raiders and taken to Durham, where the . book, which is a copy of the Gospel of St John, was found when the . coffin was opened at the cathedral in 1104. Its original red leather . binding survives today. In the beginning was the word: The first page of the St Cuthbert Gospel, a remarkably preserved palm-sized book which is a manuscript copy of the Gospel of John in Latin . The book was produced in the north of England and buried alongside St Cuthbert (pictured) The single largest contribution to . the campaign was a £4.5million grant from the National Heritage Memorial .

Anglo-Saxon period is to see it exactly as those who created it in the . seventh century would have seen it. 'The exquisite binding, the pages, even the sewing structure survive intact, offering us a direct connection with our forebears 1,300 years ago. 'Its importance in the history of the book and its association with one of Britain’s foremost saints make it unique, so I am delighted to announce the successful acquisition of the St Cuthbert Gospel by the British Library. 'This precious item will remain in public hands so that present and future generations can learn from it.' The book will also go on show in Durham next year. The Very Rev Michael Sadgrove, Dean of Durham, said: 'It is the best possible news to know that the Cuthbert Gospel has been saved for the nation. For the people of Durham and north-east England, this is a most treasured book. Buried with Cuthbert and retrieved from his coffin, it held a place of great honour in Durham Cathedral Priory.' Initial resting place: The book was buried alongside the English Christian leader at Lindisfarne Priory (pictured) off the coast of Northumberland in around AD698, before being moved to Durham to escape Viking raiders .

"The first coin ever issued in Scotland - a penny - sold at auction yesterday for a staggering £8,400. The rare silver penny was produced in Carlisle, Cumberland, 875 years ago by the Scottish King David I after he took over the town and its mint, and his name and crest can still clearly be seen on the coin. It was discovered near Harrogate in North Yorkshire in 1998, and is one of fewer than ten known examples ever found and still in existence today. Rare: The first penny issued in Scotland sold at auction yesterday for £8,400 by London based auctioneer Spink to a private collector . It is thought to have been lost by a Scottish soldier 874 years ago in August 1138 at the Battle of the Standard near Northallerton in North Yorkshire, in which King David was defeated by an army led by the Archbishop of York. A bidding war at Spinks sale in London pushed the selling price way beyond its initial £2,500 estimate. A private collector in the auction room finally made the winning bid. Spink's coin specialist William Mackay said: 'This is a truly historic coin, as it is the first ever issued for Scotland, which explains the considerable interest in it. 'The buyer has acquired a very special piece of Scottish history and I am delighted that its significance has been acknowledged in this way, by achieving a well-deserved price.' Sale: Spinks had originally estimated the coin would go for around £2,500 but the unique find sparked a bidding war . King Henry I of England, who died in 1135, had established a mint at Carlisle, which is thought to have made silver pennies, using the silver from mines in the North Pennines. In 1136 King David I of Scotland, who lived from 1124-53, took over Cumberland and with it, the Carlisle Mint. He continued to strike silver pennies there, but from that moment on, they were produced in his own name as King of Scotland. In so doing the first Scottish coinage was created. Previous to this, no coins had been issued by the Scots. Unusual: The coin was discovered near Harrogate in North Yorkshire in 1998, and is one of fewer than ten known examples ever found and still in existence today . Mr Mackay added: 'This coin was produced . by Erebald, the same person as those of Carlisle, for Henry I during . his rule and are similar in type as those issued for Henry I, with one . difference, that they were produced in the name of David I, King of . Scotland. 'David I, of Scotland who had lands in England, played a leading part in the early troubled years of the reign of King Stephen of England (1135-54) and invaded the north of England. 'In the absence of Stephen, who was engaged in the south, the northern barons led by Thurstan, Archbishop of York, gathered an army and defeated David I at the Battle of the Standard near Northallerton in North Yorkshire in August 1138. 'The loss of this coin, found near Harrogate is believed to be associated with his invasion of the north and subsequent defeat.' History: In 1136 King David I of Scotland took over Cumberland and the Carlisle Mint - in so doing the first Scottish coinage was created .","First coin ever issued in Scotland sells at auction for a staggering £8,400 .

"Newly released emails show Attorney General Eric Holder said that Justice Department prosecutors who were critical of the department's handling of the fallout of the Fast and Furious gun-walking scandal could 'kiss my ass.' Fast and Furious was a botched effort by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to track firearms across the Southwest border. Revelations about it created a political firestorm, leading to congressional investigations and turnover within the ATF and Justice Department. Newly released emails show Holder said that prosecutors who were critical of the department's handling of the fallout of the Fast and Furious gun-walking scandal could 'kiss my ass' The Justice Department provided a batch of emails to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The Associated Press obtained the emails on Friday. House Republicans, who have subpoenaed for thousands of emails and went to federal court for access to the documents, have long promoted the idea that Holder knew that federal agents had engaged in a risky tactic known as 'gun-walking.' The Justice Department's inspector general found no evidence that Holder was aware of the tactic, in which ATF agents tried to track the flow of illegal guns from the United States into Mexico but instead lost track of many of the weapons. In one email from March 2011, after being sent a news story about the Fast and Furious investigation, Holder told staff, 'I hope there is another side to the story.' FAST AND FURIOUS AND DEADLY: 'Operation Fast and Furious' involved straw-buyers who sent 2,000 gus to Mexico with help from the ATF, which hoped to track the firearms to drug cartels – but failed . Later, after the ATF deputy director told Holder aides that 'we did not allow guns to walk,' Holder responded to staff with, 'Do they really, really know?' That August, Holder was told by staff that a group of U.S. attorneys was upset that the resignation of Dennis Burke, then the U.S. attorney in Arizona, was announced simultaneously with the reassignment of ATF Acting Director Ken Melson. Holder replied, 'Some people can kiss my ass.' In another 2011 email Holder vented to colleagues about GOP congressional investigator Darrell Issa 'and his idiot cronies.' The angry remark appears in an email Holder sent to his top deputies at the Justice Department, calling out the chair of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. One was the murder weapon that killed U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in December 2010. The Holder email was part of a massive document dump that the Justice Department released on Election Day as Americans were occupied with voting and watching, breath-bated, for results. 'ISSA AND HIS IDIOT CRONIES': The depths of outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder's hatred for Republican House oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa slipped out in an email just released . Little media coverage attended the cache, which amounted to 64,280 pages. The DOJ had refused to turn over those documents, and more, since Issa's committee subpoenaed them in October 2011. Holder was later held in criminal Contempt of Congress for refusing, making him the only presidential cabinet member in U.S. history to wear that badge of dishonor. In the April 15, 2011 email, Holder was responding to threats from Issa's committee staffers that they would issue subpoenas to force gun dealers – Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) in government-speak – to tell what they knew. One FFL's attorney shared the back-and-forth with the Justice Department. Matthew Axelrod, then the Associate Deputy Attorney General in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,described the situation in an email whose subject line was 'Possible subpoena for cooperating FFL.' His attorney, Axelrod wrote, had 'told Issa’s staff that his client has a variety of concerns with testifying, including the fact that he is a witness in a criminal matter and concerns for his safety.' ISSA ON THE WARPATH: Rep. Darrell Issa (right) presides over the powerful House Oversight Committee, which has dragged Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) officials to Capitol Hill to account for the scandal . Committee staffers, he added, 'told him that it would be easier to keep this confidential if he was willing to come in for a voluntary interview. Counsel said that his client didn’t want to.' After Axelrod outlined the possibility that Issa might issue a subpoena forcing the gun dealer to testify, Holder's then-chief of staff Gary Grindler reached up the chain of command. 'This keeps escalating,' he emailed Holder. That's when his boss lost patience. 'Issa and his idiot cronies never gave a damn about this when all that was happening was that thousands of Mexicans were being killed with guns from our country,' he fumed in an email to Grindler, Deputy AG James Cole, and Cole's chief of staff Stuart Goldberg. 'All they want to do – in reality – is cripple ATF and suck up to the gun lobby. Politics at its worst – maybe the media will get it.' Fast and Furious weapons had already been turning up at the scenes of Mexican gun crimes before Terry, the border patrol agent, was murdered. REST IN PEACE: A Mexican national killed US Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry with a gun that the Obama administration's Justice Department allowed a straw-buyer to traffick south of the border . NO CHOICE: ATF agents leaned on gun dealers in the American southwest to sell guns illegally in order to supply hte Fast and Furious program with weapons that could be sent into Mexico . Issa's investigation has uncovered evidence that a year before Holder's angry email outburst, some in the ATF sought to use the Fast and Furious program to build a case for a new gun control measure known inside the government as 'Demand Letter 3.' That plan was drawn up in order to use sales records from Fast and Furious-related purchases of large numbers of so-called 'long guns' – rifles and shotguns designed to be fired while braced against the shooter's shoulder – to force gun dealers everywhere to report the details of more of their sales to the federal government. It was so named because it was the third proposed regulation of its kind, . In one July 14, 2010 email the Oversight Committee has released, ATF Field Operations Assistant Director Mark Chait asked Bill Newell, ATF's Phoenix Special Agent in Charge, for help leveraging data from Fast and Furious. 'Bill – can you see if these guns were all purchased from the same FFL and at one time?' he asked. 'We are looking at anecdotal cases to support a demand letter on long gun multiple sales.' The massive tranche of emails released Tuesday, while the news media's attention was fixed on election maps and poling-place results, were brought about by a series of events primed by a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Judicial Watch, the center-right watchdog group famous for wringing incriminating paperwork out of secretive bureaucracies. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the Holder email criticizing Rep. Issa. After the DOJ refused to comply with the FOIA request, a federal judge ordered the government to release a 'Vaughn Index,' a specialized inventory of all the documents it was withholding coupled with a rationale for each. Many of those reasons seemed specious to the judge, who then ordered a similar disclosure to Issa's committee. MAN IN CHARGE? Then-Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler was Holder's point man on the 'gun-walking' debacle . The Justice Department, which has not commented on the Election Day document dump, chose to voluntarily release everything on Tuesday rather than face a judge's order to do it on a slow news day. The flood of documents that reached Capitol Hill, the Oversight Committee claimed in a press release, 'is an admission that the Justice Department never had legitimate grounds to withhold these documents in the first place.' 'Approximately two-thirds of the universe of documents that the Justice Department withheld from Congress has now been shown to be well outside the scope of Executive Privilege.' Issa said in a statement that '[w]hen Eric Holder wants to know why he was the first Attorney General held in criminal contempt of Congress, he can read the judge’s order that compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and President Obama illegitimately and illegally withheld from Congress.' Holder tendered his resignation in late September but will stay on until the White House can pick a successor who passes muster in the U.S. Senate.

"China is said to be behind a cyber attack on the U.S. Postal Service which has compromised information, including the Social Security numbers, of its 800,000 employees. The FBI and other federal agencies are investigating, the agency said in a statement. Postal Service spokesman David Partenheimer said personal information that may have been obtained in the attack includes employees' names, dates of birth,  addresses and emergency contacts. According to the Washington Post, the intrusion was discovered in mid-September, but the agency has declined to reveal who was behind it. Scroll down for video . Hacked: The U.S. Postal Service said Monday it is the victim of a cyberattack and that information about its employees, including Social Security numbers, may have been compromised . The news was announced as President Obama landed in Beijing for talks with his counterpart, President Xi Jinping, as well as for an economic summit. China has consistently denied that it is behind such attacks. Partenheimer said the intrusion was carried out by a 'sophisticated actor that appears not to be interested in identity theft or credit card fraud.' He also reiterated that customers at local post offices or those using its website, usps.com, were not affected. But people who used its call center may have had telephone numbers, email addresses and other information compromised. The agency isn't recommending that those customers take any action. The Postal Service provided no immediate information on how many people may have been affected. It employs over 617,000 workers. 'The intrusion is limited in scope and all operations of the Postal Service are functioning normally,' Partenheimer said. 'It is an unfortunate fact of life these days that every organization connected to the Internet is a constant target for cyber intrusion activity,' Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said in a statement. 'The United States Postal Service is no different.' 'Fortunately, we have seen no evidence of malicious use of the compromised data and we are taking steps to help our employees protect against any potential misuse of their data.'

The heartbreaking scenes in the Liberian capital show the tragic reality of living in a city ravaged by Ebola and the terrible impact on the victims' loved ones . The worst-ever Ebola epidemic has already claimed more than 4,400 lives, with the vast majority of the victims living in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. More than half the dead have been in Liberia, where the healthcare system is still reeling from a devastating 1989-2003 civil war. Healthcare unions in Liberia called off a strike today over pay and working conditions for medical staff tackling the epidemic. The strike, which began on Monday, garnered poor support and most hospitals and clinics in the West African country had been operating normally.

'We have called for the strike action to be called off on humanitarian grounds,' said George Williams, secretary-general of the National Health Workers Association of Liberia. 'Our doors are open for negotiations at a later date...but as of now we call off the action based on numerous appeals from the Liberian people both home and the diaspora.'

WHO assistant director-general Dr. Bruce Aylward said that the 70 per cent death rate of Ebola was 'a high mortality disease' in any circumstance. Previously, WHO had said the death rate was around 50 per cent. He said the U.N. health agency was still focused on trying to treat Ebola patients, despite the huge demands on the broken health systems in West Africa. 'It would be horrifically unethical to say that we're just going to isolate people,' he said, noting that new strategies like handing out protective equipment to families and setting up very basic clinics - without much treatment - was a priority.

"When the creator of Harry Potter decides to build an adventure playground for her children, you expect something magical. But even by JK Rowling’s standards the 40ft high, two-storey tree houses planned for the back garden of her Edinburgh  mansion are something spectacular. The Hogwarts-style towers - estimated to cost around £150,000 - are so big that they need planning permission. Victory: Harry Potter author JK Rowling has won a battle to build two luxury tree houses in the garden of her home despite protests from local residents. This picture shows a computer simulation of the twin tree houses . Expense: The writer had applied to have the massive structures, estimated to cost £250,000, erected as part of a programme of renovations at her house in Edinburgh . Each wooden tree house is to be built on stilts and boasts balconies, carvings and turrets that wouldn’t look out of place in a Potter adventure. The towers are linked by a rope bridge and can be approached by a secret tunnel hidden underneath a raised wooden walkway. Plans lodged with the City of Edinburgh Council reveal the houses are intended for Miss Rowling’s two youngest children David, nine, and his sister Mackenzie, seven. Children's dream: Each wooden tree house is to be built on stilts and boasts balconies, carvings and turrets that wouldn't look out of place in a Potter adventure . Eco conscience: JK Rowling's tree houses will only be built with timber from sustainably managed forests . According to the drawings ‘David’s Tree . House’ is closest to the secret tunnel and has a specially designed trap . door and fireman’s pole escape into the garden . Meanwhile . ‘Kenzie’s Tree House’ has its own spiral staircase and a stainless . steel playground slide leading to a double set of swings. A . wooden walkway connected to the giant structure leads to a giant . trampoline deck that is shielded from public view by a row of extra tall . conifers. Impressive: Hogwarts as it appears in the film Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone . Intricate design: After the extraordinary plans were submitted with Edinburgh City Council last month, objections were lodged by people who live nearby . Bespoke fun: Plans reveal the houses are intended for Miss Rowling's two youngest children David, nine, and his sister Mackenzie, seven . The design by the luxury tree house makers Blue Forest UK features cedar shingle roofs and a built in ‘nature box’ for birds to nest in. Miss Rowling, 46, lives in her 17th century mansion with her husband Dr Neil Murray, their two young children and her 18-year-old daughter Jessica, from her first marriage . JK Rowling’s tree houses will only be built with timber from sustainably managed forests. Miss Rowling, 46, bought her 17th century mansion for more than £2 million in 2009 when she reportedly fell in love with it after viewing just two of its 31 rooms. She lives there with her husband Dr Neil Murray, their two young children and her 18-year-old daughter Jessica, from her first marriage. The property has been dubbed ‘Fortress Rowling’ by some because of its security fences and reinforced doors. Giant trees were lifted by crane over the garden walls to give the author and her family more privacy. Last year JK Rowling got planning permission to flatten a £1 million 1970s style house next door to make her garden larger. She also got approval to build a summer house that critics said looked like the stone hut inhabited by Hagrid, the giant groundsman from her best-selling novels. Yesterday a neighbour said: ‘Nobody around here is going to make a fuss about the tree houses for her children. It’s her cash she can do what she wants with it. ‘Miss Rowling has spent a lot of money on trees surrounding her property so even if these tree houses are huge nobody but her is going to see them. In any case she’s extremely nice and well-liked around here.’ A source at Edinburgh Council said: ‘It would be highly unlikely that JK Rowling will not get permission for these tree houses. ‘They are only for her children to play in, she’s not seeking permission for residential permission for them.’ JK Rowling is worth around £560 million according to the 2012 Sunday Times Rich List. She is reported to have given away more than £100 million to charity. Wealthy: Daniel Radcliffe is pictured as Harry Potter. Creator JK Rowling is worth around £560 million according to the 2012 Sunday Times Rich List . Blue Forest, based in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, describes itself as the UK’s leading tree house architects. It specialises in creating ‘fantasy castles’ like those for JK Rowling’s children or ‘James Bond-style hideaways’ with luxuries such as under floor heating, wood burning stoves and plasma screen televisions. Prices start at £20,000 for its most basic models, but the firm admits the ‘sky is the limit’ for the final bill when it creates bespoke tree houses for the super-rich. The firm’s managing director Andy Payne said: ‘Tree houses have always been a symbol of imagination and creativity.’ Tree houses are generally considered temporary structures and therefore do not need planning permission. However this only applies if they are less than 13 feet high from roof to base. Last night a spokesman for JK Rowling said she would not be commenting on the tree houses. She said: ‘It is a private matter.’","The Hogwarts-style towers - estimated to cost around £150,000 – are so big that they need planning permission .

"With less than three months to go before the birth of her first baby, the Duchess of Cambridge is clearly in the mood for a little nesting. And who better to take on a shopping trip to furnish her future prince or princess’s new nursery at Kensington Palace than her mother, Carole Middleton. The pair were spotted in upmarket South Kensington together, browsing some of the capital’s most exclusive baby stores after enjoying a spot of lunch together at the Zefi Mediterranean restaurant where they were seen by fellow diners sipping healthy fruit juices. The Duchess of Cambridge was spotted with her mother Carole Middleton during a shopping trip in South Kensington, where they bought a large white wicker Moses basket for the imminent arrival of the royal baby . Kate wore a loose blue maternity top with a pretty lace collar for the outing . The Duchess and her mother were seen dining in a nearby Mediterranean restaurant before their visit to a children's clothing and furniture store . Carole carried the Moses basket out of Blue Almonds, where prices go up to £295 for an off the shelf model . First on their list was Blue Almonds, which boasts that it creates ‘magical rooms for children’ - perfect for the third in line to the throne. Dressed in identical dark blue skinny jeans and knee-high black boots, mother and daughter spent up to an hour browsing the Moses baskets on sale. Priced up to £295 for an off the shelf model, they are certainly out of reach price-wise for many new mothers-to-be. Some bespoke versions at the store can cost up to £1,000 and be customised with frilled fitted sheets and sun shades. Kate, 31, who was wearing a loose blue maternity top with a pretty white lace collar, and her mother finally settled on a large white wicker version and walked out into the street together, clearly discussing their purchase. They were then whisked off by a waiting car driven by one of Kate’s bodyguards, presumably back to Kensington Palace where Kate is overseeing the renovation of her new apartment. Kate spent up to an hour inside the children's clothing and furniture store with her mother . The shop owner would not discuss Kate's purchases but said she was 'honoured' to receive a visit . A bodyguard was waiting to drive the Duchess and her mother away, presumably to Kensington Palace where Kate is overseeing the refurbishment of her future family home, Apartment 1A . The Duchess and her mother both wore dark blue skinny jeans with knee-high black boots for the shopping trip . As revealed by the Mail, work on Apartment 1A, once the home of the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, will not be finished until at least September or October this year, well after the birth of her baby. Kate and her husband, Prince William, are currently living in a small two-up, two-down cottage in the grounds, which is less than ideal to bring a royal heir home to. As a result, say sources, Kate has decided to eschew the help of a maternity nurse and spend the first six weeks after her child’s birth living with her parents at their new £4.8million Georgian mansion in Bucklebury, Berkshire. She has told friends that she cannot think of anyone better suited to helping her in those first difficult few weeks than her mother, who has brought up three children of her own. ‘It’s where I feel safest,’ she has said. Kate and Carole settled on a large white wicker version of the basket and were clearly discussing their purchase as they walked towards their waiting car . Kate is to move in with her mother at the Middleton family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, after the birth and preparations for the royal arrival look to be well underway . Carole is said to be nervous but thrilled at the prospect of becoming a grandmother for the first time . The Duchess carried two handbags while Carole took care of carrying the large white wicker Moses basket . Carole, for her part, is said to be nervous but thrilled at the prospect of becoming a grandmother for the first time - to a future king or queen at that. Although Izabela Minkiewicz, the owner of Blue Almonds, has declined to comment on the Duchess’s purchases, she confirmed that she was ‘honoured’ to have received a visit from her. ‘We spend a great deal of time making sure that we get to know the client, their particular taste and demands,’ she said. Prince Harry was spotted carrying a teddy bear for his future niece or nephew yesterday as he arrived home to Kensington Palace. He had promised a wellwisher in Nottingham this week that he would pass on the gift . The shopping trip came at a busy time for the Duchess, who yesterday gave her first public video message appealing for support for Children's Hospice Week . Kate also joined her husband Prince William and brother-in-law Prince Harry at the opening of the Warner Brothers Studios in Leavesden where they had a go at wand work on the set of the Harry Potter films . The Duchess carried out a charity engagement at the National Portrait Gallery on Wednesday and prompted a rush on Topshop's website when she wore their spotted dress, right, to the Warner Brothers Studios on Friday . The following day Kate was seen back out shopping for baby goods again at the Peter Jones department store in Chelsea, where she spent several hours mulling over buggies and a car seat. The Duchess has revealed that her baby is due in mid-July and that she will be going on maternity leave around a month earlier but insists, contrary to speculation, that she and William have chosen not to discover the sex of their first child.","The Duchess and her mother were spotted shopping in South Kensington .

"Two boy racers killed Lucy Commins, 16, when they crashed their souped-up cars during a street race . Two boy racers killed a 16-year-old girl when they crashed their souped-up cars during a high speed street race. Lucy Commins was a passenger in a Mercedes CLK when the car collided with a VW Golf being driven by Sean Sparkes, 32, in Coventry on February 22. He had been racing against Reece Jones, 23, who was in a Ford Fiesta, when he lost control and ploughed into the other car at around 11.25pm. Warwick Crown Court heard the pair had been racing each-other at high speeds when the Mercedes pulled out of a side road in front of them. Lucy was pronounced dead at the scene at the junction of Hinckley Road and Woodway Lane in Coventry. Sparkes' Golf smashed into the Mercedes, while Jones - who was disqualified from driving at the time -  managed to swerve round it and speed off. He then drove away in his distinctive Fiesta which he then hid before changing its appearance to cover his tracks. Sparkes and Jones were jailed  after admitting one count each of causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Sparkes, from Bulkington, Warwikshire, was sentenced to five years and nine months and another nine months for perverting the course of justice. He was also given a two-year-and-six-month sentence, to be served concurrently, for causing serious injury to the other passenger. He was disqualified from driving for four years and will have to take an extended retest before he can return to the road. Jones, from Wyken, in Coventry, was jailed for a total of seven years and three months for death by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice. He was also disqualified from driving for five years. Speaking in a statement after her death Lucy's devastated family said: 'We would like to take this opportunity to thank well-wishers and pay tribute to our beautiful daughter. 'The sudden and tragic loss of Lucy has left her family and friends devastated. 'Lucy lived life to the full. She loved to socialise with friends, loved animals and listening to music, she could not decide if she wanted to be a vet or a DJ. 'We would also like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to those who organised events and made donations in Lucy's memory. 'Their help was very much appreciated.' After the hearing Lucy's family released another tribute to the popular teenager in a statement issued by police . Lucy was a passenger when the car she was in collided with a VW Golf being driven by Sean Sparkes, 32, (right) He had been racing against Reece Jones, 23, (left) who was in a Ford Fiesta, when he lost control . They added: 'From the moment Lucy was born she was our princess. 'Lucy was a very happy, caring girl who loved life and enjoyed spending time with friends and family. 'Lucy was a typical teenager who had lots of goals and aims in life. 'She couldn't wait to leave college, pass her driving test and eventually start a family of her own. 'Lucy had so much life ahead of her and we will all miss out on seeing her achieve her goals and grow into a woman. 'The whole family is broken and we will never be the same again. 'All the material possessions in the world could never replace a child. We would rather be penniless and living in a cardboard box if it would mean having our little girl back. 'We will never again be able to hear her voice, hold her close, see her smile or hear her cheeky laugh. Lucy was pronounced dead at the scene at the junction of Hinckley Road and Woodway Lane in Coventry. Her family described her as a 'very happy, caring girl who loved life' 'Any sentence given will never be enough as it will not bring our baby back. 'The people responsible have not only taken Lucy's life, they have taken the life from our whole family. We are left serving a life sentence. 'Lucy's four-year- old niece says goodnight to the stars and kisses Lucy's picture every night, and her 10 year old niece wrote about her and said ""She used to look after me and my little sister and she used to take us everywhere. I still can't believe I'm not going to see her again until I go to heaven."" 'The family would like to thank everyone concerned for their help and support at this difficult time.

"Security company G4S were forced to spend almost half a million pounds changing all of the locks at a prison they were contracted to run - after blundering guards lost the keys. The firm has to replace every lock and key at HMP Birmingham, known as Winson Green jail, when the set of keys vanished in October 2011 - costing £499,000. The embarrassing blunder came just days after G4S took over the management of the prison - with 1,400 bring confined to their cells while the premises was searched. Blunder: Security company G4S had to spend £499,00 changing all of the locks at Birmingham's Winson Green jail - after blundering guards lost the keys . A source told the Sunday People that the jail has been in a state of chaos ever since. He said: 'There are staff shortages and inmates have been pushing their luck.' West Midlands Police arrested a man in his 30s over the lost keys but no charges were pursued. The gaffe is just one in a series of embarrassments for the company - who had to pay out £70million after failing to provide enough guards for the London Olympics. Formerly known as Group 4 - the company earned an unfavourable reputation for losing prisoners they were minding. Prisons minister Andrew Selous, left, and G4S Chief Executive Nick Buckles giving evidence on Olympic security staffing to the Home Affairs Select Committee at the House of Commons in 2012, right . Catalogue of errors: The blunder is the latest in a series of embarrassing mistakes made by the security firm . In January, G4S were forced to play down a 'full scale riot' at Britain's largest privately-run jail - which saw inmates take over an entire wing and booby-trap the doorways, a prison officer claimed. Inmates had a nine-hour stand-off with guards at  HMP Oakwood near Wolverhampton, nicknamed 'Jokewood' for its alleged lax security. Figures from Prisons minister Andrew Selous show that keys have been lost 237 times at jails since 2010, costing taxpayers £493,161. The three most expensive prison lock and key replacements at prisons since 2010 are: . Mr Selous said: 'Security and protecting the public is paramount and we replace compromised locks as quickly as possible. We are also increasing use of electronic and biometric systems. 'Under the previous Government nearly £700, 000 was spent in two years alone - but in recent years the cost of these incidents to the taxpayer has fallen significantly. 'The incident at HMP Birmingham in 2011 came at no cost to the taxpayer.' The most expensive key and lock replacements were at Glen Parva, Leicestershire (£208,329), Warren Hill, Suffolk (£101,301) and Swaleside, Kent (£95,430). This year keys have been lost at Lindholme, South Yorkshire (£40,286), Haverigg, Cumbria (£32,882) and Highpoint, Suffolk (£14,933). A spokesman for G4S said: 'As has previously been extensively reported, this incident took place 18 days after G4S assumed responsibility for the establishment in 2011. 'Subsequently, G4S changed the keys for HMP Birmingham. G4S paid in full for this and, as a result, the UK taxpayer did not pay a single penny for this course of action. 'Since that time, G4S has examined, reviewed and amended the procedures and policies, which had been in place when it assumed responsibility for the establishment.'","Embarrassing blunder happened at Birmingham's Winson Green jail in 2011 .

"A workman watched his van go up smoke after his e-cigarette exploded while charging in the vehicle's cab. The Ford Transit was wrecked in a blaze on the driveway of a house in Rotherham on Friday morning. The vehicle's owner, kitchen fitter Garry Brookes, 48, said the blaze had done £23,000-worth of damage to the vehicle and the fire was so intense it even melted the front door of his customer's home. Scroll down for video . A van in Rotherham went up in smoke last week after the driver left an e-cigarette charging on the front seat . Kitchen fitter Garry Brookes, 48, said the blaze had caused around £23,000 worth of damage to his vehicle . Father-of-two Mr Brookes plugged his e-cigarette in to his van after it ran out of battery - but just an hour later he watched in horror as his van burst into a ball of flames. He said: 'It was on a customer's drive and it had been there for about an hour when I just went to pack things up. 'I noticed there was smoke and I was running round and noticed all my paperwork was on fire. I just looked and my charger was plugged in and I saw the back end had blown out. 'I tried to put the fire out and the customer was bringing buckets of water and a hose pipe.' The labourer has now been left with a shell of a van - with an estimated £23,000 worth of damage. Mr Brookes said: 'Within ten minutes the van was burnt out and was just a shell on four wheels. You wouldn't believe the damage it caused. 'It melted my customer's front door which was about six feet away from the van. I was amazed how quick it went. 'The next door neighbour saw what was happening and drove his expensive car off his drive, which was lucky because that would have gone up too.' Mr Brookes had left an e-cigarette to charge in the van, but the device is thought to have exploded . After realising it was too late to save his van, Mr Brookes tried to salvage his tools. He said: 'Once I knew I couldn't save the van I thought ""my tools, my livelihood"". 'I was dragging things out of the back while it was still on fire. It was stupid getting in the back of the van when it was on fire but it was my livelihood.' Mr Brookes opted to smoke electronic cigarettes five months ago when he heard the news that his girlfriend's daughter was having a baby. He said: 'I started off with a £10 e-cig from my corner shop. Then when I thought these are good, I went to buy a good one. 'It was £39.99 and I always charged it in the van or in the house. I'm just glad that it didn't happen when I was driving because I wouldn't be walking now. 'It could have happened in the house when my kids were there and I'm just so thankful that it didn't.' The blaze lasted for close to half an hour before fire services were finally able to put it out. The Ford Transit was written off by the blaze, which laid waste to the engine and burnt through the cab . The heat of the fire was so intense that it even melted his customer's front door, six feet from the blazing van . Mr Brookes added: 'It was a proper bonfire when the fire service got there. It felt like a lifetime and I had to watch it happen. 'It's been the worst time of my life. It's this e-cig that's caused this mayhem and somebody should be liable. Now when I see people smoking e-cigarettes I tell them to put them in the bin.' Following the fire, and on the day the first TV adverts for e-cigarettes went on air, fire chiefs in South Yorkshire issued tips on the safe charging of the devices. Head of community safety for the service Kevin Ronan said: 'Fires caused by e-cigarettes are an emerging trend which, two years ago, simply did not exist. 'Whilst e-cigs may offer a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes, they are so popular now we do need to make sure people know how charge them safely. 'The advice for e-cigs is really the same as for many smaller electrical appliances like mobile phones and laptops - don't be tempted to buy cheap unbranded chargers, don't leave them to charge whilst you are out of the house or asleep and keep them well away from flammable materials.' The safety warning was released on the day the first advert for e-cigarettes was due to hit UK TV screens . Mr Ronan said fire investigators think fires start because e-cigarettes are left to charge too long, they are charged too close to soft furnishings or because the charger itself is faulty. Recent figures reveal electronic cigarettes have been linked to more than 100 fires. Fire services in the UK are now attending at least one blaze involving the devices each week, statistics suggest. They have attended dozens of incidents suspected to have been sparked by e-cigarettes or related equipment including chargers in less than three years. Firefighters have told e-cigarette users to: . - Charge the device on a flat, solid and stable surface, such as a kitchen worktop; . - Keep the device away from flammable or combustible materials when charging; . - Never leave the device on a bed or close to soft furnishings, or in a cluttered space; . - Don’t exceed the recommended charging time, or leave unattended for any significant length of time e.g. overnight while you’re asleep, or if you go out; . - Don’t buy cheap, unbranded chargers and always follow the manufacturer’s instructions. E-cigarette chargers, like this one which set fire to a building in London, are behind one blaze a week .","E-cigarette explodes after being left to charge in front of van in Yorkshire .

"A man who was mauled by a family of bears is lucky to be alive after he was attacked while hunting on a remote island off the coast of Alaska. Michael Snowden, 68, had to be transported by coast guards to Kodiak hospital to be treated  for serious leg injuries after his annual hunting trip in the Alaskan wilderness took an horrific turn . 'You could feel it puncture deeply and you could feel the teeth,' he told ABC News. The experienced hunter suddenly became the mighty beasts' prey when out of nowhere a 700 pound bear pounced upon him. Survivor: 68-year-old Michael Snowden and his son-in-law Jeff Ostrin are speaking out over their terrifying clash with a pack of brown bear . Bitten: Out of nowhere at 700 pound bear pounced on Snowden. ""You could feel it puncture deeply and you could feel the teeth' he said . 'I could see him just shaking his head with his teeth buried in my leg. I was being tossed about like a rag doll.' A group of up to five bears attacked Mr Snowden and his son-in-law Jeff Ostrin as they dragged the carcass of a deer they had shot through dense vegetation on Sally Island in Uganik Bay. The animal attacked Mr Snowden, biting and scratching his body before Mr Ostrin jumped into action, firing three shots at the bear and killing it to save his father-in law. 'i was terrified for Mike, I was terrified for myself,' he said. Hero: Jeff Ostrin jumped into action firing three shots at the bear and killing it to save his father-in law . Gratitude: 'If it hadn't have been for my son-in-law i doubt i would have survived this attack', Mr Snowden said . The deer hunter: The blood that was coming from the deeer carcas they were dragging through the woods is likely to blame for their grisley encouvnter . Within moments, as another grisly made a run for them, Mr Ostrin reloaded his rifle and his courage. 'I had to protect both of us for either of us to have a chance make it out of there.' But it wasn't over yet - a third bear came on scene and the pair had to scream at it, in order to make it run away. Mr Snowden suffered deep gashes to his thigh and needed 100 staples to close the wounds, but he is expected to make a full recovery. 'If it hadn't have been for my son-in-law I doubt I would have survived this attack', Mr Snowden said. Partners: The two hunters are recovering after coming face-to-face with a family of bears some 35 miles away from civilization . Lucky to be alive: Snowden needed 100 staples but He is expected to make a full recovery . The blood that was coming from the deer carcass they were dragging through the woods is likely to blame for their grisly encounter . The attack took place last week on a remote island off the southern coast of mainland Alaska. The state is home to 98 per cent of the United States' total brown bear population. Mr Snowden and his son-in-law were dragging a deer through vegetation when they stopped for lunch. No sooner had they sat down to eat when a large female bear charged at them. Seconds later, more bears emerged, with Ostrin shooting and killing one of the cubs. The shooting scared the rest of the animals away. Rescue: Mr Snowden is now safe in a Kodiak hospital where he was airlifted by coastguard helicopters after the pairs annual deer hunting trip in the Alaskan wilderness took an horrific turn . Prominent: The attack took place last week on a remote island off the southern coast of mainland Alaska. The state is home to 98 per cent of the United States' total brown bear population . A crew on board a fishing vessel witnessed the entire incident and reportedly raced to the shore to remove the men to the safety of the sea, with the captain calling the coast guard to the scene. Mr Snowden was first transported by helicopter to Kodiak Municipal Airport, before being taken to the Providence Kodiak Island Medical Center where he was treated for his leg wounds. 'The fact that there were five bears was an abnormality and this serves as a reminder that anything can happen and we need to be aware of our surroundings,' said Lt. Joseph Schlosser, operational unit watchstander for the Coast Guard 17th District. Hunters in rural Alaska are told not to carry the entire carcasses of animals they have killed because bears are attracted by the smell of blood. Instead, hunters are advised to carefully butcher the animals where they died and place the meat into sealed containers.","Michael Snowden, 68, had been out hunting with his son-in-law .

"Southerners like Duchess of Cambridge favour the thick, natural South brow . Dark Scouse brow favoured by Northerners; Welsh opt for 'soft arch' West Midlanders like a happy brow whilst Irish prefer the tadpole look . From Coleen Rooney's thick Liverpool accent to Amy Childs' Essex twang, accents are a clear tell-tale sign of where a woman is from. But according to new research the shape of a woman’s eyebrows reveals where she is from even quicker than her accent. As brow bars and regional brow trends continue to take off, a study has revealed people can pinpoint where a woman is from by the shape of her eyebrows - before they even hear her accent. London and South East       Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds               Wales . Even Kate Middleton is braving the more thick and full 'south brow' Liverpool-born WAG Coleen embraces the thinner, more raised Scouse brow . The soft arched brow is favoured by glamorous Welsh export Catherine Zeta Jones . Ireland                         Midlands (Birmingham and Coventry)            Scotland . Una Healy shows her Irish tadpole brows . Cat Deeley has the Brummie happy brow . Scottish DJ Edith Bowman has plank brows . Southerners are braving the thick ‘South’ brow, which has been adopted by celebs such as Keira Knightley, Lily Collins, Cara Delevingne, Lauren Goodger, Amy Childs, Tamara Ecclestone and even the Duchess of Cambridge. But Debenhams' sales reveal that shoppers int he South prefer a more natural finish to their thicker brows, rather than the very dark brown needed to create the Scouse brow that has been made famous by Liverpool ladies. Indeed, shoppers in the South are buying 93 per cent more natural-toned brow pencils than their Northern counterparts. However, sales of eyebrow wax and darker pencils at the department store are far higher in the Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds branches of the department store as shoppers go for the Scouse brow favoured by England football captain’s wife Alex Gerrard and Coleen Rooney. Irish women prefer a ‘tadpole’ eyebrow - thick and round at the inner corners before going into an immediate thin arch ending with a very thin brow - when they get an in-store beauty appointment. And sales figures show the Emerald Isle sells the least amount of eyebrow products. Meanwhile, women from Birmingham and other West Midlanders shape their brows into an almost half circle shape called the ‘happy’ eyebrow, while serious Scots prefer the ‘plank’ - the straightest of the eyebrow shapes.

Women booking appointments in Wales are requesting the ‘soft arched’ brow - favoured by glamorous Welsh export Catherine Zeta Jones. Sara Stern, beauty director at Debenhams, said: 'The number of women adopting signature brow styles for the region that they live in is so high that it’s like having a brow-o-meter; you can instantly guess what area they are from. 'The Scouse brow is still hugely popular in the north with the likes of Coleen Rooney, but southerners have their own interpretation. 'Instead of the brutal Scouse brow - which is a heavily defined, dark, square and thick penciled eyebrow - Londoners have created their own trend, the 'South brow'. Still opting for big brows, but going for a more natural look, less panto dame. 'Some regions are steering clear of the thicker brows - finding both the Scouse and South brow as terrifying as the vajazzle.

"A 400-year-old haunted house has been put up for a sale - but the £1million price tag could spook some buyers. Henblas house, in the village of Llanasa, north Wales, was built during the English Civil War and is rumoured to boast its own ghostly coach and horses which clatter through the gateway to the house. The Grade I-listed seven-bedroom country mansion was built for a wealthy landowning family during the siege of Chester in 1645. The Grade I-listed Henblas house lays claim to 400 years of history including a ghostly coach and horses which clatter through the gateway to the house . Henblas house lies on the North Wales coast and was built for a wealthy landowning family during the siege of Colchester in 1645 during the English Civil War . The house boasts wood-panelled drawing rooms and dining rooms and extensive formal gardens - with its own country cottage in the garden . The house played a part in both world wars, acting as a prisoner of war camp during the First World War and as an ammunition store and, later, accomodation for evacuees during the Second World War. According to one local historian the house even has links to Welsh freedom fighter Owain Glyndwr - the last . native-born Prince of Wales. Historian Paul Parry said: 'There is a verse in Old Welsh carved on the wall which . reads 'I grew trees round thee to get thee ready for me' and is . attributed to Owain Glyndwr's father. 'He . is buried in the local church and it is believed he could have lived . here in the 14th century in an older building which would have been . demolished with Henblas built on its foundations.'

"The Aviatr plane looks like the drones that fly over Afghanistan - but the $715 million vehicle is designed to fly over Saturn's largest moon, Titan, a body that has fascinated scientists because of its thick, cloudy atmosphere. The Aviatr probe is built to take 3D photos of the surface, to help scientists build up a picture of the planet's geology. At the end of its mission, the 120kg aircraft would dive down to the surface and attempt a landing on Titan's dunes. The $715 million Aviatr probe is an unmanned UAV similar to the probes used over Afghanistan - and the 120kg aircraft would be uniquely well suited to life soaring through the thick atmosphere of Titan . The probe would be equipped with a horizon imaging camera - and would roll in flight to capture full images of cloud banks floating above the planet . Scientists believe that Titan is uniquely suited for heavier-than-air craft - the moon's gravity is relatively low, but its atmosphere is thick, which would mean that a heavier than air craft such as Aviatr could stay airborne for longer. The moon is thickly shrouded in clouds, and scientists are intrigued about what lies beneath. Unlike a balloon - the rival method proposed for missions to Titan - Aviatr would allow scientists to precisely control its altitude, and build up a library of 3D images of the surface and Titan's weather. Titan is bigger than our own Moon and even the planet Mercury. The temperature at Titan's surface is about -178 178 degrees centigrade. The $715m price tag for the mission includes the aircraft plus a rocket and lander to deposit it on the surface of Titan . The project did not make Nasa's most recent round of funding, but Barnes and his colleagues maintain that a heavier than air aircraft is the most realistic method of exploring Titan . The 120kg aircraft will be powered by a generator which creates heat from plutonium-238. When it's sending data back to earth, the aircraft will go into a glide to conserve power . The Aviatr would be much nimbler than a balloon, and would use its plutonium-powered generator to stay on the 'day' side of Titan to make the most of its photographing time. It would go into a glide to save power whenever it was sending images 'back home.' Like earthly aircraft, it would have a 'safe mode' where it would remain steady in Titan's atmosphere when necessary - ensuring it didn't come to harm if its communication link broke. Aviatr would be just 120kg - in Titan's atmosphere, it would be able to glide for long periods . Jason Barnes, a scientist at a University of Idaho designed the concept with a team of 30. Aviatr did not make Nasa's last round of funding - although the $715m price tag includes a delivery system to get it to Titan. Barnes remains hopeful that interest in Aviatr is high, and that he can make the next round of funding. He is insistent that a heavier-than-air craft is the best way to explore the thick atmosphere of Titan - and that a balloon would not do the job.","Plutonium-powered craft weighs just 120kg .

"The man accused of strangling his girlfriend and posting pictures of her dead body on 4Chan, went drinking in a bar just hours after the killing. David Kalac is accused of brutally murdering Amber Lynn Coplin in her home in Port Orchard, Washington, before going on the run and leaving her 13-year-old son to discover the body when he came home from school. The 33-year-old walked into a Portland bar and spent hours chatting to customers and drinking beer and vodka before handing himself over to police in Wilsonville, Oregon, last Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Killer: David Kalac, 33, pictured after his arraignment, visited a bar in Portland and spent hours drinking beer and vodka, shortly after allegedly strangling his girlfriend and posting pictures of her dead body online . Ryan Stowe, owner of The Know bar in Portland, said Kalac drank three cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon and a Vodka with Red Bull. Kalac spent at least four hours drinking in the bar, 'chatting with customers and spilling a beer before leaving a generous tip,' NY Daily News reports. 'It’s weird that he was just hanging out here, knowing police were looking everywhere for him,' Mr Stowe said. 'He wasn’t worried about anyone seeing him or anything.' Following an alleged handwritten confession from Kalac prosecutors have increase the charges from second-degree murder to first-degree murder. Murdered: A coroner's report has found that the injuries on Amber Coplin's body is consistent with manual strangulation, and Kalac has confessed to the killing . Arrest: Kalac, 33, pictured after he handed himself over to police shortly after leaving The Know bar in Portland, has been charged with first-degree murder . Horror: The body of Amber Coplin was discovered by her 13-year-old son and her estranged husband . The new charge includes a domestic violence enhancement and an aggravated circumstance of having 'a destructive and foreseeable impact on persons other than the victim,' said Kitsap County sheriff's spokesman Scott Wilson said . Kalac was arraigned on the charges in Kitsap County Superior Court in Port Orchard, west of Seattle, Friday afternoon. Kalac's lawyer asked to have the plea postponed and his next court date is Friday, November 14, with bail set at $2million. Earlier in the day, the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office filed a probable cause certificate that detailed the new evidence that supported the tougher charges. According to the document, when Kalac emerged from the woods near Portland, Oregon, and surrendered Wednesday, Clackamas County deputies found a note admitting to the crime. It read: 'I killed Amber Coplin. I strangled her with my hands, then a shoelace. Scene: She was found murdered inside her Port Orchard, Washington home, pictured, on Tuesday afternoon - just half an hour after the killer apparently posted grisly images of her naked body online . Sick: Kalac, her boyfriend, also allegedly left messages scrawled inside her bedroom, including 'she killed me first' on a picture and 'dead' across the driving license, which was found near her head . 'I had No reason other than I was Drunk and she pissed me off. Running from the cops was so fun. DK.' The color of the ink and the writing style were consistent with messages authorities say Kalac left at the crime scene, the sheriff's document said. It also quoted from notes authorities say Kalac posted online with the images of Coplin. A quote from one site said: 'Check the news for port orchard Washington in a few hours. Her son will be home from school soon. 'He'll find her, then call the cops. I just wanted to share the pics before they find me.' Another post said that he learned that she was having an affair with another man and that made him angry. The sheriff's document said the Kitsap County coroner's office had determined the cause of death was 'ligature strangulation with blunt force trauma to the head,' and the forensic pathologist said Kalac's hyoid bone, under the chin, was fractured. 'Based on my training and experience this is consistent with manual strangulation,' Detective Chad Birkenfeld said in the document.","David Kalac, 33, visited bar just hours after allegedly killing girlfriend .

"A mass grave found in Dorset contains the bodies of an elite ‘hit squad’ of invading Viking warriors, experts claim. All decapitated and buried alongside their severed heads, the 54 skeletons were discovered in 2009 by workmen digging a road. Archaeologists dated their bones to around the year 1,000 but had few other clues as to the identities of the men who met such a sticky end. Mass grave: The bodies were found by workmen digging a new road and were thought to have been killed during the reign of Aethelred the Unready who ruled from 968 to 1016 . These men, barely into their twenties, were ambushed by the local Anglo-Saxon villagers. Their remains were discovered in 2009 . Now a researcher at Cambridge University claims to have pieced the story together in a documentary to be screened tonight. Dr Britt Baillie’s research suggests they were a fearsome brotherhood of killers who had a strict military code – never to show fear, and never to flee in the face of an enemy unless totally outnumbered. They either were, or modelled themselves on, the Jomsvikings – a hit squad founded by Harald Bluetooth, the Norse king who died around 970 who masterminded a stream of vicious raids on the south coast of England. Named after their stronghold at Jomsborg on the Baltic coast, their history is shrouded in myth but at a time the Vikings were feared across Europe, they were regarded as the most terrifying of all. But on this occasion, the men, barely into their twenties, were ambushed by the local Anglo-Saxon villagers. Piecing it together: Researcher Dr Britt Baillie claims to have finally solved the riddle of why 54 decapitated Viking bodies were found in a mass grave in Dorset in 2009 . Stripped and humiliated, they were rounded up and axes and swords brought down on their necks, before their remains were tossed into a ditch. Dr Baillie believes the murders, at Ridgeway Hill in Dorset, probably took place during the reign of Aethelred the Unready who ruled from 968 to 1016. A chronicle, commissioned by his second wife, Queen Emma notes there was a group of Viking killers in England at the time, led by a fearsome warrior called Thorkel the Tall, said to be a Jomsviking. Research: Dr Baillie says that a chronicle shows that a group of Viking killers were in England at the exact time of the massacre took place . Dr Baillie said: ‘Emma’s record connects Jomsvikings to England at exactly this time. ‘Clearly these men had shown a level of bravery similar to the Jomsviking code. So while we cannot be certain about who they were, there are a number of tie-ins that take us down that route. ‘The legends and stories of the Jomsvikings travelled around the medieval world and would almost certainly have been indicative of some of the practices of other bands of mercenaries or may even have been imitated by other groups.’ Aethelred the Unready was tormented by Vikings and ordered all Danish men living in England to be killed on the November 13, 1002- St Brice’s Day - which became known as the St Brice’s Day massacre. Remains have been found in Oxford and it is thought that massacres also took place in London, Bristol and Gloucester but the remains found here are unique. Unlike the frenzied mob attack that took place at Oxford, all these men were murdered methodically and beheaded in an unusual fashion from the front. This is actually mentioned in Jomsvikings legend which states: ‘I am content to die as are all our comrades. But I will not let myself be slaughtered like a sheep. I would rather face the blow. Strike straight at my face and watch carefully if I pale at all.’ It was discovered last year that the skeletons had stripes filed into their teeth, suggesting this was a way they demonstrated their bravery.","54 skeletons were discovered decapitated and buried alongside their severed heads .

"Fruit smoothies and juices sold as healthy drinks for children can contain 60 per cent more sugar than Coca-Cola, a survey has found. One leading cardiologist said the drinks are so unhealthy that they should be seen as a treat rather than a normal part of a daily diet. A 200ml serving of Coca-Cola contains the equivalent of five teaspoons of sugar. The same amount of some fruit smoothies can contain up to eight. The unhealthy truth: One leading cardiologist said the drinks are so unhealthy that they should be seen as a treat rather than a normal part of a daily diet . A 200ml serving of Coca-Cola contains the equivalent of five teaspoons of sugar, but a 200ml serving of this Sainsbury's Apple & Blackcurrant smoothie (right) contains the equivalent of seven teaspoons of sugar . These include Tesco’s Goodness Slurper smoothies for kids in apple and banana flavour, and Ella’s Kitchen’s The Yellow One Squished Smoothie Fruits, which contains apple, banana, mango and apricots. The products are sold in servings smaller than 200ml, so the sugar hit is reduced. However, health campaigners say the survey results give a good indication of just how much sugar they contain. The research by Action on Sugar found that more than a quarter of drinks – 57 of the 203 – contain at least as much sugar as Coca-Cola. And a quarter of all the drinks contained sugar or glucose-fructose syrup as an added ingredient. The campaigning group warned that high-sugar drinks are fuelling obesity. At the same time tooth decay is the most common reason for children in England being admitted to hospital. When a whole fruit is processed into a drink, the sugars in the cell walls are released as ‘free sugars’ which damage the teeth, while the absence of fibre means you take in more calories. Chairman of Action on Sugar, Professor Graham MacGregor, said: ‘It is a complete scandal that these drinks are marketed to children and parents as if they are “healthy”. This has to stop.’ Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist and science director of the group, added: ‘Fruit juice and smoothies should not be part of a healthy, balanced diet. ‘There is increasing scientific evidence that regular sugary drink consumption is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, independent of body weight.’ Gavin Partington, of the British Soft Drinks Association, said: ‘It is unfortunate this survey omits to mention the established health benefits of fruit juice, such as vitamin C.’","A 200ml serving of Coca-Cola contains equivalent of five teaspoons of sugar .

"Tory welfare minister Lord Freud said he could not understand why people go to food banks . A Tory welfare minister is under fire for claiming it is ‘very hard to know why’ people go to food banks. Lord Freud said nobody turned to charities for food parcels ‘willingly’ but could not understand what made them need help to feed their families. Campaigners blame benefits cuts and the impact of the economic crisis for a sharp rise in the number of people using food banks in recent years. More than half a million people across Britain have turned to food banks to stave off hunger, according to charities. Ministers have previously argued that a surge in demand has in part been fuelled by jobcentre staff being allowed to refer the unemployed to food banks for help. Cuts to benefits, frozen or falling wages and rising living costs have been blamed in part for some people struggling to make ends meet. During a debate in the House of Lords, peers heard how changes to the welfare system meant more families were turning to food banks. Labour’s Baroness Lister of Burtersett urged the government to estimate the ‘cost to family relationships of cuts to social security, which are forcing some families to move, breaking up their family and social relationships, and the cost to them of ever increasing punitive sanctions, which are driving more and more families to food banks’. She added: ‘Both these trends are leaving families under more and more stress, leading, potentially, to the break-up of relationships.’ But Lord Freud said the rise in demand for food banks was difficult to understand. ‘Clearly nobody goes to a food bank willingly,’ he said. ‘However, it is very hard to know why people go to them.’ Charities argue that cuts to benefits and increasing use of sanctions mean more people have had to turn to food banks to feed their families . He pointed to a recent report by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which showed there was a lack of systematic peer-reviewed research from the UK on the reasons or immediate circumstances that lead people to turn to food aid. But Chris Mould, chairman of the Trussell Trust which runs 420 food banks, told the People: ‘I'm mystified by his remarks. We've kept statistics for the 14 years we've run food banks. ‘This gives a powerful answer why people are in need of them. It's related to benefit changes and low incomes.’ The Trussell Trust says 347,000 people used its food banks in December, compared with 26,000 a month five years ago. Last year Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove sparked outrage when he claimed families become so poor they are forced to turn to food banks because of their own ‘decisions’, . He suggested that many cash-strapped families have brought their problems on themselves. He added: ‘I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures.‘Those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances. ‘We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.’","Lord Freud challenged about the impact of benefits changes on families .

"As far as Douglas Pidgeon was concerned, he was only returning his neighbour’s property to its rightful place. But when he scooped up a deposit left on his lawn by next door’s cat Oscar and hurled it over the garden fence, he cannot have imagined the nightmare it would trigger. First there was a doorstep confrontation with neighbour Matthew Lucas who claimed there had been more than one missile and pointed out forcefully that one of them had come to rest on his garden table. Fight: Matthew Lucas, pictured left leaving Chippenham Magistrate's Court, fought with Douglas Pidgeon, right, after Mr Pidgeon threw poo from Mr Lucas's cat into the latter's garden, where his daughter found it . Battleground: Mr Pidgeon, who lives at the house on the right, was fed up with the cat belonging to Mr Lucas, who lives on the left, fouling his lawn . Then . the showdown became physical. Blood was drawn as the two men wrestled . outside their £250,000 homes in Chippenham, Wiltshire, and ‘clashed . heads’. Finally, it ended in court, with Mr Pidgeon, 60, facing a charge of assault. He was cleared after a day-long trial this week. The father of two told magistrates: ‘The cat comes in and uses the garden as a toilet. ‘I went out to cut the grass and I scooped it up and lobbed it over the fence. I didn’t think anything more about it. ‘I . know it was their cat. I just threw it – that was it. I didn’t really . think about it to be honest. I agree the sensible thing to do would have . been to go and speak to the owners. I have never spoken to them about . it.’ He admitted throwing . the poo back over the fence was ‘not the appropriate thing to do’ and . ‘quite irrational’, but added: ‘I didn’t expect anyone to come round at . all to be honest. I was quite shocked when he did come to my door.’ The . fight between Mr Pidgeon and Matthew Lucas, 38, was eventually broken . up by Mr Lucas’s wife Karen, who lodged a complaint with police. She . alleged that 5ft 7in Mr Pidgeon had head-butted her 6ft 4in husband. But the 60-year-old was cleared of any wrongdoing after magistrates . failed to agree that the clash of heads was deliberate. Drama: Chippenham Magistrates court heard how the fight was broken up by Mr Lucas's wfie . The court heard how the dispute escalated on August 5 last year when Mr Lucas returned to his home with his two children. When . he opened the patio doors to allow them to play in the garden his . five-year-old daughter discovered it was littered with cat poo. Mr . Lucas cleared up the mess but did not confront his neighbour until his . wife came home two hours later. Mrs Lucas, 37, said: ‘I came home and my . husband said my daughter had witnessed what she thought was mud on the . garden table. ‘He said he . went out to the garden and looked at it and realised it was cat faeces . covered in grass, and realised it must have been thrown on to our table. ‘He was not aggressive, he was quite shocked and surprised by the situation.’ She . said she urged her husband to speak to their neighbour because if their . daughter ‘had touched this it could have blinded her’. ‘Mr Pidgeon . admitted it straight away,’ Mrs Lucas told Chippenham magistrates’ court. ‘He said, “Yes, I did throw the cat poo over the hedge. I  am fed . up of the cat coming in my garden”.’ Both . men claimed to have been ‘speaking normally’ when the confrontation . began and each blamed one another for starting the fight. Mr Pidgeon alleged his neighbour prodded him forcefully in the chest before starting to ‘grapple’ with him on the doorstep. Mr . Lucas claimed the 60-year-old head-butted him as soon as he raised the . issue of the cat faeces, causing him to restrain his neighbour through . fear of another attack. The court heard they smashed heads, slicing the skin on the bridge of Mr Lucas’s nose and injuring Mr Pidgeon’s forehead. Magistrates . cleared Mr Pidgeon of assault by beating after a trial on Monday. Roger . Coleman, chairman of the bench, said: ‘We find any contact of heads was . accidental in the course of the struggle that occurred between the . parties.’ Last night Mrs . Lucas said the family had not let three-year-old Oscar out since the . incident. Another neighbour said ‘nearly everyone else in the street’ except Mr Pidgeon has cats.","Douglas Pidgeon, 60, threw poo from Matthew Lucas's cat into his garden .

"The children of the late billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife have claimed that trustees allowed him to drain their $210 million trust to prop up his struggling newspaper, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Jennie Scaife, 51, and her brother David Scaife, 48, said in court documents filed in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania last week that they were told at least $90 million would be left to them. But when the Scaifes - who were also left nothing in their father's will - checked the trust's balance after his death on July 4 this year, they learned that it was completely empty. In court documents, they accuse his three trustees of allowing their banking and oil heir father to use the trust as 'his own personal bank account' and to cover the  Tribune-Review's losses, even though it was their duty to preserve funds for them, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. Emptied trust funds: Richard Mellon Scaife, the owner of the Tribune Review newspapers who died in July, used millions of dollars from his children's trust to keep the publications afloat, they have claimed . They are demanding an accounting of spending and a hearing is scheduled in the case for December 17. He left nothing to the pair in his will, which split the funds of his other trusts - estimated to be in the billion-dollar range - between his two foundations, the Sarah Scaife Foundation and the Allegheny Foundation. The trust in dispute was the only one that did not give him full control over how the assets were used. It was set up in 1935 by their grandmother, Sarah Mellon Scaife, who said that it should be used for his 'welfare' but that any amount left over should go to his 'issue'. If he did wish to use it, the trustees were expected to weigh up his interest with the interests of his children, the Post-Gazette reported. Broken promises: Scaife's son David Scaife, pictured left, said in his petition that he was told he and his sister Jennie Scaife, pictured right, would be left at least $90 million in the trust . From 2000 to 2004, Scaife took $130 million for the Tribune-Review and much of that sum came from the trust, according to the petitions. Then in 2002, he took out $19.5 million from the trust and then in 2004, he took out $18 million. They claim that in 2005 the trust contained $210 million and by the end of 2007, its balance was $140 million. David Scaife's petition says that the trustees assured him in 2008 that other funds were being used for the newspaper, and that there would be $90 million left for him and his sister. Attorneys told the Post-Gazette that if a trust is usually significantly emptied, the children might be asked to sign a waiver allowing it - but this did not happen in this case. In his petition, David Scaife called the newspaper as 'a waste of trust assets'. Family fortune: Sarah Mellon Scaife, pictured in 1955, set up the trust fund in 1935 and intended for it to be passed down to her son's children, they claim in their petitions which were filed last week . Michael J. Hussey, an associate professor of law at Widener University in Chester, who is not involved in the case, said that they might have a cause of action. He said they could seek to recover the money from their father's estate that they think should have saved for them. The executor of Scaife's estate, Yale N. Gutnick, disputes the children's claims. Gutnick is one of the trustees, along with Scaife cousin James M. Walton and PNC Bank. They will now have to convince the judge that they should not have to detail the trust's spending.","Jennie Scaife, 51, and her brother David Scaife, 48, claim that trustees let their father use their trust to keep the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review afloat .

"Kabir Ahmed spoke of how life under ISIS was 'fun' in an interview aired on BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat . Radio 1 has fallen under scrutiny for airing an interview with an ISIS suicide bomber who boasted that fighting jihad in the Middle East was more fun than video games. The station broadcast an interview with Kabir Ahmed on June 13, three days before the organisation became a proscribed terrorist group in the UK. Ahmed, who used the name Abu Sumayyah in Syria, is thought to have killed himself and 11 police officers after detonating a bomb in Baaji, northern Iraq, on Friday. In the interview, the jihadi tells journalists he walked around carrying a Kalashnikob automatic weapon and a rocket propelled grenade launcher. 'It's actually quite fun, better than, how you would say what's that game called, Call of Duty? It's like that, but you know, 3d, you know. 'You can see everything's happening in front of you, you know, it's real, you know what I mean?' he said, adding he enjoyed 'freedom' and 'the good life'. Broadcasting regulator Ofcom and the BBC Trust have ruled that the interview, believed to have been recorded near Ahmed's training camp in northern Syria, fell foul of regulations as his positive descriptions of ISIS were unchallenged. A spokesman for the watchdog said: 'Ofcom’s rules require broadcasters to protect audiences, and in particular children, from harmful and offensive content. 'After a thorough investigation, Ofcom found the BBC breached rules by failing to challenge the positive descriptions an Isis fighter provided of his experiences in an interview.' The BBC Trust said its failure to challenge views that were aired and to include sufficient context amounted to a breach of impartiality rules. 'Newsbeat accepts the findings of the Ofcom report - appropriate measures have already been introduced to prevent similar breaches in the future,' a spokesman said. Ahmed, pictured with Iraqi children, fled the UK after being released from prison. The 30-year-old spent time in Syria before travelling to Iraq where he is thought to have killed himself . Ahmed is thought to have killed himself and 11 policemen by driving a truckload of explosives into a group of Shi'ite Muslims. His family this weekend spoke of their horror, adding they felt he should not have been allowed through airport security to travel to Syria as he was allegedly known to authorities. ‘He just left us and everybody knows we don’t have contact with him and we haven’t tried to contact him,’ a woman at his house said of the jihadi. Former care worker and father-of-three Kabir Ahmed, 30, said he was prepared to sacrifice his own children 'a hundred times for Allah' in his last known interview before driving an explosives-laden truck into an Iraqi police convoy. The fundamentalist, who was jailed in 2012 after handing out homophobic propaganda calling for gay people to face the death penalty in Britain, had fled his family home and country to join jihadis in Syria. After serving his sentence, Ahmed abandoned his wife Nashira Arif, 28, and their three children 16 months ago to join Islamic group Jund al-Sham in Syria before switching his allegiance to IS. It was also well known before he left the country that Ahmed had links to Anjem Choudary and the banned British terrorist organisation al-Muhajiroun. In one interview available online, the jihadi said he was ‘craving martyrdom’. He is thought to have killed himself and 11 policeman in Beiji, a city north of Baghdad, on Friday.","Kabir Ahmed was interviewed for Newsbeat programme in Syria in June .

"While it may seem like common sense to most passengers, some travellers find it acceptable to act in a manner than others could find annoying. Former flight attendant Shawn Kathleen - who set up a Passenger Shaming website - has revealed the most outrageous habits by flyers in the air. From clipping finger and toe nails and changing a baby's nappy, to wandering around without socks and even having sex - Kathleen labels the behaviour 'disrespectful'. Top complaint: Passengers who remove their shoes during a flight are the number one annoyance . Passenger Shaming: An image shared on Shawn Kathleen's website reveals badly behaved travellers . 1. Going barefoot . Then it comes to hygiene alone, one of the most common offences is people taking off their shoes on a plane - and Shawn (not her real name) counts as her top worst passenger behaviours. 'It's an epidemic,' she tells Yahoo Travel. 'It's disrespectful and it's disgusting.' Shawn reveals that nail clipping is an unfortunately all-too-common occurrence on planes . 2. Nail clipping . A plane is simply no place to clip your nails or to give yourself a pedicure or manicure - however, this is exactly what Kathleen says she's seen happening in the air. 'I once had a passenger treating his warts with Compound W on a flight!' Shawn said. 'You're not in your living room, this is a public airplane!' Some parents opt to change their baby's dirty diaper on the seat beside them or the tray table in front . 3. Changing dirty nappies . The smell alone would be enough to alienate anyone in close quarters populated by recirculated air - but changing a baby's diaper on the tray table in front of you? Yes, it really happens. '[The tables] don't get wiped down after every flight,' Shawn revealed. Fellow former flight attendant and etiquette expert Jacqueline Whitmore added: 'Parents should use the lavatory to change their baby's diaper.' One of the most frequent passenger complaints is about others who eat odorous foods aboard . 4. Eating smelly food . It's a frequent complaint, but so long as you're not leaving your lunch remains littered across the floor of the aircraft, is this really so offensive? Yahoo Food Editor Julia Bainbridge disagrees. 'In confined places, each of us has an obligation to limit offensive odours that might be offensive to others,' she said. 'You are not at home - save the anchovies for a time when you are.' Mile High Club: Shawn revealed that as long as passengers were quick, she generally didn't bother them . 5. Sex on a plane . One of the most infamous photos on Passenger Shaming may be of an unwrapped condom found under a seat. 'Sometimes things happen in a dark cabin that's attempted under a blanket,' Kathleen said, admitting that she'd usually quickly put a stop to that sort of behaviour when she was a flight attendant. And those passengers looking to sneak into the lavatories and join the Mile High Club? 'I don't care,' she said. 'As long as they're not bothering anybody, I'm like ""I don't see anything"".' The take home point? 'Always be aware of your surroundings,' Shawn says . Passenger Shaming was set up in January 2013 to highlight some of the less than desirable habits some have adopted while flying. The photos, which are submitted anonymously by passengers and flight attendants, are posted to Facebook and Instagram and the results are sure to shock. There's people resting their feet near people's head and on tray tables, as well as people sleeping with their feet in awkward positions. But then there's photos of people changing children's nappies on tray tables and remarkably leaving them on the floor or in the back seat pocket when they disembark.

"Barack Obama has attempted to create better ties with the U.S. and China by signing a new visa agreement for each other's citizens. Visitors to both countries will be able to stay for up to 10 years rather than one under a negotiation by the president, announced at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Beijing today. But there are fears Obama's powers are beginning to wane on the global stage as well as at home after the Democrats lost the power of the Senate during last week's mid-term elections. Scroll down for video . Barack Obama announced a change to visas at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bejing today . The defeat could affect his position in talks with China as media sources report he is seen as a 'diminished leader on the world stage in his last two years of presidency'. He put on a bright face as he addressed business leaders at today's summit where he set out to dispel the notion that America's interest in Asia should be a cause of concern for China's leaders. Beijing has viewed Obama's engagement with trepidation out of concern the U.S. wants to limit China's rise, but Obama insisted that 'one country's prosperity doesn't have to come at the expense of the other.' 'We want China to do well,' Obama said. 'We compete for business, but we also seek to cooperate on a broad range of challenges and shared opportunities.' Under the visa agreement, due to be issued on Wednesday, U.S. and Chinese citizens will be able to obtain business and short-term tourist visas valid for 10 years, up from one year currently. Student and cultural exchange visas will be made valid for five years rather than just one year, Obama said.

Obama has faced fresh criticism over his waning power after the Democrats lost the power of the Senate during last week's mid-term elections . The negotiation will allow citizens to U.S. and China to keep the same visa for 10 years rather than just one with the White House hoping it will bring extra extra money in for the economy . Coming just hours after the president's arrival in Beijing - the first stop on his week-long trip to China, Myanmar and Australia, the announcement offered him an opportunity to portray the U.S. and China as working in good faith. However the new visa plans may have only modest implications as it does not increase how long an American can remain in China or vice-versa. Rather, it increases the length of time during which a visitor is permitted to enter the country - so a Chinese citizen who visits the U.S. every few years would be able to use the same visa for a decade, rather than having to reapply for a new visa every year. Obama puts on a cheery front as he addresses business leaders at the event, which is part of a week-long tour . He set out to dispel the notion that America's interest in Asia should be a cause of concern for China's leaders . Barack Obama meets with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott today. He will also travel to Myanmar and Australia during his week-long trip to the region . The U.S. hopes the deal will lure more Chinese travellers to the U.S. - and with it, billions of dollars into the economy. The White House said it could drive up demand that would create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the U.S., without sacrificing national security. About 100 million Chinese travelled last year, but less than 2 percent of those visited the U.S. But the announcement was set against a backdrop of doubt as critics say his support at home is diminishing. The Chinese Global Times says that 'US society has grown tired of his banality' and claims Obama 'has done an insipid job, offering nearly nothing to his supporters'. At the same time, other signs pointed to a heightened sense of competition that have rankled relations between the world's two largest economies. Obama stepped off Air Force One and onto a red carpet, where the honor guard lined his path to a limousine . The Chinese guardsmen form perfect lines waiting for Obama to step off the plane when he arrived today . China is the opening stop of Obama's three-country tour that will test the president's ability to play a commanding role on the world stage during his final two years in office . Only hours earlier, Obama was at the U.S. Embassy hosting heads of state from the 11 other countries — excluding China — that are pursuing a long-delayed trade pact. Finalising the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a cornerstone of Obama's much-touted effort to expand U.S. influence and economic presence in Asia, but China has responded by pushing its own regional trade deal with many of the same nations. U.S. officials said Obama would have further agreements with China to announce later during his three-day visit when he meets with President Xi Jinping, and the two leaders have common cause when it comes to combating climate change. But thornier issues were also on the agenda for Obama's meetings in China, including cybersecurity and China's aggressive posture toward its neighbors.","Barack Obama is on a week-long visit of region and arrived in China today .

"The key with breastfeeding seems to be to stick with it six months or so to see any benefit in terms of weight loss . Looking at pictures of Kate Middleton playing volleyball at Olympic Park, just 89 days after Prince George’s birth was truly mind blowing.  Her flat stomach was proudly on display in her J Brand skinny jeans and 4-inch heeled wedges – this was a woman who knew she looked incredible. So just how did she do it? Well, according to US weekly, sources insist her weight loss has not been intentional. 'Kate's hardly done anything to lose the weight….(she’s) still breastfeeding and the small weight she gained while pregnant has just melted off. A few weeks after George was born, you could hardly tell she had just given birth.' Breastfeeding – the magic bullet of weight loss. Just breast feed and the weight will melt away. But is it really true? Or merely part of a world-wide, government supported conspiracy to get women to adhere to the adage that breast is best? As I limped out of Chelsea Westminister Hospital after giving birth, I can vividly recall the encouraging words of my midwife, ‘yes, you’ve got a bit of a tum, but with breast feeding you will lose that right away.’ Waddling home, two sizes bigger than I had ever been before, that statement was a great comfort in the weeks ahead. Indeed, it became my mantra – repeated on a loop in my mind every time I caught unintentional glimpses of my new form in the mirror. Indeed, I had high hopes for the power of breast feeding, having heard legendary tales of weight dropping off due to the power of the calorie-burning bosom.  I kept hearing again and again; ‘Breastfeeding is a super work out. It burns between 500-700 calories per day.’ I thought for once in my life, there would be a simple and easy solution to dropping pounds: God’s reward for feeding my baby the natural way. Supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio openly attributed her postpartum slim-down to Pilates, spinning, surfing, and breastfeeding.  And celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson, whose clients include Gwyneth Paltrow and Kim Kardashian says, that when it comes to dropping baby weight, 'My number one thing is that I’m a big breastfeeding advocate.' Heidi Klum, who lost 30lbs in six months after her pregnancy, credited breastfeeding for her rapid post-natal weight loss (that and taking nude pictures of herself every week to track her body changing). Um, not happening, like ever. The Duchess of Cambridge showed off an incredibly flat stomach just weeks after giving birth to her first  child, leading many to question how she had managed to shed the weight . In any case, I certainly had a lot of reasons to be optimistic. However, despite going on a healthy diet, the weight was really sticking. I felt like a walrus laying down fat for winter. I started to ask other mums and baby experts about whether or not breastfeeding is indeed the golden ticket to weight loss that they’d hoped for – and the results were somewhat surprising. Dr Marilyn Glenville PhD (www.marilynglenville.com) is one of the UK’s leading nutritionists specialising in women’s health.  She tells me, ‘In theory, breastfeeding does burn calories (about 750 extra calories a day) but not everyone reacts the same way.  The extra weight you put on in pregnancy can be used to produce breast milk and the weight loss can be more noticeable if you breastfeed for longer than three months.' And as for my personal experience she says, 'Your story is not unusual in that some women do not experience weight loss and their appetite can increase during breastfeeding making them gain more weight. The evidence seems to show that the longer you breastfeed the better the weight loss. Alessandra Ambrosio openly attributed her postpartum slim-down to Pilates, spinning, surfing, and breast-feeding . 'The weight loss seems to take effect between three to six months after the birth as your body uses more of your fat stores and your appetite can decrease at this point as the baby is having less feeds.’ I reached out to the lactation experts Medela – the makers of the world’s most popular breast pump, figuring they had a vested interest in this. They said, ‘Plenty of research shows that breastfeeding certainly does support weight loss, however the key is that it is not always within the first few weeks as people hope for. In the first few months very little will happen as the body is trying to figure out how to cope with supply and demand, and how much energy expenditure they will invest in their milk supply. They backed these claims up with several academic studies, including one that measured the weight loss of breastfeeders vs. formula feeders. They found greater weight loss in breastfeeding women (a loss of 4.4 kg vs 2.4 kg), but this was mainly lost between three and six months.’ Their conclusion was that 'lactation enhances weight loss postpartum if breastfeeding continues for at least 6 months.’ So the key seems to be, you have to stick with it six months or so to see any benefit in terms of weight loss. However, that statistic must also be balanced with the fact that for some women, you can’t lose all your baby weight until you actually stop. In fact, several experts agreed that breast feeding can slow you weight loss down at the end. Tanya Zuckerbrot, author of The F-Factor Diet says, 'A lot of women say it helps with a lot of the weight up front, but the last 10 pounds, if you’re breast-feeding, are very hard to lose.' Jane Munro a midwife and professional advisor to the Royal College of Midwives says she’s not sure where all these breast feeding/weight loss promises originated. ‘There are definitive reasons as to why breast feeding is the best option for babies. However, as for breast feeding leading to weight loss, there isn’t real evidence behind it. No one has proven a strong association between breast feeding and weight loss. I think some women have found that to be their experience and have told other women about it – but there isn’t really the academic evidence to prove it one way or the other.’ As for the assurance I’d had from my own mid-wife Jane added, ‘Some midwives might suggest that it helps you lose weight, but we certainly don’t put any recommendations out about that. It’s entirely possible that midwives hear this from some of the women they look after and therefore this can end up being part of the midwife’s conversation from that point on.’ Supermodel Heidi Klum poses on the runway during the Victoria's Secret Fashion show in New York, just 2 months after giving birth to her second child . Nutritionist Zoe Harcombe, author of the bestselling Harcombe Diet (which is suitable for breast feeding women), scoffs at the claims that breast feeding is the key to weight loss. She says, ‘There was an academic study of 315 women in Brazil over two years. The average weight loss at six months was 2.5kg, 3kg at 12 months (i.e. only a further 1/2 kg in six months) and only 1.9kg at 18 months (i.e. a slight regain). That’s a 0.077kg difference at 24 months. That's 77 grams! That's like taking your rings off and cutting your toe nails before weighing!’ She adds, ‘The majority of studies reported little or no association between breastfeeding and weight change, Breastfeeding is without a doubt the single best nutritional start you can give your baby – and that's the best reason to do it!' Ultimately it would be ridiculous to base your decision of whether or not to breastfeed based on whether or not it helps with weight loss. After all, there are far more important factors to consider and at this stage in the game, it’s not really all about you. Having said that, I wish I had known this beforehand; I might have said no to a pizza or two. Indeed, whilst breastfeeding may not be the golden ticket I was hoping for, I’m not giving up. Chubster or no, I know it’s good for my baby girl, who clearly loves it. In fact, I’ve just ordered a brand new, hands free, double action breast pump, known as the ‘the Rolls-Royce’ of breast pumps. Why? Because she’s worth it.

Mr Ashley said one of his daughters wanted to kiss a squirrel while the other wanted to take them home . The family have been returning to the tree to see whether they can spot the squirrels again. Mr Ashley said: 'They were hugging, it was absolutely adorable. 'The squirrels are obviously quite young, because their mum was sat on a branch higher up, keeping an eye on them. 'We decided to name them Pinky and Perky because you can really see their red eyes against their white fur.' While the family were watching the squirrel show, one of the albino rodents decided to go for a run across the grass . Pinky and Perky face an uncertain future as their bright coats mean they are highly visible to predators . Unfortunately, Pinky and Perky's future looks quite bleak as their unusual colour means they can be easily spotted by predators. Squirrels have about a one in 100,000 chance of being born albinism. As well as the white hair and white skin, albino squirrels have red eyes. They also suffer from vision problems. Ordinarily, squirrels remain with their mothers until they reach about four months old before making their own way into the wild. Earlier this month, Lady Sarah Gough, 75, thought she’d seen a ghost when she heard mysterious scratching at a window in her home in Sevenoaks, Kent, only to discover it was an albino squirrel.","The rare albino squirrels were spotted in a park in Waterlooville, Hampshire .

"Rifleman Harry Brown's mother was told he was presumed dead when he was actually in a war camp . A heartbreaking tale of a soldier whose family were told he was presumed dead even though he was alive in a German prisoner of war camp has been revealed. But sadly, even though rifleman Harry Brown survived to see the end of the war, he never made it home. Just 16 days after the armistice was signed on November 11 in 1918, he had died of an inflammation of the lungs. Harry, who served in the 2nd Kings Royal Rifle Corps regiment, set off for France in 1917. His mother wrote to Harry on July 12, 1917 – but had her letter returned with the code ‘Missing 10-7-17’ written on the envelope. She immediately wrote to the Red Cross asking for information and received a reply on July 30 promising that enquiries were being made. But in August, she received a standard letter sent via the Red Cross to relatives of a number of soldiers who were missing and presumed killed in action after a battle at Nieuport les Bains on July 10, 1917. The letter, with Harry Brown’s name added in the right place, was sent to his mother on August 15 . But in fact, Harry had been captured not killed – and wrote to his mother from the German war camp in Linburg-on-Lahn reassuring Mrs Brown of his good health. The postcard dated August 31, 1917, said: ‘Dear Mother, I am in good health and if you send to the address below, it will find me.’ He added: ‘Don’t worry about me as I have finished with the war.’ Harry was later moved to another camp in Bayreuth but even though he survived until the war had ended, he died on November 27 in 1919. A letter sent to Mrs Brown, in Eastbourne, East Sussex, gave her the news that her son had died. Simon Feldman, of the Royal Mail, said the postal service played a vital role in the war. Mrs Brown was told her son was presumed dead, only to receive a postcard later to say he was 'in good health' Harry wrote to his mother from the war camp in August 1917 to say he was 'finished with the war' He said: ‘With letters being the only means of connecting loved ones, acting as a real lifeline during the conflict. ‘Through these letters and postcards we can see the terrible danger soldiers faced on the front line during the First World, as well as the anxiety, worry and grief felt by families left behind at home. ‘The correspondence to Harry Brown’s mother provides a sad insight into the moment all families would have dreaded; a letter to say her son was missing, presumed dead. ‘Mrs Brown’s later joy at receiving a postcard from her captured son would have sadly been short lived, as Harry died just 16 days after the Armistice was signed in 1918.’ In December 1914, a special sorting office – the Home Depot – was built to deal with mail sent to the troops. In 1917, more than 19,000 mailbags crossed the channel each day with half a million bags conveyed in the run up to Christmas. Mrs Brown had written to the Red Cross after a letter had been returned with 'Missing' written on the envelope . Sadly, Harry never made it home after the war and Mrs Brown received this letter informing her that he had died from inflammation of the lungs .","Harry Brown, of the 2nd Kings Royal Rifle Regiment, set off for war in 1917 .

"Australia's biggest mosque has sparked outrage with a 'fatwa' post on its Facebook page warning Muslims it is a 'sin' to wish people a merry Christmas. The message has been removed from the Lakemba Mosque page of the social networking website after being condemned by Muslim leaders. It followed a controversial lecture at the Sydney mosque at Friday prayer, when head imam Sheikh Yahya Safi reportedly told worshipers not to have anything to do with Christmas. Outrage: A post on Lakemba Mosque's Facebook page warned celebrating Christmas was a sin . Officials at the mosque said the online . post was put up by a youth worker who had copied the text of a fatwa - a . religious ruling - from another Islamic website.

"Missing: Len King, 74, went sailing yesterday on his 70ft yacht but failed to return to Brighton Marina . The wife of a 74-year-old businessman who remains missing from his luxury yacht has begged for his safe return as the Coastguard called off a major search. Len King sailed his 70ft Sunseeker out of Brighton Marina yesterday and said he would be back for dinner with his wife Stephanie, 65, with whom he has run an engineering firm for more than 20 years. But he failed to return, and a friend who saw the £750,000 vessel drifting empty by the harbour wall raised the alarm just before 10pm. Coastguard crews, lifeboats and a helicopter mounted a massive all-night search which took them as far as two and a half miles into the English Channel. They continued searching despite a thunderstorm which forced the helicopter to turn back until they were stood down just after 11am today. Despite the search being suspended Mr King, from Alfriston, East Sussex, is still missing and his wife has made an emotional public appeal for his whereabouts. She said she had tried to call him several times but could not get through to his phone. 'Len is an experienced yachtman and has been sailing since he was at least 20,' she added. 'Normally we go together but during the week if it's calm weather he may go off by himself. 'He went off just before lunch. I was expecting him home for dinner time. 'I phoned him several times but his phone was unable to connect so I thought he was on his way back. I called the person who has a boat next to us and he thought we were away. 'I can't understand what has happened. He is a very experienced yachtman. He has all his equipment doubled up and is always careful. That is the way he runs things.' The pair run a successful precision engineering firm in Eastbourne, East Sussex, supplying specialist parts for medical, mining and aerospace machines. Mr King is believed to have taken his luxury vessel sailing yesterday between Brighton and Newhaven, East Sussex,  the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said. Brighton RNLI said fears grew when a crew member boarded the Sunseeker, found drifting on the inside of the eastern breakwater of Brighton Marina, and found no one on board. That was despite the fact the instruments were still on and the engines were still warm. Mystery: The Coastguard has called off a massive sea search operation for a yachtsman Len King, whose 70ft Sunseeker was found drifting in Brighton Marina (pictured). But he remains missing and his fate is unknown . Mystery: RNLI crews surround the yacht this morning after carrying out an all-night search in the Channel . The Coastguard said lifeboats searched 'in and out of every pontoon', the stretch of water between Newhaven and Shoreham, West Sussex, and as far out as 2.5 miles offshore. Crews were stood down briefly at 5.30am but relaunched at 7am as it was getting light, the RNLI said. Roger Cohen, Brighton RNLI lifeboat operations manager, said conditions for the volunteers overnight were 'challenging'. 'We had heavy rain with passing thunderstorms and fork lighting in Sussex throughout the night, making things even more challenging than they would normally be,' he added. 'At the moment this is something of a mystery - the Sunseeker was found within the eastern breakwater of the marina, banging up against the wall. 'When my crew boarded they found evidence it had recently been operated, but no sign of anyone. Decision: A Coastguard spokesman said the search would be stood down unless there was further evidence . Brighton RNLI operations manager Roger Cohen (not pictured) added: 'We found no sign of anyone. Judging by the instruments and passage plans we found, the yachtsman appears to be skilled and experienced' 'Judging by the instruments and passage plans we found, the yachtsman appears to be skilled and experienced.'

Inspector Roy Apps of Sussex Police said: 'It is an anxious time for the family. 'The search is currently suspended and we are liaising with his family as we investigate the circumstances of his disappearance.

"Treasury officials harbour ‘grave doubts’ over whether George Osborne will be able to deliver promised tax cuts after the next election because of the state of the public finances, it was claimed yesterday. An analysis suggested the Chancellor will have to cut £48billion in the next five years to meet his austerity targets, twice the level previously thought necessary. If the Tories continue to protect spending on the NHS, schools and foreign aid, other areas of spending – including welfare, the police, local government, environment, justice and defence – will have to take a third out of their budgets, it suggested. Mr Osborne has insisted that £25billion is needed to eradicate the deficit, promising to raise it all from public spending cuts. Between 2015-16 and 2018-19 public spending will have to fall by £48billion, with the axe falling on unprotected departments like welfare, defence and police . An analysis by the Financial Times suggests only half of the reductions have yet been found. When the coalition was formed in 2010, Mr Osborne promised to balance the books with five years. The new research suggests that the promise to save £25billion over the next five years will not be enough to get Britain out of the red. Between 2015-16 and 2018-19 public spending will have to fall by £48billion. The figure has prompted doubts inside the Treasury over whether the Tories’ promise of big tax cuts will be achievable. In total, the tax cuts will cost around £7billion. However, the research suggests Mr Osborne’s commitment to save a further £25billion over the next five years will not be enough. Using data from the Office for Budget Responsibility on spending up to 2018-19, the analysis found that an extra £48.7billion in spending reductions is needed. Total public spending will fall from £312billion in 2014-15 to £264billion in 2018-19. Chancellor George Osborne has pledged to raise £12billion in new benefit cuts for people of working age . It means unprotected departments face cuts of 33 per cent over the next five years, compared to 21 per cent since 2009-10. Total public spending in unprotected areas will fall from £144billion to £96billion, the research suggested. A Treasury source said: ‘There are obviously different ways of presenting things to get different numbers, but we have always been clear there are tough decisions to be taken. We have clearly shown over this parliament that we have been able to get a grip on public spending while at the same time cutting taxes for hardworking people.’ It raises doubts about the Tories' promise of major tax cuts after the election. David Cameron announced plans to increase the amount workers can earn before paying tax to £12,500, and increase the 40p rate threshold to £50,000. But the tax package is expected to cost £7billion in total. Mr Cameron has also promised real terms increase in NHS spending, while schools and international development spending will also escape the axe. It means that unprotected departments face cuts of 33 per cent over the next five years, compared to 21 per cent since 2009-10. General Sir Nicholas Houghton (pictured left) confirmed yesterday that Prime Minister David Cameron (right) does not want to cut further the number of troops in Britain's 82,000-strong armed force . It means total public in unprotected areas will fall from £144billion to £96billion, the FT said. Mr Osborne wants to raise £12billion in a new round of cuts to benefits for people of working age. But other big spending areas will still face swinging cuts. Britain's top military officer yesterday warned against further cuts to the armed forces. Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton said that David Cameron does not want to reduce the number of troops in Britain's 82,000-strong armed forces. 'I know the Prime Minister does not want again to cut the physical manpower of the armed forces. But there is of course still further fiscal consolidation to face,’ he said. The Prime Minister has said repeatedly that he does not wants further reductions to the size of the Armed Forces, and suggested the UK should spend at least two per cent of its national income. However, areas of the Ministry of Defence budget are likely to come under pressure in a new round of spending cuts after the general election, whoever is in power. Sir Nicholas also told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme there had been some 'early glitches' in the attempt to recruit 30,000 Army reservists to plug the gap left by cuts to regular troops. Sir Nicholas said: '30,000 by 2018 was always going to be quite a tall order, and there have been some early glitches in that campaign to recruit those.'

"Undeterred: Aerosol attack victim Callum Watkins, 15, laid a wreath for Remembrance Sunday . This is the 15-year-old poppy seller who refused to quit after being attacked with a makeshift flamethrower. Callum Watkins laid a wreath for Remembrance Sunday in his full cadet's uniform just days after he was attacked at a bus stop in Manchester city centre. The schoolboy was left with minor burns after a stranger lit an aerosol spray and blasted it towards his face last week. Undeterred, he vowed to carry on selling poppies for the Royal British Legion - and said he wants to train as an army paramedic. Callum laid his wreath with friends from the Duke of Lancaster's Cadet Regiment during yesterday's Remembrance Sunday parade in Manchester. He said afterwards: 'Most of my mates were surprised that I still carried on selling the poppies. They've all been very good to me, they've helped pull me through it all.' The teenager was waiting for a bus home at 6pm on November 1 when he was attacked outside Manchester Art Gallery, less than 100 yards from the city's cenotaph. He had spent the day selling poppies and was wearing his camouflage uniform. Callum suffered minor burns to his face and singed hairs on his face and right forearm. His mother Kirsty Sloan said last week he was 'very upset' by the incident and confirmed he was now recovering at home. 'His face is burned and he is not very well,' she said. 'We just want whoever did this caught so that Callum can put it behind him.' At yesterday's service she said the family had been inundated with well-wishers nationwide and an invitation for Callum to meet RAF officials. His family has even been invited to afternoon tea with the Lord Mayor of Manchester Susan Cooley. Scroll down for video . Parade: The teenager joined friends from the Duke of Lancaster's Cadet Regiment for the Manchester service . The tribute by Callum was one of thousands by veterans and their families in Manchester city centre yesterday. A service was led by Bishop of Manchester David Walker and faith leaders on the 100th anniversary of the First World War, which killed 23,792 soldiers from Greater Manchester. Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester city council, said: 'The centenary certainly isn't necessarily something to celebrate, but it is something that we should remember.' Callum's attacker, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, was described as black or Asian, 5ft 8in tall and wearing a dark hooded top. Detective Inspector Liam Boden of Greater Manchester Police said last week it was an 'appalling attack on a young man who was raising money to help remember all those who gave their lives'. The 15-year-old said: 'Most of my mates were surprised that I still carried on selling the poppies' He added: 'At this stage of our inquiries, we're keeping an open mind as to what motivated the offender to commit such an act. 'Given the initial description we have of the offender, it may be that he was under the influence of something but whatever his motivation, his violent actions could have scarred this young man for life.' 'It is pure luck that he did not sustain more serious burns to his face and body. 'Understandably, both he and his family are in a state of total shock and cannot believe someone would do this. 'We need to find who ever is responsible for this crime and I would therefore appeal to anyone who has information.'","Callum Watkins, 15, was targeted at Manchester bus stop last week .

"A bride-to-be discovered she had a deadly brain tumour after her leg began jolting uncontrollably while she was vaccuming. Claire Dent, 43,  experienced a phenomenon known as myoclonic jerks - similar to the 'jumping limb' sensation people experience when drifting off to sleep. Mrs Dent, a part-time children’s centre assistant, said: 'For some reason, using the upright vacuum cleaner caused my right leg to start dancing about. I couldn’t even run the vacuum in a straight line. It was like my leg was doing Riverdance. Claire Dent, with husband Jez,  experienced a phenomenon known as myoclonic jerks while vaccuming - which led to the discovery of a brain tumour . Mrs Dent, on her wedding day with daughet Eve, described the jolting as similar to the 'jumping limb' sensation people experience when drifting off to sleep . 'It was frightening, but I hoped it was just a trapped nerve or sciatica, or the side-effect of sinusitis I was suffering with. 'The following day, as I was pegging out some washing, the sensation returned and I felt numbness spreading across my right side.' Mrs Dent, who has an 11-year-old daughter named Eve, was driven to A&E where she underwent a brain scan and doctors discovered a tumour the size of a golf ball. She was told she would need an operation to remove the tumour - a grade one frontal lobemeningioma - which was threatening to press down on her brain. If left alone to develop, the non-cancerous growth would kill her. Doctors told Mrs Dent the myoclonic jerks were because of the brain tumour - perhaps due to the tumour pressing on certain areas of the brain. Doctors told Mrs Dent the myoclonic jerks were because of the brain tumour - perhaps due to the tumour pressing on certain areas of the brain . The shock diagnosis prompted her to bring forward her marriage to her fiance Jez, 45, a self-employed labourer. She said: 'My dad was with me when they told me. He is a tough man’s man, but he broke down when we got the news. The words ""brain tumour"" sound so scary. 'I put on a tough face but my first thought was for my daughter Eve. I wanted her future to be secure. 'Me and Jez loved each other deeply, and suddenly we had a reason to get on with things and get married. 'Brain surgery always carries a risk and I wondered whether I would still be the same person after the operation. So it was important to me to get married sooner rather than later.' A church wedding was organised within five weeks, after which Mrs Dent, of Wakefield, began the painful process of writing farewell letters to her family and friends. Mrs Dent and husband Jez on their wedding day, which was brought forward after her diagnosis of a golf gall-sized brain tumour . She said: 'The wedding was perfect. I’d always wanted to get married in a church so be able to be there with everyone was wonderful. 'It was difficult writing the letters to Eve and Jez. In her letter, I told Eve that I loved her. 'I told her to brave and not let anyone tell her she couldn’t follow her dreams.' Finally, in November 2010, three months after her diagnosis, Mrs Dent underwent neurosurgery at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield to remove the tumour. She said: 'To hear the surgeon say afterwards that he had removed all the tumour was an enormous relief. I could start thinking about the future again.' Mrs Dent required a further round of emergency surgery a year later when the incision on the top of her head reopened, leaving her brain exposed. Three months after her diagnosis, Mrs Dent underwent neurosurgery at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield to remove the tumour . Following her diagnosis, Mrs Dent suffers from anxiety and has developed a phobia of housework after it led to her illness being diagnosed . Today, she suffers with anxiety and has developed a phobia of housework because of its association with the episode which led to the tumour diagnosis. She said: 'I tried replacing the upright hoover with a different type to see if that made any difference, but I’m still a nervous wreck around it. 'I couldn’t bare the thought of vacuuming the stairs in case I lost strength in my legs again. 'Jez is happy to accept that doing the vacuuming is his job now.' Mrs Dent has found a network of other brain tumour patients at www.braintumourdiaries.co.uk and is currently raising money for Ellie’s Fund Brain Tumour Trust, a registered charity raising money to support children with brain tumours and their families.

"When the Duchess of Cambridge was photographed with streaks of grey in her usually immaculate tresses, she decided it was high time to invest in some serious post-pregnancy styling. She booked an emergency appointment at the most expensive hairdresser in the country, then spent a marathon six hours being coiffed, coloured and blow-dried to ensure she was restored to her status as yummy mummy in chief. The Mail on Sunday has been told Kate spent more than half a day at the luxurious Rossano Ferretti hair spa in central London where a haircut with Italian-born Mr Ferretti costs £600. Scroll down for video . From grey to great: Kate had greying roots, left, a few weeks ago, but had a much deeper colour, right, recently . The 31-year-old Duchess arrived shortly after midday in a car with blacked-out windows and was whisked up to the VIP club suite on the third floor where she had her hair attended to in complete privacy by one of the salon’s leading colour technicians. Staff were told that ‘a VIP was in residence’ and lift access was shut off to make sure there were no interruptions. When she eventually emerged at 6pm, the Duchess was back to her former self – her crowning glory restored to a mass of tumbling chestnut-coloured curls. One witness who saw Kate leave said: ‘She looked amazing. She was dressed in a tartan cape and was made up. Her hair looked fabulous, really big and glossy, and it was flowing around her shoulders.’ It was Kate’s first opportunity Kate to indulge in some pampering since the birth of Prince George. Because she has been breastfeeding, she has spent most of her time at home with her son lately and her hair and beauty regime has understandably not been a priority. Lustrous locks: Kate showed off her new, glossy tresses at the SportsBall annual gala dinner in London last Thursday . Strains of motherhood: Kate's hair and beauty regime has understandably not been top priority since the birth of Prince George . But the Duchess was apparently horrified by how grey she looked when she saw pictures of herself at a Poppy Appeal event. So after being recommended to Rossano Ferretti by her sister Pippa, she checked herself in. Kate has previously had her hair cut and coloured at the Richard Ward salon in bustling Duke of York Square off Sloane Street in Chelsea. The Rossano Ferretti spa is quite different - occupying a discreet and innocuous building just off Hanover Square in the West End. Sought-after stylist: Rossano Ferretti, pictured, spent six hours restoring the future Queen to yummy mummy in chief . The Regency-style property looks more like a house than a hairdresser’s, but once you step inside, you are in hairdressing heaven, according to regulars. ‘It is the most luxurious place I have ever worked,’ said a member of staff who asked not to be named. ‘The client has their own suite and it’s incredibly private.’ Members of the Saudi royal family are regulars while Princess Diana was also on the books. Kate’s mother Carole Middleton is also understood to have visited. Appointments can last anything from an hour to an entire day. One of the most popular requests is Mr Ferretti’s signature ‘Method’ haircut. He uses hand-made texturising scissors to achieve what is described as ‘the invisible haircut’, taking weight out of the hair without compromising length. Mr Ferretti, who counts Hollywood actresses Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek among his famous clientele, has been cutting hair since he was 18. He now owns 20 salons around the world at locations including Beverly Hills, Milan and the Maldives. Given the newly lustrous appearance of Kate’s locks – which she showed off on Thursday night at a charity ball for the charity SportAid - it seems as though Rossano Ferretti could be tending to the most famous tresses in the country for some time yet. A spokesman for the hairdresser declined to comment last night.","Duchess of Cambridge was apparently horrified by how grey she looked .

"For most people their worst nightmare is facing their fear head on; arachnophobes, for example, wouldn’t want to be covered in spiders. But a researcher has claimed that confronting fears head on can actually be beneficial and help people get over them. In controlled experiments she locked people in cupboards to help them deal with panic attacks and anxiety disorders, and she says the method could be used for other phobias as well. A University of Oxford research has revealed a novel way to tackle phobias. Dr Andrea Reinecke told The Times how she exposed people to their fears (stock image of claustrophobia shown). For example she locked people in a cupboard for 15 minutes. This helped them deal with panic attacks and anxiety disorders . Speaking to The Times, Dr Andrea Reinecke from the University of Oxford explained how getting people to face their fears could cure them of their phobias. The method is known as single-session, exposure-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). For example, shutting them in a broom cupboard for 15 minutes could cure them of panic attacks and anxiety disorders in just one session. According to her study in the journal Biological Psychiatry, a third of patients were cured after one day of treatment. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a short-term psychological treatment based on the idea that negative thinking and behaviour can trigger problems such as depression or panic attacks. During treatment, the therapist helps patients identify these negative thoughts - and encourages them to work out a way of looking at things more positively. CBT is used to help with a wide range of mental health and physical conditions, including phobias, anger, relationship problems, sleep problems and eating disorders. The method involves ‘retraining the brain’ into recognising that something it took to be a fear is actually not as bad as thought. In the case of the broom cupboard Dr Reinecke told The Times: 'They only go in for 15 minutes , but I don’t tell them that. ‘They think I might keep them in there for the night. ‘We know that after 15 minutes anxiety goes down naturally if they don’t do anything.’ Performing the treatment helps patients realise that their fears were not as bad as they thought. For example one patient who had suffered panic attacks for 16 years was able to cope better using the simple therapy treatment. And Dr Reinecke says the single-session CBT treatment could be used in place of drugs for patients suffering certain mental conditions. She has been awarded a grant of £225,000 ($358,000) by the new mental health research charity MQ: Transforming Mental Health to trial the method for other phobias, including forcing arachnophobes to watch spiders up close for 30 minutes. The new method allowed a patient's brain to be 'retrained' when they overcame their fears. The single-session cognitive behavioural therapy has proved successful. A third of patients have been cured of their mental ailments. And it could be used to treat other fears like arachnophobia in future (stock image shown)","University of Oxford researcher reveals novel way to tackle phobias .

"The Obama administration dramatically moved Obamacare's second-year goalposts on Monday, saying that it expected no more than 9.9 million Americans to be enrolled in medical insurance through a government-managed system by the end of March. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan organization that advises federal legislators, assumed that the number would be a much higher 13 million in April, when it built the financial projections under-girding the law's implementation. Now the number could be as low as nine million. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Monday that her goal is 9.1 million. That number could go lower still, if less than 83 per cent of current Obamacare enrollees – 5.9 million people in all – renew their coverage in 2015. The news came just days after the Supreme Court said it would hear a case that could collapse the Obamacare system's financial structure. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell (left), spoke to former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland in front of a partisan crowd at the Obama-linked Center for American Progress . ROUND TWO: The Obamacare's infamously wonky website will go back online in five days to accept signups for 2015 . The Health and Human Services Department also lowered another number, dropping to 7.1 million its total number of Americans covered through March 2014, during the program's first 'open enrollment' period. The administration had said it enrolled 7.3 million, but many of those people were unable to complete enrollment.In total 112,000 people couldn't establish their citizenship or immigration status, which is required to qualify. The overall lower estimates for the 2014-2015 enrollment period stems from a two-year slower than expected shift to the government system by Americans who have their own insurance. 'That's been much lower than the predictions,' HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell told an audience at the liberal Center for American Progress on Monday. She also revealed that 'we've been writing letters' to 'folks who might come off the system,' in order to keep them in the fold next year. Barack Obama, both before and during his presidency, famously promised that Americans who wanted to keep their health plans would be able to. Now, however, maintaining Obamacare's solvency appears to depend on moving ever-more people away from the insurance they previously had outside government marketplaces. In addition, 120,000 U.S. households can expect to see their insurance costs increase on Dec. 1 of this year because when they signed up, they provided insufficient information about their incomes. When those numbers are recalculated, the portion of their premiums that taxpayers subsidize could shrink or disappear. FINGERS CROSSED: A year ago Healthcare.gov was a mess of historic proportions, but Burwell says her agency has increased the length of its software testing period by 350 per cent . HHS officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters during a Monday conference call that the CBO had assumed there would be 'significant shifts over three years' from people in employer-provided insurance and individual plans. But new data show 'there is considerable uncertainty that a large shift will occur over the new two years,' according to a new HHS report. But 'I wouldn't characterize it as an error,' an official said during the conference call. 'We think the evidence points to a longer ramp-up rate than the CBO projections had, and that is based on what we've learned over the last year from looking at our own data.' The Supreme Court case that justices agreed this weekend to hear will hinge on a single line in the law's text. At issue is whether the federal government is permitted to pay subsidies for insurance policies bought through its own Healthcare.gov website. The Affordable Care Act provided a mechanism for those taxpayer subsidies, but a literal reading of the words only allows the payments for policies brokered by states. Thirty-six states fall outside that group. Burwell said Monday that the White House will ultimately prevail because Congress intended to make everyone eligible for subsidies – regardless of what it wrote and passed into law. 'Nothing has changed,' she said, telling Americans that they shouldn't worry about whether their subsidies will be available in future years. 'The tax credits that they'll be signing up for, and the ones that they have, will be continuing.' Burwell insisted on Monday that the Obama administration will win a second Obamacare challenge in the Supreme Court . 'We believe that the law stated that the tax credits are an important part of affordable health care coverage – and that is for all,' Burwell added. 'We believe that that was the intention of the law, and believe that is where we will stay, and be.' Without the subsidy payments, Obamacare's financial structure would collapse as lower-income Americans would see their out-of-pocket premiums skyrocket. Despite all the Affordable Care Act's growing pains – a non-fuctioning website 12 months ago, high deductibles and a flood of doctors away from serving Obamacare patients among them – Burwell threw the gauntlet down at the feet of a newly emboldened Republican U.S. Senate majority. 'The repeal of the Affordable Care Act is not something that this administration will let happen,' she vowed. Asked how sure she was that the website would perform as advertised this time around, Burwell relied on numbers. 'Last year our testing was 10 days,' she said. 'This year our testing is five weeks.'","Congressional Budget Office projected 13 million signups by March 31, 2015 .
Now HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell says her goal is 9.1 million, but that number depends on keeping 5.9 million of last year's enrollees .

"A decorated World War II hero's son has been reunited with his father's five medals after losing them near the Cenotaph during yesterday's poignant ceremony. William McMurdo, 65, was proudly wearing the honours, which belonged to his father Thomas McMurdo, when he dropped them while caught up in the large crowds. They were found by veteran Cliff Palmer, 32, who immediately launched an online appeal through social media to track down their owner. Scroll down for video . Reunited: William McMurdo (right) was jubilant after his father's medals were returned to him today following an online campaign spearheaded by the man who found them - Royal Navy veteran Cliff Palmer (left) Mr Palmer, who was in the Royal Navy for ten years, uploaded the photos to Facebook and Twitter and they were shared by thousands of people in just a few hours. Today the pair met for the first time at the Cenotaph in London. Retired gardener Mr McMurdo, from Lewisham, South East London, said he was distraught when he realised he had lost the medals . He said: 'I've never been so upset in all my life - I felt like I'd let my father down. It was so devastating I didn't even want to tell people about it when I got home.

'I can't put into words how grateful I am for what he's done. 'When I heard that he had served in the Royal Navy, I knew he would understand how heart-breaking this has been for me. 'I'll be very glad to proudly wear them again on Remembrance Day.' Mr McMurdo's father was awarded the five medals, which include the Africa Star, the Italy Star, a 1939-1945 Star, a Defence Medal and a War Medal, after fighting for the duration of World War II as a sergeant in the 8th Army. After Cliff Palmer returned his medals  to him below London's Cenotaph today, Mr McMurdo said: 'I can't put into words how grateful I am for what he's done' His father was also awarded the bronze Oak Leaf and mentioned in dispatches for rescuing 20 comrades from a minefield at the infamous 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino, Italy, - which William proudly wore to the service. Mr McMurdo, whose father passed away in 1976, added: 'It was a brilliant feeling so see Cliff walking towards me with the medals. 'As soon as I saw him I could tell he was an ex-serviceman - he looked very smart and professional. 'I have no idea how to thank him and those who helped get the medals back to me - it's been truly overwhelming.'

'It was a fantastic experience and then as I was crossing the road I could see the medals face down on the floor. 'A few people walked over them and my heart hit the floor - it was devastating. 'I picked them up and I couldn't believe my eyes - the owner of these medals is a true hero. 'That is what the Remembrance Service is all about - honouring the people that gave everything and more for our freedom. 'So I was determined to get them back to the owner and I posted a picture on my Facebook account but had no luck. 'But friends started seeing it and sharing it and one of my pals set up a Lostbox feed and the story went viral.' Mr Palmer served on a number of Type 42 ships during his time in the armed forces including HMS Ark Royal and HMS York . Proud father Cliff, who now works as a part-time doorman, travelled from Bristol in the early hours of the morning to attend the service in London where he was left devastated to see the medals on the ground. But after posting an image online - Clare Owen set up a page on Lostbox to share the image and help trace its original owner. Cliff said: 'Clare has been absolutely fantastic - without her we'd never have found William. 'My grandfather had some of the same medals and he would have been absolutely distraught if he'd have lost his. 'I felt terrible when I saw them lying on the floor and I know William would have been exactly the same. 'But to see the look on his face when I gave them back was incredible.'","Distinguished collection was dropped during yesterday's poignant ceremony .

"Deputies in Florida say an 81-year-old man picked thousands of tangerines - 11 truckloads worth - and then sold the stolen bounty at a nearby market. Herman Southall was charged Wednesday with 11 counts of transporting citrus without a certificate, grand theft of more than 2,000 pieces of citrus and trespassing. He is being held at the Polk County Jail on an $8,500 bond. Suspect: Herman Southall is accused of stealing eleven truckloads of tangerines then selling them . Southall was able to sell the fruit on Tuesday for over $300, according to deputies, The Orlando Sentinel reported. Southall and another man were found by deputies Wednesday picking fruit in a Dundee grove after a Sheriff's Office helicopter pilot saw them. It's unclear if he has retained an attorney. Deputies say the two had picked more than four rows of Sunburst tangerines. The report said they were preparing to load the fruit into Southall's truck. The Orlando Sentinel, citing a copy of the report it obtained, said Southall had claimed to authorities he 'talked to someone several years ago' regarding the fruit collection and was unable to provide contact information. Deputies said in the report that Southall also presented false proof of purchase documentation, according to the newspaper. There were over 2,000 tangerines recovered at the time of his arrest, they also reportedly said.

"A pair of amateur British stargazers have discovered a new planet – for only the third time in history. Chris Holmes and Lee Threapleton spotted the new world during a project to find planets beyond our solar system publicised by Professor Brian Cox in his Stargazing Live series. The pair will receive the honour of having the planet named after them, once scientists have confirmed its authenticity. Brave new world: An artist's impression shows the potential new planet discovered by two 'citizen scientists' on a planet-hunting website . They made the discovery after spotting changes in light patterns in an image from Nasa’s Kepler space telescope. The unusual patterns suggested a planet appears to be orbiting a sun called SPH10066540, which lies between 600 and 3,000 light years away. ‘Threapleton Holmes B’, as the planet will be known, is thought to be gaseous, and around the size of Neptune. Helping out: The public look at time-lapse images of stars on Planethunters.org to check for any blips in light that could indicate a planet . Marking history: The volunteers are then asked to mark any anomalies on a graph . How it works: As the planet passes over the star, the brightness of the star dims. This can be picked up on the time-lapse images from Nasa's Kepler telescope . The image had been posted online at . Planethunters.org, an Oxford University project that asks the public to . sift through time-lapsed data from Nasa in the hope of new discoveries. Mr Holmes, of Peterborough, said: ‘I’ve never even had a telescope. 'I’ve had a passing interest in where things are in the sky, but never had any more knowledge about it than that. ‘Being the one to find something is a very exciting position.’ But the other amateur stargazer, Mr Threapleton, may not even know he is set to have a planet named after him, as the project’s team have not yet been able to reach him. Dr Chris Lintott, from Oxford University, said: ‘The candidate planet is unlikely to have life because it is too hot. 'It is too close to its star and the sheer heat makes life unlikely.’ It is believed to be only the third time British amateurs have found a new planet. The first was William Herschel, who discovered Uranus in 1781. Nasa's Kepler space telescope launched in 2009 and has been beaming back pictures of stars similar to our Sun ever since. Its time-lapse images plot any periodic dips in light that occur when a planet passes in front of a star. These dips, called 'transits', have to be observed several times before a new planet can be confirmed. Chris Holmes, the British citizen scientist who has discovered a potential new planet after observing a transit, has only found one pass. However, the Planethunters team has since found other transits in its archives for that star suggesting the planet could be genuine.",The planet is thought to be gaseous and about the size of Neptune .

Ms Furness spends her time lobbying for children's rights and in 2013 she publicly slammed Australia's 'anti-adoption culture', insisting that extreme adoption measures deter couples who are interested . 'It was not supportive, it was not informative, it was not pro-active.' The lack of support that came from Australia's adoption process prompted Ms Furness and her husband to begin looking at options overseas. 'We need to look at creating relationships with inter-country adoption with sending countries like Cambodia,' Ms Furness said. 'Post-adoption support [is needed] to educate parents what it is to parent a child that may have come from a war zone or from abuse. 'You have to have the tools to know how to parent a fragile child and you need to have a support system for the children that are going through this.' Australia has on of the lowest rates of adoption in the world, with around a 77 per cent decline in the number of adoptions over the past 25 years, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. It has also been reported that in the 2013-14 financial year only 339 children were adopted in Australia; 129 from overseas and 210 locally. Ms Furness and her husband also set up the Jackman Furness Foundation for the Performing Arts, in an attempt to support art students.

"From stunning gemstones to glittering snowflakes, the mesmerising patterns of crystals can be found everywhere in nature. Their beautiful structure has provided scientists with an understanding of matter itself, giving them incredible insights into the intricate patterns of everyday objects. Now London-based photographer Max Alexander had shed light on some of these shapes, highlighting the importance of a technique known as X-ray crystallography. Photographer Max Alexander had shed light on some of the shapes of substances created by a technique known as x-ray crystallography. Pictured here is the rapid crystallisation of a cancer drug . The method describes a process that allows scientists to find the shape of molecules and then learn more about their atomic arrangement. It was pioneered in the early 20th century when scientists discovered that X-rays could be used to 'see' the structure of matter in a non-intrusive way. When X-rays hit a protein crystal they are scattered by individual atoms, and the way they are diffracted depends on the how the atoms in the molecule are arranged. Using sophisticated mathematical techniques, an X-ray diffraction pattern can be used to work out the relative positions of different atoms in a molecule. Crystallographers now use their knowledge of the structure of objects to change it and improve both its properties and behaviour. In this image, a tiny crystal squeezed between diamonds - the hardest structures on Earth - subjects it to extreme pressures and making the crystal structure change . The eye of crystallographer Margarete Neu reflected from her computer screen. The scientist creates crystals to understand how they interact with new medicines . Crystallographer David Keen (pictured) studies crystal structures that behave in strange ways. In this image, he has created holes in Porthcawl beach in South Wales to portray the neutron diffraction pattern from a quartz crystal . Crystallography is the study of atomic and molecular structure. The method describes a process that allows scientists to find the shape of molecules and then deduce their atomic arrangement. It was pioneered in the early 20th century when it was discovered that X-rays could be used to 'see'  structure of matter in a non-intrusive way. When -rays hit a protein crystal they are scattered by individual atoms, and the way they are diffracted depends on the how the atoms in the molecule are arranged. Using sophisticated mathematical techniques, an x-ray diffraction pattern can be used to work out the relative positions of different atoms in a molecule. For instance, the double-helical structure of DNA was found from an X-ray diffraction pattern that had been generated by a fibrous sample. Mr Alexander told MailOnline that this is perhaps the biggest breakthrough achieved by the technique. 'Crystallography is a process in which art and science overlap,' he said. 'But while it has achieved a great deal in science, it is very much an unsung story.' The 53-year-old, originally from New Zealand, is hoping his photographs of the science and the people who made it happen, could raise the profile of crystallography. Mr Alexander said aspects of science can be very difficult to understand, but he hopes his images will simplify ideas to get those concepts across. 'It opens up a new set of people that might be engaged with crystallography and the science, just as we're engaging with the arts,' he told the BBC. In one image, technicians are shown forming a fan blade for a jet engine from titanium alloys, by injecting high-pressure argon gas at around 1,000 degrees celcius. Crystallography experiments carried out on these blades helps to understand how their performance is affected by the materials used in the manufacturing process. In another image, crystallographer David Keen was captured by Mr Alexander creating holes in Porthcawl beach in South Wales to portray the neutron diffraction pattern from a quartz crystal. In addition to looking pretty, the crystal shapes can also serve an important purpose. For example, needle-shaped crystals in drugs can be hard to analyse but finding the right crystal is the first step in the development of treatments for diseases such as malaria.

To understand this process better, scientists try to grow crystals and solve the structures of the proteins from which they are built. These crystals are of a protein that co-ordinates the assembly of this important machine. Mr Alexander took the images as part of the International Year of Crystallography, designed to celebrate the technique. Mr Alexander's photos are currently being shown at the Illuminating Atoms exhibition in London's Royal Albert Hall. The exhibition will be open until the 7 December 2014.

"An oil tycoon has been ordered to pay nearly $1 billion in a divorce settlement to his wife, making it one of the biggest payouts in history. Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm was ordered by an Oklahoma County judge to hand over close to $1 billion to his ex-wife Sue Ann Hamm, according to a court filing made public on Monday. Special Judge Howard Haralson found that Hamm, 68, should pay Mrs Hamm a total of $995.5 million, with about a third of the funds, or $322.7 million, to be paid by the end of the year, the filing revealed. Harold Hamm was ordered by an Oklahoma County judge to hand over close to $1 billion to his ex-wife Sue Ann Hamm (pictured), according to court filings released on Monday . Forbes named the oil tycoon the 30th richest person in the U.S. in 2012 and 76th richest person in the world. His fortune is estimated at $14billion today . Hamm will then be required to pay the rest of the judgment, some $650 million, in installments worth at least $7 million per month. Sue Ann Hamm has already been awarded around $25 million since the case was filed in 2012. To secure the judgment, Judge Haralson has placed a lien on 20 million shares of Continental stock. The ruling, which is subject to appeal, comes after a ten-week divorce trial which ended last month. Hamm started Continental in 1967, and about 68 per cent of the firm's shares are in his name. His stake was worth more than $18 billion when the trial started in August. It's worth around $14 billion today. Since the couple wed in 1988, Continental has grown from a small-time driller worth less than $50 million into a $20 billion behemoth and one of Oklahoma's largest companies. Because Harold owned his shares before he and Sue Ann were married, they belong to him. But under Oklahoma law, their 'active' appreciation since 1988 is subject to 'equitable distribution' with Sue Ann, a former executive at Continental who filed for divorce from Harold in 2012. Her legal team contends that the amount of marital wealth the court should divide is more than $17 billion, a sum that included most of Harold's stake in Continental a few months before the trial began. In a court filing from 2013, Mrs Hamm alleged that her husband was having an affair, which prompted her to file for divorce. Mrs Hamm, 56, has held key posts at Continental, but she no longer works for the company. Court filings showed that his attorneys argued that the couple's shared wealth is a tiny fraction of that amount. The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement. Harold Hamm's leadership at Continental is central to the case. The Hamms own four houses together including this vast property in an exclusive enclave of Nichols Hills, Oklahoma . High-life: Sue Ann Hamm and the couple's daughter Jane are pictured at a lunch for the Wall Street Journal Innovator of Year award . In court, his lawyers attributed most of Continental's success not to Hamm's business savvy but to factors beyond his control - that market factors such as rising oil prices, or decisions made prior to marriage caused Continental's growth. The trial ended on October 9. This is the second divorce for Hamm after he divorced his first wife, Judith Ann, in 1987. They have three children together. In 1988, Hamm married Sue Ann, an economist and lawyer. The couple had two daughters, Jane and Hillary. The oil magnate lives in Oklahoma City and owns homes in Enid, Oklahoma and Nichols Hills, Oklahoma. The vast Nichols Hills property is believed to be worth in the region of $3million. Video Source YouTube . Harold Hamm pictured with Mitt Romney during his run for the White House. The oil tycoon donated close to $1million to the Republican candidate's campaign . Forbes named him the 30th richest person in the U.S. in 2012 and 76th richest person in the world. He had humble beginnings, growing up in rural Oklahoma where he was the 13th child of Oklahoma cotton sharecroppers. Mr Hamm spent his youth picking cotton, before starting his career at 20 by scrubbing the scum out of oil barrels. He worked his way up and was eventually able to drill his own wells. Fond of eating at burger bars, Mr Hamm has a reputation for being down-to-earth and drives his own truck. His big breakthrough came in the Nineties, when he helped discover the Bakken field of North Dakota, the largest new US oil prospect since the Sixties. Mr Hamm is a staunch Republican and donated close to a million dollars to Mitt Romney's presidential bid in 2012.

"Celebrated: Napoleon Bonaparte will be commemorated with a new theme park to be built at the site of the Battle of Montereau - if funding can be secured . After almost 200 years, the last thing you would think the French want is a daily reminder of the devastating military defeats at Waterloo and Trafalgar. But now a theme park is being planned in honour of Napoleon Bonaparte - and will stage daily re-enactments of the victories for Wellington and Nelson. Dubbed 'Napoleonland', the attraction is likely to be built on the site of one of the military leader's most famous victories. If funding is secured for the £180million park it is expected to create 3,000 jobs and could ultimately emerge as a rival to Disneyland. There are plans to build it at the site where Napoleon defeated the Austrians in the Battle of Montereau in 1814 in Montereau-Fault-Yonne just south of Paris. The six-day battle was the nation's last military victory over the Austrians. The Battle of Waterloo, which put an end to Napoleon's rule in France, is expected to be recreated on a daily basis and visitors may even be able to take part in the reenactments. They will also be able to take in a water show recreating the Battle of Trafalgar. A museum, a hotel, shops, restaurants and a congress are all expected to be built at the park. Planners are also hoping to recreate the killing of Louis XVI, France's last King, who died after being guillotined during the Revolution. And in another attraction visitors may be able to ski around the bodies of soldiers and horses frozen on the battlefield. Napoleon is the second most famous French and much-celebrated leader after Charles De Gaulle - so it remains to be seen how much room his countrymen give over to Lord Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar. French politician Yves Jego, who is . backing the project, hopes that construction work can get underway in . 2014 and the park open its doors in 2017. It is expected to be based loosely on Asterix, a French theme park, and Puy du Fou a leisure park with Viking-themed attractions. He is planning to unveil full details of what the attraction will contain on February 18 - the 198th anniversary of the Battle of Montereau. Famous spot: The park is likely to be built at Montereau-Fault-Yonne - the site of the Battle of Montereau in 1814 . Theme: The park is expected to be loosely based on Parc Asterix, a French theme park (pictured) just outside Paris . Napoleon is well-known in Russia and China and it is hoped the attraction will bolster French tourism. Despite being one of France's most decorated leaders, there is no national museum dedicated to Napoleon and Mr Jego said he hopes that it will help the military leader retain his place in the French national consciousness. Charles Napoleon, who is a descendant of the military leader's brother, told The Times: 'There is a huge gulf between his celebrity abroad and the few important events about him in this country.' Mr Jego added: 'As well as being an instrument of economic development, this is a question of rediscovering our roots and our history. 'We are going to combine historical truth with pure entertainment.' He added that Napoelonland would be 'unbiased' and eschew the dominant French view that the military leader was a great man. Local government officials are supporting the ambitious project and Mr Jego is searching for private sector investors to help fund the project. It is hoped that the park would attract around 1.5million visitors in its first year. Reenactment: The park is expected to recreate the Battle of Waterloo on a daily basis. Here people re-enact the Battle of Montereau on the original battlefield - close to where the new park will be built . Derided by the English as nothing more than a tyrant, a theme park will provide a very modern memorial to Napoleon Bonaparte. Born in 1769, the celebrated leader seized power in a coup in 1799 and became first consul. He defeated the Austrians at Marengo before negotiating peace on the continent in 1803 and establishing French dominance. The Battle of Austerlitz: An artist's recreation of the French's famous military victory over the Russo-Austrian army . But it is the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 that he is remembered for in Britain. The British - led by Lord Nelson aboard HMS Victory - secured a decisive victory over a French and Spanish coalition. Although the British officer secured a decisive victory he was shot dead while on deck. Beaten by the Brits, Napoleon turned his attention back to the continent and secured arguably his, and France's, greatest military victory the same year. In the Battle of Austerlitz the Russo-Austrian army were decisively defeated. The battle, fought in what is now the Czech Republic, saw the French gain a lot of new territory. It was the Peninsular War, which began in 1808, with Portugal, Spain and the UK, which was ultimately to prove his undoing. After being defeated in a battle in Moscow in 1812, Paris fell in 1814 after a series of disastrous French defeats. After going into exile, he regained power briefly in 1815 only to be defeated at the Battle of Waterloo. Following the Duke of Wellington's victory, Napoleon abdicated. He was imprisoned by the British and died in custody in 1821.","£180million park to be built on site of famous battle and create 3,000 jobs .

One drawing is even similar to a helter skelter and another mirrors the shape of a drill. The winning design, by Stewart, Maclaren and Dunn, received a prize of 500 guineas and according to documents was 215 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower. Unusual: This design on the right looks like the eye-catching Shard that's just been built at London Bridge . Copying? These designs still resemble the Eiffel Tower. The winning design was 180ft taller than the Shard . It would also have been 180 feet taller than the Shard, which is the tallest building in Europe. Just like the second placed tower, it bears a strong similarity to the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Tower was subsidised by the French government, whereas the bill for the Great Tower of London was footed completely by the British firm, Tower Company, which held the design competition. Forty seven metres of the winning design was built before it was demolished and Wembley Stadium built . The fun fair was opened to the public in 1896 before the ill-fated attraction, still only 47 metres high, was demolished in 1907 after problems with shifting foundations. It became known as the Watkins Folly or The London Stump and Wembley Stadium was built over the top of it for the 1923  British Empire Exhibition. When the stadium was rebuilt 12 years ago the concrete foundations of the tower were rediscovered. Problems: Money ran out to build the winning design. The entry on the right looks much like a drill . Paris's Eiffel Tower was built in . 1889 by Gustave Eiffel, and was originally the entrance arch to that . year’s Universal Exposition– a world fair celebrating Gallic . engineering.

"Temperatures are set to plummet as much as 40 degrees in a single day in parts of the United States - with as much as a foot of snow also due to fall in an onrush of wintry weather. The Upper Midwest will be hit first by the frigid weather system from the north, which is being pushed in by the remnants of a freezing typhoon which hit Alaska over the weekend. Montana and the Dakotas were hit by three inches of snow Sunday - and now the flurries have pushed further east into Minnesota and Wisconsin, where they will dump up to 12 inches of snow in coming days. Scroll down for video . Frosty: A man makes his way through Mears Park in St Paul, Minnesota, on a chilly Monday . Anyone for a snowball fight? Three schoolchildren in St Paul, Minnesota, make their way to school . Winter is here: Snow hit Minnesota Monday morning, with more set to come. Pictured is the scene in Hopkins, a suburb of Minneapolis . Chill factor: Monday night, forecast above, will bring even more severe temperatures across the Upper Midwest . Bringer of winter: Typhoon Nuri, which struck Alaska over the weekend and is now dissipating over the Bering Sea, between Alaska and Russia, has driven blasts of cold air over North America. It was pictured above by a Nasa satellite on November 5 . The north-most parts of the country will be hit by temperatures well below freezing Monday, with the highest prediction in Great Falls, Montana, just 17 degrees. The normal temperature for mid-November is 43. The forecast for Sioux Falls, South Dakota, is a high of 25, which is about 20 degrees below normal. High temperatures in Minneapolis will only reach the upper 20s. 'We're kind of getting locked in winter's grip here,' said Troy Kleffmen, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Aberdeen, South Dakota. Other states will be hit by snowfall in the coming days too, according to the service. Predictions said some snow would hit Wyoming, Idaho, Maine and upstate New York Monday. Flurries will continue through the week, with falls in Colorado, Nebraska and north-east Illinois Tuesday morning. Heavy shifting: Snow plows were put to work on the streets of Minneapolis . Making the most of it: Student Wren Scott-Lumbar, 11, got the day off school due to snow and went skiing in St Cloud, Minnesota, on Monday .

Shivers: Snow in Minneapolis had people like Gabby Lopez, pictured, wrapped up warm as winter came early . Cold: Drivers were being careful on the freeways around Minneapolis Monday morning after the early snowfalls . Traffic: The I-35 freeway was held up while drivers took were challenged by the snowfall . Weather to come: Tuesday will bring snow across Wisconsin, Minnesota, parts of Illinois and the north tip of Maine, with heavier storms in Wyoming and Montana . By Friday morning snow will be falling over all of New England, most of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as the vast majority of New York state, stopping just short of New York City. A new burst of snow is predicted for the center of the country late Saturday, hitting Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, Indiana and northern parts of Texas. National Weather Service meteorologist Gino Izzi in Chicago warned that city will be hit by wintry weather sooner than usual too. He said highs are expected to settle into the 30s from Tuesday through Friday, while nightly lows could drop into the 20s, perhaps even the teens. 'It doesn't look real promising for a warmup after that, either,' he added. Coming to the north-east: By Friday morning, snows to the east will have spread across all of New England, Michigan and most of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. New York state will be hit, but New York City spared . Wintry: These cyclists faced a significantly tougher commute than thanks to the flurries . Time to get clearing: Workers in St Cloud, Minnesota, set about dealing with the snow, which could fall much deeper by the end of the week . The  weather is part of a system being pushed in by the remnants of Typhoon Nuri that hit Alaska's Aleutian Islands with hurricane-strength winds over the weekend. That storm is expected to lose strength as it passes into the Bering Sea, but forecasters warned it will still push unseasonably frigid air into much of the U.S. this week. When the storm, which has been dubbed the Bering Bomb on social media, hit Alaksa it was even more intense than Superstorm Sandy, which devastated the north-east of the country in 2012. But Nuri did much less damage as it hit remote areas where people are used to extreme weather. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has not predicted a repeat of last winter, where air from the polar vortex froze huge swathes of the country. However, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration isn't expecting a repeat of the 2013-2014 season. Federal forecasters predicted last month that this winter will be fairly average without a lot of extreme conditions such as last year's Arctic influx from the polar vortex. Chills: A woman walks her dog through snowy scenes in Bismarck, the capital of North Dakota, on Monday . Further east: The streets of Wisconsin were also dusted with snow. Pictured is Coloma, where workers are burying bulbs ahead of spring despite the flurries . Central U.S.: Saturday night and early Sunday morning will also bring snowfall to the center of the country, hitting states such as Nebraska, Kansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma and the northern tip of Texas . The Midwest's cold weather is expected to bring a host of travel delays.Delta Airlines said the new falls could affect flights to and from Wisconsin and Minnesota. Driving could also become difficult in storm-hit areas - but locals, who put up with the weather most every year, are not worried. Even though South Dakota rancher Roger Weiss lives 35 miles from the nearest town, Faith - with a population of less than 450 people - and 70 miles from a grocery store, in Sturgis, he said the coming snow generally doesn't worry him. 'Roads are generally good, a lot of times they're blowed clean,' he said.","Waves of wintry weather could send temperatures tumbling 40 degrees .

"A man has been mauled by a pack of dingos in a vicious attack on an island off Queensland, which left him in hospital with wounds to his head and body. Dane Allen was in the Happy Valley township of Fraser Island, which is located of the south-east coast of Queensland, when he apparently walked down to the beach to make a phone call. The 25-year-old was on his own about 10.30pm on Monday evening when suddenly found himself in the company of four dingoes, according to news.com.au. Dane Allen found himself in the company of three angry dingoes on a beach on Fraser Island on Monday night . Paramedics told the website they believe Mr Allen managed to scare one of the animals away, but the other three were undeterred and went at him. The man, who works as a chef on the island, suffered puncture wounds to his heads, legs and backside before he escaped and was discovered by fishermen nearby. His clothes were shredded off and remnants of these items were apparently still on the beach on Tuesday morning. The 25-year-old was in the Happy Valley township on the east side of the island when he was attacked . David Anderson, Fraser Island spokesman, said Mr Allen was lucky to escape without any life-threatening injuries. 'He covered himself to protect his face and throat, stomach and groin; he was lucky because he was able to protect himself,' Mr Anderson said. Mr Allen was taken to Hervey Bay Hospital back on the mainland of Queensland. He was taken to hospital on the Queensland mainland and rangers have issues a renewed warning about the danger of dingoes in light of the incident . Residents told the website he had been employed at the Fraser Island Retreat at Happy Valley - on the eastern side of the island - for about eight months. The attack has prompted rangers on the island to say they will up their rounds in the area, where dingo attacks have occurred before. Happy Valley is fenced against dingoes, and a longer fence spanning almost 2 kilometres was completed last month on the island. A dingo fence has been in place in Happy Valley for many years after a series of dingo attacks . The Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service issued a warning for visitors to be extra vigilant in light of the incident, and said people should not walk or jog along the beaches alone at night. In 2001 nine-year-old Clinton Gage was attacked and killed by two dingoes near Waddy Poiny on Fraser Island, about 50 kilometres south of the Happy Valley township. Following his death, more than 30 dingoes were culled on the island - which caused outcry from the local residents. At the end of 2012, rangers killed a six-month-old dingo called Inky for fears he would seriously injure a human when he grew older, after a series of attacks on people on the island. In 2001 a nine-year-old boy was killed when he was attacked by a pair of dingoes on the same island .","Dane Allen was attacked by a pack of dingoes on Fraser Island off the coast of Queensland .

"A six-year-old boy died yesterday after he was allegedly beaten up by his class teacher at a private school in India for not speaking in English. It is claimed the teacher at the school in the Tirumalagiri village of Anumula mandal, in Nalgonda district, struck the boy on Saturday for speaking in his tribal language of Telugu. The boy has been named locally as Ramavath Chandu. A six-year-old boy died after allegedly hitting his head against a wall after being attacked by his teacher in Anumula mandal, in Nalgonda district . According to Chandu's relatives he was allegedly slapped by his teacher after arriving late to school. He is then thought to have hit his head on a nail poking out of a wall. The Times Of India reported that Chandu fell ill soon after returning home from school and that his condition had worsened overnight. After being admitted to a hospital in Hyderabad he died early yesterday morning. The teacher involved has been named as Sumathi. Chandu's relatives yesterday held his body outside the schools main gates and refused to leave until the teacher and the school's principal were arrested. The boy's parents, are also believed to have sought compensation from the school and the government. Senior police officials were sent to the school to help deal with the unrest, but it is understood the protest ended later that afternoon after the boy's parents came to an understanding with school officials. Child Rights Protection Committee president Anuradha Rao said the teacher involved 'deserves nothing less than life imprisonment'. She claimed the teacher had 'severely' beaten Chandu up after becoming angry with him not speaking in English.

"A relaxing day scuba diving soon turned into a scene from the film Jaws for two divers  when a Great White shark appeared from nowhere and left them scrambling desperately to get out of the water. Adelaide University Scuba Club divers Mark Sutcliffe and Jan Busch got up close and personal with the Great White at the Glenelg tyre reef last weekend. The Advertiser reported that the divers encountered the “largest fish” they had ever seen on Sunday. They could only watch in horror as the shark circled the pair three times before disappearing into the blue. Scroll down for video . Look out! The Great White shark closes in on the two scuba divers . In a post to the club’s Facebook page, Sutcliffe made the understatement of the month by describing it as an 'interesting dive'. Feeding time: The Great White takes a closer look at the two divers from Adelaide University Scuba Club . 'Well done Jan Busch for snapping these shots while I had half my body inside a tyre tetrahedron and breathing my ass off,' he wrote. 'We waited until it cleared off before exiting the water. Omitted the safety stop on the way up!' The shark circled the pair three times before disappearing into the blue . Adelaide University Scuba Club president Gail Jackman however, was not so light-hearted about the close encounter of the man-eating kind, and said the club would review its safety policies in light of what happened. Jackman said the policy of each boat having a shark shield attached to its anchor line may change to ensure that each group of divers now had a shark shield with them underwater in the future as well. 'Sharks are always there – that’s the risk you take as a scuba diver,' Jackman said. 'Safety is the most important thing.'

"A young mother died from cervical cancer – after being turned down for a smear test nine times by her GP. Jess Evans, 22, visited her local surgery nine times in two months complaining of stomach pain, fatigue and abnormal bleeding. But doctors repeatedly sent her away, saying her symptoms were caused by her body getting back to normal after the birth of her son Riley. Scroll down for video . Jess Evans, 22, died in February having been diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer last April. She visited doctors nine times repeatedly complaining of stomach pain, abnormal bleeding and bloating . But doctors told Miss Evans, left, and her mother Marie, right, that her symptoms were the result of her having just given birth to her son Riley, and added that due to her age there was 'no cause for concern' Miss Evans, pictured with her mother Marie (right) passed away in February this year. Her mother is now campaigning to lower the smear test age from 25 to 16, believing had her daughter been tested at 16, it might have saved her life . They failed to give her a smear test, as the national minimum screening age is 25, and told her there was ‘no cause for alarm’. Miss Evans, from Hagley, Worcestershire, was finally sent for a camera scan last April at her local hospital, but the test was too late to save her. As her terrified mother Marie looked on, the doctor who carried out the procedure exclaimed: ‘Oh my God, how long have you been like this?’ Miss Evans, a care worker, was given just ten months to live and died this February. Now her mother is backing an e-petition calling on the Government to lower the smear test age from 25 to 16. She believes her daughter would still be alive had she been offered a test. Mrs Evans, 46, from Oldbury in the West Midlands, told ITV’s This Morning her daughter had ‘not long had a baby when her symptoms appeared’. Mrs Evans told This Morning she is desperate to raise awareness of cervical cancer and said she wants to see the age at which women are first asked for a smear test lowered from 25 to 16 . Dr Dawn Harper told This Morning the age limit for smear tests was raised from 20 to 25 after concerns high numbers of young women were receiving treatment they didn't need. She said: 'The age limit used to be over 20 in England. 'The reasons it was changed was based on National Screening Community, it wasn't financially driven. 'The cervix systems develop in the early 20s for a lot of women. 'We were getting multiple abnormal smear results for lots of young girls, which were causing anxiety and some were having treatment that wasn't absolutely necessary, and increased the risk of premature labour or miscarriage if they got pregnant later in life. 'The thinking was cervical cancer is very rare under 25 and so the age of screening should be raised. 'That is awful for you to hear (Mrs Evans). 'It is really important that while we don't screen under 25s, anyone suffering abnormal bleeding must always, always, report it to their doctor. 'I have a rule of threes, if someone comes back with the same symptoms three times I am not getting it. 'My advice is don't be scared to ask for a referral for a second opinion.' She added: ‘That is what they were putting it down to, that and her age. 'She was having bleeding and she wasn’t feeling very well, really tired all the time. She kept going and they kept telling her she was anaemic. ‘We really thought something wasn’t right. She went back to the doctors nine times. But you never expect the C word, that’s not something you think.’ Recalling her daughter’s diagnosis, Mrs Evans said: ‘Jess was hysterical. I just went numb, I had no words. 'I don’t actually know how we got home that day. You go into this world, a frozen state, I couldn’t think of anything.’ Mrs Evans gave up her job to care for her daughter, and eventually moved in with her. She told baby Riley, now two, that his mummy was poorly. ‘He would kiss her tummy,’ Mrs Evans said, adding: ‘He is always asking for his mummy.’ Miss Evans’s brother James said: ‘She got so ill, Riley couldn’t cuddle her. I think that’s what broke her.’ And Mrs Evans added: ‘She was fobbed off time and time again.’ The NHS offers cervical screening tests to all women aged 25 to 64. They identify abnormalities which could develop into cancer. The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 in 2003 after advice from the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening. Experts were mindful of how rare the disease is in women under 25, and feared the test could provide abnormal results which sometimes left women receiving treatment they didn’t need. About 2,900 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK. The symptoms aren't always obvious and may not appear until the disease has reached an advanced stage. In most cases, abnormal bleeding is the first sign. It usually occurs after sex although any unusual bleeding should be investigated. Other symptoms include pain in and around the vagina during sex, an unpleasant smelling discharge and pain when passing urine. Around 2,900 cases of cervical cancer, pictured under the microscope, are diagnosed each year in the UK . If the cancer has spread there may be other symptoms including constipation, blood in the urine, loss of bladder control, bone pain and swelling in the legs and kidneys. The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years. It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb). If you are concerned about symptoms but are under 25 you have the right to an internal examination. Maddy Durrant, of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, says: 'There is a pathway in place that means a patient should be checked or referred if they are exhibiting symptoms. 'We advise women to challenge their doctor if they say they do not need a test.' She adds that it can help if you print out a list of symptoms, such as from the charity's website, to make your point understood. 'Cervical cancer is rare in women under 25, but it's not impossible.'","Jess Evans was diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer in April 2013 .

"Bruce Batten was surprised to see an unseasonable visitor on the second-floor deck of his Eagle River home. The former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employee from Anchorage heard his dogs barking at about 1:30am Friday. He looked out of the French doors off his bedroom, flipped on a light and saw what was upsetting the dogs: a black bear feeding on a bird feeder. The audience didn't bother the bear. Unwelcome guest: In this November 7, 2014 photo provided by Bruce Batten, a black bear eats seeds inside a bird feeder on a second-floor porch after walking up a flight of stairs in Eagle River, Alaska . 'He's like, ""Excuse me, I'm having a little snack here,'"" Batten told the Alaska Dispatch News. The incident and others prompted the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to warn residents that southcentral Alaska bears have not taken to winter dens and may be attracted to birdfeeders and cans of trash. Mild temperatures and little snow have led to bears hanging around, said Dave Battle, an assistant area wildlife biologist with the Department of Fish and Game. Bears want to load up on calories before denning, and bird seed and trash are a strong temptation, Battle said. 'It's most likely to stay out a bit longer, packing in the last calories that it can,' Battle said. Bird feeders should remain inside for a few more weeks, he said. Batten retired from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1998 and knows bear habits. 'As we used to say in the Fish and Wildlife Service, ""Wait until Thanksgiving and then when you eat a bird you can feed a bird,""' he said. The Department of Fish and Game recommends southcentral Alaska residents keep bird feeders inside between April and November 1. Batten over the summer obtained a 'particularly nice' bird feeder and was anxious to hang it when November arrived. The state agency received other bear reports from Eagle River and even from the Government Hill neighborhood north of downtown Anchorage. 'Just because someone doesn't live in one of the areas mentioned doesn't mean it's safe for them to leave their trash unsecured or put out bird feeders,' Battle said.","Bruce Batten from Eagle River, Anchorage, photographed a bear outside his home last week eating from a birdfeeder .

"Hit TV show Game of Thrones has been lambasted by linguistic experts for its dodgy use of British accents. Set in a world which could be described as half medieval, half Lord of the Rings, the award-wining fanatsy series has won a worldwide audience with its lavish production values. The show's cast consists of predominantly British actors including well known faces like Sean Bean, Charles Dance and MacKenzie Crook as well as newcomers Emilia Clarke, Richard Madden, Kit Harington and Natalie Dormer. Charles Dance (left) and Sean Bean (right) are among the many British actors to feature in HBO's hit fantasy series Game of Thrones, but the show has been lambasted by linguistic experts for its dodgy accents . And while the hotchpotch of regional accents on offer appear to have fallen on deaf ears in the U.S. they have begun to attract ridicule in the UK. In one terrible blunder four members of the same family - the Starks - are all heard speaking with different accents. Producers on the show, which is set in an ancient kingdom based on early Europe, have hired a growing army of famous and forgotten UK acting talent. Each episode enjoys a mammoth budget, similar to that of a Hollywood movie, but experts said they should have paid more attention to our diverse accents. The show's creators splashed out on constructing new languages called Dothraki and Valerian for the exotic Eastern kingdoms, but have let the Brit accents run wild. Professor Anthony Grant, Edge Hill . University Historical Linguistics and Language expert said the mistakes . are caused because Americans don't know any better. Brits Emilia Clarke (as Daenerys Targaryen) and Natalie Dormer (as Margaery Tyrell) both speak with southern accents in the show . He said: 'The accents on Game of Thrones are a complete mish-mash and it is the one big mistake they've made. 'Some actors are better at accents than others and it really shows on the show. 'They . should have had a dialect coach on set to ensure all the accents were . consistent - but the actors must have been told to 'sound as British as . you can, just not American.' 'When these actors audition for a role, they must show their ability to perform with a range of accents. 'The . American producers cannot hear the inconsistencies on the show's . British accents as they tend to be wowed by British accents, no matter . where they come from. 'Most of them haven't had much exposure to British brogues outside of the standard London or Home Counties accents. 'They . can't distinguish between people's speech from Liverpool, Edinburgh and . Sheffield - those accents will all sound the same to them. The show is set in a fantasy world which could be described . as half medieval, half Lord of the Rings . More Brits: Rose Leslie as Ygritte and Kit Harington are among the many young British actors in the series . 'The producers thought we'll get British actors and have lovely British accents, but they got a lot more than they bargained for. 'They have spent a lot of money on constructing the new Dothraki and High Valerian languages and no doubt the regional accents have come second to this. 'As long as it sounds exotic to them, the producers will be happy. 'It would be impossible for members of the same family, like the Starks, to have different accents unless one had been sent to live the other side of the country. 'It's more like a representation of life today where people travel and have partners from elsewhere.' Dr Dominic Watt, Senior Lecturer in Forensic Speech Science at York University added: 'TV producers use regional accents as a shorthand for creating characters. 'Stereotypes born out of accents are a method of giving the audience a quick way to indentify their backgrounds - but they're out of place in this context.' A HBO spokesman for Game of Thrones said the producers of the show 'declined to comment.' It isn't the first time an American production has been slammed for its misunderstanding of British accents. After starring in the 2010 production of Robin Hood, Hollywood hot head Russell Crowe famously stormed out of an interview with BBC Radio 4 after being accused of making the hero of Sherwood Forest sound a trifle Irish.","Show's cast consists of predominantly of actors from all over Britain .

"Nasa has returned some of the most stunning true-colour images of Saturn, showing the planet suspended in eternal beauty alongside its largest moon. The crystal-clear images were produced by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which has been circling Saturn for the last eight years. Titan is one of the most Earth-like bodies in the solar system and, even if it is 'just' a moon, it is bigger than the planet Mercury. The images also capture the changing hues of Saturn's northern and southern hemispheres as they pass from one season to the next. In many respects, Saturn's largest . moon, Titan, is one of the most Earth-like worlds we have found to date. With . its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a . frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before life began . pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Scroll down for video . Saturn as we generally see it: NASA's most detailed images yet (below) can show us the colour diversity as seasons sweep the planet . Amazing images: Titan, Saturn's largest moon, measures 3,200 miles, or 5,150 kilometers, across and is larger than the planet Mercury . Artist's concept: What Titan might look like from the surface - a rocky world with liquid lakes . Titan is of great interest to . scientists because it has a substantial, active atmosphere and complex, . Earth-like processes that shape its surface. The moon is enveloped by an orange haze of naturally produced photochemical smog that frustratingly obscured its surface prior to Cassini's arrival. Since 2004, the spacecraft's observations have taken the study of this unique world into a whole new dimension. Cassini has revealed that Titan's surface is shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane (the main component of natural gas), which forms clouds and occasionally rains from the sky as water does on Earth. Winds sculpt vast regions of dark, hydrocarbon-rich dunes that girdle the moon's equator and low latitudes. Volcanism may occur as well, but with liquid water as the lava. On its journey to Saturn, Cassini . carried the European-built Huygens probe. On Jan. 14, 2005, Huygens . achieved humankind's first landing on a body in the Outer Solar System . when it parachuted through Titan's murky skies. Huygens took measurements of . atmospheric composition and wind speeds during its decent, along with an . incredible series of images showing telltale patterns of erosion by . flowing liquid. The probe came to rest on what appeared to be a . floodplain, surrounded by rounded cobbles of water ice. As the Cassini Mission progresses, the . spacecraft will monitor Titan's atmosphere and surface for signs of . seasonal change. The spacecraft's radar and camera systems will continue . to peer through the haze, expanding our high resolution maps of the . surface. And scientists will eagerly await new data that could confirm . the presence of a liquid ocean beneath the giant moon's surface. The exploration of this amazing place . is just beginning. Frigid and alien, yet also remarkably similar to our . own planet, Titan is a new world – revealed before our very eyes by the . Cassini and Huygens spacecraft. Some of these views, such as those of the polar vortex, are only . possible because Cassini's newly inclined - or tilted - orbits allow . more direct viewing of the polar regions of Saturn and its moons. Upon Cassini's arrival at Saturn eight years ago, Saturn's northern winter hemisphere was an azure blue. Now . that winter is encroaching on the planet's southern hemisphere and . summer on the north, the color scheme is reversing: blue is tinting the . southern atmosphere and is fading from the north. Other images depict the newly discovered south polar vortex in the atmosphere of Titan, reported recently by Cassini scientists. Saturn in all its glory: This image, taken in October 2004, shows the full scale of the planet, including its shadow stretching across the rings . Cassini's . visible-light cameras have seen a concentration of yellowish haze in . the detached haze layer at the south pole of Titan since March . 27. Cassini's visual and . infrared mapping spectrometer spotted the massing of clouds around the . south pole as early as May 22 in infrared wavelengths. After . a June 27 flyby of the moon, Cassini released a dramatic image and . movie showing the vortex rotating faster than the moon's rotation . period. The four images being released today were acquired in May, June . and July of 2012. Scientists . are looking forward to seeing more of the same - new phenomena like . Titan's south polar vortex and changes wrought by the passage of time . and seasons - during the remainder of Cassini's mission. Carolyn . Porco, imaging team lead based at the Space Science Institute in . Boulder, Colo, said: 'Cassini has been in orbit now for the last eight . years, and despite the fact that we can't know exactly what the next . five years will show us, we can be certain that whatever it is will be . wondrous.' Amanda Hendrix, . deputy project scientist, based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in . Pasadena, California, said: 'It is so fantastic to experience, through . the instruments of Cassini, seasonal changes in the Saturn system. 'Some . of the changes we see in the data are completely unexpected, while some . occur like clockwork on a seasonal timescale. It's an exciting time to . be at Saturn.'

Saturn's rings obscure part of the moon Titan's colorful visage in this image from NASA's Cassini spacecraft.. If you look at the south pole, you can see a vortex - a mass of swirling gas around the pole in the atmosphere - that first appeared in Titan's atmosphere in 2012. The . northern part of the moon's atmosphere visible here includes the north . polar hood, a cap of haze looking slightly darker than the rest of the . atmosphere and seen near the top of the moon. Parts of the rings appear dark near . the center of this view because of the shadow cast by the planet. However, a sliver of illuminated Titan can be seen through the Cassini . Division in the rings near the middle of this darkness. This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ring plane. Images . taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to . create this natural color view. The images were obtained with the . Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 16, 2012, at a distance of . approximately 1.9 million miles (3 million kilometers) from Titan. Image scale is 11 miles (18 kilometers) per pixel on Titan. In many respects, Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is one of the most Earth-like worlds we have found to date. With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. The moon is enveloped by an orange haze of naturally produced photochemical smog that frustratingly obscured its surface prior to Cassini's arrival. Here, Cassini spacecraft looks toward the . night side of Titan and sees sunlight scattering through . the periphery of the moon's atmosphere and forming a ring of color. Titan's . north polar hood can be seen at the top of this view, and a hint of the . south polar vortex can be detected at the bottom. This view looks toward the . Saturn-facing side of Titan (3,200 miles, or 5,150 kilometers across). North on Titan is up and rotated 9 degrees to the right.

"Nine months on from his fatal drugs overdose, Philip Seymour Hoffman's partner, Mimi O'Donnell stepped out with their three children on Sunday as they spent the day in an autumnal New York City. Last seen in heart-wrenching and teary pictures at their father's funeral, the Oscar winner's son Cooper and daughters, Tallulah and Mimi skipped through Manhattan's affluent West Village neighborhood in high spirits. Their mother, Mimi, chatted away to a female friend while the children carried on ahead through the fashionable, leaf-strewn area of the city where they once lived with their superstar father in a $4.4 million apartment. Scroll down for video . Moving on... Philip Seymour Hoffman's partner Mimi O'Donnell enjoyed a family day out with children on Sunday in New York City's West Village nine months after his tragic death . With a shock of strawberry blond hair just like his much-missed father, Cooper, 10, led his sisters across the road while Tallulah and Mimi smiled and held hands. Hauntingly, it was just blocks away in February that Hoffman, 46, was found dead in the $10,000-a-month West Village apartment he was renting nearby, after he moved out of the family home following his relapse into addiction. The loving family seemed blissfully unconcerned during their afternoon outing through the West Village where they were regularly photographed with their famous father before his death from a cocktail of heroin, alcohol and prescription drugs. Mimi, who dated Hoffman from 1999 until just months before his passing, concealed her eyes behind a pair of sunglasses as she donned a casual all black ensemble. Happy: The late actor's  children Cooper, Tallulah and Willa Hoffman were in high spirits as they journeyed along . Hoffman, who won the Oscar for Captote, was remembered at an emotional funeral service in New York City in February attended by celebrity friends and his grief-stricken family. His lifeless body was discovered surrounded by bags of heroin and used syringes and was found by his personal assistant and fried on the morning of February 2. Hoffman had relapsed the year before and completed a stint to treat his addictions. Following his death in February, it was revealed that Hoffman rejected his accountant's suggestion he set aside money for his three children because he didn't want them to be 'trust fund' kids, according to court documents. Tragic:  Oscar Award winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman died aged 46 in February of a drug overdose . The spit of his father: Flamed haired Cooper, 11, beamed as he led the way for his two sisters . Little ladies: Tallulah and Willa stayed closed to their mother Mimi as they crossed the road . Loving unit: Willa, six,  leaned on her older brother Cooper as they waited to cross the road . In a July 18 filing in Manhattan Surrogate Court, the late actor's accountant David Friedman recalled conversations with Hoffman where the topic of a trust for his children was raised. He said Hoffman wanted his estimated $35 million fortune to go his longtime partner O'Donnell. According to the filing, Friedman said the Oscar-winning star treated O'Donnell 'in the same manner as if she were a spouse' as Hoffman told the accountant that he just didn't believe in marriage. At the time the court-appointed attorney said the actor's will should be approved by the court because there wasn't anything suspicious about it. Hoffman also said that he wanted his son to be raised in Manhattan, Chicago or San Francisco, an edict that was written before his daughters were born. In good company: Mimi, who dated Hoffman from 1999 until 2013,  was joined by a female companion . Coordinated family: Both O'Donnell and son Cooper donned casual ensembles made up of all black . Conversation starter: Mimi chatted away with her friend as Cooper appeared to listen on as well . How they were... Hoffman and Mimi O'Donnell with their son Cooper in December 2013 in New York (left) Tallulah, Willa and Hoffman in New York City in April of 2013 (right) Despite the turbulent final months of his relationship with O'Donnell, Hoffman remained close to his children, seeing them most days. He was also regularly spotted taking Cooper to basketball games. 'My spare time is really about hanging out with my kids,' Hoffman once told Us Weekly. 'If I'm free, a good chunk of that is going to be thinking about how to hang out with them.'","Oscar winner's children Cooper, Tallulah and Mimi walked through NYC .

"A New York Yankees ball boy may soon find himself a whole lot richer. The young man, whose name is still unknown, pocketed a foul ball hit by Derek Jeter last night during the baseball's stars final home game at Yankee Stadium, and some are saying the ball could fetch as much as $10,000. And while the ball boy, or girl, is expected to toss all foul balls into the crowd for the fans, there is no official rule that says they cannot keep the ball. Scroll down for video . Piece of history: A foul ball hit by Derek Jeter (above) at this last home game ever could be worth $10,000 . Foul?: The ball was actually kept by the ball boy (above) rather than given to a fan in the stands . It all happened when the Yankees took on the Baltimore Orioles and Jeter pulled a foul ball down the left field line in the bottom of the fifth inning. The young man cleanly fielded the grounder, held it in his glove, and then reached into his back pocket pulling out another ball and handing it off to a fan in the stands. It is uncertain if the boy kept the ball for himself, or if the Yankees asked those on the field to hold on to the balls for the sake of having Jeter memorabilia. The Yankees may have also wanted to avoid hysteria or fighting among fans for the ball. Handoff: The boy pulled a new ball out of his pocket (above) and kept Jeter's ball . Fair play: There is no rule that says a ball boy, or girl, can't keep a ball . If it is the former, it was one lucrative move for the man, as some are saying it could fetch up to $10,000. 'It’s a pretty great thing, I’d love to have it for our auction,' Kevin Bronson, director of acquisitions at Leland Sports Auction House, told ABC News. That being said, the young man is going to have to strike while the iron is hot. Celebration: Jeter's teammates lift him up after he hit a game winning walkoff RBI last night against the Baltimore Orioles . 'It’s worth the most it’s ever going to be worth last night,' said Bronson. 'As Jeter fades from the spotlight, so do prices.' No doubt making the ball even more valuable is how Jeter ended his last home game ever yesterday- with a walkoff RBI single. That's one epic way to go out. Jeter will finish up his career this weekend at Fenway Park, as the Yankees take on their longtime rivals, the Boston Red Sox.","A ball boy held on to a foul ball hit by Derek Jeter last night at Yankee Stadium .

"Leading psychologist Oliver James say 'extensive evidence' shows that CBT is a quick fix with no lasting benefits . People with mental health problems are victims of  a ‘scam’ therapy that is wasting vast sums of money, a leading psychologist has warned. They are being misled because the short-term fix offered by Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) does not have a lasting benefit, says Oliver James. The most popular of the ‘talking therapies’ CBT aims to help people manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave to become more positive. It is frequently recommended for people with problems ranging from anxiety and depression to eating disorders. In the short-term, 40 per cent of those who complete a course of CBT, typically five to 20 sessions of up to an hour, are said to have recovered. But ‘extensive evidence’ shows that two years on, depressed or anxious people who had CBT were no more likely to have recovered than those who had no treatment, said Mr James. He said: ‘As a treatment, rafts of studies have shown it to be ineffective in delivering long-term therapeutic benefits to patients with anxiety and depression. ‘While studies show that in the short-term - six to 12 months - patients who have received CBT are more likely to report themselves as ‘recovered’ compared to those who have received no treatment, these results are not sustained in the long-term. ‘CBT is largely ineffective for the majority of patients. It is in essence a form of mental hygiene. ‘However filthy the kitchen floor of your mind, CBT soon covers it with a thin veneer of ‘positive polish’. ‘Unfortunately, shiny services tend not to last. CBT fails to address the root cause of many people’s problems, which often stem from traumatic experiences during their childhood. The UK Government has pledged up to £400 million on treatment programmes which mostly use CBT and it is recommended as frontline NHS treatment for many mental health issues. Mr James, a chartered psychologist, author and broadcaster, delivered his argument to the CBT industry at the Limbus Critical Psychotherapy Conference in Devon this weekend. CBT, or Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, is a talking therapy. It has been proved to help treat a wide range of emotional and physical health conditions in adults, young people and children. CBT looks at how a person thinks about a situation and how this affects the way they act. In turn actions can affect how a person thinks and feels. The therapist and client work together in changing the client’s behaviours, or their thinking patterns, or both of these. He and other psychotherapists are calling on the Government and policymakers to refocus funding into alternative talking treatments, such as psychodynamic therapy, which focus on addressing the root cause of people’s cognitive problems. The NHS has been advised that CBT may be offered to patients with a range of conditions by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the guideline body. It is free on the NHS after referral by a GP but not available in all areas and there can be long waiting lists. The cost of private therapy sessions varies, but it is usually £40 - £100 a session. Many mental health groups welcome the shift in emphasis in recent years away from medication towards personalised therapy. But Mr James says research shows CBT is no more effective than placebo in treating anxiety or depression . He says proponents have ‘mis-sold’ the treatment to policymakers and the public, who are wasting their time. Mr James says CBT has been mis-sold to policymakers because it is cheap. He is campaigning for  treatments such as psychodynamic therapy - which focus  on addressing the root cause of people’s problems - to be made available instead . ‘CBT appeals to politicians and NICE because it is quick and cheap. ‘The therapies proven to work long-term, such as psychodynamic therapy, would not be so cheap because they require more sessions’ he said. But, he added: ‘Working as a psychotherapist, I rarely encounter patients who haven’t been subjected to CBT, which failed to help them.’ The British Association for Behavioural & Cognitive Psychotherapies was unavailable for comment.","Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is the most popular talking therapy .

"Scientists claim the rise of untreatable bacteria is one of the biggest health threats facing the world. To prevent minor infections killing people globally, researchers are in a race against time to develop new and better types of antibiotics. Now scientists in Switzerland believe they have found one solution to the problem in an unlikely place: the gray shag mushroom that grows on horse dung. Scientists in Switzerland believe they have found a substance that can lead to a new type of antibiotic in an unlikely place: the gray shag mushroom (pictured) The substance, known as copsin, has the same effect as traditional antibiotics, but belongs to a different type of biochemical family because it is a protein. The researchers led by Markus Aebi, a mycology professor at ETH Zurich, discovered the substance in the common inky cap mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea. Copsin belongs to the group of defensins, a class of small proteins produced by many organisms to combat microorganisms that cause disease. The human body also produces defensins to protect itself against infections. They have been found, for example, on the skin and in the mucous membranes. The gray shag mushroom grows on horse manure. It contains a substance known as copsin, The three-dimensional structure studied by ETH researchers shows the compact form of copsin on the left . For Professor Aebi, the main focus of this research project was not primarily on applications for the new substance. 'Whether copsin will one day be used as an antibiotic in medicine remains to be seen. This is by no means certain, but it cannot be ruled out either,' he says. The ETH professor is now looking at how fungi have used defensins and other naturally antibiotic substances for millions of years to protect themselves against bacteria - without becoming resistant. Scientists have created the first viable alternative to antibiotics, marking the next step in the fight against drug-resistant superbugs . Scientists have created the first viable alternative to antibiotics, marking the next step in the fight against drug-resistant superbugs. A small test study has found the new drug is effective at targeting the bacteria that causes MRSA. Researchers believe the likelihood of the bug developing a resistance to the new drug is 'very limited'. A version of the drug is already used in specialist creams to treat conditions including acne, eczema, rosacea and skin irritations. Dutch biotech firm Micreos claims Staphefekt is the first endolysin - a bacteria-killing enzyme - available for use on human skin. While targeting MRSA and other strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics, the drug's make up means it leaves 'good' bacteria unharmed - important in the case of long-term use. The firm unveiled its discovery at the EuroSciCon meeting, Antibiotics Alternatives for the New Millenium, in London last week. 'Fungi have internal instructions on how to use these substances without resulting in selection of resistant bacteria. How to decode these instructions is an intriguing problem for basic research,' explains Professor Aebi. In addition to being used as an antibiotic in medicine, it may also be possible to use copsin in the food industry as well. This is because copsin kills many pathogens including Listeria, a type of bacteria that can cause severe food poisoning and is therefore feared, especially in the production of non-heat treated foodstuffs such as raw milk cheeses and dried meats.","Substance, known as copsin, can be found on the gray shag mushroom .

"If you’ve ever owned an iPhone and used iMessage, but switched to a non-Apple phone, you could be missing out on texts from friends and family. Once iMessage is enabled, Apple routes messages from other iPhones through it. However, this can continue even when a number is switched to an Android phone, without access to the service. As a result, if anyone sends an iMessage to that number it doesn't get converted to a text, and ultimately ends up lost in the ether. But now Apple has released a tool that will help people deregister their number from iMessage, or disable the service, to stop this from happening. When a person registers an iPhone, their number is typically linked to iMessage. When they then swap to a new device, these messages are not always converted to text, and become lost. The tool (pictured) lets previous iPhone owners enter their phone number to deregister it from the service . The tool, first spotted by a Reddit user, lets current or previous iPhone owners enter their phone number to deregister it from iMessage. They are then sent a six-digit code to confirm they want to remove it. Alternatively, people who still own an iPhone and are selling it, or want to simply switch the service off, can click Settings, Messages and Turn iMessage off. If you still have the iPhone you were using before you switched, transfer your SIM card temporarily back into the iOS device. Make sure the phone is connected to a network. Click Settings, Messages and turn iMessage off. If you no longer have the iPhone, open Apple's new tool. Select the correct country from the drop-down menu and type in the number. Click 'Send code'. Enter the six-digit code that is sent to that number into the box below, and select Submit. When purchasing an iPhone, a number is typically linked to the firm’s iMessage service upon registration. When a message is sent between enabled iOS devices, Apple sends it as an iMessage - rather than as a text. iMessages are sent using a web connection, rather than a network connection. But, when a person switches their number to a new phone, such as an Android, that particular number can remain linked to iMessage. When an iOS user then sends that mobile number a message, Apple can end up routing it through its web service. But without access to iMessages, the recipient doesn’t receive it unless the sender resends it as a text. Previously, the only solution was to deregister the old device completely from their Apple accounts. The bug can also affect iPads that have a 3G connection and use a number. In May, Apple said it was addressing bugs within its iMessaging system that caused text messages to become lost when the recipient switched to a non-Apple phone.

Adrienne Moore claimed the company failed to disclose its knowledge of the problem. The issue does not appear to affect all previous iPhone users, but Apple issued a statement that it had ‘fixed a server-side iMessage bug which was causing an issue for some users,’ and was working on an additional fix for future software updates. This latest tool offers such a fix.","The official Apple tool was spotted by a Reddit user .

"Since AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd's controversial arrest, local businesses in his adopted home of Tauranga have resorted to taping messages on the door of his personal airport hangar to contact him for money owed.

"One in every 13 people on the planet check Facebook the moment they wake up - leading to reports of Facebook addiction and social anxiety. And, according to one researcher, the fault lies with the little red notification icons and the numbers that litter the social network. Software expert Benjamin Grosser recently created a plug-in to remove all metrics, including likes and share numbers, from the site – and discovered that their removal improved a user’s enjoyment. Scroll down for video . Software expert Benjamin Grosser recently created a browser plug-in to automatically remove all metrics from Facebook, including likes, shares, comments, number of events, group notifications, friend requests and numbers, message count and more. The vast number of metric is shown ringed in red . The browser plug-in can be installed to Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It automatically removes all metrics from the site, including likes, shares, comments, number of events, group notifications, friend requests and numbers, message count and more. ‘Over the last few decades, we have become increasingly subject to mechanisms of measurement, a constant push to assess performance from a quantitative perspective,’ said Mr Grosser from the School of Art and Design, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Grosser. ‘Within the context of Facebook, however, this culture of audit plays out differently. Mr Grosser said that over the past decade, web users have become increasingly measured and audited. Typically, this self-surveillance involved either a few watching the many, known as panoptic surveillance, or the many watching the few, dubbed synopticon. Instead today’s social network-based culture of audit is more similar to ‘the many watching the many,’ where everyone watches everyone else.’ Mr Grosser said this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon. ‘While one Facebook user can’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment, they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment,’ said Mr Grosser. ‘Their Timeline is open to all of their friends, and in many cases to all of the world. Therefore, he said users need to appear to have multiple likes, shares and friends to look more popular. ‘It is no longer a form of self-surveillance where the few watch the many, or the many watching the few. Instead, today’s social network-based culture of audit is more similar to ‘the many watching the many,’ where everyone watches everyone else.’ Mr Grosser said that this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon. ‘While one Facebook user can’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment, they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment,’ continued Mr Grosser. ‘Their Timeline is open to all of their friends, and in many cases to all of the world. Therefore, he said users need to appear to have multiple likes, shares and friends to look more popular. This need for numbers is also influenced by how Facebook’s News Feed is organised. The more a user interacts with likes, comments, and other objects, the higher the News Feed algorithm rates those posts, and thus shows them on the news feeds of their friends. More interaction leads to more visibility. Visibility therefore becomes a prerequisite for getting more likes, shares, and friends. Mr Grosser discovered that Facebook is designed as an ‘endless interaction loop’ which draws on the user’s need for more likes, shares and comments. A user clicks the red number to read the notification, but this causes the metric to disappear. The left-hand image shows how likes and share metrics appear. The right-hand image reveals how the site looks after the Demetricator plug-in has been enabled. Research has revealed metrics create an 'interaction loop of checking', similar to compulsive behaviour, but this is manageable when numbers are removed . Similarly, this image reveals how the site looks when the metrics are removed, without removing the names or other details from posts. By removing the metrics, Mr Grosser found that people were less competitive, anxious and preoccupied with the numbers . The quickest way to then get new notifications is to post statuses or comments that attract attention, or by adding friends. And the more content and posts a user makes, the higher the potential for likes, shares and comments. ‘This interaction loop of checking, reading, and generating resembles compulsive behaviour in the way that it sets up a cycle that can never be satisfied,’ said Mr Grosser. Mr Grosser said metrics on the social network end up homogenising Facebook users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number, and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value. Equally, individuals become lumped together as a group, because they Liked the same product or page. And by making people all appear the same, they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments. ‘The user’s desire for more craves higher notification metrics, but the system’s design clears those metrics every time the user checks them. ‘In the case of notifications, metrics want more attention from the site’s users.’ He continued that these numbers also homogenise Facebook users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number, and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value. Equally, individuals become lumped together as a group, because they liked the same product or page. And by making people all appear the same, they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments. By removing the metrics, Mr Grosser found that people were less competitive, anxious and preoccupied with the numbers. One user said: ‘[Facebook is] so much more enjoyable without constant (subconscious) pressure to compare when numbers are involved,’ while another said ‘[Notifications] simply became a nervous addiction for me, inadvertently. ‘But, that all changed when I downloaded the add-on. ‘No more ridiculous liking stats, no more mounds of notifications or the number of comments on other’s statuses. 'It added a Zen element to the entire format, and I finally feel at ease.’ Mr Grosser’s paper ‘What do metrics want? How quantification prescribes social interaction on Facebook’, is published in the journal Computational Culture.","Facebook Demetricator is a browser plug-in for Chrome, Firefox and Safari .

"Downing Street has backed plans to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee - with the three main parties voting on the matter on Tuesday . The abolition of the BBC licence fee came a step closer yesterday when Downing Street backed plans to decriminalise non-payment. All three main parties will vote on Tuesday to end the threat of prison sentences for fee dodgers. More than 180,000 viewers – almost 3,500 a week – appeared in court in 2012 accused of watching TV without a licence. Most of them were fined and handed a criminal record. Every year around 70 people end up in jail. Ministers are supporting an amendment to the Deregulation Bill that would withdraw the criminal sanctions when the BBC’s charter comes up for renewal in 2016. A Labour source said the party was open to the idea as long as it did not hit the BBC’s £3.5billion annual income. ‘Nobody wants to see people going to prison for non-payment if they can’t afford the fee,’ a source said. Downing Street’s announcement follows campaigning by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen. He wants civil penalties to replace the jail terms imposed for refusing to pay the £145.50 fee. The amendment would delete references in the 2003 Communications Act to licence fee evaders being ‘guilty of an offence’. Instead those who refuse to pay will be ‘liable to a civil penalty’. The amendment has been backed by more than 150 MPs including former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell, former Tory shadow home secretary David Davis and Labour former health secretary Frank Dobson. Mr Bridgen’s amendments would give ministers powers to impose ‘civil monetary penalties’. Fines could be levied like parking tickets with offenders paying online rather than facing court. Last night Mr Bridgen claimed decriminalisation heralded the beginning of the end for the licence fee. ‘This is a warning to the BBC that the future of the licence fee is now on the table,’ he said. ‘I expect decriminalisation will be in place by the end of 2016. The public and the Commons will no longer stand for it. Ultimately you will see the BBC having to adopt different mechanisms to collect money.’ Insiders say the BBC will be expected to charge overseas viewers more for watching iPlayer and to roll it out to other countries. It is currently only available in Western Europe. The BBC would also be expected to raise funds from its commercial arm. Ministers are supporting a amendment to the Deregulation Bill which would withdraw criminal sanctions when the BBC¿s charter comes up for renewal in 2016 . The corporation has admitted that up to 2 per cent of households exploit a loophole that enables them to watch ‘catch-up’ programmes online for free. With 26.4million households in the UK, as many as 528,000 could be doing so. Ministers will now launch a review of the penalties for non-payment of the TV licence, which will feed into negotiations with BBC bosses after the 2015 election. Solicitor General Oliver Heald has signed a joint amendment with Mr Bridgen that will require Culture Secretary Maria Miller to carry out a review of the sanctions, lasting up to a year, within three months of the Deregulation Bill being passed. The findings will be presented to the BBC Trust as well as both Houses of Parliament. 'Higher evasion': The BBC says that if it is not allowed to prosecute people, services may have to close . A Downing Street source said: ‘This would give us the power to be able to decriminalise non-payment after the election. There’s a quite compelling case.’ Both Lib Dem and Labour officials said they are expected to vote it through unopposed when the Bill reaches the final day of its committee stage on Tuesday. A source close to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said: ‘We’ve come to a common view with the Conservatives to pass this.’ The BBC Trust said any change should be part of the charter renewal process. A BBC spokesman said: 'These amendments make clear that the decriminalisation issue will be reviewed once the bill has past and no decisions will be taken until Charter review.'","Ministers supporting change to Deregulation Bill which would withdraw criminal sanction for fee dodgers when BBC charter is renewed in 2016 .

"A 15-year-old whose mother was killed in the 2004 terrorist bombing in Jakarta, will have her Australian passport renewed after prime minister Tony Abbott personally ordered it himself. Mr Abbott read of Manuela Musu's struggle to obtain the passport, which her mother had been collecting from the Australian embassy in Jakarta when it was bombed, in the Daily Telegraph on Monday when he took action, News Corp Australia reports. A spokesperson for the prime minister told the publication: 'The Prime Minister instructed his staff to work with DFAT to resolve the matter as quickly as possible. Manuela Musu's, whose mother Eva was killed in the Bali bombing of the Australian embassy bombing in 2004, has been struggling to receive her passport for the last month, despite her biological father being a citizen . Prime Minister Tony Abbott fast-tracked her passport after reading of the 15-year-old's story in the Daily Telegraph on Monday. It will be issued in the coming days according to Mr Abbott's spokesperson . 'Ms Musu's application is currently being processed and the passport will be issued in the coming days.' Manuela was five-years-old when the bombing occurred and was herself severely injured in the blast. She was one of 200 people injured and her mother, Eva, was one of the 11 people killed in the tragedy. The teenager, who currently lives in Italy with her step-father, told the Daily Telegraph earlier this week that she had spent the last month struggling to renew her passport. Manuela was five-years-old when the bombing occurred. She was severely injured. This iconic image shows her being carried from the rubble by a stranger, just after the blast . The publication reported that Foreign Affairs had required the teenager to prove that her mother had died before they issued her with a new passport. The death certificate was never provided to the family, according to her step-father, while the Indonesian government informed them they had misplaced it. The reason why the certificate was required remains unknown, as Manuela's biological father, Dave Norman, is an Australian citizen. The 15-year-old said she wants to travel to Australia once her schooling finished, saying she hoped to find a job in the hospitality industry.

"Shane Kelly, 10, ran away from home because he wanted to play computer games - sparking an £8,000 police search  - before he was found in his shed . A 10-year-old boy sparked a huge police search involving a helicopter and almost 20 officers after he ran off because he wanted to play computer games, before he was found hiding in the garden shed of his home 12 hours later. Shane Kelly ran away from his mother and their home in Tyseley, Birmingham, after she told him he had to go to school instead of playing computer games. His disappearance led to widespread panic as 17 officers were deployed to search streets and even began looking in rubbish bins to find the child. Messages were sent out on Twitter to try and locate the boy while members of the community also helped with the search. Around 17 police officers were involved  and the West Midlands police helicopter - which costs about £700 an hour - was deployed. The child was found around 12 hours later sitting in the garden shed of his home. The police operation to find him is believed to have cost £8,000. His mother, Jackie Burke, 36, said: 'He was hiding in the shed in the garden. 'I don't know how he managed to avoid the police, he must have gone from shed to shed. 'I'm just so relieved he was found. A family member found him while I was at Stechford police station worried sick. 'He ran off because he was rebelling about going to school. He wanted to stay at home and play computer games. 'But he is not in any trouble, I love him.' The 10-year-old  ran away from his mother as they walked to nearby Holy Souls Catholic Primary School at about 9.20am on Friday. 'He had been off for two days as he hadn't been very well, he complained that he had a bad stomach,' added Ms Burke. 'I said he had to go in to school and he was shouting back at me. As we got to the end of the road he ran off. Members of the community and the police helicopter were involved in the search for the missing 10-year-old . Shane disappeared from his family home in Tyseley but was found hiding in the garden shed 12 hours later . 'His dad lives across the road so I thought he was going there, but he carried on running.' After his disappearance residents were so worried that a group met at Tyseley Working Men's Club to join the search as night fell. It was not until shortly after 9pm, following the widespread police search, that Shane was eventually found. A West Midlands Police spokesman tweeted on Friday: 'Shane has just been found. He's home and being checked over. Great news and a huge relief.' 'Thank you to absolutely everyone who has helped us in our search for the missing ten-year-old from Tyseley today.'","Shane Kelly, 10, ran away because he wanted to play computer games instead of go to school in Birmingham, and his mother reported him missing .

"Smoking cannabis every day warps key structures of the brain, a scientific study suggests. Regular use of the drug seems to shrink the brain’s ‘grey matter’ - the cells that crunch information - according to head scans of heavy drug users. The wiring of the brain – the ‘white matter’ that connects different parts - grows to compensate for the loss of the vital cells, scientists found. But eventually that also breaks down, impairing a drug users’ ability to use and react to information. Scroll down for video . Regular cannabis use appears to shrink the brain's 'grey matter' -  the cells that crunch information - according to scientists at the universities of Texas and New Mexico . The brain scan study is one of the first to investigate the drug’s long-term neurological impact in living people. The findings add to a growing weight of evidence that suggests cannabis is more harmful than legalisation campaigners would have us believe. It comes after a review of 20 years of cannabis research, published last month by a professor at King’s College London, revealed that one in six teenagers who use cannabis become dependent on the drug, as do one in 10 adults. That review also suggested that cannabis use in teenagers doubles the risk of developing psychotic disorders including schizophrenia. The authors of the new study, from the universities of Texas and New Mexico, warn that people who take the drug in heavy quantities for prolonged periods are likely to suffer damaging effects. A definitive 20-year study into the effects of long-term cannabis use has demolished the argument that the drug is safe. Cannabis is highly addictive, causes mental health problems and opens the door to hard drugs, the study found. The paper by Professor Wayne Hall, a drugs advisor to the World Health Organisation, builds a compelling case against those who deny the devastation cannabis wreaks on the brain. Professor Hall found: . Examining brain scans, the scientists found that chronic marijuana users - who smoked an average of three times a day - had smaller average volumes of grey matter in the orbitofrontal cortex, the part of the brain involved in mental processing and decision making. The cannabis users were also seen to have more ‘white matter’ - the connections between cells which affect how the brain learns and functions. The researchers suspect that those extra connections are forged as the brain tries to compensate for the lack of crucial grey matter. But even those extra connections were seen to break up within six to eight years under prolonged cannabis abuse, they found. Dr Sina Aslan from the University of Texas said: ‘What’s unique about this work is that it combines three different magnetic resonance imaging techniques to evaluate different brain characteristics. ‘The results suggest increases in connectivity, both structural and functional that may be compensating for grey matter losses. ‘Eventually, however, the structural connectivity or “wiring” of the brain starts degrading with prolonged marijuana use.’ The team studied MRI scans of the brains of 48 adult cannabis users aged 20 to 36 who were compared with a group of 62 non-users. The orbitofrontal cortex region of the brain, where the biggest differences in cannabis users’ brains was seen, is strongly linked to empathy - the ability to sense other people’s feelings. Neuroscientists believe damage to the orbitofrontal cortex may underpin many cases of personality disorder and psychopathy. The researchers found that the effect differed markedly depending on the age they started smoking and the number of years they continued to abuse the drug. The earlier someone started smoking cannabis, the greater the structural change to the brain and the larger the growth in white matter connections. This may explain why some chronic cannabis users sometimes appear to be coping normally, effectively masking the damage to their brain, the scientists said. Examining brain scans, the scientists found that chronic marijuana users - who smoked an average of three times a day - had smaller average volumes of grey matter, pictured on an MRI scan in light blue and green, in the orbitofrontal cortex, the part of the brain involved in mental processing and decision making . But after six to eight years of continually taking cannabis the increases in structural wiring declined, they found. The scientists said that because their study represented a simple snapshot of users’ brains, and did not monitor them over time, they could not be certain that the damage was directly caused by the drug. While the statistical picture they built up suggests that the drug abuse is linked to the structure of the brain, to be absolutely sure they more research is needed, they said. Co-author Dr Francesca Filbey, also from Texas, said: ‘We have seen a steady increase in the incidence of marijuana use since 2007. ‘However, research on its long-term effects remains scarce - despite the changes in legislation surrounding marijuana and the continuing conversation surrounding this relevant public health topic. ‘While our study does not conclusively address whether any or all of the brain changes are a direct consequence of marijuana use, these effects do suggest that these changes are related to age of onset and duration of use.’ UK drugs law has been the subject of much debate in recent years. The Labour government downgraded the drug to Class C in 2004 – meaning officers did not normally arrest those caught with the drug - but reversed their decision within five years, returning it to Class B status. Celebrities including Russell Brand, Richard Branson and Sting have called for it to be decriminalised, as has Professor David Nutt, the government’s former drugs advisor.","Scientists at the universities of Texas and New Mexico found the drug does warp key structures in the brain .

"Two schoolgirls survived being buried alive when a section of cliff collapsed on them as they walked on a beach. The friends were saved by a group of three men who dug them out with their bare hands after a 10-year-old boy raised the alarm. The girls are believed to have been trying to climb the 30ft tall shallow sandy cliff face when it suddenly collapsed at Hemsby beach, Norfolk. Rescue: Kenny Chaney, 66, who helped to dig out the schoolgirls after a section of cliff collapsed on them at Hemsby beach, Norfolk . One girl aged about 12 was buried up to her neck at the base of the cliff while her nine-year-old friend was trapped up to her chest six feet up. The incident happened around four miles away from where Paige Anderson, 15, was buried when a tunnel she was digging collapsed last August. Retired fisherman Kenny Chaney, 66, and two holidaymakers frantically dug the girls out after they were buried on Good Friday. The coastguard and fire service were alerted but the girls were dug out before they arrived. The girls are thought to have been staying at a nearby holiday park. They were playing alone on the beach when around 30 tonnes of sand collapsed. Mr Chaney, who was metal detecting nearby, said: 'They were very lucky not to have been killed. They could easily have suffocated in the sand if it had gone over their heads. 'A family were apparently walking along the beach and saw the cliff coming down. They must have heard the girls screaming and went over to help. 'I didn’t hear or see it happen, but a boy aged about ten in this family group ran to get me and said ""Two girls have been buried in an avalanche"". 'I raced over to help these two other men. We were all digging at the sand with our hands to get them out. 'I had a little spade with me, but I didn’t want to risk using it in case I injured them. It was a difficult job because more sand was pouring down the cliff as we dug the sand out from around them. Rescue: The girls are believed to have been clambering up the sandy cliff face, which is around 30ft tall, when it fell in on them . 'The girls were panicking and freaking out. They didn’t know if they were going to get out alive. One girl was buried up to her neck and the other up to her chest. 'I was worried that the whole lot was going to come down on all of us. It was pretty vertical there and there’s a lot of weight in it. We were all drawing out the sand with our bare hands. 'It felt a long while when I kept digging and the sand kept collapsing in. I just put my two hands together and kept scooping it out. 'They were very lucky they didn’t get completely buried or nobody would have seen them.' Mr Chaney said the girls appeared ‘deeply shocked’, but had no other apparent injury. He said: 'We lay them down on the beach after we pulled them out. They were both completely freaking out.' An adult turned up a short while later who is believed to be one of their fathers. Three fire engines, two ambulances and local lifeboat men arrived on the scene just minutes after the terrified girls had been pulled from the sand. They did not need hospital treatment. Ross Hewitt, coxswain of Hemsby Lifeboat, issued a warning about the dangers of playing around cliffs. He said: 'The major risk is death. Luckily for the girls, there was someone on the beach, but apart from them there was nobody else. 'They could have been stuck there for who knows how long. 'It’s an important message we’ve got to get out and we will be speaking to the council about getting warning signs by the cliffs. It’s something I feel is lacking. We want to keep the beach busy and keep it safe.'","'The girls were panicking and freaking out. They didn't know if they were going to get out alive'

"Mystery continues to surround the origin of the 100-year-old fragments of rubber that have been washing up on the shores of Britain and northern Europe for the last two years. Last week, conservationists cleared more than 100 rubber sheets, two rolls of rubber, three rubber ingots and several tablets from Chesil Beach in Dorset. Some theorists believe the pieces could date back to the Titanic - and may have risen to the water's surface after being contained for more than a century in the lost wreckage of the ship - which sunk in April 1912. Scroll down for video . Discovery: Izzy Imset, a local dive shop operator at Chesil Beach in Dorset, found this collection washed up on the shore . Most of the pieces are engraved with the name Tjipetir, an early 20th century rubber plantation in west Java, Indonesia. And their perfectly-preserved quality is alarming environmentalists and sparking fears over why supposedly biodegradable materials have remained completely intact. The rubber blocks and sheets are in such fine condition that they could have come from a ship that had just sunk. But the material they are made from was popularly used around a century ago. Conservationist Steve Trewhella said it is worrying that the pieces, some about one metre long, are in such good condition considering the rubber is meant to be biodegradable. The pieces are made from gutta percha, a form of latex made from the sap of a tropical tree of the same name.

Other sheets found washed ashore are marked 'Senawang' which was also an early 20th century rubber plantation in Asia. Since perfectly-preserved pieces of 100-year-old rubber began to wash up on shores around northern Europe, several theories have been put forward to explain their mysterious appearance: . Similar pieces have washed up on beaches in Cornwall, Jersey, Normandy in France, Holland and Germany and there is a Facebook group, called Tjipetir Mystery, dedicated to the mysterious rubber. One wild theory is that the pieces could have come from the Titanic. Gutta percha tablets were listed on the famous ship's manifest before it sank on April 15, 1912, but there is no evidence these pieces would have come from the Titanic wreck. Another possibility is that they came from a Second World War cargo ship on it's way from Asia to England. But as the cargo is valuable, the name of the ship will not be revealed until the salvage operation is complete. Mr Trewhella said: 'It's a bit of a mystery. What we do know is that the rubber came from this plantation in Indonesia 100 years ago and it was destined for Europe and various parts of the world, but we have no idea what it would have been used for. Tjipetir is the name of an early 20th century rubber plantation in Indonesia (pictured) 'This was before plastic existed and gutta percha was used for a variety of products from the soles of shoes to insulation for early telegraph cables. Dubbed the 'unsinkable' ship, the Titanic famously struck an iceberg and sank in under three hours on April 15, 1912. Of the 2,224 on board, 1,517 passengers and crew perished. It lay unseen on the ocean floor for decades, until 1985, when an American-French expedition identified its final resting place 329 miles south-east of Newfoundland. The wreck, which was split into two sections 2,000ft apart, has now been the focus of research by scientists and historians for 25 years. 'There is a ship that went down off the Isle of Scilly a hundred years ago that we think it could be. 'Some people have speculated that it could be from the Titanic, which was carrying this product when it sank. 'In reality it seems quite unlikely but we do get objects washing up from as far as north America. 'It could be that a shipwreck is gradually disintegrating, and as the hold is becoming more exposed the cargo floats to the surface and washes ashore. 'Some of the pieces have goose barnacles on them which indicates this rubber has been floating on the surface for some time as they only attach to flotsam on the ocean surface. 'The thing we find most worrying is that this is biodegradable rubber and here it is, 100 years later, in near perfect condition. It is astonishing that this product has remained intact for so long. Goose barnacles found on one of the rubber mats washed up suggests it had been floating on the surface for some time as they only attach to flotsam on the ocean surface . Washed up: Seaweed and flotsam can be seen riding a wave at Chesil beach in Dorset . 'It still looks as good as the day it was made which raises concerns about the litter we are making now. 'Scientists and various organisations make assumptions about how long things will take to break down but they don't really know.

"Showing public executions, corpses being devoured by wild animals and the bombing of a hospital, it’s not exactly your typical children’s film. But the latest instalment of The Hunger Games phenomenon has been handed a 12A classification – meaning it can be watched by under-12s as long as they are accompanied by an adult. As a glamorous Jennifer Lawrence took to the red carpet for the film’s London premiere last night, critics questioned whether the British Board of Film Classification’s decision was appropriate, warning that the graphic scenes in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 could ‘normalise’ violence and ‘traumatise’ children. Scroll down for video . Critics have warned that the graphic scenes in the latest Hunger Games film could 'normalise' violence . The film, released on November 20, is the third in the wildly popular series based on the children’s books by Suzanne Collins, which have sold 80million copies. They have been so successful that there are plans for a stage show in 2016, and the first two films grossed £1billion at the box office. But both also caused controversy for their 12A ratings, with some parents claiming their children had been so distressed that they had to leave the cinema early. While this instalment contains fewer acts of violence, the scenes of death and destruction that it does have are some of the most disturbing in the franchise – including the aftermath of a firebomb with heaps of corpses twisted among each other. Protesters are also shown being hooded, forced to their knees and shot in the head. The films have caused controversy for their 12A ratings with some parents claiming it left their children distressed . Scenes such as these have fuelled debate about whether 12A classifications give enough protection to young people and enough guidance for parents. Yesterday Pippa Smith of the Safer Media campaign said: ‘These are not things you would want children to see. It normalises violence.’ Vivienne Pattison of Mediawatch UK added: ‘There’s nothing to stop you taking a four-year-old to see it. I think it’s really worrying that films which, several years ago, would have been a 15 are now being given lower ratings.’ The BBFC said it would not comment on a film that has not been released.","Critics questioned whether British Board of Film Classification's decision was appropriate .

"New Rail Minister Suresh Prabhu is known for his efficient administration . Known for his efficient administration, new Rail Minister Suresh Prabhu has given himself a three-year target to turn around the fortunes of the country’s largest transporter. Until Sunday, the PMO was virtually holding the reins of railways in the absence of an ‘effective’ minister. The administrative machinery also did nothing to realise the goals set by PM Narendra Modi. Besides ensuring safety and providing quality amenities to passengers, Prabhu’s biggest challenge will be getting the derailed railways back on a sound financial track. And to achieve that, the most important tasks on his mind will be boosting foreign investment in key infrastructure projects and realising the potential of PPP projects. The minister admits that all is not well in the Rail Bhavan. At the same time, Prabhu promises: “Within next three years, I will turnaround the Railways in a way that it will become an example of service with high output and efficiency.’’ Prabhu knows that his main area of delivery will be expediting stuck projects for which foreign investment is most necessary. Modi has put construction of eight high-speed corridors and semi high-speed corridors as the top priorities to put the Indian Railways in the fast lane. “Our two focus areas will be customer service and railway safety,” Prabhu said. “We should be part of the solution and not become a part of the problem.’’ The buzz is that Prabhu has the mandate from the PMO to cleanse the rot set in the Railway Board functioning. A complete Board restructuring, decentralisation in operational functioning and more powers to zonal offices in day-to-day operations are something one can expect in the next few months.","Suresh Prabhu has a three-year target to revamp India's railways .

"They are admired for their incredible ability to hover in mid-air and to beat their wings at up to 200 times a second. Now, a new study has uncovered more if the hummingbird’s secrets. Researchers have discovered the migration patterns of hummingbirds and say they can live for just over a decade – up to five times as long as previously thought. Researchers have discovered the migration patterns of hummingbirds and say they can live for just over a decade – up to five times as long as previously thought. Here, a female Black-chinned hummingbird is captured and tagged so that researchers will be able to learn more about here migration habits . For the last decade, experts have been placing tiny numbered bands on the legs of birds, enabling researchers to identify a creature - and its vital statistics - when it is recaptured. The exercise has so far revealed astonishing migrations, with one Rufous hummingbird tagged in Florida showing up six months later more than 3,500 miles (5,630km) away in southeast Alaska. Experts are not sure if the bird made the long trip in one go or if it stopped off along the way. Some birds have even been discovered wintering in areas where temperatures drop below 18°C (0°F). ‘We're learning a lot about hummingbirds through banding we never would have learned otherwise,’ said Bruce Peterjohn, chief of the bird banding laboratory for the US Geological Survey's Patuxent Wildlife Research Centre in Laurel, Maryland. Since the 1990s, experts have been placing tiny numbered bands on the legs of birds to monitor them.The exercise has revealed astonishing migrations, with one Rufous hummingbird tagged in Florida showing up six months later more than 3,500 miles (5,630km) away in southeast Alaska. A Calliope hummingbird is pictured . Bird banding or ringing is the process of attaching a small, individually numbered metal or plastic tag to the leg or wing of a wild bird. This enables the individual bird to be identified should it later be recaptured or recovered. It's common to take measurements - such as fat content, age, sex, wing and tail - during the capture for ringing. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population studies, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. It's thought that the earliest attempt to mark a bird was made by Roman officers between 218 and 201BC when they sent a crow by a besieged garrison. One of the soldiers tied a thread on the bird's leg to send a reply. Hummingbirds are protected in the US under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and permits are need to capture them. They live in the Americas as far north as Alaska and as far south as Chile and are known to migrate to the southern states, Mexico and Panama for winter, with some birds based in warmer locations staying put instead. Mr Peterjohn said that there are 225 hummingbird banders in the US and around half of them are considered experts – a huge increase from around a dozen in the mid-1990s. Fred Bassett, 68, was among the early banders and caught 1,900 of the tiny creatures in Idaho last summer. He said: ‘They know exactly what's going on. They know humans are supposed to put up the feeders. They consider us to be their personal servants.’ Mr Bassett flew fighter jets before retiring from the US Air Force in 1988 and finds hummingbird flight amazing. ‘I envy them greatly for being able to fly like that - how they can manoeuvre, from 0 to 50mph (0 to 80 kph) about 10 feet ( three metres),’ he said. Hummingbird beat at about 70 times per second in normal fight and about 200 times per second during a high speed dive. The metal bands – which the banders prepare themselves – have become more advanced, as have traps and techniques used to collect the information gathered. Some birds have even been discovered wintering in areas where temperatures drop below 18°C (0°F). Here, a make Calliope hummingbird (pictured left) and a male Black-chinned hummingbird (right) are studied . Hummingbirds are the only birds to hover in the air by relying on their strength alone. In August, scientists found that it is the ratio of the bird’s wing length to its width that makes them so efficient. The discovery is helping experts compete with 42 million years of natural selection to build helicopters that are increasingly efficient, which could match the performance of the best hummingbird. David Lentink, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University in California, tested wings from 12 different species of hummingbirds, which he sourced from museums. He positioned them on a machine used to test the aerodynamics of helicopter blades - so they spun around like man-made blades. Together with his team, he used cameras to capture airflow around the wings and measured the drag and the lift force they exerted at different speeds and angles. Professor Lentink’s team used the same machine to test the rotor blades from a ProxDynamics Black Hornet autonomous micro helicopter, which is one of the most efficient on the market and is used by the UK’s army in Afghanistan. They found that the micro-helicopter's blades are as efficient at hovering as the average hummingbird. But while the micro-copter's blades kept pace with the middle-of-the-pack hummingbird wings, they could not keep up with the most efficient hummingbird's wing. The wings of Anna's hummingbird - a species common throughout the West Coast of the U.S. – were found to be about 27 per cent more efficient than the man-made micro-copter blades. Jessica Pollock, a research biologist with the Intermountain Bird Observatory at Boise State University in Idaho said: ‘You need to have a standardised protocol. You just can't be willy-nilly.’ Her group last year caught a record 635 hummingbirds, including 105 recaptures, during nine capture days between May and August on private property located about a mile (1.6km) south of Idaho City. Key to capturing hummingbirds, she said, is to go where there is an established feeding site put up by humans that has had time to attract generations of hummingbirds. ‘They'll bring their kids, and their baby hummingbirds will bring theirs the next year,’ Dr Pollock said. ‘So you just get more and more every year.’ Carl Rudeen, another hummingbird bander in Idaho, captured a record 768 hummingbirds in the state. He's discovered that a new species of hummingbird - the Anna's hummingbird - is starting to move into Idaho. ‘This year we caught two juveniles in August, the first documentation of juveniles in Idaho.’ His theory is that the species, which thrives in urban environments with human helpers, is moving from coastal areas to Idaho expecting to find hummingbird feeders at the ready. While the information has shed light on hummingbird habits, it has also generated new questions. Mr Peterjohn said that it's unclear whether hummingbirds on their long migrations fly hundreds of miles at a time and make long layovers to refuel, or if they are making relatively short 30-mile (48km) flights. The longevity of hummingbirds is also unknown, with Mr Peterjohn predicting birds in their teens will likely start showing as the banding program continues. Banders in Idaho are at a loss to explain why record numbers of hummingbirds were captured last summer. Dr Pollock believes that reasons may include a good breeding year to better migrating conditions, but researchers can only speculate. ‘Our knowledge has increased and made us realise how little we know and how much there still is to learn about hummingbirds,’ Mr Peterjohn said.","Ornithologists in the US say hummingbirds can live longer than 10 years .

"South African police are investigating President Jacob Zuma over a £14.5million taxpayer-funded refurbishment project at his rural homestead, according to parliamentary papers. In a written police response to lawmakers published Monday, police confirmed that an investigation into spending at Zuma's Nkandla home 'has been initiated.' Zuma, who was reelected in May, has insisted that he had no knowledge of the work on his home, including the construction of a swimming pool, private clinic and amphitheatre. File photo of South Africa President Jacob Zuma's private Nkandla estate in his home state of KwaZulu-Natal . South African President Jacob Zuma has insisted that he had no knowledge of the work on his home, including the construction of a swimming pool, private clinic and amphitheatre . His government has insisted all the refurbishments were security related. The issue has become a lightning rod for criticism of Zuma's administration, which is seen by many South Africans as tolerant of corruption and incompetence. The scandal, known as ‘Nkandla’ after the nearest town to the sprawling property, has sparked massive resentment at the lifestyle enjoyed by the President and his extended family while millions of South Africans continue to live in poverty, despite the end of apartheid 20 years ago. Opposition leader, Mmusi Maimane, of the Democratic Alliance said 'now the police must do their jobs.' Maimane and other opposition politicians had called for Zuma to be the subject of a criminal investigation over the issue, and have demanded he resign. Former South African President Nelson Mandela, centre, is helped as he walks up the stairs by current ANC president and presidential candidate Jacob Zuma, left and Mandela's former wife Winnie, in 2009 . A damning report by the country’s top anti-corruption official in March described improvements at the residence used by Mr Zuma, his four wives and more than 20 children, as an 'unconscionable and excessive misappropriation of public funds'. The public ombudsman Thuli Madonsela ruled that Zuma had 'benefited unduly' from the construction, ordering him to payback some of the money spent on the home. The report, entitled ‘Secure in Comfort’, established that while a personal clinic and house for police officers might reasonably form part of a security plan. However, the amphitheatre, visitors’ centre and extensive new facilities for the Zuma family’s chickens and cattle could not. An earlier internal government probe into the renovations had found that the works were essential for the president’s security. In plans, the swimming pool was described as 'a fire pool' required in the event of a blaze at the largely-thatched residence. Zuma has faced both political and public wrath of the excessive spending, in a country battling rampant unemployment and inequality. Mr Zuma is also no stranger to controversy, having faced rape and corruption charges before becoming president.","Officers say probe into spending on Jacob Zuma's lavish home has begun .

"Israel has warned world leaders not to give-in to Iranian demands over its nuclear program simply so it can meet a deadline to conclude a deal with Tehran. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said  that Israel won't support any agreement that allows Iran to be a threshold nuclear state. As angry Arab-Israeli protesters yesterday took to the streets in protest of the police shooting of a young Arab-Israeli, Netanyahu spoke out saying the international community faces a 'clear choice'. Angry protesters yesterday took to the streets across Israel in protest over the police shooting of an Arab-Israeli youth while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with world leaders to implore them not to cave in to Iranian demands over its nuclear program . Netanyahu said world leaders needed to 'stand firm' and insist Iran dismantle its capacity to produce weapons . Israel security forces walk towards Arab-Israeli youths during clashes in the town of Kfar Kana yesterday . According to the Jerusalem Post, he said: 'It can cave to Iranian demands in an agreement that would be dangerous for Israel and the world. 'Or it can stand firm and insist that Iran dismantle its capacity to produce nuclear weapons.' Netanyahu spoke as Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met with US Secretary of State John Kerry, European Union envoy Catherine Ashton and Oman's Foreign Minister Yusuf Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah in Oman to advance efforts to end a standoff over Tehran's nuclear program. According to reports the talks, hoped to end Iran's sensitive uranium enrichment work in exchange for a gradual lifting of sanctions, are happening just two weeks before a self-imposed November 24 deadline for striking a deal. It is suspected that Iran has secretly sought to develop the means to build nuclear weapons. Israel has been forthright in expressing its concerns, accusing Iran of lying and deceiving the world in its pursuit for nuclear weapons. Arab-Israeli youths set fires in clashes with Israel security forces in the town of Kfar Kana, following the shooting of Kfar Kana near the northern city of Nazareth on Saturday . Iran is ruled by a regime that calls for Israel's destruction and denies human rights to its citizens. Netanyahu said the international community must 'make sure such a regime' is not armed. But the Islamic Republic claims that its program is entirely for peaceful purposes. Kerry, who arrived in Oman yesterday, has said that the U.S. and its partners were not considering extending the deadline. However, he also said that negotiations could go beyond the deadline if major issues were agreed and there were only technical details to wrap up. Yesterday, shops, schools and businesses were shuttered in Arab towns and villages where a general strike was observed over Saturday's killing of Kfar Kana, 22, near the northern city of Nazareth. Mounted police dispersed masked protesters who hurled stones and fireworks, blocked streets with burning tyres and waved Palestinian flags. Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said that 22 people were arrested, among them minors. Kheir Hamdan was shot after he attacked a police vehicle with a knife as officers tried to arrest a relative. An Arab Israeli protester waves a Palestinian flag during a rally in the northern Israeli town of Umm al-Faham . Police say the officers fired  warning shots until they felt their lives were threatened, when they aimed directly at him. Relatives say Hamdan was killed 'in cold blood', with CCTV images apparently contradicting the official version. In the video he is seen banging on a police van window with a knife before starting to run off. Then a uniformed officer gets out of the vehicle's back door and fires his handgun at Hamdan, who falls to the ground. Officers then drag his body into the vehicle by one arm. Israel's attorney general yesterday convened an emergency meeting on the incident, hearing initial reports from the police internal affairs division, a justice ministry statement said, adding that the inquiry would continue. The incident came as Israel struggled to cope with a wave of unrest which has gripped annexed east Jerusalem for more than four months, with police facing off against youths almost nightly. Arab students protested the Kana killing yesterday in Jerusalem, the northern port city of Haifa and in Beersheva in southern Israel's Negev desert. In the northern Arab town of Umm al-Fahm, about 250 people rallied, among them firebrand Islamic cleric Raed Salah. Stones were hurled at a bus on the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway alongside the Arab village of Abu Ghosh, police said. Masked Arab-Israeli youths shoot firecrackers during clashes with Israel security forces . In strife-torn east Jerusalem, clashes raged in Shuafat refugee camp for a fifth straight day as masked youths held running battles with Israeli border police. Elsewhere in east Jerusalem, masked Palestinians hurled petrol bombs at police in A-Tur and threw stones in Issawiya, with police responding with 'riot dispersal means' in both cases, police statements said. No injuries were reported. Adalah, an NGO which fights for the rights of Israel's Arab minority, called the shooting 'an execution,' dismissing the police's version about warning shots. But Netanyahu vowed that anyone breaking the law would be 'punished severely'. He said: 'We will not tolerate disturbances and riots,' he told the weekly cabinet meeting. Netanyah said he had instructed Internal Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch to look at 'revoking the citizenship' of anyone calling for Israel's destruction, in a threat clearly aimed at the Arab minority of around 1.4 million -- some 20 per cent of the population.

"It seems a roaring fire wasn't the only thing keeping Bronze and Iron Age Scandinavians warm through cold winter nights. From northwest Denmark, from 1500 to 1300 BC, to the Swedish island of Gotland as late as the first century AD, Nordic people were drinking an alcoholic ‘grog’. Chemical traces of the ingredients of the drink were found buried in tombs alongside warriors and priestesses, . Scroll down for video... Ancient Scandinavians drunk an alcoholic mixture of barley, honey, cranberries, herbs and grape wine imported from Greece and Rome. Pictured here is an ancient Roman drinking-set, comprised of a bucket  a ladle, and several drinking cups. They were uncovered under the floor of a settlement at Havor in Sweden . Honey . Bog cranberry . Lingonberry . Bog myrtle . Yarrow . Juniper . Birch tree resin . Wheat . Grapes . Barley . Rye . By analysing chemicals found in ancient jars, scientists revealed that the drink was a hybrid of local ingredients. These included honey, bog cranberry, lingonberry, bog myrtle, yarrow, juniper, birch tree resin, and cereals including wheat, grapes barley and rye. The research proves the existence of an early, widespread, and long-lived Nordic grog tradition - one with distinctive flavours and probable medicinal purposes. It also provides the first chemically proven evidence of importing grapes from southern or central Europe as early as 1100 BC, demonstrating both the social and cultural prestige attached to wine. Samples of the drink were found buried in tombs alongside warriors and priestesses. Pictured here is a uoung woman, believed to be a priestess, buried in an oak trunk coffin under a mound at Egtved in Jutland, Denmark . With Dr McGovern's help, Delaware-based . Dogfish Head Craft Brewery recreated the Nordic grog in October 2013, . using wheat, berries, honey and herbs. According to Dr McGovern, the grog tastes sour, like a Belgian lambic. There are also other options available to those who want a taste of Bronze Age Europe. The Swedish brewery Nynäshamns Ångbryggeri, for instance, created different version of grog called Arketyp. ‘About the closest thing to the grog today is produced on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea,’ Dr McGovern noted. ‘You can taste Gotlandsdryka in . farmhouses. It’s made from barley, honey, juniper, and other herbs like . those in the ancient version.' ‘Far from being the barbarians so vividly described by ancient Greeks and Romans, the early Scandinavians, northern inhabitants of so-called Proxima Thule, emerge with this new evidence as a people with an innovative flair for using available natural products’, said Dr Patrick McGovern, lead author of the paper. ‘They were not averse to adopting the accoutrements of southern or central Europeans, drinking their preferred beverages out of imported and often ostentatiously grand vessels,# he added. ‘They were also not averse to importing and drinking the southern beverage of preference, grape wine, though sometimes mixed with local ingredients.” To reach their conclusions the researchers, based at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, obtained ancient residue samples from four sites in a 150-mile radius of southern Sweden and encompassing Denmark. The oldest, dated 1500 – 1300 BC, was from Nandrup in northwestern Denmark, where a warrior prince had been buried in an oak coffin with a massively hafted bronze sword, battle-axe, and pottery jar whose interior was covered with a dark residue that was sampled. A second Danish sample, dated to a later phase of the Nordic Bronze Age from about 1100 – 500 BC, came from a pit hoard at Kostræde, southwest of Copenhagen. A brownish residue filling a perforation of a bronze strainer, the earliest strainer yet recovered in the region, was sampled. VIDEO: Dogfish Brewery recounst re-creation of Scandinavian ancient ale . A third Danish sample was a dark residue on the interior base of a large bronze bucket from inside a wooden coffin of a 30-year-old woman, dating to the Early Roman Iron Age, about 200 BC, at Juellinge on the island of Lolland, southwest of Kostræde. The bucket was part of a standard, imported Roman wine-set, and the woman held the strainer-cup in her right hand. A reddish-brown residue filling the holes and interior of a strainer-cup, again part of imported Roman wine-set, provided the fourth sample. Dating to the first century AD, the strainer-cup was excavated from a hoard, which also included a large gold torque or neck ring and a pair of bronze bells, at Havor on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. According to Dr McGovern, the . importation of southern wine grew rapidly in the Bronze and Iron Ages, . and eventually eclipsed the grog tradition - but never completely.

"The BBC sends out almost 100,000 letters every working day threatening viewers with £1,000 fines unless they pay the TV licence fee. MPs accused the corporation of heavy-handed bullying after it emerged it posted 47million letters demanding payment in the past two years. The mass mail-outs cost the BBC around £5million a year, the equivalent of 34,000 licence fees, even though only around 5 per cent of homes avoid the £145.50 charge. Scroll down for video .

TV Licensing spends more than £100million a year collecting payments, . almost 3p for every pound it manages to collect. Tory MP Rob Wilson said the figures showed the BBC has ‘got its priorities all wrong’. He added: ‘While . everyone should pay their bills, there is a strong element here of . chasing people for a television poll tax which can be viewed as . counter-productive. 'The . BBC needs to map out a future away from total reliance on a  licence . fee to one where it focuses on producing quality programmes that the . public wants.’ The first licence fee was issued in November 1922 for radio users, and cost a princely 10 shillings (50p). The first combined Radio/TV licence - for £2 - was issued in June 1946. As television became popular, radio-only licences were abolished in February 1971. The first supplementary licence fee for colour TV was introduced in January 1968. The original iPlayer service was launched as a five-month trial in October 2005, with 5,000 broadband users testing it. It was then gradually rolled out and made available to more people across the UK until in 2011 an international version was launched. A television licence is not needed to watch iPlayer content after it has been broadcast. A . freedom of information request revealed that the BBC sent 25.1million . threatening letters to homes without a TV licence last year, up from . 21.5million the year before. It means 99,200 letters were sent every working day last year. Many . homes received multiple letters, warning them of the large fines and . possible prison sentences that can be imposed for non-payment. Last . year 153,369 people were cautioned or convicted for not paying their TV . licence, accounting for one in nine of all magistrates’ court cases. Many . were landed with penalties of up to £1,000 and a criminal record. Between 50 and 70 viewers are sent to jail each year after they fail to . pay the court fines. The . corporation’s army of licence fee collectors are paid a bonus every . time they bring a TV viewer to court, further driving up the number of . prosecutions. Following . a backbench campaign earlier this year led by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, . the Government has promised to review the licence fee arrangements and . consider decriminalising non-payment. Last night Mr Bridgen said the number of letters being sent out was ‘symptomatic of the BBC’s heavy-handed approach’. He added: ‘It shows it is completely out of touch with the public. The . BBC treats the licence fee as a poll tax that everyone has to pay, and . spends millions of pounds of our money harassing people.’ Despite the fact that only five per cent of the 26.4 million households in Britain evade the payment, 46 million letters were still sent out by TV Licensing in the past two years . John .

"A 42-year-old middle school teacher is facing charges for giving one of her students a birthday lap dance during class. Felicia A. Smith allegedly performed a 'full-contact' lap dance for the boy as he sat in a chair in the front of the classroom at Stovall Middle School in February. Smith ended the dance by hugging the boy and saying, 'I love you baby, happy birthday,' according to court documents. Inappropriate: Felicia Smith allegedly gave one of her students a lap dance in front of the entire class of teens . Court records show that Smith admitted to police that she gave the student a lap dance on his birthday after the class 'convinced her to do it.' KHOU reports that the student told police that at the beginning of his third-period class, Smith placed a chair in front of the room and music began playing. The class began yelling for the boy to sit down, and when he did, Smith began dancing for the boy. He said he became aroused as Smith fondled him and rubbed her hands and buttocks on his body and allowed him to slap her buttocks. Middle school teacher: Smith has been removed from the campus and a judge has set her bail at $30,000 . Smith told police she remembered 'circling the student while he was sitting in the chair and losing her balance a few times which made the students laugh,' reports KHOU. The dance lasted almost four minutes and was reportedly captured on video. Smith was charged with having an improper relationship with a student on Thursday. 'The teacher was removed from the campus during the investigation and has not returned. The district takes this allegation seriously and is fully cooperating with prosecutors. The safety and security of our students will continue to be a top priority in Aldine ISD,' the Aldine Independent School District said in a statement. Bail has been set at $30,000.","Felicia Smith, 42, allegedly gave a 15-year-old student a lap dance for his birthday during class .

"Shaun Wadey was left needing hospital treatment for whiplash after he was thrown from his seat on a ferry which crashed into a harbour wall . An investigation has been launched into how a cross-channel ferry carrying 320 passengers crashed into a harbour wall, hospitalising four people and leaving others injured. Passengers told of scenes of 'carnage' on board the Dover Seaways ship after it slammed into the dockside during an 8am crossing to Dunkirk yesterday. Photos taken inside the vessel show passengers lying on the floor amid broken chairs and smashed glass after the accident at the Kent port. Shaun Wadey, 25, was left needing hospital treatment for severe whiplash after he was thrown from his seat and into a wall. The sales manager, from Worthing, West Sussex, was supposed to be heading to the French port of Calais with his sister Nikki Brett, 29, and her husband Paul, but they accidentally boarded the wrong ship. He told MailOnline: 'It was going straight for the harbour wall and we were thinking, he's going to start turning now, he's going to turn, oh c**p, he's not. 'I was sitting at an angle. I tried grabbing hold of the table but I flew two metres and landed on a railing next to a window. 'I then got showered in plates and glasses. I don't remember blacking out but my sister says she thought I was unconscious. 'It was carnage on board, with people lying down on the floor, with smashed plates and drinks glasses around them. 'We drove ourselves to a hospital because there was lots of people needing treatment. There was one pregnant woman with two kids who looked like she was hurt.' Mr Wadey was given a CT scan and doctors checked him for internal bleeding but he was given the all clear. He suffered whiplash, which he says is very painful. Four adults were taken to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, Kent, as a precautionary measure, although none were believed to have suffered life-threatening or serious injuries. A disabled woman is believed to be among the injured after she was reportedly knocked unconscious in the smash. Photos taken on  the ship show bottles of spirits thrown over the floor of the on-board shop . Witnesses say they thought the ship was going to turn, but it kept going and crashed into the harbour wall . Joan Tiernan, 51, from Godstone, Surrey was heading away for a short break to the Belgian city of Bruges with her husband Paschal, 53. Mrs Tiernan said: 'We were at the back of the ferry at the time. We had only just left the dock. It was all fine but we could see the sea was rough outside the harbour. 'My husband thinks there was a change in engine noise but we weren't going very fast. Then after a few seconds there was a huge crash. It was clear we had hit something very large. 'People were thrown around. There were two disabled ladies sitting next to us. Both of them had multiple sclerosis. 'One of the ladies had gone to the loo with a walking frame. She was knocked unconscious after banging her head. We helped her up and stayed with her until the staff came to help her. 'In the restaurant people had been thrown to the floor. It looked like there had been a food fight in there. It was everywhere. The duty free shop looked like it had been ram raided. 'It was sort of shocking at the time but there was no panic. Everyone was quite calm but a lot of people were bemused because there was no announcements and no information given. Staff were just going round telling everyone it was ok.' Passengers said the shop looked like it has been 'ram-raided', with bottles of spirits and gifts everywhere . Photos from the scene show the damage done to the ship, which was brought back into dock after the incident . Sea conditions in the English Channel were slight to moderate and visibility was good just before the ferry set off on its journey, the Port of Dover said. The Port, which is carrying out its own investigation, said it was likely that the Marine Accident Investigation Branch would also be looking into the incident which was 'normal procedure'. A spokesman said the Port and Dover Seaways had immediately put emergency plans into practice to ensure the safety of those on board. He said: 'Our first priority is always to ensure safety of all those who use the port. Thankfully incidents whilst relatively rare are always professionally and rapidly dealt with.' He added: 'The vessel, Dover Seaways, is safely berthed in the Eastern Docks. We praise all concerned for their swift response. 'Naturally, the incident will be subject to our own internal investigation and that of the appropriate statutory authorities.' Photos later tweeted by the Kent 999s Twitter account show the damage done to the ship's bow by the smash. DFDS said passengers who wished to continue their journey had been accommodated on other DFDS Seaways ferries. A spokeswoman said the ferry was being assessed for repairs but could not say how bad the damage was or when the ship was expected to sail again. A Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) spokeswoman said it had been informed of the incident but that it was being dealt with by Dover Port. She said the MCA was in consultation with a surveyor who would be assessing the damage to the ferry today. Tugboats moved the stricken vessel back into place after the alarm was raised with the port's authorities .

"She had not seen her husband for nine years after he vanished without an explanation in 2005. So, when Karen Marx finally tracked down her spouse, Adam Marx, via Facebook, she was thrilled. However, the 48-year-old's joy quickly turned to shock when she realized her long-lost husband was living in the same state as her and was happily married - to someone else. Disgruntled: Karen Marx (pictured), 48, spent nine years searching for her husband, Adam Marx, after he vanished without an explanation in 2005. But when she finally found him, she discovered he had wed again . New wife: Marx, pictured with his new wife, Marcie, in a Facebook photo, was investigated by police last month. He was later charged with bigamy and fraud , as well as making a false statement on his marriage license . 'I just thought, 'How could he get married again?' Ms Marx, from New London, Wisconsin, told Post-Crescent Media. 'Am I dead? What did he do with my identity?' Following her discovery, the stunned wife contacted the police, who arrested Marx and charged him with bigamy, fraud and making a false statement on his marriage license. Marx, who appeared in court several weeks ago, faces up to six years in prison if convicted of fraud and three-and-a-half years if found guilty of bigamy. Ms Marx, a mother-of-three, met her long-haired husband at Outagamie County Fair in the late 1990s. At the time, he had two children of his own and was reportedly still married to his first wife. But despite his marital status, Marx agreed to divorce his former partner for Ms Marx and after doing so in 2001, married his second wife a year later on Valentine's Day. Following a courthouse wedding, the pair enjoyed a formal dinner, before taking a honeymoon in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Hiding a secret: Ms Marx, from New London, Wisconsin, met her long-haired husband (pictured with Marcie) at Outagamie County Fair in the late 1990s.

Biker: Despite his marital status, Marx agreed to divorce his former partner for Ms Marx and after doing so in 2001, married his second wife a year later on Valentine's Day. Above, Marx in another Facebook photo . Marx then quit his job and moved in with his wife, who worked as a machine operator and used her income to support their combined families. But just a year later, he reportedly vanished from the family home, leaving behind a note saying he could not handle his spouse's children. 'The first time he left me, it was like somebody reached into my chest and ripped my heart out of me,' Ms Marx said. 'He basically told me it was all my fault and he couldn't handle my kids.' Several months later, Marx returned - just in time for his wife's Christmas bonus. Despite her concerns, Ms Marx took him back and even spent $401,000 on a new home for them and their children in Clinton, Montana. Over the next year, Marx started working for a timber-framing company and helped his wife's teenage son get into the business. But he quickly began racking up debt with payday loans, according to Ms Marx, who also started to suspect her husband was cheating on her. Following a heated argument, Marx suddenly packed his bags, loaded up his truck and left, without leaving a note or giving his wife a clear explanation for his departure. Home: In 2012 - seven years after Marx left the family home during a heated argument - Ms Marx returned to New London (file picture) in Wisconsin to care for her father, before tracking down her missing husband . For the following nine years, Ms Marx desperately searched for her husband while battling poor health and serious financial issues. In 2012, she returned to New London to care for her father, before tracking down her husband's mother on Facebook and contacting her. It was during her conversation with Marx's mother last month that she found out about her husband's new life - and his new wife, Marcie. During the police investigation, Marx, who lives with Marcie Marx in Vernon County, allegedly told officers that he thought Ms Marx had taken care of their divorce while she was in Montana. Found: It was during a conversation with Marx's mother last month that Ms Marx found out about her husband's new life - and his new wife, Marcie (seen with Marx). She described her discovery as 'shocking' But Ms Marx told the newspaper: 'They said he told people it was his first marriage, and the (clerk) never checked vital statistics. I think people need to start doing their job.' She added that she now intends to file for divorce - and will not date anyone until it is finalized. 'I consider myself married. I thought when you married someone, you married him for life, through sickness and health,' she said.","Karen Marx's husband, Adam Marx, vanished from family home in 2005 .

"A burger joint owner has been bombarded with death threats after he enraged the vegan community by describing them as ‘single-minded and Nazi-like’ in a Facebook comment. Mark Clews, who has run the Tuk Tuk restaurant in the Hunter Valley, NSW, for 15 months, posted his views on vegans after he received his first anti-animal product customer on Sunday morning, News.com.au reported. He wrote on the company’s Facebook page: ‘Well, we had our first ever vegan in yesterday, wearing a tie dyed t-shirt, I’m serious, didn’t matter that it was made in a Chinese sweat shop.’ The Tuk Tuk offers vegetarian burgers but owner Mark Clews warned they are cooked on the same grill as the more popular meat burgers . After receiving his first vegan customer in the restaurant's 15 months since opening, Mr Clews posted on the company's Facebook page . In the first of a string of comments, he continued: ‘She was very disappointed that we didn’t have more vegan choices in a hamburger shop? But settled on the falafel burger without yoghurt and without butter.’ Mr Clews told Daily Mail Australia that he went over to her table to warn her that the pattie would be cooked on the same grill as the beef, pork and lamb patties because they don’t have time to clean the top inbetween every order and she told him that it was fine. ‘I said “I’m very sorry, it may contain traces of slaughtered animals” and she happily ate it anyway,’ he said. He wrote on Facebook: ‘Guess she wasn’t that vegan after all, it’s a funny world.’ Mr Clews explained that he then ‘put a very flippant, Australian, larrikin comment on our Facebook paged and it didn’t go well.’ A woman posted on the Tuk Tuk page: ‘Do not mess with the Vegans, EVER!!!!’ Mr Clews said he won't apologise for not being 'politically correct' One commentator wrote 'do not mess with the Vegans. Ever!!!' Mr Clews replied saying they are 'Nazi like in their conviction' Angry commentators bombarded Mr Clews Facebook page but he did not back down . To which he replied: ‘But they are so easy to mess with. They lack physical strength because of zero red meat in their diet! They are single-minded and Nazi-like in there conviction! ‘Their ""veganism"" was inspired by some tragic childhood event, or a divorce, or a car accident or some crap. ‘And the worst thing, from a chef’s point of view is they cannot cook a vegetable to save their life, they are sh*t cooks, end of story, over and out.’ He said the vegan moment has now adopted him as the latest business to ‘attack with their vitriol, with their threats of violence’. He explained that angry vegans had found his personal phone number online and rang him at 11pm on Sunday night. Mr Clews was told that his family would be 'slaughtered' in one alarming phone call . Despite the controversy, Mr Clews said on Monday he had the best day's trade since the restaurant opened . ‘They said “I’m going to come and slaughter you like you slaughter animals”,’ he revealed. ‘I’m worried for the safety of my family and workmates… there are a lot of comments on Facebook saying there is going to be a delegation on Tuesday who are going to “flog the f*** out of me”.’ Mr Clews said he won’t apologise for not being ‘politically correct’ but if the vegan woman walked into the shop again he would apologise if he had caused her any offence. He described how he loves animals, is anti-horse racing and only uses free-range eggs at the restaurant and locally and ethically sourced meat. ‘The idiotic thing is I let every possum and kangaroo live on my land. I feed the chooks our scraps from the restaurant, I have two pet pigs that are like my babies, I’ve got my dog I spent $600 at the vet on recently. 'I have a pet parrot that lives inside my home, the whole home is her aviary, I have a pet snake with a permit for, I have a horse who I refuse to ride as I think its animal cruelty…. I am someone who loves and cares for animals,’ he reasoned.

"Travellers feared their lives were in danger when a passenger plane was jolted by a lightning strike as it flew through a storm near the US east coast. Shaken passengers said a loud thud and bright flash of light were followed by a burning odour aboard their United Airlines flight when the frightening incident occurred Monday night. After the lightning strike, the captain decided to abort the journey and make an emergency landing in Columbia, South Carolina, as a precaution. Electrifying: A United Airlines plane was struck by lightning as it travelled from Chicago to Charleston . Flight 4613 was carrying nearly 50 passengers and crew as it travelled from Chicago to Charleston, South Carolina. Passenger Brian Cooper told WCSC: 'It was definitely scary. We all knew that it was lightning. 'There was a bright flash of lightning that jolted the plane. I think most of us felt it, then definitely smelled some burning.' Despite the odour, passengers said they didn't see flames or smoke aboard the Embraer ERJ-145XR. After the plane diverted to Columbia Metropolitan Airport, it was inspected by technicians who found that the plane's air conditioning unit had been damaged. People on board the plane, similar to the one pictured, said a flash of light was followed by a burning odour . Because the airline decided to ground the plane for repairs, passengers were forced to complete the rest of their journey to Charleston with a coach ride that lasted more than two hours. John Cane, a former Marine Corps harrier pilot who now runs his own aviation investigation firm, said lightning strikes are rare and passengers should not feel unsafe, even though they are capable of disrupting a plane's instruments. He told WCBD: 'In all likelihood it's not going to knock the aeroplane out of the sky.' Perfect timing: A cargo plane was struck by lightning near Leipzig, Germany in August . Photographer Birk Mobius captured one of those rare moments in August when a cargo plane was struck by lightning near Leipzig, Germany. Mr Mobius' once-in-a-lifetime photo, taken from the ground at a small airfield, shows a streak of lightning hitting one end of the plane and shooting out of the other end. The lightning bolt continues to the ground with a rainbow in the background.

"It is one of the most iconic bridges in London and a symbol of the capital recognised throughout the world. But Tower Bridge could have been replaced by a tunnel if design proposals submitted by a Victorian engineer had been chosen instead. The extraordinary picture - which was the design of John Standfield - shows the landmark river crossing replaced by a tunnel with gothic towers on either side. Engineer John Standfield's proposals in 1876 could have seen a tunnel underneath the River Thames instead of the iconic Tower Bridge . It dates from when the City Corporation was inviting proposals for a river crossing in 1876. The oil painting of the cross-section shows the tunnel of remarkably low depth with hydraulic platforms at either end to lower horses and carts under the water. Despite being almost inconceivable given Tower Bridge's now iconic status, the proposals by the member of the Institute of Civil Engineers were one of 50 serious submissions made to the City Corporation. The painting is now to be auctioned by Christie’s where it is expected to fetch up to £4,000. Tower Bridge, pictured during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, might never have been if a Victorian engineer had got his way . A modern makeover: The bridge was built to cope with the demand of pedestrians wanting to cross the river, and has now become a striking feature of the London skyline . Two piers were sunk into the river . bed to support the construction and over 11,000 tons of steel provided . the framework for the Towers and Walkways. When it was built, Tower Bridge was . the largest and most sophisticated bascule bridge ever completed . ('bascule' comes from the French word for 'see-saw'). These bascules were operated by hydraulics, using steam to power the enormous pumping engines. The energy created was stored in six . massive accumulators, as soon as power was required to lift the Bridge, . it was always readily available. The accumulators fed the driving engines, which drove the bascules up and down. Tom Rooth, from Christie's, said: 'There were lots of schemes that were submitted to the City Corporation. 'And this was an artist’s impression of what John Standfield planned. 'It shows the ambition of the Victorians who believed that anything was impossible.' Standfield's proposals were possibly inspired by the creation of the first tunnel to be built beneath the Thames between 1825 and 1843. The Thames Tunnel, connecting Rotherhithe and Wapping, now forms part of the London Overground railway network. London Bridge was originally the only crossing for the Thames, but as the size of the city bloomed more bridges were constructed. These had to be built to the west of London Bridge, since the area east of the bridge had become a busy port. But in the 19th century the east of London became so densely populated that pedestrians and vehicles were being delayed by hours, so a new bridge was planned in 1876. It took 8 years, 5 major contractors and 432 construction workers to build Tower Bridge, which is built in Cornish granite and Portland stone.","Designs by Victorian engineer John Standfield were a serious submission and might have meant the iconic Tower Bridge was never built .

"It has been described as one of the most important archaeological discoveries of the last 100 years. And now the hoard of Bronze Age treasure unearthed in a remote area of Dartmoor two years ago has come under the spotlight again as experts think it could have belonged to a prehistoric princess. Intriguing finds including earrings, beads, a studded bracelet and a near perfectly preserved basket and animal pelt will be the subject of a one-off documentary, before going on show to the public later this year. The basket (pictured) is around 4,000 years old and held a collection of ancient beads, wooden earrings and a flink flake, shedding light on a Bronze Age society capable of amazing craftsmanship and international trade . The objects, which were pulled from an ancient cremation burial chamber in south Devon, have fascinated scientists since they were discovered in 2011 and have allowed them one of the best glimpses into life in Bronze Age Southern England that they have ever had. In a BBC 2 documentary scheduled to air in early March called 'Mystery on the Moor,' viewers will be able to witness the moment an intricately coiled bag is opened for the first time in 4,000 years. The basket held a collection of precious beads, wooden earrings and a flint flake, shedding light on an advanced society capable of amazing craftsmanship and international trade. Intriguing finds including prehistoric wooden earrings (pictured right), beads (also pictured), a studded bracelet and a near perfectly animal pelt have just gone on show at a new exhibition . The pelt was found in 2011 in a peat bog on White Horse Hill wrapped around artefacts found in the grave, including a woven basket containing precious amber beads and earrings, as well as the cremated remains of a Bronze Age princes (actor pictured) It is fashioned from two circular disks measuring 4.5 inches (12cm) in diameter to form a flat base and lid, which is joined by a tube made using a coiled basketry technique with cow hair stitching around the edge and was preserved in peat. The wooden earrings inside, which measure up to an inch (2.5cm) in diameter, have side grooves and are made from spindle wood – a hard, fine grained tree that grows in Dartmoor which is traditionally used to make knitting needles. Archaeologists think the yo-yo-shaped studs were worn in the ears or set into leather belts or other clothing. The objects were pulled from a prehistoric cremation burial chamber (pictured) in Devon and have allowed scientists to get one of the best glimpses into life in Bronze Age Southern England . A carefully-prepared animal pelt (pictured) was folded around the cremated remains of the individual as well as what is thought to be a skilfully-made decorative sash or belt, composed of textile and leather with a fringe of outward pointing leather triangles made from thin calf skin . ‘The studs are unique in British prehistory; they also represent the earliest evidence for wood turning in the UK,’ experts at the Dartmoor National Park Authority said. Archaeologists are using the objects to build up a picture of the person who was buried at the site on Whitehorse Hill and it is thought they were of considerable importance in the local community. They speculate that the items, which also include precious jewellery, belonged to a women between the age of 14 and 25-years-old, who was probably a princess. An expert at Dartmoor National Park Authority told MailOnline that archaeologists came to this conclusion as other lesser, comparable items have been founded in prehistoric cairns. The wooden earrings (pictured) measure up to two-and-a-half centimetres in diameter and and are made from spindle wood - a hard, fine grained tree that grows in Dartmoor which is traditionally used to make knitting needles . Here, TV presenter Mike Dilger helps to recreate the earrings in his forthcoming programme. He will examine Dartmoor's place as an area of prehistoric importance and shed more light on the person to whom the preserved possessions once belonged . The princess was of incredibly high social standing, as evidenced by the high position of her final resting place 600 metres above sea level on the northern moors, which would have been visible to nearby settlements and the valuable items that were buried with her. Archaeologists first stumbled across the chamber a decade ago when a stone fell out of the peat hag which had been concealing it – far from other known prehistoric sites. 'The find fills in the blanks of the local map in terms of Bronze Age settlements, as before there was little evidence of inhabitation, so there must be a settlement nearby,' one local expert told MailOnline. 'There's much more to discover in the area,' he said. A delicate woven bracelet with tin studs (pictured) was also unearthed. A total of 35 tin studs were held in place by a band of woven cow hair (although 32 remain). While the metal has oxidized, it would have been shiny in appearance . The ancient burial chamber (pictured) was deliberately positioned high upon a hill to show the princess' high status, experts said. They expect to find a settlement nearby . Bronze Age Britons were skilled at making tin and might have traded it with other far flung communities. They used to create elaborate jewellery, such as the delicate bracelet that was found. Other materials found at the site - including amber beads - show that people traded internationally. A stone flint also discovered, showed that while people used bronze tools, there were also still using earlier tools, which again, would probably have been traded. High status individuals were revered and were buried in elaborate burial chambers with precious possessions. It is not known how many people the princess would have ruled over but Dartmoor was well inhabited 4,000 years ago. The remains of 5,000 hut circles - Bronze Age houses have been discovered so far that had conical thatched roofs. Archaeologists have previously found small clusters of these houses in fenced enclosures that would have protected people from animals. People at the time had advanced cultural and religious beliefs. High status people also took care with their appearance and wore carefully crafted clothes and jewellery from fur pelts to tin beaded bracelets. A carefully-prepared animal pelt was . folded around the cremated remains of the individual as well as what is . thought to be a skilfully-made decorative sash or belt, composed of . textile and leather with a fringe of outward pointing leather triangles . made from thin calf skin, experts said. But the discovery of beads made of tin got archaeologists particularly excited because they are the earliest evidence of tin production found in the South West. Over 200 beads were plucked from and around the basket and some are made from amber. The precious material from the Baltic was associated with supernatural powers and used as an amulet, which therefore suggests a very high status burial as well as demonstrating that Bronze Age Britons traded with people from the continent. A delicate woven bracelet with tin studs was also unearthed. A total of 35 tin studs are held in place by a band of woven cow hair. While the metal has oxidized, it would have been shiny in appearance. ‘The use of tin for decorative objects . is exceptionally rare within prehistoric burial contexts in Britain and . despite tin being a locally available resource on Dartmoor, this is the . first time it has been found within a prehistoric archaeological . context,’ local experts said. In . the forthcoming programme, TV presenter Mike Dilger will examine . Dartmoor’s place as an area of prehistoric importance, shed more light . on the person to whom the preserved possessions once belonged and will . also try and re-create the delicate tin bracelet and ear studs with the . help of craftspeople. The artefacts from Whitehorse Hill will go on display at Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery in September. Over 200 beads were plucked from and around the basket and some are made from amber, demonstrating international trade as the precious material comes from the Baltic. The grey beads are made from shale and the centre bead from tin - another precious material showing the wearer was of high social status . Here, a model wears modern replicas of what the prehistoric jewellery is thought to have looked like.

"The Today show has denied rumors that Natalie Morales is looking for new roles after falling out with fellow co-host Tamron Hall. The morning show's co-host was reportedly considering a move because of the 'tense atmosphere' behind the scenes, Page Six reported. NBC News President Deborah Turness has not spoken to Morales 'in months' and is looking to promoting Hall to a bigger role over her, according to the newspaper. Hall and Morales fell out last month, according to a source. Scroll down for video . 'Falling out': NBC sources have claimed that Natalie Morales, left, and Tamron Hall, right, have fallen out and that Morales is looking for roles elsewhere due to the backstage tension - but NBC has denied the reports . 'Passed over': Morales has been at the Today show since 2006 but Savannah Guthrie, in pink, joined the show in 2012 and took the top anchor spot. They are pictured with Matt Lauer and Al Roker . 'There's a lot of tension,' a source reportedly told the paper. 'It's the talk of NBC staff.' The source added that Morales met with the show's executive producer Don Nash but that she didn't get the reassurance she had been hoping for. Morales joined the Today team in 2006 as a national correspondent but she has missed out on being the top anchor, including when Ann Curry left in 2012. Following Curry's emotional exit after just a year in the job, she was replaced by Savannah Guthrie. Morales and NBC News President Deborah Turness have not spoken in months, according to sources . But other sources told the paper that Natalie still has two more years on her contract so will not be leaving any time soon. 'This is total nonsense,' Don Nash said of the reports. 'As the Today show continues to gain momentum, it sounds like someone is trying to stir up trouble that doesn't exist. 'Natalie Morales is valued by everyone at the news division from the top down, and her future is with the Today show and NBC News.' Over the summer, it emerged that Matt Lauer - who was implicated in Curry leaving the show after just a year - has agreed to extend his contract. Despite Lauer's popularity taking a plunge after Curry's departure, NBC's own research showed that losing Lauer would be much more damaging, and his bosses let him know he was still wanted. NBC said Lauer's extension was for multiple years, although it would not specify how long. Terms weren't disclosed. He began as a news anchor on 'Today' in 1994 and replaced Bryant Gumbel as co-host three years later. He's worked with Katie Couric, Meredith Vieira, Curry and now Savannah Guthrie as co-hosts.","Today show co-host Natalie Morales joined the team in 2006 but has repeatedly missed out on being top anchor .

"A hospital ordered female staff to go on the pill and told them they would be fired if they fell pregnant after a department was left 'frequently shorthanded' by women taking maternity leave. The memo allegedly posted at the pharmacy department of Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok has sparked outrage with many saying it is a blatant violation of human rights. It said: 'From Oct 30, 2014 to Dec 31, 2015, all female staff must take birth-control pills. Do not get pregnant. Anyone who gets pregnant will be asked to leave.' The hospital memo said: 'All female staff must take birth-control pills. Do not get pregnant. Anyone who gets pregnant will be asked to leave' Under the text, more than 25 staff members signed their names to acknowledge it. A photo of the announcement taken by an employee went viral on social media, and drew strong criticism over the perceived prejudice of the hospital's administration. The order also contradicts Thailand's labour laws, which allows 90 days of maternal leave to employees. Rajavithi Hospital director Dr Udom Chaowarin said he has cancelled the order and claimed it was never endorsed as an official policy. He explained it was an internal message and said the supervisor of the pharmacy department, which is '100 percent' women, was worried too many pregnancies would cause a labour shortage. The order allegedly posted at the pharmacy department of Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok has sparked outrage with many saying it is a blatant violation of human rights . Dr Udom said he had talked to the department chief, who explained it was intended to be 'a plea for cooperation' among the department's staff. 'In any case, the act is unconstitutional,' he said. 'So many maternity leaves had affected the department so it was agreed at a meeting the staff would be asked to cooperate. The method, however, infringed on their rights. 'We have settled this and the memo was scrapped. Everyone can get pregnant and the department will have to find other ways to cope with the staff shortage and report to management,' Dr Udom told the Daily News. Human rights commissioner Visa Benjano said the incident is being investigated. Under the Thai labour law, a worker can take maternity leave before and after the birth for not more than 90 days in total including holidays. The employer must pay her the normal wage for not more than 45 days. If she is a member of the Social Security Fund, she also gets a pay from it for the remaining 45 days of the leave. And if she is a civil servant, as in the case of the Rajavithi Hospital, she may also take a personal leave to look after the baby for another 150 days without pay and promotion eligibility for that year.","Female hospital staff told they would be asked to leave if they fell pregnant .

"An axe-swinging 'rape and pillage' fighter found in a Viking burial pit had filed his teeth to look more ferocious in battle. The pain without anaesthetic would have been excruciating - but it would have proved his status as a great warrior, archaeologists said. The warrior, found in Weymouth, Dorset, had grooves filed into his two front teeth. Status symbols: Remains found in a mass grave in Weymouth, Dorset have revealed that Viking warriors filed 'stripes' into their teeth to show their fighting ability . Scientists also found other bones and decapitated heads in the pit where a new relief road is being built. They think the bodies were young . Viking warriors who were executed without mercy after being captured in a . fierce battle with the Anglo-Saxons. During analysis of the remains, the pair of front teeth was found to have distinct incisions. Lead scientist David Score, of Oxford . Archaeology, said: 'It's difficult to say how painful the process of . filing teeth may have been, but it wouldn't have been a pleasant . experience. 'The incisions have been very carefully made and it is most likely that they were filed by a skilled craftsman. Looking sharp: The warrior had grooves filed into his two front teeth . Scientists think the bodies were young Viking warriors who were executed without mercy after being captured in a fierce battle with Anglo-Saxons . 'The purpose behind filed teeth . remains unclear but, as we know these men were warriors, it may have . been to frighten opponents in battle or to show their status as a great . fighter.' The burial pit contained 51 skulls and 54 bodies. Many of the executed men had been . decapitated and suffered multiple wounds inflicted by a sharp blade, . including one skeleton with six cut marks to the back of the neck, . possibly because his captors had tried over and over again to hack off . his head. Steve Wallis, an archaeologist at . Dorset County Council, said radio carbon dating showed the remains come . from about 970 to 1025. He said those dates fell within the period of Viking raids and atrocities on the Anglo-Saxons in Britain. Isotope analysis of teeth found in a severed jaw suggests they were from the Nordic countries. Mr Wallis said: 'It's great that the . burial pit is surprising us and teaching us more about who these men may . have been and what they may have been like. 'It is very rare that this kind of . deliberate dental modification is found in European remains, although it . is often found in cultures from around the world, so that it was found . in an excavation in Dorset is fantastic.'",The teeth were among bones and decapitated heads found in a mass grave in Dorset .
"Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams claims there is no reason to 'panic' over the use of the niqab . Primary school teachers should be allowed to wear Muslim veils in the classroom, according to the former Archbishop of Canterbury. Rowan Williams claims that there is no reason to ‘panic’ over the use of the niqab and that even young children do not necessarily need to be able to see their teacher’s face. Speaking in an interview for the Christian think-tank Theos he argued that there fears over how such a practise might affect children’s learning were ‘misplaced.’ He said: ‘I’ve actually been in public discussions in Pakistan with women wearing full face veil, and you learn to read differently, it’s not that those codes don’t happen … but there’s a cultural obstacle to overcome. ‘As a matter of fact I think that’s largely a misplaced anxiety, but I can see where it comes from.’ His comments are set to reignite the row over the role of the controversial full-face veil in public life which have rumbled on for years. Last year Home Office minster Jeremy Browne called for a national discussion about their use in some settings such as schools, fearing that young women in some Islamic faith schools might have the veil imposed on them against their will. David Cameron rejected the idea of a ban but said he would ‘back up’ schools and courts that ask women to remove veils. The row continued when it emerged that a number of NHS hospitals had secretly banned female staff from covering their faces, followed by an admission from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt that he would not personally want to be treated by someone wearing a veil. In January this year, Rebekah Dawson, 22, made legal history by becoming the first woman allowed to go on trial wearing a veil. Rebekah Dawson, pictured at court earlier this year, made legal history by becoming the first woman allowed to go on trial wearing a veil . A judge initially allowed the jobless Muslim fanatic to wear her niqab during her six-day trial for witness intimidation after ruling that the court should recognise ‘freedom of religious expression’. But when the jury were discharged after failing to reach a verdict Miss Dawson admitted the charges – to the fury of many groups who accused her of making a mockery of British justice. The issue re-surfaced again this summer when a top London state school banned a 16-year-old student from starting her A levels unless she removed her niqab. Camden School for Girls is famous for its liberal approach to education. But despite a petition from more than 700 friends and fellow pupils it ruled that students wearing the traditional face-covering breached its ‘appearance policy’, which stipulates that students’ dress must allow teachers to interact with them. In 2008 Lord Williams caused widespread fury with his suggestion that it would be unavoidable for some aspects of Sharia law be adopted in the UK.","Rowan Williams says there is no reason to 'panic' over the use of the niqab .

"The world's largest coffee chain, Starbucks, and the country's biggest donut company, Dunkin Donuts, are ramping up efforts to compete with bars and restaurants by expanding their evening and light bite choices to 'thousands of stores'. Desperate to attract customers after the morning rush is over, both chains are frantically adding to their menus in the hope that people will see them as an option for lunch and even dinner. Starbucks first offered beer and wine after 4 p.m. at one of its Seattle cafes in 2010 and the Starbucks Evenings concept is now available in 32 cafes in seven markets around the country. Not just for coffee anymore: Starbucks is ramping up efforts to compete with bars and restaurants by expanding its evening alcohol and light bites to 'thousands of select stores' over the next several years . For my first course: The Starbucks Evenings concept is currently available in 32 cafes, with plans to reach 40 by the end of the year . The cafes also serve a variety of small dishes ranging in price from $3 to $5, such as bacon-wrapped dates, truffle macaroni and cheese, and flatbreads. In an attempt to keep the sales and profits flowing nearly around the clock, Dunkin Donuts is also planning to sell more dinner-friendly foods in 2015. 'Though breakfast remains our core, today people are seeking all-day dining, and they want to eat what they want, when they want it and where they want it - that's why we are so committed to menu innovation and giving our guests even more options that they can enjoy any time of day,' John Costello, Dunkin Donuts president, global marketing and innovation, said in an interview with TheStreet. Dunkin Donuts introduced steak this fall to make a steak sandwich and a wrap with eggs. Only 40% of Dunkin's sales come after 11 am, leaving a lot of room for growth. Coffee to stay? Dunkin Donuts has already begun to introduce a dinner staple -- steak -- this fall, recently making a steak sandwich and a wrap with eggs permanent additions to its menu . Not just for donuts anymore: With hardier menu items typically reserved for dinner, sales could grow at the more than 2,300 Dunkin Donuts in the U.S. that are open 24 hours . The concept is a common one in the restaurant industry - figuring out ways to maximize sales throughout the day, since stores have to pay for rent and labor anyway. Dunkin Donuts may draw inspiration for dinner from overseas. 'We have a variety of products and flavors that are tailored to the regional preferences of our guests around the world such as donuts stuffed, topped and glazed with everything from rice pudding to saffron to crushed pistachios in India,' Costello said . As for Starbucks, the chain recently introduced new sandwiches and salads to boost sales in the afternoon. Starbucks now offers 10 standard small plate options as part of its evening menu, such as truffle macaroni and cheese and double chocolate brownie bites. There are also five choices of red wine, three white wines, a sparkling rose and proseco. The expansion of Starbucks Evenings is similar to that of Dunkin's. The company wants to boost sales after the morning rush hour when people are getting their caffeine fix. During a shareholder update last week it was noted that the company's growth in food sales 'indicates that Starbucks is increasingly recognized by our customers as an attractive option for lunch.' Take your pick: As well as beer and wine, the cafes also serve a variety of small dishes ranging in price from $3 to $5, such as bacon-wrapped dates, truffle macaroni and cheese, and flatbreads . Starbucks also branching out into other areas to as it faces more competition in the coffee market. The company, which announced a long-term plan to almost double its market value to $100 billion yesterday, also is expanding and improving its rewards program and mobile applications. Last spring, Starbucks said it would soon test a way for customers to order items ahead of time with their smartphones. The company also recently purchased a chain of tea shops called Teavana. CEO Howard Schultz has said he wants to make tea as popular in the U.S. as he's helped make coffee.","The coffee chain is rolling out its Starbucks Evenings concept to 40 stores by the end of the year .

"Welfare and education reforms will ensure more Britons fill jobs which go to immigrants, David Cameron suggested today. The Prime Minister said the UK needs 'proper immigration control' with both the European Union and the rest of the world, but suggested changes were needed to prepare people to take the 'jobs that we are creating in our country today'. It comes as Greencore Group, the UK's biggest sandwich maker, plans to recruit hundreds of workers from Eastern Europe because no Britons will do the job. Scroll down for video . David Cameron today said the welfare system must be reformed so more Britons take jobs as part of efforts to tackle immigration . Mr Cameron has vowed to put freedom of movement 'at the heart' of his plans to claw powers back from Brussels. However, a string of EU leaders have raised objections to the idea of changes to what they see as a fundamental right across the 28-nation bloc. Home Secretary Theresa May insisted that there was a 'growing recognition' in European capitals of the need to reform freedom of movement rules, as she sought to downplay the Government's looming failure to meet a Conservative pledge on immigration. Mr Cameron promised to limit net migration to Britain to the tens of thousands 'no ifs, no buts'. Today Mrs May suggested it was not a promise, but only a 'comment'. Downing Street later stressed it remained an 'objective'. In a speech to the CBI today, Mr Cameron said that tighter immigration controls must be matched by reforms to the UK's welfare and education systems to enable British workers to fill the jobs currently done by foreigners. Last night it emerged Greencore Group, which supplies Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Asda, admits it will have to recruit most of the 300 workers it needs from Hungary. Allyson Russell, Greencore's human resources director, said the company had tried to recruit in the UK, but that it was 'not always the kind of work' which people wanted to do. The £35million factory, in Northampton, is due to open in early 2016. Mrs Russell said low unemployment meant few locals could be found to fill vacancies, although there are around 8,000 jobless in the town, a rate of 6.8 per cent – the national average – while in nearby Corby it is 9.5 per cent and Luton 8.7 per cent. The Prime Minister told the CBI conference that 'proper' controls on immigration were needed with the EU, and the rest of the world . In Hungary, the average wage is little more than £7,000. Even if workers coming here were on the minimum wage, they would earn almost double that – £13,520 a year. And they would have their wages topped up with tax credits – seen as a major attraction for EU migrants – and housing benefit. These mean a migrant with no dependants on the minimum wage has their net income of about £184 a week boosted to £254, studies have suggested. Mr Cameron suggest more needed to be done to the benefits system to persuade people living in the UK to take jobs on offer. He said: 'We need to have proper immigration control. We need to do more, both outside the European Union and, frankly, inside the European Union. 'But the flipside of the coin on immigration is a welfare system that rewards work and an education system that turns out people with the skills necessary to do the jobs that we are creating in our country today. 'No immigration policy will succeed unless it's accompanied by that welfare and that education reform as well.' The latest official figures showed 243,000 more migrants came to the UK than left in the year to March, up from 175,000 the previous year. Successful efforts to reduce arrivals from the rest of the world to 1990s' levels have been outweighed by a surge from the EU. The Prime Minister is due to set out detailed proposals for reforming freedom of movement rules before the end of the year in an attempt to reduce the flow. He has pledged to put Britain's EU membership to an in/out referendum in 2017 if the Conservatives form the next government in 2015. Greencore (pictured) say they have failed to attract many applications from potential employees in Northampton - so bosses are now travelling to Hungary to recruit some of the 300-strong workforce needed . German chancellor Angela Merkel has made clear she regards the principle of free movement of labour within the European Union as non-negotiable and is reported to have warned the Prime Minister that his drive is pushing Britain towards 'a point of no return' on the road to exit from Europe. Similar concerns were aired by northern European leaders at a summit in Finland last week, where Mr Cameron acknowledged there were 'different perspectives' but insisted there was 'common ground' on the need to reform. Mrs May told BBC Radio 4's Today: 'What I have seen over the last few years - because I have been talking about freedom of movement for some time in Europe - is a growing recognition from other countries that actually there are issues. 'It is possible to get change in this area. There is a growing concern across the European Union of the way in which free movement is being used. We are seeing it being abused, possibly by criminal gangs that are trafficking human beings, we are seeing it being abused through sham marriages.' Mr Cameron promised to cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands' but latest figures show the figure standing at 243,000 . Asked about other member states' concerns, she said: 'They have been clear about the principle of freedom of movement. I wouldn't expect them to be anything otherwise. 'We are going to be going into a negotiation that would lead to a referendum in 2017 ... you wouldn't expect everybody to be giving everything away to us at this stage.' In a 2011 speech setting out his immigration target, Mr Cameron said levels would be cut to manageable levels - 'No ifs, no buts'. But ministers have been forced to concede that now looks a near-impossibility. Asked about it, Mrs May said: 'When we made that, er, comment... we said we would be aiming to bring the net migration down to the tens of thousands and we wanted to do that within this parliament. Yes, we were very clear that's what we wanted to do.'","Prime Minister insists welfare and education reforms needed to boost work .

"A former Christian radio host from Michigan was sentenced Monday to 25-50 years in prison for performing vile sex acts on a young boy. John Balyo, 35, was arrested in a June as part of a sex trafficking ring bust, and in September he pleaded guilty to having sex with an 11-year-old boy in a Battle Creek hotel. Balyo, a former host at the WCSG station in Grand Rapids, will spend a minimum of 25 years behind bars, receiving credit for 143 days served in jail. Vile crime: Former Christian radio DJ John Balyo, 35, (pictured with an unidentified child), was sentenced to 25-50 years for having sex with a minor in May . The sentence will run concurrent with the prison term he is expected to receive in December on federal charges of child pornography and sexual exploitation. If he lives long enough to be released from prison, Balyo will be required to register as a sex offender and wear an electronic monitor for the rest of his life, Battle Creek Inquirer reported. ‘I just want to take this opportunity to say I am feeling very deep and constant remorse for my actions,’ Balyo said in court Monday. ‘And I want the family to know I am very sorry and wish I could do something to correct what has been done.’ The victim’s mother wrote in an impact statement, which was read to the court during the sentencing hearing, saying that children should be loved and respected, not ‘used and abused’ by adults. ‘No child should be scared of people or of life itself,’ the woman stated. ‘I think you should sit and rot in jail the rest of your miserable life.’ In August, Balyo pleaded guilty to photographing sex acts with the 11-year-old in May after paying him, then handcuffing the child to a bed. The boy's family were in court for the August plea hearing in Grand Rapids and wept as details of sexual assault were heard, Freep.com reported. Act of contrition: Balyo, (pictured in his June mugshot), apologized to his victim's family during the sentencing . Balyo told the court: 'I did take images of a child and they were sexually explicit involving bondage and nudity. I performed sex acts as described. I knew it was wrong.' The 35-year-old was a host at WCSG until his arrest in June at the Big Ticket Christian music festival in Gaylord, Michigan. Balyo admitted in June that he had a rented storage unit where he kept a 'bondage kit' of handcuffs, chains and duct tape, a federal spokesman confirmed to MailOnline. It is claimed that Balyo paid a man to arrange a sex session with a minor for him. Handcuffs and other items were found in a suitcase after police searched a storage unit in Plainfield Township. A padlock, rubber gloves and children's socks were also seized, MLive reported. Balyo additionally had piles of articles about missing children and children's obituaries, it was reported, along with an erotic photography magazine. Balyo is married and has a stepson, according to the Christian Post. Balyo tied the knot around the same time he committed the sex crime. The DJ allegedly paid resident Ronald Moser, 41, to have sex with a young boy through a website he ran. Authorities who raided Moser's property on June 5 found him at a home with a boy. According to Mlive.com, in a photo album allegedly posted online by Moser, there were ten images of a young boy lying face down on a bed. His hands and feet were bound and he was wearing only underwear, which had been rolled up to show his buttocks, according to a federal agent. The albums had titles such as 'very cute boy,' and 'sexy boys', police said. The FBI said Moser put images online and planned to trade in child porn. It is alleged that Moser ran a website providing sex with underage boys for money. The investigation into the alleged pedophiles has involved multiple agencies as part of a larger 'Operation Predator'. Balyo was fired from his job at WCSG and the station publicly asked for prayers for the former host, his family and alleged victims. The 35-year-old had been at the radio station for eight years.","John Balyo, 35, got 25-50 years in prison for sex acts with a child .

"A Nasa spacecraft orbiting the red planet has found the 'strongest indication' that liquid water may still exist on the Martian surface. Images taken by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal 'finger-like' markings on Martian slopes. Experts say that although they do not yet have a 'smoking gun', they believe the markings are made by minerals which could not have left without flowing liquid. Dark, seasonal flows emanate from bedrock exposures at Palikir Crater on Mars in this image from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Astronomers believe the dark 'fingers' above hold the key to water on Mars. Known as 'recurring slope lineae' or RSL for short, they are dark lines that are observed moving down the slopes of some Martian mountains as temperatures on the surface rise. Experts believe these flows might be caused by saltwater containing a iron sulfate solution to keep it from freezing in Martian temperatures. 'The features are dark, finger-like markings that advance down some Martian slopes when temperatures rise,' Nasa said. The new clues include corresponding seasonal changes in iron minerals on the same slopes and a survey of ground temperatures and other traits at active sites. These support a suggestion that brines with an iron-mineral antifreeze, such as ferric sulfate, may flow seasonally, though there are still other possible explanations. Researchers call these dark flows 'recurring slope lineae'. 'We still don't have a smoking gun for existence of water in RSL, although we're not sure how this process would take place without water,' said Lujendra Ojha, a graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, and lead author of two new reports about these flows. He originally discovered them while an undergraduate at the University of Arizona, Tucson, three years ago, in images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Ojha and Georgia Tech assistant professor James Wray more recently looked at 13 confirmed RSL sites using images from the same orbiter's Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument. They found 'distinct and consistent' spectral signatures of ferric and ferrous minerals at most of the sites. 'Just like the RSL themselves, the strength of the spectral signatures varies according to the seasons,' said Ojha. River on Mars? This image combines a photograph of seasonal dark flows on a Martian slope with a grid of colors based on data collected by a mineral-mapping spectrometer observing the same area. Nasa believes it could reveal salty liquid water. The purple and pink colors of the image represent spectra with absorption of light at wavelengths of 920 nanometers and 530 nanometer, which the researchers say indicate a concentration of ferric iron, and a clue that water flows in the area. 'They're stronger when it's warmer and less significant when it's colder.' These results are in a paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. The leading hypothesis for these features is the flow of near-surface water, kept liquid by salts depressing the freezing point of pure water. 'The flow of water, even briny water, anywhere on Mars today would be a major discovery, impacting our understanding of present climate change on Mars and possibly indicating potential habitats for life near the surface on modern Mars,' said Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Project Scientist Richard Zurek, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In a seperate paper, by Georgia Tech scientists and colleagues at the University of Arizona; U.S. Geological Survey, Flagstaff, Ariz.; and Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, a team used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter to look for patterns in where and when the dark seasonal flows exist on Mars. Their results indicate that many sites with slopes, latitudes and temperatures matching known RSL sites do not have any evident RSL. 'NASA likes to 'follow the water' in exploring the Red Planet, so we'd like to know in advance when and where it will appear,' Professor James Wray said. 'RSL have rekindled our hope of accessing modern water, but forecasting wet conditions remains a challenge.'","Images taken by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal 'finger-like' markings that may have been left by salt water .

"They are heavily armed and known for carrying out dangerous and remote pursuits in night time helicopter raids. But for the first Navy SEALs that would have been something of a luxury as they landed on beaches in the dark on two-man motorised rafts dubbed 'flying mattresses'. Often members were only armed with knives and wore nothing but swimming trunks and flippers as they carried out seaborne clandestine missions during the Second World War. Scroll down for video . Two combat swimmers from the Maritime Unit of the Office of Strategic Services can been seen during a training exercise in 1944, where they are on one of the raft's dubbed a 'flying mattress' in just their trunks . Frank Monteleone, 89, was a member of an elite commando force within the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) - the precursor to the CIA. Created after the United States entered Second World War, the OSS pioneered many of the intelligence-gathering techniques and commando-style tactics used by today's U.S. Special Forces. The spy agency's Maritime Unit, formed in 1943, shares the credit for setting the foundation for what would become the Navy SEALs, created during the Kennedy administration in 1962. Head of the OSS, William 'Wild Bill' Donovan - a Wall Street lawyer - recruited yachtsmen, Olympic-calibre swimmers and California's 'beach rats' - lifeguards and surfers. The son of Italian immigrants, Mr Monteleone was recruited by the OSS because he spoke fluent Italian and was trained as a Navy radio operator. He said he went through 'all kinds of training' with the services, including demolition and hand-to-hand combat, but had missed out on parachute training - a must for any OSS operator. Frank Monteleone, 89, was a member of an elite commando force within the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Once in the Mediterranean Theatre of operations, his detachment was assigned to the British Eighth Army. Mr Monteleone, now a retired tailor living in Staten Island, New York, said: 'When they sent me to the British, they wanted to know if I had jump training. I said no, and they gave it to me right then and there.' He explained how he conducted dangerous missions nearly the entire length of Italy, from the beaches at Anzio to the Alps, often working with Italian partisans behind the lines. Some of the missions entailed landing on beaches at night using the inflated craft that resembled mattresses and were powered by silent electrical motors. Mr Monteleone and his Italian comrades named the teardrop-shaped vessel 'tartuga,' which is Italian for turtle. Combat swimmer Lt. John Booth is seen wearing a rebreather, a precursor to SCUBA during a training exercise and features in new book, 'First SEALs: The Untold Story of the Forging of America's Most Elite Unit' Members of the combat swimmers and other operatives conduct an operation in the South Pacific in 1945  to provide reconnaissance and demolition missions that allowed the Navy to land on key islands during the war . His story along with others is told in a new book entitled 'First SEALS: The Untold Story of the Forging of America's Most Elite Unit' and reveals what it was like to be a member of the early commando force. Its release comes as a member of the SEAL team that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 chose to waive his anonymity and went public with his role in taking down the terrorist leader in Pakistan. Frank Monteleone, centre, pictured with other members of the Maritime Unit, attached to the British Eighth Army . Rob O'Neill, a highly-decorated veteran who quit after 16 years service, has chosen to given an interview to Fox News - due to be broadcast later this month. O'Neill claims to be 'The Shooter' and said he shot him three times 'just for luck'. The book's author, Patrick K. O'Donnell said he had always wanted to write a book on the early Navy SEALs. 'The bin Laden raid was sort of the culmination of what all these men had built from 1943 to 1945,' he said. O'Donnell, who has written eight previous books on Second World War military and intelligence history, had met Mr Monteleone 15 years ago while researching a book on the OSS. Speaking of Mr Monteleone's role in the war, he said: 'The radio operator was the key to the mission. If you could not send and receive information on missions behind the lines, you were dead.' Approximately 13,000 people served in the OSS during the war, but only a few hundred were in the Maritime Unit and O'Donnell believes Mr Monteleone may be one of the last still living. Another member included in the book is Gordon Soltau, a combat swimmer considered one of the Navy's first 'frogmen.' Mr Soltau, who starred for the San Francisco 49ers during the 1950s, died in California at 89 on October 26, just days before the new book was published.

"Rod Stewart has shrugged off the complaints of a fan whose nose was broken by a soccer ball the singer booted into the audience at a Las Vegas concert. When TMZ questioned Stewart about the alleged injury, the singer - who is a long-time soccer fan and plays regularly - responded coolly: 'It's a contact sport.' A 53-year-old Southern California man who says he has lingering injuries after his nose was broken by the ball has filed a lawsuit seeking unspecified damages of at least $10,000. Scroll down for video . Rod Stewart pictured performing at the Vina del Mar International Festival, Chile, this February. The kicking of soccer balls into the audience, usually during the song Hot Legs, has long been a part of Stewart's shows . Mostafa Kashe's civil negligence complaint alleges that he didn't expect to be hit in the face by a ball kicked by the raspy-voiced British singer from the stage during a show at the Caesars Palace resort in October 2012. The complaint dwells mainly on Stewart's footballing skills. 'Stewart has significant experience in the sport of soccer and experience in kicking soccer balls, having previously tried out for a professional soccer team in the UK and regularly playing in amateur soccer leagues since his youth,' it states. 'Stewart either knew or should have known that his actions could cause injury to unsuspecting patrons of his concerts.' Mostafa Kashe claims Stewart intentionally kick​ed the soccer ball into the audience with 'sufficient force so as to potentially injure patrons' The singer is known to be passionate about the sport, and even has a professional-standard pitch in the garden of his Essex home, where he plays regularly. Stewart, 69, also has his own seat in the directors’ box of Celtic FC, where he famously Rod Stewart wept tears of joy after his team beat Barcelona in 2012. He even had trials with Brentford FC, then a Third Division club, after leaving school in the early 1960s,and was rumored to have been signed up as an apprentice. Mr Kashe claims that the British rock star intentionally kick​ed the soccer ball into the audience with 'sufficient force so as to potentially injure patrons,' according to the lawsuit filed in Clark County Court​ in Nevada​. His claim is apparently based on lost wages and legal and medical fees. The kicking of soccer balls into the audience, usually during the song Hot Legs, has long been a part of Stewart's shows. 'The show wouldn't be the show if I stopped kicking out those footballs,' he has said. The balls, which Stewart usually autographs, are often resold. Representatives of Stewart, promoter AEG Live and Caesars Entertainment Corp, did not immediately comment  on the lawsuit filed against them. Yesterday, Michael Roth, of AEG Live, said his firm had not yet been served with the complaint.

"Photos of the squalid conditions of a house at the centre of an abuse investigation detail the shocking living environment of children who went unnoticed by authorities. The 'House of Horrors' in Adelaide's Parafield Gardens was home to 21 children who suffered through starvation and torture. The South Australian Housing Trust home was uncovered by police, who found the children living among walls smeared with faeces and smelling of urine, and infestations of flies, maggots and cockroaches, reported The Advertiser. Scroll down for video . Photos of the squalid conditions of a house at the centre of an abuse investigation detail the shocking living environment of children who went unnoticed by authorities . The 'House of Horrors' in Adelaide's Parafield Gardens was home to 21 children who suffered through starvation and torture . The children who were aged between four and seven were discovered in 2008, and the ringleaders of the abuse were sentenced in 2011. The children had been starved to the point of malnutrition, with examinations showing that their brains had shrunk from the deprivation to basic nutrients. All five children were were found to have ulcers on their legs and feet, were covered with scabies, and had stunted growth. The Casuarina Drive house smelled of urine, and a dead dog was found rotting in the yard, reported The Australian. Justice Kevin Duggan said that the manner with which the children had been treated was 'beyond comprehension', reported The Telegraph. More shocking images surfaced from another house in Adelaide last month where a mother a four-year-old boy, who weighed just 8.3kg when he was discovered by police, was 'too busy having sex' to properly care for her son . The mother posted images on Facebook of cooking roast beef and chocolate dessert as her starving son was locked in his bedroom . The toilet is surrounded by used toilet paper while the boy was confined to a small room full of soiled nappies . The 28-year-old father and the 24-year-old mother pleaded guilty to an aggravated charge of endangering their son's life . More shocking images surfaced from another house in Adelaide last month where a mother a four-year-old boy, who weighed just 8.3kg when he was discovered by police, was 'too busy having sex' to properly care for her son, The Adelaide District Court heard on October 28. The 24-year-old woman told police she was preoccupied with her partner and put him before her toddler, who was discovered just days from death and is now in foster care. The images of the trashed house reveal the rooms pile high with rubbish and filth littered throughout the home while the child was fed under his locked door and lived in a small room full of soiled nappies. The court heard the young victim, who is now in foster care, still hides food in his pockets, hates doors being closed and is not yet toilet trained. Doctors said the boy’s dehydration level was at 10 percent and was two days away from reaching a critical level of 15 percent. Prosecutors have called for a lengthy jail sentence after the 28-year-old father and the 24-year-old mother pleaded guilty to an aggravated charge of endangering their son's life. They will be sentenced in December. The South Australian Housing Trust home was uncovered by police, who found the children living among faeces, and infestations of flies, maggots and cockroaches . The children had been starved to the point of malnutrition, with examinations showing that their brains had shrunk from the deprivation to basic nutrients . All five children were were found to have ulcers on their legs and feet, were covered with scabies, and had stunted growth . The children were reportedly made to stand in a line for hours with their hands on their heads, beaten if they requested more than the scraps of food they were given, and their hands tied with sticky tape at night to prevent them from obtaining more to eat. The abuses were discovered by authorities when one of the young boys was taken to the Lyell McEwan Hospital after fainting from malnutrition and hypothermia. 'It reached the point where the children were made to stand in the same position from morning to night,' said the Adelaide Supreme Court judge. 'The adults were vigilant to make sure they were prevented from eating anything more.' Justice Duggan said that the house was 'not fit for habitation'. 'The deteriorating condition of the children must have been evident to every adult in the household, he said. The children had only recently moved to Adelaide from Geelong in Victoria, reported The Advertiser, and so little information had reached authorities, who said that there was almost no evidence of the children's existence. The alleged ringleader was Tania Staker, now 39, a mother of 14, was sentenced to 10 years in jail, and the children's father Luke Armistead, now 51, was jailed for nine years. Mr Armistead's stepfather Robert Armistead, now 44, and Ms Staker's brother, Michael Quinlivan, now 30, were jailed for nine years on three counts of endangering life and two counts of creating a risk of serious harm.

It has been alleged by one of the victims of the abuse that a welfare worker, in the employ of Families SA and was aware that the children were living in the squalid conditions, failed to alert authorities, reported news.com.au. A child protection worker, who is now engaged to a relative of one of the men charged in the case, reportedly visited the house on many occasions, but would not enter and instead sat outside. The welfare worker was not under any legal obligations to report the conditions as she was not officially assigned to any cases involving the property. 'The first couple of times she visited ... she was friends of the adults ... she had been inside the house,' said the woman. 'Other times she came, she would only sit out the front of the house.' Five years after the discovery of the house, the South Australian government released a response to the recommendations made by Child Death and Serious Injury Committee. There was allegedly 'almost no information known about the children to state authorities' until the boy was taken to hospital, said Committee chairwoman Deej Eszenyi. Different agencies including Families SA had records of the children, and Ms Eszenyi said that if the different body had shared information more might been done sooner. 'There was a possibility that the house might have been entered before the crimes against these children occurred,' she said.

"It's known as the beautiful game, but in Tudor times football should perhaps have been called the dangerous game. Modern Premier League stars may dive and feign injuries, but in the 16th century more people died playing it than sword-fighting, a historian has discovered. Seven footballers were killed after clashes in English villages between 1500 and 1575, new research has revealed. Violent clash: Football matches were more like American Football matches - but without the padding. Games in Tudor times would involve dozens of players and last for hours . Records show the sport was more violent with physical clashes and contact resulting in people being badly injured and accidentally crushed. The game involved dozens of players competing against one another. Players would clash violently in a sport that was similar in style to American football - but without the padding. The facts have been . uncovered by Oxford University historian Dr Steven Gunn, who examined . Tudor coroner’s records for information. As part of a wider project into . accidental deaths in the 16th century, he found a significant proportion . of deaths came from sport and recreation. Although the modern game was born in the late 19th century, the origins of football go back centuries. The first recorded game took place in London in 1170 and was recorded by William FitzStephen. Matches would spring up on an ad-hoc basis across the country. The violent fixtures would go on for hours  if not days and deaths were not uncommon. Some historians have said the sport was first started as a war game and was often played between villages. It is believed that although it was called football, players could pick the ball up and run with it as well as kick it. Edward II banned the sport in 1314 because he was concerned men were more interested in it than archery. However, it was ignored and prosecutions were rare so the game continued to flourish. Despite repeated attempts to crackdown on the sport the game was never killed off. When Eton and universities started playing the game it started becoming more gentlemanly. But it was not until 1857 that the first football club - Sheffield FC - were found. They are still in existence. The Sheffield Code - the world's oldest football rule-book - was written a year later in 1858 and is seen as the basis of the modern game. Back then matches lasted for two hours and 40 players were involved. The English Football League was founded in 1888 and Preston North End were the first winners. Football was the second most dangerous sport during the period - beaten only by the death toll of 56 from archery. It was followed in joint third place by wrestling, sword-fighting and - oddly - bell ringing, which each caused three deaths. Other notably dangerous sports included hammer throwing, which caused two deaths, and quoits, which caused one. Quiots is a northern game which involves throwing a ring towards a set target. In one of the record uncovered, from February 20, 1523 in Allerston, North Yorkshire, said a football player died as he challenged for the ball. The entry read: 'John Langbern of Allerston was playing football with Roger Bridkirk of Allerston, labourer, and many others. 'They were running after a certain ball called the ""foteball"", no malice being between them, and both came to the ball at once and fell to the ground. 'Roger fell on top of John and crushed his body by misfortune, so that John immediately died.' Of the seven footballers to die while playing the game, two men were accidentally stabbed with a knife in the process of tackling an opponent. Others suffered internal injuries from hefty falls while one player died from a broken leg. On February 20, 1508 Thomas Bryan was playing in Yeovilton, Somerset, and had his knife hanging from his belt and was killed. The record states: 'He fell onto it by misfortune, it struck him in the body and he immediately died. So he killed himself by misfortune.' In a bizarre death, a man was killed after being pulled into the air as he rang a bell before plunging to the floor. In an entry from Preston, Suffolk, on August 22, 1568 it was recorded: 'Adam Strutt was in the bell-tower of the church. 'He . rang ""the thirde bell"", pulling a rope attached to the wheel of the . bell, but the rope caught round his feet and pulled him seven feet off . the ground, from which height he fell head-first onto the paved floor of . the bell-tower. 'He languished until 6pm on August 23, when he died. 'The . bell, rope and wheel, which remain in custody of inhabitants of Preston . and are worth 13s 4d, were the cause of the accident.' Perhaps unsurprisingly, wrestling was also a dangerous sport with participants dying from accidental but predictable wounds. Modern game: Tudor football is a far cry from the almost contact-free modern game. Here England's Ashley Young is booked for diving . In one bizarre accident, on October 31, 1518, a John Homler was playing and wrestling in the churchyard at Skeckling near Burstwick in Holderness, Easty Yorks, with Thomas Tenyson and William Lamrose. Records show: 'Stephen Kayngham of Skeckling, husbandman, came to them and said that he was a manly man who could throw all three of them over the churchyard wall. 'John Homler said that he could not. Stephen Kayngham took John Homler and without malice or ill-will took him and put him over the churchyard wall. 'John Homler fell to the ground and his knife, which was sticking out of its sheath, by great misfortune pierced a vein under the elbow in his right arm to the depth of an inch and his blood flowed out copiously.' Archery was the sport that led to most deaths. An entry on June 2, 1542 in Lowick, Northamptonshire, states: 'Alexander Godbye sat on the churchyard wall watching archers shooting at targets next to the wall. Old game: An artists impression of wealthy boys from the Tudor era playing football . 'They warned him several times to get down lest he get hit, but he would not. 'John Fryssby’s arrow struck him on the left side of the head and he languished until 12 June, when he died.' Dr Steven Gunn, from Merton College, Oxford, said it was surprising how in-depth the records were. Danger: 56 people were killed by archery in the Tudor era, the researcher found . He said: 'It’s remarkable what you can work out by examining coroner’s records. The level of detail in some of them is surprising. 'The most dangerous sport by far was archery, but there are other more unusual sports which resulted in death too. 'Football was cited in seven cases we have found. Of course there may have been more, but we are limited to the surviving records. 'From what we have read, football seems to have been a violent sport, played in a similar way to American football nowadays but without the protective clothing. 'Water was also very dangerous. Few people could swim and there was a high number of accidental drownings during the period. 'The records can also tell us a great deal about people’s lives, including when they took part in sport or recreation. 'For example, six out of the seven deaths from football occurred in February while most of the archery accidents happened in May, June or July. 'Accidents involving football, wrestling or throwing games were more likely to happen on a Sunday than a working day or holiday. 'It is all part of a wider project into accidental deaths in the 16th century, which we hope will lead to a better understanding of everyday life at that time.'","Seven recorded football deaths between 1500 and 1575 .

"The BBC website led yesterday afternoon with a claim from Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable that by publishing the material the Guardian had done a 'considerable public service' The BBC was accused last night of siding with the Guardian in its coverage of criticism of the newspaper’s release of top-secret documents. The corporation’s website led yesterday afternoon with a claim from Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable that by publishing the material the Guardian had done a ‘considerable public service’. The headline echoed wording used on the newspaper’s live blog. That read: ‘NSA files – Guardian has done “considerable public service”, says Vince Cable.’ The BBC story also initially buried former Home Secretary Jack Straw’s damaging attack on the Guardian over the secret documents. Mr Straw had made the comments to a BBC outlet and they appeared to have emerged after Mr Cable had spoken on the flagship BBC Radio 4 Today programme yesterday at 8.10am. The Labour grandee’s powerful intervention was not mentioned at all on last night’s Six O’Clock News. Their story instead led on David Cameron being ‘ready to listen’ on the issue of improving political oversight of security services, while ruling out a review. On Thursday, the Today programme failed to ask Home Secretary Theresa May about the Guardian row when she was interviewed in the same slot. Later in the day she was asked about it in separate BBC interviews and said the revelations had given ‘some comfort to terrorists’. Robert Halfon, the Tory MP for Harlow, said: ‘It’s incredibly sad that our national broadcaster has seemingly chosen to side with the Guardian and impose a news blackout on an alleged major threat to our national security by a national newspaper.’ All week commentators have lambasted the BBC for its failure to give the story due prominence. Vince Cable appeared top on the BBC website yesterday afternoon . All week commentators have lambasted the BBC for its failure to give the story due prominence . On Tuesday, when the story broke, the main news at 10pm led with MI5 director general Andrew Parker’s speech but made no mention of the key claim that the left-wing newspaper’s publication of GCHQ secrets had done ‘enormous damage’. This prompted MPs to claim BBC journalists were ‘protecting their Left-wing friends’. The following morning, bulletins on BBC Radio 4 failed to mention the newspaper at all although it was mention in later reports. The BBC did not change its online coverage of the story on Wednesday to reflect criticism of the Guardian until the newspaper’s editor, Alan Rusbridger, publicly defended its actions. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We completely reject any suggestion that our reporting has been biased. ‘From the outset we have given this story a high profile and robustly questioned all the protagonists involved, representing a range of views as they have emerged including the new angles today, which were the comments from Vince Cable and Jack Straw.’","BBC website led yesterday with a claim by Vince Cable that the Guardian had done a 'considerable public service' by publishing secret material .

"Suffering with an aching back, or even morning sickness? Don’t be surprised  if your GP suggests acupuncture. More than half of British doctors have prescribed it, according to one survey, and the NHS spends about £25 million on it. Acupuncture is based on the ancient belief that inserting needles into the body restores energy balance, while Western practitioners say the needles trigger production of pain-killing chemicals. Sceptics, however, say much of the supposed benefit is down to a placebo effect. Here we take a look at the conditions where this alternative treatment shows most promise... Point blank: Believers in the therapy says acupuncture stimulates the body's natural painkillers . BACK PAIN . THE EVIDENCE The evidence for acupuncture relieving back pain has been so compelling that the government health watchdog NICE now recommends it. In some areas, this is provided by the NHS. A major review of 29 studies last year by Andrew Vickers, an epidemiologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, found acupuncture had a clear and ‘robust’ effect on chronic back pain. EXPERT COMMENT ‘Most of the  evidence that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence uses is for lower back pain, but acupuncture can be useful for neck and shoulder pain too,’ says Dr Tom Margham, a GP and spokesman for the charity Arthritis Research UK. ‘Just as with any other treatment, some people have a better response than others. Many physiotherapists use it as part of a suite  of treatments, alongside exercises.’ DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY . Suspicious: Sceptics say much of it the benefits of acupuncture are down to a placebo effect . THE EVIDENCE A 2012 review of studies in the Canadian Journal Of Psychiatry suggested acupuncture can be an effective, safe treatment for mild to moderate depression. But a Cochrane review in 2010 concluded that most trials have found no evidence of acupuncture reducing the symptoms of depression. The researchers did find proof of an effect on depression after a stroke. EXPERT COMMENT ‘I don’t think acupuncture works for depression, but I do think  it’s good for anxiety and insomnia,’ says Dr Jamil. ‘Acupuncture increases levels of endorphins, the body’s natural feelgood hormones.’ MORNING SICKNESS . THE EVIDENCE Between 50 and  80 per cent of women will experience nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy. One trial of 600 women by Dr Caroline Smith, an acupuncture practitioner at the University of Western Sydney, found their morning sickness symptoms reduced significantly after weekly, 20-minute sessions of acupuncture for four weeks. There is also a growing body of evidence that acupuncture can help with nausea after surgery or chemotherapy. A review of 40 studies published by the respected Cochrane Collaboration in 2009 found 25 per cent of patients suffering nausea  after an operation would benefit from wrist acupuncture. EXPERT COMMENT Fertility expert Zita West is a trained acupuncturist and recommends the treatment for morning sickness. ‘Pregnancy is a time when women don’t want to take any drugs, and are looking for a natural route,’ she says. ‘Acupuncture can  help – usually on a pressure point known as pericardium 6, which is inside the wrist.’ Dr Jamil often gives wrist acupuncture to patients before surgery to lower the risk of nausea from general anaesthetic. HEADACHES . THE EVIDENCE . The recent study by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center found . acupuncture was twice as effective for chronic headache as medication. A . review of 22 trials by Technical University Munich in 2009 found . frequent headache sufferers had an average 50 per cent fewer episodes . after treatment with acupuncture.  NICE now recommends acupuncture for . tension headaches and migraine. No pain in the brain:  A 2009 study fount that those suffering from frequent headache halved their episodes after treatment with acupuncture . EXPERT COMMENT ‘Everyone with migraine should try acupuncture,’ says Dr Tanvil Jamil, an NHS GP at Burnham Health Centre, Buckinghamshire. ‘It’s fantastic – often if a patient’s taking migraine tablets, they’ll find they only have to take them very infrequently or may even come off them completely.’ ARTHRITIS . THE EVIDENCE A report published  by Arthritis UK earlier this year  found ‘consistent evidence’ that acupuncture can ease symptoms of osteoarthritis – although it doesn’t work on rheumatoid arthritis. A review carried out in 2007 by the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth found that acupuncture improved  pain and function in patients with chronic knee problems. EXPERT COMMENT ‘NICE haven’t recommended acupuncture for osteoarthritis but that’s not to say it won’t help, as their decisions are based on cost benefit,’ says Dr Margham. ‘If you’re stuck for options, it is a safe thing to consider. Try it for a limited time and see if it helps.’ MAKE SURE YOU GET A REGISTERED PRACTITIONER . HOW DO I CHOOSE  AN ACUPUNCTURIST? If acupuncture is available on the NHS in your area, your GP may refer you. If you want to find a private practitioner, ensure they are registered with the British Acupuncture Council. ‘Check if they are registered on our website, acupuncture.org.uk,’ says Maureen Cromey, spokesman for the BAcC. The best thing to do is get a recommendation from a friend, then check they are qualified and call them for a chat or drop in. You need to feel comfortable with them and communicate with them.’ It’s also possible to search for qualified acupuncturists in your local area on the BAcC website. Once you decide to go  ahead, the practitioner will carry out a full consultation before starting treatment. HOW MANY SESSIONS  WILL I NEED? Ms Cromey recommends  starting with one or two sessions and seeing what the effect is. ‘Most people start to feel different after their first session,’ she says. ‘Just go with the practitioner’s advice.’ DOES IT HURT? Acupuncture is no more  painful than the feeling of plucking out a hair, says Ms Cromey. ‘It doesn’t hurt. You might feel a bit of anticipation  at first, but once you’ve had it once or twice you’ll know  what to expect. If you’ve got  a real needle phobia, you  might want to consider a different treatment.’","More than half of British doctors have prescribe acupuncture .

"One of the most legendary horror homes to feature in the movies: the house with the scariest basement in America, from Nightmare On Elm Street, appears to now be in a dreamlike state. The house that Freddy Krueger haunted is actually on North Genesee Avenue in Los Angeles. It was a delightful suburban cottage when it appeared in the film, but it fell into neglect by the previous family who owned it who left the house to fall apart. It recent years it has undergone an extensive renovation turning it into something more akin to a dream home than haunted house. Scroll down for video... Dream house: After a massive renovation this famous Los Angeles home sold for $2.1 million in 2013 . Scary: The house looked far less appealing when it made an appearance in 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' Lounging: Besides a totally redone interior and exterior, the backyard features a plush garden and stunning pool . Unworried about its history of cinematic terror, Angie Hill purchased the house in 2008 for $1.15 million and spent a year renovating the property. Initially, the home bore a greater resemblance to the decrepit and decaying version in Freddy's dream world than the original sunny suburban home that shows up in the early films. 'It was horrible,' Hill said. 'It was the only house on the street that looked beaten up.... The pool looked like it hadn't been touched in 10 years - it was black.' Paint was chipping and cracks were showing all over the home's exterior, and the concrete patio in the backyard was breaking apart. Asking price: The house sold for the full asking price of $2.1 million only seven years after the deteriorating house sold for $1.15 million . All new: For the renovation, designers fused modern and traditional elements replacing every piece of wood and redoing the floor plan . Pleasant dreams: The new owners will have their choice of three huge bedrooms each with its own private bath . Modern: The newly redone house is filled with state-of-the-art furnishing and appliances . 'It had the weirdest vibe,' Hill said. 'You could feel the weird energy. There was a really oppressive odor.' So she burned some sage to get ready of the bad energy, and then completely dismantled the property. First, she burned sage to clear the energy in the house, she said. Then, she took apart 90 percent of the entire home - walls, ceilings, the roof - and replaced them. Inside, it's now a striking piece of traditional/modernist fusion that neither Freddy Krueger nor Nancy Thompson would recognize, as shown in a 2012 listing for the property. It sold in 2013 for $2.1 million - a few hundred thousand dollars more than it cost director Wes Craven to make the original 'Nightmare' movie. 'I replaced every piece of wood and reconfigured the floor plan,' recalled Hill. 'I ripped off half the house.' Only a portion of the exterior shell of the house remained intact while she gut-renovated every room. Shower scene: The house features 3.25 bathrooms without even counting the one in the guest house . The work was so extensive that it took nearly a year to complete before she could officially move in. The front exterior of the house still looks mostly the same as it did in 'Elm Street,' with a striking red door. Cult followers of the classic horror film still recognize it today. 'People stop and take pictures, and there's a tour bus that goes by three times a day,' Hill said. 'Sometimes people come to the door and say stupid things like, 'Do you know what house this is?' ' She admits, the home's fictional history of horror still has a very real effect on her. Although there was no nightmare villain hanging out in the property, it still gave Hill the creeps. 'I used to be afraid to go in the basement,' she said. Get cooking: This stocked kitchen is any chef's dream . Hardwood: The home's gorgeous hardwood floors run all over the new floorplan . Chef's kitchen: There'll be no need to have nightmares about dinner with this fully-renovated kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances . Long visit: Invite friends to stay in comfort at the property's beautiful one bedroom guest house . The renovation features completely modern furnishings, stainless steel kitchen appliances, and hardwood floors throughout. The backyard is just as plush as the indoors, with a gorgeous garden and pool. Basement chills: Horror fans can take comfort in the fact that from the outside, the home looks almost exactly the same as it did in the films. But the inside is a totally different story .","The house is in Los Angeles - but only the exteriors were used in the film .
It was in complete disrepair when it was purchased in 2008 .
It now looks to be immaculate after the entire home underwent a complete renovation and sold for $2.1 million ."

"A nasty race row has broken out over an Indian family becoming residents into Australia's long-running TV soap Neighbours. The actor who plays an Indian father in Ramsay Street has hit out at fans who say it is 'un-Australian' to cast him, saying they probably supported the 'White Australia' policy. Melbourne-born of Indian descent, Sachin Joab is part of the long-running TV soap's attempt to tackle perceptions the show is too white and doesn't represent modern Australia. Row: Menik Gooneratne, left, Coco-Jacinta Chen and Sachin Joab are the Kapoor family on Neighbours. A race row has now broken out in Australia over their inclusion in the popular show . Yesterday, Neighbours staff Down Under were forced to remove several racist posts from fans angry a non-Anglo-Saxon family would become show regulars, writing 'that racism and small-mindedness won't be tolerated.' Joab blamed racism on a 'lack of education.' 'There is various pockets that will say it is un-Australian to have an Indian or an Indian family on Ramsay St,' he said. Disgraceful: Neighbours staff have been forced to remove several racist posts from fans who are angry a non-Anglo-Saxon family would become show regulars in Ramsay Street, pictured . Favourites: Madge Bishop (Anne Charleston) and Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) were popular among viewers . 'Those Aussies who are saying it is . un-Australian will be the same ones who pretty much supported the White . Australia policy back in the day, you are never going to get away from . that kind of stuff.' Joab said while most Australians were tolerant and respectful, he still faced bouts of racism. 'I . faced racism myself, from the early years in primary school all the way . up to recent times. Sometimes it's just blatant,' he said. 'I think having a show that shows different families coming together can only be good for the community.' Neighbours executive producer Susan Bowers explained that the show wanted to represent a 'more modern society.' Joab will be joined by Menik Gooneratne and Coco-Jacinta Cherian - together they will make up the Kapoor family. 'The . ABC and SBS TV have always cast multi-cultural Australians, and it was . only 20 years ago you put Greeks and Italians on TV and people would . question it,' Ms Bowers said. 'We . have been criticised heavily for being too white and you are damned if . you do and if you don't, and we would much rather be criticised for . moving in this direction.' Ms Bowers said most of the inappropriate comments came from a 'small minority.' But one British fan commented: 'I would also like to point out, this same post was put up on Neighbours UK and so far there has been no racist comments. Think a lot could be learnt from us Brits!'

"Robert Hayes-Danson groomed the girl for three years . A paedophile was caught 20 years after abusing his victim when the woman realised she had been groomed after watching a similar storyline on Eastenders. Robert Hayes-Danson spent three years grooming the victim, now in her thirties, without being brought to justice. But when the woman watched an episode of the soap in which a 12-year-old is sexually exploited by her mother's boyfriend, she realised she had been abused and was not, as she thought, having an 'affair' with the man. Her abuser was found guilty of nine counts of sexual assault and two counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child at Preston Crown Court on Thursday. The court heard how Hayes-Danson took the girl to local shops and bought her perfume which he told her not to tell his wife about. The pair watched videos together while Hayes-Danson offered her lifts in his van and invited her to his home in Preston, Lancashire when she was 12, 14 and 15. The victim put distance between them when, after his first attempt to have sex with her, Hayes-Danson's wife 'almost' interrupted. 'I never thought he groomed me. I just thought I was having an affair with him and betraying his wife,' she said. When the man had a breakdown in 1993, the woman blamed herself. 'I thought it was my fault.' 'All this was going on before and I was petrified. 'I thought I had caused him to have this breakdown. I was so scared someone would find out.' Years later the woman was watching Eastenders when a similar storyline, in which 12-year-old schoolgirl Whitney Dean was exploited by her mother's boyfriend, Tony King, emerged. After contacting police the woman appeared in court to face her abuser who shook his head as verdicts were returned.

Judge Jacqueline Beech told him: 'You have been convicted of some very serious sexual offences.

'You have effectively stolen her childhood and you should be ashamed of yourself. 'You will be sentenced to a sentence of imprisonment. Put your affairs in order for that sentencing hearing.'

"The BBC is refusing to give any regular airtime to the Royal British Legion’s poppy appeal song, in a decision condemned as ‘disgraceful’ by supporters of the military charity. As the nation marks 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War, the charity’s official track has been left off the corporation’s radio playlists. The legion hopes to raise money with the release of the track No Man’s Land performed by Joss Stone. Scroll down for video . The Royal British Legion said the decision to keep their official track No Man's Land off BBC playlists was 'disappointing' News of the BBC snub came as the centenary was marked with Remembrance commemoration services held up and down the country yesterday. The Queen and Royal Family defied fears over security risks to lead the traditional service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall. The BBC said the track was played twice yesterday and also last week, but the Royal British Legion described the decision to keep it off the playlists as ‘disappointing’. A record industry insider said the song, which features guitarist Jeff Beck, was not on Radio 1 or 2 playlists because the stations had already ‘backed’ the Children In Need single. The source told The Mirror last night: ‘It’s disgraceful, a ridiculous decision. Joss Stone and Jeff Beck are spot on for Radio 2 – it should be on the playlist, it’s as simple as that. ‘The record producers were told it couldn’t be put on the playlist because the BBC had already backed Children in Need single, God Only Knows. ‘No Man’s Land has been played a couple of times by Terry Wogan and Vanessa Feltz but they are big supporters of the Legion – I don’t think their producers would have the strength to tell them not to play it. ‘Why it’s not on the official playlist, especially this week, is beyond belief.’ Tribute: Guitarist Jeff Beck and singer Joss Stone, who teamed up to record this year's official Poppy Appeal single, take to the stage at the Royal British Legion's Festival of Remembrance at Royal Albert Hall . Solemn: The BBC confirmed their decision not to include the song on their playlists on the same day as The Queen and the Royal Family led commemorations at the Cenotaph in London . The playlists are decided every week by a panel of 10 radio producers. The song – written in 1976 by Eric Bogle – was performed by Joss Stone in front of the Queen at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday. The single was released on Monday last week and 40 per cent of each sale will go to the charity. The record’s executive producer Liam Maguire said: ‘We respect the BBC’s choice not to support the track but we don’t necessarily agree with it. ‘We hope the great British public comes out and buys the single to push it to No1 and raise money for our brave armed forces community.’ Charles Byrne, director of fundraising at the Royal British Legion, said: ‘It is disappointing the single has not been playlisted by BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2 but we understand there are policies in place.’ The BBC snub is not the only woe to hit the fundraising track. Last week, the song’s writer, now 70, said No Man’s Land (Green Fields Of France)’s anti-war message had been lost with lines taken out for Stone’s version. Those behind the new track left out the lyrics that refer to 'man’s blind indifference to his fellow man. And a whole generation who were butchered and damned' and 'the suffering, the sorrow, the glory, the shame. The killing, the dying, it was all done in vain'. Decisions not to put the songs on the playlists were made by committees run by Radio 1 Head of Music George Ergatoudis (left) and Radio 2 Head of Music Jeff Smith (right) The BBC was hit by an angry backlash on Twitter this morning after the controversial decision emerged . Mr Bogle said: ‘Believe it or not I wrote the song intending for the four verses of the original song to gradually build up to what I hoped would be a climactic and strong anti-war statement. ‘Missing out two and a half verses from the original four verses very much negates that intention.’ A BBC spokesman said last night: ‘The track has been played on Radio 2 including twice on Remembrance Sunday. The BBC has been running an extensive series of programming commemorating the fallen of World War I. ‘It’s preposterous to suggest the song hasn’t been playlisted because of the Children In Need single. ‘New releases are played at a playlist meeting every week and tracks are democratically chosen by a group of at least 10 experienced producers who know their millions of listeners well.’ While No Man's Land does not appear on the list, a number of songs - including tracks by Ed Sheeran, Olly Murs, Paolo Nutini, Coldplay and Pharrell Williams - appear on both Radio 1 and Radio 2's playlists, ensuring they will each be played up to 50 times this week on both stations. Grammy winner: Singer Joss Stone looked elegant as she stepped on to the iconic stage of the Royal Albert Hall (left) to perform the song, which was also played at a recent American football match in London (right) Around 40 songs are included on each station's playlist, with the Radio 1 list put together by a committee run by the station's Head of Music, George Ergatoudis. 'A-list' records get 25 plays a week, 'B-list' get 15 plays and 'C-list' between eight and 10 plays. Other songs are played only at the discretion of DJs. The Radio 1 Playlist Committee, who meet at Broadcasting House, were recently described in an article in the Guardian as 'a group of people in their 20s or 30s, in denim shirts and fluffy pink jumpers'. The paper added: 'They browse Twitter on their iPhones, share snacks, make jokes, and flip through back issues of Closer.' The Radio 2 Playlist Committee is run by Head of Music Jeff Smith, who consults each show's producers to decide which music will be guaranteed to get played. Describing the selection process, Mr Smith recently told Saga Magazine: ‘Whether an artist is 25 or 85, as long as they are making great music that fits our timeless and melodic remit, we should play them. 'We look out for artists who either sound distinctive and new for now or artists who have a place in our easy-listening heritage.’","Charity's official track has been left off corporation's radio playlists .

"A father-of-six has come up with a novel way of raising spirits for mourners at his funeral - by buying himself a coffin built in the shape of a giant Jack Daniels bottle. Former soldier Anto Wickham started planning his own funeral after seeing eight Army pals killed during the Iraq war. The 48-year-old, from Belfast, paid a Nottingham-based firm £3,000 for the ten-foot high replica of a bottle of his favourite tipple. Mr Wickham commissioned the bespoke coffin based on his favourite drink when he decided his funeral needed to be a celebration of his life . Mr Wickham, who spent 22 years with the Royal Irish Regiment, said: 'While working in Iraq after I had a very close call. 'Over a 28-day period in February 2007 I was attacked 74 times and there were some days we would get three or four hits in one day. 'I was attacked by heavy machine gun fire, IEDs and roadside bombs. 'I lost eight colleagues. At the time I thought I would have to plan my funeral because something could go wrong. 'I didn't want a normal funeral and it had to be a celebration of life because I have been to too many funerals of colleagues where they were very sad occasions. 'I wanted something completely different and I decided my favourite drink is Jack Daniels. 'It just happened when I was at home on leave I saw an Alan Titchmarsh programme and I found the company. Former soldier Anto Wickham testing how the coffin fits while its creator, George Spencer, looks on . 'I asked . would it be possible to make it and the answer was yes. My friends see . the funny side of it, but mum and my grandparents are not too . impressed.' Mr . Wickham jetted over from Afghanistan, where he is working as a private . security guard, this week to take a first glimpse at his novelty buy. He said: 'It is absolutely fantastic. When I opened it I could not believe the detail and the artwork. 'They have done a fantastic job. It is just amazing. It was strange getting into it. Mr Wickham said Crazy Coffins had done a 'fantastic job' on the unusual 10ft tall coffin . 'My headstone is going to have a solar-panelled iPad. I plan to leave a video message with pictures of the coffin from start to finish. 'I am also going to approach Guinness to see if they will take me to the service in one of their delivery vans. 'I have even planned my music. I will be coming in to Sid Vicious from the Sex Pistols singing 'My Way' because I am doing everything my way and always have done.' The team that built the coffin spent hours doing the signwriting and creating the right curves of the bottle . His unique coffin is not the only unusual trick Mr Wickham is planning for his funeral. He also plans to ask Guinness if it will take his body to the service in one of its delivery vans and he will play 'My Way' by Sid Vicious . John Gill helped set up Crazy Coffins ten years ago after a string of unusual requests from customers. Mr Gill, a coffin maker of 25 years, said: 'It all started when someone knocked at the door asking for an aeroplane coffin. 'It never crossed our mind that coffin makers did this before that. We have done canal boats and mobile phones and each request seems more bizarre. 'This design was very complicated because there are so many curves in a Jack Daniels bottle and it is almost cut like a diamond. 'We have never had to do so much sign-writing before either. We built it bit by bit because the man was fighting fit and healthy so we knew there was no rush.'","Anto Wickham had a £3000 coffin built in the shape of a Jack Daniels bottle .

"A promising future AFL star has quit the game because of the horrific racial abuse he received on the field. The son of indigenous AFL legend Che Cockatoo-Collins is walking away from the sport despite being a potential top-10 draft pick in the AFL, according to his father. Under-14 player Sachem was allegedly called a 'n*****' by an umpire and told to 'watch his back'. Scroll down for video . Devastated: Che Cockatoo-Collins (left) is angry his son Sachem (right) suffered a racist attack while playing AFL last year and that the umpire who yelled the abuse is now back officiating at games . His father Che, who played 85 games with Essendon and 75 with Port Adelaide from 1994-2003, is now considering making a complaint to the Australian Human Rights Commission and the Anti-Discrimination Commission Queensland. The sickening attack from the official was followed by taunts on social media. 'I was angry, yelling and crying,' Che said of his reaction to his son's attack, which happened last year. 'As parents we still feel guilty we were not there to protect our son,' he told The Sunday Mail. Sachem, who stands at more than 183cm tall and played for Brisbane club side Redland, was named best afield in last year's grand final. He has been described as one of Queensland's 'key attacking weapons'. However, he handed in his jumper after playing out the year. Legend: Che Cockatoo-Collins in action for Port Adelaide in 2003 . Che has spoken out about the incident now because he feels the issue has essentially been washed over. The umpire is back officiating at games after just a two-week ban. Che has asked advice from fellow Essendon player and human rights activist Michael Long and the AFL's Jason Mifsud. 'AFL Queensland took the issue very seriously and an independent investigation resulted in a number of actions against the club and those involved,' former Fitzroy player Michael Conlan, who is now the AFL Queensland chief executive, said. Help: Che has asked advice from fellow Essendon player and human rights activist Michael Long (left), seen here with Essenden coach Mark Thompson . Che has two younger sons, Stirling, 8, and Preston, 10, who he says 'look up to their big brother'. The family live on North Stradbroke Island, Queensland, and all three boys dabble in sports including AFL, rugby league and basketball. Sachem is also said to be 'very good' at basketball. Che has spoken out about the racist attack at the same time that AFL is celebrating its Indigenous Round. The round of games aims to recognise the contribution of Indigenous people and culture to the broader Australian society. Despite attempts to stamp out racism in the game, in 2013, an AFL match between Collingwood and Sydney was marred by a racial taunt from a young supporter at Sydney's Indigenous star Adam Goodes. Swans star and Australian of the Year Adam Goodes has been on the front foot against racism, having been subjected to a number of disgusting attacks over the past 12 months . However, Essendon great Michael Long believes AFL spectators are now getting behind the fight against racism in football. Long, who has been battling racial equality in the game for 10 years, believes the footy-going public is starting to get the message. 'You see the supporters are getting behind it. They're not accepting it, they're not accepting hearing this type of language at the football,' Long told the ABC's AM. 'The fight against it is only just, I think, strengthening.'","Son of indigenous AFL legend Che Cockatoo-Collins is leaving the sport .

Ms Peris posted the picture of the letter to her Facebook page with the caption: 'Today's mail. Only makes me work harder! Thanks to all who have sent their support.' Scroll down for video . Ms Peris posted a picture of a racist letter she received to her Facebook page with the caption 'Today's mail. Only makes me work harder! Thanks to all who have sent their support.' This comes less than two weeks after a Northern Territory News story published a string of her emails, raising accusations she used taxpayer money to facilitate an extra-marital affair with  sprinter Ato Boldon . Ms Peris told Daily Mail Australia she usually receives a racist letter once every few weeks, but said she had been 'inundated' in the past two weeks following a Northern Territory News story that published a string of emails between her and Trinidad and Tobago sprinter Ato Boldon. The story raised accusations she used taxpayer money to facilitate an extra-marital affair with Mr Boldon, but Ms Peris defended herself against the charges during an address to the Federal Senate last month. The senator said the emails were leaked as part of a long-running family dispute and the accusations about her misusing taxpayer funds were 'baseless'. Australia's first female indigenous senator told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that she has been on the receiving end of racism her entire life. 'As a woman, an Aboriginal and a Labor politician I am a beacon for extreme right wing hatred,' Ms Peris said. 'I published the envelope because all Australians need to understand that this sort of racism is alive in this country and to remind a small select group out there that I won't allow them to discourage me or bring me down.' Ms Peris said she opened the letter but 'the contents are far too vulgar and steeped in hatred to bear repeating.' More than 800 people commented on Senator Peris's Facebook post on Monday, with many labelling the sender of the racist letter 'disgusting', 'spineless' and a 'coward'.

"Ebola survivor Ashoka Mukpo has revealed that his deepest fear while battling the deadly virus was dying and leaving behind his fiancée Helen. The 33-year-old told Today, in an interview aired on Thursday, that the 'idea of leaving her was just horrific for me'. He said that Miss Finlay, who had lived with Mukpo in Liberia and had been due to join him when he contracted Ebola last month, was someone he loved 'so deeply' and whose life was 'intertwined with his'. Mr Mukpo, of Providence, Rhode Island, gave his first interview after being given the all-clear on Tuesday.

Mukpo told NBC News that he's massively thankful for everything that helped him survive, but he remains careful not to celebrate too soon. 'For me to kind of know that I got sick, and then was so fortunate to receive the kind of care that I got, when so many people have nothing even approximating slightly that kind of care, it's a heavy feeling.' The 33-year-old, who was deemed a 'tulku' — or reincarnated Tibetan Buddhist lama — as an infant clarified that 'guilt' is not the 'right word.' 'But it — it just feels like something isn't right about that,' Mukpo told NBC. The Rhode Island native also detailed to interviewer Kate Snow the physical pain he endured while fighting off Ebola, which continued even as he prepared to finally head home. 'There's definitely some physical effects of this that I think are gonna last a while. But I can feel my strength coming back every day,' he said. 'There was a period of time that I was quite sick. And, you know, I was laying in a hospital bed and had no strength. 'Had various pains. And — and just all kinds of fun stuff going on in my body.' Thanks to a blood transfusion from Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly and the experimental anti-viral brincidofovir, the fun has just about stopped. Going home at last: Ebola survivor Ashoka Mukpo, an NBC freelance cameraman, poses with his father, Dr. Mitchell Levy and his partner Helen Finlay after being discharged from a special unit at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska on Wednesday . First interview: Muko spoke out on television for the first time Wednesday and detailed his struggle against Ebola and his experience as one of the few Americans who've been treated in the U.S. However, Mukpo won't admit to any regrets. 'It's not something that I will look back on and say, you know, it was the wrong decision to do,' he told NBC. 'But it's also important to keep yourself safe. So, I mean, it's hard to call Ebola a learning experience. But I think that I'm gonna walk away from this with some important lessons for the future.' Ashoka Mukpo's battle against Ebola officially ended Tuesday as the NBC cameraman tested negative for the deadly virus for the third consecutive day. 'Just got my results. 3 consecutive days negative. Ebola free and feeling so blessed,' the 33-year-old tweeted from his Nebraska hospital bed. Mukpo announced his good news along with a tweet of support to infected Dallas nurses Amber Vinson and Nina Pham as Pham's condition was officially upgraded to 'good.' Talented allies: In this image released by Nebraska Medical Center, critical care doctor, Dr. Craig Piquette shakes hands with Mukpo after helping him battle deadly Ebola . Thanking his caregivers: Mukpo is greeted by Biocontainment Unit nursing director Shelly Schwedhelm after being discharged from a special unit at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha . Lots of love: Mukpo is seen here with his father Dr. Mitchell Levy after being discharged. Mukpo, who contracted the virus while working in West Africa, is the second patient to be successfully treated for Ebola, according to the hospital . University of Nebraska Medical Center's Angela Hewlett MD, left,  Phil Smith MD, center, and Shelly Schwedhelm speak to the media regarding Mukpo on Wednesday. Hospital officials had said Tuesday that Mukpo's blood tested negative for the virus . The Nebraska Medical Center said Tuesday afternoon that Ashoka Mukpo's blood tested negative for the virus. He will be allowed to leave a biocontainment unit Wednesday. Mukpo said in a statement that recovering from Ebola 'is a truly humbling feeling.' For the second day in a row, Mukpo heaped on the praise, thanks and answers to questions so many have had since he was admitted to the specially-equipped ward October 6 after contracting Ebola in Liberia. 'I fought and won, with lots of help. Amazing feeling,' he gushed. The knowledge that there's no more virus in my blood is a profound relief. I'm so lucky. Wish everyone who got sick could feel this.' Mukpo made sure to acknowledge his fellow Americans still fighting their battles against Ebola. Scarier times: Here, Mukpo is seen being wheeled into the Nebraska hospital after flying back to the U.S. from Liberia October 6 . Where the struggle began: The freelance journalist from Rhode Island, was working as a cameraman for NBC in Liberia. His jet landed on Monday in Maine for refueling before continuing to Nebraska where he will be treated in a specialized bio-containment unit . 'Still thinking about those nurses. Look forward to the day you two get news like this too...,' he wrote before signing off Tuesday evening. Not long before, the NIH announced that Pham's condition had been updated to good from fair. The 26-year-old's condition had evidently briefly worsened to fair as she arrived at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, late Thursday. Pham is one of two nurses in Dallas who became infected with Ebola while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of the disease October 8. The other nurse, Amber Vinson, is being treated at Emory University in Atlanta. Doing better: Hours before Ashoka's tweets, infected Dallas nurse Nina Pham's condition was upgraded from fair to good . When Ashoka Mukpo was just 8 months old, his father - Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche - announced that the boy was a 'tulku' - the reincarnation of a Tibetan Buddhist Lama. Mr Mukpo later traveled to Tibet, where he was enthroned and honored as the ninth reincarnation of Khamnyon Rinpoche, 'the Mad Yogi of Kham.' A further twist in the cameraman's life: Trungpa, who is considered his father, is not his biological dad. His biological father is actually Mitchell Levy - a Jewish doctor from New York who was Trungpa's personal physician - whom his mother Lady Diana Mukpo was sleeping with at the time. When Ashoka Mukpo was just 8 months old, his father - Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche - announced that the boy was a 'tulku' - the reincarnation of a Tibetan Buddhist Lama . The 33-year-old Mr Mukpo remains a Buddhist. But, despite his wild family history and divine lineage, he has rejected the path of a monk. Instead, he chose a life working for nonprofits and has said his calling is to help alleviate suffering in the world. After his father Trungpa died in 1987, his mother married his biological father, Dr Levy and moved to quiet suburban Providence, Rhode Island. Mr Mukpo's father was a hard-drinking, womanizing Buddhist luminary who founded the first Buddhist monastery in the West and taught the likes of Davie Bowie, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Joni Mitchell in the 1960s and 70s. Chögyam Trungpa was known for his wild, hedonistic Tantric parties that were fueled by drugs, booze and sex. He frequently seduced and slept with his students - claiming that it would help them on their path to enlightenment. Mukpo's girlfriend Helen Finlay had traveled to Nebraska Medical Center, where Ashoka is being treated, along with his parents Dr Mitchell Levy and Lady Diana Mukpo (left) He died at age 48 in 1987 from complications from extreme alcoholism after founding the Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery in Galloway, Scotland, and the Shambhala Mountain Center outside Boulder, Colorado. His mother is Lady Diana Judith Mukpo, born Diana Pybus, the daughter of a wealthy London lawyer. She attended Benenden School, an all-girl's boarding school in Kent, England, where she is thought to have been a contemporary of Princess Anne and Baroness Manningham-Buller, former Director General of MI5. In December 1968, aged 15 and on her Christmas break from Benenden, Diana met 28-year-old Chögyam Mukpo, or Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche as he was known as a lama, at the Buddhist Society in London’s Eccleston Square. In the documentary Tulku, she recalled the first time she laid eyes on the monk, saying: 'I felt like I'd known him for lifetimes. Just immediate, instantaneous lifetime connection. and the rest is history.' She later sneaked out of her boarding school stole into his hotel room that night. She later recalled that she had been hoping that she would end up in bed with him when she introduced herself. Trungpa, who had been having sex since age 13, obliged. Trungpa had traveled to Britain in 1963 on a scholarship to study at Oxford University after fleeing the Chinese occupation of Tibet, and shortly before meeting Diana, he had been teaching David Bowie about Buddhism. In 1970, Diana, just 16 and the Tibetan guru, aged 30, ran away to Scotland to marry. The sensational story of the lawyer's teenage daughter who ran away to marry a monk nearly twice her age became front page news.","The 33-year-old, of Providence, Rhode Island, contracted Ebola while working in Liberia as a freelance cameraman .

"A 23-year-old man is in a serious condition in hospital after being stabbed multiple times in a horrific street attack in which he was chased from his car by a group of up to four men. The motorist was allegedly stabbed in the neck, arm and twice in the leg during the incident which occurred on a slip road off Mancunian Way in Manchester just before 3pm. Police said the suspects, believed to be four men aged between 25 and 35, fled the scene after the incident. They are currently being hunted by officers. Police said a 23-year-old motorist was stabbed multiple times after being chased from his car just before 3pm in Manchester. Officers said four men chased after him before launching the attack off a slip road in the city . Detectives could be see investigating the scene, just off Mancunian Way, this evening after the horrific attack . Greater Manchester Police said an investigation has been launched into the incident after the victim, who was driving a Vauxhall Astra prior to the attack, was seemingly targeted. Officers said they believe the Astra and another car, possibly a hatchback, were travelling along Chorlton Road at speed when the Astra hit the kerb and came to a halt. The driver got out and ran off towards a nearby grassy area but the occupants of the other car pulled over, ran after him and allegedly stabbed him a number of times. The men then fled the scene in their vehicle and are now being sought by police. The victim was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary with multiple stab wounds. He was described this evening as being conscious and in a stable condition. Detective Inspector Aidy Gallagher, based at North Manchester, said: 'A man is in hospital with stab wounds, but at this stage we believe they are not too serious. 'From what we know so far it appears the Astra and another car were driving at speed along Chorlton Road when the Astra hit the kerb and stopped. 'He ran off but was pursued by the people in the other car and then stabbed. A Vauxhall Astra, believed to belong to the victim, could be seen parked at the scene today. It is thought the driver ran from his vehicle before being chased onto a verge by four suspects and stabbed in broad daylight . Greater Manchester Police said the four suspects, aged between 25 and 35, fled the scene (pictured) in a vehicle after the incident. The victim was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary and is now in a stable condition . Officers were carrying out their investigations with torches this evening as darkness fell in Manchester .

'We are now appealing for witnesses so, if anyone saw these cars speeding down Chorlton Road, or the stabbing incident itself, then please call police.' Police said one of the suspects was black, while the other three were described as Asian. North West Ambulance Service said paramedics arrived at the scene just after 3pm, and Greater Manchester Police confirmed the force's helicopter was also scrambled alongside several officers. Following the incident, which occurred at the junction of Chester Road and Chorlton Road, at the roundabout at the bottom of Mancunian Way, police cordoned off surrounding roads. Police said Chorlton Road, at the junction with Mancunian Way, is expected to remain closed for some time while the scene is examined. Detectives could be seen carrying out investigations at the scene as darkness fell in Manchester this evening. A recovery truck was also brought in to tow away a vehicle, believed to be the Astra belonging to the victim.

"Dancers at the Royal Opera House are being paid less than box office assistants, the union which represents performers has revealed. Professional freelance dancers in one production were paid just £9.14 an hour for entertaining thousands of audience members each week, according to Equity. Meanwhile, the income of those selling tickets to customers was £10.70 per hour over the same period. Professional freelance dancers in one production were paid just £9.14 an hour for entertaining thousands of audience members each week at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden (pictured) The Equity Freelance Dance Network, a branch of the union, has now called for a meeting with bosses at the Covent Garden venue in London to address the ‘huge disparity’, The Daily Telegraph reported last night. In an open letter to the Royal Opera House, the union said that dancers felt that there was ‘a huge disparity and a lack of value when compared to the other work that freelancers carry out’. The letter goes on to ask: ‘Why are we not paid above or at least equal to that amount when working for one of the largest, most heavily subsidised arts organisations in the country? The Equity Freelance Dance Network has now called for a meeting with bosses at the Covent Garden venue in London to address the ‘huge disparity’. Pictured is a performance of the Barber of Seville . ‘Particularly when compared to the wages of other artists working on any given opera.’ In one production of Krol Roger, a Polish opera due to be staged at the venue, the rate advertised for dancers is lower than the wage given to box office staff. The union described the pay as ‘disheartening’ and said that it made performers feel ‘poorly’ valued. The letter added: ‘What is often overlooked is the amount of time, effort and financial investment it requires for a freelance dancer to continue training in between jobs in order to be at a professional level when they start a job with someone like ROH. ‘The strong work ethic of dancers is well known within the industry, and we would hope that an organisation like ROH would be able to recognise this.’ The Royal Opera House said it was ‘in discussion’ with the union about the issue and that a meeting had been planned. The spokesman added: ‘We hope to reach a mutually agreeable solution as soon as possible.’","Professional freelance dancers in one production were paid £9.14 an hour .

'GM should have notified its customers immediately to take . all weight off of their key chains. 'By the time GM actually . ordered these parts, it had to have already spent months making . the decision to place the order,' Hilliard said in a statement.

A fault with the car's ignition switch turned off vital systems such as the power steering and airbags moments before the crash. The girls' family accepted the offer after they dropped a lawsuit against the Detroit car giant which could have hidden behind bankruptcy protection in the event of a court case. Margie Beskau, mother of Miss Rademaker, told CNBC at the time: 'No amount of money can bring my daughter back.

"People living on the streets have been going without meals as greedy backpackers take advantage of homeless food services. Some charities, including the Salvation Army, have been forced to stop visiting some homeless hotspots throughout Melbourne with their food vans because of a surge in stingy tourists lining up for a free meal. Major Brendan Nottle from the Salvation Army said they offered food to anyone who showed up and had actually run out of food a few times due to the number of backpackers. People living on the streets have been going without meals as greedy backpackers take advantage of homeless food services . 'They were often wearing the latest hiking boots and it left the homeless people feeling intimidated,' Mr Nottle told Daily Mail Australia. 'We tried to talk to the backpackers but sometimes there was a language barrier. Other times they understood but used to show up anyway. 'I think they just thought it was free food, but it was pretty obvious that the people there were struggling (financially). 'We never refuse food because you never fully know the circumstances, but we had to stop going to specific spots because of the backpackers... homeless people started dropping off from the outreach van because they didn't feel comfortable.' The Salvation Army decided to stop visiting certain places with the food van and instead keep its Bourke Street welfare hub open later to encourage the homeless community to come inside for a meal. Salvation Army have stopped taking its food van to Melbourne hotspots because too many tourists were lining up for free food . They started the Bella’s Friendship Club at the Bourke Street premises to help isolated people interact with others. 'It's given us an opportunity to rework what we do here in Melbourne. From 6-8pm on Monday to Friday homeless people gather together (at the welfare hub) in a dignified way,' Mr Nottle said. 'We get about 70-80 people each night and they now get to sit down and have a proper meal with proper cutlery. 'Then we take the van out later than we used to and visit isolated areas identied by police or council as having rough sleepers.' Mr Nottle said the number of backpackers coming to food vans in Melbourne had increased in the past few years and suspects they used social media to alert people about how to get free meals. The number of backpackers caused the charity to run out of food on several occasions .","Salvation Army have stopped taking its food van to Melbourne hotspots because too many tourists were lining up for free food .

Detectives are continuing to question a 47 year-old man who was arrested in Southsea, Hampshire, more than 100 miles away from the murder scene. The body of Mr Plater, who lived alone, was found outside his detached home in Walkley Hill in Stroud on Friday. A white forensic tent has put up on the driveway of the pensioner's home in Stroud, Gloucestershire, today .

The male teacher, who has not not been named, was removed from Southington High School in Connecticut last Thursday morning. Parents were notified in a letter from the school where the teacher's actions were described as 'inappropriate behavior'. The male teacher, who has not not been named, was barred from teaching at Southington High School in Connecticut . School authorities did not go into details of the incident but called it a 'personal issue' which was being dealt with by staff. According to teens at the school, several students videotaped the incident where the teacher also allegedly pinned a student against the wall. Students told local news stations that the behavior was out of the ordinary for a well-like teacher but that gossip about the incident has spread like wild fire through the school. Senior Justin Flanagan told WTNH: 'I heard that a teacher, a Spanish teacher, came in drunk to school, and I guess he got in an altercation with a student.' The teacher was not arrested nor was the incident reported to police. The school refused to give further details on the teacher's future at the school but said that they are investigating. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the principal of Southington High School.","The male teacher, who has not not been named, was barred from teaching at Southington High School in Connecticut .

"A Maine nurse who battled politicians over her quarantine after she returned from treating Ebola patients in West Africa said she will continue speaking out on behalf of public health workers. Monday marks the 21st day since Kaci Hickox's last exposure to an Ebola patient, a ten-year-old girl who suffered seizures before dying alone without family. On Tuesday, Hickox will no longer require daily monitoring for Ebola symptoms, and said she looks forward to stepping out her front door 'like normal people.' Free to go: On Tuesday, Kaci Hickox will no longer require daily monitoring for Ebola symptoms, and said she looks forward to stepping out her front door 'like normal people' But the Texas native said she won't back away from the debate over treatment of health care workers. 'In the past, a quarantine was something that was considered very extreme. I'm concerned about how lightly we're taking this concept today,' said Hickox, who defied state-ordered quarantine attempts in New Jersey and Maine. 'I'm concerned that the wrong people are leading the debate and making the decisions.' She said the U.S. needs a public education campaign to better explain the virus that has killed nearly 5,000 in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. However, Hickox said she wouldn't let her experience prevent her from returning to West Africa. Getting life back on track: Hickox said she plans to have dinner with her boyfriend Ted Wilbur to mark the end of the deadly disease's incubation period, but she's not sure what kind of reception she'll get . 'Something like quarantine is not going to scare me from doing the work that I love,' she told The Associated Press from her home in Fort Kent in northern Maine. 'I would return to Sierra Leone in a heartbeat.' Hickox said she plans to have dinner with her boyfriend to mark the end of the deadly disease's incubation period, but she's not sure what kind of reception she'll get. She has been hailed by some and vilified by others for refusing to be quarantined. Most people have been supportive, she said, but others have been hateful. She received a letter from one person who said he hoped she would catch Ebola and die. 'We're still thankful we've had a lot of great support in this community but I'd be lying if I said that it didn't make me a little bit nervous thinking about people from the other side of the debate and how they might react to me,' Hickox said. Leaving: Hickox and Wilbur have announced that they will stay in  Maine while they sort out what's next . A volunteer with Doctors Without Borders, she spent a month at a hospital where there were never enough beds for all of the Ebola patients who needed help. It was so hot that volunteers could only spend about an hour at a time treating patients in their protective suits. They were drenched in sweat when they finished their shifts, she said. On the morning she left Sierra Leone, the weary nurse learned that the girl she'd treated hours earlier had died. She was debriefed by Doctors Without Borders in Brussels before flying to the U.S. It was after three hours of questioning at the Newark Liberty International Airport that she resolved that she'd have to make a stand on behalf of all returning health care workers. 'I said I'm going to have to do something about this because I can't possibly let my colleagues go through this. This is completely unacceptable,' she said. Hickox was sequestered in a medical tent for days because New Jersey announced new Ebola regulations the day she arrived. She eventually was allowed to travel to Maine, where the state sought to impose a 'voluntary quarantine' before trying and failing to create a buffer between her and others. A state judge rejected attempts to restrict her movements, saying she posed no threat as long as she wasn't demonstrating any symptoms of Ebola. Hickox said health care professionals like those at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - not politicians like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Maine Gov. Paul LePage - should be in charge of making decisions that are grounded in science, not fear. Hickox said she's considering her options as she looks for work. Her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur, contends he was told to stay away from the University of Maine at Fort Kent while she was in the news. He formally withdrew from the school Friday. The couple said they'd be leaving town soon. They plan to stay in southern Maine while they sort out what's next, Hickox told the AP. Hickox, who holds a nursing degree from the University of Texas at Arlington and master's degrees in nursing and public health from Johns Hopkins University, said she may opt to go back to school. 'I have been over the last couple of days been toying with the idea of maybe getting a doctorate degree and focusing on quarantine law,' she said.","Kaci Hickox to leave Maine home after 21-day incubation period ends .

"This is the shocking moment a rowdy passenger sparked a massive fight on a New York City subway train. The young woman had been taunting another passenger on the Washington Square station-bound F train, when she was slapped so hard she was almost knocked over. Another man jumped to her defence as scenes descended into chaos with the men raining punches down on each other. Scroll down for video . A woman, who was taunting a passenger on a New York subway train, was slapped so hard she almost fell . A friend jumped to her defence and ended up fighting with the man who slapped her as it was caught on film . The New York City Police Department said it is investigating the incident, which was captured on camera and has since gone viral, according to New York Daily News. The undated footage, which was uploaded to YouTube on Saturday, has already had more than 600,000 views. It shows the woman on the train with her friends telling the man, who is wearing a leather 8 ball jacket and fur hat, to stay away before she starts to insult his clothing. Her friends egg her on and clap as she throws insults at the unnamed man, who nods and smiles at her. She tells the tall man: 'You got a dumb*** 8 ball jacket that came out in the 1990s.' The woman, who is holding a pair of high-heeled snake skin boots, then says: ‘I’m done. You wanna know what shoes I’ve got on? They’re Steve Madden ones, alright?’ before sitting down. She was insulting his dress sense and told him 'You got a dumb*** 8 ball jacket that came out in the 1990s' The young woman's friends jump up when they see that another passenger is recording the argument . Her attention is then drawn to the man filming the incident after he tells her: ‘Nobody wears Steve Madden no more,’ and her friends jump up and charge towards him asking him what he is doing. He backs off but the woman knocks the phone from his hand – sending it flying to the ground but it is still recording and he tells her ‘you’re petty as hell – you can’t even afford this.’ The man picks it up but she knocks it from his hands again before continuing her attack on the man in the fur jacket. 'You sound stupid,' she shouts at him from behind before hitting him on the back of his head with her boot. The girl continues to taunt the man by telling him he sounds stupid before she hits him on the back of his head . A man steps in in an attempt to break up the fight but is unsuccessful and also ends up in the middle of the fight . He then swiftly turns round and slaps her hard across the cheek, creating a loud smacking noise. The girl's friend jumps in and the situation quickly spirals out of control with several people trying to hit each other, while the cameraman screams in excitement. Another man steps in to break up the fight and eventually two of the men are separated. The video, titled 'Man smacks the soul out of girl on the NY Subway', has since gone viral and even led to remixed versions online.","Young woman was taunting man on Washington Square-station bound train .

"Former federal MPs have threatened the government with High Court action should they lose their free airfare travel pass. The retired MPs have submitted a report to the Senate blasting the government's 'unconstitutional' plans to abolish the 'life gold pass' travel card. The government announced in May that it would eradicate the travel perk, which allows retired MPs and their spouses to take up to ten, free, return business-class airfares within Australia every year. However in a new report, former Liberal MP Murray Sainsbury, who is also President of the Association of Former Members of the Parliament of Australia, said that the proposal was 'unacceptable', 'disappointing' and 'should not be arbitrated by public opinion.' Scroll down for video . Former federal MPs have threatened the government with High Court action should they continue with their 'unconstitutional' plans to abolish the 'life gold pass' travel card . Mr Sainsbury also claims that the 'very modest' savings of $1 million for the next five years would be 'minuscule' in the context of the government's Budget expenditure. He said current pass holders will eventually stop travelling because of age or death and given the closure of the pass to parliamentarians elected after 2012, the abolition of the benefit is not justified. Members of Parliament need to serve seven terms, or 20 years in Parliament, to qualify for a travel pass. Retired MPs have submitted a report to the Senate blasting the government's 'unconstitutional' plans to abolish the 'life gold pass' travel card. MPs and senators elected since 2012 are not eligible for the pass. Mr Sainsbury argues in the report that the only justification given for the obliteration of the pass was that retired MPs must be forced 'to make a contribution to the budget repair task'. He states that the travel pass was given to parliamentarians as part of their remuneration package and backtracking on the government's part was 'irresponsible'. Mr Sainsbury says according to public opinion, 'whatever remuneration parliamentarians receive is too much, regardless of how low it may be'. The current pass allows retired MPs and their spouses to take up to ten free return airfares within Australia every year . He also claims that 'parliamentarians' entitlements should not be the subject of political whim or expediency.' The gold pass  extends to spouses accompanying MPs on official trips. Mr Sainsbury alleges that most spouses during his era gave up their chances at a career, claiming therefore that 'the electorate was served by two for the price of one.' 'This appropriately recognises that during the era that most Life Gold Pass holders served in the Parliament their spouses, rather than pursuing their own careers, voluntarily and without remuneration supported the parliamentarian in their day-to-day electorate work, including attending functions in the electorate,' Ms Sainsbury said. Mr Sainsbury said the scheme - which was held for MPs elected to parliament before 2012 - was served to parliamentarians 'in lieu of inadequate salaries' and justifications for its removal were 'fanciful.' He also stated that the government 'are on very shaky ground regarding the constitutional validity of the legislation' and obliterating it would be 'unconstitutional' because it amounts to 'unjust' acquisition of property. The report, which has been submitted to a Senate enquiry,has now been removed from the Parliament's website following an article which appeared on The West Australian.","Former MPs are outraged at the government's proposal to do away with their free airfare travel .

"Busy shop tills will be the sound ringing in the New Year as a financial report released Tuesday has predicted that small businesses in Australia can expect bumper profits over Christmas. The Commonwealth Bank’s biannual SME (small and medium enterprises) Confidence Report has revealed that these businesses have every reason to feel optimistic over the coming weeks. Some 87 per cent of SMEs think business conditions will improve or stay the same over next six months, with 76 per cent expecting customer demand to be higher or the same as last year, and 43 per cent expecting revenue and profit to be up on last year. The report measures confidence among Australian businesses with an annual turnover of $500,000 to $10 million and examines the main challenges and opportunities surrounding these businesses in the current economic environment. Pamper Hamper’s owner and operator Bianca Kristallis is looking forward to a bumper Christmas . When asked about business conditions in general over the next six months, the majority of business owners said they were feeling positive. Pamper Hamper Gifts is a luxury online gift hamper company celebrating its 10th anniversary as an online business this year . Owner and operator Bianca Kristallis believed that preparation was everything. 'Businesses can gauge early on from the enquiries and pre-orders made if they are going to have a busy Christmas or not,' Kristallis said. Bianca Kristallis believes that being prepared is what matters most for businesses at Christmas . 'Australian businesses have woken up to the need to be on the ball early at Christmas time. Christmas started for us in early October. It’s the money-making season. 'If businesses are not ready for the Christmas market by September or October then they’ll miss the boat. Online businesses are increasing every year and you just need to be ready and have your systems in place.' Commonwealth Bank’s biannual SME (small and medium enterprises) Confidence Report has been released Tuesday . Dependability is also a major factor with customers as it means they can rely on the business in question to maintain a high standard of customer service. 'We do a lot of research and development, and we've found that customers want to be able to trust us. They want to leave their gifts in our hands and trust us to deliver them without any problems,' Kristallis explained. Pamper Hamper Gifts is a luxury online gift hamper company that is celebrating its 10th anniversary . 'This year our Christmas market is booming. The positive thing about our style of business is that we choose to go online rather than go bricks and mortar, so we don’t have that bricks and mortar pressure.'Because we’re in a digital space we get a lot of comeback customers from last year. However, the report also found that almost half (47%) of the businesses said that economic conditions in Australia are a concern, with 39 per cent saying global economic conditions were having a negative impact on their overall business confidence. While 52 per cent of businesses have no insight into their customer's likely spending patterns. Despite this Adam Bennett, Executive General Manager Local Business Banking for Commonwealth Bank, believed the findings indicated that SMEs have high expectations for this Christmas trading period and are generally feeling confident as we head towards 2015. However the important message for SMEs is to be prepared. Adam Bennett of Commonwealth Bank advises businesses to plan carefully for Christmas . 'Given the significance of the Christmas trading period, it’s important that businesses ensure they are well prepared to capitalise on increased customer demand. 'With six weeks until Christmas, there is time to put the right plans and resources in place to meet their customer needs and make the most of a bumper Christmas,' said Bennett.

"The NYPD is set to stop arresting people who are caught with small amounts of marijuana in their possession and will issue tickets instead. The move would see those who have previously been handcuffed and taken to a police station being given court summons instead. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton announced that the official change to the city's marijuana policy will  take effect November 19. Changes: Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, pictured holding up a bag or marijuana alongside Mayor Bill de Blasio, announced that minor marijuana possession will no longer lead to arrest but court summons instead . He said at a press conference on Monday: 'Make no mistake, marijuana is still illegal in New York City. People smoking marijuana in public will continue to be arrested. 'But possession of small amounts, with certain exceptions, is not considered a high enough level of offense to merit the time and resources the Department spends when arresting people, or the potential associated consequences of criminal justice involvement for the arrestees. Mayor Bill De Blasio added: 'This new policy will reduce unnecessary arrests for minor marijuana possession and put an end to an era where many of young New Yorkers were being arrested and saddled with criminal records for minor violations. 'Today's action is the latest in a series of steps Commissioner Bratton and I have taken to rebuild the relationship between the NYPD and the communities they serve. 'We are also enhancing public safety with this new initiative by directing police resources towards more serious crime, and not wasting officer time processing unnecessary arrests.' In the first 10 months of 2014, the NYPD has received approximately 23,000 911 or 311 calls from New Yorkers complaining about the sale or public smoking of marijuana in their neighborhoods. This is almost a 30 per cent increase over last year. New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton points to a chart on marijuana arrests during a news conference. The city has seen a 30 per cent increase in people complaining about sales of marijuana in their neighborhoods . The new summons policy reflects the distinction New Yorkers make between the more significant crimes of smoking and dealing, and possession of small amounts of marijuana . According to the New York Times, suspects caught carrying under 25 grams of the drug on their person 'may be eligible', however people caught burning or smoking it will still be arrested. It would be a significant step towards to addressing the department's controversial stop-and-frisk policy. In May it was reported that minor marijuana arrests in New York City have plunged in recent years amid questions about police tactics. However statistics showed the arrests dropped more modestly in the first three months of De Blasio's adminisration, even after pledges to reduce them. New guidelines: The Mayor's office tweeted as the announcement was being made . Arrests for the lowest-level marijuana crime fell 34 percent in the first quarter of 2013 — and 9 percent in the first quarter of this year, to roughly 7,000, according to state Division of Criminal Justice Services data. Since 1977, New York state has considered possession of less than 25 grams (about 7/8 of an ounce) a non-criminal violation akin to a traffic ticket — unless the drug is 'open to public view.' In those cases, it's a misdemeanor, spurring an arrest record and potentially three months in jail, though many cases get dismissed if defendants avoid rearrest. The arrests averaged about 2,100 a year from 1978 through 1995, but more than 36,700 per year from 1996 through 2011. Federal data show marijuana use nationwide has risen, but far less dramatically, during the last decade. After the arrests — and outcry — hit a high in 2011, the arrests plummeted from about 50,700 then to 28,600 last year.","People caught carrying under 25 grams of the drug will be given summons .

"Bones that could belong to King Alfred the Great have been exhumed from a churchyard over fears that they might be stolen or vandalised . It couldbe the year for discovering notorious monarchs. Just weeks after remains found under a car park were confirmed as Richard III, archaeologists now believe they may just have stumbled on Alfred the Great. Amid great secrecy, a team exhumed an unmarked grave at a more fitting location for a Royal burial - a churchyard in Winchester named in ancient documents as his burial place. After a delicate 10-hour operation on Monday, human skeletal remains were unearthed in the churchyard of St Bartholomew’s in the Hyde area of the city, and taken for storage at an undisclosed location. Unearthing Alfred the Great, the Anglo-Saxon king who fought off the Vikings and established the foundations of our law codes and justice system, would be one of the most significant finds ever. Historians agree that the king, who died in the year 899 after a distinguished 28-year reign, had a great impact on Britain today, safeguarding the English language and Christian religion. But archaelogists admit discovering him would be a very long shot, as unlike Richard III who remained under the same car park for five hundred years, Alfred’s bones were moved at least twice. Earlier this year, Katie Tucker, an archaeologist from the University of Winchester leading the search admitted it would be difficult to prove any remains are his - but hoped her team could prove the age of the bones. She said: ‘If the bones are from around the 10th century then that is proof they are Alfred and his family, because Hyde Abbey was not built until the 12th Century, and there is no reason for any other bones from the 10th Century to be there.’ No-one from the university would comment on the latest developments last night, as the exhumation was carried out behind metal screens on Monday and yesterday in total secrecy for security reasons - although filmed by a TV company. It is not known how Alfred the Great died, but he was buried in the Old Minster, the Anglo-Saxon cathedral in Winchester. Archaeologists carried out the exhumation of an unmarked grave at St Bartholomew's Church in Winchester, Hampshire (pictured), this morning on church orders . Alfred lived from 849 AD to 899 and was born in Wantage, Oxfordshire. He is the only English monarch to be afforded the title The Great . Alfred is the only English monarch to be known as 'the Great' and was the first to consider himself King of the Anglo-Saxons. Although he is often portrayed as a great warrior in statues around Winchester and Wantage, he was not physically strong and is believed to have suffered poro health for most of his life. One of the legends surrounding the king was that, while fleeing from Danish aggressors, he hid in the home of a woman who did not recognise him. She asked him to look over her cakes that were baking in the oven but, troubled by his kingdom's problems, he absent-mindedly allowed them to burn. Alfred was born in 849 and died on October 26, 899. He had been King of Wessex from 871 until his death. It is not known how he died. He was originally buried temporarily in the Old Minster in Winchester, then moved to the New Minster. In 1110 Alfred's body was transferred to Hyde Abbey. Soon after the dissolution of the abbey in 1539, during the reign of Henry VIII, the church was demolished, but the graves were left intact. The royal graves and many others were rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed on the site. No confirmed remains of Alfred have subsequently been found. When Alfred’s son King Edward the Elder built an impressive New Minster two years later - possibly to house his father’s body - the remains were moved there. Then, in the year 1110, old chronicles reveal the monks at New Minster moved to new location nearby and took the bones with them again, to Hyde Abbey, a little north of the city, along with the remains of King Alfred the Great’s wife and children. This Abbey was demolished when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries in 1539 although most of the graves were left intact. The site was looted by convicts in the 1700s and there seem to have been some attempts to dig for Alfred there in the nineteeth century with no success. Permission to dig at the churchyard was granted by the Diocese of Winchester for security reasons following recent publicity about King Alfred - to prevent people attempting to dig him up. A spokesperson for the Diocese confirmed human remains were exhumed, and that the rector of St Bartholomew’s and the Bishop of Basingstoke performed prayers at the graveside beforehand. No application has yet been made to carry out scientific testing on them, but the diocese expect this will be received very soon. Dr Helen Foxhall Forbes, a lecturer in early medieval history at Exeter University who is not involved in the dig, told the Mail last night: ‘Even if they do radio-carbon dating on the bones which reveals they are from the tenth century, we do not know if it is Alfred. ‘The monks may not have moved the correct bones or made sure they weren’t contamined with any other remains. ‘With Richard III, not only did he have distinguishing features, his scoliosis, to identify him, but they were able to find a surviving descendant after 500 years to do DNA testing. With a king who died more than a thousand years ago that would be very, very difficult. ‘The DNA testing on Richard III was done by experts wearing forensic suits, as even breathing on the remains can contaminate it, so I would be concerned about the amount of tampering with the bones over the centuries. As a historian I would love it if they found him but it would be an extremely long shot, I would be very dubious if they said they had found Alfred the Great.’","Removed from St Bartholomew's Church in Winchester, on church orders .

"Cured: Dr Craig Spencer is said to be leaving New York's Bellevue Hospital Center tonight, 19 days after he was admitted for Ebola treatment . New York Ebola patient Dr Craig Spencer is heading home to see his girlfriend today after being cleared, but will not be able to have sex for three months because the virus can survive in semen. Dr Spencer, 33, was isolated in Bellevue Hospital after reporting Ebola symptoms following his return from helping to treat the deadly infection in Guinea. His case caused alarm after it emerged he had travelled around the city for six days, going bowling, dining out and using an Uber cab, before being diagnosed. Following round the clock treatment for 19 days, sources tell the New York Times Dr Spencer has been given the all-clear to go home to his fiancee Morgan Dixon, who is quarantined in their Harlem apartment. Miss Dixon will have to remain in the house for the next four days, as she is still considered an infection risk. Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician from Lenox Hill Hospital, told the New York Daily News: 'Once he's had Ebola, he develops antibodies (that are) protective to him. 'He won't get Ebola again. Since he's not having fever or active symptoms, he's not at risk to the community. 'The virus lives in semen for up to 3 months, so he should not engage in sexual intercourse (for that time).' Mayor Bill de Blasio said he will shake Dr Spencer's hand after he is released, calling him a hero, and adding that his is the last known case of Ebola in the U.S. Seven of the eight cases of Ebola cured on American soil have all been treated within 22 days - and the eighth patient was released within 40 days. Quarantined: Dr Spencer contracted the disease after treating patients in Guinea (left). His fiancee Morgan Dixon (right with Spencer) has been quarantined in their Harlem apartment until November 14 . Fears: Dr Spencer's diagnosis sparked widespread fear as is emerged he had taken the subway, an Uber cab, gone bowling and dined out twice. His apartment in Harlem (pictured) was cordoned off for an afternoon . Dr Spencer's condition was upgraded from serious to stable after he received a blood transfusion from fellow US Ebola survivor Nancy Writebol, a missionary who contracted the disease in Liberia. The method was also used to treat Dallas nurses Amber Vinson and Nina Pham, NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, Dr Nancy Writebol and Dr Rick Sacra. Holed up in Bellevue, in New York City's Murray Hill area, Dr Spencer has been playing the banjo and practicing yoga, it emerged last week. On Wednesday, the doctor requested that someone bring him his banjo from his apartment so he could pass the time in quarantine playing music. Spencer was also reportedly keeping in shape by riding a stationary bicycle in his hospital room. Another source told the New York Post he has been playing David Bowie and Interpol songs all day long, which has earned him the reputation as a 'total hipster' among hospital staff, some of whom were not impressed by his taste in music. Also cured: Dallas nurses Amber Vinson (left with George Bush) and Nina Pham (right) were cured last month . ‘He is an avid little banjo player and he’s self-taught,’ Chriselle Gardner, the mother of Spencer’s fiancee Morgan Dixon, told the Post. ‘I can tell you, he’s keeping his doctors amused.’ Dixon has been in quarantine at their apartment since October 25. She will be able to leave their home for the first time since Craig’s diagnosis on November 14. New York City health officials also announced Wednesday that a person who had been in contact with Dr Spencer is being released from mandatory quarantine, but will be subject to daily evaluations by a doctor, reported CBS New York. The HHC emphasized that the person in question does not show any Ebola symptoms and does not pose any health risk to the general public. City officials revealed Wednesday that a total of 357 people were being actively monitored for signs of Ebola as a precaution, among them travelers from West Africa and Bellevue staff caring for Dr Spencer. Dr Kent Brantly: Contracted Ebola in Liberia, arrived in the US August 2, released August 23 . Dr Nancy Writebol: Also infected in Liberia, arrived in the US August 5, released August 21 .

"The Discovery Channel has been urged not to show footage of a man being eaten alive by a snake because it is 'animal cruelty'. New Jersey native Paul Rosolie fed himself to a 30ft green anaconda in the Amazon rainforest for a program that is due to air on December. But more than 21,000 people have signed a petition saying the stunt should not be televised because of the perceived risks to the animal, and claims that it 'reinforces the negative stereotype of snakes'. Scroll down for video . Opposition: More than 21,000 people have signed a petition saying the stunt by Paul Rosolie should not be aired because of the perceived risks to the animal, and claims that it 'reinforces the negative stereotype of snakes' The petition, started by Ben Paramonte, reads: 'This is animal abuse to the highest degree and absolutely disgusting, and could kill the snake - an adult green anaconda cannot fit the width of an adult man's shoulders into it's body. 'It once again reinforces the negative stereotype of snakes, which one would think would be the opposite of what Discovery should be trying to do. 'Please sign this petition and boycott the Discovery Channel and get this show taken off the air. 'I've been fascinated by snakes my entire life, and feel this stunt is void of educational value while ruining Discovery Channel's credibility. The show promotions even show the host holding an anaconda by the head as if he's about to be attacked. 'That's perpetuating stereotypes that condition people to fear these animals.

'No matter how it ends, this is animal cruelty from start to finish so I hope you will support me.' Paramonte added that producers of the show asked him to be part of the stunt as a scientific advisor. He turned down the offer, saying he was 'shocked and saddened' someone would want to film such an act. During the stunt the 26-year-old American took the precaution of donning a special snake-proof suit he devised to protect against the creature’s digestive juices. It is believed he was covered in pig’s blood to make himself appetising to anacondas, which usually eat wild pigs, deer, capybaras and caiman, and was pulled out by a cord attached to the suit. Insiders said the snake did not die and Rosolie has since tweeted in response to animal lovers who have accused him of cruelty and demanded the show be axed. ‘I would never hurt a living thing,’ he said. ‘But you’ll have to watch to find out how it goes down!’ Precautions: During the stunt the 26-year-old American donned a special snake-proof suit he devised to protect against the creature’s digestive juices .","Paul Rosolie fed himself to a 30ft green anaconda in the Amazon jungle .

"In the gun-friendly state of Texas, more pensioners are finding themselves in trouble with the law because they’re packing heat in their hand luggage. This year, there has been an increase in the number of senior citizens being arrested with firearms at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. In July and August alone, police arrested 11 people who tried to get through security with firearms in their hand luggage, and almost half were in their 60s and 70s, according to ABC affiliate WFAA. Five pensioners were caught with firearms at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in July and August . All five of the pensioners told police they forgot they had a firearm in their bag before it was submitted for screening. Charges were eventually dropped in all cases. The uptick in arrests could be linked to an increase in the number of older Texans carrying guns, WFAA reported. Last year, the state granted concealed handgun permits to 67,000 seniors ranging from 60 to 100 years old. That includes 122 seniors who are in their 90s, an increase from 19 in 2010. All of the pensioners who were arrested told police they forgot they had a firearm in their hand luggage . David Prince, owner of Eagle Gun Range just north of Dallas, said he expects the trend of arrests to continue as more pensioners legally arm themselves. He told WFAA that more seniors have been coming to his range to learn how to fire a gun to protect themselves. The 65-year-old said: ‘You know how hectic the airport is. I think people are just forgetting. Let's face it, people of my age get a little more forgetful every day.’","Eleven people were arrested with firearms in July and August .

"A top Red Cross official has said it will take up to six months to get the Ebola outbreak under control as the hunt continues for a vaccine to the deadly disease. Even that time frame will only be realistic if medics in West Africa ensure 'safe burials', 'good isolation' and 'good treatment', according to Red Cross secretary general Elhadj As Sy. He warned a press conference many nations' workers are 'coming out and running away, and others [are] very hesitant to send people'. Scroll down for video . Warning: It will take up to six months to get Ebola under control, but even that time frame will only be realistic if medics ensure 'safe burials', 'good isolation' and 'good treatment', according to a top Red Cross official . Hopes: The first shipment of the experimental vaccine VSE-EBOV, which arrived at a Geneva hospital today . Mr Sy was speaking in the Chinese capital Beijing at the Red Cross's Asia-Pacific conference, held every four years. He told delegates the epidemic - whose death toll rose today to at least 4,877 people in West Africa since it emerged ten months ago - could be contained within four to six months. There have now been 9,936 probable, suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with transmission in some areas remaining 'intense'. World Health Organisation (WHO) figures suggest the real death toll is as high as 15,000. Mr Sy also praised China for contributing relief items, laboratory equipment and protective gear to help in the fight against the deadly virus. Vials: The WHO welcomed the donation by the government of Canada of 800 doses of the test vaccine today . Meanwhile in West Africa: Oxfam worker Holly Taylor with community health worker Mary Kamara in Freetown . Two Ebola survivors with their medical certificates . Almost 50 Ebola survivors were discharged today from a treatment centre in Sierra Leone - proudly holding up certificates to show they were free of the disease. One survivor, 14-year-old Hawanatu Turay, 14, said: 'Nothing hurts me anymore and I am feeling fine, I can do anything I want to do . 'I am happy, I can eat fine, my stomach hurts no more, my head aches no more and also my neck, nothing hurts and I have no more pains.' The 45 patients brought the total number of survivors released by the facility near the capital Freetown to 130. But there were fierce clashes elsewhere in the West African country, which has had 1,259 Ebola deaths. A curfew was imposed today in the eastern diamond-rich Kono district after protests which saw police fire tear gas to disperse crowds who had gathered with sticks and machetes. They were supporting an opposition figure who wanted to stop health officials from taking blood samples from his mother. China's authorities, whose nation has substantial interests in African resources and infrastructure, have donated £3.7million to help stave off food shortages in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. With the world's second-largest economy and a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, China is beginning to make larger contributions to international aid efforts. China is Africa's largest trading partner. 'As some said it when I was in Sierra Leone and Guinea, it is only at this time that you know who your friends are, and definitely they see China as their friend,' Mr Sy added. The comments came a day after the World Health Organisation said a breakthrough in the hunt for an Ebola vaccine could be just weeks away. Assistant director general Dr Marie-Paule Kieny said an experimental version could be ready for mass distribution in Africa early next year if current trials in Europe, Africa and the U.S. are successful. She said there are two leading candidates for a vaccine. One of them is developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline from a modified chimpanzee cold virus and an Ebola protein. It is already being trialled in Britain and Mali and will also be trialled in Lausanne, Switzerland. The second was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and known as VSV-EBOV. It has already been sent to the U.S. Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland for testing on healthy volunteers, with results expected by December. The next stage would be to test it more broadly, including among those directly handling Ebola cases in West Africa. Today the WHO's emergency committee on Ebola met for the third time since August to review the scope of the outbreak and whether additional measures are needed. The 20 independent experts have the power to recommend travel and trade restrictions, and have already recommended exit screening of passengers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The organisation has also promised a full public audit of the agency's alleged slow response to the outbreak - by far the deadliest ever recorded. The previous most deadly Ebola in 1976, the year the virus was discovered, killed 280 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The WHO's emergency committee on Ebola meet today to review further measures to control the outbreak . So far only two countries, Spain and the U.S., have had fresh infections outside West Africa. In both cases they arose after contact with patients who had been flown home for treatment. Outside the three main countries, there were also 20 fresh cases of Ebola in Nigeria and one in Senegal - but both outbreaks have now been contained, the WHO said this week. On Friday a British hospital ship with 100 beds set sail for Sierra Leone from Falmouth, Cornwall, after the crew spent a week loading medical supplies. The 574ft RFA Argus has a full emergency department, resuscitation and surgical facilities, a radiology suite with a CT scanner, a critical care unit, a high dependency unit and a 70-bed general ward. It will also be joined by 750 servicemen and three Merlin helicopters. An experimental vaccine could be ready for distribution in Africa, including Freetown (pictured), by January . Practice: A nurse helps volunteer Christof Hoffmanns during Red Cross training in Wuerzburg, Germany . The European Commission has pledged almost £80million to developing an Ebola vaccine, it emerged today. A private-public partnership will plough 200 million euros (£157million) into vaccines as well as drugs and diagnostic tests, two sources told the Reuters news agency today. It is claimed the funding will be announced this week under the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a public-private scheme jointly paid for by the pharmaceuticals industry and the European Commission. Much of the money is likely to be used to help finance large-scale clinical trials of three experimental vaccines, the sources said. Under the plan, the European Commission will contribute 100 million euros, with drug companies belonging to the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations contributing a similar amount in staff time, goods and services.","Secretary general Elhadj As Sy said process will take four to six months .

"Staff at the New York clinic where Joan Rivers suffered a heart attack during a routine throat procedure failed to weigh her before sedating her with Propofol - the anesthetic that killed Michael Jackson - a damning new report reveals. Her daughter Melissa is 'outraged' by the revelations by the New York Department of Health and Human Services, her lawyers have said. On Monday, the department reported that the legendary comic was in excellent health before undergoing what was supposed to be a routine endoscopy at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic. While the doctors who treated Joan are not mentioned by name, they are believed to be her personal throat specialist Dr Gwen Korovin and Yorkville medical director Dr Lawrence Cohen. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Melissa Rivers, right, has hired a top NYC law firm to launch legal action against the clinic where her mother Joan suffered cardiac arrest following a routine endoscopy before her death on September 4 . The Manhattan clinic comes under fire for allowing a doctor without privileges at the clinic, believed to be Dr Korovin, to practice at the medical center. Indeed, Dr Korovin is said to have declared 'I'll go first' as she stepped into the operating room with Dr Cohen, the report says. It also confirms a picture was taken of the star while she was under anesthesia, alongside Dr Korovin . And most worryingly,  both Dr Korovin and Dr Cohen failed to notice that Joan's vital signs were going down, as the report claims they failed to provide 'timely intervention'. Melissa Rivers now plans to 'direct her efforts towards ensuring that what happened to her mother will not occur again with any other patient', her lawyers told Today. In a scathing report, it was determined that Yorkville failed to do the following: . According to the findings, Joan, 81, arrived at Yorkville on the morning of August 28 for tests after suffering chronic reflux. She was in good health and her blood pressure was a normal 118 over 80 when her vital signs were first taken at 8.44am. Her pulse was 62 and regular. Joan's doctors: Dr Gwen Korovin (left)  is Joan's private throat specialist, while Dr Lawrence Cohen was the medical director at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic. Both are believed to have been treating Joan Rivers when she went into cardiac arrest during a routine endoscopy on August 28 . The star was set to undergo an EGD (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy), where doctors insert a thin scope and camera into the area between the throat and upper intestine. However, even though Joan had only agreed to only the ONE procedure, the report states she underwent a Nasolaryngoscopy performed by her personal ENT doctor Gwen Korovin - who was not authorized to practice at the clinic. This was stopped when Dr Koroway said she did not have a clear view. The EGD then went ahead, carried out by Dr Cohen, and Dr Korovin performed a second Nasolaryngoscopy. Worryingly, a staff member told the DHH investigators that Joan was NOT weighed before Propofol was administered. This is 'critical' according to the report. The records note an 'inconsistent' log of the Propofol dosage. Although it says she was given a total of 300 milligrams, the clinic's anestiologist said this was a mistake and only 120 milligrams was administered. Propofol hit the headlines after the death of superstar Michael Jackson in 2009, when it was revealed he had overdosed on the powerful sedative. BFFs: Distraught Melissa posted a picture of her son Cooper and her mother Joan, writing: 'Connecticut, 2004. Mom + Cooper = BFFs... A perfect day. #TBT' Still working: Dr Gwen Korovin is still working at her Manhattan office. She charges $460 for an initial consultation and does not accept insurance. She is believed to have been in the room at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic when Joan Rivers went into cardiac arrest on August 28 . Perhaps the most damning criticism of the clinic comes as the report says 'the physicians in charge of Joan failed to identify deteriorating  vital signs and provide timely intervention during the procedure'. Indeed, by 9.30am, Joan's blood pressure had plunged to 85 over 49 and no pulse was recorded. The report, released after interviews with Yorkville staff and others, says there is conflicting information as to the time that Joan was resuscitated and transferred to Mount Sinai Hospital. Last month, it was revealed that Joan's daughter Melissa Rivers has signed up a Manhattan legal powerhouse and will launch a multimillion-dollar law suit against the endoscopy clinic where the comedienne fell into a coma. Heartbroken Melissa, 46, will file a multimillion-dollar medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit against Yorkville  and is working with top firm Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz. In a statement, attorneys Jeffrey B. Bloom and Ben Rubinowitz said: 'Our client, Melissa Rivers, is terribly disappointed to learn of the multiple failings on the part of medical personnel and the clinic as evidenced by the CMS report. 'As any of us would be, Ms. Rivers is outraged by the misconduct and mismanagement now shown to have occurred before, during and after the procedure. Moving forward, Ms. Rivers will direct her efforts towards ensuring that what happened to her mother will not occur again with any other patient.' ​Rivers’ official cause of death is “anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest during laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation.” The firm needs to obtain Joan's medical records before filing a case in Manhattan Supreme Court and her will also needs to submitted to court and an executor appointed by the judge. Famous clientele: Dr Gwen Korovin, who is believed to have been in the room when Joan Rivers underwent her ill-fated procedure, counts Celine Dion as one of her patients. In the singer's 2010 documentary, Dr Korovin performs a laryngoscopy on the star and they talk about her resting her vocal chords . Today, Dr Korovin's lawyer, Michael Kelton, declined to comment. Dr Korovin is known as the throat specialist to the stars and counts Celine Dion and Ariana Grande as well as a host of Broadway stars among her patients. Previously, Mr Kelton told MailOnline: 'Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients. 'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient. 'For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients.'","Joan Rivers died age 81 on September 4 at Mount Sinai Hospital in NYC .

"A 19th-century plaster cast of Michelangelo's David, which shocked Queen Victoria when she received it as a gift 1856, is set to take centre stage in London. The Victoria and Albert Museum has unveiled the Renaissance masterpiece which will be the centrepiece at the refurbished Italian Cast Court when the attraction reopens later this month. After being gifted to the Queen by Leopold II, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, a detachable fig leaf was sculpted to shield David's manhood and avoid offence. The Victoria and Albert Museum's sculpture conservator Johanna Puisto works on their giant plaster cast of the Statue of David . Puisto delicately works on the 19th-century cast ahead of the re-opening of The V&A's Italian Cast Court . The infamous fig leaf has since been permanently removed, but has become an iconic part of the museum's collection. The V&A's sculpture conservator Johanna Puisto, is putting the finishing touches on the famous cast that so shocked Queen Victoria. While a model of the original, Puisto says the statue should be viewed with the same reverence as its big brother in Florence. 'It’s tempting to think of a cast of a sculpture as something of an inferior copy, but the V&A’s plaster cast of probably the most famous sculpture in the world is much more than a simple reproduction of Michelangelo’s original,' Puisto said. 'It is a work of art in its own right and a superb example of great craftsmanship and technical achievement.' Created by Florentine cast-maker Clemente Papi in the 1850s, the South Kensington museum's five-metre tall David was made from a mould taken directly from the original that was carved from a giant marble block and now stands at the Gallery of the Academy of Florence. The Italian Cast Court at South Kensington's V&A is re-opening on November 29 with Michelangelo's masterpiece at its heart . The cast court, now named the Weston Cast Court, features more than 60 of the V&A's most imposing figures .

The cast courts, now named the Weston Cast Court after long-time supporters The Garfield Weston Foundation, were constructed to showcase the V&A's most imposing figures. When the doors open again they will feature more than 60 19th-century reproductions of iconic Italian Renaissance monuments, including the seven and a half metre-tall electrotype doors cast from the Gates of Paradise at Florence Cathedral, a cast of the pulpit from Pisa Cathedral by Giovanni Pisano and the monumental cast of Jacopo della Quercia’s great arch from the Basilica of San Petronio, Bologna.","The cast of Michelangelo's David at London's V&A is being retouched by sculpture conservator Johanna Puisto .

"A bizarre sighting near JFK Airport has led to a federal investigation after a pilot spotted an unidentified flying object as he landed a commercial jet Monday. The Alitalia pilot was in his final approach into JFK over Brooklyn, New York, just after 1pm when he saw something hovering about 200 feet away. Despite the aircraft's sudden appearance in the sky, it was not in the pilot's way, and he was able to land the commercial jet safely. Scroll down for video . Trouble in the skies? An investigation is underway after an Alitalia pilot spotted what he said was a small drone as he prepared to land at John F. Kennedy International Airport, pictured . Sources told the New York Post that the 'drone' was black in color, and had helicopter rotors on its corners. In an audio recording released last night, the pilot can be heard saying: 'We saw a drone, a drone aircraft.' In response, the tower warns other pilots, telling one: 'Delta 1368, use caution. There was a report of a drone aircraft on about a 5-mile funnel 1,500 feet.' Authorities are now seeking the public's help to find whoever was controlling the aircraft. Special . Agent in Charge John Giacalone said in a statement: 'The FBI is asking . anyone with information about the unmanned aircraft or the operator to . contact us. 'Our paramount concern is the safety of aircraft passengers and crew.' Flying object: The pilot described the 'drone' as black in color with helicopter rotors on each of its corners, similar to the craft seen here . Anyone with information is urged to call the FBI at 212-384-1000. Callers may remain anonymous. The . FAA said that all flights landed without incident, and the agency is . currently investigating.

In a statement to CNN . yesterday, FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said: 'The FAA is investigating a . report... He saw a small, unmanned or remote-controlled aircraft while . on final approach to Runway 31 Right.' While other flights in the area were cautioned about the drone sighting, no other pilots witnessed the unexplained aircraft. Investigators are looking into the fact that the 'drone' may have been radio-controlled model aircraft that wandered into commercial airspace. Under FAA safe operating rules, model aircraft are prohibited from flying higher than 400 feet above ground and no closer to an airport than 3 miles, unless airport authorities have been notified.

Liggett, who faces life in prison, is set to be sentenced on Friday. Police reports say Liggett told officers he found his mother dead on the floor of their home and that she'd committed suicide by taking potassium cyanide. He said he was trying to put her body in a storage shed when he was arrested. When later questioned by police, the former University of Colorado student mentioned his mother’s will and said his ‘definition of right and wrong may be different from what others think.’ Prosecutors claimed that Liggett had an obsessive, years-long plan to kill his mother, reports The Denver Post. Liggett had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in July, but a state mental hospital found him competent to stand trial. Police found Liggett driving around with the remains of his mom, Beverly Liggett, in two plastic storage bins in the back of an SUV days after he killed her . Prosecutors acknowledged Liggett's long history of mental health issues, but argued that he had maintained a ‘method to his madness’ as he spent years buying chemicals and practicing his mixtures in the Centennial home he shared with his mother. Prosecutors said Liggett poisoned his mother with a cyanide mixture on Oct. 14 or 15, 2012, and spent the next 24 hours getting rid of the evidence by dismembering her body in the bathtub. He then placing her remains in plastic tubs full of olive oil, before scrubbing cleaning the house and running a handsaw through a cycle in the dishwasher. Liggett repeatedly told officers they could not prove he was sane. He said he believed people were demons and that he didn't know the difference between right and wrong. But prosecutors said Liggett's actions and comments were calculated and manipulative. A court-ordered mental health evaluation also found Liggett sane. Liggett poisoned his mother with a cyanide mixture on Oct. 14 or 15, 2012, and spent the next 24 hours getting rid of the evidence by dismembering her body in the bathtub at their home in Centennial, Colorado . 'His mental illness is used by him. To his advantage. When he wants it,' said Chief Deputy District Attorney Brian Sugioka. Liggett had spent years harboring a deep hatred for his mother, blaming her for his mental health issues, said Sugioka. Public defender Natalie Girard repeatedly described Liggett's actions as 'completely psychotic' and argued Liggett's mental illness was too severe for him to plan his mother's murder. He was first diagnosed with a developmental disorder at 5 years old and in the following years he was diagnosed with several mental health illnesses and hospitalized five times.","Ari Liggett, 25, of Centennial, Colorado, has been found guilty of the first-degree murder of 56-year-old Beverly Liggett in October 2012 .

"A Christian pastor who converted from Islam is to be put to death for leaving Islam following the ruling of an Iranian court, it was reported today. Youcef Nadarkhani, 34, was arrested more than two years ago on charges of apostasy, and has now been sentenced to death by an Iranian court for refusing to renounce his Christianity, according to the pastor's legal team. The father-of-two had defied a request by the Gilan provincial court, in Rasht, Iran, to repent, and now faces death by hanging. Facing execution Youcef Nadarkhani with his wife and two children in an undated photograph circulated by religious rights organisations . Mr Nadarkhani may be executed at any time without warning, as death sentences in Iran can be carried out immediately or dragged out for years. If the execution goes ahead he would be the first Christian to be officially executed in Iran for religious reasons in 20 years. The married father-of-two was detained in his home city of Rasht in October 2009, while attempting to register his church. Supporters of the pastor say he was arrested after questioning the Muslim monopoly on the religious instruction of children in Iran. Critics have said the execution could be seen as a form of defiance at Western sanctions against Iran in the row over its nuclear agenda. Jordan Sekulow, executive director of The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), told Fox News: 'This is defiance. They want to say they will carry out what they say they will do. 'The world needs to stand up and say that a man cannot be put to death because of his faith. 'This one case is not just about one execution. We have been able to expose the system instead of just letting one man disappear, like so many other Christians have in the past.' Church officials say there may be as many as 100,000 devoted Christians in the country and that Iran's leadership is concerned about the spread of Christianity. Nadarkhani was initially charged with protesting, but charges against him were later changed to 'apostasy' - or abandoning Islam - and 'evangelising Muslims', which both carry the death sentence. He was later tried and found guilty of apostasy in September 2010, and sentenced to death. In June this year the Supreme Court of Iran upheld the death sentence but asked the lower court in Rasht, which issued the initial sentence, to re-examine whether or not he had been a practising Muslim adult prior to converting to Christianity. Nadarkhani told the court during his first hearing on Sunday that he had no intention of returning to Islam. He said: 'Repent means to return. What should I return to? To the blasphemy that I had before my faith in Christ?' However, the court said that because Nadarkhani has Islamic ancestry, he therefore must 'recant his faith in Jesus Christ'. When the court ordered him to 'return to the religion of your ancestors - Islam', Nadarkhani replied: 'I cannot.' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, along with the European Union, France, Great Britain, Mexico and Germany, has condemned Iran for arresting Mr Nadarkhani . Jason DeMars, of advocacy group Present Truth Ministries, said: 'This law dictates what should be done with apostates, depending on what type of apostasy has been committed.' Mr DeMar added that section 6.225 of Iran's controversial legislation says that if a person's parents were Muslims at the time they were trying to conceive a child, and that converts to another religion and renounces Islam, he or she would be a national apostate. He said: 'The death sentence is the penalty for national apostate, but after the verdict is pronounced, he or she will be commanded to repent of what he or she has done . 'If he refuses to repent, he will be killed.' The written verdict of the Supreme Court's decision also included a provision for annulment of the death sentence if Mr Nadarkhani recanted his faith. Although the court found that Mr Nadarkhani was not a practising Muslim adult, the court said he remained guilty of apostasy because he had Muslim ancestry. Mr Nadarkhani's lawyer, Mohammed Ali Dadkhah, told the court that the repeated demand for his client to recant his Christian faith violated Iranian law and its constitution. The last Iranian Christian convert from Islam executed by the Iranian government was Assemblies of God Pastor Hossein Soodmand in 1990. However, several other Christians, including at least six Protestant pastors, are reported to have been assassinated in Iran by unknown killers in recent years.","Youcef Nadarkhani, who converted from Islam, faces death by hanging .

"Waves could soon break in the heart of Melbourne's CBD if a proposal for a man-made floating beach gets the tick of approval. The proposed Docklands Surf Park would produce one to 1.5 metre barrels in Victoria Harbour, complete with a sandy beach  and a 160 metre floatable wave pool with filtered salt water. The project's designers, who expect the facility to cost more than $8 million, say the waves would be surf-able and are currently looking at technologies to adjust the size of the artificial swell to cater for beginners and seasoned pros. The proposed Docklands Surf Park would produce one to 1.5 metre barrels in Victoria Harbour, complete with a sandy beach and a 160 metre floatable wave pool with filtered salt water . Docklands Surf Park is a joint venture between engineering firm Arup and Melbourne-based architect Damian Rogers. 'The whole idea began with the idea of being able to surf in an inner city location. Melbourne has a lot of water surrounding it - we've got the bay and now the Docklands,' Mr Rogers said. 'For us, it's the opportunity to finish work, come down here with your surfboard and have a surf.' The proposal is in its early stages and would still need to get approval from Melbourne City Council, with the engineer company currently looking for funding opportunities other than the government. Docklands Surf Park is a joint venture between engineering firm Arup and Melbourne-based architect Damian Rogers . 'To surf in Melbourne normally requires you to drive down to Bells Beach an hour and a half away,' Urban and Transport Planner at Arup, Phil Carter, said. 'While that's an iconic and amazing space... the convenience of surfing in the docklands is something that we thought was really interesting. 'Going to work, carrying your surfboard down to the Docklands and having a surf - that's a real opportunity.' Surfing Victoria has already backed the plan as a potential hotspot for professional surfing competitions.

"You can lead a lion cub to water, and even make it drink ... just don't try to make it jump across, as this patient lioness learned the hard way. The mother lion tried to make her five youngsters cross a river where a freshly-killed topi was waiting to be eaten in Kenya's Masai Mara last month. Wildlife photographer and Exodus guide Paul Goldstein arrived just as the scaredy cats were preparing to cross. Scroll down for video . Scaredy cats: The cats were being encouraged by the lioness to cross the water to where a freshly-killed topi was waiting to be eaten . Masterclass: The pictures show five cubs being led down to the water, before being given a masterclass in leaping the obstacle by their mother . We will not be moved! But still they would not budge, unwilling to risk setting foot in the cold water . Force: The mother even tried force in a bid to persuade her cubs to cross the river . Cajoled: And still they looked at her blankly from the opposite bank as she cajoled them with every motherly trick she had . Take a break: The lioness then took her young to another part of the stream to try again where they drank some water in preparation . Follow in her pawprints: Time and time again the mother leapt over the stream with Olympic grace only to fail in her persuasion . She, with the help of another lioness, began by giving them a masterclass in leaping the obstacle, padding down on the other side without getting a hair wet. But the cubs were less than impressed and resolutely remained on the bank, refusing to budge. Paul explains: 'This particular morning in October we had an early start from Kicheche Bush Camp in the Mara Olare Conservancy to search for the fabled marsh lions. 'It took a while to find them but finally we spotted a couple of females feasting on a very fresh topi kill. The only problem was the five cubs were on the wrong side of a stream. 'The adults were clearly uncomfortable about this and made several attempts to entice them over but it was chilly that morning and clearly the water did not look lovely to the cubs. Finally: Finally after yet another airborne example from their mother, the two youngest cubs leapt over . Easy peasy: At first it looked like they were going to clear the stream with ease . Splash: But they fell short by a matter of inches, splashing down in the cold water . Made it! They were wet but alive and made it to the other side where their dinner was waiting . Tasty: Moments later they were tucking in to the topi on the other side . Tasty: Once they had had their fill, she gave them a bath to clean off the mud from the stream . Cheeky: And after they were fed, the cheeky youngsters found time to mess about before their mother brought an abrupt end to the fun . 'The whole adventure took almost 30 minutes, there was no-one else there except my three Kicheche land cruisers and the show was incredible. 'Time and time again the mothers leapt over the stream with Olympic grace only to fail in their persuasion. 'They coaxed, they cajoled, they flattered and they even tried picking up their charges but to no avail. It was very endearing to hear the cub's cries of anguish and trepidation. 'Finally after yet another airborne example the two youngest leapt over, getting pretty damp in the process. The mothers then went back for the other three older cubs. 'Finally, they all cleared the river and with stomachs calling tucked into breakfast. I abhor humanising animals and dislike cheesy interpretations of animal behaviour, particularly on TV, but that morning you really had to feel for mum. 'It was a very special half hour which I am unlikely to forget in a while. Fortunately one of my clients David Moxon was filming, we both had big smiles at the end of the water jumps.'

As soon as we have results, we will let you know,' Major news outlet gazeta.ru warned: 'An acrid fog covers Moscow. A strong hydrogen sulphide emission recorded in the Russian capital.' The stench was reported to be coming from eastern districts of Moscow, where a strong emission of pollutants was recorded on Monday. From early morning dozens of phone calls were made to an environmental hotline. Russian Meteorological Station experts confirmed a sulphide emission in the area of Lyublino. 'We can only record a several times higher concentration of sulphide in the air. We can't yet explain reasons for the emission,' said a spokesman. Another highly concentrated 'poisonous cloud' covered the Kozhukhovo area of eastern Moscow.

"Breakthrough: The test, which had an 80 per cent success rate in trials, looks for a genetic 'signature that is linked to a high risk of cancer coming back . Scientists are developing a test to predict which prostate cancer patients are most likely to suffer a recurrence of the disease. It means doctors will be able to give those at high risk drugs to improve their chances. Men who have a low risk of the disease coming back after surgery and radiotherapy will be spared additional treatment. The new test, which had an 80 per cent success rate in a trial, looks for a genetic ‘signature’, or pattern, that is linked to a high risk of cancer coming back. The Canadian researchers will release details of their work today at a conference of the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology in Vienna. Professor Robert Bristow said between one-third and half of patients face a spread of cancer outside the prostate gland that is not detected in initial treatment. He said: ‘Men who fail treatment within two years may be at the highest risk of dying from their prostate cancer. ‘New tests are required that  are better at predicting which patients will have cancer recur. ‘These men can then be offered additional treatments, such as chemotherapy and hormone therapy, that will combat the prostate cancer throughout their entire body . . . in order to improve their chances of survival.’ Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. In the UK, more than 41,000 men are diagnosed each year, leading to around 10,000 deaths annually. The new genetic test was developed by Professor Bristow, of the University of Toronto, and Dr Paul Boutros, of the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research. By analysing the DNA in tissue taken from a tumour before any treatment, it can predict whether surgery and radiotherapy will be successful for that patient. Professor Bristow said: ‘This is the first report of a test using this information derived from biopsy samples that can predict with close to 80 per cent accuracy which men are at high or low risk of prostate cancer recurring.’ The researchers plan further trials over the next two years to ensure it will work in hospitals. ‘If all goes well, this will lead to a new test for cancer patients that can be turned around in three days and will tell doctors which patients will do well with local treatment alone – surgery or radiotherapy – and which will need extra treatment,’ he said. Tumour: Doctors are keen to discover which cancer patients are likely to respond well to treatment . The researchers analysed DNA from 126 patients thought to be at intermediate risk, and followed their progress for eight years. They analysed each patient’s whole genome to identify areas with missing, extra, or irregular sections of genetic material. They found a pattern, or genetic signature, that is common to men at high risk of cancer recurring. They tested their findings on 150 further patients, with similar results. Professor Bristow said: ‘These results will enable us to develop a new way of personalising medicine.’ █ A prostate cancer treatment called brachytherapy, in which low-dose radioactive seeds are placed inside the prostate, could help half of men to retain their sex lives after treatment. Research shows this internal radiation is better than conventional radiotherapy, in which only one-third of men have their sexual function unaffected. It should be offered to all patients, said researcher Dr Renee Oismuller.","New test of genetic 'signature' had an 80 per cent success rate in a trial .

"No vaccine: If the new strain of swine flu was released, it could kill up to a billion people . What was extraordinary about the great flu pandemic of 2018 was not only that it came exactly 100 years after the Spanish flu of 1918, but that it also killed 5 per cent of the world’s population. In 1918, that proportion meant some 100  million people. In 2018, nearly 400 million fell victim. Of those, some one million were in Britain. Nearly every family lost a loved one, with children and the elderly being particularly vulnerable. The NHS was unable to cope with the sheer numbers infected, which ran to around ten million — almost a sixth of the population. With no vaccine available, all that doctors could do was to send people home and tell them to hope for the best. It was the worst natural disaster the world had ever seen. But the virus was no random creation of Mother Nature — it was man-made, produced by an obscure professor at a university deep in the heart of the U.S. This may sound like a science-fiction scenario that would strain credulity but, terrifyingly, it is all too possible. Professor Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison has created a deadly new strain of the 2009 swine flu virus — for which there is no known vaccine. If the virus escaped from Professor Kawaoka’s laboratory it could kill hundreds of millions — perhaps even a billion. Worryingly, scientists seem as alarmed as the general public. Professor Kawaoka revealed what he had done at a secret meeting held earlier this year, and his fellow virologists appear to have reacted with despair. ‘He’s basically got a known pandemic strain that is now resistant to vaccination,’ said one scientist who did not wish to be named. ‘Everything he did before was dangerous, but this is even madder.’ So what exactly has Professor Kawaoka done before? Only last month Kawaoka revealed in a scientific paper that he had also synthesised a bird flu virus — called ‘1918-like Avian’. He had created, through a process called ‘reverse genetics’, a flu virus extremely similar to that which caused the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic. Kawaoka and his team declared that they had made the virus to assess whether variants of the 1918 flu were as deadly to humans as the original virus. After testing it on ferrets, the team found that what they had created, in the dry words of academia, ‘may have pandemic potential’. A patient is given a swine flu vaccination. Compared to the outbreak in 1918, H5N1 has so far been relatively merciful. To date, only some 400 people worldwide have died from the virus . An earlier experiment looked at making another lethal bird flu strain easier to catch. The idea that scientists blithely create deadly flu viruses, essentially to see how deadly they are, caused outrage in the scientific community and the world at large. ‘The work they are doing is absolutely crazy,’ said Professor Lord May of Oxford, a former president of the Royal  Society.  ‘The whole thing is exceedingly dangerous.’ Marc Lipsitch, Professor of  Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, said: ‘I am worried that this signals a growing trend to make “transmissible” novel viruses willy-nilly. This is a risky activity, even in the safest labs. ‘Scientists should not take such risks without strong evidence that the work could save lives, which this paper does not provide.’ Other scientists used stronger language. ‘If society understood what was going on,’ thundered Professor Simon Wain-Hobson, of the Virology Department at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, ‘they would say “What the  F are you doing?” ’ It’s a good question. Professor Kawaoka did try to justify his research last month. He explained that wild birds continue to harbour many variants of the influenza A virus — the strain of virus that can be transmitted from birds, including domestic poultry, through to humans. One of the subtypes of influenza A is called H5N1 — a name familiar to many. Not only was a form of H5N1 behind the 1918 outbreak, but its variants have started to emerge over the past ten years, and are now collectively known as ‘bird flu’. Compared to the outbreak in 1918, H5N1 has so far been relatively merciful. To date, only some 400 people worldwide have died from the virus. However, this is not to say that a new form of H5N1 could not be more deadly, and there are many virologists around the world working on ways to deal with potential pandemics. Professor Kawaoka argues that ‘foreseeing and understanding this potential is important for effective surveillance’. Kawaoka and his team create new forms of H5N1, then study how they function and how easily they can spread. Naturally, the experiments are carried out in extremely secure conditions . To do this, Kawaoka and his team create new forms of H5N1, then study how they function and how easily they can spread. Naturally, the experiments are carried out in extremely secure conditions — although it is alarming to learn that . Professor Kawaoka’s Department of Pathobiological Sciences at the University of Wisconsin is not rated at the most secure level. Laboratories that work with deadly biological agents are graded with increasing levels of biosafety, which range from BSL-1 up to BSL-4. Establishments rated at BSL-4 include the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down in Wiltshire, and the new National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center in Maryland in the U.S. Professor Kawaoka’s lab is rated at BSL-3. Under the strict guidelines, the entrance to the laboratory must be through two sets of self-closing and locking doors, and no air must escape from it. All procedures must be carried out inside a closed biological safety cabinet, into which scientists insert  their hands and arms cased in latex gloves. Often, respirators must be worn, and all staff members are medically screened, and immunised when possible. However some scientists are adamant that the risks are still too high. In a paper published in 2012, Lynn Klotz, a Senior Science Fellow at the U.S. Centre for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, stated that 42 institutions were working with any number of three potentially deadly disease-causing substances — smallpox, the SARS virus, and H5N1. Klotz estimated there was an 80 per cent likelihood of one of these diseases escaping from one of these laboratories in just under every 13 years. ‘This level of risk is clearly unacceptable,’ Klotz said. However, Klotz’s work did not take account of another danger — one that makes the risk of a genetically manipulated virus breaking free from a lab even more likely: terrorism. Even though the idea that, say, militant Islamists, might break into laboratories to release strains of H5N1 seems far-fetched, it is taken very seriously by policymakers. A visual representation of the H5N1 strain of bird flu. Even though the idea that, say, militant Islamists, might break into laboratories to release strains of H5N1 seems far-fetched, it is taken very seriously by policymakers . In 2011, the U.S. National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity called for scientific papers on H5N1 to be censored, which caused fierce debate among scientists. Because of such fears, in 2012 many scientists voluntarily halted research on H5N1. The moratorium lasted for a year, after which the virologists lifted it, stating that the risks from not studying the virus were greater than those raised by the virus falling into the wrong hands. However, many scientists remain deeply uncomfortable with the way some research is carried out on H5N1. Those doubts are sure to be repeated with the latest revelations about Professor Kawaoka. Some, such as Professor Marc Lipsitch, advocate what he calls ‘ethical alternatives’ to the type of approach used by Kawaoka, in which more rigorous risk assessments should be made. ‘In the case of influenza, we anticipate that such a risk assessment will show that the risks are unjustifiable,’ Professor Lipsitch states in a paper he published last month. But despite such calls from their academic colleagues, Kawaoka and other scientists, such as Professor Ron Fouchier at Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, insist that what they are doing is right, and maintain that their work is safe and therefore ethical. But as every scientist knows, there is no such thing as a sure bet. There is always a chance that, one day, someone will walk out of Professor Kawaoka’s laboratory in Wisconsin feeling under the weather. If that happens, then we must hope and pray that those same scientists find a cure —before millions die.","Professor Yoshihiro Kawaoka created a new strain of 2009 swine flu virus .

Police have now set up a forensic tent outside Halliwell's former home in Swindon in relation to the an investigation into Miss Godden's disappearance . After Halliwell took officers to where he buried Miss O'Callaghan in Oxfordshire, Halliwell asked then Detective Supertintendent Steve Fulcher for a cigarette in return for showing police 'another one.' He the took police to a field in Eastleach, Gloucestershire, where Miss Godden's body was found. Despite his confession, Halliwell did not go on trial for her murder because police had not respected arrest guidelines. Miss Godden, a drug-addicted prostitute, was last seen alive by a police officer in Swindon on December 27, 2002. She had not been reported missing to the police because her family believed she was living in Bristol working through her problems. Halliwell killed Sian O'Callaghan, who vanished after leaving a nightclub in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 2011 . This morning, a forensic tent was put up outside Halliwell's former semi-detached house in Swindon and a police officer stood outside while searches were taking place. The house belonged to Halliwell before he was convicted of Miss O'Callaghan's murder, by which time he had moved down the street. The current owners of the house have been forced to move out while police searches take place and have no connection to the investigation. Speaking outside the house, Detective Chief Inspector Sean Memory said: 'I believe this house is linked to the murder of Becky Godden. 'We are focusing our attention on this property as part of the ongoing investigation and have organised a specialist team comprised of over 30 staff. 'These officers are concentrating their search for any items which may be related to Becky's murder or may assist with the investigation into her death. 'We have a number of crime scene investigators who will conduct meticulous fingertip searches of the property. 'This will include the removal of flooring, exploring space behind walls and loft areas and a methodical search carried out until I am satisfied that the entire house has been thoroughly examined.' The search is expected to take around a week. Det Supt Fulcher, who was suspended over his mishandling of the original case, resigned from Wiltshire Police in May this year after he was investigated by the police watchdog and found guilty of gross misconduct. Halliwell has also been linked with the disappearances of at least three other young women across the West Country, but has never been charged. A detective in charge of the latest probe said: 'These officers are concentrating their search for any items which may be related to Becky's murder or may assist with the investigation into her death' The house's current occupants have been moved out during the search and are not linked to the probe . Miss Godden's mother, Karen Edwards, has previously criticised the force's suspension of Det Supt Fulcher, who she credits as a 'hero' for finding out what had happened to her missing daughter. The latest searches come after police teams scouring an area alongside a pond earlier this year found boots thought to have belong to Miss O'Callaghan, along with the remains of a shotgun and up to 600 other items that could be linked to crime. Det Chief Insp Memory said today: 'Each item has now been reviewed and a number are being sent for further expert analysis.' Officers discovered the pile of items under a layer of mud, as well as a chunky knit cardigan. The major effort at the rural spot, near the quiet village of Ramsbury, Wiltshire, was stepped up after the discovery on May 15 of a boot, which police suspect belonged to Miss O'Callaghan. As officers held a press briefing near the pond on May 16 to announce their finding, a second boot was found. Further searches revealed the remains of a shotgun. Detectives suggested at the time that the items found at the site may be the key to solving other murders.

"A Chinese lion dancer who died following a tragic accident at practice last week has been remembered as a funny, talented young man. Tommy Jin Au Yeung passed away at the weekend from injuries suffered while rehearsing in Sydney on Tuesday. The 19-year-old was standing on a fellow performer's shoulders at practice with the Chinese Youth League's lion dancing group at Haymarket last week and was preparing to leap to a platform when he fell heavily. Scroll down for video . Tommy Jin Au Yeung died at the weekend from injuries sustained while at Chinese lion dancing practice last week . He hit his neck on a metal platform, known as a pole in lion dancing, and died in intensive care at St Vincent's Hospital over the weekend. Videos of him perfecting the move that ended his life had been posted on social media throughout the year. 'After a month of hard work with my partner Jonathan, we finally performed our first poles,' he wrote. Aside from his passion for the traditional Chinese dance, Mr Yeung was an aspiring rapper who posted his street battles and solo material online. The death has rocked the 20-odd members of the lion dancing troupe. The 19-year-old (centre) has been remembered as a funny and talented man . Colin Lau remembered the teen as an extremely funny and light-hearted man. 'He was a very talented and promising lion dancer who unfortunately had his life cut short by a freak accident,' he wrote on Facebook. 'Please send your thoughts and prayers to him for the next life.' Another friend remembered Mr Yeung's impressive rapping skills. 'Rest in peace Tommy, the room lit up whenever you entered and you never ceased to amaze with your rapping talent,' Jason Sheridan wrote. '(Chinese Youth League) will never be the same without you.' Emergency services were called to the Chines Youth League in Haymarket, Sydney last Tuesday evening . The Chinese Youth League has been a cultural institution in Sydney for 75 years and is behind the traditional lion dancing performances for Chinese New Year celebrations in the city centre. Damien Baker, who was at the scene of the accident last week said ‘paramedics were initially called with reports of an assault but later learned that he had fallen from stilts.' 'He was dressed in the bottom half of a Chinese dragon costume. I think what probably happened was that the stilts broke, and he was impaled onto one of them on his way down.' 'It took a long time to get him out of the building. When he was taken into the ambulance, they took great measures to block him from the view of the crowd,' Mr Baker said. There was a large crowd of bystanders, medical teams and plain clothed as well as uniformed officers on the scene.","Tommy Jin Au Yeung passed away at the weekend .

"Half of all NHS hospitals have had to temporarily close their maternity units over the past year, shock figures revealed today. The most common reason for closing down the wards was because of a lack of staff or beds. Figures obtained under the freedom of information showed 62 hospital trusts out of 121 respondents temporarily closed units in 2013. Women are being passed from 'pillar to post' when having a baby because of the failure of maternity services, the National Childbirth Trust has claimed . Elizabeth Duff, of the National Childbirth Trust, said: 'This failure of maternity services can mean women get passed from pillar to post when having a baby. This is hugely disruptive to labour.' But Health minister Dr Dan Poulter insisted the units only closed on 'limited occasions'. He said the government had 'increased choice in maternity care' and said there were always going to be times when maternity units would fill up. Dr Poulter said: 'There will always be very limited occasions when a maternity unit cannot safely accept more women into their care and may need to close temporarily. 'Any decisions to redirect women are made by clinicians as part of a carefully managed process.' Dr Poulter said the NHS, which has 162 trusts in England, remains 'one of the safest places in the world to give birth'. But some 12 per cent of the NHS's trusts closed their units at least 10 times in 2013, the figures obtained by the BBC show. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is under pressure from Labour over the growing number of maternity units being closed because of a shortage of beds . Some wards closed their doors to new patients for more than 48 hours until pressures had eased. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust closed its maternity ward 97 times across its two hospitals - the Queen's Medical Centre 48 times and Nottingham City Hospital on 49 occasions. This was followed by Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, with 89 closures across its two hospitals - Leeds General Infirmary, 60 times, and St James's University Hospital, 29 times. The findings come after a poll last year by the Care Quality Commission showed the maternity system in England was under strain. A quarter of women reported being left alone during labour and birth at a time that worried them. There are currently nearly 22,000 midwives in the NHS in England - a rise of more than 1,700 in four years. But the Royal College of Midwives said there is still a shortage of 4,500 because the birth rate is at its highest since the early 1970s. RCM chief executive Cathy Warwick said: 'Birth is unpredictable and sometimes units get a rush of births that is unavoidable and cannot be planned for. 'However, if units are regularly and persistently having to close their doors to women it suggests there is a serious underlying problem.' Labour’s Shadow Health Minister Andrew Gwynne added: 'David Cameron promised three thousand more midwives, but he’s failing to deliver them. 'Across England, too many maternity units are operating without enough staff - unable to keep up with demand - whilst others are facing closure or downgrading. 'Experts have warned the Government on the importance of safe staffing levels, but Ministers continue to ignore the advice. Labour is committed to safe staffing levels based on that expert advice. 'This is yet more proof that you can't trust the Tories with the NHS.' Thousands of women have admitted drinking far more alcohol during pregnancy than the advised four units a week. In the past three years, 2,496 mothers said they had exceeded NHS recommendations – equal to a glass and a half of wine. Four women questioned by hospital staff in Middlesbrough said they had drunk an average 34 units a week – three and a half bottles. Heavy drinking during pregnancy raises the risk of foetal alcohol syndrome, which can leave children physically and mentally disabled. Figures obtained by Sky News via a Freedom of Information request showed around one in 200 pregnant women exceeding the limit. More than half of hospitals could not provide data. Dr Raja Mukherjee, of the national foetal alcohol spectrum disorder clinic at Surrey and Borders NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘This shows a disregard for the effects of alcohol on a developing child.’","62 hospital trusts out of 121 temporarily closed maternity units in 2013 .

"Newly-appointed Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar acknowledged on Monday that he was an upstart in matters related to the armed forces, even as he promised to bring his brand of transparency and fast-paced decision-making to the South Block. “That is my speciality,” said Parrikar, referring to his ability of making speedy and clean decisions. From ruling the tiny coastal state of Goa, which is better known as a tourism hub, to managing the security of the country, Parrikar comes to New Delhi with a reputation of being part of the breed of honest and decisive technocrat politicians. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar files Rajya Sabha nomination papers at Vidhan Sabha Bhawan in Lucknow as BJP leaders look on . He refrained from talking about issues concerning the Ministry of Defence (MoD) on his first day in office, but Parrikar dropped enough hints that he meant business. He advocated the merits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” policy, and the need to develop quickly. Parrikar has his task cut out as Modi only appointed a full-fledged defence minister five months after assuming power. During his short stint as a temporary holder of the portfolio, Arun Jaitley gave a push to several stalled acquisition projects. Parrikar said his predecessor Jaitley had taken decisions despite constraints, and that he would carry forward the task. It will take some time for the former chief minister to settle down as he admitted that he got only five minutes to pack his bags and move to Delhi. After his swearing-in ceremony, he had flown to Lucknow to file his nomination for entry into the Rajya Sabha, as he is not a member of either house of Parliament. In Lucknow, he said the defence minister was defenceless before the press, but he would not let the country go defenceless. The only defence matter he talked about on day one was the sinking of a torpedo recovery vessel off Vishakhapatnam. Parrikar said he would get a brief on the accident as he mentioned another naval mishap involving a fire on board a submarine last year. Parrikar assumes charge at a time when the armed forces are in the middle of a modernisation process and are looking up to the political leadership for speedy transformation. The border with China is calm at the moment and guns have fallen silent on the Line of Control (LoC) and the international boundary with Pakistan. But the two boundaries have the tendency to flare up at any time. His immediate task will be to streamline the procurement process and deliver decisions on several pending big ticket purchases. His predecessor Jaitley had vowed to ensure that the Defence Acquisition Council meets every month. Parrikar is also bracing up for the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament. In the coming days, he will get extensive briefings on the functioning of the ministry. He began by meeting the three service chiefs who called on him together. Defence Secretary R.K. Mathur also called on the minister. The NDA government has opened up the defence sector to foreign investors, but experts say the policy needs to be made more attractive to get maximum benefits.","Parrikar was formerly Chief Minister of Goa .

"A young man who suffered a stroke claims he is being denied life-saving surgery to close a hole in his heart, despite the NHS funding weight loss operations. Scott Elliott has criticised the health service, claiming 'it would be fine if I needed a gastric band'. The 28-year-old suffered a stroke while working as an HGV mechanic. Spotting the signs, his wife Helen rushed him to hospital in time for medics to save his life. Mr Elliott, who has run the London Marathon and played football five times a week, was shocked when doctors told him he had been born with a hole in his heart. Scott and Helen Elliott are desperate for him to have a procedure to close a hole in his heart after he suffered a stroke. But the 28-year-old has been denied surgery on the NHS and must pay for the operation privately . But he is now embroiled in a battle with hospital bosses to have the hole closed - procedure he believes would drastically reduce the chance of him suffering a second stroke. But hospital bosses say the NHS does not currently 'routinely commission' the operation. Mr Elliott’s own consultants have . written asking them to give the go-ahead but the NHS does not believe the . benefits of the operation justify the costs. Instead, Mr Elliott must take a daily cocktail of pills for the rest of his life to reduce the chances of blood clots. He fears it is only a matter of time before he suffers another stroke. Now after battling NHS red tape for more than two years, the couple have decided the best option is to raise the £10,000 needed to fund the operation privately. Mr Elliott said: 'It is like walking round having a ton of bricks over my head, waiting for them to fall and kill me. I want to move on with my life but I can’t until I have this operation. 'I don’t smoke, I eat healthily, I have worked all my life and paid my taxes but when I needed the NHS, it was not there for me. 'What makes it harder to take is when I see people getting boob jobs on the NHS and it seems that I would be fine if I needed a gastric band if I had eaten too much. 'How on earth do they get approval for these things which seem to reward unhealthy lifestyles - what do I have to do to get my operation? 'I did not ask for this problem.' A series of expert cardiologists have told Mr Elliott, who now works for a railway company, there is a 'desperate' need for the operation known as a Patent Foramen Ovale Closure which would close the flap-like opening in his heart. If the flap remains open it could allow a blood clot to travel from one part of his body to the brain causing another stroke. In March 2012 Mr Elliott was rushed to hospital having suffered a stroke. There, doctors revealed he had been born with a hole in his heart. He says experts have told him the operation, which the NHS says it does not currently 'routinely commission', would reduce his risk of suffering a second stroke . Mr Elliott suffered his stroke in March 2012 and has been to more than 50 hospital appointments since then. The process of 'being pushed from . pillar to post' during the past two-and-a-half years has at times left . the couple at their wits’ end. Mr Elliott’s speech can sometimes be slurred which has also knocked his confidence. He . believes it was only thanks to being young and healthy that the impact . of the stroke was not more severe, as he did not suffer any paralysis. Trying to raise the money for the operation has also been challenging for the couple. All people are born with flap-like openings in their hearts. But, for most, the opening closes by itself shortly after birth. In some people, an open flap remains between the two upper chambers of . the heart (the left and right atria). This opening can allow a blood . clot from one part of the body to travel through the flap and up to the . brain, causing a stroke. Currently, there are two main treatment methods for PFO - medicines or . PFO closure, which can include open-heart surgery or a newer procedure . that closes the flap without major surgery. Medications don’t treat the actual PFO, but they can control clotting . factors in the blood so stroke-causing blood clots are less likely to . form in the first place. In recent years, a new approach has been developed, enabling doctors to . seal the PFO without major surgery. An implanted closure device, which . can resemble a tiny two-ended umbrella, is delivered to the PFO using a . small tube threaded to the heart from a vein in the thigh. The implant . is inserted through the flap and released from the tube. He said: 'I feel embarrassed asking people for money. I am quite a . proud man and I have ""put in"" throughout my life, so it’s a hard thing to . do. 'We could sell the house, but we have worked hard to get this and it’s our home and our place where we have settled. 'If . I have the operation on the NHS I would then be able to work, without . question, for another 45 years which would be 45 years of my National . Insurance and taxes going into the pot. 'But if I was to be struck down . with another stroke, that could be me taking out of the NHS for the rest . of my life. 'The costs of the operation would be a drop in the ocean for the NHS.' Mr Elliott had to give up his HGV . driving licence as a result of the stroke. This also dashed his dreams . of becoming a pilot as regulations mean he will not be able to fly. He has raised his concerns with Colchester MP Bob Russell who has pushed the Health Secretary for answers. Mrs Elliott, 32, a photographer, said: 'We have been fighting for two-and-a-half years but we have not got anywhere. 'We have always worked so hard and given back yet when we needed the NHS, we have been pushed around from pillar to post. 'And then it’s so frustrating when we see the decisions by the NHS to fund things like gastric band operations.' A spokesperson for NHS England said: 'We understand how difficult this is and sympathise with the patient who may feel they could benefit from this procedure. 'There is more evidence needed to show that Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) is of sufficient benefit to patients and consequently NHS England’s policy is that it should not be routinely commissioned. 'It is likely that PFO will be commissioned at a limited number of centres during the autumn through its £16.9million ‘Commissioning Through Evaluation’ programme. 'This trials treatments which clinicians have identified as showing significant promise as a potential treatment option. 'Commissioning Through Evaluation is aimed at gathering evidence about services which are not currently routinely funded by the NHS as the existing evidence base does not yet demonstrate sufficient clinical and cost-effectiveness for its routine use.' Josie Cunningham from Leeds, had a boob job on the NHS to boost her confidence . The number of breast enlargements has soared by 145 per cent in a decade to 10,504 – costing up to £52.5million. Many of these will be reconstructions following cancer treatment, but the increase far outstrips any rise in breast cancer diagnoses. In one case, Josie Cunningham had an enlargement after saying her 32A chest was ruining her life. The former prostitute and wannabe glamour model provoked outrage when it emerged she had a £4,800 state-funded boob job at the same NHS Trust that refused to pay for surgery to allow a disabled two-year-old to walk. She later claimed her breasts, which were boosted from a 32A to a 36D, were 'so big' she found them embarrassing, and called on the NHS to pay for a reduction. And barman Sam Barton, 22, of Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, was given a nose job by the NHS – and boasted how easy it was to get the £5,000 procedure. He now says he expects the taxpayer to foot the bill for further surgery, including another nose job, as well as having his ears pinned back and jaw reshaped. The obesity epidemic has also had an effect on the surgery bill, with the number of liposuction operations in 2012/13 standing at 1,926 – up 40 per cent in ten years. The cost in the most recent year will have been up to £9.6million, according to NHS Choices which says the operation costs between £1,500 and £5,000. There has also been a 39 per cent rise in the number undergoing eyelid surgery to 4,966 – costing up to £19.9million. This operation is supposed to be carried out to treat affected vision. And 8,537 nose jobs were carried out in 2013/14 – up 4 per cent and costing £34.1million. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s ludicrous the NHS pays for procedures that are not . based on strict medical needs.’ The figures were compiled by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, following a request from the Daily Mail. Sam Barton, from Sutton Coldfield, who had a £5,000 nose job operation on the NHS . It also showed that up to £20.3million was spent on breast reduction operations, £5.8million on tummy tucks and £5.7million on ear pinning. However, these totals have declined over the past decade. Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told a Westminster lunch: ‘We should not be doing cosmetic work on the NHS.’ Roger Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘There are two types of cosmetic surgery – the type that happens after illness and the sort where someone is just trying to look better. 'We agree with the Secretary of State that this kind of thing is no longer affordable on the NHS. In fact, it is amazing it was ever considered affordable at all.’","Scott Elliott was rushed to hospital having suffered a stroke in March 2012 .

"This is the terrifying moment that two white vans nearly collided in the fast lane of a motorway after one driver passed a drink to another at almost 60mph. The perilous stunt was caught on the dashboard camera of another driver - who was directly behind the two reckless motorists as they headed down the M5. Road safety campaigners have slammed the manoeuvre claiming it could have easily have led to a crash with potentially lethal consequences. Scroll down for video . Close call: As the drink is exchanged, the two vans come agonisingly close to colliding at 60mph on the M5 . 'Risking lives': Road safety campaigners insist the pair should be punished by police for the dangerous stunt . The van drivers, yet to be identified, were filmed on the southbound carriageway near junction three at Halesowen, West Midlands, at around 6pm on September 24. The driver who captured the incident, who does not want to be identified, said the pair were driving at around 56mph and appear to be passing a can of drink between each other. He added: 'I thought it was a crazy and, frankly, a stupid thing to do. I was on my way home. I do a lot of driving as part of my job and I see a lot of stupid things on an almost daily basis. 'You almost become immune to the stupidity, but this was particularly dangerous and it could have ended really badly. Shocking: The van in the fast lane begins to drift left as the driver prepares himself for the dangerous hand over . 'I really expected the vans to come together and for one of them to have his or her arms crushed. It was quite scary.' Police are now examining the footage and said they will be contacting the owners of the vehicles. Road safety campaigners have condemned the drivers, saying they should be punished for risking other people's lives. Philip Goose, senior community engagement officer at the road safety charity Brake, said: 'The video clearly shows that these two drivers were putting other road users and themselves in danger of being killed or seriously injured. Stupidity: As he stretches out his arm to grab the can of drink he begins to lose control of his vehicle . 'Driving is the most dangerous thing we do on a daily basis and it deserves our full attention. Every day, five people die on our roads and a further 61 are seriously injured. 'This kind of irresponsible behaviour on our roads needs to be punished, using the full force of the law.' Chief Inspector Jared White, from the Central Motorway Police Group, said: 'Passing items between vehicles while they are moving at speed increases the risk of a collision and is therefore not only dangerous to those inside the vehicles concerned, but also to other road users. 'With regards to a video which appears to show two vans being driven in this way on the M5 on 24 September, we are currently examining the footage to see if any offences have been committed and we will be contacting the registered keepers of the vehicles about the matter.

"Cholesterol-busting statins could reverse learning disabilities in children and adults, scientists believe. More than one in every 2,500 children are born with the genetic disorder Noonan syndrome. It causes unusual facial features, such as drooping eyelids or a wider than usual distance between the eyes, restricted growth, heart defects and mild learning difficulties. The condition is currently incurable, although scientists have identified eight specific genetic mutations that cause the syndrome. Now tests in mice treated with lovastatin found the drug boosted memory and cognitive ability and promises to help children overcome their learning difficulties. Scientists in California have found the drug lovastatin boost memory and cognitive function in those diagnosed with Noonan's syndrome, an incurable condition which causes mild learning difficulties. File picture . Professor of neurobiology, psychiatry and psychology Alcino Silva at University of California, said: 'Noonan syndrome affects one in 2,000 people, and up to half of these patients struggle with learning disabilities. 'Our approach identified the mechanism causing the disease, as well as a treatment that reversed its effects in adult mice. 'We are excited about these findings, because they suggest that the treatment we developed may help the millions of Noonan patients with intellectual disabilities.' Neuroscientists found statins reversed the learning deficits caused by a mutation linked to a common genetic cause of learning disabilities, the study published online in Nature Neuroscience found. While many genes contribute to Noonan syndrome, a single gene causes about half of all cases. This gene encodes for a protein that regulates another protein called Ras, which controls how brain cells talk to each other, enabling learning to take place. It was discovered that the Noonan mutation creates hyperactive Ras, which disrupts cellular conversations and undermines the learning process. Professor Silva said: 'The act of learning creates physical changes in the brain, much like grooves on a record. Noonan syndrome affects one in every 2,000 people. File picture . 'Surplus Ras tips the balance between switching signals on and off in the brain. 'This interrupts the delicate cell communication needed by the brain to record learned information.' Dr Young-Seok Lee added: 'Hyperactive Ras signaling in the brain is to blame for Noonan's neurological and behavioural symptoms. 'An overabundance of Ras prematurely alters the brain's synapses, leaving no place for the brain to record the changes necessary for learning.' Statin drugs lower cholesterol by blocking the synthesis of certain fat molecules that Ras requires to function. The resulting drop in Ras activity allows brain cells to communicate properly, allowing normal learning to take place. Professor Silva said: 'Noonan syndrome interferes with the changes in brain cells needed for learning, which results in learning deficits. 'Statins act on the root of the problem and reverse these deficits. This enables the process of learning to physically change the brain and create memory.' When the UCLA team treated adult Noonan mice with lovastatin, they discovered that the drop in Ras activity dramatically improved the animals' memory and ability to remember objects and navigate mazes. She added: 'We were amazed to see that statin treatment restored the adult animals' cognitive functions to normal. 'Traditionally, science assumes that therapy needs to start in the foetal stage to be effective. 'Our research suggests that the leading gene mutation responsible for Noonan syndrome plays critical roles not only in foetal development, but also in how well the adult brain functions.'","Cholesterol-busting drugs found to boost memory and cognitive function .

Diagnosis: Brittany Maynard, who had a form of brain cancer, had been given just six months to live in April and decided to move to Oregon so she could die at a time of her own choosing . Grief-stricken husband: Dan Diaz (pictured during an interview with People.com) described his late wife as 'beautiful' The newlywed took her own life on Saturday, November 1, after celebrating her husband's birthday on October 1. Maynard, 29, who was originally from California, had moved to Portland, Oregon, after being diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma, because she wanted to control the timing and manner of her own death. Ms Maynard was diagnosed in January with stage IV glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer. In April, doctors gave her just six months to live. She hit headlines around the world and became the face of the right-to-die movement after revealing her plans to end her own life this month under Oregon's Death with Dignity Act. She passed away in the arms of her husband, Dan Diaz, and surrounded by friends and family in her home in Portland . Barbara Coombs Lee, president of Compassion & Choices, who helped draw up the state's Death With Dignity Act said she wanted people around the world to follow the Oregon's example. 'So many people across the world share broken hearts now because they came to admire Brittany Maynard and get close to her,' she told MailOnline. ‘People who are grieving want to turn to action so I think there are millions and millions of people throughout the world who are looking for a way to make a difference. ‘They are looking for a way to do what Brittany Maynard asked them to do and she asked them to do she asked them to do three things. ‘Number one: love life; number two: love each other; and number three: make end of life choice available. ‘That’s the way to honor Brittany Maynard’s family and I think people all over the world will be looking for ways to do that and Compassion & Choices will be urging them to do that. ‘We are urging them to turn their sadness into action and actually change the laws wherever they live.’ Tribute: Brittany Maynard's mother Debbie Ziegler (pictured) described how her daughter would cartwheel for hours on end until she could do it perfectly. It was a sign of the love and effort she put into everything, she said . Love: She respected Brittany's decision to take her own life, saying it was her job to 'love her through it' Memories: The couple shared one of the last items on Brittany's bucket list - a trip to the Grand Canyon . However Maynard's advocacy of assisted dying has sparked controversy. It was condemned by a senior Vatican official who said there is 'no dignity' in assisted dying. Monsignor Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, head of the Pontifical Academy for Life, made the remarks last week, just two days after Miss Maynard, 29, took a lethal prescription of drugs at her Oregon home. Speaking to Italian news agency Ansa, he said: 'This woman (took her own life) thinking she would die with dignity, but this is the error. Suicide is not a good thing. However Coombe Lee believes that the impact of the story of her death around the world will be to encourage right-to-die legislation. Currently very few countries have such legislation, They include the Netherlands and Switzerland and in the United States it is limited to the states of Oregon, Washington and Vermont. However attempts to introduce it are currently under way in many other countries. In Britain Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the former Labour lord chancellor, is attempting to see legislation through the House of Lords. Connection: Mr Diaz and Ms Maynard are seen on their wedding day at Beltane Ranch, California, in 2012 . Advocate: Barbara Coombs Lee of Compassion & Choices believes that Britanny Maynard's story will encourage people to lobby for right-to-die legislation worldwide . She added, ‘Tens of millions of people have read Brittany’s story. ‘When this many people put their hearts into a cause - officials notice and we’re barraged with requests to respond to Brittany laws.’ Coombs Lee said: 'Movements for human rights and dignity gather strength with aching, frustrating slowness … until the day everything changes … until some compelling event finally turns the tide toward justice. 'For the death-with-dignity movement, that event is Brittany Maynard’s life and death.' She added: 'Make no mistake: Brittany was a brilliant, loving, vibrant, adventuresome young woman. She drank nature’s beauty and grandeur in big gulps. 'Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me … but would have taken so much more. The world is a beautiful place, travel has been my greatest teacher, my close friends and folks are the greatest givers. I even have a ring of support around my bed as I type … . Goodbye world. Spread good energy. Pay it forward!' 'She was deeply committed to being fully present every moment she was alive, appreciating the treasure and wonder of life. But she was a realist, too. She’s was comforted to have medication that, if she chose to take it, would bring a peaceful, rapid death. 'She didn’t take this medication prematurely. In fact, she had it in her possession for months. She took it only when the cruel cancer swelling her brain and crushing it against her skull made living in her body intolerable.' At the end of last month, Ms Maynard, who married Mr Diaz at Beltane Ranch, California in 2012, managed to tick off the last item on her bucket list: a visit to the Grand Canyon. She revealed on her website that she had managed to travel from her home in Oregon to Arizona with her husband, mother and stepfather 'thanks to the kindness of Americans around the country who came forward to make my 'bucket list' dream come true'. Last week Mr Diaz was revealed to have described Ms Maynard as a 'beautiful person on the inside' with a 'personality you really get attracted to' just weeks before her death. Talking to People.com in October, the 43-year-old spoke of when they first met, saying at first glance she was beautiful, but as they grew closer he realized she was also stunning on the inside. 'For me it was meeting the person I fell in love with and that was Brittany. Jokingly, she would say I'd certainly been single long enough because there was an age difference between us,' he said. Debbie Ziegler, 56, Brittany's mother also paid tribute to her late daughter. She described everything from cartwheels as a child to volunteering in Nepalese orphanages that made her only child 'smart', 'charismatic', and 'driven'. https://www.compassionandchoices.org . Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity Act in 1994, but opponents persuaded a federal judge to issue an injunction temporarily blocking the law. Voters in November 1997 overwhelmingly reaffirmed the nation's first aid-in-dying law and it's been in place ever since. According to state statistics compiled through Dec. 31, 2013: . — People who have used the law since late 1997: 752 (396 men, 356 women) — People younger than 35 who have used the law: 6 . — Median age of the deceased: 71 . — Percentage of the deceased who were white: 97 . — Percentage who had at least some college: 72 . — Percentage of patients who informed relatives of their decision: 94 . — Percentage of patients who died at a home: 95 percent . — Median minutes between ingestion of lethal drug and unconsciousness: 5 . — Median minutes between ingestion and death: 25 . — Number of terminally ill people who have moved to Oregon to die: unknown .","Maynard, 29, took own life while in final stage of battle with brain cancer by moving to Oregon to use its 'assisted dying' laws .

"A bodybuilder who suffers from a crippling bowel disease has defied by winning his first fitness competition - while wearing his colostomy bag. Blake Beckford, 33, beat hundreds of hopefuls to be crowned the champion of a national male fitness modelling competition. He had been left devastated when he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2003, just as he was preparing to compete - and his condition forced him to quit. Scroll down for video . Blake Beckford came first in the male transformation category at the Pure Elite event at the Winter Gardens in Margate, Kent. Medics said his bowel condition would make becoming a fitness model impossible . Mr Beckford beat hundreds of other men to win the title, as judges compared his impressive physique to a photo taken just after he left hospital. He posed in nothing but a pair of trunks with his stoma bag visible, saying he wanted to show people with a stoma bag that anything is possible . Mr Beckford said it took him a while to build his confidence back up, and to talk openly about having a stoma . Over the next decade, he was treated with a variety of different drugs to keep the chronic bowel disease under control. He was forced to stop his strict training regime - which had included two-hour gym sessions six days a week - and lost two stone in weight as his muscle wasted away. He thought he would have to give up his dream of entering fitness competitions because his condition meant he was unable to keep his sculpted body in  shape. He lived with the debilitating disease for 10 years until a flare up at the end of 2012 left him constantly fatigued and needing to go to the toilet 20 times a day. By last October, his health had deteriorated so much that he required surgery. The father-of-one was admitted to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford for a sub-total colectomy, meaning his entire colon was removed. Doctors then performed an ileostomy, where the small intestine was diverted through an opening in the abdomen. Mr Beckford - who also needed a further two operations to help him digest food - was then left with a stoma bag on the outside of his body. He was discharged from hospital at the end of November and told by doctors that he would never be able to train at the level needed to be a fitness model. Ulcerative colitis left Mr Beckford tired all the time and needing to go to the toilet 20 times a day (pictured left). Eventually he was admitted for surgery to remove his entire colon (pictured right) Doctors warned the father-of-one after surgery that he would never be able to train at the level required to be a fitness model - but he decided to try anyway . Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a condition that causes inflammation and ulceration of the inner lining of the rectum and colon (the large bowel). In UC, tiny ulcers develop on the surface of the lining and these may bleed and produce pus. The inflamed colon is less able to absorb liquid and this can lead to a larger volume of watery stools. Also, because the colon cannot hold as much as usual, sufferers may have very frequent bowel movements (six or more a day). It’s estimated that Ulcerative Colitis affects about one in every 420 people in the UK. Viruses, bacteria, diet and stress have all been suggested as environmental triggers, but there is no definite evidence that any one of these factors is the cause of UC. Undeterred, Mr Beckford - who weighed 11st 12lbs when he left hospital - started going to the gym in January this year and slowly increased his training schedule. In July, MailOnline reported he had managed to relaunch his career as a fitness model against the odds, and become a personal trainer. Less than a year after his surgery, he has now beaten off hundreds of other men to be crowned the champion of a male fitness modelling competition. Mr Beckford came first in the male transformation category at the Pure Elite event at the Winter Gardens in Margate, Kent, on November 2. He posed in nothing but a pair of trunks with his stoma bag visible as judges compared his impressive physique to a photo taken just after he left hospital. Incredibly, he was also placed in the other two categories he entered by coming 4th out of 20 in 'tattooed muscle model' and 5th out of 40 in 'fitness model under 75kg'. Yesterday, Mr Beckford said he hoped his success in his first ever modelling competition would inspire others with serious health problems. The personal trainer, who lives with his partner in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, said: 'It was my first ever competition. 'I was just starting to get into it over 10 years ago when I was struck down by the ulcerative colitis. 'It was absolutely amazing to be able to go to a competition and compete against and beat people that haven't had to go through what I have gone through. 'I am determined to show people and society that having a stoma doesn't change who you are... You can be attractive, and you can lead a normal life' he said . 'I placed in all three categories that I went in, it was really rewarding bearing in mind it was 12 months since I had my last surgery. 'There is two ways you can react to a major health problem. You can either think it's game over or you can do what I did and say I think I can do it and give it your best shot. 'I just want to inspire others and I get so many messages from people who have had surgery saying they want to get back into their football or other sports which is great.' Mr Beckford was warned by doctors to give up his dream of becoming a fitness model after having the stoma bag fitted last year. But incredibly, after leaving hospital weighing just 11st 12lbs, he has now bulked up to 13st and has appeared in 'Men's Fitness' and 'Muscle and Fitness' magazines. Mr Beckford, who has a son Louie, 12, now plans to give his body a rest before entering another Pure Elite event and the Miami Pro competition in the UK next April. He added: 'When I came out of hospital it was the first time I had in weeks to get used to having a stoma. Mr Beckford achieved his sculpted body less than 12 months after having surgery to remove his colon . 'It took a while to build my confidence again, to talk to people openly about having a stoma, to show anyone what I had. 'But over time I realised that this is me and the operation made me feel like a new person, my energy levels were much better and I could enjoy life more. 'I asked the doctors if I would be able to train and they said there was a risk of hernias and other problems. 'They said to start lifting weights and training to be a physique model would be very unattainable and unlikely. 'But I just thought I am going to go in there and train and see what happens. You know you're own body and I just found myself being able to handle it. 'I did my first photo-shoot at the end of April and after that people began asking more about the bag and I was able to talk about it. 'I am determined to show people and society that having a stoma doesn't change who you are. 'It doesn't mean you're not normal. It means you can achieve anything you want to do, you can be attractive, and you can lead a normal life.'","Blake Beckford, 33, was struck down with ulcerative colitis in 2003 .

"An Adelaide newsreader was forced to endure one of television's most awkward on-air moments when the autocue on his live news report went blank. Left completely to his own devices, Channel 10 sports presenter Nick Butler was forced to improvise through the duration of the two-minute Monday night edition of Channel 10's Eyewitness news. The Adelaide presenter  began by haphazardly stumbling through a wrap of the Commonwealth Games medal tally, before butchering a prerecorded cross to Australian cricket selector Rod Marsh. Scroll down for video . Nick Butler had no idea what he was in for at the start of his two-minute sports broadcast . The Ten Eyewitness News Adelaide newsreader stumbled through the excruciating autocue disaster on Monday night . He spent about 20 seconds of the broadcast fiddling through scripts to try and retrieve the correct one . After a couple of messy references to some Australian cricketers, the camera then awkwardly panned back to co-anchor Rebecca Morse who was looking less than amused by Butler's bumbling antics. Her arms crossed and eyes looking to the sky, it gave Butler all but two seconds to regain some composure - only to spend the next 20 seconds painfully searching for the correct script to his next story. It lead to yet another fax-paus, when he awkwardly crossed to a professional surfing tournament he thought was going to be golf. The women's pro-surfing event at Huntington Beach California was the final segment, before the pair went to a break joking that his on-air performance was worse then their two football side's results at the weekend. Rebecca, who endured the broadcast relatively unscathed, later laughed-off the autocue disaster on her Instagram account by uploading a photo of herself and Nick with the caption 'And that is what you might like to call an unmitigated disaster.'

"Humiliated: A woman (not pictured) was stripped half-naked and paraded on a donkey by members of her village in India after she was accused of murdering her nephew by the dead man's wife . A woman was stripped half-naked and paraded on a donkey through her village in  India after being accused of killing her nephew, police said today. Members of the village also blackened her face with coal dust and cut her hair following orders from a local council of elders in Rajasthan, the police officer said. Thirty-nine people, mostly members of the village of Thurval in Rajsamand district, have been arrested over the incident that took place on Saturday night, additional superintendent of police Sudhir Joshi said. The woman was accused by the village council of killing her nephew who had died some time earlier, the officer said. 'The woman aged around 40 years was in her house when some villagers stormed into the house and pulled her out on Saturday evening,' Joshi told the AFP news agency.. 'They cut her hair, blackened her face and stripped her half-naked. 'Then they mounted her on a donkey and paraded her in the village for ten minutes,' he said. 'It was after a meeting of the panchayat (village elders). 'The cruel punishment was meted out to the woman just on a suspicion,' he said. The nephew, named locally as Vardi Singh, had died on November 2, but police said the circumstances his death were not known, mainly because the villagers had cremated his body without informing officers. The officer said that Mr Singh's wife suspected that his aunt killed him. The villagers blackened her face before mounting her on a donkey following orders from a local council of elders known as 'khap panchayats' who are often accused of dispensing 'Taliban-style' justice (file picture) The woman was now being cared for by family members, the officer added. Councils made up of village elders - usually known as 'khap panchayats' - are common in rural parts of India, especially in the north, where they are often accused of dispensing 'Taliban-style justice'. Their diktats are often unconstitutional and illegal, but they continue to hold sway with rules seen as regressive by women's rights activists. In September this year, 13 men were jailed in West Bengal state for gang-raping a woman who was accused by the local council of 'dishonouring' her village. The council ordered the attack against the 20-year-old woman for the perceived offence of having a relationship with a man from a different community.","Indian villagers followed orders from controversial local council of elders .

"A humpback whale carcass was towed away from Perth's coast on Monday evening after attracting several sharks. Department of Fisheries spokesman Phil Shaw said sharks were seen feeding from the dead humpback whale which measured more than 10 metres in length. The carcass was first spotted by the crew of a vessel returning from Rottnest just before 10am on Monday when it was five nautical miles off the coast. A 10-metre long humpback whale carcass was seen floating  five nautical miles off the coast of Perth on Monday morning . A number of sharks were seen feasting on the dead whale before the decision was made to tow it away from the coast . By 2pm authorities had decided to tow the dead animal out to sea before hooking the animal by the tail, according to Nine News. It was then towed out about 20 miles by a Fremantle Port authority vessel despite warnings that the carcass could break up. Depending on the swell conditions and currents, Fisheries has warned that the whale could drift back towards the coast. Mr Shaw said it was possible the whale carcass would continue to attract sharks. The whale was towed out about 20 miles by a Fremantle Port authority vessel despite warnings that the carcass could break up . People are being told to adhere to any beach closures, report shark sightings to Water Police and regularly check the Surf Life Saving Twitter account. Last week, a 17-metre long humpback whale which washed up on Scarborough beach, northwest of Perth, took council workers several days to remove. The removal procedure, which cost a total of $170,000, infuriated the City of Stirling Mayor Giovanni Italiano and the local council who argued that the carcass should have been towed out to see. The City of Stirling wants the state government to reimburse the cost of the removal. Depending on the swell conditions and currents, Fisheries has warned that the whale could drift back towards the coast . The decision to tow the whale comes one week after a 17-metre long humpback whale washed up on a West Australian beach, costing council workers $170,000 to remove over several days . The decision to tow the more recent humpback away from the coast has come despite warnings of impracticality from the Department of Parks and Wildlife last week. 'In practice, the towing of a whale carcass away from the coastline is an operationally difficult option, with practical difficulties around the size and mass of whales and, in some cases, the advanced state of decomposition,' the department said in a statement according to The West Australian. 'In addition, depending on the size of the carcass, an appropriately powered vessel would need to be identified and deployed to carry out any such towing operation. 'In most cases, given the nature of our coastline, the most appropriate course of action is to wait for the carcass to wash ashore.'","The 10 metre long carcass was seen five nautical miles off the coast of Perth on Monday morning .

"They've been married for only one year, but on Wednesday Amber Rose filed for divorce from her husband, musician Wiz Khalifa. The 30-year-old model, who used to date Kanye West, has reportedly been spending time with her new talent manager Nick Cannon, the estranged husband of Mariah Carey. Rose is asking for full legal and physical custody of their child, Sebastian, aged one, and is allowing Wiz visitation rights. Divorce papers reveal the couple split on Monday and cited irreconcilable differences. Scroll down for video . Headed for a divorce: Amber Rose filed for divorce from Wiz Khalifa on Monday, according to TMZ . Hours after news  of the split broke, sources told TMZ, however, that Cannon has nothing to do with the filing. 'He only learned about Amber's domestic problems through her lawyers last week when he signed her on as a client,' said the insider. 'That's when Nick says he found out her marriage was on the rocks and only then did the two share break-up stories.' No ring here: The cover girl did not wear her engagement ring or even her wedding band when she stepped out in Beverly Hills on Tuesday . It has also been learned the couple had a prenup. 'Amber acknowledges there's a prenup, which you would think would work in Wiz's favor, but she says it's valid, presumably, she's not challenging it,' added TMZ. Legal papers say the prenup provides spousal support. They seemed to be in love: The couple snuggled in Las Vegas at a pool party in May 2013 . A source told the site the split is 'bitter.' Their source maintains both are accusing the other of cheating. Amber stepped out to Wolford in Beverly Hills on Tuesday without her wedding rings, signaling that her marriage was over. That same day she posted a nude photo to her Instagram account. On Friday she had the rings on as she attended the 10 year anniversary of Perez Hilton's blog. And it was only two weeks ago that the short-haired star shared a touching message on her husband's birthday. 'Happy 27th Birthday @mistercap I'll love u forever.... Hope this year is an amazing one for u sweetheart ❤️' The ring was still on five days ago: The beauty wore her wedding bling on Friday at a Perez Hilton party; that's Michelle Trachtenberg on the left . The image was from their wedding. The two were seen in a slow dance. Khalifa looked lost in emotion as he held his new wife tight. Amber looked stunning in a white dress with a diamond necklace on her head. It was a rare image but not an unusual show of love for the marrieds. This filing comes one day after the former stripper reportedly learned several nude photos of her taken on a bed had been leaked by a hacker. Soon after the hacking scandal came to light, Amber took to her social media sites to post a racy photo as a joke, which has since been deleted. 'Well before anyone tries to hack me I figured I’d release a brand new pic of how I actually look from the back,’ she wrote, alongside the image. ‘It’s only right… Enjoy.' Not wasting any time: Divorce documents list the date of separation as September 22, a day before the papers were filed .

"A flagship government policy to improve care for the elderly at home so they don’t end up in hospital has been branded a ‘shambles’ by MPs. They claim it will only save the NHS a third of the cash intended – and even that is ‘ambitious.’ The Better Care Fund is a series of locally-run schemes to boost services for the elderly at home to prevent them becoming seriously ill in A&E. These include making nurses and physios available at weekends, providing more home-help and installing disabled-access toilets and showers. A flagship government policy to improve care for the elderly at home so they don’t end up in hospital has been branded a ‘shambles’ by Labour MP Margaret Hodge (file picture) The policy was first announced by the Government last June but the money – £5.3 billion – will not be made available until next April. In the meantime, local organisations called Health and Wellbeing Boards have been drawing up detailed plans setting out how they will spent their share of the pot. Ministers hope that the scheme will ultimately save the NHS money as there will be fewer, expensive admissions to hospital. They calculate that in its first year of running, 2015/16, it will save the health service £1billion as care at home will be so much improved. But MPs on the Committee of Public Accounts who have been scrutinising the local plans estimate it will save just £314million. And even that amount is ‘ambitious’, they say, as it is based on an assumption that the numbers of elderly ending up in A&E will fall by 3 per cent. This cannot be guaranteed – regardless of how care as improved at home – as a particularly cold winter or severe flu season good lead to many more admissions. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, said the planning of the Better Care Fund was a 'shambles' MPs also claim that NHS bosses did not tell the 151 boards from the start how much money they needed to try and save. This meant that most of their initial plans had to be torn up and started from scratch as they hadn’t taken this into account. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chair of the Committee of Public Accounts said: ‘I am dismayed that planning for the Better Care Fund has been such a shambles. ‘The Fund will not now deliver the £1 billion savings originally expected – savings which local areas were not initially told they should collectively deliver. ‘Now local area plans forecast £314 million of savings for the NHS, which is less than two-thirds of that originally expected. ‘Furthermore the assumption that local areas can achieve a reduction in emergency admissions of 3.1 per cent is a triumph of hope over reality. She also warned that the scheme had lost ‘credibility’ due to the delays and the fact the plans had to be re-drawn. ‘Such incompetence from Departments is unacceptable at a time when the number of people most likely to need care is rising, and overall funding is falling.’ She added. The Mail has long called for improved care for older people at hospital and at home as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Last month the Government announced further details of the Fund and promised it would prevent 160,000 needing to be admitted to hospital a year. They also estimated that a further 2,000 patients would not need to go into care homes as services would be so good they could live independently.","The flagship policy will only save the NHS a third of the cash intended .

"They are two neighbouring countries whose relationship has been severely strained for decades. Despite sharing historical and cultural links, the borders of India and Pakistan are divided by barbed wire with both nations sharing mutual hostility and suspicion. Yet one of the world's biggest multinational companies is trying to change all of that through a new advertising film. Coca-Cola installed high-tech vending machines in two popular shopping malls in Lahore, Pakistan and New Delhi, India. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Breaking boundaries: Coca Cola is attempting to ease the relationship between India and Pakistan through vending machines in which people from both countries can interact with each other . Impressive: The vending machines were set up in shopping centres in India and Pakistan and have a camera and screen user interface which provides a live communications portal linking strangers . Despite the two cities being separated by just 325 miles, the people of both cities could not be any further apart thanks to decades of political tension. However, using the 'Small World Machines', Coca Cola provided a live communications portal linking strangers in the cities. The firm used 3D touchscreen technology to project a streaming video feed onto the vending machine screen while simultaneously filming through the unit to capture a live emotional exchange. The technology used was similar to Apple‘s FaceTime. The machines prompted shoppers in New Dheli to ‘make a friend in Pakistan’ while mall goers in Lahore were asked to meet someone from India. Unique: This father and son take part in the interactive vending machine . Fun: Before they can claim a can of coke, people using the machine are encouraged to complete a friendly task such as wave, touch hands, draw a peace sign or dance . People from both countries who engaged with the screens were encouraged to complete a friendly task together such as wave, touch hands, draw a peace sign or dance before they shared a Coca-Cola. The firm said it hoped to provoke happiness and promoting cultural understanding around the world. In order to produce the film, crews working for Coca Cola filmed through the night and captured more than 100 interactions between people of all ages and from all walks of life. Saad Pall, Coke’s assistant brand manager in Pakistan, said: 'The people of Pakistan and India share a lot of common passions and interests – from food and Bollywood movies, to Coke Studio music, to cricket. 'What this project did was connect people who are not exposed to each other on a daily basis, enabling the common man in Lahore to see and interact with the common man in Delhi. It’s a small step we hope will signal what’s possible.' The poor relations between India and Pakistan are defined by the violent partition of British India in 1947 and also the territorial dispute over the  Kashmir region. There have been numerous military conflicts between both countries. The Kashmir conflict is a territorial dispute between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region, the northwestern most region of South Asia.","High-tech vending machines fitted in Lahore and New Delhi shopping malls .

"Fire chiefs have been accused of 'burning money' after spending £17,000 on bizarre plastic hands for people to press buttons on their smoke alarms. The 2ft-long red plastic sticks with a white hand and pointing finger at the end were paid for out of public money. And householders are given the pointers during home fire safety checks - to show them how to press the test button on ceiling-mounted smoke alarms. Waste? These 2ft-long red plastic sticks with a white hand and pointing finger at the end were paid for out of public money . But the cost of £1.75 a stick was branded a waste when people can just use their own fingers or any stick or broomhandle to test the alarms. Fire Authority member Gordon Walker said: 'It is absolutely ridiculous waste of money, particularly when budgets are so tight for public services. All people have to do is use a broom handle or something similar'. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service bought a total of 10,000 of the sticks, at a cost of £1.75 each - a total of £17,500. The sticks are approximately 24in long or just over two foot including the pointing finger. But they were blasted as a 'pointless laughing stock' by some householders. One homeowner said: 'It looks like a comedy toy or a backscratcher rather then something the fire service should be spending its money on.

"US President Barack Obama has backed a 'free and open Internet' and called for tough rules to protect against putting online services that don't pay extra fees into a 'slow lane.' Obama endorsed an effort to reclassify the Internet as a public utility to give regulators more authority to enforce 'net neutrality,' which bars ISPs from opening up 'fast lanes' for services that pay fees for better access. In a statement, Obama said he wants the independent Federal Communications Commission to 'implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality.' Scroll down for video . Obama said he wants the independent Federal Communications Commission to 'implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality.' Obama's comment comes amid heated debate among online industry sectors as the FCC seeks to draft new rules to replace those struck down this year by a US appeals court, which said the agency lacked authority to regulate Internet service firms as it does telephone carriers. ''Net neutrality' has been built into the fabric of the Internet since its creation -- but it is also a principle that we cannot take for granted,' Obama said in a statement. 'We cannot allow Internet service providers to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas.' Obama said that while the FCC is an independent agency, he wants the regulatory body to maintain key principles of net neutrality. He said the rules should ensure 'no block' of any legal content, to ensure that an Internet firm does not block one service such as Netflix to promote a rival one. Another key principle endorsed by Obama would prohibit 'paid prioritization' that would allow one service to get into a faster lane by paying extra. 'No service should be stuck in a 'slow lane' because it does not pay a fee,' Obama said. 'That kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet's growth. Under the plans for priority usage, Netflix and other video providers would pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers, and maintain and improve streaming quality and reliability. This is being heavily criticised by net neutrality campaigners. At the heart of net neutrality is an open internet in which all data being sent from websites to customers is treated the same, regardless of size or destination. All this traffic is given the same priority along the same lanes and no site is given preferential treatment. Although it seems like a fair model, in which sites that use the most bandwith pay the most money, campaigners claim it will drastically impact on industry competition. For example, Netflix has the money to pay for better service, using the fast lanes, while smaller companies don't. This means smaller companies may have the same range of content, but because they can't stream at the same quality, they are effectively priced out of the market. To address these claims, the new rules include a 'competition test'. ISPs would need to decide if a website meets the critieria to be given priority access and that this bar must be set high enough to protect competition. 'So, as I have before, I am asking for an explicit ban on paid prioritization and any other restriction that has a similar effect.' Obama said he wants the rules to bar any 'throttling' or slowing of content at the discretion of the service provider. He also said he wants the same rules to apply to mobile broadband, which was not covered in the earlier regulations. To accomplish this, Obama said the rules should reclassify consumer broadband service as a public utility -- a move that has been fiercely opposed by the companies that would be affected. Obama's statement places him squarely in the camp of many consumer activists and online services and against industry sectors involved in Internet delivery. The FCC is redrafting its rules after the court decision struck down its regulations in a case brought by US broadband giant Verizon. Verizon and its allies have argued that the FCC lacks authority to interfere with their business, and that Congress never decided these companies were regulated utilities or 'common carriers.' Telecom firms reacted angrily to the move. Scott Belcher, who heads the Telecommunications Industry Association, said the reclassification 'would set the industry back decades, and threaten the private sector investment that is critically needed to ensure that the network can meet surging demand.' In a Seattle Times column Sunday, National Cable & Telecommunications Association chief Michael Powell said this kind of regulation is 'a rusty sledgehammer that has been sitting in the garage for 20 years.' Walter McCormick at the US Telecom Association said Obama's proposal would be 'a shift that will redefine the Internet, insert the government deeply into its management and invite other countries to do the same.' US President Barack Obama speaks during a press conference on November 5, 2014 in Washington, DC. He said the new rules should ensure 'no block' of any legal content, to ensure that an Internet firm does not block one service such as Netflix to promote a rival one. However, many in the industry backed the President. The Internet Association, a lobbying group that . represents Web companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon.com and Netflix, said: . 'The Internet Association applauds President Obama's . proposal for the adoption of meaningful net neutrality rules . that apply to both mobile and fixed broadband. 'As we have . previously said, the FCC must adopt strong, legally sustainable . rules that prevent paid prioritization and protect an open . Internet for users.' Chad Dickerson, chief executive of Etsy Inc, an . online marketplace that focuses on handmade and vintage items, said: 'I'm thrilled to see President Obama stand with Etsy and our . sellers in calling for strong net neutrality rules under Title . II. 'The president has proved that he truly is a champion of the . Internet. I urge (FCC) Chairman Wheeler to follow suit.' FCC chairman Tom Wheeler welcomed Obama's statement but offered no timetable for the new rules. 'Like the president, I believe that the Internet must remain an open platform for free expression, innovation, and economic growth. We both oppose Internet fast lanes,' Wheeler said in a statement. But he noted that reclassification poses 'substantive legal questions,' and that the agency needs time 'to ensure that whatever approach is taken, it can withstand any legal challenges it may face.'","Calls to 'implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality'

"Archbishop Paul Gallagher, 60, claimed diplomatic immunity to avoid handing documents to prosecutors investigating two paedophile priests . A British archbishop, appointed by Pope Francis as his new foreign minister, claimed diplomatic immunity to avoid handing over Vatican documents to prosecutors investigating two paedophile priests. Archbishop Paul Gallagher, 60, from Liverpool was promoted on Saturday to the third highest position in the Vatican as part of a reshuffle by Francis. But the appointment of the former papal envoy to Australia to the Vatican's most senior hierarchy will be a blow for campaigners against clerical sex abuse. Earlier this year the United Nations said it was 'concerned' after Mr Gallagher cited diplomatic immunity in response to repeated requests by prosecutors for documents on two priests that abused more than 100 children  over 40 years. A report by the UN Committee against Torture reported that the Holy See was still 'resisting the principle of mandatory reporting of allegations to civil authorities', and withholding information, citing Gallagher by name. Only after months of bureaucratic wrangling and an embarrassing diplomatic standoff did the Archbishop eventually agree to turn over some of the documents which were wanted as part of an inquiry into Australia's worst abuse scandal. The Maitland-Newcastle diocese has been described as the country's 'epicentre' of Catholic clerical abuse with 400 known victims. Gallagher was asked for information on Father Denis McAlinden, an Irish priest who preyed on pre-pubescent girls was known to the church as a paedophile since the 1970s but for decades he was moved from parish to parish in Australia and posted overseas to New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines. He was eventually defrocked in a secret process in exchange for 'keeping his good name'. The documents requested also referred to Father James Fletcher, who was convicted of abusing four victims over three decades including the rape of an altar boy, a crime for which he was sentenced to almost eight years prison, where he died in 2006. Copies of correspondence released by the New South Wales Special Commission of Inquiry show prosecutors requested documents from Gallagher on 30 August 2013. The nuncio sent an interim response, stating that he was submitting the request to Rome but after no response almost two months later the prosecutors were forced to write again to both Gallagher and the Vatican to follow up the request. Pope Francis recently appointed Mr Gallagher as his new foreign minister, the third highest position in the Vatican . Three weeks later Gallagher eventually replied reminding the commissioner that his office was 'the high diplomatic representative of the Holy See to the Commonwealth' and cited 'the protections afforded by international agreements, including the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations'. The convention states that the archives and documents of a diplomatic mission 'shall be inviolable at any time and wherever they may be'. Without this 'high principle of international relations' 'diplomatic missions would no longer be able freely to carry out their domestic and international responsibilities', he claimed. He was asked about Father Denis McAlinden, an Irish priest who preyed on pre-pubescent girls and was known as a danger   since the 1970s . He said his office would consider 'specific requests' for information, 'bearing in mind the expectation that it would not be appropriate to seek internal communications'. On 14 November the NSW crown solicitor, Ian Knight, wrote to Gallagher for a third time. In his letter Knight reminded the nuncio of a guarantee by Cardinal George Pell that 'every document the Vatican had' would be made available to a separate inquiry into child sexual abuse in the same year. 'Of course, this Commission is separate and distinct from both the Royal Commission and the Victorian Parliamentary Inquiry,' Knight wrote, ' 'But I trust that the sentiment of co-operation would similarly extend to this Commission's processes.' Eventually on 6 December 2013 Gallagher forwarded copies of correspondence between the Bishop of Maitland−Newcastle and the then Nuncio, as well as other letters, which the commission already had copies of. But he declined to forward any 'internal communications', between the Vatican diplomatic missions in Australia and in the Philippines saying 'Such communications are confidential, as is the case for those of the diplomatic missions of any country.' Gallagher was appointed following the demotion of ultra-conservative American Cardinal Raymond Burke, who has led open opposition to Pope Francis' leadership saying the church is 'without a rudder'.","Archbishop Paul Gallagher appointed by Pope Francis as foreign minister .

"More than one million immigrants will have the right to vote in the General Election - despite not being British citizens. New arrivals from Commonwealth countries - including Australia, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Nigeria - automatically acquire voting rights on arrival in the UK even if they are only staying for a short time. Research by the MigrationWatch campaign group estimates that by the time of the 2015 poll, more than one million Commonwealth citizens will be allowed to vote despite not having a British passport. Political influence: More than one million immigrants will have the right to vote in the General Election despite not being British citizens, according to research by the think tank Migrationwatch . Even a student on a six month visa has exactly the same voting rights as long-term residents, as long as they have an address, the research shows. By contrast, the countries where they come from do not offer the same rights to Britons living there. Sir Andrew Green, the group’s chairman, said the rules were an ‘anachronism’ from the days of Empire and should be scrapped. He warned they could have a significant impact on the result of the election. Sir Andrew said: ‘If the next election is close, and especially if there is a coalition negotiation, the number of seats gained by each party will be critical, so the outcome could be significantly influenced by a group of people who have not yet qualified to become British citizens or have not even bothered to do so. 'Absurd': Sir Andrew Green, the chairman of MigrationWatch, said the rules were an 'anachronism' from the days of Empire and should be scrapped . ‘One example is that a student visitor from a Commonwealth country planning to study for six months would be allowed to enrol on the electoral register and vote in a parliamentary election if one was held during the duration of his or her stay.’ ‘This is clearly absurd. The issue is one of basic fairness. If people want to participate in deciding the future of our country they should at least become citizens.’ Official figures suggest that in 2011 there were 960,000 Commonwealth citizens living in England and Wales. They include 266,000 Indian nationals, 130,000 Pakistani nationals, more than 51,000 South Africans, 60,000 Australians, 51,000 Bangladeshis and 37,000 Sri Lankans. There are also tens of thousands from Zimbabwe, Canada and Ghana. Apart from a few Caribbean states, British citizens do not have similar rights in Commonwealth countries. If the turnout is close to the national average, this could amount to more than half a million votes from non-citizens. In 2007 a review by the then Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, called for the rules to be scrapped, and for the Government to make a ‘clear connection between citizenship and the right to vote’. The review concluded ‘Ultimately, it is right in principle not to give the right to vote to citizens of other countries living in the UK until they become British citizens.’ However, its conclusions were never acted upon. Sir Andrew said: ‘The public will be astonished to learn that nearly a million foreign citizens from countries that do not allow British residents to vote in their countries are, nevertheless, allowed to vote in all British elections. ‘This is a hangover from the days of Empire and should not have been allowed to continue, especially given the rapid increase in immigration from Commonwealth countries.’","New arrivals from the Commonwealth automatically acquire voting rights .

Despite the passage of time and two new owners, VHS tapes are still left spilling out of a broken cardboard box, while other images show wallpaper peeling away from the slime-covered walls. There were failed plans to turn the 11-acre site into a business park until it was sold on to developer Phil Collins for £720,000 in March 2011. His grand scheme was to build 100 houses and a care home on the site of the hospital - but Mr Collins, of Pontrilas, Herefordshire, was defeated by angry neighbours who said it would compromise the beauty of the national park. Supported by groups including Save Britain's Heritage, the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority rejected his bid to demolish the hospital two years ago and it now sits in limbo, full of asbestos. Archaic: Parts of the dirty floor are strewn with abandoned VHS tapes which have spilled out of a water-damaged cardboard box . Controversy: There were plans to turn the 11-acre site into 100 houses and a care home, but they were seen off by furious neighbours . The doctor will see you now: Empty chairs sit unclaimed in the old consulting rooms and offices, surrounded by moss and peeling paint . Crumbling: Parts of the Edwardian building have disintegrated since the closure of the NHS hospital, which once had its own farm . The campaigners have since taken Wales' National Assembly politicians round the site, which is now a stomping ground for urban explorers, in a bid to show how crucial it is to the nation's history. But Mr Collins has said it was 'completely mad' to prevent the hospital being knocked down - especially as it has failed to be listed by Cadw, the Welsh equivalent of English Heritage. He added: 'The petition is being driven by a small group of people working together and who prepare a petition simply because they do not want something to happen. The petition is highly simplistic as it only offers one viewpoint... with no knowledge of the site.' Originally called the Brecon and Radnor Joint Counties Lunatic Asylum, the hospital was built for £126,000 and opened in March 1903. Performing the opening ceremony, Lord Glanusk reportedly said: 'Everything has been done that human ingenuity could devise for the happiness and safety of the inmates, and under the blessing of God, for their speedy restoration to health.' The hospital had residential wards, a large recreation and dining hall, kitchens, workshops and a tailor, bakery and shoe-maker. By 1914, it was one of 102 registered 'lunatic asylums' across Britain, many of them beautifully-designed Victorian buildings. Theatrics: The fully-functional psychiatric hospital once cared for hundreds of patients and has a stage on which they could perform . Eerie: The brickwork is exposed in the corridors, left to rack and ruin as developers tried first to build a business park, then 100 homes . Ramshackle: The hospital was under the control of the NHS for 51 years, bringing with it art, occupational therapy and mixed-sex wards . Messy: The hospital was also home to the Mid and West Wales College of Nursing and Midwifery and an alcohol and drug abuse clinic . The Brecon asylum was even noted for its large windows, which gave patients wide views over the beautiful Welsh countryside. But Britain's attitude to mental health was far from idyllic - with fewer than half of patients being discharged from 'asylums', with many misunderstood by the authorities or given controversial treatments such as electric shock therapy. In 1948 the hospital became part of the newly-formed NHS, bringing with it art, occupational therapy and the integration of the sexes, who had occupied opposite sides of the symmetrical complex. The site also became home to the Mid and West Wales College of Nursing and Midwifery and the Powys Drugs & Alcohol Council for substance misuse. When the derelict building was given a reprieve, Save Britain's Heritage President Marcus Binney said: ‘The nation’s disused mental hospitals have been the focus of one of our longest and most sustained campaigns. 'Many were designed by leading architects, very well-built of very excellent materials and sited on south-facing slopes to enjoy maximum fresh air and sunlight. All over Britain, one developer after another has proved they can be successfully converted.’ Snub: Despite protests by history-lovers, the building failed in its bid to be listed by Cadw, the Welsh equivalent of English Heritage . History: The hospital pictured in the days when it was fully operational. It was built to afford wide views over the Brecon Beacons .","There were failed attempts to turn derelict Mid Wales Hospital in Brecon Beacons into homes and a business park .

"David Blunkett is one of Labour’s moderates and was a key ally of Tony Blair, but ‘Red Ed’ Miliband’s party has chosen an extremist to succeed him. In a vivid reflection of the sharp Left turn that Labour has taken under Miliband, the party has selected Harry Harpham, a former coal miner who specialises in abuse of Margaret Thatcher. He will be Labour’s General Election candidate for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, where Blunkett — who is stepping down after 28 years in the House of Commons — enjoys a thumping 13,632 majority. Unapologetic: Former coal miner Harry Harpham (second from left), soon to become a Labour General Election candidate, posted this photograph on social media of himself celebrating the death of Margaret Thatcher . On the day Baroness Thatcher died of a stroke at the age of 87, Harpham posted a photograph on social media of himself celebrating the death of the former Prime Minister. The picture showed Harpham grinning as he raised a pint glass and giving a thumbs up to mark her demise with fellow Labour councillors in Sheffield. ‘Having one for Maggie with some good comrades,’ he wrote in the caption. Harpham worked at Clipstone Colliery, near Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, at the time of the 1984-85 miners’ strike. Blamed: Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . His colleagues were horrified by the militant stance taken by NUM leader Arthur Scargill, who hoped to use the strike to bring down Thatcher’s government, in the same way that the trade union had helped to destroy Sir Edward Heath’s Conservative administration with its industrial action in 1974. In protest against Scargill, Harpham’s Nottinghamshire colleagues set up a moderate, rival organisation, the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, and returned to work. However, Harpham stuck with Scargill. ‘Arthur was spot on,’ he later said. ‘I was proud to have been a very active member of the NUM during the strike.’ The councillor refuses to apologise for his tweet about Lady Thatcher’s death last year. ‘Undoubtedly, her family will feel loss, but my thoughts are towards those communities she destroyed,’ he says. Despite Labour being in power for 13 of the 24 years since Mrs T was forced out of 10 Downing Street, Harpham continues to blame her for Britain’s difficulties. ‘Everything that is wrong with this country can be traced back to Thatcher,’ he claimed just ten days ago. Sounds like he will be a sure-fire bet for promotion under Marxist historian’s son Miliband.","David Blunkett is one of Labour’s moderates and was key ally of Tony Blair .

"Salah Salahadyn was sentenced to seven years in prison for stealing a $5 million Stradivarius violin . The man accused of masterminding the theft of a 300-year-old, $5 million Stradivarius violin that was snatched from a musician in Milwaukee was sentenced Monday to seven years in prison. Salah Salahadyn, 42, once told an acquaintance that such a theft was his dream crime because of the instrument's value and the ease of grabbing it from a musician walking down the street. The centuries-old instrument was stolen in January from Frank Almond, a concertmaster at the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, as he walked to his vehicle following a performance. Almond was attacked with a stun gun during the theft. The instrument was missing for nine days before police found it, in good condition, in a suitcase at the Milwaukee home of Salahadyn's acquaintances. Police said the homeowner didn't know what was in the luggage stored in his attic. Salahadyn faced up to a decade in prison plus five years of extended supervision after he pleaded guilty in October to being party to felony robbery. Along with the prison term, Judge Dennis Moroney ordered Salahadyn to serve five years of extended supervision. The violin theft wasn't Salahadyn's first art crime. He pleaded guilty in 2000 to trying to resell a $25,000 statue to the art gallery owner from whom it had been stolen in 1995. His ex-girlfriend told investigators that while he hadn't stolen the statue, he plotted the theft. Another man charged in the violin theft, Universal K. Allah, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison after pleading guilty in May to the same charge as Salahadyn. Recovered: The instrument was missing for nine days before police found it, in good condition, in a suitcase at the Milwaukee home of Salahadyn's acquaintances . Prosecutors said Allah provided the stun gun used to attack Almond. The musician has said he was lucky he didn't suffer a career-ending arm or wrist injury when he crumpled to the icy pavement that night. Stradivarius violins were crafted by renowned Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari. Many are owned by private collectors who lend them to top violinists to be played in symphonies. Experts say a Stradivarius violin deteriorates if it's not used but remains in good condition when played regularly. The owner of the stolen violin has remained anonymous. Experts estimate that 600 to 650 Stradivarius instruments remain, or about half of what the master produced. Although they can be worth millions of dollars, they are rarely stolen because they're cataloged so well that a thief would have a hard time selling one.","Salah Salahadyn, 42, stole the instrument in January from Frank Almond, a concertmaster at the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra .

"Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon has described his terminal colon cancer as the 'most amazing experience of my life', because he is surrounded by his loved ones and donating his estimated $100 million fortune to his passion - animal rights. Given three months to live in 2012, Simon immediately decided to team up with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) president Ingrid Newkirk, and dedicate his time to the rescue of maltreated animals and conservation. Having defied that diagnosis’ original death sentence, Simon continues to push ahead and has also funded projects such as 'Feeding Families' to help with the underprivileged in inner cities. And now, as he enters the twilight of his life, has declared himself never happier and finally at peace. Scroll Down for Video . Charity: Sam Simon told NBC's Maria Shriver that he finds cancer as inspiring as it is daunting . Creators of The Simpsons Matt Groening, James Brooks, and Sam Simon, right, are interviewed about the hit show in the early 1990s . 'They showed me my scans', said Simon to NBC's Maria Shriver Project during an interview from his Los Angeles mansion. Philanthropy: Simon, 59, will donate his estimated $100 million fortune to charity . 'They said these are the scans of a dead man. I said, 'Is it curable?' And they said, 'We don't use that word.' 'I will say that the doctor said, 'I can't cure you, but my job is to keep you alive. And he has done a remarkable job of it. 'He has done great. I have never been happier, so thank you doctor.' However, Simon did not shrink from the realities of his condition, nor fail to inject some trademark humor. 'Cancer is a horrible disease. I am struggling with it,' said Simon to NBC. 'Its everything that everybody always tells you. It's a journey, it's a fight. But, if you want publicity and you want to pick up girls, then cancer is the greatest thing in the world.' Simon has no children and is not married so he wants to give his millions to causes he cares about. He was married to actress Jennifer Tilly in the 1980s but divorced in 1991 though they remain close. Having already lived almost one year longer than doctors initially gave him, Simon told Maria Shriver that amazingly, his happiness was a direct result of his cancer diagnosis. 'Somehow I ended up surrounded by people who love me and take care of me and will do anything for me. That is called happiness. I think I may have had a problem letting it in before. 'Cancer has been a fight, a journey, an adventure and the most amazing experience of my life.' Hollywood mogul and co-creator of The Simpsons, Sam Simon, looks at cages at a chinchilla farm after he financed the purchase of the facility by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) in order to rescue over 400 chinchillas and shutter the business in Vista, California, in August . Sam Simon, who made a fortune as co-creator of The Simpsons, is enjoying giving away untold millions as he battles terminal colon cancer.  The nine-time Emmy-winning writer-producer, 58, says he is using his wealth to, among other causes, help shut down roadside zoos and abusive animal shows, fund a dog-rescue haven in Malibu, and fight hunger. Simon, 58, is spending his final months funding projects that feed homeless people and save animals from being killed in animal shelters. 'I have used my money along with Ingrid Newkirk, the founder of PETA,' said Simon to NBC. 'She came up with almost a therapy for me, where we planned and are still planning a series of animal liberations and actions that I get to participate in and enjoy. 'It gives me something to look forward.' 'I get to watch these animals that have been in concrete bunkers their whole lives take their first step on grass.' Simon created the hit cartoon alongside Matt Groening in 1991. He technically retired from The Simpsons in 1993, but still receives tens of millions in royalties every season. Asked why he decided to dedicate his fortune and final months to animal rights, Simon was unequivocal. 'The thing about animals that speaks to me so much is that my passion for the animals and against animal abuse is based on the knowledge that these creatures which think and feel can't speak for themselves,' said Simon to NBC. 'I feel it is my responsiblity to speak for those who can't speak for themselves.' Appreciation: Pamela Anderson kisses Sam Simon during award ceremony for her contribution to 'Mercy For Animals' Simon grew up comfortably in Beverly Hills, where his father was in the garment industry, not showbiz. After turning his drawing talent into a job at an animation studio that made cartoons for kids, Simon submitted a script, on spec, to the ABC comedy ‘Taxi.’ His script was bought and produced, and Simon, in his 20s, was hired as a staff writer and soon rose to be the showrunner. From there he joined a new NBC sitcom called ‘Cheers,’ where he was staff writer for its ascendant first three seasons. In 1987 he became a writer and executive producer on the Fox comedy series ‘The Tracey Ullman Show,’ teamed alongside James L. Brooks, the comedy legend with whom he had worked on ‘Cheers’ and ‘Taxi,’ and, of course, cartoonist Matt Groening. They became the founding fathers of ‘The Simpsons.’ ‘The Simpsons’ began as interstitial cartoon clips aired during the otherwise live-action ‘Ullman’ show until, in 1989, it was spun off as a Fox half-hour of its own. Simon was named creative supervisor, and he hired the first writing staff as well as creating several Springfield citizens, including Mr. Burns, the cadaverous industrialist, and Dr. Hibbert, the buffoonish physician. Although Simon remained the least-known of the three creators, by many accounts he was the most hands-on. ‘You can't overstate his contribution to “The Simpsons,'"" says talk-show star Conan O'Brien, who was a ‘Simpsons’ writer and producer in the early 1990s. ‘No one's smarter than he is.’ Writer Sam Simon and TV personality Dr. Drew Pinsky attend Pinsky's unveiling of a new PETA campaign to cure animal homelessness on August 8, 2012 in Los Angeles, California . The show - TV's first successful prime-time animated series since ‘The Flintstones’ nearly three decades before - caught the public off-guard with its sly but perceptive look at the culture. ‘With “The Simpsons,” people didn't know what they were gonna see,’ says Simon. ‘They didn't have a clue.’ The show was given time and free reign to flourish by the fledgling Fox network. ‘I don't think you get that sort of creative freedom with any broadcast shows today.’ Simon left ‘The Simpsons’ after its fourth season in 1994 owing to a strained relationship with Groening. But it was a lucrative departure. His exit deal entitled him to royalties from ‘The Simpsons’ that, as it enters its 25th season this fall, annually pad Simon's wallet by tens of millions of dollars. He has played no role on the show in nearly 20 years (not even watching it, he says), even as his name remains in the weekly credits along with Groening's and Brooks' - and his checks roll in. Sam Simon with Dogs rescued from a shelter that was not providing them with the care they needed - a venture he launched with PETA . This sweet annuity has bankrolled the causes and alternative lifestyle he increasingly came to embrace. Among his charitable efforts, he established the Sam Simon Foundation, which rescues dogs from animal shelters and trains them to assist disabled veterans and the hard-of-hearing. He donated an undisclosed amount of money to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in 2012 to purchase a vessel for their fleet, which was unveiled last December and named for him. In March, 2012, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' Norfolk, Va., headquarters were christened the Sam Simon Center in recognition of his support for that organization. Simon's largesse carries over to humans, too, including a Los Angeles food bank feeding 200 families each day in Simon style: with a vegan menu.","Sam Simon, 59, was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer in 2012 .

"The Masters World Championships Highland Games will take place in Inverness in September and preparations have long been under way for one of the key events: caber tossing. The Games' organisers have enlisted the help of Danny, an adorable three-year-old Clydesdale horse, who has an integral role to play in the upcoming caber tossing record-breaking attempt. For the chop: A tree is felled to make one of the cabers that will be used in the record breaking attempt . Danny has been working hard, pulling fallen trees from the Revack Estate in the Scottish Highlands, so that they can be carved into cabers. All cabers have to meet the regulation length of 14 foot 9 inches and weight of 55 pounds. Danny and his team will also ensure that the Highland Games Committee have enough cabers to attempt the Guinness Record Breaking attempt. Only 51 simultaneous tosses are needed for the record to be broken but over 100 have so far been carved. Danny then pulls the pieces of wood that will be used during this year's Highland Games to a piling point . The trunks of wood will be carved into cabers of regulation size and weight for the tossing competition . Scotland will see over 100 international competitors during this year's 150th anniversary Games. The caber-tossing event will take place at the Northern Meeting Park in Inverness on Sunday 14 September. Danny's 'guardian', Dave Garman, who helps run the Revack Estate said: 'We need to successfully turn 50 cabers to break the world record. It would be nice to get 150 to mark the 150th anniversary of the Northern Meeting Park - the oldest Highland Games venue in the world – but I can see no reason why we cannot aim for 200. 'Danny and I will be working flat out to prepare as many cabers as the Inverness Highland Games Committee needs to create this world record. It will be a momentous occasion.' Over 100 competitors from around the globe will attempt to break the caber toss Guinness Record .","The three-year-old horse is integral to caber tossing preparation .

"Following a relatively lukewarm reception to its latest handsets, and reports that the larger iPhone 6 Plus bends when stored in a back pocket, Apple has now been forced to pull its latest software update. Users began reporting overnight that the upgrade to iOS 8.0.1 robbed them of signal, data service and the Touch ID capability. This is the second major issue to arise with Apple's newest iPhone since it was launched on Friday - making it the most troubled new product release since the iPhone 4 and 'antennagate.' Scroll down for video . Brand new and already broken: Apple iOS 8.0.1, which was released today, cut cell and data service to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models (pictured) when installed . However, the company acted quickly to pull iOS 8.0.1 from the Apple store when users began reporting the problems within minutes of its release. The glitch appears to affect only the newest iPhones - not iPhone 5C or 5S, or older models. Apple users on networks across the US, Britain and Canada were reporting problems via Twitter and official support forums after updating their operating systems,MacRumors.com reported. Apple’s iOS 8.0.1 was designed to fix a number of glitches with the iOS 8 software. These included a bug that meant the release of HealthKit apps were delayed, an issue with third-party keyboards, a bug that stopped some apps accessing the photo library, reliability and usability of Apple's Reachability feature, an issue where ringtones were not being restored following iCloud backups, and a problem that could cause ‘unexpected cellular data usage when receiving SMS/MMS messages.’ For many, the update solved many of these issues, but in exchange, caused the TouchID fingerprint scanner to fail, as well as create the loss of data services on networks across the US, UK and Canada. The bug appears to only be affecting the newest iPhones. To restore a phone to a previous version of the software, as an alternative to waiting for Apple's next update, follow these steps, taken from Apple's support pages. 1. Make sure that you're using the latest version of iTunes. 2. Connect your iPhone to iTunes, using the Lightning cable. 3. Back up your iPhone in iTunes on your Mac or PC. iCloud backups won't restore to earlier versions, including iOS 8.0. 4. Download the relevant files for the device that is affected - the iPhone 6 or the iPhone 6 Plus. 5. Select the file by either pressing the Option key and click Check for Update, if using a Mac, or the Shift key and click Check for Update on a PC. 6. Press Update to install iOS 8 on your iPhone. The Health app won't work in iOS 8 after these steps. It will be fixed in Apple's upcoming iOS 8.0.2 software update. People who have only downloaded the update but not installed it yet, there is a way to delete it from the device. 1. Go to Settings, General, Usage and Manage Storage. 2. Select iOS 8.0.1 . 3. Tap Delete Update, and tap Delete Update again to confirm. Apple announced it was investigating the glitch, but in the meantime recommended that owners of affected iPhones restore their devices by connecting to iTunes. In an official statement, the tech giant said: 'We apologise for the great inconvenience experienced by users, and are working around the clock to prepare iOS 8.0.2 with a fix for the issue.' Angry users took to Twitter to report the bug and vent their frustrations. One user wrote: 'iOS 8.0.1 has broken my phone! No service and no touchid. #apple #Help #iOS8 #ios8bugs.' 'I would call Apple for an answer on this issue. But hang on I can't. NO SERVICE!!!' another said. New iPhone 6 users revealed that their phones bent after just a few hours in a pocket. Apple has refused to comment on the issue . This weekend, some iPhone 6 Plus users reported that their devices bent after just a few hours in their pockets. Apple has declined to comment on this particular issue. This is not the first time Apple's phones have been dogged by faults. Shortly after the iPhone 4 launched in 2012, customers struggled to get signal when the phone was held on the lower left edge of the frame. Apple issued a statement advising customers should 'avoid gripping [the phone] in the lower left corner' when making or receiving a call, which was met with even more complaints. The firm later released a software update to fix the problem, as well as offering customers free cases that Steve Jobs said at the time would also solve the issue. A small number of owners even sued the firm, and received $15 (£9) settlement checks. The iPhone 4S was then dogged with battery problems, and some users reported issues with a yellow tint on the display. It is believed the thinner model, in addition to the use of aluminium metal in its design, causes the phone to deform. A video, uploaded to YouTube by user Lewis Hilsenteger on his channel Unbox Therapy, shows the 5.5-inch model bending using just his fingers. It has already achieved more than 18.5 million views. Mr Hilsenteger has since released a follow up, in which he put Apple's main rival's handsets through the same 'bend' test. The Moto X was the most durable, the Nokia Lumia 1020 cracked but didn't bend, and the screen of the HTC One popped out. And even BlackBerry - a company that is lagging seriously behind Apple and Samsung in terms of marketshare - made reference to Apple's woes. During the launch event for its latest square Passport device, chief executive John Chen said: 'I would challenge you guys to bend our Passport.'

"Scientists have developed a promising treatment for prostate cancer by starving tumours of their blood supply. British researchers say the new approach could be tested in patients within two years, potentially giving them the ability to stop cancers growing and spreading. The scientists made the breakthrough after discovered a molecule which plays a key role in aggressive prostate cancer. Crucially, the academics from Bristol and Nottingham universities have already worked out how to neutralise the dangerous molecule. The new approach could be tested in patients within two years, potentially giving them the ability to stop cancers growing and spreading. The prostate is pictured in orange, containing a small tumour . The treatment, delivered by an injection, has already been shown to halt the growth of prostate tumours in mice. And scientists are confident the procedure can be replicated in humans, with a British firm investigating how to turn it into a clinical treatment. The findings, published yesterday in the Oncogene medical journal, rests on the investigation of a molecule called SRPK1. The scientists found that the molecule enables the tumour to form new blood vessels. Tumours need a supply of nutrient-enriched blood to survive, grow and spread. Stopping the production of new blood vessels prevents cancer cells from multiplying, they found. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, accounting for a quarter of all male cancers. Twenty per cent of patients die within five years of receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis, with few treatments available to doctors. Shrinking tumours by cutting off blood supply is an approach that has already been shown to work in colorectal cancer - but until now scientists had struggled to find a way to do the same thing in prostate tumour. The study leaders are now investigating whether the same molecular target will work in other tumours - with potential that the drug could be used to treat a range of diseases. The NHS is still failing to deliver the best diagnosis and treatment to thousands of men with prostate cancer, says the first national audit of services. It shows a ‘worryingly vast variation’ in access to advanced MRI scanning and the latest radiotherapy techniques. Half of all men with the disease do not receive all the support services they should in hospitals, the National Prostate Cancer Audit found. Four out of five radiation centres in England do not offer brachytherapy – which uses radioactive seeds planted inside the prostate and can help half of men retain their sex lives. The service is not provided at a single centre in Labour-run Wales. Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men. In the UK, more than 41,000 are diagnosed each year leading to around 10,000 deaths annually. Survival rates in the UK are below the European average and research into the disease lags a decade behind that for other cancers, say critics. The scientists made the discovery by analysing samples of human prostate cancer, observing that SRPK1 increases as the cancer got more aggressive. In experiments on mice, they found that injecting an inhibitor drug called Sphinx three times a week, stopped the molecule from working and the tumour growth halted. Study author Dr Sebastian Oltean, of Bristol University, said: ‘We reasoned that inhibition of SRPK1 activity could stop cancer progression. ‘Indeed, we show in this paper that if we decrease SRPK1 levels in prostate cancer cells, or in tumours grafted into mice, we are able to inhibit tumour vasculature and growth.’ He said: ‘This is a completely new area and could form a completely new class of drugs. Tumours all need blood to survive and grow, to differing degrees depending on the type. ‘If this is show to work in clinical trials it could be used to inhibit all kinds of cancers.’ Biotech company Exonate, a spin-out drug development firm from the University of Nottingham, is looking at developing SRPK1 inhibitors as treatments for other diseases with abnormal vessel development. They think sight problems where blood vessel development is key - such as age-related macular de-generation - could also benefit from the same approach. Study co-author Professor David Bates, from Nottingham, said: ‘Our results point to a novel way of treating prostate cancer patients and may have wider implications to be used in several types of cancers.’ Dr Matthew Hobbs, deputy director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, which helped fund the study, said: ‘There’s no denying that there are too few treatment options for the 40,000 men that face a diagnosis of prostate cancer every year in the UK – especially for those with advanced disease. ‘Prostate cancer continues to kill over 10,000 men annually and there is an urgent need for new treatments if we are to significantly reduce this figure. The treatment, delivered by an injection, has already been shown to halt the growth of prostate tumours in mice . ‘Although it’s early days, each finding like this represents a crucial block in building up our understanding of what can slow down and stop the progression of prostate cancer. This understanding will give us the foundations needed to develop new targeted treatments for those men in desperate need.’ The lack of treatments for men with prostate cancer is exacerbated by the fact the NHS is not using all those available to them, a report on cancer services revealed yesterday. The National Prostate Cancer Audit showed a ‘worryingly vast variation’ in access to advanced MRI scanning and the latest radiotherapy techniques. Half of all men with the disease do not receive all the support services they should in NHS hospitals, . And four out of five radiation centres in England do not offer brachytherapy – which uses radioactive seeds planted inside the prostate and can help half of men retain their sex lives after treatment.
