Naked models are turned into works of art by a painter who spends hours blending their bodies into urban street scenes. Trina Merry, 33, uses body paint to camouflage the women against graffiti and murals on walls and buildings. The invisible artwork regularly catches passers-by off guard, who fail to notice the people hiding behind the paint as she painstakingly copies every detail onto the model. Scroll down for video . Camouflaged: Artist Trina Merry painstakingly uses body paint to disguise models against graffiti . Disguised: The artist takes inspiration from the murals and tags around her native San Francisco . Intricate: It can take Trina up to eight hours to a complete a complex camo painting . Each of the artist's pieces take up to eight hours to create and can often never be reproduced as graffiti work is constantly removed from streets. Trina's range of work sees her mask a number of models into portraits, urban tags or abstract pieces. Trina, from San Francisco, California, said: 'My work started when I was essentially asked to get on stage at a rock concert in my underwear and get body painted - that was my first exposure to body paint. 'And I have been working on them ever since. 'I was working with urban art as a visual artist and wanted to keep making work with my friends when I transitioned to body paint as my medium, so I started doing these camouflage collaborations.

An old man dying of lung cancer and Parkinson’s disease was touched in his final months by an online campaign organized by his family, which generated more than 3,500 responses from people in over 100 countries. Brian Curtis, who lived in the remote Nebraska town of Harvard, found out that he had terminal lung cancer in April 2012, when doctors told him that he had six months to live – ‘plus or minus three months.’ The news of his father’s terminal illness had a major impact on son Brandon Curtis, 30, who works as international digital brand manager at Red Bull. Father and son: After Brian Curtis was diagnosed with lung cancer his son Brandon organized a touching online campaign to bring his father some happiness in his final days . He, along with the rest of the family, was still reeling from the unexpected loss of oldest sister Jana who had died from an undetected heart virus just eight months prior. ‘None of us had the chance to say goodbye,’ Brandon told Mashable. ‘When we found out about my dad's terminal cancer, we were going to do anything it took to show him how much we loved him and to say goodbye.’ Brandon and family decide to launch #SkyBluePink, an online campaign they hoped would help bring some happiness to their father in his final days. The campaign was named after Brian's favorite color - one that his mom had used to describe the color of the sky at sunrise and dusk. Brian Curtis waves from his bed in his hospice room covered with more than 3,500 #SkyBluePink cards, paintings, photos and even elementary school art projects from 105 countries . ‘We ask you to help fill his life with love, support and #SkyBluePink’ by sending a card, tweeting a note on Twitter or sharing a photo on Instagram, read a message posted by Brandon to announce their heart-warming project. Friends and family spread the word about the project via their social media channels. Soon strangers from more than 100 . countries had sent in images via social media or snail mail to comfort . this man they had never meet. A week after the launch, Brandon told his father about the project and how they had received 500 submissions in just 168 hours. 'It was enough to cover an entire wall at his hospice care center,' said Brandon. He recalls . his father ‘crying with pride and disbelief' as family members would . read Brian messages he had received from far flung locations such as . Germany and Australia.

A week after the launch, Brandon told his father about the project and how they had received 500 submissions in just 168 hours . As the months passed, Brian underwent . radiation to combat tumors that were spreading through his ribs, . shoulders, lymph nodes, lungs and spine. By Christmas, the family had received 2,700 #SkyBluePink submissions and photographs showed Brian lying in his hospice bed surrounded by shades of blue and pink, emanating from wall-mounted photos, paintings, messages and cards. He requested that Brandon share his message online: 'It's just amazing. I can’t get over how so many people have taken time out of their days to capture and send SkyBluePink to me. From all over. All ages ... People I've never met.' Then on August 12, Brandon received the call he had been dreading from his sister Cindy. His father didn’t have long left and he rushed to Nebraska from his home in Los Angeles in the hope of seeing his father and speaking to him one more time. By now his room was covered with more than 3,500 #SkyBluePink cards, paintings, photos and even elementary school art projects from 105 countries. Brandon got to sit with his father one last time and hold his hand, before Brian passed away hours later on August 13. The news of his father¿s terminal illness had a major impact on son Brandon Curtis, 30, who works as international digital brand manager at Red Bull . Later in the day, Brandon posted a message on Facebook to break the sad news and offer thanks to the #SkyBluePink community. ‘Dad passed away this afternoon. He was comfortable, happy, courageous. Our family wanted to thank you all so very much for taking the time to help us give him a proper #SkyBluePink send off today. 'As we looked around the world, because of you. This means more than you will ever know. We love you dad. You are amazing,' he wrote. A month later at a memorial service for their father on Sept. 14 memorial service, Brandon spoke about  #SkyBluePink and what it had meant to his father. 'I really think [#SkyBluePink] did play a role in him beating the doctor's expectations,' said Brandon. 'Sky Blue Pink' will always mean love.' The success of #SkyBluePink is a striking reminder - despite what people say about technology and social media making us less personal - that people still care and social platforms have the potential to bring the world together.

Hundreds have of women staged protests in West Bengal after an 11-year-old girl was soaked in kerosene and burned to death by men who tried to rape her. The youngster from Salkia in Howrah, near Kolkata in the eastern Indian state, died in hospital four days after neighbours found her in flames and screaming for help. In her last words she allegedly accused two men she recognised of setting her on fire after she threatened to tell her parents of their attempt to rape on her. Densely populated: People buy and sell flowers at the colourful Mullick Ghat Flower Market in Howrah, near to where an 11-year-old girl was allegedly burned to death by men after she resisted their rape attempt . Two local men, Kundan Mullick and Suraj Mullick, have been arrested in connection with the attempted rape and murder, Howrah police told the Times of India. The girl, whose name has not been released, was rushed to hospital last Wednesday after she was found by neighbours. Her landlady Sikha Mondal was among those who witnessed the grisly scene. Mrs Mondal said: 'The girl, before fainting on my hands, said when she had gone to the ground nearby to relieve herself, Kundan appeared from the bush, gagged her and tried to open her clothes. 'She then bit Kundan on his hands, pushed him back and tried to run away. Kundan then pushed her from behind, and when she stumbled and fell on the ground he threw some liquid on her and set her ablaze.' Since the girl was too ill to speak from her hospital bed, her last words to her landlady are being taken as her dying statement, police said. The girl's father had earlier told the Times Of India that Kundan, who was arrested on Saturday, had threatened his family after a 'scuffle' with his wife a few days before. He accused the suspect of trying to rape his daughter 'in revenge' and then setting her on fire after she recognised him and threatened to tell her parents everything. Neighbours who found the girl doused the flames and took her to the nearby Howrah State General Hospital. She was later taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital where she died of her injuries on Sunday. Doctors said she had suffered 70 per cent burns. Police said that during interrogations Kundan had denied setting the girl on fire and claimed it had been done by his friend Suraj. A police officer said that Suraj was arrested at his 'hideout' in the neighbourhood and that investigators had recovered the bottle they believe contained the kerosene. He said police were considering taking the duo back to the scene of the crime to reconstruct the events of the murder. Around 500 women from the area staged protests in front of the local police station, blocking roads and demanding that the suspects be hanged.","Unnamed youngster was set upon as she went to relieve herself .

The new Bank of England governor says he is ‘personally’ ready to head off the risks of a housing bubble caused by low interest rates and the Government’s Help to Buy scheme. In his first national newspaper interview since taking charge, Mark Carney tells the Daily Mail that he is alert to the ‘damage’ that could be caused by uncontrolled mortgage lending and surging house prices. The Canadian, who was a postgraduate student at Oxford University, says: ‘I lived in the country in the late ’80s, 1990s, I saw the boom-bust cycle in the housing sector, the damage it can do, the length of time it took to repair. I’m very alert personally to this issue.’ New Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said he is alert to the 'damage' uncontrolled mortgage lending and surging house prices could cause . Mr Carney said the Bank now has a 'toolkit' to restrict mortgage credit and even raise the amount of capital that banks and building societies must hold to restrain home loans . His comments come against the background of sharply recovering house prices. They climbed 4.6 per cent in the three months to July, the highest annual rate for more than three years. ‘We are watching it closely and we will as appropriate make our views known in terms of the degree of this risk and the potential action that should be taken to address it,’ he adds. Mr Carney says this could involve using the new powers of the Bank’s financial policy committee, which he chairs. In the past the Bank’s response to a potential housing bubble would have been to raise interest rates. The governor says it now has a ‘toolkit’ to restrict mortgage credit and even raise the amount of capital that banks and building societies must hold to restrain home loans. ‘We have the responsibility to assess emerging vulnerabilities in the economy such as housing, make those assessments and recommend action,’ he says. ‘Interest rates are principally an instrument of monetary policy for achieving the inflation outcome and there are other tools that address risks.’ His comments come against a great deal of scepticism about the extension of George Osborne’s Help to Buy scheme, which was unveiled in the Budget. Mark Carney's comments come against the background of sharply recovering house prices - they climbed 4.6 per cent in the three months to July, the highest annual rate for more than three years . Under that plan, designed to kick start house building, homebuyers will be able to access £135billion of mortgage subsidies from January 1 next year. Mr Carney recognises that heading off a credit or housing bubble, of the kind seen in the run-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis will be a ‘challenging task’. In what might be taken as a veiled warning to the Chancellor, he says even with new tools ‘it would be difficult to achieve if there were a host of government policies or other events that are pushing in the other direction’. In a wide ranging interview the governor, described by Mr Osborne as ‘the best central banker of his generation’, also puts some distance between the Bank and the Government over the future of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Delays and reviews by successive governments mean that RBS is still 80 per cent government-owned and its future is uncertain with MPs demanding a split between the ‘good’ lending side of the bank and its ‘bad’ largely investment banking arm. Mr Carney also put some distance between the Bank and the Government over the future of the Royal Bank of Scotland . ‘It is absolutely imperative that the uncertainty around RBS is dissipated, absolutely imperative,’ he says. The Bank chief says that if Britain’s economic performance is to be improved ‘there has to be an increase in bank lending to new business with good ideas or existing businesses that have a good expansion plan’. That is why the Bank is seeking to free up £90billion in new lending by easing the requirements on the amounts of cash banks must hold. Turning to savers, Mr Carney says that keeping interest low and bringing unemployment down to 7 per cent by 2016 – the Bank’s target – is important to them too, despite low returns. The sooner the economy is restored to growth and unemployment is brought down ‘the sooner there is normalisation of interest rates and savers will earn a return,’ he adds.","Mark Carney said he is alert to the 'damage' that could be caused .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:20 EST, 27 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:23 EST, 27 October 2013 . More than a year after a routine steroid injection turned into a painful fungal infection that nearly killed her, Marjorie Norwood is still suffering physically and emotionally. She also carries a huge stress: the hospital that houses the clinic where she contracted the meningitis infection has billed more than half a million dollars for her treatment. Norwood argues that she should not have to pay Saint Thomas West Hospital for the months of painful treatment and expensive medicines that fought the infection but did not restore her health. ‘They made me sick, and they made me come to their hospital to take care of me. And it was their fault that I was there,’ she said during a recent interview. ‘I shouldn’t have had to pay a cent, not a dime.’ Suffering: Marjorie Norwood, left, shown with her daughter, Melanie Norwood, contracted the rare fungal meningitis through a contaminated injection at the hospital . In some ways, Norwood is lucky. The same mold-contaminated medicine that was injected into her back killed 64 people around the country. She was one of 750 who were sickened, and her struggle provides a window into the challenges survivors can face while trying to resume their lives. The 60-year-old says the disease left her with permanent nerve damage. Despite months of therapy, Norwood sometimes slurs her speech. She has a hard time opening things. She can be clumsy. She can’t put her hand behind her head. She sometimes doesn’t remember recent conversations with her daughter. Like many of the victims, Norwood is suing the hospital, the clinic and the New England-based pharmacy that provided the medication. In court: Melanie Norwood, Majorie's daughter, in court last year with her attorney, Mark Chalos, right, after her mother became sick with fungal meningitis through a steroid shot at a hospital . She hopes a jury will award her enough damages to at least pay her medical bills. Tennessee law caps non-economic damages, such as for pain and suffering, at $750,000. Punitive damages cannot be more than twice the award for economic and emotional damages. Norwood is challenging those caps in her lawsuit. No trial date has yet been set. Saint Thomas West spokeswoman Rebecca . Climer said in an email response to questions that the hospital is . following its normal billing practices and that ‘legal and contractual . issues in the Medicare program and in private insurance contracts . restrict a provider’s ability to deviate’ from those practices. Of . the 153 people sickened in Tennessee, one of the hardest hit states . during the fall 2012 outbreak, 113 got the tainted steroid injections at . the Saint Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgical Center. The . Norwoods have health insurance through her husband’s job, but they are . not sure how much of the more than $500,000 worth of bills it will . cover. Dangerous infection: Norwood came to the Saint Thomas West Hospital in Tennessee to have a steroid injection for a back injury but instead ended up having to pay $500,000 in hospital bills after almost dying from the infection . Her medications alone cost between $400 and $600 a day at one point, and her treatment is ongoing, so the bills continue to accumulate. ‘Our savings is gone. We have no savings, no retirement. Everything we’ve got is gone,’ Norwood said. Norwood’s attorney, Mark Chalos, said several other victims he represents are also facing large hospital bills. Her daughter Melanie says the worst part is not the money, but what was permanently taken from her mother — her physical abilities and the self-confidence that comes with being independent. ‘She wanted to be able to goof around with her grandkids, but now they have to be careful around her because they don’t know if they’re going to hurt her,’ Melanie Norwood said. ‘It takes a lot of energy out of her just to do normal daily tasks, even to feed the dog.’ Norwood underwent back surgery for a bulging disk in 2003. She re-injured her back cutting the grass in the summer of 2012 and went in for a steroid injection at Saint Thomas. She had previous shots that usually brought relief. Dealing with the aftermath: Daughter Melanie says the worst part is not the money, but that her mother's physical abilities, self-confidence and independence were taken from her . Cost of treatment: Marjorie's medications alone cost between $400 and $600 a day at one point, and her treatment is ongoing, so the bills continue to accumulate, according to her daughter, Melanie, pictured left with lawyer . A fight for her life: Meningitis victim Marjorie Norwood of Nashville, Tennessee, says her savings are gone after the hospital billed her for curing the fungal infection they gave her . After this injection, however, she started having fevers and aches. Some days later, Norwood got a call from the hospital, and went in that same afternoon. She wouldn’t leave for almost two months. Her husband Jerry, an auto worker who had taken a job in Michigan, had to take an extended leave to stay by her side. Norwood lost more than 20 pounds, becoming weak and lethargic. She couldn’t see for a while. Her hair started falling out. She hallucinated, at one point biting an IV line in half. After Norwood left the hospital, she . spent two months in a nursing home. Even after she was allowed to go . home, she continued to need therapy. But her husband could not stay any . longer. He had to return to work. When the hospital bills and collection notices started coming, Norwood would discuss the situation with her daughter. ‘I’d start crying and she’d say, “Now calm down. It’s not as bad as you think it is”,’ recalled Norwood. ‘But it was as bad.’ She and her husband cashed in the 401k she had from her job at a lawnmower factory, before her injury. They also spent a homeowner’s insurance check meant to repair hail damage to their house. ‘It . got to the point where we only had a few hundred dollars in the bank. We had to take out an equity loan on the house to cover the bills, and . that’s how we’ve been making it,’ she said. In Michigan, Norwood’s husband, 62, shares an apartment with a co-worker and tries to live frugally.‘He goes through the week on nothing but sandwiches,’ his wife said. Run out of money: For her birthday this year, Norwood's daughter took her to Dillard¿s department store, where she had never been just to try on hats. There was no money to buy a birthday present . Marjorie Norwood also tries to spend little. For her birthday this year, Norwood said her daughter took her to Dillard’s department store, where she had never been. ‘We tried on hats. I didn’t get a birthday present. We just went out to Dillard’s,’ she said. Fungal meningitis is extremely rare and occurs when a fungus, in this case a black mold, infects the lining of the spinal cord and brain. Most sickened in the 2012 outbreak were infected by a fungus that had never been observed as a cause of meningitis, making it difficult for doctors to know how long to prescribe a potent anti-fungal that can damage the liver and kidneys and have other harsh side effects. Doctors have warned many patients, including Norwood, to be aware of any relapse symptoms.","Marjorie Norwood, 60, was one of 750 people who got the mold-contaminated steroid injection in 2012 .

The Prime Minister attacked the ‘snobbery’ of those who denigrate qualifications such as golf course management and music studies. He said that, in fact, these courses could lead to decent jobs - and were therefore just as valuable as many of the more academic subjects offered by colleges. Aiming for the future: Prime Minister David Cameron with apprentices Natalie Murray and Luke Pearce at the Mini Plant Oxford where he told an audience that the nation needed more young people with vocational qualifications . Mr Cameron, who never used the term Mickey Mouse degrees, made his comments at an event celebrating apprenticeships in Oxfordshire. He said that, too often in the past, Britain has pushed students into university when what the country needed was more people with vocational qualifications. The Prime Minister praised Germany, which does much more to ensure that people get the type of education suitable for them. Speaking at a Mini plant, he said: ‘For many years there’s been a snobbery in this country about some degrees. Investment: Cameron argued that the introduction of tuition fees meant students were now much more picky about which courses they go on - because they have to contribute more towards them . ‘They were called music studies or golf course management and people thought there must be something wrong with these degrees. ‘Frankly we’re now going to find out which degrees really benefit people. It will get rid of that snobbery.’ Mr Cameron said the introduction of tuition fees meant students were now much more picky about which courses they go on - because they have to contribute more towards them. This means students weigh up which courses will benefit them in the long run - meaning that only the best will survive. Courses such as golf course management could turn out to be the ones most likely to land people a good career, he said. ‘Because there are some students who make a bigger contribution on fees, I think quite rightly students are more fussy what it is they’re putting themselves in for,’ Mr Cameron said. ‘They’re saying before I sign up for this degree I want to know how many lectures I’m going to get, what quality teaching I’m going to receive, and whether this degree will help me get a good job. ‘That’s a very good thing. “Where does this leave me in terms of a qualification that will help me to get work?”.’","He said that too often in the past, Britain pushed students into university when the country needed more people with vocational qualifications .

Nicholas Overton, 35, who committed a string of robberies after escaping from a prison work placement, has been jailed for six years today . An escaped convict who went on a four-week crime spree after he was released from prison to go for 'work experience' was jailed for six years today. Nicholas Overton, 35, stole from at least three shops over the course of 28 days after taking £1,500 from a photo printing business he was supposed to be working for. Overton, originally from Sheffield, South Yorks, had been jailed for 18 years in 2006 for a string of gunpoint robberies across five counties. When he was last in court a judge told him he would have to serve eight years before being considered for parole, but in August, seven years into his term, Overton was allowed out of HMP Thorn Cross, Cheshire, to complete a work placement. After working the day shift at Max Spielman, in Chester, Overton disappeared and then went on a robbery spree across two counties. On September 12, at a Co-Op near Crewe, Overton walked into the store and pretended to be buying a pint of milk . However, when he got to the till he pulled out a 6in blade and leaned over to take money from behind the counter. The . shop assistant fought back and . during a struggle Overton’s watch fell off and landed in the cash drawer. Police matched DNA left on it to files they held on the criminal. A . blue green Audi A6 was also seen in the area at the time and it was later found at . a flat where Overton was staying. After . the case Det Insp Robert Hassall of Cheshire Police said: 'Our initial . thoughts were that the robberies weren’t connected. 'Knifepoint robberies tend to be localised and these were happening in two different towns and in a different county. 'As . the investigation progressed, the method of crime, clothing and further . enquiries led officers to believe they were in fact connected. 'A lot of work went into identifying how they could be linked, in order to gather enough evidence to get a breakthrough. This Co-Op store in Thornton Square, Macclesfield, is thought to be one of the shops raided by Overton . 'There . is a lot of work that goes on in the background in complicated . investigations such as this, which the public don’t get to see. Now we . are seeing a dangerous man back behind bars.' The fugitive was eventually captured by armed police in a dawn raid on a house in Crewe. After pleading guilty to three robberies at Chester Crown Court, Overton also asked for seven other robberies, one burglary, two thefts from motor vehicles and an attempted theft of £7,000 to be taken into consideration. Overton was originally branded a 'significant risk' to the public when he received an 18-year sentence at Sheffield Crown Court for 23 gunpoint robberies carried out on shops over two-months. He and an accomplice were said to have got a 'sick thrill' from their crimes. Though total haul from all the crimes was just £8,500, several victims, who thought they were going to be shot, were too afraid to return to work. The men were caught after their getaway car was spotted in Sheffield. South Yorkshire Police described their crime spree as a 'particularly protracted and worrying series of armed robberies.' Before his most recent spree Overton was at the 321 inmate Thorn Cross open jail, where prison accommodation consists of single rooms, with each prisoner having his own room key. He was allowed out on August 23 to work at a Max Spielman’s branch in Chester as part of the jail’s partnership with national and local employers. He was due back at the jail that night after a day working at the shop but the alarm was raised when he failed to report back to prison staff.","Nicholas Overton, 35, was on day release from prison when he escaped .

Parents who lose children in tragic accidents may be able to clone replacements within the next 50 years, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist has claimed . Sir John Gurdon, the British scientist whose work cloning frogs in the 1950s and 60s led to the creation of Dolly the sheep by Edinburgh scientists in 1996, said human cloning could happen within half a century. The biologist who won this year’s Nobel prize thinks that while any attempt to clone a human would raise complex ethical issues, people would soon overcome their concerns if the technique became medically useful. Dolly the Sheep was the first of several mammals to be cloned, including Cc the kitten . He explained that in-vitro fertilisation was regarded with considerable suspicion when it was first developed but became widely accepted after the birth of Louise Brown, the first ‘test tube baby’, in 1978. However, the vast majority of animal embryos cloned today are deformed so major improvements in cloning methods would have to be made, he added. Speaking on BBC Radio Four’s The Life Scientific, the biologist said he had predicted at the time of his frog experiments that the successful cloning of a mammal would happen within 50 years, and that and that the same answer could be applied to human cloning today. He said: ‘When my first frog . experiments were done an eminent American reporter came down and said . “How long will it be before these things can be done in mammals or . humans?” ‘I said: “Well, it . could be anywhere between 10 years and 100 years – how about 50 years?” It turned out that wasn’t far off the mark as far as Dolly was . concerned. Maybe the same answer is appropriate.’ Sir John Gurdon, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in October, says human cloning could happen within 50 years . The . 79-year-old former Etonian added that cloning a human effectively means . making an identical twin, and doctors would therefore simply be . ‘copying what nature has already produced’. ‘I take the view that anything you can do to relieve suffering or improve human health will usually be widely accepted by the public – that is to say if cloning actually turned out to be solving some problems and was useful to people, I think it would be accepted,’ he said. During his public lectures - which include speeches at Oxford and Cambridge Universities - he often asks his audience if they would be in favour of allowing parents of deceased children, who are no longer fertile, to create another using the mother’s eggs and skin cells from the first child, assuming the technique was safe and effective. ‘The average vote on that is 60 per cent in favour,’ he said. ‘The reasons for “no” are usually that the new child would feel they were some sort of a replacement for something and not valid in their own right. ‘But if the mother and father, if relevant, want to follow that route, why should you or I stop them?’ Almost 35 years ago, ethical questions were raised over test-tube babies, but since the birth of Louise Brown in 1978 the process of in vitro fertilisation has become commonplace, and is used by thousands of infertile couples around the world.

Tesco is charging food companies thousands of pounds a year to ensure their products appear at eye level on its shelves. A leaked memo has lifted the lid on a ploy believed to be used by most supermarkets to boost their profits at the expense of their suppliers. In effect, Tesco and other retailers are charging food and household products companies for the right to sell their brands through their branches. Food companies prepared to pay a premium sum will get products placed on the shelves at eye level in Tesco . Only those prepared to pay a premium figure will get their products placed on the shelves at eye level, where research shows they are more likely to be seen and purchased. However, the net effect of the tactic is that shoppers end up paying more for big-brand items. A memo compiled by Tesco’s cooking ingredients buying manager, James Marshall, and sent to suppliers was leaked to The Grocer magazine by an angry supplier. The memo explained that suppliers would be expected to pay £30 a product per store for lines to be stocked on two key eye-level shelves. Consequently, a company wanting its products on these shelves at 600 Tesco stores for a full year could be charged £18,000. There was a charge of £15 for products to be stacked on the top shelf or those at waist level, while there was no payment for the bottom shelf. The Tesco email also included a diagram to highlight the benefits of being on the ‘hottest’ shelf. The shelves at eye level were coloured in red and featured images of the sun wearing sunglasses, while the bottom shelf was blue and included pictures of igloos. While the system is a clear money-spinner for Tesco, it also helps large, well-off brands, which can afford such payments, at the expense of small independent food producers . While the system is a clear money-spinner for Tesco, it also helps large, well-off brands, which can afford such payments, at the expense of small independent food producers. There has been controversy in the past about how supermarkets  have required manufacturers and farmers to fund special discount promotions by accepting lower prices for their products. This has allowed the stores to present themselves as the shopper’s friend without having to suffer any cut in their profit margin. Tesco insisted that charging suppliers more to put their products on eye-level shelves was not new and common practice among major retailers. However, one supplier who received the email described it as a new tactic.He said: ‘Tesco are making it increasingly unattractive to do business with them. We won’t support this. ‘And as a leading brand, if we are then positioned on the bottom shelf, how is that serving the needs of the Tesco customer?’ The row is the latest evidence of an increasingly difficult relationship between Britain’s biggest supermarket, which has huge power to make or break brands, and manufacturers. Tesco recently took 70 big brands made by the Princes company off its shelves, including Princes meat pies, Crosse & Blackwell soups and Napolina oils. Neither company would explain why the two had fallen out. However, rival suppliers suggested the dispute may have been over payments demanded by Tesco. A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We work closely with our suppliers to build exciting ranges for our customers, and make our ranging decisions based primarily on what we think will work best for customers. ‘Suppliers often request changes to where their products are placed on shelves, for example to give more prominence to a new product. This practice is common across the industry.’","Ploy used by most supermarkets to boost profits at expense of suppliers .

A set of bespoke golf clubs belonging to Lord Lucan have been found in the attic of a practice range where they were left days before he vanished. The gambling peer used to play and take golf lessons at the Knightsbridge Golf School. He attended his final class a day or two before his family nanny was murdered and he disappeared, never to be seen again. Discovered: Lord Lucan's golf clubs found at Knightsbridge Golf Club will be displayed as part of the relaunch . Mystery: The seventh Earl of Lucan disappeared on November 7, 1974, after his nanny was found dead . The nanny, Sandra Rivett, was beaten to . death by a drainpipe at his estranged wife's home in Belgravia, London, . on November 7, 1974. Reports claim Lady Lucan burst into the nearby Plumber’s Arms pub at 9.45 that night, . crying: 'Help me, help me, help me. I’ve just escaped from being . murdered. He’s in the house. He’s murdered the Nanny!' She later told her police her husband was the attacker who ambushed her, the nanny, and their three children. That . was the last recorded sighting of the peer, who was declared dead in . 1999, despite numerous supposed sightings of him all over the world. Now, . 39 years later, Scotland Yard detectives have announced they will look . again at Sandra Rivett's murder case after Lord Lucan's treasured collection of clubs were discovered during a refurbishment of the school. Fascinating: Philip Talbot, co-director (left), is amazed by the finding at the school - still a celebrity haunt today . According to co-director of the central London school, Steve Gould, the bag was left by Lady Lucan, who left a note asking for them to be sold in the week of the scandalous attack. Mr Gould said: 'Lady Lucan left the clubs here years ago - a few days before Lord Lucan went missing. 'We . had a letter from her asking if we could sell the clubs for her. She . left them here and we forgot all about them. In the refurbishment we . found them and it all came back. 'It was so long ago we can't remember . exactly what it said. It started with ""These are my husband's golf . clubs..."". 'We do not want to upset anyone at all so we will be very . careful about the way we treat the situation, but obviously it would be . very interesting to find the letter.' Scandal: It is reported Lady Lucan ran into a The Plumber's Arms pub distressed and screaming after the attack. His blook-soaked car was found days later. Here they couple are pictured with their son, George . The golf club was a major part of Lord Lucan's life, as he attended numerous times a week with friends. Golf coach David Wilkinson, 65, remembers the enigmatic figure coming in for morning lessons after a night of gambling. Starting as a golf pro and teacher at the school in 1970, he knew Lord Lucan for four years before he disappeared. Mr Wilkinson, who now runs the school and still teaches, told MailOnline: 'I met him in 1970 when I started working at the club. 'I was the guy that booked the people in so I saw him when he arrived and left every day. 'It was so long ago but he seemed a nice man to me. He was tall and charming. 'He was in the club the day before he disappeared and seemed to be exactly the same as he always was.' Aristocracy: The peer, born in 1934, has now been declared dead but people still report sightings of him . Mr Gould added: 'Lord Lucan has been described as having the strongest pair of hands of any member of aristocracy. He was an interesting man and a good golfer - these would have been good clubs. 'I wasn't there at the time but Dave [Wilkinson] has always said he was a very nice chap, very smart and nice-looking. 'When he went missing, the police came to interview Leslie King but he said he could not discuss any of his students.' The scandal that still plagues detectives today was one of the most talked-about mysteries of the time. Although Lord Lucan's car was found abandoned doused in blood in Newhaven, East Sussex, three days later, he was never found. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The inquiry into the death of Sandra Rivett is the subject of regular reviews, as is the case with all unsolved murders. It has never been closed. 'Any significant new information will be considered.'","Bespoke clubs found in Knightsbridge Golf School during refurbishment .

Dominique Strauss-Kahn was today embroiled in a fresh sex scandal, as claims emerged that he tried to assault an Italian television journalist in the late 1990s. Myrta Merlino was forced to fight off the former IMF chief in a hotel room in Davos, it is alleged. The allegations come just as the shamed economist begins to rehabilitate his damaged image. Strauss-Kahn allegedly tried to assault Italian journalist Myrta Merlino during an interview in the late 1990s . Strauss-Kahn, 64, has been hit by a catalogue of sex scandals since 2011 when he was accused of attempting to rape a hotel chambermaid in New York City. The charge was later dropped. According to the latest allegations, Miss Merlino, then a business correspondent, secured an interview with the then-French finance minister after he ‘noticed her’ during the World Economic Conference in the Swiss mountain resort. She said: ‘Strauss-Kahn’s press office explained to me that the minister had very important commitments with CNN, but he had noticed me and said he wanted to do the interview in spite of a difficult day.’ The French politician gave her an appointment at 8pm in the bar of his Davos hotel. But when she arrived, a message arrived on a silver plate telling her the minister was awaiting her in his suite. In an interview for a digital TV channel, Miss Merlino, 43, told political journalist Klaus Davi: ‘He told me to leave the cameraman outside while we discussed the interview. 'I went in a bit hesitantly and sat down in an armchair. He gave me a large glass of champagne and began taking about everything but the interview. She continued: ‘Then he shamelessly began an attempt to seduce me. 'He told me that he loved journalists. I told him that I thought his wife an amazing woman and a great journalist. ‘I got up and he pushed me violently against a wall and tried to kiss me. I gave him a powerful slap, I struggled and with difficulty got away.’ The young business reporter immediately fled the room but said she afterwards felt ‘very upset’ by the incident. She added: ‘It was not the physical . attack but the psychological violence of a man of power, because when an . important man of a certain age puts pressure as it was in my case at . the time, a young girl, it is a wrong thing and unpleasant.’ Miss Merlino did not report the incident because she had got away and did not want to become famous because of it, she said. Strauss-Kahn was pictured with his new girlfriend Myriam Aouffir at the Cannes Film Festival last month . Mr Strauss-Kahn, once tipped to be the next president of France, made a spectacular fall from grace in 2011 when he was arrested in New York accused of trying to rape chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo. Criminal charges were dropped after 18 months with the two parties agreeing an out of court settlement. Returning to France last year Mr Strauss Kahn faced new accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer. Again the case was dropped because the alleged attack happened more than a decade ago. He remains under formal investigation in France in a separate case in which sex workers were allegedly procured for orgies he attended around the world. Since his 20-year marriage to French journalist Anne Sinclair came to an end last year, Mr Strauss Kahn has been regularly seen with Moroccan-born TV press officer Myriam Aouffir, who is 20 years his junior.","Myrta Merlino claims assault occurred during hotel room interview .

Christopher Symons, 63, was jailed today for murdering his business partner Patricia Goodband, 76, and throwing her down a brick shaft to try to get a 1m inheritance . A policeman's father was jailed for 27 years today for brutally murdering a millionairess with a wrench before dumping her battered body in a disused 12ft well and covering it with soil from a cemetery. Christopher Symons battered wealthy 76-year-old Patricia Goodband to death and then devised a grand plan he dubbed, 'The 12 days of Xmas', in an attempt to inherit her fortune. In a scrawled note the 63-year-old listed daily tasks to try to cover up the grandmother-of-two's murder and throw detectives off the scent. The incriminating list was found in his car by detectives searching for clues over Mrs Goodband's murder and it was used as a vital piece of evidence in the case against him. Amazingly Symons' own son Ben works as a Police Constable for Thames Valley Police - the same force investigating the death. Symons mapped out his detailed plan and enlisted the help of his elderly lover and a grave digger friend to cover his tracks. Today he showed no emotion when he was told he would probably die in prison as he will serve a minimum term of 27 years meaning he would be aged 90 years before there was a chance of parole. Sentencing him at Reading Crown Court Judge Zoe Smith told Symons: 'This was a murder where the particulars of the offence were particularly high.' Describing further the particulars of the killing which involved a heavy wrench, she said: 'The substantial planning. The concealment of the body. The false trail after her murder. 'The deceit employed to convince Mrs Goodband's daughter that her mother was missing and the recruitment of others to sure up your cover story. 'I find that the purpose of the murder was to ensure that your entitlement to her savings and house remained intact.' Cunning: Detailed plans to murder Patricia Goodband and then detract police investigations away from him were found in Symons' car . Betrayed: Patricia Goodland was brutally murdered by her friend and business partner Christopher Symons just before Christmas last year . Symons' manipulated lover Jennifer Creasey, aged 73 years, was convicted of perverting the course of justice after making a false statement to police in a bid to protect him . She was sentenced to six months in jail. His accomplice, Robert Taft, 60, previously admitted to misleading police by claiming he had dropped Mrs Goodband off at a railway station and a separate charge of possession of ammunition without a licence. Police found 22 calibre bullets in a jacket pocket which Taft claimed Symons had given him. He too was jailed, but for only 10 months. Mrs Goodband, who ran a haulage business with Symons, was last seen alive three days before Christmas on Decmber 22 last year. The three-week trial had heard that Mrs Goodband was reported missing by her daughter Samantha McLoughlin, who lives in North Yorkshire, on January 9. Symons sent himself a series of texts from Mrs Goodband's phone in a bid to mislead police. He also got lover Creasey to write a fake Christmas card to Mrs Goodband and enlisted Taft’s help in fabricating the story that the divorcee had decided to travel north for the Christmas period. Following a painstaking investigation Mrs Goodband's body was found concealed in the deep well shaft in the garden of her home in the rural village of Woodham, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire on January 21 this year. She had been repeatedly beaten around the head before her body was thrown into the well. Symons, from Aylesbury, was found guilty of a single charge of murder by a jury after just over four hours of deliberations. Creasey, from Benson, Oxfordshire, was found guilty of one count of perverting the course of justice and Taft, also from Aylesbury, admitted the same charge.

SpaceX's prototype Grasshopper reusable rocket took a giant leap for commercial space flight last week when it rose 131ft and landed safely back on Earth. The latest launch by the private space travel company, which has already run resupply missions to the International Space Station, is a major step in their ambition to produce a reusable space vehicle. In its previous two flights the Grasshopper has managed to hover at six feet and 17ft before settling back down. Successful launch: SpaceX's prototype reusable Grasshopper rocket flew 131ft and hovered before safely settling back down on its launch pad . California-based SpaceX documented . last week's successful test launch at their test pad in McGregor, Texas, . in a YouTube video published last night. It was accompanied by a series of humorous tweets from the pioneering company's eccentric billionaire founder Elon Musk. 'To provide a little perspective on the size of Grasshopper, we added a 6ft cowboy to the rocket,' he wrote. Powered by a Falcon 9 rocket and Merlin 1D engine, the 10-storey-tall Grasshopper rocket is designed to take off and land vertically - part of SpaceX's plant to develop a rocket that can return to a launch pad for rapid reuse. It has four steel landing legs with hydraulic dampers and a steel support structure to keep it intact when it settles back down to terra firma. Vertical-takeoff space vehicles developed thus far rely on disposable lower stages, which adds millions of dollars to the cost of launching spacecraft into orbit. A new generation of reusable rockets that can launch, fly and land would dramatically slash the cost of travelling into space. In the 29-second test flight conducted December 17, the Grasshopper rocket rose to a height of 131ft - around ten storeys - and hovered before landing safely on its launch pad using closed loop thrust vector and throttle control. Mr Musk declared the launch a success, writing on Twitter: 'No problemo.' Perspective: The six-foot tall cowboy dummy that rode the Grasshopper rocket all the way - and survived unscathed . As well as the Grasshopper project, SpaceX has already achieved the accolade of becoming the first private company to launch a successful mission to the International Space Station. It's first launch of its unmanned Dragon capsule was in May, with a follow up mission to the ISS completed successfully in October. But Mr Musk's even more ambitious long-term goal is to establish a colony on Mars, and he has said that reusable rockets like the Grasshopper are 'the pivotal step' in achieving that.","Reusable rockets could slash the cost of commercial space travel .

Volcanic eruptions could be the source of large changes in the sulphur dioxide levels in the atmosphere of Venus, say scientists studying data from a satellite orbiting the world. Venus is covered in hundreds of volcanoes, but whether they remain active today is much debated, providing an important scientific goal for researchers studying the planet. The planet's thick atmosphere contains over a million times more sulphur dioxide as Earth's. On our own planet almost all the pungent, toxic gas is generated by volcanic activity. Scroll down for video . Heating up: An artist's impression of a volcano on Venus. New evidence from a satellite orbiting the planet suggests that its volcanoes may be active and could be the source of fluctuations in atmospheric sulphur dioxide . Most of the sulphur dioxide on Venus is hidden below the planet’s dense upper cloud deck, because the gas is readily destroyed by sunlight. That means any sulphur dioxide detected in Venus’ upper atmosphere above the cloud deck must have been recently supplied from below. The European Space Agency's Venus Express mission has already found clues pointing to volcanism on geologically recent timescales, within the last few hundreds of thousands to millions of years. Venus Express is a satellite optimised for studying the atmosphere of Venus, from the surface right up to the ionosphere. It has been successfully operating in orbit around Venus since April 2006. A previous analysis of infrared radiation from the surface pointed to lava flows atop a volcano with a composition distinct from those of their surroundings, suggesting that the volcano had erupted in the planet’s recent past. Now, an analysis of sulphur dioxide concentration in the upper atmosphere over six years provides another clue. Fluctuations: The rise and fall of sulphur dioxide in the upper atmosphere of Venus over the last 40 years, expressed in units of parts per billion by volume (ppbv) Immediately after arriving at Venus, the spacecraft recorded a significant increase in the average density of sulphur dioxide in the upper atmosphere, followed by a sharp decrease to values roughly ten times lower by today. A similar fall was also seen during NASA’s Pioneer Venus mission, which orbited the planet from 1978 to 1992. At that time, the preferred explanation was an earlier injection of sulphur dioxide from one or more volcanoes, with Pioneer Venus arriving in time for the decline. Investigation: Venus Express is a satellite optimised for studying the atmosphere of Venus, from the surface right up to the ionosphere. It has been successfully operating in orbit around Venus since April 2006 . Named for the Roman goddess of love and beauty, Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun and completes its orbit every 224.7 Earth days. After the Moon, it is the brightest natural object in the night sky, bright enough even to cast shadows on Earth. Venus reaches its maximum brightness shortly before sunrise or shortly after sunset, for which reason it has been referred to by ancient cultures as the Morning Star or Evening Star. The Ancient Greeks believed Venus to be two separate bodies, calling the morning star Phosphoros, the 'Bringer of Light', or Eosphoros, the 'Bringer of Dawn'. The evening star they called Hesperos, the 'star of the evening'. By Hellenistic times, they realized the two were the same planet, which they named after their goddess of love, Aphrodite. Hesperos would be translated into Latin as Vesper and Phosphoros as Lucifer ('Light Bearer'), a poetic term later used to refer to the fallen angel cast out of heaven. Venus has an extremely dense atmosphere, which consists mainly of carbon dioxide and a small amount of nitrogen. Pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times that at Earth's surface — a pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly 1km under the sea. The CO2-rich atmosphere, along with thick clouds of sulfur dioxide, generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the Solar System, creating surface temperatures of at least 462 °C . Dr Emmanuel Marcq of Laboratoire . Atmosphères, Milieux, Observations Spatiales, France, said: 'If you see a . sulphur dioxide increase in the upper atmosphere, you know that . something has brought it up recently, because individual molecules are . destroyed there by sunlight after just a couple of days.' Dr . Jean-Loup Bertaux, principal investigator for the instrument that made . the detections, added: 'A volcanic eruption could act like a piston to . blast sulphur dioxide up to these levels, but peculiarities in the . circulation of the planet that we don’t yet fully understand could also . mix the gas to reproduce the same result.' Venus has a ‘super-rotating’ atmosphere that whips around the planet in just four Earth-days, much faster than the 243 days the planet takes to complete one rotation about its axis. Such rapid atmospheric circulation spreads the sulphur dioxide around, making it difficult to isolate any individual points of origin for the gas. Dr Marcq’s team speculate that if volcanism was responsible for the initial increase, then it could come from a relatively gentle increased output of several active volcanoes rather than one dramatic eruption. 'Alternatively, and taking into account the similar trend observed by Pioneer Venus, it’s possible that we are seeing decadal-scale variability in the circulation of the atmosphere, which is turning out to be even more complex than we could ever have imagined,' he noted. 'By following clues left by trace gases in the atmosphere, we are uncovering the way Venus works, which could point us to the smoking gun of active volcanism,' added Håkan Svedhem, ESA’s Project Scientist for Venus Express.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:21 EST, 18 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:13 EST, 22 August 2013 . A retired FBI forensic artist has claimed that a long-time suspect in the murder of Etan Patz carried around a picture of the missing child as a teenager. Etan disappeared as he walked to a bus stop in New York City when he was six years old. Authorities believe he was abducted off . the street in SoHo in 1979 and later murdered. Gene O'Donnell, who worked for the FBI for 32 years, believes that Jose Ramos, a child-molesting drifter who has long been suspected of killing Patz, had a picture of Etan when he was a teenager. The artist is basing his claim on an age-progression sketch he did of Patz as a teenager which is eerily close to another picture of a teenage boy, seen wearing a T-shirt and jeans on a bus. Resemblance: a photo of a teenaged boy looks very similar to an age-progression sketch of Etan Patz, who disappeared when he was just 6 . 'In 1990, I believed Etan Patz was the young man in the photograph on . the bus. I have not changed my mind,' Mr O'Donnell told the New York Post. 'The fact that Ramos had the photograph in his pocket . is the thing that kind of threw me over the edge.' However, police sources told the Post that they are certain the young man in the photograph is not Etan Patz after they tracked him down, held interviews and even completed a DNA test. The case gets even more complicated after another man, Pedro Hernandez, confessed last year to strangling Patz in the basement of a SoHo bodega in 1979. A photograph of Patz as a teenager would reveal his confessions to be false. In 1990, Mr O'Donnell was asked by the NYPD to create a picture of Etan Patz showing the missing boy as a teenager. The forensic artist worked painstakingly to recreate an image from family photos. Later he was shown a Polaroid that had been taken by police from Ramos' pocket. He told MailOnline he is extremely interested to see any photographs taken of the teenager found by police, while they were holding interviews and tests. 'All I ever wanted to see was a photograph. If they got the right guy, he should match that boy on the bus,' Mr O'Donnell said. 'But I've never seen it.' Monster: Convicted child molester Jose Ramos was long-considered the prime suspect in Patz's disappearance . New leads: FBI agents tear up the floor of a SoHo basement after the Patz case was reopened . It's not clear whether any pictures of the teenager detectives tracked down were ever released to the public. Mr O'Donnell, who is writing a book about his part in the Patz case, said he was never contacted again regarding the missing boy after he submitted his age progression drawing. Ramos' connection to Patz is through one of the boy's babysitters, who was friends with Ramos. Shortly after Patz's disappearance, Ramos was convicted of multiple counts . of child molestation and served a 27-year prison sentence in . Pennsylvania. At the time of his arrest, authorities found dozens of photos in the drainpipe where Ramos had been living of young boys who all had a strong resemblance to Patz. While incarcerated, a jailhouse snitch told authorities . that Ramos had confessed to him that he knew what happened to Patz. However, it wasn't enough evidence for prosecutors to pursue charges. Despite . no criminal charges, the Patz family sued Ramos in civil court, where . he was found to have been responsible for the boy's death. The Patz family . was awarded a ceremonial $2million, which they never attempted to . collect. Confusion: Pedro Hernandez claims he killed Patz, but there is no evidence linking him to the crime . Ramos, 70, is currently in a Pennsylvania prison for failing to register as a sex offender after serving a 27-year prison sentence. The child molester has repeatedly denied involvement in Patz's disappearance. Patz's father Stanley told the Post that he was shown the photo but doesn't believe it is his son. Hernandez, who was arrested in May, 2012 - after Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance re-opened the Patz case - when family members told authorities that he admitted to killing Patz. At the time of Patz's disappearance, Hernandez worked in a bodega just blocks from the boy's home. Prosecutors may be forced to throw out the case against Hernandez - who is both schizophrenic and suffering from bipolar disorder - due to a lack of evidence.","Etan Patz was last seen in 1979 when he walked alone to the bus stop in Manhattan for the first time .

A father-of-two has built a career that children around the world can only dream of - making spectacular works of art out of Lego. Duncan Titmarsh, 42, gave up his stable job as a kitchen fitter five years ago to pursue his unique career. Now a professional, he is the only person in Britain to be officially recognised by the famous Danish toy company. Duncan Titmarsh gave up his stable job as a kitchen fitter five years ago to pursue his unique career as Britain's only professional Lego builder . Mr Titmarsh, 42, from Farnham, Surrey, has loved Lego since he first played with it as a child. In a huge warehouse in Bordon, Hampshire, he has a staggering six million pieces of Lego that he uses to carry out his day-to-day work. He set up and works for Bright Bricks, the UK’s only Lego-certified building company. He is currently building a Lego engine for a Rolls Royce and recreating the East Village from the London 2012 Olympics. The most prestigious project he has worked on was the huge 14ft, 400,000-piece Lego Christmas Tree in St Pancras station in 2011. He also creates large mosaics of pictures and has recreated famous work by artist, Banksy. Mr Titmarsh says that his friends and family thought he was mad when he decided to become a professional Lego builder but that he loves his job . In a huge warehouse in Hampshire, Mr Titmarsh has six million pieces of Lego with which he builds his models. As an official Lego builder, he gets the bricks at a discounted price . It takes Mr Titmarsh anything from two days to two weeks to complete his work. Since becoming a professional Lego maker in 2008 he has made more than 400 bespoke pieces of art using the blocks. He said: ‘Like most children I loved playing with Lego when I was younger, but I never thought it would be my job later in life. ‘Everyone loves Lego and I picked up my first set in Woolworths when I was just a little boy.

He said: ‘It was hard at first to make the change, and my family and close friends thought I was mad. ‘But I’m thrilled that I made the change when I did as it’s something that I enjoy doing every day.’ There are estimated to be just three or four people in the world who make a full-time living from building structures of the plastic bricks. He says that he loves the variety in his work and the fantastic reactions he gets from people when they see his creations . To mark 150 years of London Underground Mr Titmarsh has created a series of Lego London Underground maps showing how the Tube network has evolved over time. The image shows how the map will look in 2020 . Being a certified Lego builder allows Mr Titmarsh to buy bricks directly from the Danish company at a discount. He spends up to eight hours a day in the warehouse building a variety of designs. He said: ‘I love the variety in my work; you just don’t know what you’re going to be doing each day. ‘Each day is different and until people send in their photographs and designs - I don’t know what I’ll be working on. ‘I love to see the work when it’s finished and the recognition and response I receive from people is fantastic. ‘You could say that it’s every boy’s dream to play and work with Lego for the rest of their life - I love it.’","Duncan Titmarsh gave up his job as a kitchen fitter to work with Lego .

Graham Norton has attacked his BBC employers for handing out ‘sacks of cash’ to departing executives. The chat show host, who is himself one of the corporation’s highest-paid presenters, said the severance pay-off scandal ‘defies belief’ and had ‘dragged the BBC into disrepute’. But the 50-year-old entertainer also admitted that his own £2.6million pay packet was ‘very good’, and said he would be tempted to join rival channel ITV only if it offered him a ‘lorry-load of cash’. Norton has attacked his BBC employers for handing out 'sacks of cash' to departing executives . Earlier this year it emerged that the BBC had paid out £369million in golden goodbyes over eight years, including £60million to senior managers. Severance payments included £470,000 to former director general George Entwistle after only 54 days in the job and £680,000 to ex-chief operating officer Caroline Thomson. In an interview with Radio Times, Norton said: ‘They are scoring way too many own goals. There’s a new triumvirate, Charlotte [Moore] is in there [as controller of BBC1], Danny [Cohen] is now head of television and you’ve got [director-general] Tony Hall, and you hope we can start again and that those sort of mistakes won’t continue to be made. As well as presenting The Graham Norton Show on BBC1 on Fridays, he hosts a Saturday morning show on BBC Radio 2 . ‘Because it did seem extraordinary in a time of cuts where you were asking everyone who works for the BBC who’s loyal and doing a good job to tighten their belts and take a reduction in pay, while those people who’d dragged the BBC into disrepute were being handed sacks of cash. It defies belief.’ Last year it emerged that Norton had received £2.61million in ‘presenter fees, production fees and royalties’ from his production firm So Television, an increase of 20 per cent in a year. It is thought his BBC salary accounts for at least £1.5million of that income. As well as presenting The Graham Norton Show on BBC1 on Fridays, he hosts a Saturday morning show on BBC Radio 2. The star, who has homes in London, . New York and Sussex, said: ‘I can’t imagine what would make me [leave . the BBC]. Who’s to say? Because I don’t think I would work on ITV. So . the only reason I would go is if I was ready to retire and they had a . lorry-load of cash outside my door. Then I might.’ Norton . also spoke about a near-fatal stabbing he suffered while a drama . student. He was left for dead by a gang who stabbed him in the chest . while he was walking through Queen’s Park in North London and lost more . than half the blood in his body. Recalling . the incident, Norton said: ‘You don’t feel pain in that moment because . your adrenaline’s all pumping. That Shakespearean thing of, “Oh, I’ve . been run through” I always thought they said because they didn’t have . any special effects. But they say it because that’s what people say when . they’re run though. They look down and they see blood and they go, “Oh, .

A police marksman shot himself dead after rowing with his girlfriend who had cheated on him with a colleague, an inquest heard today. Colin Smelt, 43, blasted himself in the chest with his police issue Glock pistol he had taken home to his flat in Camden, north London, the hearing was told. The officer - a member of the elite Special Protection Command unit which protects VIPs including the Prime Minister and the Royal family - was found slumped against his chair in his Met police vest with the semi-automatic pistol by his side when officers forced entry into his home. Tormented: Armed policeman Colin Smelt, 43, had become suicidal after the failure of his relationship with lover Melissa Jordan, St Pancras Coroner's Court heard . St Pancras Coroner’s Court heard how emotionally fragile PC Smelt did not cope well when romantic relationships broke down - and had a history of threatening suicide. Yet despite this, he had access to weapons, and previously taken a gun home to practice killing himself, the inquest was told. And on the day before his death on February 18, this year, he had signed out a pistol from the police armory and taken it home to his flat in Camden, north London. That evening, PC Smelt had met with on-off girlfriend Melissa Jordan at his flat in Kings Terrace, to see if they could repair their troubled relationship. He had wanted to patch things up after learning she had twice cheated on him - once with a member of his police team, but the coroner heard that she wanted to remain friends, the coroner was told. Breaking into tears several times as . she gave evidence, Ms Jordan said the next morning she had arranged to . have dinner with him and said: 'I kissed him on the cheek and said . goodbye. 'We were texting all day and at 4pm that was the last I heard from him.' Asked what were in the text messages, she said: 'He said ""I love you very much"". 'He started to apologise to me as if he had done something wrong. I said ""but you haven’t don’t anything wrong"".' At 4pm she sent him a text asking if she should go over that night, but she never got a reply. Worried after she didn’t hear from him, she called some of his colleagues to ask them to check on him. However, Ms Jodan told the hearing that she never thought he would kill himself. She . said: 'I just didn’t want him taking his motorbike out and driving 300 . miles an hour - I wasn’t thinking he would take his life.' Tragic: PC Smelt used his police issue Glock 9mm pistol, similar to the one pictured, to shoot himself, his inquest was told (Stock picture) She said PC Smelt - a keen motorcyclist, skier and scuba diver - was 'outgoing' and had a 'real zest for life'. But . the inquest heard that he had tried to kill himself three times in one . night when he was 22 after he split up with a previous girlfriend. And . he had also rung his ex wife, Louise Richards, in floods of tears . threatening to kill himself when they were going through one of their . break-ups. In a statement . she said: 'He said he had his gun next to him and he was seriously . considering ending his life by shooting himself. 'I was so shocked, I told him not to be stupid, that I loved him and we would work something out. 'I told him to come home and we would be alright.' But she added: 'There was no chance he would concern his superiors and come home or ask for time off. 'Colin didn’t show emotions. He was a closed book.' PC Smelt 'compartmentalised' his emotions and rarely spoke about his failed suicide bids, the inquest heard. However, . in an email in January this year he confided in Ms Jordan, telling her . that he had tried to gas himself and take an overdose of pills when he . was 22. He also took a gun . from his police station and practised pulling the trigger unloaded, but . couldn’t bring himself to kill himself. Tragic: PC Smelt had been a member of the elite Special Protection Command police unit which protects VIPs including the Prime Minister and the Royal family. (Stock picture) She said: 'He told me dark thoughts that he had never told anyone. 'It was hard for me. He was dealing with a lot of emotions he had never dealt with before. He had just locked it away in a box. 'He said it had never gone that bad since because he said nothing in life is that important enough to kill yourself over. He said it was a selfish thing to do and he was too proud to do it.' His close friend Detective Sergeant Stephen Crumley said PC Smelt was upset by Ms Jordan cheating on him. In a statement he said: 'In October 2012 he came to see me and told me that he and Melissa had split up. 'The reason he told me for the split was that they wanted different things. 'It was around December 2012 when I was told that the reason for the split was that Melissa had been seeing someone else. This was the first I had heard of anything. 'He was a very proud person, he did not like to be made a fool of, he committed himself 100 per cent to his relationship with Melissa. 'The final blow was that she had an affair with someone in his own team.' The inquest heard that all the police equipment was checked and accounted for on February 17th, but at 4.55am the following morning he used his swipe card to get back into his station. Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Mary Hassell said: 'He was the consummate professional - he was the person that everybody wanted to work with. 'Everyone knew about his personal problems and wanted to help. They gave him a hug. He was described in terms of being adored. 'It seems incredible that this extraordinary person took his own life. 'He had a lovely family, he had a great job and colleagues that adored him. 'But his romantic life had gone wrong and he was devastated about that. 'Although the majority of those around him never had any inclination, he had attempted to take his own life in the past and this was because of a romantic relationship that had gone wrong. 'I heard that in his last relationship he gave unconditional love. 'He was desperately sad. I think having given that unconditional love and that relationship disintegrating and not returning to what he wanted, I think he decided the only way out he saw was to take his life. And I think that is what he did.' PC Smelt’s mother, who sat next to his father at the inquest, collapsed in tears as the verdict was announced and was hugged by her daughter, PC Smelt’s younger sister. A statement from the Metropolitan Police Service said: 'MPS firearms officers undergo rigorous tactical training and regular refresher training. 'This includes self-awareness training for individuals and supervisors and is further supported by annual health screening. 'Protection officers are also subject to the highest vetting levels as part of the robust selection process. 'Steps are taken to ensure that officers are mentally and physically fit for deployment in this role, including regular re-authorisation processes and an annual re-application process, which requests senior officers support for the continued deployment of that officer based upon their line manager's recommendation.' The police said that PC Smelt was up to date with his assessments and that they have no official reports that Mr Smelt had made previous attempts on his life. They added that while it was not common practice for officers to take firearms home with them, they could be given permission in exceptional circumstances and would require authorisation from a senior officer.","PC Colin Smelts was a member of elite Special Protection Command .

Jailed: Shamin Uddin was jailed for 19 years for his part in a sex gang which exploited two vulnerable teenage girls, one of whom said she was dismissed as a 'nuisance teenager' when her mother asked social workers to intervene . A schoolgirl who fell victim to a sex gang has claimed she was dismissed as a 'nuisance teenager' and placed in a string of care homes by social workers after her family begged them for help. The youngster, who came from a loving family and was a 'model' pupil at school, was raped after she was lured into an 'underworld' of drink, drugs and wild parties. When her mother tried to intervene, the girl was placed in a series of care homes and was assumed by council officials to be 'misbehaving'. Details of the case emerged as three men were jailed for a total of 37 years for sexually exploiting the vulnerable teenager, known as Girl A, and another youngster, Girl B. Shamin Uddin, 26, nicknamed 'Sham', was . jailed for 19 years after being found guilty of raping both girls, . who can not be named for legal reasons, attempted rape and sexual activity with a child. His brother Giash Uddin, 27, nicknamed 'Gee' was found guilty of sexual activity with a child and jailed for six years, while Robert Jackson, 23, was sentenced to 12 years in prison after he was convicted of one charge of rape. Two other men were . cleared of sex charges at Manchester Crown Court. During their ordeal, the girls were taken to hotels and houses and passed around for intercourse - often when they were too drunk to protest. The girls, then aged 14 and 15, would drink until they were physically sick, and at times were unable to lift their heads from the bed as the men took it in turns to rape them, it was said. The school friends said they were escorted to different parties around Manchester - which sometimes lasted days - and were expected to sleep with men. One of the girls’ mothers even telephoned one of the abusers when her daughter came home 'intoxicated' with chewed and reddened lips and bruised legs - only for him to reply: 'It’s nothing to do with me - I have a wife and family.' Stockport Safeguarding Children Board are now considering whether to carry out serious case reviews in respect of the way they dealt with the youngsters. Speaking after today's sentencing, Girl A, now 18, from Stockport, Greater Manchester said: 'At the time I didn’t realise what was happening to me - I thought it was normal. I thought this was what young girls did and this was what boyfriends did to their girlfriends. 'I thought that I knew better than my . parents. I was young, I was naive. My mum started to notice that . something was going on but unfortunately because of how bad things had . got my mum couldn’t deal with it the right way so it caused conflict . between us. 'I didn’t tell . her anything, I would shout and she would shout at me and I would go out . and she would be worried and calling the police. 'She . asked for help and it was disregarded. The local authorities just . thought I was being a teenager and a nuisance and just misbehaving. Convicted: Giash Uddin, left, 27 was jailed for six years after he was found guilty of sexual activity with a child, while Robert Jackson, 23 was sentenced to 12 years in prison after he was convicted of one charge of rape . 'Nobody took notice and it wasn’t until it I had got so badly involved that I was coming home intoxicated by drugs and being sick and really poorly that the authorities took me seriously, by this point it was too late, I was too involved.' She added: 'There were opportunities were people could have helped but I was just being moved to different care homes in the same area. My family had asked for help numerous times and they just didn’t get any.' Manchester Crown Court was told the girls met the men in 2008 after one was introduced to them through another girl before being 'used and abused as available bodies for sexual pleasure.' Girl A added: 'I had never been to parties before. In school I had good grades, I come from a good family. My parents worked, I wasn’t used to doing anything like this. 'I had never drank alcohol before. Maybe at Christmas I would be allowed one small glass of wine with lemonade, but I never drank alcohol, I never smoked cigarettes, I never swore, I never used to wear make up. 'I had never been in trouble in school, never been in trouble with the police - this was a completely different world to me. 'I had met older girls from school and this is what they were doing. Because I was younger I looked up to them and followed what they were doing. It was not something I had done from being young. 'These girls were introducing me to guys who had really nice cars and lots of money and smoking cigarettes and weed and buying expensive beer and driving fast in cars. I was excited by it -, anybody would be excited by that. 'It wasn’t until I got to about 16 . and I realised that something wasn’t right. The fast cars had stopped . and there was no more excitement to it, this was just what was going on. I had just got caught up in it. 'I . wasn’t able to tell anybody about it. My relationship with my family . had broken down so much that there was no communication there so that I . couldn’t go and speak to my parents or aunts and uncles. I was so . confused - I didn’t know what was going on.' Abused: Manchester Crown Court, pictured, heard how the girls met the men in 2008 and were 'used and abused as available bodies for sexual pleasure' Girl B also regularly went missing from home leaving her mother and grandmother 'worried sick' about her. She was introduced to the men through Girl A, and during one early encounter recalled going to a house at 5am after drinking Jack Daniels and wine. She was said to be 'sick, hyper and giddy' and started dancing and drinking Tequila before having sex with one of the men. Later, at a hotel, she was raped as three men laughed and pointed at her on the bed. Police began investigating in 2011 after social workers became concerned about girls going missing from home and 40 girls were spoken to. Girl A later took officers to one of the houses where she had been raped. Girl B picked out the gang at identity parades. Detective Chief Inspector Pete Marsh, who has led the investigation, said: 'This group exploited the fact their two young victims were vulnerable and impressionable, bombarding them with a constant stream of attention and gifts of alcohol. 'I would like to praise the courage of these two young women who have stood up and given evidence against these despicable men at court, meaning they are no longer free to prey on other vulnerable young girls such as themselves.' David Mellor, Chair of Stockport Safeguarding Children Board, said: 'Every member of the SSCB is committed to working together to prevent the sexual exploitation of children, protect those at risk of exploitation, ensure offenders are brought to justice and help people to recover. 'Additionally, the SSCB will now consider whether to conduct serious case reviews in respect of the two young people.'","Vulnerable teenagers were lured into 'underworld' of drink and drugs .

More than a week after Jerry the carriage horse collapsed in Salt Lake City, PETA is offering a reward of up to $1,000 for information leading to his whereabouts. The 13-year-old dapple-gray half-Thoroughbred/half-Percheron horse collapsed while pulling a carriage through downtown traffic in sweltering heat. Jerry was left lying for several hours on the scorching pavement, before his owners eventually moved him via forklift to a nearby stable. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . The wrong horse: Annette Overson has admitted to MailOnline that the horse in this photo isn't Jerry . The real Jerry: PETA is offering a reward of up to $1,000 for information leading to his whereabouts . The incident attracted a great deal of attention and had animal rights advocates both in and . outside of Salt Lake City calling for an end to the ‘cruel industry’ of horse drawn carriage rides. In response to concerns about Jerry’s recovery, Annette Overson, who co-owns Carriage for Hire, the company that carries out the rides, provided The Salt Lake Tribune with a photo that she claimed was Jerry standing up in a stable. But animal rights activists at PETA weren’t convinced by that the horse in the photo. According to PETA research project manager Jeremy Beckham, Jerry is dappled gray - a description also mentioned in an Animal Services report - but the horse in Overson’s picture had a different coloring pattern called 'flea bitten' gray. Collapsed: The 13-year-old carriage horse collapsed near the end of a tour in Salt Lake City earlier this month. His leg was scraped as rescuers tried to lift him from the street . He sought the opinion of an expert and contacted Jennifer Hack of the United States Equine Rescue League. She pointed out that while the horse in Overson’s image has a white mark, called a snip, above its lip. The horse in Beckham’s images did not. 'These markings do not change over time as they come from the color of the skin,' Hack wrote to Beckham, 'so a horse that is born with a snip can not suddenly not have one, and vice versa.' Overson has since admitted to Mailonline that she had tried to pass off another horse as Jerry and described her actions as ‘stupid’. She confirmed that Jerry had been moved to another farm where he was continuing his recovery, but refused to give any further details. She also said that company employees had received threats. Now PETA are offering a reward of up to $1,000 for information leading to the whereabouts of Jerry. Happier times: Witnesses at the scene of Jerry's collapse say he was treated with the utmost concern for his safety by caretakers and veterinarians. Here, Jerry is pictured relaxing at his barn before his collapse . Stubborn: Around 60 concerned people gathered at the scene. Each time they tried to get Jerry up he 'whinnied and neighed' and refused to move . 'After reviewing the video footage of . the incident and consulting with equine experts and veterinarians, we . question the diagnosis of colic and subsequent reports from Carriage for . Hire,' said Beckham. 'We . urge animal control to enter and inspect the stable where Jerry was . allegedly housed, as authorized by Salt Lake City regulations, and to . subpoena veterinary records. 'We fear that Jerry may have become another victim of the cruel horse-carriage trade.' Jerry was near the end of a tour when he suddenly kicked his stomach and collapsed to the ground on August 17. Changes? The animal reportedly suffered a bout of colic, which caused the collapse. Animal advocates are now calling for a ban on horse drawn carriage rides in the Utah city . Controversy: This photo provided by PETA shows Jerry being lifted into a barn with a forklift . ‘[He] just didn’t want to move,’ city resident Ronald Schulthies told the Salt Lake Tribune. ‘His eyes were open and when we’d move him, he’d neigh and whinny.’ Schulthies was among some 60 concerned passersby. Veterinarians would also soon come to the 1,800 pound horse’s aid. At first, all they could do was try to comfort the animal. ‘It was distressing because lots of . people there wanted to do something, but didn’t know what to do,’ Schulthies said. ‘Obviously, the carriage company didn’t have any plan . for that type of thing.’ Schulthies . said Jerry would attempt to stand but quickly fall back down. He . emphasized that the horse was treated with only the utmost concern for . his health and well-being.",13-year-old Jerry collapsed earlier this month due to a bout of colic .

She was the greengrocer's daughter who went on to become one of the most celebrated - yet divisive - Prime Ministers of all time. Now Margaret Thatcher is to be honoured in her hometown of Grantham, Lincolnshire, with a new statue following her death earlier this year.

Mrs Thatcher's famous handbag in one of the designs which has been put forward . Two of the proposed designs depict the Iron Lady standing upright, clutching her famous bag, while the third portrays her in a more relaxed pose sitting down. One of the ideas includes having discs around the base of the monument, engraved with Mrs Thatcher's most famous quotes. It has not yet been decided which design will be used, nor where the statue will be placed in the town, but the designs show it standing metres away from a sculpture of Sir Isaac Newton who was educated in Grantham and brought up in nearby Woolsthorpe Manor. The Grantham Community Heritage Association, the charity which funds Grantham Museum, announced plans to raise money for the statue earlier this year. The project aims to raise £200,000 with at least half of the cash going towards museum renovations and exhibitions which celebrate Mrs Thatcher's achievements. Helen Goral, Grantham Museum chairman, said the artist's impressions . would give people an idea of how the 'historic project' could look. She said: 'We are releasing three designs just to give people an . opportunity to discuss them really. It's always going to be a . controversial subject - people will have something to say. 'I think it's important for Grantham that people embrace its heritage and we have got to do something good for the town. Mrs Thatcher lived in Grantham with her family before pursuing a career in politics.

Margaret Thatcher (right) pictured with her family including father, Alfred Roberts, who had a grocer's shop in the town of Grantham . But proposals for the statue have been met with controversy, with some suggesting the need for a plinth to protect it from vandals.

The drawings will be available to view within the museum and online at www.margaretthatcherstatue.org from today, with people encouraged to comment on which design they like best. There is already a bronze sculpture of Mrs Thatcher in the Houses of Parliament. Miss Goral added: 'We have an advisory panel in place that, along with the sculptor, will advise on specifics of pose. 'These impressions are to give the public an indication of what it will look like in situ. They are to be used as a basis of discussion. 'It's a hugely exciting stage in the project and one that we couldn't have achieved without support from the local community and further afield. 'The opportunity for Grantham to embrace it's rich heritage and exploit it for the good of the town is something that should be welcomed.' Margaret Thatcher became MP for Finchley in 1959, and was the Conservative Prime Minister between 1979 and 1990. The school that helped propel the Iron Lady to No 10 was yesterday awarded Grade II-listed status by Heritage Minister, Ed Vaizey. Mrs Thatcher, who attended Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School between 1936 and 1943, said she would not have made it to Downing Street 'but for this school'.","Margaret Thatcher grew up above her father's green grocer's shop in Grantham, South Lincolnshire .

Some staff used hand-pumps to fill little ones lungs full of oxygen. Three women gave birth in the dark to the light of a glow stick. Today, those babies are one and starting to walk and talk. Emma Martinez weighed less than two pounds when she came into the world. Now she is taking her first steps on her own. A . year ago, Emma was just three weeks old and had been on a ventilator in .

A night to remember: Some 1,000 staff members -- doctors, nurses, residents and medical students -- along with firefighters and police officers evacuated the patients. Much of the work was done by flashlight . Julia Alemany was in labor when the hospital lost power. Doctors gave her an epidural using the light from a cellphone. by the light of a cellphone, and then she was evacuated -- still having contractions -- down eight flights of stairs on a sled. ‘Very slowly they belayed her down like a rock climber,’ said her husband, Doron Markus to NBC News.

Her . parents could see the swirling floodwaters from their hospital room but . nevertheless chose to stay put at Langone instead of being evacuated. The following morning she was taken on a media tour as her parents conducted interviews with the national press.

Donald. ‘She has definitely got a feisty kind of positive determination . about her.’ The family was resting in their 13th floor hospital room as the storm began to ramp up. When the lights went out, staff gave them a flashlight, and they hunkered down until they evacuated the building before dawn. That flashlight is tucked in Freda’s birth box – ready for a  future bedtime story for a little girl born on a big day. NYU Langone: With its combination of clinical, research and academic facilities, may have been the New York City hospital that was most devastated by Hurricane Sandy. The East River filled the basement . William Donovan was born with a serious heart defect and had only just come off a ventilator in Langone’s Congenital Cardiovascular Care Unit two days before Sandy hit. His dad, Jeremy, rushed to the hospital to check on his three-week-old son. The hospital were evacuating the 15th floor as he arrived. ‘He slept through the entire endeavor. He has had more stressful nights at the supermarket than he did in the hurricane,’ Jeremy said.  ‘He was pretty laidback during the whole thing.’ Daria Shurba and her husband Dmitry welcomed their baby Maria into the world early on October 29. Daria had been praying that her ‘little munchkin’ would arrive before Sandy. ‘Luckily, my daughter was smart enough to decide to come out right before the hurricane,’ she said. After the blackout, they felt the building shake and the windows rumbles as Sandy passed over. The Shurbas were eventually evacuated uptown to Lenox Hill Hospital. As they left there a day later, they looked to see if they could add Sandra as a middle name to the birth certificate that they’d already filed. ‘This is something that she should be proud of,’ Daria said. ‘That she is one of those hurricane babies and she did great.’","When Sandy hit, NYU Langone hospital lost power .

Living in ramshackle tents and racing daily to be first in line for free hot food, this is hardly a holiday camp. But for many of the hundreds of migrants living in makeshift campsites in northern France, the prospect of a better life in the UK rather than that of returning home to Iraq or Afghanistan makes it worth enduring the less-than-luxury conditions. While an army of volunteers from a charity set up to help them provides warm food and clothing at the moment, the 1,000 or so migrants who have set up camp in Calais and the surrounding towns are desperate to make it to Britain. Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart has described the number of migrants trying to make it across the Channel as 'untenable', blaming the UK benefits system for creating 'a plague' of camps which are 'tarnishing the town's image'. Temporary home: Migrants camp in makeshift tents near to the Calais ferry port in France. Thousands of migrants have set up temporary home in the area . First in line: Migrants race to accept the offer of a daily free hot meal supplied by a charity set up after the French Government closed down the Sangatte refugee centre .

Road to Britain: Graffiti purporting to direct migrants to the border is scrawled across a Calais road sign . Desperate: Migrants walk on railway tracks beside their makeshift campsite close to the ferry terminal . She has previously blamed Britain's 'enormous' state hand-outs for luring migrants to her town and using it as a staging area hoping to be granted leave to get across the 26 mile or so stretch of water that separates us and France. These pictures show what life is like in the makeshift camps that house as steady stream of migrants wanting to head to the UK. They show volunteers from French charity SALAM, which has a lock up full of clothing, fruit and vegetables in the area ready to supply to the camps. Around 300 people tirelessly peel fruit and vegetables and ferry a hot meal once a day to Calais and three times a week at three other nearby towns. The charity was set up in 2002 following the closure of the Red Cross centre in Sangatte and started with just a handful of volunteers. According to the charity, the migrants are mostly young men are mostly from countries including Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Kurdistan, Iraq, Palestine and Somalia. To get a handle on the steady stream of migrants living temporarily in northern France and attempting to claim asylum in the UK, Sangatte acted as a stepping stone for 50,000 immigrants to enter the UK and could house 1,000 at any one time - though it was often over capacity. Sorting donations: SALAM volunteers sort through boxes of clothing in a store run by the charity at Calais . Getting organised: Polo shirts and T shirts are separated into long and short sleeved at the SALAM clothes store. The charity has more than 300 volunteers helping migrants . Daily sustenance: Two migrants sit and enjoy their daily meal supplied by the charity which was set up in 2002 . Tireless work: An army of volunteers work together to peel fruit and vegetables as part of an operation to feed the hundreds of migrants hoping to cross the Channel to the UK . Former president Nicolas Sarkozy ordered the destruction of a squalid woodland camp known as the Jungle in 2009 and bussed almost 300 refugees out of the area. A year later, another 100 migrants were removed from a woodland encampment in the Channel coast town of Teteghem. Earlier this month, several hundred migrants from Syria occupied the ferry terminal at Calais. They demanded to be granted passage to the UK after claiming they were treated 'like dogs' by the French authorities. Just last week, the mayor of Calais hit out at the number of migrants setting up illegal squats in her town. Mrs Bouchart, 50, has previously blamed Britain’s asylum and benefits system for ‘imposing’ hundreds of illegal migrants on her city. Cooking: One volunteer heats up meals in giant pots ready to be served to those at the makeshift camp . Not going hungry: A hot meal is served in Calais every evening, at about 6.15 pm while food is also served every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday in nearby Loon-Plage, Grande Synthe and Teteghem .

Two brothers have reportedly returned home to Ireland after escaping a notorious jail in Venezuela where they were serving an 11 year stretch for cocaine smuggling. Leigh and Dermot O'Neill reportedly walked out of the front door of the San Juan de los Morros prison just outside Caracas in broad daylight. According to an Irish priest who was contacted by the pair after their escape, the brothers left the prison with a Venezuelan inmate and stayed with his family before returning home. Jailbreak: Leigh and Dermot O'Neill are said to have walked out of the front doors of the notorious San Juan de los Morros prison in Venezuela. Inmates are the prison are pictured in the yard . Father John Jennings, who has spent 30 years in Caracas, told the Irish Sun: 'They went to a local bus terminal and the mother of the Venezeulan took the three of them to their house in the countryside. 'Most likely they would have handed over a lot of money. 'You don't just walk out the front door without help from the officials.' Residents of the brothers' home town Athlone told the Belfast Telegraph that they have been seen with their sister in recent days. One resident said: 'We don't know if they got out themselves or were let out to be honest, but they're home anyway, that's for sure.' Leigh, 25, and Dermot, 21, were less than a year into their jail term when they escaped. They were sentenced last year when fellow Irishman Martin Beirne, with whom they were travelling in the South American country, died in a Caracas hotel room when a cocaine-filled balloon urst in his stomach. Although the pair initially fled, they were later arrested. Back home: Residents of Athlone in Ireland claim that they have seen the brothers back in the town in recent days . Leigh later passed 92 cocaine-filled balloons with a street value of 50,000 Euros. Although Leigh pleaded guilty to drug smuggling offences, his brother denied all charges and no drugs were found on him. They had been inmates alongside drug traffickers and gang bosses at the prison which holds some 1,000 prisoners despite only having a capacity of 250. New plight: The brothers' escape comes as Michaella McCollum Connolly (left), from Belfast, and Melissa Reid (right) face jail charged with allegedly trying to smuggle cocaine out of Peru . Venezeulan jails are notoriously dangerous with as many of 400 inmates killed each year according to human rights groups. Father Jennings said there has been no mention of the brothers' escape in the Venezuelan media. An uncle of the pair, named only as Tommy in the Irish Sun, said that the family were 'over the moon' that they were out of prison. They reportedly made their escape across the border to Columbia, eventually reaching Bogota before making their way back to Ireland. Although the Venezuelan authorities did not confirm Leigh and Dermot's escape, according to the Irish Sun a prison source said that if they are asked of the O'Neill brothers' whereabouts they will claim they were killed and buried inside the prison grounds. The brothers apparent escape comes as 20-year-old Michaela McCollum, from belfast, and 19-year-old Melissa Reid face jail in Peru on charges of alleged drug smuggling. The two young women were arrested after allegedly trying to smuggle £1.5million of cocaine out of the country. The pair claim that they were held at gunpoint and forced to smuggle the drugs, which were hidden in food packaging, out of the country.","Leigh and Dermot O'Neill are said to have left San Juan de los Morros prison near Caracas .

Red alert: Carrot tops such as Julianne Moore carry a gene mutation that lowers their skin cell DNA protection against deadly sunlight damage . Prince Harry, Mick Hucknall and Julianne Moore all share a deadly secret linked to their carroty locks. The gene responsible for red hair also leaves a person up to 100 times more susceptible to the worst form of skin cancer, scientists have shown. It was always known that fair-skinned red-heads are at greater risk of melanoma, which claims more than 2,000 lives a year in the UK. Now U.S. researchers believe they have discovered why. A particular gene mutation that colours hair red leaves DNA in skin cells more prone to damaged by sunlight. Laboratory and mouse experiments showed that the MC1R-RHC gene variant both lowered a cell's guard against harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, and stimulated cancer-causing biological signals. RHC stands for 'red hair colour'. Study leader Dr Wenyi Wei, from Harvard Medical School in Boston, said: 'Together, our findings provide a possible molecular mechanism as to why red-haired individuals harboring MC1R mutations are much more susceptible to UV-induced skin damage than individuals with darker skin, resulting in a 10 to 100-fold higher frequency of melanoma.' It all adds up to bad news for Prince Harry and others of his ilk. Melanoma is diagnosed in about 13,000 people each year in the UK and is responsible for three quarters of all skin cancer deaths. The cancer originates in pigment-producing skin cells called melanocytes. Previous research had shown that the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene plays a key role in protecting melanocytes from UV-induced DNA damage. Under normal circumstances MC1R binds to and protects another gene well known for its ability to suppress tumours, PTEN. The new work demonstrates that the red hair version of MC1R no longer acts as a PTEN guardian. 'As a result, upon UVB exposure, we saw an increased destruction of PTEN in the mutated pigment cells,' said Dr Wei. The same mutation was linked to the ramping up of a biological signalling pathway, P13K/Akt which is implicated in a number of cancers, including breast, ovarian and lung. Other red-heads such as Prince Harry and Mick Hucknall should take extra care in the sun . A further connection was found with a mutation in the BRAF gene which is found in 70 per cent of human melanomas. Scientists say there is also a glimmer of light in the findings, reported online in the journal Molecular Cell. The research could open up avenues of study leading to new melanoma treatments or ways of identifying highly at-risk individuals. 'We think that MC1R variants, in combination with mutations in the BRAF gene, could be used as markers of an increased risk of developing melanoma,' said Dr Wei. There was also a suggestion that compounds that inhibit P13K/Akt could be combined with the skin cancer drug vemurafenib to treat some melanomas.","Gene mutation in red heads makes skin DNA more susceptible to UV damage .

It is alleged military chiefs under the George W Bush and Barack Obama administrations allowed Major Hasan to progress through the ranks despite his increasing jihad extremism because of 'political correctness'. Reed Rubinstein, the lawyer acting for the group, told the Sunday Telegraph that Major Hasan w as awarded 'preferential treatment' because of his 'ethnicity and his religion'. He said: 'The rules on the conduct of military officers were ignored. He was a terrible physician and had no business treating soldiers. 'Yet, because of where he came from, and how he prayed to his god, they promoted him and set him loose and ignored his open, very obvious jihadism.' Mr Rubenstein added that the group wanted the government to meet 'its responsibilities to those harmed by its negligence' over Major Hasan. Major Nidal Hasan, pictured left in his Army uniform, was apparently allowed to rise through the ranks unchecked despite his 'obvious jihadism'.  Video footage, right, shows him shopping at a 7-11 store wearing a traditional white jubba robe and white kufi skull cap  just outside Fort Hood seven hours before he shot 13 people dead . Major Hasan doesn't deny that he . carried out the November 2009 rampage at Fort Hood, one of the worst . mass shootings in U.S. history. The . attack occurred in a building where hundreds of unarmed soldiers, some . about to deploy to Afghanistan, were waiting for vaccines and routine . checkups. Hasan walked . inside with two handguns, climbed onto a desk and shouted 'Allahu . Akbar!' - an Arabic phrase meaning 'God is great!' - then he fired, . pausing only to reload. There . are dozens of witnesses who saw it happen but military law prohibits . him from entering a guilty plea because authorities are seeking the . death penalty. If Hasan is . convicted and sentenced to death there are likely years, if not . decades, of appeals ahead. He may never make it to the death chamber at . all. Ahead of his trial, . the Army psychiatrist spoke to the American media for the first time . last week and said that the U.S. government is at war with Islam. Thirteen people were killed and 32 injured in the November 2009 shooting at Fort Hood military base in Texas . In . the past, Major Nidal Hasan has only spoken via telephone with . Al-Jazeera, the transcript of which is evidence in his upcoming trial. 'My . complicity was on behalf of a government that openly acknowledges that . it would hate for the law of Almighty Allah to be the supreme law of the . land,' Hasan said in the lengthy statement released to Fox News on . Saturday. He then says in reference to a war on Islam, 'I participated in it.' 'I . would like to begin by repenting to Almighty Allah and apologize to the . Mujahideen, the believers, and the innocent. ... I ask for their . forgiveness for participating in the illegal and immoral aggression . against Muslims, their religion and their lands,' he said in the . statement. He has twice . dismissed his lawyers and now plans to represent himself at trial. He's . suggested he wants to argue the killings were in 'defense of others' - . namely, members of the Taliban fighting Americans in Afghanistan. The . trial judge, Col. Tara Osborn, has so far denied that strategy. Thirteen . officers from around the country who hold Hasan's rank or higher will . serve on the jury for a trial that will likely last one month and . probably longer. They must be unanimous to convict Hasan of murder and . sentence him to death. Three-quarters of the panel must vote for an . attempted murder conviction. No active-duty U.S. soldier has been executed since 1961. The . last man executed in the military system was Pvt. John Bennett, hanged . in 1961 for raping an 11-year-old girl. Five men are on the military . death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, but none are close to being . executed.","Muslim Major Nidal Hasan's trial is due to start on August 6 .

Supermarket giant Tesco has been slammed by customers and animal charities over an advert which appears to condone getting a puppy for Christmas. An image in the shop's glossy festive gift guide features a child dashing past a blackboard with a scrawled message reading: 'All I want for Christmas is a puppy'. The supermarket's Facebook page has been bombarded with complaints from hundreds of appalled shoppers - with many saying they have have abandoned the store over the ad. Controversy: Tesco's festive gift brochure has sparked complaints over a photograph which apparently encourages shoppers to put a puppy on their Christmas list . Customer service workers at Tesco have been fielding complaints from dog lovers, as charity the Dogs Trust - which coined the iconic slogan 'A Dog is for Life, Not Just for Christmas' 35 years ago - waded into the row. A spokesman from the charity said: 'Dogs Trust is incredibly disappointed to see the latest Tesco Magazine which shows a background image of a blackboard with the words ""All I want for Christmas is a puppy"". 'The charity's iconic slogan is 35 years old this Christmas but is sadly still as relevant today. 'We know many children would put a pup on . their Xmas list so we spend a considerable amount of time, money and . effort reminding parents about the commitment and responsibility owning a . dog entails.' Boycott: Some shoppers said they had abandoned the store over the image which features a child with a blackboard message reading 'All I want for Christmas is a puppy' The RSPCA added: 'We would remind any parents wanting to get any animal as a present that pets are a lifelong commitment and would need a responsible adult to care for him or her. 'Careful consideration would be needed to ensure the animal would be loved for life and not just a short-term novelty.' One customer Lesley Waugh wrote on Facebook: 'I'm no longer a Tesco shopper after seeing their ad. Substantial donations to small rescues will get my custom back.' Lou Benney added: 'Tesco, why an earth did you think it was a good idea to advertise getting a puppy for xmas? 'A dog is for life, and rescues are full of dogs needing their forever homes, and no doubt that some of these poor dogs were once someone's xmas puppy.' Another Facebook user, Clive Rowley, described the promo picture was 'sickening'. He wrote: 'Tesco's current drive to incite children to ask for ""a puppy for christmas"" is just sickening. 'Uninformed people will buy a puppy, many of which will end up being put to sleep once the excitement of having a puppy wears off.' Charlotte Sankey said that the advert jeopardised the hard work of animal charities. She wrote: 'Animal charity's have been working hard for years to get the message across a dog is for life not just for Christmas. 'Rescue homes are overrun with unwanted dogs as it is and in January will be with the extra puppies that have been bought as presents at Christmas. 'Thousands of dogs are put to sleep each year because homes can't be found. 'I think you are thoughtless and irresponsible and need to rethink your advert. I will now be shopping elsewhere.' The image appears on page 36 of the new Tesco Gift Guide which is available now in stores. Not just for Christmas: Charity Dogs Trust, which coined the 'A Dog is For Life' slogan said it was 'disappointed' with the supermarket . It depicts a family home, decorated for Christmas, with a blackboard in the background containing the offending message. A spokeswoman from Tesco apologised for the magazine and said that it was not supposed to encourage people to buy pets from Christmas. She said: 'We're sorry that some people have taken offence at a picture in our magazine. 'It was not our intention to encourage people to buy dogs for Christmas.'","Message at odds with slogan 'A Dog is For Life, Not Just for Christmas'

A Mormon mother of seven who was jailed in Mexico on drug smuggling charges walked free last night after a surveillance video cleared her of transporting marijuana. Yanira Maldonado, 42, of Goodyear, Arizona, was greeted by well-wishers as she left the lockup on the outskirts of Nogales and hugged her husband, Gary, as officials closed the jail doors behind her. 'I'm home! Finally!' Maldonado screamed as she crossed the border back into Arizona. Maldonado was arrested by the Mexican military last week after they found nearly 12 pounds (5.4 kilograms) of pot under her seat on the commercial bus traveling from Mexico to Arizona. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Release: Yanira Maldonado was greeted by well-wishers as she left the lockup on the outskirts of Nogales and hugged her husband, Gary, as officials closed the jail doors behind her . Release: Yanira Maldonado, 42, accompanied by her husband, Gary, center, speaks to an official after being released from a prison on the outskirts of Nogales, Mexico . 'She lived through a nightmare,' said her attorney, Jose Francisco Benitez Paz. The case prompted outrage in the U.S. among politicians and pitted the . conservative Mormon family against a judicial system that has long . struggled with corruption. Her release came hours after court . officials reviewed security footage that showed her and her husband . boarding a bus in Mexico with only blankets, bottles of water and her . purse in hand. The judge determined that she was no longer a suspect and all allegations against her were dropped, according to Benitez Paz. She spoke briefly to reporters clustered outside the jail, saying: 'Many thanks to everyone, especially my God who let me go free, my family, my children, who with their help, I was able to survive this test.' With that she and her husband walked . hand in hand to a waiting car, departing for the U.S. border several . miles away. Once in Nogales, Arizona, she spoke again about her ordeal. Decision: The judge determined that she was no longer a suspect and all allegations against her were dropped, according to Benitez Paz . Relieved: Yanira Maldonado and her husband embraced for a considerable duration as she walked of jail . Release: Yanira is seen leaving the complex hand-in-hand with her husband Gary on Thursday night . 'I love Mexico,' said Maldonado, who was born there. 'My family is still there. So Mexico... it's not Mexico's fault. It's a few people who you know did this to me.' But speaking to Arizona's 12 News, she added: 'I'm not coming back to Mexico. It's a slap in the face Mexico has given me after I've defended them when I hear people talk bad about them.' A judge had until late Friday to . decide whether to free her or send her to another prison in Mexico while . state officials continued to build their case. Gary Maldonado said earlier on Thursday he was confident that the video would exonerate his wife, and suggested a man sitting behind them who fled the scene could have been responsible for the drugs. Mr Maldonado was originally arrested . after the pot was found under his wife's bus seat on a commercial bus . traveling from Mexico to Phoenix as they returned from her aunt's funeral. Separated: Yanira Maldonado was with her husband Gary, both pictured, when they were stopped in Mexico and accused of smuggling drugs. Mr Maldonado remains in a Mexican prison . Family: The couple, who have seven children between them . After Yanira Maldonado begged the . soldiers to allow her to come along to serve as translator, the military . officials decided to release him and arrest her instead, he said. Benitez Paz, who had also predicted . to reporters that the video would lead to her freedom, noted that it was . a fairly sophisticated smuggling effort that included packets of drugs . attached to the seat bottoms with metal hooks - a task that would have . been impossible for a passenger like Maldonado. 'All the evidence they have is the drug under the seat,' he said. The Maldonados were traveling home to . the Phoenix suburb of Goodyear after attending her aunt's funeral in . the city of Los Mochis when they were arrested. The couple took the bus because they . thought it would be safer than driving. They had taken a similar bus . during a separate trip in Mexico. Gary Maldonado said authorities . originally demanded $5,000 for her release, but the bribe fell through. Shocked: Mrs Maldonado said she never saw the drugs she is accused of smuggling - not even after she was arrested . When the couple tried to defend themselves, military officials told them . the court would sort it out, Gary Maldonado said. 'We never thought this would ever . happen,' said Gary Maldonado, who doesn't speak Spanish and couldn't . understand the court proceedings involving his wife. Gary Maldonado said a man sitting . behind them on the bus fled during the inspection. He believes the man . might have been the true owner of the drugs. 'We think she is being framed,' he said. 'The bus was already [en route] from Culiacan' when they boarded. Yanira Maldonado said she does not think she was necessarily targeted. 'Someone smuggled those in there, and I probably sat in the wrong seat,' she said. Mexican officials provided local . media with photos that they said were of the packages Maldonado is . accused of smuggling. Each was about 5 inches high and 20 inches wide, . roughly the width of a bus seat. The marijuana was packed into plastic bags and wrapped in tan packing tape. Yanira . Maldonado said she has been relying on her faith and the support of her . family to keep her spirits up as she fights for her freedom. Evidence? Mexican officials claim these are the marijuana bundles that were found under Yanira Maldonado's bus seat . 'I've . been reading the scriptures, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, . fasting,' Maldonado told CNN before her release. 'And all the support that I've been . getting from my family, my husband, my children, and everybody out there . reaching out to help.' In the tearful interview - which Maldonado gave from what appears to be an office in Nogales, Mexico, federal prison - the devout Mormon mother said she was shocked when the drugs were found. 'I was at the checkpoint. They asked us to get off bus. And they were checking for drugs or I don't know what else,' she said. 'And they say they found something under my seat. But I never saw anything. They didn't show me anything. It was just amazing all that, what they did.' In the interview, Maldonado said she is a religious family woman who was innocent of the charges leveled against her. 'I'm a good mom. I love the gospel. I'm LDS. And we work hard to have what we have. You know, we're not . rich, but we're very honest and we always do our best to help other . people,' she said. Maldonado's family has accused the army officers of framing her in an effort to extort a bribe. Drug traffickers have increasingly been using passenger buses to move U.S.-bound drugs through Mexico. In a notorious case, federal police . in 2011 found half a ton of marijuana hidden under the seats of a bus . headed to Piedras Negras, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas. They . arrested the driver and two other people. Federal agents and soldiers have set . up checkpoints throughout Mexico's main highways and have routinely . seized cocaine, marijuana, heroin and other illegal drugs from buses. When drug suspects are arrested in . Mexico, they face a murky situation. Mexico's justice system is carried . out largely in secret, with proceedings done almost entirely in writing. 'Innocent': The Maldonados, who are Mormon, said they do not even drink and have never taken drugs . 'Bribes': The couple were told they could pay off the judge because 'that's how things work here' Four years ago, Mexico decriminalized . the possession of small amounts of marijuana, cocaine and heroin, but . it still has stiff penalties for drug trafficking. Mexican law doesn't specify a minimum . or maximum sentence in drug crimes and leaves it up to the judge to . decide how long the sentence should be, said Jose Luis Manjarrez, a . spokesman for federal prosecutors in Mexico. Earlier this week, Benitez presented . testimony from Yanira Maldonado and from two relatives who accompanied . the couple to the Los Mochis bus station, and two fellow passengers on . the bus. All four testified that she had not been carrying any drugs. He described her as depressed while in jail, but she had not been abused or mistreated. Stopped: The couple were returning from a funeral when they were stopped at a checkpoint (file picture) 'She doesn't accept any of the . accusations that are being made,' he said earlier. 'She is sad because . of the situation, in which she's being accused of a crime she didn't . commit.' On Wednesday, an army lieutenant, a . private and another sergeant were supposed to appear in court but they . did not show up. The army did not explain why, Benitez said. Yanira Maldonado is a naturalized . U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico, her family said. She and Gary . Maldonado were married one year ago, and they celebrated their . anniversary while she was jailed. Jen Psaki, a U.S. State Department . spokeswoman, said U.S. consulate officials in Mexico had closely . monitored the case. State Department officials visited her Friday. 'Private citizens who travel abroad . are expected to, of course, abide by the law in the country where they . are visiting, and the consular office is in touch when cases like this . arise to be helpful in advising,' Psaki said in a press briefing in . Washington on Wednesday ahead of the release.","Yanira Maldonado was released from her Mexican jail at 10pm Thursday .

But it wasn't just Cara Delevingne and Miranda Kerr on the catwalk that caught the world's eye, it was hard to miss the A-list front row decked out in the classic Chanel staple: tweed. The classic country chic style is tipped to be the season's biggest trend and is already being sported by fashion's most forward thinker, Anna Wintour, as well as models Kate Upton, Cara Delevingne, Miranda Kerr and Clemence Posey.

Ian Berg took on a task of almost that size in 2010 when he bought Lendal Tower in York, an Ancient Scheduled Monument. The 700-year-old tower had been derelict for more than a decade when Mr Berg, a veteran of many conversions, decided to turn it into a modern home – and bravely entered into battle with a small army of bureaucrats intent on preserving as much of the tower as possible. ‘It looked in a sorry state when I first saw it,’ says the 47-year-old human resources consultant. ‘The roof was leaking and the windows were smashed. It had been left to rot, damp and pigeons. But I knew it was something special.’ High achiever: Ian Berg succeeded in the daunting task of restoring the 14th century Lendal Tower in York, and is now selling it for £1.35million . If location is everything, then it will be hard to find a better home in York. Built as part of the city’s medieval defences in 1299, on top of city foundations laid down by the Roman Emperor Severus, the tower sits on the eastern bank of the Ouse, alongside Lendal Bridge, and commands astonishing views of the river and city, including York Minster and the ruins of St Mary’s Abbey. With more than 2,500 sq ft of living space on three floors, including three bedrooms, three bathrooms and a roof terrace – you even get your own flagpole – Lendal Tower is now on the market for £1.35 million through Carter Jonas estate agency. Being a monument may have been its attraction for Ian Berg, but it also quickly proved to be its major drawback. Given its historic and cultural importance, there were as many restrictions on what could be renovated as there were things to repair – and several different agencies to deal with. ‘There was York City Council, English Heritage, planning officers, conservation officers, building regulations,’ he recalls. ‘The red tape was astonishing, but I’m lucky that negotiating with people is part of my job. The important thing is to have a vision, and to work towards that.’ Medieval style: Lendal Tower has more than 2,500¿sq ft of living space on three floors, including three bedrooms, three bathrooms and a roof terrace . Complete renovation: One of the three new bedrooms inside the tower . After its time protecting the city from invaders and tax-evaders – a great chain was stretched across the Ouse from Lendal Tower to Barker Tower on the opposite shore, to keep the enemy out and make sure visitors paid a toll – in 1677 the tower was leased to what would become the York Waterworks Company, and used as a pumping station. A donkey used to power the pump, tramping around the circular living room. If the animal was sick, prisoners would be drafted in to do the donkey work. In 1836, a dedicated engine house was built, requiring Queen Victoria to sign an Act of Parliament decommissioning Lendal Tower. After that it became the York Waterworks Company’s headquarters and, to make it worthy of its high-profile visitors, oak panelling, decoratively plastered ceilings and a Pickerings lift were added. An expert called in by Mr Berg to assess the lift found it to be in amazingly good working order – it had been used only twice a month to ferry executives to their meetings in the top-floor boardroom. Mr Berg was obliged to run everything past the various agencies to ensure as sympathetic a renovation as possible. Everything from wood (oak for ceiling beams, Scandinavian pine for upper floors) and radiators (cast iron) to windows and the colour of lime-washed walls had to be given the green light. In York, there was no shortage of master craftsmen, stonemasons, glaziers and carpenters to help him do the job. Atmospheric: An 1840 watercolour painting showing Lendal Tower before the completion of the bridge which saw the top section removed . Clever use has been made of the building’s unusual shape. Oak columns in the high-ceilinged living room support a mezzanine office/bedroom, utilising the dead space above and creating the feeling of a cosy farmhouse below. Opposite the lift on the ground floor are what appear to be large oak cabinets, actually a modern bathroom worthy of a high-class hotel. Having defended a city and watered its inhabitants, Lendal Tower’s current incarnation as a family home could be considered a form of retirement. If so, it’s certainly a comfortable one. The 4ft-thick walls lock in the warmth from underfloor heating and keep the noise out to such an extent that it’s difficult to believe you’re in the middle of a city. And its security is second to none: in its 700 years it has withstood attack by rebel barons, Oliver Cromwell’s roundheads and the Luftwaffe. Workmen discovered shrapnel damage from German bombs while repairing the roof. The renovations cost £200,000 alone, Mr Berg says, and took him 12 months – not bad considering the complexity of the project. Louise Hirst of Carter Jonas says location is as important when it comes to buying a medieval tower as it is with any other home. ‘You’d expect a piece of history like this to stand atop a grassy knoll. Instead, it’s in the heart of York,’ she says. Mr Berg is selling up because his job means he is spending little time in York these days, but he takes great pleasure in having brought Lendal Tower back to life. ‘The tower has stood for more than 700 years. I feel I’ve brought it up to standard and there’s no reason it can’t survive for another 700 years. It’s an incredible place and I’m very proud to have been part of its long and illustrious history.’ lcarterjonas.co.uk, 01904 558218 .","Lendal Tower, a 14th century landmark in York, on sale for £1.35m .

A conductor forced his passengers to get off the train so he could go to hospital after being bitten by a 12-inch Daxiedoodle puppy. The rail worker was walking through the train when he reached out to stroke the dog - a Dachshund/Poodle cross - sitting on its owner's lap. But it snapped back and chaos ensued. Stranded: Passengers were forced to get off at Fishbourne, West Sussex, as the conductor went to hospital . The man rushed to the tannoy of Sunday's 2.17pm Southern Rail service from London Victoria to Portsmouth Harbour, announcing: 'I’m very sorry but I am going have to terminate the train here. 'I have been bitten by a dog on the train and I am bleeding quite profusely. 'I am going to need urgent medical attention.' Menacing? The 12-inch-tall Daxiedoodle bit the conductor when he reached out to stroke it . Cross: Daxiedoodles have the personality and protectiveness of Dachshunds; the intelligence of Poodles . A cross between a Dachshund and a Poodle, Daxiepoodles are notoriously difficult to house-train. An owner must portray themselves as a leader of a pack to have any sway over their companion. Young Daxiedoodles - also referred to as Doxiepoos and Doodles - can be as small as six inches tall so they are rarely painted as menacing dogs. But they are incredibly hyperactive. From poodles, they inherit intelligence and minimum moulting. Their dachshund heritage gives them powerful personalities and protectiveness. Under 20 minutes from the final . destination, the service made an unscheduled stop at Fishbourne, West . Sussex, and everyone aboard was ushered off. The . bemused customers were then left standing on a platform in the rain as . the man clutched tissues to his injured hand and waited for an ambulance . to arrive. Eventually, a paramedic rushed on to the platform and took the conductor to hospital. Lorna Rowsewell, 25, from Portsmouth, said: 'I was heading back from London and this made me about an hour late home. 'The whole thing just seemed really ridiculous. 'It was a fluffy little grey dog that was with its owners and their children. 'It didn’t look like it could seriously hurt someone, even if it tried. 'No-one could understand why the conductor and his colleague couldn’t have just soldiered on for the remaining 20 minute journey. 'Thankfully we weren’t held up too long, but it did seem like a waste of resources to call an ambulance for a tiny dog bite.'

Tremendous grief: Mark Fear, born Francis, left a note saying he could not live without Kenneth . Acclaimed TV host Kenneth Kendall's grief-stricken partner killed himself after the veteran broadcaster's death having left a note saying he 'simply could not face the future' without him, an inquest heard. Francis Fear, 55, was found hanging at his £500,000 home just four months after the death of his partner of 23 years. Friends told the hearing today how the death of Mr Kendall - best known for presenting the hit series Treasure Hunt with Anneka Rice - had had a 'radical effect' on the art gallery owner who was known by his middle name Mark. Mr Kendall was 88 when, last December, he suffered a fatal stroke. In April this year, Mark Fear was found with a note left by his body at the three-bedroom home he had shared with his civil partner. Addressed to his friend Vicki Wyatt, it read: 'I am sorry to land you in all this. 'I simply cannot face the future without Kenneth. M x' The former interior designer also left instructions for her to look at the Notes application in his iPhone where his will and other documents could be found. Mr Fear had met the former presenter of Channel 4's Treasure Hunt in London and the couple had entered into a civil partnership in 2006. They opened the Kendall Fine Art gallery in Cowes on the Isle of Wight together where they moved following the presenter's retirement. Admirable: Friends told the inquest the relationship between Mark Fear (right) and Kenneth Kendall (left) was one to be admired and respected. The pair ran an art gallery together on the Isle of Wight . Mr Kendall was well known for making history on September 4, 1955, by becoming the first BBC newsreader to appear on TV. He . later co-starred in the popular game show Treasure Hunt where he . directed Anneka Rice around the country in a helicopter to search for . clues. Friend Neil Robertson . told the hearing that Mr Kendall's death had hit Mr Fear hard and with . his partner, Miss Wyatt, they had attempted to help him cope with his . grief. He said: 'It had a radical effect on him.' 'He . had concerns on a number of levels, principally the grief after losing . his partner, concerns about the viability of the business and the . economic status given the role Kenneth his partner played in providing . income and presence in the gallery.'

Here with Michael Aspel, Judith Chalmers, Nan Wilson . Newsreader Kendall (pictured) and Fear were together for 23 years before Kendall died in December . It is thought that Mr Fear struggled following the death of his partner of a stroke in December . Family and friends recognised that the keen sailor and former vice-commodore at the Royal London Yacht Club, was having difficulty coping and was prone to 'dark moods' so had rallied around him. Towards the end of February and the beginning of March, it appeared as though Mr Fear was improving. 'We all felt he was looking forward with positive thoughts about the future,' said Mr Robertson. He said that he last saw Mr Fear on the night before his death and together they watched their beloved Manchester United play on the television when he seemed to be 'relatively happy'. 'We talked about a number of issues, apart from the football about the social programme, moving forward, potential holidays, everything was positive, everything was the future,' he said. However, as he left, Mr Robertson added that he had found it 'eerie' when Mr Fear said to him: 'I've really enjoyed watching these Manchester United games with you.' The alarm was raised the following day when Mr Fear failed to turn up for an appointment at the gallery. 'By this stage I could almost say I knew what had happened,' said Mr Robertson. Mr Robertson and Miss Wyatt discovered Mr Fear hanged in his home on April 29. Police attended the home in Castle Road and found no suspicious circumstances and a post mortem examination concluded that the death was caused by asphyxia. High-flying: Kendall (right) joined Treasure . Hunt in 1982 and the show, which featured Anneka Rice (left) scouring . the country for clues in a helicopter, become a huge hit for the . fledgling Channel 4 . Celebrity friends: Kendall (second from right) appeared on a Christmas Day celebrity edition of Bullseye in 1983 . alongside fellow TV presenters (left to right) Anne Diamond, Judith . Hann, host Jim Bowen and Anne Aston . Assistant coroner for the Isle of Wight, John Matthews, said: 'He had suffered a tremendous grief following the death of partner in December 2012. 'His friends were very concerned about him, certainly the first month or two after his death and to an extent really looked after him to ensure as much as possible he wasn't on his own. 'He seemed to get better and his friends were hopeful that he would get back to a normal keel and indeed he was making plans with friend Mr Robertson for future holidays together and planning to watch more TV football matches. 'To all intents and purposes he was recovering and starting a new life without his partner. 'Sadly, we know that was not the case and it was not entirely a surprise when he was found dead.' The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide. The inquest heard that Mr Fear had a passion for sailing, was a co-owner of a racing yacht and owned a motorboat which he used to go on holidays with Mr Robertson and Miss Wyatt to the Channel Islands and to France. Speaking after the hearing, Miss Wyatt said: 'We had lots of adventures together with Mark, we had lots of fun together.' She added: 'Mark Fear and Kenneth Kendall had a 23-year relationship, and as civil partners from the earliest opportunity, their relationship was worthy of the greatest admiration and respect.' Mr Kendall had joined the BBC as a radio announcer before he became the first newsreader to appear in vision. He also featured in the Doctor Who serial The War Machines and had a cameo role as a newsreader in 2001: A Space Odyssey.","Mark Fear, 55, was found dead in the couple's home on the Isle of Wight .

In 2004 Samuel’s mother issued a public appeal for information urging her local community to turn in the killer. Mrs Thomson, then 35, said: 'This past year has been a living nightmare without Sam. 'The events of that afternoon will never go away and we are still living with the knowledge that no-one has been brought to justice for what they did to Sam. 'That day was so normal, I’ve lived here for 20 years and crossed that road a million times. We came out of the shop, looked left, looked right and set off. 'I was carrying my shopping in both hands but had the kids right next to me. The car came out of nowhere, it felt like whichever way we moved it went to same way. I felt completely helpless.

The authorities continue to clear away debris and fallen trees. A 17-year-old girl was among four people killed as hurricane-force winds battered England and Wales, leaving a trail of destruction. Dubbed St Jude after the patron of lost causes, the storm caused transport disruption on road, rail, air and sea, and power cuts for hundreds of thousands of homes. National Rail said it was not yet able to say how services will be affected today but urged travellers to check with their train operator, while ferry services from Dover are still delayed because of rough seas. The storm, which is now over Scandinavia, will today be replaced with far lighter winds and rain, but dozens of areas in southern England still remain on flood alert, The Environment Agency said. Insurers are counting the cost of the storm but say it is too early to tell whether it will compare with the multibillion-pound hits caused by previous severe weather events. Initial estimates of the level of financial damage wrought are not expected until later this week, the Association of British Insurers said.

A health care assistant and her lesbian partner have been jailed for fleecing three quarters of a million pounds from a wealthy elderly recluse. Celia Brinkley, 45, was sentenced to seven years in prison after stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds from 80-year-old Anthony Hornett while she was his home carer. Her partner Kerry Davies, 40, a qualified nurse, was also sentenced to 27 months in prison after admitting taking more than £80,000 of that sum from Anthony Hornett. St Albans Crown Court heard how the pair blew the pensioner's money on new cars, expensive trips and designer handbags  and told colleagues at St Albans City . Hospital that they'd won £250,000 on the lottery when questioned the pair on their luxury lifestyle. Judge Andrew Bright QC told the pair it . was difficult to imagine a greater or deeper breach of trust inflicted . on an elderly, vulnerable man. Behind bars: Health Care Assistant Celia Brinkley, 40, pictured left, and her lesbian partner, qualified nurse Kerry Davies, 40, pictured right, have both been jailed for fleecing vulnerable 80-year-old Anthony Hornett out of hundreds of thousands of pounds while they were his carers . Prosecutor Laura Blackband said the couple first met Mr Hornett in 2009 when he was in his late 70s. 'Mr . Hornett was very vulnerable and lonely. He had lived alone for many . years. He had never married and had no children. He was not visited by . relatives and was a recluse in reality,' she said. The court heard how the pair left their full-time jobs after Mr Hornett agreed to pay them £2,000 each a month to be his carers in August 2010. Brinkley would visit him twice a day and Davies just once a week. He owned three properties in St Albans and agreed to rent them one in Central Drive, which had been neglected, at a reduced price. Ms Blackband said: 'They agreed they would clean it. He would provide the white goods and would pay the council tax. The rent was £500 per month. The market rental would be £1,000. They had a very good deal.' They took over the property in June 2009 and moved in that September after cleaning it. But over the next few months, the court was told how they began fleecing money from Mr Hornett. Brinkley had access to his cheque book and forged eight cheques. She also used his Barclaycard. By June the following year, Brinkley had received £127,000 in cheques and Davies £40,000. The court heard £30,000 was spent on a VW Toureg for Brinkley and she also obtained a Mercedes convertible for £43,000 as well as a scooter. One text message Brinkley sent to Davies read: 'Sorry babe he will only give you £5,000 for your birthday.' Davies replied: 'I think that will do babe.' In fact Mr Hornett wrote a cheque for £7,000. The court heard the couple also believed they'd managed to dupe Mr . Hornett into changing his Will so they would inherit the house they were renting. Ms Blackband Mr Hornett had been plied . with drink and was persuaded by Brinkley to write a letter to his . solicitor changing his Will to leave them the house in Central Drive. In court: Sentencing at St Albans Crown Court, Judge Andrew Bright QC told the pair it . was difficult to imagine a greater or deeper breach of trust inflicted . on an elderly, vulnerable man . The elderly man’s solicitor contacted him because she was suspicious about the proposed change to his Will. It was not changed but Mr Hornett allowed the two women to continue to think they were his beneficiaries. As a result they planned £200,000 worth of extensions to the house in Central Drive. This was paid for by £300,000 they had amassed from their victim in a joint account. But the pair were caught when a policeman visiting Mr Hornett became suspicious about the building work. He also saw the two expensive cars. As a result the police obtained a Production Order from the court to look into the couple’s financial affairs and they were arrested. Inquiries were carried out and the total loss for Mr Hornett was put at £733,563.46. 'It was a staggering figure,' said Ms Blackband. In an interview with the police, Mr Hornett said he had become frightened of Brinkley, who the prosecutor said was 'the prime mover' in the fraud. On one occasion he said she became aggressive when he questioned the cost of a £10,000 boiler that she said needed installing in her home. He said it had been easier to give in to them. Brinkley, from Dellfield, St Albans, admitted two charges of fraud, nine of forgery and one of converting criminal property. Davies, also from Dellfied, St Albans, admitted one charge of converting criminal property. Terence Woods, defending Brinkley, said she had been in a relationship with Davies and they had been looking to move out of hospital accommodation. He said Brinkley and Davies were the only two people in the world who had cared for Mr Hornett who was an eccentric individual. Gideon Cammerman, representing Davies, said she had studied for a nursing degree at Sheffield University and had been an excellent nurse. 'She knows the Nursing and Midwifery Council will ensure she never works as a nurse again,' he told the court before adding that the relationship between the couple had come to an end. Judge Bright said: 'It is difficult to imagine a greater or deeper breach of trust inflicted on an elderly, vulnerable man. They were nursing staff in St Albans hospital - a job they gave up to live off the proceeds of crime.' He told Brinkley: 'You targeted him relentlessly, mercilessly and in a truly wicked way in a gross breach of trust over a considerable period.' He said she had 'milked him for every penny' she could. In sentencing Davies he said she had allowed Brinkley to do her 'dirty work' for her. A confiscation hearing will take place in January next year.","Health care assistant Celia Brinkley, 45, and her partner nurse Kerry Davies, 40, were employed by Anthony Hornett as his carers .

The four deaths yesterday followed that of Dylan Alkins, 14, on Sunday, who is presumed drowned after being swept away by 20ft waves while playing with friends in Newhaven, East Sussex. The search is continuing for the schoolboy today as friends hold an emotional vigil for him on the beach where he disappeared. Gutherie Freeman (right), Bethany's brother, has . also paid tribute to his sister (left) saying she was the best sibling he could . have asked for . Balloons with hand-written messages on them were released into the sky and flowers were thrown into the sea in memory of Dylan, described by friends as 'kind'. Some of those who gathered broke down in tears and hugged each other, while others paid tribute to the teenager. One of his friends, Aaron Gilbert, 15, said: 'I couldn’t believe it. 'I was hoping it was just a bad dream. I woke up crying. We would come down every day in the summer but I never thought he would come down when it was really rough. 'I wish I could have stopped him.' Hayden Hennessy, 14, showed off a bracelet which Dylan had given him as a gift. 'He gave me this bracelet and I only have this to remember him by,' he said. 'It makes me sad in a way.' He added: 'It just breaks my heart. I’m missing him.' Witnesses said that Dylan was among several teenagers who had been playing around on the beach as wind speeds were whipped up by the St Jude storm. Rescue teams, including a Coastguard helicopter and an RNLI lifeboat, scoured the area in what were described as 'atrocious conditions' with poor visibility on Sunday. But as time passed without finding Dylan, coastguards stood down their operation which has now shifted to trying to recover the teenager. Residents and business owners may face a second night in the dark after vast swathes of Britain suffered power outages. Tens of thousands of people remain without power while commuters faced further delays to their journeys as the disruption from St Jude - the most powerful storm to hit Britain in years - continued.

Engineers say they are often unable to give those affected an estimate for when they are likely to be re-connected. A spokesman said there were five times the normal number of engineers working to reinstate power, but said their main consideration was safety. Matt Rudling, director of services at UK Power Networks, said: 'We are working to restore all supplies as quickly and as safely as possible. 'A lot of hard work is going on round the clock, behind the scenes and we are making good progress with repairs.' Around half a million homes and businesses are thought to have been affected since the storm first touched the British mainland overnight on Sunday, with the South of England bearing the brunt. And while many train services have been reinstated following yesterday’s severely disrupted operations, rail users were still asked to check travel times as delays were reported.

An 'insanely jealous' boyfriend tried to fill his new girlfriend’s eyes and ears with Polyfilla in a week of sickening abuse. Levi Mason, 24, beat Jamie Gorman, his partner of just three months, with a broom and pressed a nine-inch knife against her thigh. He also threatened to pour acid over her face so that 'no-one else would ever want to get with her'. Mason, whose conduct was described by a judge as 'almost unbelievable', pressed his fingers against Miss Gorman’s windpipe and twice smothered the mum-of-one with a pillow, telling her: 'It’s horrible when you’ve got no control. Are you hot and bothered?' The thug was jailed for four years yesterday at Liverpool Crown Court. On handing out the sentence Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, the Recorder of Liverpool, told him: 'The physical injuries which were inflicted to Miss Gorman may not have been severe, but the mental anguish which you caused her cannot be imagined. 'The way in which you behaved during the course of that week defies humanity.' He added: 'You are a controlling bully and you used your size to instill fear into this woman.' The court heard how the the week of torture began at the home they shared in Birkenhead, in July. Michael Duncan, prosecuting, told how Mason began to get 'jealous and very aggressive'. He told the court how the abuse began when he took his partner’s phone and refused to give it back. A hearing at Liverpool Crown Court heard about the week of abuse, that Mason inflicted on his partner . Mr Duncan said: 'He got on top of her as she was lying on the bed. He put his legs either side, pinned her down so that she could not move. 'He pushed two fingertips on her windpipe, making it hard to breathe. 'She was struggling to get free. He then grabbed a pillow, placed it over her face and pushed it on to her. 'This induced a state of panic as she fought to breathe.' The court was also told how Mason held a lit cigarette close to Miss Gorman's skin before throwing it at her. Judge Goldstone said: 'She was too scared to call the police and over the next couple of days you behaved as if nothing had happened.' Two days later, after another argument, Mason poked her in the arm with a nail file and punched a door so hard it came off its hinges and then threw it. Then, after he tried to hit her with a picture frame, he struck her three times with a broom handle. Mason again smothered her with a pillow, 'laughing as she was screaming'. The catalogue of abuse included holding a bread knife to Miss Gorman’s face and a bowie knife to her thigh. Mr Duncan told how Mason also tried to put Polyfilla in her ears and eyes. Judge Goldstone said: 'To say you were jealous doesn’t do justice to the word. You are almost insanely jealous.' 'I am quite satisfied that you are quite capable of making life for a partner utterly miserable if she does not do your bidding.' Mason, of Bedford Road, Birkenhead, admitted seven counts of actual bodily harm. Gerald Pachter, defending, said Mason was remorseful and filled with 'shame and disgust'.","Levi Mason, 24, threatened his partner with a knife in week of abuse .

Warning: Home Secretary Theresa May said an independent Scotland would struggle to replicate the UK's intelligence network . An independent Scotland would face greater threats from criminal masterminds, international terrorists and online hackers, Home Secretary Theresa May has warned. A hard-hitting new report from the UK Government has raised the risk of ‘diminished security’ if Scots vote for separation in next year’s referendum. Mrs May said the network of agencies that protect British citizens – including MI5, MI6, GCHQ and the National Crime Agency – would remain with the rest of the UK, and Scotland would be frozen out. That would force Scottish ministers to start from scratch, but the SNP’s top-end projection of a £2.5billion budget for defence and security is less than the sum spent by Denmark and Norway on defence alone – and compares to £35billion spent every year across the UK. The Westminster report, the seventh in a series of 13 documents on the impact of a Yes vote, also warns that a separate Scotland would have no ‘automatic right to entry’ to key bodies such as the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence-sharing partnership between the UK, US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The paper warns that organised crime groups do not recognise borders, and law enforcement bodies currently work across the UK to tackle drug peddling and other illegal activities. Areas of expertise, such as the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, would not be available to an independent Scotland and a separate air passenger security regime would have to be set up. Scotland would also be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks unless it invests significant resources, which poses a huge risk for businesses. The report states: ‘The creation of an independent Scottish state will, without proper planning and investment, lead to a reduction in the capability of its government to protect Scottish interests, infrastructure and people from these threats. ‘A reduced capability to tackle a persistent threat would result in an increased risk to the Scottish people.’ The findings were backed by . former Labour Home Secretary Lord John Reid, but SNP MSP Christine . Grahame said the UK Government’s decision to ‘politicise issues of . security and anti-terrorism’ was ‘the height of irresponsibility’. Blair Jenkins, leader of the Yes Scotland campaign, complained that Mrs May was ‘talking Scotland down’. Threat: The Home Office report also warned cross-border policing would be mired in red tape and the fight against serious crime would be ¿undermined . A . separate Scotland would be forced to establish a network of specialist . bodies that are currently part of the UK’s new National Crime Agency. The Westminster government has . produced a list of 15 ‘capabilities’ that an independent Scottish . Government would ‘have to consider whether to invest or retain or . replicate’. The list includes the Missing . Persons Bureau, which is the UK’s national point of contact for all . missing people and unidentified body cases. An independent Scotland would also . lose access to the Financial Intelligence Unit that identifies . suspicious activity related to money laundering and terrorist financing. The Child Exploitation and Online . Protection Command organisation is another example, with the body . sharing 157 intelligence records with Scottish police chiefs in 2012. Other bodies on the list are the UK . National Central Office for Counterfeit Currency, the Human Trafficking . Centre, the Anti-Kidnap and Extortion Centre and the Illicit Laboratory . Team. But the Home Secretary said: ‘The national security risks the UK faces are complex and changing. Terrorists and organised criminals will seek new ways to exploit any weakness in our justice and policing capabilities, and the scale of emerging threats, such as cyber crime, demands a comprehensively resourced response.’ Mrs May rejected nationalist arguments that Scotland may face a diminished threat from terrorism by rejecting nuclear weapons and shunning ‘illegal wars’ such as the Iraq conflict. ‘There are those for whom it is not just country-specific because of foreign policy, or actions that have taken place, but there is an issue about the West and the way of life in the West,’ she said. ‘But what would change would be the scale of capability that Scotland would have access to.’ The UK's current intelligence and security network could not be easily divided and resources such as the £860million UK cyber security programme ‘would not be available to Scotland’, she said. Mrs May added: ‘Separate bits could not be hived off. This is one of the challenges, one of the hard issues that the SNP need to address.’ Former Home secretary Lord Reid said: ‘A separate Scotland would need to massively reduce security spending and operations from that of the UK, but the threat would not be commensurately reduced. ‘We would therefore be left with the same level of threat but with a much-reduced capacity to respond.’ But Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said: ‘These claims are wrong - not least because Scotland is already an independent jurisdiction when it comes to policing and justice issues, and current cross-border cooperation shows how well that can work to combat terrorism and other threats. ‘An independent Scotland will have first rate security arrangements to counter any threats we may face. And we will continue to work in very close collaboration with the rest of the UK and international partners on security and intelligence matters, which is in everyone's interests.’ Nationalist MSP Christine Grahame, who chairs Holyrood's justice committee, said: ‘The SNP has a record of delivering when it comes to policing and security and we will take no lessons from someone who has done so much to undermine this vital area south of the border.’ Blair Jenkins, chief executive of Yes Scotland, added: ‘As our nearest neighbours, we can expect a particularly close working relationship with the security services of the UK, to our mutual best interests.’","Home Secretary says Soctland would face greater threats from criminals .

Slicing through a spiral of azure blue water, these professional surfers look more like they have been caught in a washing machine than taking on the might of the Pacific Ocean. The extreme sportsmen were enjoying 'tow surfing', which enables surfers to chase down and catch giant waves using a boat to take them out to meet the biggest walls of water. However, the rushing water seemed to prove too much for record-breaking surfer Garrett McNamara as he took a tumble from his board while battling the waves off the coast of Tahiti, as captured in these dramatic photographs.

Rolling in the deep: Garrett McNamara, pictured, was one of the first to embrace Tow surfing, where boats enable participants to chase down seemingly impossible waves . The 45-year-old American big wave surfer is famous in the world of water-sports after he broke the record for the largest wave ever surfed, surviving a monstrous wave off the coast of Nazare in Portugal, and riding tidal waves from glaciers in Alaska. Mr McNamara was just one of the surfers who hit the waters of the French Polynesian coast for a free surf tow session, where boats are used to tow surfers out to sea and into a breaking wave, beyond where they would be able to paddle with their bare hands. Also enjoying the surf were Mr McNamara's fellow American Mark Healey, as well as French surfers Raimana Van Bastolaer and Manoa Drollet. The practice has been popular since the mid-1990s, although some critics and environmentalists dislike the noise and exhaust created by the tow vessels. Tahiti is a popular destination for thrill-seeking surfers, with the village of Teahupo'o particularly famous for its surf break and waves which can reach up to 21ft tall. It plays host to the annual Billabong Pro Tahiti surf competition and is part of the Association of Surfing Professionals world tour circuit. Beyond the sea: Surfers such as Garrett McNamara are towed into a breaking wave by a boat or other vessel, which allows them to take on larger waves than would be possible by paddling with their bare hands .

A bollard is thought to have caused damage worth 'hundreds of thousands of pounds' after being hit by dozens of drivers. Dubbed 'The Million-Pound Bollard', the piece of road furniture keeps traffic clear of the corner and protects pedestrians but is also continually being struck by cars and HGVs. To avoid the bollard, drivers in Merkinch, Inverness, must swing out on to the opposite side of the road, or they end up hitting it. Hazard: The bollard has been struck by dozens of drivers and is thought to have caused damage worth 'hundreds of thousands' In the way: Drivers are forced to veer on to the other side of the road as they try to avoid the bollard . Highland Council says it frequently has to send crews to reset the bollard and admits it has received damage claims from motorists. Many incidents are believed to go unreported however because drivers fear being hit with a bill to repair the bollard. 'It must have caused hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage,' said the Rev Richard Burkitt, who can see the bollard which sits outside his charity shop For The Right Reasons. 'Something needs to be done about it. I have certainly hit it myself and anyone visiting the area will as well. Close call: Highland Council admits it has received damage claims from motorists. 'You’ve got a problem that if you over-shoot the corner trying to avoid the bollard then you end up on the opposite side of the road. In fact just yesterday morning I was driving behind someone who hit it and didn’t stop. No one reports it because they fear they might have to pay to replace it. 'There is definitely a problem there with vehicles going up on to the pavement but the council needs to come up with a more imaginative solution. I don’t see why they keep putting it back up.' The bollard was installed after several lorries travelling down Nelson Street hit buildings while negotiating the corner. Councillor Richard Laird said he and the other central ward councillors had received complaints from constituents. Safety feature: The bollard was installed after several lorries travelling down the street hit buildings while negotiating the corner . He said: 'There is a traffic order proposed making it right-turn only for vehicles over seven-and-a-half tonnes. 'We will then see if a bollard is required. People have been hitting it for some time and it was put in as the junction is not quite safe. If lorries can hit a building down there then it is likely they could hit a child.' A council spokesman said it was considering junction improvements at Grant Street and Nelson Street costing £30,000. He was unable to say how much repairs to the bollard had cost or what had been paid out in damages.

Fed-up teachers at Cottesmore St Mary’s Catholic Primary School, in Hove, East Sussex, say the driver of the Honda CRV constantly parks on zigzags and double yellows. When challenged about her behaviour, the woman driver was allegedly 'unforthcoming and apparently somewhat rude', the newsletter says. Caught: Cottesmore St Mary¿s Catholic Primary School published this photograph of the car in its newsletter . The school decided to publish an image of the vehicle illegally parked alongside a polite request for drivers to be more considerate. The letter reads: 'It was reported, by a parent, that this car parks on the zigzags or the double yellow lines every day. 'Apparently, on Wednesday the lady car owner was asked to move off the zigzags pre-end of day pick up. 'She then apparently had moved onto the double yellow lines, making it difficult to turn the corner and thus making it dangerous for the children to cross the road. 'Apparently the lady driver was asked to move again by a parent but was unforthcoming and apparently somewhat rude. 'If this car belongs to you or someone you know, please do pass on our concerns about illegal parking and the impact it can have on the safety of our children.' A Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said he could not comment specifically on the incident at the school.

Necessary: Investigations are underway into how police officers dealt with Miriam Carey's driving rampage in Washington, DC on Thursday . Washington police will now investigate officers' use of force in killing Miriam Carey, the 34-year-old woman who tried to ram her car through a White House barrier on Thursday. Investigators will study the car chase and shooting and look into whether police officers took the right steps in stopping Carey's rampage, which briefly put the U.S. Capitol on lock down. So far, Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance Gainer believes that the officers 'did the best they could under the situation.' But Carey's sisters have both made statements expressing how they disagree. Her sister Valerie Carey, a retired New York City Police Officer, said there was 'no need for a gun to be used when there was no gunfire coming from the vehicle'. 'We're still very confused as a family why she's not still alive,' sister Amy Carey-Jones said in New York on Friday.'I feel like it's not justified, not justified.' Sgt Gainer says officers working at high-target buildings must make quick decisions to confront threats. 'This is not a routine highway or city traffic stop. It is simply not that,' Gainer said yesterday. 'The milieu under which we're operating at the United States Capitol and I suspect at the White House and at icons up in New York is an anti-terrorism approach, and that is a difference with a huge, huge distinction.' Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine was also happy with the way his officers acted under pressure, saying they were 'heroic' defending the Capitol. Speaking out: Miriam Carey's sisters- Valerie Carey (left) and Amy Carey-Jones- held a press conference near Amy's home in Brooklyn on Friday . Searching for answers: The sisters have said that they are awaiting the results of the investigation into the use of deadly force, saying that there should have been another way to stop Miriam during her car chase . Heartbreaking: Amy said that they spoke regularly and she knew that Miriam had been working closely with her doctors about tapering off the medication the prescribed for her post-partum depression . Carey was killed on Thursday after she . slammed into a Capitol Hill barricade following a police chase and it . was only after the officers approached the vehicle did they realize she . had her young daughter in the backseat. Witnesses . say Carey plowed through a temporary barrier and hit a Secret Service . agent who was trying to wave her off - sending him flying onto the hood . of her car. The Secret Service opened fire on her car as she turned and fled. The people who knew: Miriam's sister Amy Carey-Jones spoke to Anderson Cooper about the doctor's decision to taper her off medication he had prescribed for post-partum depression .

Officers can be heard shooting at her car as it drives off. Moments later, Carey was shot and killed - within sight of the Capitol Building, and just behind the U.S. Supreme Court. She was not armed. Questions: Sisters Valerie (left) and Amy . (right) said that there is no clear reason why Miriam drove down to DC . where she met her death on Thursday . Since . the shooting, police have revealed that Carey suffered from post-partum . depression following the birth of her now-18-month-old daughter, whose . name has not been released. After searching Carey's Stamford, . Connecticut home, police found files confirming her former mental . diagnosis, though the clearest reports come from the interview with the . victim's sisters. 'My . sister was not a bipolar schizophrenic individual. I can’t say as to why . she was in DC. Regardless as to why, she was in dc her life should not . have ended there,' Valery Carey, one of her sisters, told CNN. Amy . described the medical issues as something that was carefully monitored . by her doctors, who felt that she only needed to be on the medication . for a year following the initial diagnosis given her lack of any prior . issues. 'I just know that my sister did experience post-partum depression along with psychosis,' Amy said. 'She worked very closely with her doctor to taper her off the medication. 'It wasn’t something that was displayed- it was a momentary breakdown… She didn’t appear to be unstable. Investigation: A federal agent removes evidence from the apartment complex where Miriam Carey is believed to have lived in Stamford, Connecticut, this morning . 'There (were) not moments of her walking around with delusions- that's not what was going on. 'She . had her challenges as a new parent and I always spoke closely with . her,’ Amy said, describing those challenges as ‘nothing out of the . ordinary’. 'She seemed to be overwhelmed.' The . biggest question- why she did it- will be one that remains with family . members for the rest of their lives as Valerie Carey said that 'she was a . law-abiding citizen. She had no political agenda'. 'We will never know what Miriam was thinking in those last hours before she died. We can only speculate,' her sister Amy said. Miriam's boyfriend has told investigators that she feared her house was under surveillance by President Obama, though her sisters dispute that theory. 'What I can say is she has never disclosed of anything of that nature and since my sister is not here to speak for herself, that statement in itself is very questionable,' Valerie told Anderson Cooper during the Friday interview.","Police announced that they will be investigating officer's use of force against the woman who tried to ram her car through a White House barrier on Thursday .

A two-alarm blaze: Despite flames shooting into the air and his wife being dead, Mr Wright decided to go to a local bar . No one believed him: Patrons at Ann's Tavern joked with Mr Wright, and even bought him drinks, while his wife lay dead in the burning home . ‘Flames were shooting probably 10, 20 feet over top that roof,’ witness Maynard Honler told WNEP. Despite the raging fire, Mr Wright kept his tab open. About half an hour later, his sister showed up and told him to leave because his house was on fire. ‘You need to go now, your house is on fire,’ the bartender said the sister pleaded, he did not want to leave. A bouncer eventually forced him to go. Sitting in jail: Mr Wright is now sitting in jail after being charged with criminal homicide . A home destroyed: The charred shell of the home once shared by the couple . No sign of trouble: The couple never argued, there was no sign of trouble - now one half is dead and the other is in jail . Mr Wright, intoxicated when taken into custody, voluntarily confessed to killing his wife, according to the Williamsport Sun-Gazette. ‘I killed my wife,’ he said while being led to the bathroom, according to an affidavit cited by the paper. He was arraigned Saturday on one count of criminal homicide and is sitting in Lycoming County Jail, no bail is set for murder cases. Calls to Williamsport Police seeking comment were not answered. It is not clear how Mrs Wright was killed before the fire or died in the blaze, an autopsy is scheduled for Monday.","Michael Wright, 53, has been charged with criminal homicide in the death of wife Lynn Wright .

Electronic signs are to be put up on motorways to expose service stations trying to rip off motorists with inflated charges. They are part of a package of measures unveiled by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling today to reduce the cost of motoring. They include freezing the MoT test fee for a car at £54.85 until 2015,  and a review of the cost of taking a driving test and applying for a provisional licence. Eye-catching: Signs will be installed on motorways detailing the exact cost of petrol and diesel at different service stations on the route . In the most eye-catching move, high-tech signs will be installed on motorways detailing the exact cost of petrol and diesel at different service stations on the route. Ministers hope it will highlight the sums being charged by some garages that believe they have a ‘captive market’, and encourage them to compete for custom. A recent investigation by the Office of Fair Trading found that petrol at motorway service stations costs an average of 7.5p more per litre and diesel 8.3p more than at other garages. AA president Edmund King welcomed the new motorway signs, which will be trialled from next year, using wi-fi technology to update the cost of petrol on the route. Mr King said: ‘Motorists in the UK often think they are treated as a cash cow and these proposals go some way to help keep down the costs.’ There will also be an attempt to end fraudulent whiplash claims by forcing motorists to have their injury confirmed by a panel of independent medical experts. MPs have blamed the compensation culture driven by supposed whiplash injuries for driving up the cost of motor insurance premiums. Mr Grayling’s department, the Ministry of Justice, has introduced a string of measures to try to crack down on the number of claims. New signs: Drivers will be alerted to prices by high-tech signs along their route . Lawyers can no longer double their fees if they win, at the expense of defendants and their insurers. Ministers have banned ‘referral fees’ among lawyers, insurers, claims firms and garages for profitable cases. They have also reduced the fees lawyers can charge insurers for processing basic claims for compensation for minor injuries suffered in road accidents from £1,200 to £500. The AA says motor insurance premiums are falling at the fastest rate since 1994, dropping by 12.3 per cent in the year to October for an average comprehensive policy, from £648 to £568. The Ministry of Justice says the number of claims firms in the market has also fallen since the law changes, from a peak of 2,553 in December 2011 to 1,485 last month. The ministry said that despite these successes, whiplash claims remained an issue that the Government would continue to fight. Mary Creagh, the shadow transport secretary, said today’s announcements ‘will be cold comfort for motorists being squeezed on the road and at home’. She added: ‘Prices have gone up faster than wages in 39 of the 40 months [David Cameron] has been Prime Minister and working people are almost £1,500 a year worse off.’","Justice Secretary Chris Grayling unveils package of measures .

Innocent: Judges found that PC Kevin Peel's 'long and unblemished record' meant that they could not be certain he used excessive force in detaining the teenager . A police dog handler who was found guilty of kicking a school boy in the throat is celebrating after his conviction was quashed because of lack of evidence. PC Kevin Peel, 44, set loose his seven-stone German Shepherd, Oscar, which sank its teeth into the 15-year-old during a confrontation in a supermarket car park. The teenager claimed PC Peel kicked him on the waist and throat as the dog mauled him during a trial at Westminster Magistrates’ Court. He admitted being with a group of youths running away from officers near a branch of Sainsbury’s in Vauxhall, south west London in the early hours of July 17 last year. He was carrying a bag of bolt croppers and initially fled on his bike before he was apprehended by PC Peel and his colleagues. The boy, from Wandsworth, later accepted a caution for going equipped for theft. PC Peel, of Crawley, west Sussex told the court that he deployed Oscar because the boy appeared to be about to run off. The officer insisted he used ‘every ounce of strength’ to prevent the Oscar from biting again after he had pinned the teenager to the ground but struggled to control the animal. PC Peel said: ‘Because the boy was thrashing about and, as expected, shouting and screaming, it made it difficult for me to grab Oscar’s collar. ‘I am between Oscar and the boy because I would rather he bit me than the boy again. ‘All my dog really wanted to do is get past me to protect me’, PC Peel said. When asked if he deliberately kicked the boy, PC Peel replied: ‘Of course I didn’t. I find it extremely upsetting that I would be accused of that.’ Last month the officer was fined £500 for assault and ordered to pay costs of £500 with a £50 victim surcharge. But after hearing his appeal today, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith, sitting with two JPs at Southwark Crown Court, decided to quash his conviction. Judge Loraine-Smith said: ‘We found PC Peel an impressive witness with a long and unblemished record. ‘There is a mass of evidence for that for him to behave in this way was completely out of character. The question is, can we be sure that he used excessive force in carrying out that detention. ‘On the evidence we heard today, we don’t think we can be sure. The scene: PC Peel stopped the teenager in the early hours of July 17 last year, he was equipped with bolt cutters and later accepted a caution for being equipped for theft . ‘Accordingly we allow this appeal.’ Shaven headed and smartly dressed in a blue suit, Peel remained impassive as the ruling was passed but later grinned as he shook the hand of a colleague in apparent celebration. He refused to comment when approached after the hearing. Peel, of Crawley, West Sussex, had always denied assault. He was also acquitted of a public order offence in relation to allegedly calling the boy an offensive name at the trial in September this year.","PC Kevin Peel, 44, from Crawley, West Sussex, used police dog Oscar to prevent the 15-year-old from fleeing during a confrontation in a car park .

"By . Misty White Sidell . PUBLISHED: . 15:15 EST, 4 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:00 EST, 4 October 2013 . Tomorrow night’s House of Versace TV movie, starring Gina Gershon, has been famously met by contention from the Versace brand itself. Now, the film’s costume designer, Claire Nadon, has described the challenges she faced while outfitting Gershon as Donatella and staging four Versace fashion shows without use of the Versace archives. According to Nadon, ‘It was quite an adventure because the company didn’t help us at all in any way, even with archives or anything,’ she told MailOnline. Scroll down for video . Frank imitation: Actress Gina Gershon plays a remarkably convincing Donatella Versace in the new film . Nadon was responsible for bringing Donatella Versace’s signature platinum hair, tightly-fitted clothes, and heavily glossed pout to the small screen. The film, airing on the Lifetime network, stars Gershon as a rather convincing looking Donatella battling grief and a well-documented drug addiction in the wake of her brother Gianni’s tragic 1997 murder. Nadon was required to create an array of accurately Versace-inspired costumes to provide viewers with a proper look at the brand’s evolution. She had to devise an expansive wardrobe for Gershon’s character as well. From Donatella’s beloved stilettos, tight tops, and second-skin flared trousers, to the label’s many runway missteps and triumphs, Nadon essentially recreated the Versace story from thin air, only using eBay finds and reference photos as help along the way, she says. ‘We had to buy books and look on the Internet and try to find enough documents to base ourselves upon,’ Nadon said of House of Versace's costuming process. ‘I wanted to be as correct and close to the original as possible.’ Unauthorized: Versace says that a new Lifetime movie about Donatella Versace (pictured above) should be considered 'a work of fiction' But while Nadon’s efforts are . admirable, the film’s wardrobe shows how there is no true replacement . for atelier seamstresses and creative genius. With the exception of . Gershon’s wardrobe, House of Versace’s costuming offers a cheaper, . watered down version of Versace’s glamorous luster--the brand’s true . defining factor. A recreation of the colorful vinyl dresses worn by Christy Turlington, Stephanie Seymour, Nadja Auermann, Claudia Schiffer, and Cindy Crawford in Versace's famous 1994 ad campaign fall flat in a scene recounting the shoot's party atmosphere. Its costumes in no way embody the same sexed-up space age brilliance as those created under Gianni’s inimitable watch. 'Gina is thin, but not as thin as Donatella. We had four different corsets for her depending on the clothes she was wearing' There are also, unfortunately, many . failed attempts at recreating Versace’s signature gold damask print, as . Nadon was forced to find a copy due to the brand’s uninvolvement in the . film. (Nadon says ‘they were expecting a bigger budget and a bigger . star’) Nadon says that she worked on the film’s costumes for ‘twenty hours a day, seven days a week, for two months.’ She cut most of the costumes’ patterns and fabric herself (‘Of course we didn’t have the staff of the Versace house’, she said), and enlisted the help of four seamstresses to execute the wardrobe’s remaining technical labor. Gershon underwent 43 costume changes in the film, most of which required her to wear a corset in the vein of Donatella herself. ‘As [Donatella] got older she was even wearing corsets under pants and tops,’ Nadon said. ‘Gina is thin, but not as thin as Donatella. We had four different corsets for her depending on the clothes she was wearing.’ Task at hand: Nandon recreated four Versace fashion shows in the film with the help of four seamstresses . Gershon’s performance, laden with a soft . interpretation of Donatella’s heavy Italian accent, shows the iconic . designer in the irate throws of cocaine addition, taking . stealth helpings of the substance from a gilded keychain. Her drug-induced . angst, a byproduct of her brother Gianni’s murder, tarnishes her . business and personal relationships, which only recover after a stint in . rehab. It’s Gershon’s physical appearance that makes her on-screen role so convincing. Donatella’s signature glossy look is well articulated through expert hair, makeup, and styling. Recreating Donatella’s protruding pout was accomplished with a tiny cotton ball placed under Gershon’s lip. 'We didn’t want to show how much Donatella has worked on her face and how distorted she is now' ‘I’m pretty sure that Gina looks a lot better than the actual Donatella,’ Nadon told us. ‘We didn’t want to show how much Donatella has worked on her face and how distorted she is now.  We still wanted to appeal to the crowd, and didn’t want to make her look disgusting or disfigure her.’ On Thursday, the Versace brand issued a statement in anticipation of the film’s release. ‘Versace has neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever in the forthcoming TV movie about Mrs Versace,’ reads a statement issued to MailOnline. The House of Versace film (which begins in 1996 and culminates around 2005) is based on the 2010 book ‘House of Versace: The Untold Story of Genius, Murder, and Survival’ by Deborah Ball. The Versace brand says that ‘since Versace did not authorize the book on which [the film] is based, the movie should only be seen as a work of fiction."" Representatives for the Lifetime network refrained from offering a counter statement when reached by phone on Thursday evening. House of Versace’s backstory is very much rooted in facts. Versace has even confirmed her cocaine addiction and stint in rehab in a 2005 interview with Vogue magazine. All in the look: Gershon wore a tiny cotton ball under her lip to make her pout protrude like Donatella Versace . In that vein, Gershon does portray the public’s well-engrained perception of Versace’s platinum personality. It’s a singular stereotype that was first widely broadcast in the early aughts with Maya Ruldolph’s well-loved Donatella impersonation on Saturday Night Live. Donatella herself has called Rudolph’s impersonations ‘hilarious’, an interesting counterpoint to her brand’s opinion of House of Versace. But the two portrayals are not so different in their levels of contentious content. A 2003 SNL skit titled ‘Versace Halloween’ shows Rudolph’s Donatella handing out Ambien and cigarettes to trick-or-treaters. Her performance is weighted with the same cocaine, alcohol, and rage also found in Gershon’s more serious imitation. But the film falters at the hand of some historical inaccuracies. Most are courtesy of the script’s story-telling omissions. The film painstakingly details the Versace brand's many financial woes that erupted after Gianni Versace’s death, pointing to Donatella’s continuous strain of unrealized designs and excessive spending habits as the culprits. In doing so, the film makes it seem like Versace was a completely undesirable commercial entity for nearly a decade’s time. Backstage: The film shows Gershon's Donatella take over the family business after the murder of her brother . Donatella is shown presenting her first collection after Gianni’s death, one which received grave reviews. What follows is a mélange of Donatella’s drunken, cocaine-fueled rants and missteps. The audience only sees the negative falls of Donatella’s post-Gianni life, until she returns from rehab and presents the label’s fall 2005 collection, which drew positive criticism. 'Donatella’s many cartoonish media portrayals have not hindered her, or the Versace brand, in their present state' While the Versace brand did take a design nosedive following Gianni’s death, it was by no means the drawn-out atrocity that the film describes. A Style.com review written in 2000 calls Donatella’s Versace shows ‘the social event of the season in Milan.’ Her designs, while no longer the catnip of style savants and supermodels, still made noise on the red carpet (J.Lo’s plunging Tropicana moment comes to mind). The brand was not a critical success, but was still very desirable in the public mind. It's worth noting that Donatella’s many cartoonish media portrayals have not hindered her, or the Versace brand, in their present state. House of Versace ends around 2005, a time at which Versace found a reinvigorated foothold in the fashion industry. The brand has since continued to suffer from financial difficulties, and was even rumored for partial buy-out in 2012, but has flourished in the critical and cachet arenas. In 2009, Donatella hired then-emerging British visionary Christopher Kane to restart the house’s Versus diffusion line, as well as consult on the main Versace brand (Kane departed last year in order to focus on his own label when it received a major investment from Kering). New leaf: In the last five years Donatella Versace has expanded the Versace label's purview by relaunching Versus, as well as bringing Versace Atelier (pictured above) Kane, as expected, brought some much-needed added edge to Versace’s sexy, often too-sleek signatures. Following his departure, fellow British upstart J.W. Anderson took on the temporary reigns at Versus, the responsibilities of which will now be handed to a new designer each season (Anthony Vaccarello and singer M.I.A. are rumored for the house’s next choices). The house’s most recent accolade is a feature in Migos and Drake’s song titled ‘Versace’, which bluntly mention’s the brand’s name approximately 150 times in its lyrics. The track has become a meme amongst millennials, effectively skyrocketing the label’s profile into a new, highly-desirable genre. MailOnline even recently spotted ‘Versace’ repeatedly graffitied onto construction walls in New York’s typically more Ralph Lauren-inclined Upper West Side neighborhood. As House of Versace points out, it may have taken Donatella a bumpy ride to restore Versace to the glory days of Gianni’s influence. But it seems that now, more than ever, she is certainly on her way.","Costume designer Claire Nadon says that she 'didn't want to show how much Donatella has worked on her face and how distorted she is now'

A distraught husband has today demanded answers after discovering his wife of 29 years was buried in the WRONG grave, following a paperwork blunder. Devastated Mark Bowley spotted the error when he visited wife Peta's final resting place to lay flowers on her grave. Branding the mix-up a 'horrendous mistake', the 54-year-old said it was only when glancing at a nearby plot that he discovered the truth, seeing his wife's headstone adorning another grave. Devastated: Mark Bowley discovered his wife had been buried in the wrong plot at Fleetwood Cemetery when he visited to lay flowers on her resting place. He spotted her headstone adorning a different plot . Following Mrs Bowley's death on April 1, aged 52, her husband was told the family had been allocated grave number 67 at Fleetwood Cemetery in Lancashire. But, instead, the mother-of-three was laid to rest in plot 87 - the row in front of her intended final resting place, and the grave at which her grieving husband has been paying his respects for six months. The headstone was erected by Wyre Memorials on October 17, at plot 67 - following instructions given to them by Wyre Council, which operates the cemetery. Mr Bowley, from Thornton, said: 'It is an horrendous mistake that has devastated the family. 'On top of losing someone we love we are having to deal with this too.' Dignified: Peta Bowley died in April, two years to the day after the mother-of-three was diagnosed with cancer . Mrs Bowley, who worked for the family’s fish merchant business, died in April two years to the day after being diagnosed with cancer. Her husband added: 'I’d gone to the grave to make sure the flowers were OK, and I was looking around thinking the grass was getting a bit long. 'I just happened to notice Peta’s headstone had been installed on the wrong grave. I was devastated and couldn’t believe it.' As soon as the mistake was spotted the headstone was moved to the plot where Mrs Bowley was actually buried. Council bosses have since apologised to Mr Bowley, who was married for 29 years. They insisted it was an administration error and he had not been visiting an empty grave for the last six months. Mr Bowley added: 'My wife was very dignified and fought the disease, which started as breast cancer and unfortunately went on to be a brain tumour. 'I know she will be looking down on us now and smiling - she’ll be having a giggle about this. 'But I don’t want anyone else to suffer like we have done. 'I want to get to the bottom of exactly how this happened, and I have questions that I need answering. 'I want to know how this happened in the first place.' Apology: Wyre Council apologised for the paperwork blunder. Mr Bowley praised Wyre Memorials, who placed the headstone, under instruction from the council, for acting to move it immediately . Mr Bowley praised the response of Wyre Memorials for acting so quickly to rectify the mistake. He said: 'I was told that the last 30 years they had never come across this before. 'Wyre Memorials is in no way to blame for what happened. They literally went off the plans drawn up by the council.' John Wilson, owner of Wyre Memorials, of Fleetwood, said: 'I cannot imagine what that gentleman went through. To lose a wife at such an early age is so distressing. 'The realisation of seeing your wife’s name on a headstone is bad enough. 'As soon as we found out I straight away came to Fleetwood and we rectified things immediately.' A spokesman for Wyre Council said: 'The family has been correctly visiting the plot she was buried in, so there is no question of them paying their respects to an empty grave. 'A problem only occurred when the headstone was placed on the original plot because the paperwork was wrong. 'For this we hold our hands up and apologise but the stone was moved as soon as the mistake came to light and it was only in the wrong place for a few hours. 'We have always considered that grave to belong to Mrs Bowley and the correct paperwork has now been issued. 'As a result of the error, Wyre Council has changed working practices within bereavement services to prevent this happening again.'","Mark Bowley spotted the error when he went to lay flowers at the grave .

Senior detectives are investigating a mysterious house fire that killed a mother-of-two - just three years after she survived another blaze. Katrina-Rose Black, 21, who gave birth to her second child in February, was killed by flames that broke out at her home in Burnley at 11.30pm on Sunday night. Neighbours heard an explosion and ran into the street where they saw Miss Black at her first-floor bedroom window banging on the glass and pleading for help. Three fire engines were called to put out . the blaze, which blew the front door off its hinges, but they could not . save Miss Black. A post mortem examination found her death was 'unexplained', and the fire service could not find a cause for the fire. Today it emerged that neighbours rescued Miss Black from a blaze . in her previous home in February 2010. Two people poured water over Miss Black, then 17, as she lay unconscious, before taking her to hospital where she was treated for smoke inhalation. She recovered and police found the fire was not suspicious. However, after days of forensic tests, a Forces Major Investigations Team (FMIT) has been appointed to explore Sunday's blaze, which remains a mystery. Today, reports claim Miss Black had been involved in a dispute with a man for the past few months. The FMIT will now examine Facebook and text messages sent between the pair. According to local media, a man sent her a Facebook message in August saying: 'Rosie . please unblock me im sorry for the messages I was very drunk last night . how am I supposed to get intouch with u if I need u about anything.' A post mortem examination on Miss Black's body, removed from the property at around 3pm on Monday, did not determine a cause of death, although it ruled out rumours she was pregnant with her third child. Forensic investigators combed the terraced house in Hapton, near Burnley, removing a door and other items for testing. Horrific: The front door was blown off its hinges in the house fire at 11.30pm on Sunday . During the fire, smoke was seen billowing from the house before the door was blown off its hinges. A witness said: 'One of the neighbours heard an explosion. They said they saw a girl up at the bedroom window but she couldn’t smash the window. 'There was a man on the street saying ""she’s upstairs and the house is on fire"". 'Everyone came out of their houses and were telling her to smash the window and jump out but she couldn’t. It was a terrible scene. 'It was the early hours of Monday morning when we saw the ambulances and blue lights.' Tributes: Flowers were left outside the house of mother-of-two Miss Black, who gave birth in February . The neighbour added: 'She was a smiley girl, she used to speak . to my my mum and then when she passed away Rosie came over to pass on . her condolences. She was a caring girl. 'She had a little one but I wouldn’t see him often, I did see her with another child. A man used to come and go - but I don’t know if he lived there. 'She had asthma, it must have been quite bad - one time paramedics were called to her house.' Another neighbour said: 'My brother said he had heard banging and then her screaming and that’s when he called the emergency services. It’s just shocking that a young girl could die like this.' A third said: 'When we heard the sirens, we just thought it was a chip pan fire and it would get dealt with in half an hour. Investigation: A Major Investigations Team is looking into claims she was feuding with a man . 'Most of the street were out when I came outside. I could not believe how bad it was. 'I don’t know how the firefighters could go in, it was so intense. The flames were coming out of the windows. 'We waited and thought we would see a rescue, but nobody came out.' Lancashire Police said: 'The death is . being treated as unexplained because we do not know how the fire . started. The fire has caused extensive damage to the house and an . investigation is now underway to establish what happened. 'A team of officers are working on the investigation, including officers from the Force Major Investigation Team.' A spokesman for Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'The cause is the fire currently unknown and a joint investigation between us and the police has been launched.'","Katrina-Rose Black, 21, died in the fire 8 months after birth of second son .

An £11,000-a-week former Premier League footballer intervened in a row between his girlfriend and alleged lover and broke a New Year’s Eve reveller’s cheekbone, a court heard today. Nottingham Forest striker Darius Henderson, 31, was seeing in New Year 2011 with girlfriend Lucy Caplan when Hazel Kent allegedly confronted him at Darcy’s restaurant in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Miss Kent, 48, claimed she and Henderson, who now plays for the Championship team, had recently met for sex - even describing the brand of boxer shorts he wore and the inside of his home. In court: Nottingham Forest footballer Darius Henderson (left) is accused of breaking the jaw of John Bell (right) John Bell, 42, who had been dining with his partner John Lavelle and some friends at a nearby table, tried to calm down the footballer - but Henderson lashed out, St Albans Crown Court was told. He allegedly punched Mr Bell so hard it fractured his cheekbone and damaged his eye socket. Mr Bell’s injuries were so serious he had to have surgery and now has titanium plates in his face. Henderson - who played for Millwall in south-east London at the time and has also been at Sheffield United, Watford, Reading and Swindon Town - is on trial charged with grievous bodily harm. Opening the case, prosecutor Alan Richards said: ‘This case concerns an unfortunate incident at the end of a long and generally pleasant night in St Albans. ‘Mr Henderson, who is a professional footballer, was out with his girlfriend Lucy Caplan. They ate together at Darcy’s restaurant, then went through to the bar to see the New Year in. ‘Mr Bell was out with his partner John Lavelle and two female friends. The two groups had little contact with each other... everything was perfectly convivial between them. ‘In fact none of the parties were responsible for sowing the seeds of tension that night. Another person, Hazel Kent, was in the restaurant. ‘For reasons best known to herself, she behaved somewhat unpleasantly to Mr Henderson and Miss Caplan, asserting on more than one occasion, that she had recently had sex with Mr Henderson. ‘She asserted that she could describe Mr Henderson’s home to establish the truth of her assertions - it seems she may have correctly identified that brand of boxer shorts. ‘Understandably this upset Miss Caplan and caused some tension between her and Mr Henderson. Equally understandably Mr Henderson was keen that Miss Kent should leave him and Miss Caplan alone. Location: Darius Henderson, 31, was seeing in New Year 2011 with girlfriend Lucy Caplan when Hazel Kent allegedly confronted him at Darcy's restaurant in St Albans, Hertfordshire . ‘There is no reason to believe that this was anything other than pure fiction, but Miss Kent persisted.’ Jurors heard Mr Bell tried to step in to calm things down. But then Henderson, of Markyate, Hertforshire, allegedly punched him twice in the head. Mr Richards said: ‘It is possible that his intervention caused Mr Henderson, who was already upset and angered by Miss Kent’s behaviour, to perceive Mr Bell as somehow associated with her. ‘What is absolutely clear, say the . prosecution, is that Mr Bell posed no threat to Mr Henderson whatsoever. Even if his intervention was unwelcome it could not even begin to . justify what he did. '(Darius) Henderson punched Mr (John) Bell in the head twice. It may be the first blow did not connect but the second certainly did and Mr Bell was knocked to the floor' Alan Richards, prosecuting . ‘He punched Mr Bell in the head twice. It may be the first blow did not connect but the second certainly did and Mr Bell was knocked to the floor.’ The attack was captured on the restaurant’s CCTV and 6ft 4in Henderson was arrested at the scene. In the footage Mr Bell was seen chatting to Henderson at the bar after Miss Caplan walked off. Some jurors gasped as they watched the video of Henderson punching Mr Bell twice after appearing to stumble off his seat. In an interview Henderson told police he thought Mr Bell was going to hit him. Mr Richards told a jury of eight men and four women: ‘Mr Henderson’s case was, as it remains, that he perceived Mr Bell to pose a threat to him so he hit first in self-defence. ‘The law does allow for pre-emptive strikes to be launched in self-defence but the prosecution say that is simply not the truth of what happened here. ‘If there can be an explanation of Mr Henderson’s behaviour, the Crown submits it lies in his anger and frustration at what happened earlier in the evening, which was not of Mr Bell’s making. Hearing: St Albans Crown Court (pictured) was told John Bell, 42, who had been dining with his partner John Lavelle and some friends at a nearby table, tried to calm the footballer down - but Henderson lashed out . ‘Even if that goes someway to explaining why Mr Henderson acted as he did, it cannot and does not excuse it.’ Giving evidence, Mr Bell said he could not remember anything after 11pm. He told jurors: ‘The next thing I remember is being in Watford A&E having a brain scan.’ Prior to that, he said: ‘I remember talking to Lucy outside at about 9pm. I asked her for a cigarette. ‘She said she had hair extensions and . asked if they looked alright. She said she was with her partner, who she . said was an athlete, and showed me a nice bracelet she was given for . Christmas.’ 'Do you recollect a conversation with Mr Henderson in which you suggested Millwall Football Club were s***?' Sean Minihan, defending . 'No, I don’t follow football' John Bell . Henderson’s lawyer Sean Minihan accused Mr Bell of antagonising his client prior to the alleged assault at around 1.30am.

He continued: ‘Any recollection of asking Mr Henderson to apologise to a woman and threatening him?’ ‘No,’ Mr Bell said. Mr Minihan asked: ‘Do you know what bottling means? Any recollection of making that threat?’ ‘No,’ Mr Bell replied. Restaurant manager Anna Iwanicka said Miss Kent, 48, was being very loud in the bar area before tearing into Henderson. She said: ‘The way she was speaking I think she wanted to be heard. I don't know what she was saying exactly.

He then gave him another punch and I saw blood and Mr Bell went down on the floor.’ The court heard Henderson and Miss Caplan are now no longer together.

A war memorial has been vandalised just two weeks before Remembrance Sunday after thieves broke open a collection box to steal just a few coins. The vandals caused £400 worth of damage to the RAF memorial in Lytham St Anne's, Lancashire by using an angle grinder to get into the box. The theft follows a spate of vandalism at war memorials carried out by unscrupulous criminals across the country who sold off metal plaques and statues to scrap dealers. Vandalism: This collection box in a war memorial in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire was cut open by thieves . Note: This hand-written message was left on the memorial by volunteers as an apology to visitors . Volunteers at the . Second World War memorial visited the site on Saturday morning to find . that the collection box which is built in to the structure had had its . door sawn off and its contents emptied. Fundraisers . have now launched a campaign to find those responsible, and have left a . hand-written note apologising for the damage, which will cost £400 to . repair. It reads: . 'Temp[orarily] out of order due to mindless thieves who felt their need . for a few pennies was greater than the need to remember the RAF war . dead. We will fix ASAP. Thanks for your support.' The . collection box was set into a display made from an antique bomb - it is normally . emptied every day, but last week it was not checked between Thursday . and Saturday thanks to inclement weather. Commemoration: The memorial recognises the contribution made to the Second World War by the RAF . Heartless: The vandalism, which will cost £400 to repair, came two weeks before Remembrance Sunday . The RAF Fighter, Bomber and Coastal Command memorial also features a replica Spitfire, which was not damaged by the theft. Police are investigating the incident and reviewing CCTV footage in an attempt to catch the thief, who struck two weeks before the Remembrance Sunday commemoration on November 10. The culprit will have been able to take no more than a small amount of change, according to the memorial fund's chairman, John Coombes. 'The repair costs will have to come out of the memorial funds, which we are currently collecting for a memorial garden,' he said. Patched up: The collection box has been targeted by thieves at least twice before . Fury: John Coombes, chairman of the memorial fund, has hit out at the vandals . 'This is a crime not only against our members but against the whole community, because it is the community which will suffer from the lack of improvement to the park around our memorial. 'These people have cost us £400 for a handful of coppers. It's like pinching a Poppy Appeal collection box - it's exactly the same lowlife thing to do.' The collection box has previously been targeted - shortly before the memorial officially opened in May, vandals damaged the box by kicking it, while a few weeks ago someone tried to take the lock off the box. Mr Coombes said: 'Whoever went down there went equipped to get inside, and it must have taken some time to get in. 'I'm amazed no one has come forward to say they heard or saw something.' Historic: The thieves apparently had no regard for the sentimental importance of the memorial . Previous thefts from war memorials have often been blamed on the high value of scrap metal. In June this year, a statue of a soldier which stood atop a memorial to casualties of the First World War in Fife was taken and apparently sold. And shortly before the last Remembrance Sunday, a plaque bearing the names of fallen war heroes was stolen from a memorial in Essex. In 2012, an undercover investigation by the Daily Mail revealed that many scrap metal dealers are willing to buy plaques and similar objects even when told they were stolen from memorials.","Vandals took change from collection box in Lytham St Anne's memorial .

"By . Harry Mount . PUBLISHED: . 20:19 EST, 28 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:28 EST, 29 October 2013 . How many Government schools inspectors would approve of a half-naked teacher who instructed his pupils in the finer points of anarchic terrorism? That was the approach taken by Jim Cogan, an English teacher at my old school, Westminster, in the Eighties. Mr Cogan, who had done his National Service in Nigeria with the West African Frontier Force, liked to teach outside, often stripped to his vest. Privileged: Harry Mount claims Nick Clegg, who attended Westminster school in the 1980s, owes his success to his teachers, most of whom had no formal teaching qualification . On sunny summer days, he marched the class to the boundary of the cricket pitch in nearby Vincent Square, asking pupils to compose an instant essay on ‘How cricket is like life’. Cogan was a Shakespeare scholar, expert at guiding pupils towards Oxbridge with his vast memory bank of quotes from English literature. At the same time, he told his pupils that all Oxbridge colleges should be blown up, to end the wicked class divide. If Jim Cogan’s old pupil, Nick Clegg, had his way, this maverick genius wouldn’t have been allowed to give 35 years of his life to inspiring Westminster pupils. Mr Cogan studied classics and English at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, but he never got the formal teaching qualification Clegg insists all teachers at free schools must have. Barely any of the gifted teachers who taught me and Nick Clegg — I was four years below the Deputy Prime Minister — had a teaching qualification. As a result, our elite education was blissfully free from the blunt, oafish, centralised government intervention Clegg is demanding for less privileged children. Nick Clegg wasn’t one of the more intelligent boys when he was at Westminster School from 1980 to 1985. 'He was a genius who taught for the love of his subject' The clever pupils at Westminster — one of the best, and most expensive, schools in the country, costing £32,490 a year — were ‘accelerated’. That meant they did O-levels after two, as opposed to three, years. Clegg, one of the less bright sparks, was selected for the three-year option. Still, that didn’t stop him making it into Robinson College, Cambridge, in 1986, and, from there, on to the smooth-running conveyor belt to life’s glittering prizes: a scholarship at Minnesota University, an MA at the College of Europe in Bruges, a job with the European Commission and a spell as an MEP, before becoming an MP. None of this would have been possible without the rocket-boosters attached to his middle-ranking talents by Westminster’s teachers. I was largely taught by the same teachers — they stayed at the school a long time, attracted by the freedom to teach in the way they wanted, not hamstrung by the foot-dragging, equality-obsessed, knowledge-hating forces of the State education machine. They taught for the love of their subject and were restricted neither by any national curriculum — which Clegg is also insisting all free school teachers must follow — nor much of a school curriculum. That day’s topic could be changed on the spot. Mount says new rules would drive free-thinking, inspirational teachers away from state schools and into private ones such as Westminster (pictured) I remember the assassination of Indira Gandhi, India’s Prime Minister, in October 1984. I was 13, in my first term, and our English teacher, David Edwards, decided on a whim to devote the lesson to studying her legacy rather than reading Julius Caesar, our O-level set book. Of course, we’d end up reading Julius Caesar and doing well in those exams, but only as a sideshow in the general mission to enjoy literature; not as the be-all and end-all of the two years of lessons — or, in Clegg’s case, three years — leading to our O-levels. The teachers used a deft combination of carrot and stick. David Hepburne-Scott — an Old Etonian who taught physics to me and Clegg and was rarely seen without his Eton tie — could be terrifying. But his  lessons were wonderfully original. He taught the physics of heat transfer by telling us that, to warm up a cold bottle of red wine quickly before a dinner party, we must stick it behind the fridge — where warm air is expelled. In the same lesson that he taught us Bernoulli’s principle — which explains why aeroplanes fly — he also told us how to fold our jackets before putting them in a suitcase: turn one arm inside out, fold once vertically, then again horizontally. I still do it today on holiday — and I remember Bernoulli’s principle, too. Hepburne-Scott also had an uplifting disregard for petty rules. On a trip to a railway museum, he jumped into the cab of a stationary locomotive, beckoned a group of boys aboard, and headed, steaming, off into the sunset. 'My other maths teacher, Tristram Jones-Parry, a planet-brained mathematician, tried to teach at a State school when he left Westminster and was denied a job because he wasn't 'qualified""' My maths teacher, Michael Hugill, taught statistics by comparing the length of words used by the novelists Anthony Powell and Evelyn Waugh in 100-word extracts from their books. Tellingly, my other maths teacher, Tristram Jones-Parry, a planet-brained mathematician, later the headmaster, tried to teach at a State school when he left Westminster — and was denied a job because he wasn’t ‘qualified’. His old pupil, Nick Clegg, must have been delighted. Jones-Parry was formidable figure. He once bellowed at the young Helena Bonham Carter, who took her A-levels at Westminster: ‘You can’t dress up as if you’re about to go out and milk the cows!’ Richard Stokes, Clegg’s German teacher — last year awarded the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for ‘great service rendered to British-German relations’ — taught his subject through German poems set to music by Schubert and Mozart. Stokes was another ‘untrained’ but inspirational man who admitted that while at Oxford, he’d get one of the girls from Somerville College to check his translations which were always littered with ‘howlers’. Of course, Westminster in the Clegg years wasn’t a sepia-tinted paradise, with a common room entirely populated by adored Mr Chips types. As in any school, some of the teachers weren’t much good. Free schools, like private schools, currently don't require teachers to take a formal qualification before joining the staff . And it helped that the pupils were from comfortable, middle-class backgrounds, often with book-lined drawing rooms at home. It helped, too, that practically all the teachers had been to Oxbridge. Still, that doesn’t mean less privileged children wouldn’t benefit from the teaching techniques that sent droves of Westminster pupils to Oxbridge and professional careers. Wicked, patronising critics insist State schools can’t follow the same methods that make private schools the best in the world. 'Talented, free-thinking, unqualified teachers will desert free schools and flock to private ones.' And Nick Clegg isn’t alone in denying poor children the advantages he benefited from by an accident of birth. Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt — son of a peer, educated at fee-paying University College School and Trinity College, Cambridge — insists teachers must have qualifications, even though he has taught in schools in his Stoke constituency without one himself. Clegg and Hunt come from a long line of privately educated, Left-wing politicians, who pull up the drawbridge behind them. Shirley Williams, Education Secretary under James Callaghan, was beautifully educated at St Paul’s Girls’ School and Somerville College, Oxford, but was determined to get rid of private and grammar schools. Anthony Crosland (Highgate School and Trinity College, Oxford), Harold Wilson’s Education Secretary, famously said: ‘If it’s the last thing I do, I’m going to destroy every f***ing grammar school in England. And Wales and Northern Ireland.’ Who wouldn’t want to be free of their hypocritical grasp? The idea behind Michael Gove’s free schools is they should be  free, if not entirely independent, of the dead hand of Government. But Nick Clegg is trying to keep a Government grip on them, keep them attached to what Michael Gove calls ‘the blob’ — the immovable, stodgy mass of the State-education establishment. The result? Talented, free-thinking, unqualified teachers will desert free schools and flock to private ones. Westminster’s teachers were brilliant because they were free from State indoctrination, free from a Government curriculum, free from the dim limitations of groupthink. Free, too, to scream at, expel or suspend anyone they wanted. And they haven’t been on strike in 453 years. Harry Mount is a tutor and teaches architectural history at a London art school. He doesn’t have a teaching qualification.","Harry Mount went to same private school as Nick Clegg .

England's rugby World Cup hero Jonny Wilkinson has married his long-term girlfriend Shelley Jenkins in a ‘secret’ ceremony in the south of France. The 34-year-old, his bride, and just two guests attended the private wedding at the town hall in the Riviera resort of Bandol on Monday. Local mayor Christian Palix, who officiated, confirmed it was a ‘small, intimate affair’, saying Wilkinson was ‘an iconic figure in the sporting world and someone with great human qualities’. Married in secret: Jonny Wilkinson has wed long-term girlfriend Shelley Jenkins in a ceremony in the south of France attended by only two guests. Here the couple are pictured at Zara Phillips wedding in 2011 . No fuss: A source involved in the wedding said it was carried out in utmost secrecy . The couple met in 2005, just after Wilkinson split from Sky Sports presenter Diana Stewart. It was just two years after Wilkinson became a national hero when he scored the last minute drop goal against Australia which made England world champions. Miss Jenkins, a scaffolding company heiress, had been working as a waitress in a cocktail bar in Magaluf , Majorca, with her twin sister Tracey. Wilkinson and his new wife have been together ever since, and she moved to France with him when he joined Toulon in May 2009 after 12 years with Newcastle. The couple enjoy a holiday in Majorca. Miss Jenkins had been working as a waitress in a cocktail bar on the island when they first met . Wilkinson’s wedding came just two days after Toulon lost a crunch game to Toulouse 13-12, and the fly-half missed three kicks at the end. But there was no sign of him being downhearted at the event, with Mr Palix saying: ‘I wish them great happiness in our town and to symbolize this great happiness, I offered them an olive. ‘This is because an olive is a symbol of happiness, and because Jonny Wilkinson is not a man who drinks alcohol, not even Bandol (the wine),  so the olives are preferable to grapes’. Another source involved in the wedding said : ‘It was all carried out in conditions of utmost secrecy. They are a lovely couple who did not want to make a fuss. Historic moment: Wilkinson kicks the winning drop goal in Sydney in November 2003 to help England lift the Rugby World Cup . In action: Wilkinson playing for Toulon during a Heineken Cup pool match last week against Cardiff . Both Wilkinson and his new wife, 33, are well known in and around Toulon, where they are ‘both viewed with great respect’, said Mr Palix. The couple have both done their best to learn French and enjoy the Gallic pace of life. When he first moved to France, Wilkinson said he wanted to concentrate on getting his work-life balance right, explaining: ‘I was attracted by the beauty of so many new experiences – new team, new language, new region, living like that.’","Ceremony at town hall in Bandol was attended by just two guests .

David Cameron’s favourite curry house has been busted for employing illegal immigrants. Border officials raided The Shaan restaurant in Witney, Oxfordshire, earlier this month and arrested three Bangladeshi men who will now be deported from the UK. The restaurant proudly displays a picture of Mr Cameron posing with staff members in its window, and snaps of him dining with his wife and children on its website. Hot stuff: David Cameron pictured with his wife Samantha and their children at The Shaan in Witney . Surprise: The manager of The Shaan said that the arrests had come as a shock to the rest of the staff at the restaurant which has been open since 1999 . It also has a picture of his dedication in the visitor’s book. In June 2010, just weeks after the General Election, Mr Cameron wrote: ‘Thank you for a delicious meal - lovely to be back.’ The restaurant is on Corn Street, around the corner from Mr Cameron’s constituency office.Abdul Chowdhury, (corr) the manager of Shaan, said he had checked the documents of the three employees when he interviewed them and thought they were in order. He said the Camerons gave their compliments to the chef after their last visit before Christmas and promised to return as soon as they had time. Mr Cameron’s favourite dish at the Shaan was said to be the chicken rogan josh which costs just £5.95. Mrs Cameron had the taaka dhaal for £3 and the total bill came to £55. Mr Chowdhury said: ‘He really enjoyed his food and said we are his favourite Indian restaurant in the area. ‘We were very pleased to have our Prime Minister in our restaurant. ‘He was kind enough to have his photographer take a picture of him with our staff and sent us six copies in the post.’ He told the Mail the Prime Minister had visited the restaurant three times including on the night of the 2010 poll. The manager said that the arrests had come as a shock to the rest of the staff at the restaurant which has been open since 1999. He said: ‘I had interviewed the men and checked their passports and references and thought everything was in order. ‘We will have to wait and see what the UKBA investigation finds.’ The restaurant could now face a fine of up to £10,000 for each illegal worker. Border officials said one of the men, aged 21, had overstayed his visa while the other two, aged 28 and 35, had entered the country illegally. 'Lovely to be back: Cameron signed the visitor's book thanking staff for 'a delicious meal' at the restaurant where reportedly enjoys chicken rogan josh . The raid took place at 8pm on Friday October 18, as stunned diners looked on. A Home Office spokesman said the three men were in immigration detention pending their removal from the UK. Paul Smith, from the Thames Valley and Surrey Home Office immigration enforcement team, said: . ‘The message to employers in Oxfordshire who choose to use illegal labour is clear. We will catch you and you will face a heavy penalty. ‘Illegal working has a negative impact on communities. It defrauds the taxpayer, undercuts honest employers and cheats legitimate job seekers out of employment opportunities. ‘I would urge members of the public with information about suspected immigration abuse to get in touch.’ The restaurant has a five star food rating from the local council and offers a ten per cent discount on takeaway orders over £12. A chicken tikka masala costs £6.50. Restaurant owners have complained of severe shortages of curry chefs as a result of the Government’s tightening of immigration rules.

But before all the gas had escaped, McStay lit a cigarette, sparking an explosion which blew the roof off his upstairs flat and causing £270,000 of damage. He suffered catastrophic burns all over his body, spent three months in a coma, 12 months in hospital and has had 30 operations to date. Newcastle Crown Court heard how residents living in the flat beneath McStay were fortunate not to be killed in the huge explosion. McStay has now been jailed for 27 months after pleading guilty to arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered. Sentencing him, Judge Jeremy Freedman said: 'It was your intention to take your own life but you thought better of it and you opened the window and somewhat naively believed the gas would then escape. 'What you then did, as an act of folly, is light a cigarette and the inevitable happened. There was what can only be described as a massive explosion. 'There could have been three fatalities here. Your downstairs neighbour, his son and you were lucky to escape alive.' The father and son living in the downstairs flat on Sceptre Street, Elswick, Newcastle, were woken by a huge bang in the early hours of the morning in September 2011. They ran into the back garden and discovered a scene of destruction. Explosion: A court heard McStay filled his home with gas before blowing it up, causing £270,000 of damage, pictured above. McStay claims he changed his mind after releasing the gas and had opened the windows but then lit a cigarette before it had all cleared which sparked the explosion . Michael Bunch, prosecuting, said: 'They could see flaming items falling in the yard, which was full of bricks and rubble. 'When they looked up they could see the roof and wall from the defendant’s flat had been blown off. 'The defendant was crouching down in the area where his kitchen had been. 'He shouted: ""I’ve blown myself up"", and had suffered horrific burns.' McStay suffered burns over 65 per cent of his body and was a hospital in-patient for a year. He has been left horribly scarred. Dangerous: Newcastle Crown Court heard how residents living in the flat beneath McStay were lucky to escape the blast alive . The court heard the flat downstairs and . properties to the side in the terraced block were damaged in the . explosion and the total repair bill was £270,000. McStay, of The Hawthorns, Elswick, Newcastle, who has convictions for 27 previous offences, pleaded guilty to arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered. Paul Caulfield, defending, said: 'The explosion for him has been catastrophic. 'He was in a coma for three months, his heart stopped three times and he has had 30 operations, with more to come. 'His hands are clawed and virtually useless, his feet are extremely badly damaged and he is on heavy pain killers and has not slept properly for two years. He has served the equivalent of a two year prison sentence during his time in hospital.'

Mike Tyson has revealed that he is on the verge of dying from alcohol and drug abuse after years of lying about being sober. The former heavyweight champion made the startling revelation while at a press conference to promote ESPN's Friday Night Fights at the Turning Stone Resort in Verona, New York on Friday. 'I'm a bad guy sometimes,' he said. 'I did a . lot of bad things, and I want to be forgiven... I wanna change my life, I wanna . live a different life now. I wanna live my sober life. 'I don't wanna . die. I’m on the verge of dying, because I’m a vicious alcoholic.' Scroll down for video . Revelations: Former boxing champ Mike Tyson revealed at a press conference on Friday that he is on the 'verge of dying' as he struggles to kick his alcohol and drug addictions . Progress: He added that he has not taken drugs or alcohol in six days, which he called 'a miracle' After realizing what he had shared, he paused before adding that he has not consumed alcohol or drugs in six days, which he called 'a miracle'. 'I've been lying to everybody else that think I was sober, but I'm not,' he admitted. 'This is my sixth day. I'm never gonna use again.' Tyson's struggle with alcohol and drugs has been well documented; he has been in and out of rehab three times. He has also admitted that around five years ago he was contemplating suicide and overdosing - just before his four-year-old daughter Exodus died on May 26, 2009 when she was strangled by a cord while playing on a treadmill. He said that the tragedy served as a wake up call. 'I didn't think I'd be here much longer,' Tyson said. 'I . was planning on killing myself. I was overdosing every night. I . couldn't believe it - that I was waking up. Living life is different for . me. Glory days: He is pictured landing a punch on Larry Holmes in January 1988 during a heavyweight title boxing fight in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He has been in and out of rehab since . 'I had to change my life. It's been hell, but I'm happy to be alive.' In an interview with Nightline in July 2012, Tyson claimed he had been sober for three years. Apology: He made the comments as he spoke of former trainer Teddy Atlas. They fell out in the 80s . 'I'm just constantly working on turning. It doesn’t happen overnight,' Tyson said in the interview. 'I may have a good few years in me but it's still not out of me. You still have to work consistently. Every moment of the day you have to work because your demons always - that's who you are.' His comments on Friday came as he spoke about trying to make amends with Teddy Atlas, his former trainer whom he famously fell out with in the early 1980s. Tyson said he knew Atlas was going to be at the Fight Night Fights event and described how he initially struggled with how he would handle seeing him again. 'I didn't have a good thought in mind . about that at first, because I'm negative and I'm dark,' Tyson said. 'And I wanna do bad stuff. I wanna hang out in this neighborhood alone . [pointing to his head]. 'That's dangerous to hang out in this neighborhood alone up here, right? It wants to kill everything. It wants to kill me, too.' He added of Atlas: 'He has to know this is sincere. I don't wanna fight you no more. I was wrong. I'm sorry.' Last . month, Tyson announced he's teaming with director Spike Lee to bring . Tyson's one-man Broadway stage show, Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth, to . HBO later this year. Moving on: Tyson is pictured with his third wife, Lakiha Spicer, in Los Angeles in 2009 . Tyson's wife, Kiki, wrote the script for the stage show, which toured the country earlier this year. Tyson said it reflects his life's journey from Brooklyn street tough guy to happily married father, and credits his wife for his foray into promoting. 'I'm incredibly grateful to HBO for partnering with me and for believing in my story,' Tyson said. 'It is an honor and a privilege to be working with them to bring my one-man show, 'Undisputed Truth,' to live on the television screen.'","Former boxing champ made shock revelations at press conference Friday .

"By . Jenny Hope . UPDATED: . 07:17 EST, 4 November 2011 . It is cheaper and more effective for GPs to send overweight patients to diet programmes such as Weight Watchers than treat them on the NHS, according to new research. Offering patients one-to-one counselling in diet and fitness via GP surgeries or pharmacies is 'ineffective', as are programmes run by NHS food advisers and dieticians. Experts from Birmingham University said the money would be better spent paying for patients to attend classes run by commercial companies. Big benefits: Losing just 7lb could gain you an extra year of life, according to research at Birmingham University . They said the benefits include cutting the risk of diabetes and boosting life expectancy. They found people who lose just 7lbs could gain an extra year of life, but the weight loss would have to be sustained forever. The study of 740 British slimmers found that those who went to a commercial slimming group for three months lost up to three times as much weight as those who were given diet advice by their family doctor. Researchers speculated that this could be because group sessions provided a greater morale-boost and that the diet leaders had often gone through losing weight themselves. Study leader Dr Kate Jolly said commercial sessions, paid for by the NHS, were also significantly cheaper, . with a course of 12 one-hour group sessions costing around £55 – just . slightly more than one 12-minute GP appointment. The average weight loss was best for those attending Weight Watchers sessions – they lost almost 10lbs  (4.4kg) on average in a year – and worst for those following advice from a pharmacy, who lost only 2.6lbs (1.2kg). Dr . Jolly said the NHS-funded study analysed the effect on life expectancy . of weight loss of around 7lbs  (3.5kg) in a 14-stone 49-year-old – . the average age of people taking part in the study. She added: ‘It shows that losing a fairly modest amount of weight is worthwhile, although the big challenge is maintaining the weight loss. Many studies show that people tend to put it on again after a short period of time.’ Group support: Kelly Meager was Slimming World's slimmer of the year in 2010. She shed 10st 9lbs . In . the study, published in the British Medical Journal, the obese and . overweight participants were asked by their GPs to join several . commercial weight loss programmes, or have counselling from GPs or . pharmacists over 12 weeks. Another . group was given free vouchers for a local fitness centre. After one . year, all those attending commercial sessions had lost significant . amounts of weight, while counselling made little difference. Almost a third of people allocated to the Weight Watchers group achieved a five per cent drop in body weight – the level needed to cut the risk of developing diabetes. Attendance seemed to be the key factor, with people going more often to commercial sessions. Dr Jolly said: ‘GPs don’t have the tools for helping patients lose weight consistently, but they were the reason these patients were nudged towards losing weight in the first place.’ Almost a quarter of adults in England are now classified as obese and around two-thirds of Primary Care Trusts in England and Wales already pay for patients to attend Weight Watchers courses.",Study says NHS should pay for patients to join commercial diet groups .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:19 EST, 1 November 2011 . A young Asian bride was drugged and held prisoner by her family after she broke off an arranged engagement to her first cousin and secretly married another man, a court heard today. Naila Afsar, 23, was also threatened with death, assaulted and abused by angry close relatives after they discovered she had wed Afsar Saddiq without telling them, it was alleged. She was given a milky drink laced with a prescription-only sedative in a bid to put her to sleep while they took her back to the family home - and away from her new husband, it was said. Shamim Akhtar, Naila's mother (left), and sister, Saima Mahmood (right), are accused of drugging the Asian bride after she broke off an arranged marriage . Mr Saddiq, meanwhile, was visited by Naila Afsar's family, who told him his new wife would not be returning before stealing his mobile phone to stop the couple keeping in contact, a jury heard. Naila Afsar's mother Shamim Akhtar, 58, father Mohammed Khan, 57, her elder brother Shamrez Khan, 34, all from Bradford, West Yorkshire, and her sister Saima Mahmood, 30, and her brother-in-law Zahid Mahmood, 36, both of Accrington, face a string of charges. They all deny false imprisonment, kidnap and two charges of administering the drug lorazepam with intent, in January last year, after claiming in a police interview they were trying to help Naila 'resolve a domestic situation'. Mr Jonathan Dickinson, prosecuting, told Burnley Crown Court Naila Afsar's family wanted her to marry her first cousin, who lived in Denmark. Naila became engaged to him in May 2009, but she realised they were not suited to one another and in July 2009, called it off. 'Her family was upset with her and that was, perhaps, putting it mildly,' said Mr Dickinson. 'The complainant ran away from the family home and went to live with a friend in Newcastle, thinking the defendants could not reach her.' Naila's father, Mohammed Khan, 57, left, and brother Shamrez Khan, 34, are also accused of drugging and kidnapping her after she secretly married another man . Mr Dickinson said that while in Newcastle, she met Mr Saddiq, they got on well and were wed in November 2009 at a local mosque, without her family knowing. 'The family found out soon after and towards the end of November, Naila Afsar visited the family home in Bradford with her new husband to introduce him to her family, in the hope of resolving their differences,' added the prosecutor. 'It wasn't an overwhelming success, but Naila Afsar said she would return to Bradford at the end of November, for Eid. 'She did so and was put under a lot of pressure from her family, who were not happy about her having broken off the engagement and married a man they did not know or approve of. The prosecutor said when the alleged victim went to Bradford for Eid, she was threatened and abused by her relatives, who wanted her to separate from Mr Saddiq or divorce him and start a relationship on a different footing, in accordance with their wishes. Mr Jonathan Dickinson, prosecutor . Naila Afsar disagreed and went to live in Newcastle with her husband, determined to have no more contact with her family. On the morning of Sunday, January 17, last year, the newlyweds were in bed at their home, when they heard banging on the doors and the door bell being rung continually, the court heard. They heard Shamrez Khan shouting in an aggressive way and he then appeared in their bedroom. The other defendants, apart from her father, were in the living room and at first they were pleasant, acting as if it was a perfectly normal thing for a family to do. Saima Mahmood tried to pressure her to go back to Accrington, promising no harm would come to her and telling her if she wanted to return to Newcastle she would be allowed to go back straight away. Naila agreed to go to Accrington with them and to stay just one night at their home. Accused: Naila's family all denied kidnap and administering drugs with intent at Burnley Crown Court . At the Accrington property, there was only Mrs Afsar, the Mahmoods and their young children present, everyone got on well, she felt comfortable and said she would stay another night and go home on the Tuesday. The prosecutor continued: 'It seems that that evidence reveals that her sister Saima Mahmood used the closeness of their relationship, really to trick her into coming back to Accrington and then staying, so that the family could exert more pressure on her with relation to her marriage and her relationship with Mr Saddiq.' Unbeknown to the alleged victim, her mother, her brother and brother-in-law had travelled back up to Newcastle in the middle of the night, confronted Mr Saddiq and collected Naila Afsar's belongings, including her passport. When Naila Afsar awoke on the Tuesday morning, she found she could not get hold of her husband, despite the fact they had been in regular contact. Mr Dickinson said it transpired Shamrez Khan had threatened Mr Saddiq, tried to punch him and told him his wife would be staying in Bradford and wouldn't be going back. Mr Saddiq's mobile phone was also taken from him. Akhtar and Shamrez Khan then turned up in Accrington with the alleged victim's belongings and told her they had been up to Newcastle, spoken to Mr Saddiq and 'effectively sorted him out'. Shamrez Khan took his sister's mobile phone, hit her twice across the face and threatened to kill her, the court heard. Naila Afsar wasn't prepared to tolerate the way she was being treated and said she wanted to go back to Newcastle. Saima Mahmood once again tried to win her sister's trust and told her she was prepared to take her back to Newcastle that same day. She then persuaded her sister to have some warm milk and immediately after drinking it, Mrs Afsar felt dizzy, was repeatedly sick, everything became blurred and she couldn't keep her eyes open. The prosecutor said the alleged victim lost track of time and had very little recollection of the next few hours. She remembered her father Mohammed Khan arriving in Accrington and felt herself being led to a car, but the next thing she recalled after that was the police knocking on the window of the vehicle. By that stage, 9.05pm, she was at a petrol station in Baxenden, Lancashire, in Zahid Mahmood's car. He was driving and she and her father were in the back. Mr Dickinson said: ' According to the police, she appeared intoxicated, extremely drowsy and they thought she needed to be taken to hospital. 'Blood and urine samples were taken from her, analysed and the drug lorazepam was found, consistent with her having been given a dose of this drug some time in the hours leading up to those samples being taken.' The court heard the defendants were arrested on January 20, were interviewed and all claimed they had only been trying to help Naila Afsar out in resolving a domestic situation. The trial continues.

Archaeologists in Turkey believe they have found a small piece of the cross used to crucify Jesus. It was discovered in a stone chest on the site of seventh-century Balatlar Church in Sinop and tests are now being carried out to try to determine its authenticity. Legend has it that the cross was discovered in 325 AD and parts were sent to religious leaders around the world and this may explain how the piece ended up in Turkey. Professor Gülgün Koroglu, pictured, believe she has found a small piece of the cross used to crucify Jesus. It was discovered in a stone chest carved with crosses, pictured, on the site of the Balatlar Church in Sinop, Turkey. The relic hasn't been photographed yet because it is being tested . Professor Gülgün Koroglu who headed up the excavation told the Hurriyet Daily News: 'We have found a holy thing in a chest. It is a piece of a cross, and we think it was [part of the cross on which Jesus was crucified]. This stone chest is very important to us. It has a history and is the most important artifact we have unearthed so far.' Professor Koroglu believes the relics inside the chest are holy because crosses were carved into the sides. According to religious legend, Helene Augustus, the mother of Constantine travelled to Jerusalem in around 325 AD to learn more about the crucifixion and try to find the True Cross. The cross was said to have been divided - part of it is believed to have remained in Jerusalem while other parts were sent to religious leaders in Rome and Constantinople, the modern-day Istanbul in Turkey. Koroglu and her team began working on the site at the Balatlar Church, built in 660 AD, site in 2009. The excavation has already uncovered more than 1,000 skeletons, like the one pictured, and all the relics found have been sent for testing to confirm their identity and authenticity . A number of relics purported to be parts of the True Cross, or nails used during the crucifixion have been found by churches, including a 2,000-year-old chest discovered in 1981. French archaeologist Charles Rohault de Fleury supposedly . said in the 19th-century that if all of these catalogued relics were put together they would still only make up less than a third of the cross, which is thought to have been around 12ft high. This suggests that there may still be parts of the cross that are yet to be uncovered. Koroglu and her team began working on the site at the . Balatlar Church, built in 660 AD, site in 2009.

Washington has been scrambling to tamp down a controversy over suspended death benefits for the families of fallen military soldiers, and the White House has announced that a charity would pick up the costs of the payments during the government shutdown. `The Fisher House Foundation will provide the families of the fallen with the benefits they so richly deserve,` Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a statement, adding that the Pentagon would reimburse the foundation after the shutdown ended. Hagel said Fisher House, which works with veterans and their families, had approached the Pentagon about making the payments. The Defense Department typically pays families about $100,000 within three days of a soldier's death, but officials say the shutdown was preventing those benefits from being paid. A senior defense official said the government could not actively solicit funds from private organizations, but could accept an offer. Scroll down for video . Sad sight: Pfc. Cody Patterson's body was brought back to the United States after being killed in Afghanistan on October 6. His funeral expenses are now being paid by a charity because of the shutdown . Respect: The Pentagon has now agreed to pay the charity back after the shutdown is lifted and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was at Dover Air Force Base when Patterson's body arrived . The failure to make the payments has stirred outrage both on Capitol Hill and at the White House. Obama spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that the president was `disturbed` when he found out the death benefits had been suspended and demanded an immediate solution. `The commander in chief, when he found out that this was not addressed, he directed that a solution be found, and we expect one today,` Carney said before the Pentagon announced the agreement with Fisher House. The House unanimously passed legislation Wednesday to restore the death benefits but it's unclear whether the Democratic-led Senate will take up the measure or whether Obama would sign it. Obama has threatened to veto other legislation passed by the House in recent days that would reopen individual funding steams, arguing that a piecemeal approach was unacceptable and the entire government must be reopened. The fix has not satisfied all of the . soldiers relatives, and one father cannot believe that members of . Congress are still getting paid during the shutdown. 'If . Congress were trapped in a car that sunk down in a river, I would swim . to the window, and I would look them all in the eye and say, ""Suck . water,""' said Randall Peterson, the father of 24-year-old PFC Cody . Peterson who was killed in the field. The names of the five soldiers who were killed have been released-Sgt Patrick Hawkins, Special Agent Joseph Peters, Patterson, Marine LCPL Jeremiah Collins Jr, Lt Jennifer Moreno- and Fox News reports that they are all under the age of 25 years old. Victims twice over: The relatives of Sgt Patrick Hawkins (left) and 1st Lt Jennifer Moreno (right) are now being denied survivors benefits from the military because of the federal shutdown . Anger: PFC Cody Patterson's (left)  father is outraged at Congress, and Marine LCPL Jeremiah Collins (right) was the youngest of the fallen at only 19-years-old . Father: Special Agent Joseph Peters, 24, leaves behind a wife and 20-month-old son . 'After losing a loved one in service . to our nation, these families should not have to endure more pain as the . result of political squabbling,' said Ken Fisher, the head of the . military-focused charity that stepped up. Mr Patterson was not the only grieving family member to speak out, and a number of others have come forward. ‘The . government is hurting the wrong people,’ Shannon Collins, who lost her . son, Marine Lance Corporal Jeremiah M. Collins Jr., over the weekend in . Afghanistan told NBC News. ‘Families shouldn’t have to worry about how they’re going to bury their child,’ she added. ‘Families shouldn’t have to worry about how they're going to feed their family if they don’t go to work this week.’ Sgt Hawkins was on his fourth deployment to Afghanistan, he died rushing to the aid of another dying soldier. ‘Sgt. Patrick Hawkins was a brave and incredibly talented Ranger,’ Lt. Col., . Patrick J. Ellis, the commander of the 3rd battalion, told NBC News. ‘His actions that night were in keeping with the epitome of the Ranger . Creed: ‘I will never leave a fallen comrade.’ First Lt. Moreno was a nurse assigned to the cultural support team, it was her first combat deployment. ‘Our unit mourns the loss of 1st Lt. Jennifer Moreno,’ Lt Col. Ellis told NBC News. Lance Cpl Collins was out of high school for just over a year when he died in what NBC News termed ‘murky circumstances.’ Denied . what they rightfully deserve, the families of these heroes should soon . receive their benefits, according to Speaker Boehner. ‘Tomorrow, . the House is going to act specifically on this and I hope the president . will sign it,’ he said during a Tuesday press conference. Determined: Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner has tried to submit a bill approving the payment of 'death benefits' to military families but Democrats don't want to take a piecemeal approach to the budget approval process . The . payment of the so-called 'death benefits' has become a political issue . on its own as Republican Speaker John Boehner has blasted Democrats for . failing to support his bill to fund the payouts before the budget is . approved fully. 'I think it's disgraceful that they're withholding these benefits,' he said. The . seemingly obvious move to pay the benefits is steeped in political . motivations, however, as Boehner and the Republicans have repeatedly . tried to push through smaller single-issue funding appropriations . without agreeing to end the shutdown by approving an entire budget. President . Obama was reportedly 'disturbed' to find out that it would take longer . than the standard three days to get the 'benefits' to the relatives and . press secretary Jay Carney said that a solution would be found . Wednesday. 'It is . upsetting because my husband died for his country, and now his family is . left to worry,' Ashley Peters, the wife of Joseph Peters, told NBC. 'My husband always said if something happened to him we would be taken care of. 'I'm a stay-at-home mom, which is what my husband wanted. He wanted me to take care of our son.' The five soldiers whose funeral payments are being fought over are far from the only ones who face financial letdown. Continued rhetoric: President Obama gave a press conference on Tuesday saying that he would not negotiate under threat but Republicans want certain services funded before approving the entire budget . About . 3.8 million veterans will not receive disability compensation next . month if the partial government shutdown continues into late October, . Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki says. Some 315,000 veterans and 202,000 surviving spouses and dependents will see pension payments stopped. Shinseki . is spelling out some of the dire consequences of a longer-term shutdown . in testimony Wednesday for the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. The . short-term consequences have meant that disability claims production . has slowed by an average of about 1,400 per day since the shutdown began . October 1, and that has stalled the department's efforts to reduce the . backlog of disability claims pending for longer than 125 days. In all, more than $6 billion in payments would be halted with an extended shutdown. 'In some areas, like health care delivery, there are fewer adverse effects. In others, such as reducing the claims backlog, we have already seen a negative impact,' Shinseki says in written testimony obtained by The Associated Press in advance of the hearing. The House has passed legislation that would provide veterans disability, pension and other benefits in the event of a prolonged shutdown, but the White House has pushed against the piecemeal approach. Shinseki plans to make that case as well, saying it's not the best solution for veterans. He'll note that even if the VA were fully funded, some services to veterans would suffer.","Relatives of fallen soldiers are typically paid $100,000 to cover funeral expenses and travel arrangements .

Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai told her friend not to worry because the Taliban 'have never come for a small girl', shortly before she was shot in the head by a militant. The 16-year-old was gunned down last year on her school bus after angering the Taliban with her brave and outspoken pleas for girls to be educated. In her autobiography, I am Malala, she describes the moment she was shot on her way home from school in the valley of Swat in north-west Pakistan on October 9, 2012. Scroll down for video . Malala Yousafzai revealed in her autobiography that she told her friend not to worry because the Taliban 'have never come after a small girl' shortly before she was shot in the head by a militant . Malala was travelling with about 20 other girls when a masked man approached their school bus and said: 'Who is Malala?' Although no one said a word, some girls looked at Malala and she as the only one with her face uncovered. In excerpts from her autobiography, published in Parade magazine, she wrote: 'That's when he lifted up a black pistol. The schoolgirl wrote about the moment she was shot in her autobiography, I Am Malala . 'Some of the girls screamed. [Best friend] Moniba tells me I squeezed her hand. 'My friends say he fired three shots. The first went through my left eye socket and out under my left shoulder. 'I slumped forward onto Moniba, blood coming from my left ear, so the other two bullets hit the girls next to me... My friends later told me the gunman's hand was shaking as he fired.' The bullet miraculously missed her brain. She travelled to Britain for treatment but her injuries were so bad that her father asked relatives to start arranging her funeral. After spending three months recovering in hospital, she and her family now live in Birmingham. She attracted the wrath of the Taliban after writing a blog for the BBC when she was 11 and also appeared in a New York Times documentary. Malala has since become an education and peace advocate and recently wowed dignitaries at the United Nations in New York with a speech on education on her sixteenth birthday. She has also been invited to Buckingham Palace and it is thought the Queen is impressed by Malala's bravery. In hospital: Malala was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after the bullet went through her left eye . Support: She and her family, including father Ziauddin and her two younger brothers now live in Birmingham . A Palace spokesman said: 'We . understand that Malala Yousafzai will be attending the Commonwealth . Universities and Education Reception at Buckingham Palace.' A doctor who helped save Malala after she transferred to Birmingham for treatment has spoken of the pressure she felt to save her. Fiona Reynolds, an intensive care specialist at Birmingham Children's Hospital, told the Sunday Times: 'I'd become a doctor because I was lucky to get a good education. 'I felt if she'd died I would have killed Pakistan's Mother Teresa. 'Not often in my pampered life am I asked to put my neck out.' She said there is now a child alive 'who could make a lot of difference to the world'. She . has been invited to a reception for Youth, Education and the . Commonwealth, being hosted by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on . October 18. Guests are . expected to include academics and teachers. It is being arranged as a . celebration of young people across the Commonwealth in education. In New York, Malala called on governments to act in the fight for education and to eradicate poverty and terrorism. She said girls are being pushed into 'the Stone Age'. She said: 'Women are not even accepted as human beings. They are treated with injustice and inequality. Women are denied. 'They are neglected, even in the developed countries where they are not given the opportunities to do what they want. Even in America, people are waiting for a woman president. 'I know that issues are countless and enormous but the solution is one and simple and that is education, education, education. 'We can fight all these hardships and lead to quality education for both boys and girls.' She told dignitaries, including Hilary Clinton, that to end wars in Syria, Pakistan and Afghanistan 'instead of sending guns, send books. Instead of sending tanks, send pens. Instead of sending soldiers, send teachers.' She has set up the Malala Fund, which promotes education for girls and women across the world.","Malala Yousafzai described moment she was shot in autobiography .

The dancer who was on the bridge when the Costa Concordia cruise ship hit a reef killing 32 people, has admitted at the captain's manslaughter trial that they were lovers. Domnica Cemortan also told the Italian court that she boarded as a non-paying passenger hours before the crash near the island of Giglio, saying: 'When you are someone's lover no one asks you for a ticket.' She dismissed the remark as a joke to her translator. Someone's lover: Domnica Cemortan, from Moldavia, addresses the media as she leaves the converted Teatro Moderno theatre this afternoon . Captain's lover: Left, Moldovan Domnica Cemortan, 25, pictured with a friend and right, as she left court today after telling the trial that they had indeed been lovers at the time of the shipwreck which left 32 people dead . Schettino was allegedly seen 'drinking' at dinner in the . company of Miss Cemortan the evening of the collision. The picture of . her on the right was taken on the bridge of the Concordia . Moldovan Miss Cemortan said she had worked on the Concordia for three weeks in December 2011. The Moldovan dancer admitted she was Captain Francesco Schettino's lover and boarded the Costa Concordia without a ticket . She tried to dodge the question of whether she was romantically involved with captain Francesco Schettino, and only responded positively after being told she risked criminal charges for refusing to reply. Earlier the trial heard that the ship hit the reef after Schettino was disappointed at not getting close enough to it on an earlier attempt, his trial has been told. Crew member Maitre d'Antonello Tievoli, who comes from the island of Giglio, said he asked the captain to make a close pass as a favour to his family who lived there. Mr Tievoli said Schettino obliged on January 6 last year, but decided the Concordia had not been close enough and ordered his No. 2 officer to plot a closer route next time. Exactly a week later, the Concordia smashed into the reef off Giglio and capsized. Schettino has blamed the helmsman for the botched manoeuvre. The sinking of the Costa Concordia in January last year is one of the worst maritime disasters in living memory. The frantic moments before the cruise liner hit rocks were revealed in court yesterday. Schettino is said to have cried out 'Madonna, what have I done?', as the cruise liner hurtled into rocks off the coast of Tuscany.

Schettino, 52, is facing 20 years jail time if convicted of dereliction of duty and multiple counts of manslaughter. His lawyers argue that he is not solely responsible for the tragedy.

Sandy may have seemed uniquely damaging to those caught in its path, but some . have suggested that global warming could bring even more devastating storms to . the U.S. in coming years. New York governor Andrew Cuomo and mayor Michael Bloomberg both pointed to . climate change as the culprit for Sandy's ravages as they addressed the scale . of the destruction on Tuesday morning. And Cuomo even raised the possibility of a levee being built in New York . Harbor, an unprecedented move to protect the 400-year-old city. Both Andrew Cuomo (left) and Michael Bloomberg agree that climate change is a cause of the superstorm . Many observers have pointed out that it is almost impossible to pinpoint . climate change as the cause of specific weather events. Moreover, the U.S. has long been subject to hurricanes and other damaging . storms which have been just as violent as Sandy. But the terrors wrought by Sandy, combined with last year's destructive . Hurricane Irene, have led New York's top officials to raise the spectre of . global warming. At a press conference in Manhattan on Tuesday, Cuomo said he had told President . Obama that 'we have a 100-year flood every two years now'. He added: 'There has been a series of extreme weather incidents. That is not a . political statement. That is a factual statement. 'Anyone who says there's not a dramatic change in weather patterns, I think is . denying reality.' Bloomberg echoed the sentiment, saying: 'What is clear is that the storms we've . experienced in the last year or so around this country and around the world are . much more severe than before. 'Whether that's global warming or what, I don't know, but we'll have to address . those issues.' When the governor was asked if officials were contemplating building a levee in . the city's harbour, he replied: 'It is something we're going to have to start . thinking about. 'The construction of this city did not anticipate these kinds of situations. We . are only a few feet above sea level.' Since New York City's foundation in the early 17th century, the lower tip of . Manhattan has been at the heart of metropolitan life - despite its . vulnerability to flooding from the harbour. Al Gore predictably joined the climate-change chorus on Tuesday, describing the . hurricane as 'a disturbing sign of things to come' in a post on his blog. 'We must heed this warning and act quickly to solve the climate crisis,' the . former Vice President added. Two possible links between global warming and the damage wrought by Sandy are . the raised sea levels which make it easier for the coast to flood, and warm air . in the Atlantic Ocean increasing the fierceness of the storm. However, many experts have denied that climate change was behind Hurricane . Sandy - Houston Chronicle science reporter Eric Bergen wrote that the . connection was 'a stretch that is just not supported by science at this time.' The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has previously said that there is . little evidence global warming worsens tropical storms and hurricanes.","Governor Cuomo makes unprecedented suggestion of a possible levee being built for the city .

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 12:08 EST, 2 December 2011 . A teenage student stabbed to death and dumped in a canal was groomed for sexual exploitation by adults from the age of 12, it has been revealed. Laura Wilson, 17, had been tracked by social services since 2005 after she was identified as being 'at risk' of sexual exploitation by British Pakistani men. But their work focused on other girls who were more closely associated with abusers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Laura Wilson had a brief fling with near . neighbour Ishaq Hussain, 22, and gave birth to their daughter in June . last year . The white teenager was the victim of a cycle of sexual abuse and little was done to help her, Laura's family have claimed. Rather than removing her from the situation, social services only carried out 'preventative' work to stop her falling into the clutches of abusers. The student was murdered in October last year after bringing 'shame' on two Asian families. She had a brief fling with married Ishaq Hussain, now 22, and became pregnant with his child while she was in a sexual relationship with Ashitaq Asghar. Ashitaq Asghar (pictured) admitted killing Laura . Wilson in May this year and will be sentenced later . A few days before she was murdered and dumped in the canal she had revealed to the two families that she had had affairs with both men. After being informed of the relationship, Asghar's mother apparently hit Laura with a shoe. she said her son would never have a baby with a white girl and called Laura a 'dirty white b****', and she should 'keep her legs closed'. The teenager had become pregnant just a month after she turned 16 and gave birth to Hussain's child in June last year. Asghar pleaded guilty to murder in May, while yesterday a Sheffield Crown Court jury cleared . 22-year-old Mr Hussain of Laura's murder after deliberating for nearly 11 . hours. Prosecutor Nicholas Campbell QC told the trial that Mr Hussain and Asghar mounted a 'mission to kill' Laura. They adopted the language of the cult . British film 'Four Lions', a dark comedy about Islamic terrorists . plotting an attack which was filmed in Sheffield and which they had both . seen. Asghar sent a series of texts to Mr Hussain using language from the film. Asghar talked about buying a . 'shooter' for £400 and he boasted about bringing his 'hit list' out. In . fact, said Mr Campbell, the murder weapon of choice turned out to be a . knife. In one message, Asghar said to . Hussain the day before she died which read: 'I'm gonna send that kaffir . (non-Muslim) b**** straight to hell'. Mr Campbell QC described Laura as 'embracing life with gusto and she was an attractive and popular girl'. Hussain told the jury he did not plot anything with Asghar and there was no plan to kill Laura. Simon Csoka, representing Mr Hussain, said his client 'was an unfaithful philanderer whose attitude to women absolutely stinks...but although he's guilty of many things, he's not guilty of murder'. The Rotherham Safeguarding Children Board have carried out an investigation into Laura's death and the findings will be published in around a month. The teenager's body was found in this canal in Rotherham, Yorkshire. The tent pictured was put up by scenes of crime officers . Chairman Alan Hazell said more could have been done to help the teenager. 'Whilst not wishing to pre-empt that . report, it is clear that Laura’s situation was very complex, which made . it difficult for agencies to engage with her. 'However, there were times when agencies may have worked differently or more effectively. 'All agencies which had links with . Laura have taken part in the review and have already shown a strong . commitment to learn any lessons the case has highlighted. 'This commitment has already been . reflected in the work done to improve services for children and young . people in the borough following challenge from the Government.' He added that the case had been both 'complex and tragic'. 'This was a despicable crime in which a vulnerable young woman was viciously attacked and left for dead,' he added. 'It has left a young child without a mother and we hope that the earlier conviction which has been secured will help her family and friends as they continue to come to terms with what happened.' Laura's links with  Risky Business - the town's child exploitation project - Risky Business, and the fact that the relevant authorities knew she was having under-age sex with Pakistani men did not come up in the murder trial and has never been publicly acknowledged, the Time reported. Earlier this year an investigation by the same newspaper triggered an assessment of street grooming. The Times uncovered a pattern of child-sex offending involving Pakistani men and girls aged 12 to 16.","Laura Wilson, 17, identified as 'at risk' of sexual exploitation in 2005 .

"By . Daily Mail Repoter . PUBLISHED: . 16:19 EST, 29 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:19 EST, 29 October 2013 . The man suspected of killing the 2-year-old biological son of NFL star Adrian Peterson has been released from jail on a bond. Officials have revealed that Joseph Robert Patterson is no longer being held at the Minnehaha County Jail in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Patterson, 27, was the live-in boyfriend of Ann 'Ashley' Doohen who had a son with NFL star Adrian Peterson. Ms Doohen did not tell Peterson that he was the biological father of her son Tyrese until recently. Accused: Joey Patterson, 27, was the only other person in his girlfriend's apartment at the time that he called police to report that her son Tyrese was 'choking'. The boy died from head injuries two days later . Patterson was the only one at her apartment with Tyrese when he was brutally beaten, and he was later charged with aggravated assault and aggravated battery. Those charges were increased to include second-degree murder and manslaughter following Tyrese's death at a hospital two days later. Patterson's attorney confirmed that he has been released- in spite of his prior domestic violence convictions- and said that there are no conditions or restrictions attached to his bail bond. Tim Rensch, the attorney, said that his client will remain in the area in order to defend himself against the charges. Patterson's father has spoken out about his son's well being and his condition when he was in jail, saying that he was growing frustrated with the accusations against him. History of violence: Patterson has been charged with domestic violence issues in the past and faced restraining orders and his current charges of assault and battery could be increased to murder since the boy died . Tragic: Adrian Peterson (right) only learned that he was the biological father of Tyrese (left) two months before the boy's death, and the NFL star had never met the boy until he saw him in the hospital . 'He’s moving into a pissed-off stage now. He’s getting bitter,' Grant Patterson told The New York Daily News. 'There’s a double tragedy in this case. My son’s heart bleeds for the child. I pray there is no rush to judgment. 'There are death threats against my son.' Outrageous: Patterson (left), who lived with Tyrese's mother Ann 'Ashley' Doohen (right), is said to be 'getting bitter' behind bars . His son was living with the boy's mother, Ann 'Ashley' Doohen, and he had a history of violence. Patterson, 27, had a restraining order filed against him over his high school girlfriend in 2004. Noell Uhlir filed a petition in order to get protection for her daughter Carlie Rae who was dating Joey at the time. 'I believe that Joey is mentally unstable, and it is only a matter of time before he harms himself, my daughter or anyone that may step in,' she wrote. 'Joey needs professional help.' The second legal incident came in June 2012 when he was indicted for multiple counts of simple assault. 'Difficult day': NFL star Adrian Peterson talks to reporters the day after the funeral service of his son Ty . Tragic: Friends and relatives are posting pictures of Tyrese 'Ty' Doheen who died on Friday . The victim in that situation was his then-girlfriend who has not been named and the 3-year-old son that the couple had together. The girlfriend said that Patterson slapped their son on his bare butt causing him to need ice to calm the welts, and later Patterson attempted to strangle her and threatened her life. Following incident, he violated the no-contact order that came in that case, and was due to spend a year in jail over the charges but that was ruled out by his agreement to attend domestic violence conseling. The death of Tyrese last week was brought into the national spotlight as it was revealed that Minnesota Vikings player Adrian Peterson was actually the boy's biological father. Peterson said he didn't know the child was his until about two months ago and had been working with the boy's mother to support the family financially. Little guy: Ty, seen here watching football, lived with his mother and her boyfriend who has since been arrested and charged with aggravated battery though he may now face murder charges since the boy died . 'It was a difficult day, just taking in the circumstance and the whole situation,' Peterson said of Wednesday's funeral in Sioux Falls. 'A child was buried. That's difficult for anyone. 'I was planning on seeing him and I had talked with his mom and had gotten some things together as far as financially helping her. Unfortunately, this situation took place and it's devastating. 'A lot of people won't ever understand the situation that I'm in and see it the way I'm seeing the situation,' he said. 'It's tough, but I'm able to deal with that. I got a good supporting cast around me. I'm standing strong, I am.'","NFL star Adrian Peterson only learned he had another biological son named Tyrese two months ago .

Tuesday morning at Nashville International Airport and burst into . flames, killing the pilot. It went unnoticed until being seen just . before 9am by the pilot of a large commercial jet taxiing by the . wreckage. It was not discovered until 9am - well after sunrise, when a plane attempting to take off spotted the wreckage and reported it. Socked in: The pilot attempted to land late at night in heavy fog and apparently crashed about 3am Tuesday . The wreckage of the plane can be seen here from the air. It appears that the aircraft burst into flames after crash-landing . Officials have remained tight-lipped . about the accident. The pilot has not been identified, but the plane was . registered to the Windsor Flying Club, in Ontario, Canada, according to . reports. The crash did not delay commercial flights into or out of the airport - jets used the other three runways. The National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating how the crash went unnoticed for several hours, WTVF-TV reports. Footage from the scene showed the burnt out hull of a plane sitting just to the right of one of the airport’s main runways. Radio transmissions aired on WSMV, . detailed the confusion on the ground shortly after the charred aircraft . was first noticed. The tower had no idea what had happened. ‘Just . to verify, there is debris on the field just before you get to [runway] . two center?’ The tower asked. ‘Is it off the runway?’ ‘Roger,’ confirmed the pilot. A small private airplane: This Cessna-172 single-engine plane flew from Ontario to Nashville and tried to land in heavy fog . Dead: The pilot, still unidentified, was killed in the crash . ‘He says it’s about 500 feet from the . approach… it appears that something may have gone off the right side of . the runway,’ the tower continued. Airport operations then scrambled to mount a response, temporarily closing the airport. In . an even more bizarre twist, an air traffic controller told someone sent . to investigate the scene not to radio the findings back to the tower, . but to call on a private phone line. A call placed to Nashville Airport by MailOnline seeking further comment was not returned. The . unidentified pilot, in his late 30s and licensed to fly since 1989, . according to Windsor Flight Club president Richard Gillies, did not . survive the crash. ‘He was a . member in good standing, his license was in good standing and he was . qualified to fly at night,’ Mr Gillies told MailOnline. Sprawling: Nashville International Airport as seen from above . The pilot had flown WFC planes before, had checked-in, rented the plane and done everything the right way, said Mr Gillies. ‘There’s nothing surrounding this occurrence that is out of the ordinary,’ he added. Outside of the crash, which the seasoned pilot said has never happened in the organization’s 77-year history. ‘We’ve been training pilots and renting aircraft since 1944 and we’ve never had an accident of this magnitude,’ said Mr Gillies. It . is not known if the deceased pilot was married or had any family, his . name is being withheld until next of kin, if they exist, can be . notified, Mr Gillies added. The National Transportation Safety Board has yet to comment on the accident, but it is believed weather may have played a part. The investigation is ongoing.

Explanation: They left behind a letter explaining why they had run away and apologizing to their families . Messer, a recently divorced father-of-one . who has known Lalinsky since she was a little girl, had written in a note: 'We . are in love and cannot be apart from each other. 'This is sad to us but our love, though . we've had to keep it a secret, has been the best part of both our lives. Please be happy for us.' Lalinksy . added to her mom, Lisa Schwartz: 'You are an amazing and wonderful mother and person. I'm so . sorry I hurt you and if there was any other way we would've done it. 'Try not to be sad and don't blame yourself, nothing could be done.' Schwartz earlier wiped away the tears as she . said how she felt betrayed by a man who was 'like a brother to me'. She . added that the pair, who had met at church, had never showed any signs . they had feelings for each other. She said that Messer, who is from .

Quiet: Emily, whom her mother described as an introvert, has known Messer since she was a child . 'Emily doesn't have a dad, so she always looked up . to Bob as a dad, as a father figure. They're both very introverted. They both love photography and they both love hiking.' Schwartz, who has six children and is . recently married, said she had always appreciated the time Messer had spent with . her daughter because she had been so busy with the family. 'With . me having so many kids I could not just take her and do things with . her, so he was like, ""I'll take her to Ann Arbor, I'll take her to . Botanical Gardens"",' she recounted. Lisa . and her husband Neil reported her daughter missing on Sunday night and . police had been treating it as a missing person case. 'We can work through this, we always do,' her mother pleaded.

Kidnapping survivor Elizabeth Smart and her husband have revealed that they want to start a family. Smart's husband Matthew Gilmour spoke out for the first time ever as part of the hour-long special about his wife's kidnapping 11 years ago. The Scotsman married Elizabeth in August of last year, and he opened up to Meredith Vieira during an NBC interview about how he had no idea about the nine-month ordeal that defined so much of his wife's childhood. New beginnings: Smart married fellow Mormon Matthew Gilmour and he had never heard of her case until she told him all of the details herself . Strong: Gilmour said that when he learned of Elizabeth's past, he was surprised because he would have expected someone who went through that kind of terror to be depressed . The two met as they are both Mormons and he was in America as part of a trip with his church. He said that he had never heard of her when they were first introduced, and she was the one to tell him about what had happened to her. 'I was surprised because like when I think of someone who's been through something like that, I would think they would be depressed so I was very surprised of how well she's overcome it,' she said. The first addition to their family unit was their dog Archie who they were seen walking during the interview, and who Elizabeth took with her as she showed Vieira the remote campsite where her captors kept her for months. Happy now: Smart had her husband Matthew Gilmour alongside her for portions of the interview with Vieira . The next step: Smart and Gilmour told Meredith Vieira that they want to start a family . Smart has showed great poise in the years following her 2003 rescue, especially lately as she has begun speaking to victims support groups and sharing the details of how she was raped on a daily basis by her captor in order to help raise awareness about sexual assault. Elizabeth and Matthew also revealed to Meredith that they are thinking about starting a family, although for now she has been busy writing her book and giving inspirational speeches. Smart, who is now 25, arranged the interview with Vieira in conjunction to the launch of her memoir, My Story. She and Gilmour married in a traditional Mormon ceremony in Hawaii but he was sure to bring some of his Scottish ancestry to the proceedings by wearing a kilt. The couple met while on their missionary year in France, were accompanied by about 12 family members and very close friends.

Syria has seen its first confirmed polio outbreak in 14 years, raising fears it will spread across the country. The U.N.'s health agency confirmed ten polio cases in northeast Syria. Officials are awaiting lab results on another 12 cases showing polio symptoms, said World Health Organization spokesman Oliver Rosenbauer. Mr Rosenbauer said the confirmed cases are among babies and toddlers, all under two, who were 'under-immunized' Pictured are children that made swings from rockets in Damascus . Mr Rosenbauer said the confirmed cases are among babies and toddlers, all under two, who were 'under-immunized. The polio virus, a highly contagious disease, usually infects children in unsanitary conditions through the consumption of food or liquid contaminated with feces. It attacks the nerves and can kill or paralyze, and can spread widely and unnoticed before it starts crippling children. 'This is a communicable disease - with population movements it can travel to other areas,' said Mr Rosenbauer. 'So the risk is high of spread across the region.' Vaccine: The polio virus, a highly contagious disease, usually infects children in unsanitary conditions through the consumption of food or liquid contaminated with feces (file picture) Syria had launched a vaccination campaign around the country days after the Geneva-based WHO said it had received reports of children showing symptoms of polio in Syria's Deir el-Zour province, but the campaign faces difficulty with lack of access in many parts of the war-torn country. Nearly all Syrian children were vaccinated against the disease before the civil war began more than two years ago. Polio was last reported in Syria in 1999. The Syrian conflict, which began as a largely peaceful uprising against President Bashar Assad in March 2011, has triggered a humanitarian crisis on a massive scale, killing more than 100,000 people, driving nearly 7 million more from their homes and devastating cities and towns. U.N. officials have warned of the spread of disease in Syria because of lack of access to basic hygiene and vaccinations.

Pictured is a truck that exploded in the central Syrian province of Hama, killing at least 30 people and injuring tens of others . A charity has called for a 'vaccination ceasefire' to prevent the polio outbreak turning into an epidemic. Save the Children says half a million children under the age of five in Syria are at risk of contracting the disease and the movement of Syrians to take refuge in neighbouring countries means that there is a high risk the virus could spread across the region. The charity wants a break in the conflict so children can be vaccinated.

Just a day after it emerged that his . mother was being given an inflation-beating five per cent pay rise, . Prince Charles’s annual income is also on the up. Thanks to record profits of £19 . million from the Duchy of Cornwall last year, the heir to the throne . enjoyed an extra £763,000 in his ‘pay packet’, an increase of four per . cent. The rise was clearly welcome as . Charles forked out around £1 million from his personal funds to meet the . growing official activities of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and . Prince Harry. On the buses: The Prince of Wales has cut his travel bill, but is in line for a four per cent income boost . Clarence House declined yesterday to comment on whether the prince is feeling the pinch. But he did make a point of cutting his . personal spending – which includes everything from the salaries of his . private chef and valets, to his and the Duchess of Cornwall’s weekly . supermarket bill – by a substantial £200,000. That amounted to an eight per cent decrease, from £2.6 million to £2.4 million. A spokesman refused to be drawn on why . or how, but in previous years aides have admitted the prince has looked . at bringing down his day-to-day living expenses. His Principle Private . Secretary, William Nye, said yesterday: ‘It’s a whole mixture of things . to do with the way they live their lives.’ Of his £19,051,000 annual income, . Charles was able to write off more than half - £10,952,000 in all – . against tax as business expenses. Clever accounting means that the . future king charges everything from the cost of his offices and staff to . even the upkeep of his gardens at Highgrove, his private home in . Gloucestershire which he also uses for official entertaining, as . legitimate working expenses. Boost: Charles saw his private income from the Duchy of Cornwall rise by four per cent to £19 million . To his credit, however, Charles . continues to voluntarily pay tax, which last year saw a bill from the . Inland Revenue for £4.42 million, marginally down on the previous year. He also received a 47 per cent . decrease in funding from taxpayers to £1.15 million. This is because his . travel bill was significantly cheaper last year, as many of the . countries he visited – including Canada and Australia – also have the . Queen as their head of state and therefore meet the costs of such tours . themselves. Details of the prince’s public and private spending emerged in his annual review, released yesterday. It provides a fascinating insight into the heir to the throne’s household, who works there and how much his lifestyle costs. His Principle Private Secretary, . William Nye, described the last 12 months as an ‘extraordinary year’ and . emphasised Charles’s growing role on the international stage on behalf . of his aging mother, who announced earlier this year she would be . stepping back from long haul royal travel. Mr Nye also admitted that should . William and Kate decide to take on more royal duties in the coming . years, then Charles may have to reconsider his decision to fund their . official work. Demands: Prince Charles had to pay out £1 million from his personal funds to meet the growing official activities of the Prince Harry and the Duchess and Duke of Cambridge . The Duchess of Cornwall’s sister has been paid £1.2million over eight years by Prince Charles for ‘interior design services’. Annabel Elliot received £33,034 in ‘fees and commission’ last year, plus a further £7,160 for the purchase of furniture and furnishings by the Duchy of Cornwall, the accounts show. In all, the interior designer has billed the prince a total of £1,198,629 since she was first  commissioned by the estate in 2005, the year Charles and Camilla married. The Duchy admits the contract for the work was not put out to tender. But it says that, as a  private estate, it is not bound by normal commercial practices and is entitled to award work directly to the prince’s sister-in-law. But he confirmed there were no . immediate plans to do so, suggesting the prince, whose tour of duty as . an RAF Search and Rescue helicopter pilot ends in September, may decide . to stay in the military a little longer despite growing pressure for him . to become a full-time working royal. According to yesterday’s figures the . prince spent £212,000 on Clarence House, his London office and official . residence and £644,000 on official travel by air and rail. He has the equivalent of 125.4 . official full-time staff including 1.3 butlers, 4.3 chefs and kitchen . porters, three chauffeurs, ten house managers and housekeepers and  20.2 . garden and estate workers. He also employs 22.0 staff of a . personal basis including 7.0 secretaries, chefs and valets and 15 . ‘estate, farm, garden and stable staff’. William, Kate and Harry have a further 10.5 full-time office staff paid for by Charles. The Duchy of Cornwall is a private . estate, a portfolio of agricultural land (53,154 hectares of land in 24 . counties at last count) and property such as The Oval cricket ground – . both of which generate vast amounts of rent – as well as some shrewd . financial investments. Pay rise: The Queen, pictured this week with the Grenadier in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, is to receive a five per cent rise in income . Since 1337, the estate’s profits have been given to successive Princes of Wales as the equivalent of an annual income. Clarence House stressed yesterday the . Charles voluntarily chose to use the majority of this money – some . two-thirds in all – to fund his official duties, after which he plays . income tax. But in recent years there has been . growing criticism of this ‘cosy’ arrangement, which is not subject to . either corporation or capital gains taxes. Parliament’s Public Accounts . Committee, which has already hauled businesses including Google and . Starbucks over the coals, is due to question senior figures from the . Duchy and Clarence House over how it works next month.","Prince of Wales sees income from Duchy of Cornwall rise by 4% .

Brooke Wilson-Johnson, of Michigan, handed the money to two nine-year-old boys, who allegedly roughed up the victim, also nine, 'for swearing at Wilson-Johnson'. Wilson-Johnson has been charged with disorderly conduct and aiding and abetting delinquency, after an investigation into the October 7 incident. The incident happend at Campus Elementary School in Grand Rapids, Michigan (pictured) The lunchroom aide was spotted by other staff at Campus Elementary School in Grand Rapids, Michigan, handing a $1 note to a child during the lunch recess. She allegedly wanted to pay students to beat up the victim in retaliation for calling her a 'pregnant b****'. The victim told school officials that he was pushed, bumped, thrown out of seat, and had his food taken. An investigation into the incident showed that he pleaded for help, speaking to teacher Renee Lance. In her report Lane wrote that the victim said: 'Mrs. Lance, you gotta help me! That lunch lady is giving kids a dollar to beat me up.' When Wilson-Johnson was quizzed about the incident by the school principal she denied paying students to carry out the attack. School principal Bernard Colton said when he asked her what happened, she said she was 'playing'. She allegedly admitted the threat to the principal and told him the boy had sworn at her - a claim backed up by other employees, records show. But when police launched their investigation the lunchtime aide denied playing any part in the 'contract' beating. 'The suspect said she never offered any money to the kids to beat up the victim,' according to Detective Mason Klein, in a report based on a phone conversation with Wilson-Johnson. 'She said the principal's statement is a lie. She said she is not a bad person.' Records show that Wilson-Johnson was observed giving one student $1 by a resource teacher, Renee Lance, in the cafeteria. According to the report, Wilson-Johnson said she was going to buy a boy a bag of chips for standing up to the nine-year-old who swore at her, but ended up giving him a dollar instead. She said the boy to whom she gave the dollar never beat up his classmate. According to police three students, instead of two, were involved - two nine-year-old boys and a girl, age 10. The students said Wilson-Johnson gave each of them dollar, according to the police report. Wilson-Johnson, a contracted employee, was fired after the investigation by school chiefs.

A second mystery barge has been discovered - this one docked in Maine, thousands of miles away from the ship spotted in San Fransisco Bay that has set the tech world abuzz. The vessel in Portland Harbor looks nearly identical to its cousin 2,700 miles away in California - four stories of shipping containers welded together atop a large flat barge. They are also both registered to the same mysterious Delaware-based corporation. The ships are widely believed to be owned by Google - built as prototype floating data centers that use ocean water to regulate the intense heat put out by the mass of servers. Mystery: This is the Maine barge that is thought to be part of a floating data center project by Google . This is the San Fransisco barge - which looks strikingly similar to the mysterious ship docked in Portland Harbor . Google has refused to comment on the vessels, though a 2009 patent filed by the company describes an environmentally-friendly sea-powered telecommunications and storage system that looks much like the vessels that have appears on both side of the continent. The Portland Press-Herald reports the Maine barge is docked at the city's Ricker's Warf. Contractors from local engineering firm Cianbro Corp. are installing high-tech equipment in the vessel, though workers said even they didn't know what the purpose of the ship was or who they were working for. Little is known about them, but they appear to have been registered by someone familiar with geek speak - and with a sense of humor. The structures are registered with a Delaware corporation as BAL0001, BAL0010, BAL0011 and BAL0100. In binary code used in computing, the numbers spell out ""one,"" ""two,"" ""three"" and ""four."" Currently, Nos. 1 and 2 are on the water in San Francisco and No. 3 is in Portland Harbor. Also, the Delaware company to which they're registered is called Buy and Large, a likely joking reference to ""Buy N Large,"" the fictional mega-corporation in the 2008 Pixar film 'WALL-E.' The San Francisco barge is docked at Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay . Is this is? A 2009 patent filed by Google shows a water-borne data center . Possible: This large structure on a barge just off Treasure Island, between San Francisco and Oakland, could be a floating data center being made by Google . Google's patent describes 'a system includes a floating platform-mounted computer data center comprising a plurality of computing units, a sea-based electrical generator in electrical connection with the plurality of computing units, and one or more sea-water cooling units for providing cooling to the plurality of computing units.' 'The cutouts in the long walls of the containers, when they line up, they make hallways,' said Joel Egan, who designs similar structures. 'You could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers...It doesn't have enough windows for an office building' Now, CNET investigative reporter Daniel Terdiman claims the mystery construction site floating in San Francisco Bay could belong to Google, drawing on evidence from lease agreements, expert consultations and interviews with locals.

A woman has been ordered to pay more than £4,000 in compensation to the cheated wife of her married lover. Finance manager Naledi Mogae sued Kemiso Dijokota in a Botswana court for 'actively pursuing' her husband while she was away on business. Mrs Mogae, who works for a Christian charity and often has to travel to various locations in southern Africa, claimed that Miss Dijokota would move in and act as a 'wife' in her absence, according to The Voice newspaper in Botswana. Compensation: A judge in Botswana ordered a woman to pay £4,412 in compensation to the wife of her married lover . Mrs Mogae hid cameras in her and her husband Kenneth's bedroom to catch his infidelity. Donga Customary Court president Tebogo Stephen described the evidence as 'watertight and indisputable'. Miss Dijokota had originally pleaded not guilty to wrecking her love rival's marriage, when Mrs Mogae says that her and her husband were working on their nuptials. Although she originally sued for 80,000 pula (£5,883), the judge ordered Miss Dijokota to pay 60,000 pula (£4,412). If the 26-year-old petrol station worker from Francistown fails to pay the debt then her property will be confiscated and sold off so that Mrs Mogae can be paid. Jilted: Mrs Mogae claims that she and her husband Kenneth were working on their marriage when Miss Dijokota targeted him . She has been told to pay 500 pula (£36.80) a month until the compensation is paid. A delighted Mrs Mogae said that she hopes the result of the case will deter other women from targeting married men. According to The Voice, Mr Mogae declined to comment following the case. It is unclear whether the couple managed to save their marriage.","Naledi Mogae sued Kemiso Dijokota for 'actively pursuing' her husband .

A New Jersey man imprisoned for nearly two decades for a murder he said he didn't commit walked out of a federal courthouse on Tuesday, a day after a judge threw out his 1995 conviction over bite-mark evidence. Gerard Richardson, 48, was met by family members and his attorney from the Innocence Project, the organization that got a court-ordered DNA test that showed the bite mark left on the murder victim contained another man's DNA. ‘I'm starting to believe it now, the cold air's hitting me,’ Richardson said as he walked down the steps of the Martin Luther King Jr. federal courthouse after posting $5,000 bail. Gerard Richardson, left, greets his mother, Annie Claybon of Rahway, after hearing that he is to be freed after almost 20 years in prison for a murder he didn't comit . ‘I'm just happy to be home,’ he said. ‘It's been a long road. This is one step closer to me rebuilding my life.’ Richardson was convicted in 1995 of the murder of 19-year-old Monica Reyes, whose body was found in a ditch in Bernards Township in north-central New Jersey. The chief physical evidence included a bite mark on the victim's back that a prosecution expert said was made by Richardson. Bite mark evidence has come under challenge from defense attorneys in recent years, and the Innocence Project says more than two dozen defendants either convicted or charged with rape and murder using bite mark evidence have been exonerated since 2000. Freedom: Gerard Richardson was released from a New Jersey prison on Tuesday after serving 19 years for a murder new DNA evidence shows he didn't commit. He's pictured above with his sister Yvette, left, Innocence Project Senior Staff Attorney Vanessa Potkin and his brother Kevin . Prosecutors in Somerset County did not oppose the decision to throw out Richardson's conviction, but the charges still stand and a state judge has given prosecutors until Dec. 17 to say whether they want to retry him. Richardson admitted he sold drugs in the 1990s and was ‘a young guy doing what I wanted to do, not really living life the way I should have’ at the time of Reyes' murder. But he adamantly denied killing her. ‘I wasn't no angel, but I didn't kill anybody,’ he said. Richardson said he never gave up hope that he would be released someday to rejoin his three daughters, three sons and grandchildren. He was headed to visit his mother in Rahway on Tuesday before driving to his brother's in suburban Philadelphia, where he will live while is out on bail. Richardson's was freed thanks to the support of the Innocence Project, the organization that got a court-ordered DNA test that showed the bite mark left on the murder victim contained another man's DNA . ‘We need to recognize there were two tragedies here,’ said Richardson's older brother, Kevin. ‘Our brother lost time but there was a young person who lost her life.

A mysterious ground shake through parts of southern New Jersey rattled residents around 11am this morning leaving bewildered residents still without answers. Both the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service reported no earthquake having occurred in the area and the nearby military base claiming to have had no training exercises that would have caused the tremors. The USGS has since speculated that the shake felt by residents in southern counties for an estimated 15 seconds was from a sonic boom. Reports: A map by the USGS shows the coloured counties where the shake was reported on Saturday, seen the most through the southern coast . The effect would be a 'thunder-like noise a person on the ground hears when an aircraft or other type of aerospace vehicle files overhead faster than the speed of sound or supersonic,' according to NASA. An officer with the Sea Isle City Police Department said they had not confirmed it having been a sonic boom as reported by local news reports but told MailOnline it was a 'non-event.' The shake was reported in several counties including Atlantic, Cape May, Ocean, Salem and Camden. 'I'm in [Little Egg Harbor] and my basement door shook violently for 15 sec or so long enough to creep me out. Sounded like someone was trying to get out,' a resident wrote on the Facebook page for Jersey Shore Hurricane News. 'My dog whelped two times before it happened I had thought he hurt himself. Then the huge noise boomed and my house shook slightly. It felt like it came from above,' a claimed Northfield resident wrote. Last weekend Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst had advised residents of scheduled military training that could cause booms and ground tremors. Base spokesman Pascual Flores told NBC News that wasn't the case for today. 'There currently is no training of any type that would have resulted in today's incident,' he said. Eager to suggest other causes for the tremor, residents on Facebook pitched ideas consisting of: Fracking, ‘Romney dropped his BINDERS,’ Governor Chris Christie jogging, and 'Snookie fell off a barstool.'","The U.S. Geological Survey has speculated the shake was from a sonic boom .

Deadly partying: Kinara Patel, 18, died after a drinking binge that began and ended in a Villanova University dorm room . Police are piecing together the ‘mystery’ night two months ago that ended a teenager’s life after she drank too much alcohol while partying. Kinara Patel, 18, of Hackensack, New Jersey, was found dead in a dorm room at around 10am on August 29, just three days after she returned from summer vacation to start her sophomore year at Villanova University, Philadelphia. Patel’s drinking binge began in Sullivan Hall, one of the largest dorms on campus which houses 400 students. She then continued the night with friends at Maloney’s Pub in Bryn Mawr, which is known for allowing minors into the premises. Patel and other students went back to the dorm afterwards and continued drinking there. She was found dead at 9.50am the next morning. The Delaware County medical examiner said she died of acute alcohol poisoning, according to Philly.com. Police say they do not know much Patel drank at Maloney’, and according to friends and a cabdriver who took the students back to Villanova, she didn't appear drunk. ‘She should have been staggering, and she wasn't,’ Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan said. In fact, he said, the friend who was with her ‘was in worse shape’. Not staggering: According to friends and a cabdriver who took the students back to Villanova, Patel didn't appear drunk . Dead: She was found unresponsive at around 10am on August 29 in a dorm room in Sullivan Hall, which houses 400 students . Authorities have not released her blood-alcohol content, but the autopsy report says the 5-foot-2 Patel ingested a lethal quantity of ethanol. ‘How she consumed that much alcohol remains a mystery,’ Whelan said, adding that no criminal charges would be brought in connection with her death. Patel had used a fake driver's license to get into Maloney's, a Villanova hangout, according to police. She was there from midnight to 2am. The bar has a history of serving minors, according to authorities. Lower Merion police arrested people for underage drinking or providing false IDs in November 2012, February 2013, and September 2013, police Capt. William Boegley said. The state police Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement cited the bar in June 2012 and July 2013 for serving underage drinkers. Illegal: Patel used a fake ID to get into Maloney's Pub, a Villanova hangout, where she is believed to have stayed for two hours drinking alcohol . Piecing together the night: How she consumed that much alcohol remains a 'mystery', say police . On August 26, three days before Patel died, an age-compliance check was conducted at the bar and a minor was turned away, spokesman Trooper Adam Reed said. ‘All the Villanova students, they're at the bars and they've got very good IDs out there now,’ Boegley said. Colarulo, the Radnor superintendent, said Patel had a ‘very authentic-looking’ driver's license. Villanova has said it provides several alcohol-education programs for students, but has not made any changes on campus following Patel's death. Its student code of conduct outlines sanctions for underage drinking, although like many universities, the school has a medical amnesty policy, spokesman Jonathan Gust said. ‘The loss of even one student is too many. To lose someone so young is heartbreaking, and Kinara Patel's death was a tremendous loss for the entire Villanova community,’ he said.

On October 5, Lower Merion police cited 75 people for underage drinking at an apartment building at 801 Montgomery Ave. Almost all attended the university, Boegley said.

Swedish police have come under fire after revelations that the nation’s most dangerous serial killer is a compulsive liar who made up confessions to 30 murders. Seen as exceptional crime solvers thanks to the fictional Swedish detective Inspector Wallander, Swedish police have been left red-faced after a book about notorious serial killer Thomas Quick claims he simply made up his confessions and police took his word. Quick was jailed in 1990 for armed robbery and during his compulsory psychotherapy sessions he confessed to murders in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. He has been convicted of eight murders between 1976 and 1885 and confessed to another 25. Serial killer or serial liar? Thomas Quick was thought to be Sweden's most dangerous serial killer but a book published this month claims that his confessions were all lies . Investigative journalist and author Hannes Råstam claims that Quick, 62, collected details about unsolved murders across Scandinavia from a Stockholm library while on day release and began confessing to crimes. With his research Quick was able to describe details such as murder weapons, details about victims’ clothes and their appearance. According to Råstam, the police who were eager to close the unsolved murder files took his confessions as fact. When he was formally charged, Quick and . his lawyers were given access to even more detailed information from . prosecution documents enabling him to cultivate his confessions further. Confessions are lies: Hannes Råstam's book The case of Thomas Quick: the creation of a serial murderer claims that Quick's murder confessions have misled Swedish police in several murder cases . Now the families of victims are calling for a parliamentary commission, demanding police find the real killers who remain unpunished. Bjoern Asplund, whose 11-year-old son disappeared in 1980, said regulations are needed to prevent this happening again. Quick . claimed to have strangled the boy and was convicted of his murder but . has since been acquitted. Johan’s body has never been found. According to The Times Mr Asplund said: ‘The parliamentarians have got to get to the bottom of why and how so much went wrong.’ As the tide of public opinion has . turned, Swedes have been lining up to buy the book The case of Thomas . Quick: the creation of a serial murderer, to discover how a judicial . system could be so easily and badly be misled. The book was published . this month not long after the author died of cancer. Quick became the most ruthless murderer . in Scandinavian history after he told psychotherapists in several . therapy sessions how he strangled, raped and stabbed victims, even . chopping some up and eating them. While it is unclear why he confessed to . such horrific crimes, Quick says he was often affected by strong, . mood-altering drugs during police interrogations. Psychiatrists say he was a compulsive liar who believed he was a hero for helping grateful police close many unsolved murders. Swedish police left red-faced: If right, the accusations show a judicial system far from the crime solving reputation Swedish police have gained thanks to TV series Wallander, featuring Sir Kenneth Branagh as Inspector Wallander . But during TV interviews with Råstam in the mental institution where Quick was serving his life sentence in 2008, the convicted killer retracted his many confessions leaving many unsure whether to believe him or not. In the description of Råstam’s book The case of Thomas Quick: the creation of a serial murderer, the author’s research made him uncertain about Quick’s confessions. It reads: ‘The answer to the mystery of Thomas Quick turned out to be more terrifying than the man himself.’ According to The Times, Mr Quick is now hoping for an early release from the institution. He said: ‘It has been liberating to tell the truth.’","Convicted serial killer Thomas Quick was convicted of eight murders and confessed to another 25 .

An airline has infuriated many with a casting call for a commercial looking only for light skinned people. AeroMexico and ad agency Catatonia have been forced to apologize after a casting call was sent out for an airline commercial saying dark-skinned people would not be allowed. The casting call specifically asked for people who looked like they came from a wealthy neighborhood of Mexico City. Not-so-friendly skies: AeroMexico only wanted light-skinned people for a recent casting call . Mexican Blogger Tamara De Anda took a picture of the casting call and tweeted it August 8 to her over 19,000 followers, causing a firestorm of criticism to rain down on the two companies. Backpedalling from the original request, both companies moved to distance themselves from the notice, even blaming it on an unidentified third company. The casting call, in Spanish, said ‘nadie Moreno,’ meaning no dark-skinned people would be allowed. Additionally, it asked specifically for ‘Polanco’ looking people, a refence to the well-heeled Mexico-City area. Taking it one step further, the notice also barred blonde-haired, blue eyed people from appearing. De Anda, in a post to her blog translated from Spanish, explained it was just another example of the blatant racism seen in the country. ‘Outside of government program announcements, NGOs, ‘folkloric’ tourism foundations about ‘our native cultures,’ brown people do not exist. In general, not only are indigenous people deleted (unless they appear in their traditional costumes).’ Nadie moreno: The ad specifically barred dark-skinned people from auditioning . Shortly after De Anda posted the blog entry, her phone became inundated with calls from a phone number she did not recognize, according to an update to the original blog entry. When she finally answered, she was told she violated a confidentiality agreement and that there could be legal consequences. Not long after the post, the ad agency apologized for the discriminatory search. ‘Catatonia offers a heartfelt apology for the publication on casting requirements that circulated on social networks,’ the company said in a statement. ‘The language used by the casting company that made the publication was inadequate.’ AeroMexico was also quick to apologize, but left the ad agency to shoulder the blame. ‘We are sorry for Catatonia’s discriminatory stance… we offer our sincerest apology and reiterate our respect for all people, no matter their gender, language, religion, nor their skin color,’ the airline said in a statement posted to Twitter. An apology: 'We are sorry for the discriminatory stance taken by Catatonia' said this apology posted to Twitter . Disadvantaged: A far greater portion of dark-skinned people, versus light-skinned people, live below the poverty line in Mexico . In Mexico, as in many Latin American countries, the majority of actors and other personalities on TV, in movies and advertisements being light-skinned and the majority of the wealth concentrated with light-skinned  people, race is a sensitive issue. ‘On television, in politics and in academia, you see light-skinned people… In the priciest neighborhoods, the homeowners have light skin, and the housekeepers are dark. Everyone knows this, and yet no one talks about it, at least not in elite circles,’ Ruben Navarrette Jr., wrote in a 2012 CNN op-ed. Though discrimination is illegal south of the border, 93 per cent of Mexico City residents responding to a government survey said they believed there was discrimination in hiring on the basis of race, according to the Latin Times. Additionally, while most people in Mexico can trace their lineage to some combination of indigenous ancestors, and 6.7 million speak an indigenous language, 80 per cent of darker-skinned people live below the poverty line, according to a separate study. AeroMexico has not responded to multiple requests for comment.","The ad asked for people who looked like they are from Polanco, a wealthy Mexico City neighborhood .

Indonesian police made a shocking discovery during a murder investigation at a luxury villa when they stumbled over an illegal private zoo. Officers had been called to the home in the Sukaraia district of Bogar, in west Java, after a security guard confessed to a colleague that he had cut a young woman's throat after she spurred his advances and buried her body in the grounds. Instead, they found the zoo containing an endangered Sumatran tiger, several types of monkeys and a liger - a lion-tiger crossbreed. Liger, liger: The investigation into an alleged murder at a luxury villa in Indonesia saw officers stumble upon an illegal zoo housing a liger - a half lion/half tiger . The bizarre set of circumstances were still being investigated last night as police in Indonesia searched for the owner of the villa where the young murder victim is believed to have been living, possibly as an employee. Detectives went to the villa, after one of the security guards, named as 31-year-old Slamet Pujiharto, confessed to another guard that he had murdered the woman, known only as Eneng, 28, because she had resisted his sexual advances. After his arrest, Pujiharto was reported by the Jakarta Globe as confessing: ‘I asked her to have sex with me and she refused. ‘When I forced her, she scraped my face, which upset me. So I ran and took a knife and then slashed her throat with it four times.’ The guard, who said his role at the zoo was to also feed the animals, said that after the murder he had buried the woman’s body in the villa grounds. Clues in the claws: Police are investigation the murder and are hunting the owner of the villa where an endangered Sumatran tiger was part of the menagerie . Monkey business: The zoo was also home to a javan langur, left, and two siamang monkeys, right . It is believed that the murder victim and the guard were both employed at the villa which housed several peacocks as well as the rare predators and monkeys . His confession led to police raiding the property - and they were astonished to find animals there that most officers had never seen in their lives. They included a critically-endangered Sumatran tiger, a Java gibbon, a langur monkey, a dusky leaf monkey, two siamang apes three Java peacocks - and the liger. Now police are hunting for the owner, who was not at the villa when detectives arrived. But he, or she, is expected to be charged with keeping an illegal zoo. ‘Sancturaries that get permits to breed wild animals are conservation institutions like registered zoos, safari parks or breeding centres,’ an official of the Bogar Natural Resources Conservation Centre, told the Jakarta Globe. The major concern was for the Sumatran tiger, whose species is critically endangered with only an estimated 400 to 500 existing in the wild. We bought a zoo: The villa is located in the Sukaraia district of Bogor (pictured) on west Java . But vets said the villa’s Sumatran tiger was ‘healthy enough,’ and would be moved to other zoos with the rest of the animals - all except the liger. ‘The presence of a new animal is not due to a natural cause and it exists because of human intervention,’ said the official. ‘There are no regulations on it, so we are suggesting that the liger be terminated.’ His comments have outraged animal lovers throughout Indonesia. ‘Is there no zoological garden which could care for this liger instead of terminating it?’ asked one writer. ‘Don’t kill the liger - it’s innocent,’ said another. Yet another writer said the suggestion that the liger would be put down was ‘a weird attitude for a conservationist. The “go” solution is to kill it?…If anything, take the liger and put it in a zoo.’","Zoo discovered after guard admitted to murdering woman in Indonesian villa .

Councillors in an impoverished Chinese village have been criticised for splashing out on a Sydney Opera House-style building which has been used only to store crops . Local councillors in Haian county, in Jiangsu province, were given a grant intended to transform the under-developed area into an ecological park. But it appears all the money has been spent on a small but lavishly-designed waterside building that replicates the iconic Sydney Opera House. Rip-off? Chinese officials in the poor county of Haian deny they have wasted grant money on a waterside building that looks like Sydney Opera House . Greenhouse: The money was intended to transform Haian into an ecological centre, but instead they got a lavish building . Officials however strongly deny the copycat claims and say the building was built as a greenhouse. The empty structure, that looks out of place among the rundown houses in the neighbourhood, has been unused and empty for four years. So local farmers decided it was the perfect place to keep crops dry over winter, which has become the building's default purpose. Managers of the newly-created . ecological park claim that the building was not an attempt to create a . copy based on the Opera House. The resemblance with the 'ecological' building in Haian to the Sydney Opera House, pictured, has been noticed by many, who have criticised councillors for wasting money . They said it was to be a giant greenhouse to be used as a nursery for planting exotic crops for the local fields. Most critics have dismissed this however, pointing to the restricted light and limited floor space inside the building. With . just 120 square metres, they point out that it wouldn't be very . practical, since hardly any young plants could be raised there. The money was supposed to benefit local people in the under-developed area. It was used to build the striking building, which has laid empty for four years . But park spokesman Jian Tien was adamant that they had not been wasting money by creating buildings that were copies of something more famous elsewhere: 'We built it to look like a booming flower, and not as a copycat as the Sydney opera house. 'I know it has been unused for some time but we will put it into use soon, and not leave it unused any longer.'","Haian councillors criticised for wasting money on lavish waterside building .

With his playing career over, former England captain David Beckham has decided his next move: starting a Major League Soccer team in Miami. Since leaving the Los Angeles Galaxy in December, and retiring from the game after a subsequent five-month stint at Paris Saint-Germain, Beckham has been mulling over the location for his MLS franchise. Beckham has now made up his mind and he would pay a discounted rate of $25 million to start an MLS expansion team in Miami, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press on Tuesday. He's baaaaack: David Beckham, who signed a monster contract with the LA Galaxy in 2007, is returning to the U.S. to found a new soccer franchise . The person spoke on condition of anonymity because plans for the team aren't being publicly discussed yet. The option of becoming a team owner was included in the MLS contract Beckham signed when joining the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007. 'We know that Miami is one of the most passionate soccer markets in North America,' MLS Executive Vice President Dan Courtemanche told the AP. Partner: 'American Idol' creator Simon Fuller is one of Beckham's key business partners in the $25million deal . 'We have met with David Beckham regarding ownership of an expansion team, and we look forward to David one day owning an MLS club. There are currently 19 MLS teams, and league commissioner Don Garber hopes to expand to 24 teams by the 2020 season. A 20th team is already in place to begin playing in 2015 after Premier League club Manchester City and its partner, the New York Yankees, paid an expansion fee of $100 million to launch New York City FC. The MLS still has to give Beckham the go-ahead to make Miami the location of the franchise. Beckham is looking to raise several hundred million dollars of investment to fund the setup costs, including putting together the squad of players and building a stadium. Beckham's business partner Simon Fuller, the 'American Idol' creator who is the driving force in franchise negotiations, will be a significant shareholder, the person familiar with the situation said. Beckham is looking to sell stakes in the team to other investors, and has already had expressions of interest from businessmen globally. Beckham hopes the team to debut in three years, which would likely require the franchise to initially play in an existing venue. In June, Beckham toured the Sun Life and Florida International University stadiums and met with Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez. Expanding: The MLS already has 19 teams and has a 20th - New York FC - signed on . University officials delivered a presentation to Beckham and Marcelo Claure, president and CEO of Brightstar Corp. and a member of the FIU Board of Trustees, explaining the draw of a professional team in Miami. Before deciding on Miami as the franchise location, Beckham explored options in other cities, including Montreal, San Diego and Orlando, the person said. Miami has had a Major League Soccer team before. The Miami Fusion held matches in Fort Lauderdale from 1998 to 2001, before shutting down because of poor attendance. As a former Manchester United, Real Madrid and AC Milan midfielder, Beckham hopes his star power will make a team work there. Beckham's management team said it is not ready yet to make an announcement about Beckham's franchise ownership option.","David Beckham received option to buy a team franchise when he signed 2007 contract with LA Galaxy .

The grieving widow of a the Sparks, Nevada school teacher tragically slain by a student last week has broken her silence to describe the last touching moments she shared with her husband. Sharon Landsberry was usually asleep as her math teacher husband Michael, 45, left for work each day. But on October 21, she was awake to share a goodbye Sharon had no idea would be their last. ‘The last words I heard from him was 'Have a good day my beautiful wife,’ Landsberry said. Widowed: Sharon Landsberry has broken her silence about the final touching moments she shared with her heroic teacher husband Michael, who was gunned down October 21 in a Sparks, Nevada school shooting . Loving: Michael left a Post-It note for his wife every morning on his way to work as she slept . Landsberry spoke for the first time Tuesday about that faithful morning and about her husband’s usual habit of leaving a Post-It on her coffee cup with a loving message as she slept. ‘The coffee would be ready, he'd get my coffee cup out and put a sticky note on it and write, “Hey my beautiful wife” or “Have a good day, I love you.” It was always different,’ she told KTVN. Landsberry appears remarkably upbeat in the interview in which she calls her late husband, ‘my everything.’ ‘I can't wait to be home with you and go for our walk. I love you,’ Michael said to Sharon before he left. While those loving words were remain only in Sharon’s memory, the Nevada widow still has his daily morning messages. She saved every one of the sticky notes, and is now glad she did. An hour after they parted ways, shots broke out at Sparks Middle School. ‘When I first heard this going and I didn't get a text message back from him, I knew...I knew exactly what he did,’ she told KTVN. ‘I knew he stepped in front.’ Her husband, a former Marine and an Air National Guardsman, tried to stop 12-year-old Jose Reyes’ rampage with a 9mm Ruger and died for his heroics. Love notes: Sharon Landsberry saved each and every Post-It note her slain husband left on her coffee cup over the years and she's now glad she did . 'I had a love that most people will never ever experience': Sharon says her husband's maxim was to stay forever positive. Now she and her daughters are trying to live out his words by turning his death into a positive thing . ‘He's always said and he's told the kids that he would protect them and that's exactly what he did,’ she said. ‘He would do it for anyone he loved.’ His loved ones included his adoring wife, but also her daughters, who he’s now left behind. But in spite of her massive loss, Sharon manages to stay positive, something she says her husband always insisted she and the girls do. ¿I knew he stepped in front': Sharon says her husband's first priority was always the safety of his students and family and that she knew he'd put his life on the line as soon as she got word of the October 21 shooting . ‘I had a love that most people will never ever experience and I'm so grateful that I got the chance to experience it with him,’ she said. ‘We'll continue to move forward just like Mike would want us to do and be strong and do something positive out of what happened.’ As for her last words to Michael: ‘I love you too,’ she told him. ‘You have a good day and he walked out the door.’ Landsberry coached basketball and soccer and was known as a big fan of Batman.","Michael Landsberry left a loving note for his sleeping wife Sharon every day when he left for work .

The prostitution scandal centered on a Zumba studio in a picture-perfect New England village that shocked the sensibilities of residents and generated international headlines is rapidly drawing to a close. The final five cases are awaiting resolution and that could happen in coming weeks, either with pleas or trials. After that, no further prosecutions are anticipated because judges ruled that the woman at the heart of the scandal, Alexis Wright, cannot be forced to testify. 'Based on the rulings that the court has made in the last two trials regarding the testimony of Alexis Wright, we won't be proceeding with any other charges,' said Justina McGettigan, deputy district attorney in Maine's York County. Guilty: Alexis Wright, seen in prison orange at left and in a strip-tease video she made in her studio at right, was sentenced to 10 months in jail after pleading guilty to numerous charges . Wright ran her prostitution business, servicing up to 150 clients, out of her Zumba exercise studio in downtown Kennebunk, Maine . The allegations of prostitution gained attention a year ago with reports of as many as 100 to 150 clients videotaped without their knowledge in Kennebunk, a seaside community known more for its beaches, historic homes and New England charm than for crime. Wright's business partner watched the sex acts unfold on a live video stream. In the end, charges were brought against 68 people accused of being clients. Those included a former mayor, a minister, a lawyer and a firefighter. Many cases were slam dunks because prosecutors had video footage or photos showing money changing hands. But without those images, Wright's testimony or other evidence of money changing hands, prosecutors didn't have enough evidence to pursue charges against the remainder of people allegedly on Wright's ledger. Mark Strong, pictured right leaving court with his attorney, was sentenced to 20 days in jail after he was convicted of aiding Wright prostitution ring . All told, 60 of them pleaded guilty or no contest, and one was convicted by a jury. Prosecutors elected not to pursue charges against the only woman to be accused of using Wright's services, and one case ended in acquittal, according to documents obtained under Maine's Freedom of Access Act. Five more cases are on the docket. Wright, 30, of Wells, avoided trial by pleading guilty to charges of prostitution, as well as several welfare- and tax-related charges. She was sentenced to 10 months behind bars and is due to be released from jail by year's end. The former single mother was accused of conspiring with insurance business owner Mark Strong to run the prostitution business. Detailed records over an 18-month period indicating she made $150,000 tax-free. She also collected more than $40,000 in public assistance.

The Florida man accused of murdering former NFL star Sean Taylor during a botched 2007 robbery told jurors Monday he was coerced by police into confessing – that he’s not a killer. Eric Rivera, 17-years-old when the footballer was shot dead in his Miami Home, argued he never left the SUV his friends took to the home. He had no idea anyone had been shot until the band of thieves rushed back to the SUV and sped away, he claimed. This shocking insistence comes after he admitted to police that he shot Mr Taylor and tossed the gun in the Everglades on the way home, the Miami Herald reported, detailing the accused killer’s testimony. Scroll down for video . 'I didn't do it': Eric Rivera takes the stand in his own defense during his murder trial . Mr Rivera, on the stand testifying in his own defense, denied knowing why the group took the drive from Fort Myers, on Florida’s west coast, to Miami, where Mr Taylor lived. Mr Taylor played for the University of Miami prior to joining the NFL’s Washington Redskins.‘Did I know we were going to Sean Taylor’s house? No,’ Mr Rivera asserted. The 24-year-old then told jurors he only learned of the plot as the SUV sped across Alligator Alley. Vowing he wanted no money from the caper, he never left the vehicle, Mr Rivera added. Mr Rivera maintained that he only learned of the shooting after his three friends raced back to the truck, and claimed Venjah Hunte was the shooter. Mr Hunt has already pleaded guilty for his part in the robbery gone wrong, the paper noted. Too soon: Mr Taylor died in the infancy of his pro career, and left behind a newborn daughter . Due to face what is expected to be a tough cross-examination Tuesday, Mr Rivera’s testimony was an effort to prove he pressed by police to falsely confess, according to the paper. Mr Taylor died as a result of massive blood loss after being shot in the leg, a murder that horrified football fans and non-fans alike. Authorities have long asserted Mr Rivera is the one who fired the bullet into Mr Taylor’s leg, a claim he now denies. Investigators taped a confession that showed Mr Rivera admitting to the killing, and to tossing the murder weapon into the Everglades, a vast expanse of Florida swampland. Shocking: Mr Taylor's murder shocked the country, both football fans and non-fans alike . Officials pieced together a scenario that has Mr Rivera and company ambushing the football player in his home – they did not expect him to be there. Mr Taylor grabbed a machete to protect his infant daughter and girlfriend, leading to him being shot, said investigators. Initially confessing to the crime, Mr Rivera now says he did it only under intense pressure from police. ‘I was concerned about my moms. I was concerned about my family,’ Rivera testified. ‘It was to the point that I felt like it wasn’t going to stop.’ Police disputed those accusations. The trial resumed Tuesday and is expected to last at least a few more days.","Eric Rivera has been accused of shooting Sean Taylor dead .

A former teacher has been jailed for 10 years for ignoring a court order not to contact a teenager she had a yearlong affair with. Kelly O'Rourke, 42, was told to have no contact with her victim after pleading guilty in January to a charge of sexual assault. She was given a 15-year sentence but told she would only serve 120 days. One of the conditions of her plea deal was that the volleyball coach did not have any further contact with her teenage victim, according to Arkansas Matters. But while in prison O'Rourke repeatedly telephoned the girl more than 50 times. All the calls recorded by prison staff and were played for Pulaski County Circuit Judge Barry Sims who had presided over her original trial earlier in the year. He told O'Rourke that he had to come down 'pretty hard' on her because she had called the girl repeatedly since her initial sentencing. 'You had no intention of following these orders,' Sims told O'Rourke. Sims said he listened to recordings of calls O'Rourke made to the girl from jail and said she was being disrespectful toward the court. O'Rourke admitted making the calls when she appeared before Judge Pulaski at a court in Little Rock, Arkansas. In one she told the victim she wanted her 'in her life' as her girlfriend. This is Mount St. Mary Academy in Little Rock where Kelly O'Rourke met her victim . Room mate: The school's athletic director Kathy Griffin was also suspended as she failed to tell staff about the affair. She also lived with O'Rourke . 'I . am remorseful, ashamed and regret my behavior in disrespecting the . court's orders,' she said before being sentenced to 10 years. O'Rourke began the affair with a 16 year old student in 2010 while teaching at Mount St. Mary Academy in Little Rock. After school officials were tipped off about the affair O'Rourke was suspended. The affair ended in 2011 when the girl graduated from school. The school's athletic director Kathy Griffin was also suspended as she failed to tell staff about the affair. O'Rourke and Griffin lived together. Griffin was sentenced to a year of probation after being convicted last month of failing to report the relationship. The victim was 16 when the abuse began in 2010 and graduated from high school the next year at age 17. She is now an adult and Sims lifted the no-contact order. As part of the original sentence O'Rourke has had to register as a sex offender, provide a sample of her DNA and pay $5,000 in court costs. She was also obligated to testify against Griffin.","Former Mount St. Mary Academy teacher Kelly O'Rourke jailed for 10 years for contacting female sexual assault victim, despite no contact order .

Yesterday, a translator was moved to tears when she heard the family's account. In a testimony 13-year-old Zubair, told Congress: 'My grandmother was nobody’s enemy. 'She was kind and caring. She used to help the mothers in my village deliver their babies. 'In the evening, she would tell all of the children to gather around and she would tell us stories. Mamana Bibi, who was killed in a US-led drone strike in north western Pakistan last October . Stories of her life, of our family, of our community. She had so many stories that I can’t pick a favourite. I miss all of them.' The family is being represented by human rights group Reprieve and their legal representative Jennifer Gibson.

She was the string that held our family together. Since . her death, the string has been broken and life has not been the same. 'We . feel alone and we feel lost. We also feel scared. 'My family no longer gathers together . like it did when my mother was alive. I hardly see my brothers and . sisters and my children rarely see their cousins.

A rural Tennessee man shot a teenager armed only with toilet paper. One of a group of teens toilet papering his principal’s home Oct 20 was peppered by several pellets that came from a gun fired by neighbour Dale Farris, officials said. The teens were papering the yard of Huntland School principal Ken Bishop, an Estill Springs neighbour of Mr Farris, according to the Times Free Press. ‘Some kids got out at a residence over there to roll it with toilet paper and this gentleman came out of his residence a couple of houses over and shot one of the teenagers who was rolling this other guy's yard,’ a Franklin County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson told the paper. Mr Farris, 65, fired at least two shots at the pranksters, striking a 15-year-old in the right foot, inner left knee, right palm, right thigh and right side of his torso, the Times Free Press said. ‘He got peppered pretty good,’ the spokesperson said. ‘The problem is they were not on his [Farris'] property and they were not doing anything to his property.’ Some of the teens involved attend the school Mr Bishop presides over as principal, the report noted. He declined to press charges against anyone involved. Authorities charged the vigilante with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment. He was released from custody after posting a $125,000 bond, according to the Times Free Press. When reached for comment by MailOnline, Mr Farris snarled ‘don’t bother me’ and slammed his phone down. Mr Farris has no prior criminal history, according to court records. He is due in court again Dec 5.A sheriff’s office spokesperson could not be reached for further comment.

An ex-football player turned personal trainer shot and killed a man in a Whole Foods Market car park in Carrollwood, Florida, on Tuesday morning. David Saunders, 37, who played for the Tampa Bay Storm between 2002 and 2005, was questioned by police but hasn’t been arrested. Saunders claims he fired in self defense because the other man was coming at him with a knife. Ex-football player turned personal trainer David Saunders shot and killed a man in a Whole Foods Market car park in Carrollwood, Florida, on Tuesday morning . The dead man has been named as Deshaun Gregory, 31, of Tampa. He died of a single gunshot to the head. ‘Two men were involved in a verbal altercation and one fired a round at the other, killing him,’ sheriff’s spokesman Larry McKinnon told The Tampa Tribune. The altercation is believed to have been related to Gregory’s girlfriend, who was being personally trained by Saunders. She was also present at the crime scene and hasn’t been named because she is a witness in the on-going investigation, said McKinnon. The altercation took place on Tuesday morning in a Whole Foods car park and is believed to have been related to Deshaun Gregory's girlfriend, who was being personally trained by David Saunders . When police arrived they found Gregory’s body lying in the lot next to Saunders’ white sport-utility vehicle. Police believe Gregory and his girlfriend had been parked in the Whole Foods’ lot arguing about Saunders. Gregory spotted Saunders in his vehicle behind the store and walked across the parking lot to confront the personal trainer, who had gotten out of his vehicle, McKinnon said. At some point, Gregory pulled an 8-inch kitchen knife and began moving toward Saunders, McKinnon said. They fought and during the struggle, a shot was fired by Saunders, he said. Detectives are looking into the backgrounds of the three to determine what may have motivated the incident. David Saunders, who played for the Tampa Bay Storm between 2002 and 2005, was questioned by police but hasn’t been charged . When police arrived they found Deshaun Gregory's body lying in the lot next to David Saunders' white sport-utility vehicle . The investigation will be turned over to the Hillsborough County State Attorney’s Office, which will review the case to determine if criminal charges will be filed.

After leaving the Mountaineers in 1998, he left football for two years, but signed with the New Jersey Red Dogs of the Arena Football League in 2000. He began playing with the Storm two years later and was named the team’s Most Valuable Player in 2002. In 2003, he was part of the Storm’s AFL ArenaBowl XVII championship team.

The family of a boy from New Mexico has filed a lawsuit against a police officer who they say used his Taser gun on the 10-year-old as punishment for refusing to clean his patrol car during a school career day. A photo of the victim's chest that was released on Saturday shows what appear to be bruises resembling cigarette burns from the Taser's prongs that pierced his chest. The alleged victim, identified only as R.D., passed out after receiving a 50,000-volt jolt of electricity while attending the event at Tularosa Intermediate School in May. Tasered: A 10-year-old boy (pictured) passed out after receiving a 50,000 volt jolt of electricity to his chest . The lawsuit was filed on October 26 by the boy's court-appointed guardian against officer Chris Webb, who has been charged with battery, failure to render emergency medical care, unreasonable seizure and excessive force. According to the court filing, on May 4, police officers drove onto the school campus, where Webb asked a group of boys which one of them would like to clean his vehicle, ABC News reported. R.D. raised his hand and jokingly said that he did not want to clean the car. In response, the suit claims that Webb leveled his Taser at the child before saying: 'Let me show you what happens to people who do not listen to the police.' He then allegedly stunned R.D. Shocking: A police officer allegedly used his Taser gun on the 10-year-old as punishment for refusing to clean his patrol car . Attorney Shannon Kennedy who represents the boy’s family said that instead of calling paramedics who were on campus for the career day, Webb pulled the barbs from the Taser out of the boy’s chest. ‘He grabbed the wires, he yanked them and it came out of the prongs, and then he went up to me and he ripped the prongs out of my chest,’ R.D. told ABC News in September. The boy said the officer then took him to the restroom to clean up and then to the nurses office. ‘R.D.’s mother arrived at the school in absolute shock and rushed him to the emergency room,’ said Kennedy. Incident: The boy was shocked during a careers day at the Tularosa New Mexico Intermediate School . In the aftermath of the incident, the attorney said R.D. is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. ‘He wakes up in the middle of the night holding his chest afraid his heart will stop,’ said Kennedy. ‘He says, “Mommy I’m afraid I’ll never wake up again.”’ However, a police report filed by Webb tells an entirely different story. According to the document, Webb said a group of students had asked him to show them his Taser gun, and when he pulled it out, it accidentally went off and hit the 10-year-old in the chest. Webb stated in the report that he immediately shut off the power switch, removed the cartridge and threw the stun gun to the ground. Both the New Mexico Department of Public Safety and Webb are being sued, with R.D.’s guardian looking for punitive damages for battery, failure to arrange emergency medical care, excessive force, negligent hiring, training, supervision and retention and unreasonable seizure. 'No reasonable officer confronting a situation where the need for force is at its lowest, on a playground with elementary age children, would have deployed the Taser in so reckless a manner as to cause physical and psychological injury,’ Higgins said.","10-year-old allegedly hit with 50,000 volt weapon by Officer Chris Webb .

Speaking with police: Bardstown High School principal Chris Pickett has been identified as a 'person of interest' in the theft of $26,000 in rare bourbon . A high school principal has been named a 'person of interest' in the theft of $26,000 in rare bourbon from a Kentucky distillery last week. Bardstown High School principal Chris Pickett was identified after allegedly trying to sell a 'large quantity' of Pappy Van Winkle to a liquor store on Sunday afternoon — a claim he denies. Pickett's lawyer, Doug Hubbard, said his client was a liquor collector who merely asked clerks at Elizabethtown's Packages and More Liquors whether any Pappy was available. He said Pickett told the store’s manager he 'had quite a bit and wanted to add to his collection.' However, store owner Eric Hall claims Pickett, identified in surveillance footage, tried to offload the premium liquor. 'He talked to my manager [Ben Beach], offered to sell some to my employee, or us, and my employee stated he couldn't buy it except from a distributor,' Hall told WDRB.com. 'The man kind of turned around, clammed up and left.' Hall said it was 'ironic' someone would try to offload a product reported stolen just five days earlier. Pickett met with police on Monday. Franklin County Sheriff Pat Melton said Pickett was 'very cooperative'. 'There’s still a conflict in the story there,' said Melton. 'Nobody has been ruled out now [as a person of interest].'

According to The Atlantic Wire, only about 7,000 cases of Pappy Van Winkle are bottled each year, meaning 'it’s gone in recent years from a niche item favored by a cult of bourbon connoisseurs to an object of fervor, hunted by an ever-growing number of devotees the way Paris pursued Helen of Troy.' Melton said authorities were originally investigating the heist as an inside job. The bourbon was stored in a secure area to which at least 50 employees have access.

'Ridiculous': Alfie Waine and his mother Emma Hardy were unimpressed by security staff at Leeds Bradford Airport who confiscated the five-year-old's toy weapons . Airport security staff seized a five-year-old's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle toys - because they look like imitation weapons. Staff at Leeds Bradford Airport confiscated the colourful toys - an eight inch plastic Leonardo sword, a Donatello staff and a silver light up laser handgun - when Alfie Waine went through security with his mother Emma Hardy. Workers at the West Yorkshire airport wouldn't let the youngster take the toys on a flight to Dublin in his mother's hand luggage as they breached security regulations. Ms Hardy, 31, said: 'It's ridiculous. They just need to think sensibly about this. 'The flight is not going to be held up by a five-year-old boy with a plastic sword - they need to assess the risk that they could pose.' The toys were taken from Ms Hardy's hand luggage after security scanners picked up a potted candle inside her bags and they were searched. She said: 'He was really upset as they're his favourite toys. He could see that his toys had been taken out of his suitcase and was asking where they were going. 'He was especially upset when we were told they were going in the bin. 'It's so silly. They're plastic toys and he's a five-year-old boy. 'If he had started waving them about on the plane - which he wouldn't because they would be in the suitcase - nobody is going to be frightened about that. 'A bit of common sense wouldn't go amiss. I'm all for security but you've got to assess what the risk is. I can't imagine how this is a risk to security.' Ms Hardy said that the airport should consider setting up a facility where people could leave such items to collect on their return or that they should donate items such as toys to charity. Not allowed: Security staff at the airport deemed Alfie's Leonardo sword was a breach of flight regulations . Taken: Alfie's Donatello sword was also confiscated by staff at Leeds Bradford Airport . Airport spokesman Andrew Shaw, said: 'We are directed through legislation that anything that looks like or replicates a firearm weapon must be confiscated. 'All passengers are given the option to take these items back to their car or post home. 'We confiscate a vast quantity of items and liquids in our daily operation and ultimately these items are disposed of by Leeds Bradford Airport.' Ms Hardy says that staff did not offer her the option of taking the toys back to the car and that she would have done this had she been told she could do that. The airport's website includes a list of items prohibited on flights. As well as toy or replica guns, restricted items also include razor blades, disposable lighters, scissors with a bladed length of six centimetres or over and safety pins.

Since Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, killed herself in April, her father, Glen Canning, has been a vocal advocate against cyberbullying and has demanded justice in the horrific case, in which two teens are facing porn-related charges. But he said he has now received a sinister message posted on his YouTube account demanding he 'shut up' or his life may be at risk. He has alerted police and they have launched an investigation. Scroll down for video . Death threats: Since Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, killed herself in April, her father, Glen Canning, pictured, has been a vocal advocate against cyberbullying and has demanded justice in her case. He has now received a death threat . '""I know where you live, I know your face, I know your car, I know your house, I know where you work. And you better shut up, bud, or you're going to be joining your daughter."" Just stuff like that,' Canning told CBC News of the threats. 'It's pretty sad, actually.' He added that he felt threatened enough to call the Canadian police. 'I would say I don't trust them why would I they are capable of doing some pretty sick stuff so whether or not they decide to take a shot at me some day I don't know,' he said. Royal Canadian Mountain Police Sergeant Andy Kerr confirmed they had received a complaint from Canning but wouldn't comment further because the investigation is ongoing. Police can request YouTube provide them with the person's information such as the IP address of the computer from where the comment originated. In the meantime, Canning said he is taking precautions including setting up security cameras around his Novia Scotia home. 'Victim': Parsons, pictured, was labelled a 'slut' after she was allegedly gang raped by four teenagers in 2010 . Protection: The two teenage suspects, now 18, cannot be identified under Canadian law because they were 16 when the alleged crime took place . 'We have cameras set up around our home right now to keep track of things,' he said. 'But . I think that they're gutless cowards. They're the kind of people that . would show up in the middle of the night and spray paint your house.' The threats come just a week after the lawyer for one of the two 18-year-olds charged with circulating rape pictures of Parsons is also being persecuted by a 'cyber-lynch mob.' Parsons' tragic suicide brought international attention to her claims that she . was gang-raped when she was 15 and then relentlessly tormented by . classmates who called her a 'slut' and harassed her for sex. Much . of the bullying was a result of a photo the circulated at her school . that showed Parsons being assaulted by a teen boy while throwing up out a . window. The two . 18-year-olds are charged with child pornography. One is accused of . taking the picture, both are accused of circulating it. Because the . alleged crime took place when the men were 16, they are charged as . juveniles and their identities cannot be revealed. Left behind: Her father said she killed herself out of disappointment in her . school, her former friends and law enforcement officers who failed to . help her . They were both in court on August 15 with their parents for a brief appearance. The judge set a trial for September 19. Josh Arnold, the attorney for one of the men, told CTV News that his client has already been convicted in the court of public opinion. 'The . Internet mavens and some members of the media have acted like a lynch . mob in relation to this matter. They've tried and convicted this person . without any due process whatsoever,' he said. Rehtaeh's . heartbroken parents say that she hanged herself in their bathroom two . years after the alleged attack because she could not bear to bullying . and torment at school. Her uncle was furious about the attorney's allegations. 'This . man's saying that these boys have been prosecuted in the media.That . hasn't been the case. That's not true,' Michael Parsons said. 'This . case has been brought forward in the media. Because, it was only . through the media participation that this case is even being looked at . today.' He also said he is praying for the two accused. Protesters: A handful of protestors turned out to the courthouse where the suspects in the Rehtaeh case were due to appear on August 15 . 'I have to pray for these boys. I . have to pray for them to become good men. That's the hardest thing for . me to do. But it's something I have to do. That's what's hard. If you . want to know the truth that's the hardest thing to do,' he told the CBC. 'I . have absolutely no faith in the RCMP or the Halifax city police or the . Crown prosecutors because they totally dropped this case, they totally . dropped the ball.' Rehtaeh's . death led to an outcry because no one was charged or even reprimanded . at the school - either for her rape or for the bullying. Four boys, aged 14, 17 and two aged . 16, allegedly took it in turns to sexually assault her on November 12, 2011, after plying her with . alcohol, she told her mother days after. Her . mother said she saw an image of the alleged attack which showed her . daughter being raped by a teenage boy as he gave a 'thumbs up' sign while she vomited out of a window. Police initially concluded there were no grounds to charge anyone after a year-long investigation. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Corporal Scott MacRae said they arrested two . males. Tragedy: Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, took her life in April after enduring months of bullying after an alleged gang rape . Innocence: Rehtaeh is pictured as a baby with her parents, Leah Parsons and Glen Canning . 'Due to the sensitive nature around this investigation, the . investigators do want to ensure that no court process is affected,' MacRae said. The arrests came after someone came . forward in April and provided new information and said they were willing . to verify who the suspects are.

"By . Abigail Butcher . PUBLISHED: . 16:06 EST, 22 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:06 EST, 22 July 2013 . A few months ago I needed emergency pain relief following surgery to repair my knee after I'd snapped several ligaments. It was snowing and as I was staying with friends and was still on crutches, I had to ring the out-of-hours GP to get a prescription sent to the local chemist for my prescription painkiller. But the GP refused to do this, and gruffly insisted I go in to see him. When I finally shuffled into his surgery, the GP winced with embarrassment and wrote out a prescription immediately. Worry compounded: Co-codamol, a compound painkiller, is highly addictive to women . But I shouldn't have been angry that he refused to prescribe my painkiller -  co-codamol - over the phone: as a  37-year-old female, I am the type of patient commonly addicted to this drug. Over the past ten years, the number of prescriptions dispensed for co-codamol has almost doubled - from 8.8 million in 2001 to 15 million in 2011 - and some experts are calling for more care when treating patients for long-term pain. Co-codamol is a compound painkiller, containing two ingredients - paracetemol and the stronger, more powerful codeine, an opiate that belongs to the same family of drugs as morphine and heroin. While codeine is an effective pain reliever, like other opioids it creates a feeling of calm and well-being. And like the other, stronger opiod drugs, it can be addictive. 'Patients and doctors perceive  co-codamol as being the safest of all opiods, but in reality it doesn't mean that it is safe,' says Glasgow-based GP Des Spence. Studies consistently show that more women than men are addicted to opioids. They are also the ones more likely to seek help for it - the Over-Count Drugs Information Agency, a charity which deals with addiction to over-the-counter and prescription drugs, reports that  65 per cent of inquiries to their  helpline are from women. Type 'co-codamol addiction' into an internet search and you'll find websites littered with women discussing this problem. Christine, writing on the forum Netmums, says: 'It has recently become apparent to me that I am well and truly hooked on co-codamol, which I take for back pain. Hooked: Signs of addiction include growing tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and using the drug in larger amounts for longer periods than intended . 'I don't know how to even begin to come off them because every time I go over three hours without any my body aches, I feel sick, get moody and agitated. 'Can anyone offer me some  advice? I am scared to go to the doctor in case they stop them all together.' Another Netmums member, Nikki, replies: 'I am in the same situation, I have been taking co-codamol for about five  years, pretty much every day  for migraines. 'At first I would only take them when needed, then somehow I found myself taking them every four to five hours, even when I didn't really have a headache - it was the relaxed warm feeling that they give me I needed a constant supply of.' Co-codamol is available over the counter in low-dose packs (8mg codeine/500mg paracetamol) with large warnings not to take the drug for more than three days. These warnings followed a  2009 Parliamentary report which highlighted the problem of addiction to low-strength co-codamol sold over the counter, and called for more awareness, control and education. Yet the problem is not over-the-counter co-codamol, but prescription versions. These  are much stronger (30mg codeine/500mg paracetamol) and dispensed in much  larger packs with no overt addiction warnings. There are also few guidelines on how long the drug should be prescribed - the British Pain Society advises that 'during long-term opioid treatment, reviews should be conducted at least monthly in the first six months after stable dosing has been achieved. 'Frequency of review there-after can be clinically determined by the complexity of the case, but should be at least biannually.' Dr Spence has become so concerned that he recently wrote in the British Medical Journal calling for 'urgent research, action and honesty' so the true scale of the problem can be identified. 'Prescriptions of co-codamol have almost doubled in a  decade and that doesn't reflect an increase in pain, but a lack of supervision of prescriptions,' he says, explaining that GPs are given no specific guidelines on how often to review prescriptions given to patients on repeat. 'At first I would only take them when . needed, then somehow I found myself taking them every four to five . hours, even when I didn't really have a headache - it was the relaxed . warm feeling that they give me I needed a constant supply of.' 'A few years ago, our practice noticed a large number of painkillers on repeat were being over-ordered, patients were having three times the amount they needed because the system wasn't picking up on the orders. So we took all painkillers off repeat so patients had to be reviewed by a doctor when they wanted more.' Signs of addiction include growing  tolerance (needing more to  have the same effect), withdrawal symptoms (feeling ill if the drug is not used regularly), and using the drug in larger amounts or for longer periods than intended, says Richard Velleman, emeritus professor of mental health research at Bath  University and a leading authority on substance misuse. One mother, 36-year-old Jo Gifford, from Cambridge, found herself addicted to co-codamol prescribed for endometriosis - an often painful condition where cells that usually line the womb are found elsewhere in the body. 'I've been using opiates for more than ten years. Codeine is the only thing that reduces my pain,' she says. 'About five years ago I realised it wasn't even touching my pain - I was taking more than I needed as the “hit”, that warm, fuzzy feeling of pain relief, became less and less effective.' Jo had cravings and would search the house for pills, asking friends and relatives for their drugs left over from dental work or other prescriptions. The problem: It's not over-the-counter co-codamol that is the issue, but the prescription versions . 'I really felt like an addict, so I went cold turkey and it was like a scene from Trainspotting - I was sweaty, awake for days, shivering, fluey. I was really  worried about taking it again, but it's the only thing that  will help.' Now, Jo limits herself to a minimal dose of co-codamol once a month - taking the low-strength over-the-counter tablets - to break the cycle  of dependency. As Professor Velleman explains, patients need to monitor themselves, as Jo does, to avoid the risk of becoming dependent. 'It's not an all-or-nothing situation, where some people aren't dependent and others are total addicts, it's a gradual process,' he says. If you're taking the pills for more than two or three weeks, he suggests trying to cut back. And if you can't, see your GP or local substance misuse service, or try to cut down yourself over a slow and controlled period of time - he advises against going 'cold turkey' when you completely stop the drug abruptly. Addiction to co-codamol is not something to be embarrassed about, adds Dr Spence. 'Doctors perhaps haven't made patients aware of the potential for addiction,' he says. He also believes doctors  need to acknowledge when there is a problem and help people come off it.But as someone who has experienced severe pain, knowing the risks of co-codamol has been a real problem. For having recently undergone reconstructive knee surgery, I was so concerned about over-using co-codamol as a result of my research that I didn't give myself adequate pain relief - and was consequently told off by my surgeon, who warned me that he needed me to limit my pain so I could walk around and shorten my healing time. Happily, I'm now well on my way to being back to normal.","Co-codamol is a painkiller containing paracetamol and codeine .

Flying marvel: Pilot Brian Trubshaw, clutching champagne after a historic Concorde test flight in 1960, amassed an archive over thirty years of flying the jet . A huge collection of artefacts amassed by the first man to fly supersonic Concorde across the Atlantic in less than three hours has been released for the first time today. British test pilot Brian Trubshaw created an archive charting his thirty year career, which includes a short note about its historic first flight over Britain. The handwritten log, from April 9, 1969, reads simply: 'Type (of plane): Concorde - Pilot: Self', and describes how he took off in Concorde 002 from Filton near Bristol and landed at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire. This blunt description was in sharp contrast with what he told reporters after landing, describing the flight as 'wizard - a cool, calm and collected operation.' Behind the scenes there were concerns over the safety of the craft, with pilots and crew having to wear air-ventilated suits and parachutes in case they had to jump out. His collection of documents, photographs and medals also contains all his log books covering his decades of service, which included six years of test flights before it was used as a passenger aircraft. The late airman's job was to put Concorde through its paces, criss-crossing the globe at twice the speed of sound before the plane entered commercial service in 1976. His work to get the Concorde project off the ground earnt him the CBE and a long-time friendship with Prince Philip. His family are now selling his extensive archive of material relating to the dropped-nose plane including his valuable log books that cover the momentous first flight. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Beautiful bird: Concorde 002's first flight in Britain in 1969, which Mr Trubshaw, who was in the cockpit, described as 'wizard' Magic moment: Trubshaw's log book showing the first ever Concorde flight over Britain on April 9, 1969 (underlined in red) Bigger picture: This page details the series of test flights that Mr Trubshaw carried out in 1969 alone, including the first UK Concorde flight above . World famous: The pilot was hugely popular and became friends with Prince Philip, pictured in the Concorde cockpit . Concorde was the world’s first supersonic passenger jet, capable of speeds of up to 1,350mph. The plane was a favourite with the super-rich because it could fly from London to New York in less than three-and-a-half hours. But the planes - built as part of an Anglo-French government treaty and first flown in 1969 – were long dogged by controversy and never really became profitable. The main problem arose from the sound of its sonic boom – the loud noise left its wake made when the aircraft broke through the sound barrier. By the early 1970s, Concorde had been banned from flying at high speed in most countries throughout the world. Only 20 aircraft were ever built - and these were sold at a cost subsidized by the French and UK governments to the formerly state-owned Air France and British Airways. Development of the planes was prohibitively expensive, so its only crash – outside Paris on July 25, 2000 – sounded the death knell. Though Concorde flew again, the cost of improvement in a post-9/11 world became too much to bear and its retirement flight was made on November 26, 2003. The collection includes Brian's medals, trophies, presentation plaques and bowls, his Concorde flight case and hat and a Concorde visitors book signed by VIPs. There are also scores of congratulatory letters sent to him as well as photos of Brian with Royalty including Princess Margaret and of him in the Concorde cockpit with Prince Philip. A rare signed photo of astronaut Neil Armstrong giving the thumbs up and stood next to Brian is also for sale. And a weather vane with a Concorde model on top that Brian attached to the roof of his house in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, for years makes up the £50,000 collection. The sale has come about because Brian's elderly widow Yvonne has just moved into a smaller home and no longer has the space for it. It is being auctioned by Dominic Winter auctioneers of Cirencester, Glocestershire. Mr Winter said: 'In the 1960s Brian Trubshaw was every schoolboy's hero. 'He was the chief test pilot for Vicker's Armstrong and worked on the development of aircraft like the Valiant V-bomber and the VC-10. 'He was selected to be the chief test pilot for Concorde. 'The development of supersonic transport started in the early 1950s so by the time it was ready to be tested in 1969 it was a huge event. 'There can't be another set of logbooks post-war, 20th century, that are more important than these.' Brian wanted to be a pilot from the age of 10 and joined the RAF towards the end of World War II, flying Lancaster bombers over Europe. He joined Vickers-Armstrong as an experimental pilot in 1950 and 19 years later made history by piloting Concorde 002.

Decorated hero: The pilot's long career earned him many medals, including (top left left to bottom right) a CBE (in case), a Royal Victorian Order, 1939-1945 Star, France and Germany Star, Defence Medal and the War Medal . Brian went on to test and show off Concorde around the world and in 1974 completed what is still the fastest civil trans-atlantic flight, travelling from Fairford to Maine in two hours and 56 minutes. Concorde entered commercial service in January 1976 when British Airways flew to Bahrain and Air France to Rio de Janeiro simultaneously. Brian ended his career as divisional director and general manager of the Filton works of British Aerospace in 1986. He died aged 77 in 2001. Mr Winter said: 'Brian's wife is downsizing and these items have been languishing in cupboards. She couldn't take it with her and thought it would be best to offer them to enthusiasts.' Royal seal of approval: Trubshaw's medals along with a signed declaration from Her Majesty the Queen . One of the documents in the sale is a telegram from Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace congratulating him on his OBE in 1964. It reads: 'Delighted to see your name in the Birthday Honours List - Philip.' Brian attempted to write a reply on the back and wrote: '... will you please thank his Royal Highness on my behalf and tell him how deeply appreciative and honoured I am of this kind thought.'

A woman who lost almost 20st after being told by her doctor that she could be dead within two years has dropped 12 dress sizes to be named Slimming World's Woman of the Year. Carole Wright, 54, weighed almost 30st and was virtually housebound, unable to perform simple tasks such as putting on her shoes or loading the washing machine. She left her house just four times between January and September 2009. In just over two years, Ms Wright, from Southport, Merseyside, has lost 19st 10lbs and 27 inches from her waist after attending her local Slimming World group. She said: 'The last time I weighed . 10st I was 10 years old. My life is completely different from two years . ago.

The award-winning slimmer, who has always been known as 'Big Carole', has . not only suffered from weight-related ailments, but has faced bullying . and criticism about her size since she was young. Ms . Wright said: 'I was called names as a child and as an adult. Strangers . in the street would make rude comments and the kids next door would . shout abuse when I was hanging out the washing. 'I tried to lose weight on my own but within days I'd be back to eating unhealthily.' Bullied: Nicknamed Big Carole, 30-stone Ms Wright suffered taunts about her size from a young age .

'I . relied on my asthma inhaler constantly and my son Jonathan, who's now . 15, had to help around the house. All I ever did was watch television or . sit at the computer.

Wine-makers in France are facing ruin after hail storms decimated vineyards in Bordeaux just a few weeks after summer storms destroyed up to 90 per cent of crops in Burgundy. The torrential hail storm which struck on August 2 ravaged around 20,000 hectares of land in the region - leaving many vineyards completely barren. Many wine-makers in the region have been left with no crops by freak hail the size of 'pigeon's eggs' while others have seen theirs severely reduced. Devastated: Many wine-makers are facing ruin after hailstorms destroyed much of the crops last weekend (stock image) Now two of France's best-known wine-producing regions, Bordeaux and Burgundy, will have limited output in the next two years causing many to lose their livelihoods and a hike in price for bottles of wine that are produced. Bordeaux winemaker oïc de Roquefeuil, who owns 30 hectares at the Château de Castelneau near the village of Saint Léon, between the Dordogne and Garonne rivers south-east of Bordeaux, told the Guardian: 'It's a catastrophe. Everything has gone: the leaves, the grapes, everything. It happened so quickly. A year's work gone in nine minutes of hail. 'The storm was so violent the hailstones wounded the wood. The outer skin is shredded. There won't be a single bottle from these vines this year. 'We have been hit by hail six times in the last 25 years, but never like this. We had just finished trimming the vines and getting rid of the weeds – without herbicides – ready for the harvest in September. They were perfect. We had high hopes of this harvest.' It comes after the majority of vineyards were wrecked by rain storms in Burgundy, where some of the country's best wines are produced, at the end of July. Damaged crop: The Burgundy village of Meursault, pictured, was one of many wine-growing villages affected in the Côte de Beaune region which stretches over 12 miles . Ruined: Vineyards which were left seriously damaged after a summer hailstorm in Burgundy . The damage caused by the ‘catastrophic’ weather is threatening both the 2013 and 2014 vintages of the exclusive wine. Growers are still assessing the impact of the storms on the vines, but the Burgundy Wine Board (BIVB) said the Pommard and Volnay areas - prized for their well-known and crus - were the worst hit. ‘It is awful to see these vines ripped by hail and several years of wine growers’ work destroyed by the weather in one afternoon,’ Xavier de Volontat, head of France’s independent wine makers said. ‘Damage will be severe, which means that the 2013 vintage due to come out in 2015-2016 will become much rarer,’ he said. Bad for business: Burgundy wine supplies will be hit for the coming vintage, meaning that the price will have to increase because of the scarcity . Premier cru: Burgundy is home to some of France's most expensive and respected wines, which are now in jeopardy . Many wine-makers were still trying to recover from damage caused by hail last year and from floods this spring. Some are using extreme methods to try and protect their crops from future weather-related catastrophe. One . technique being used is cannons which fire silver iodide into the . atmosphere which dissolves hailstones so they turn into rain. But a lot . of iodide is needed for it to be effective and advanced warning ahead of . a storm so it can be released in time. Another . option is placing netting high above the vines to catch the hailstones . before they can damage the plants but many wine-makers found the . hailstones just eventually broke the nets and landed on the vines . anyway. Many argue . that insurance is the only viable option - but with some areas seeing . six devastating hailstorms in the last 12 years, it is becoming . increasingly costly.","Severe hailstorms hit the Bordeaux region on August 2 completely destroying entire vineyards .

Chatshow host Graham Norton earned a staggering £2.61million from the BBC last year, it has been revealed today. Norton, 50, received the sum in fees and salary via his company for presenting BBC1’s The Graham Norton Show and hosting his Radio Two Saturday programme. The details have come to light after the BBC launched a cost-cutting campaign aimed at making savings of around three per cent which has included plans to cut fees paid to top entertainers. Flamboyant: Graham Norton has been a big hit with TV audiences and is clearly highly prized by his BBC bosses . Over the past year, the corporation has slashed the amount it spent on its top stars - those earning £1million or more - from £9.7million to £5.6million. But for a lucky few it seems, the BBC are still happy to shell out large sums to prevent them defecting to rival channels. Norton, who split from his partner Trevor Patterson, 30, in May, is one of 14 top BBC talents who were paid between £500,000 and £5million a year, however the BBC has declined to name them all. Financial information obtained from Companies House shows that the entertainer received £2.61million in ‘presenter fees, production fees and royalties’ from his production company So Television in the year ended July 2012. Happier times: Graham Norton with his partner of two years fashion consultant Trevor Patterson in January . He also made £10million from selling the company to ITV last August. So Television, itself also had a good year . increasing pre-tax profits 89 per cent year on year from . £1.22million to £2.31. At the same time revenues increased by . 14.5 per cent year on year to £13.59million with two-thirds of . this income coming from Britain. Earlier this week, Mr Patterson revealed that Irish-born Norton would often drink up to four bottles of wine a night - sometimes until he passed out. He claimed the entertainer would drink so much that he was sometimes found sleeping in his dogs’ bed at their home in Wapping, East London. Patterson, 30, said he shared 'everything' with flamboyant comedian Norton but frequently found himself playing second fiddle to their labradoodle called Bailey and terrier Madge. Norton’s incredible obsession with his pets, he said, meant that they were treated like the children he never had to the extent that he once chartered a private jet to fly his dogs to New York with him because he couldn’t bear to leave them behind. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC publishes talent pay in bands but does not comment on individuals' salaries. The BBC has saved almost £3m on the talent pay bill over the past year, and almost £30m since 2008. ‘ .","Norton received part of the sum for presenting BBC1’s The Graham Norton Show and hosting his Radio Two Saturday programme .

"By . Rob Waugh . UPDATED: . 05:08 EST, 8 February 2012 . Scientists have sequenced the genome of an extinct group of humans which spread around the world 100,000 years ago, using a small fragment of a human finger bone found in a cave in Siberia. The new, high-resolution genome scan will allow scientists to study how present-day humans evolved from our ancestors. It was sequenced from DNA extracted from a tiny sample - 10mg - of fossilised finger bone. The entrance to Denisova cave in Siberia: The scientists sequenced the genome from 10mg of fossilised bone . Along with the Neanderthals, the Denisovans are the closest extinct relatives of modern humans. ‘We hope that biologists will be able to use this genome to . discover genetic changes that were important for the development of modern . human culture and technology.These changes enabled modern humans to leave Africa and . rapidly spread around the world, starting around 100,000 years ago’ says Dr. Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute. The genome represents the first high-coverage, complete . genome sequence of one of our ancestors. Its creators describe it as 'a leap in the study of extinct . forms of humans.' The researchers had previously sequenced the genome at a lower resoulution using the fossil. The earlier genome allowed researchers to find, for instance, that present-day inhabitants of New Guinea have 4.8 per cent Denisovan DNA. This tooth, thought to have come from a five to seven-year-old child, was found in the same cave, and was the first evidence of the existence of Denisovans - now thought to be a crucial 'key' to tracing man's evolution . The new technique allowed the researchers to sequence every position in the Denisovan genome 30 times over, a far more detailed scan, according to a paper published in the journal PLoS One. ‘The genome is of very high quality’, says Dr. Matthias . Meyer. ‘We sequenced it so many times . that it has fewer errors than most genomes from present-day humans.' This level of resolution . was sufficient to establish the relationship of Denisovans to Neandertals and . present-day humans, but often made it impossible for researchers to study the . evolution of specific parts of the genome. The now-completed version of the . genome allows even the small differences between the copies of genes that this . individual inherited from its mother and father to be distinguished. The Leipzig group has now made the entire Denisovan genome sequence . available for the scientific community over the internet. The genome is also expected to reveal new aspects of the history of Denisovans . and Neandertals. 'We want to make it freely available to everybody already . now’ says Pääbo. ‘We believe that many scientists will find it useful in their . research’. The finger bone was discovered by Professor Anatoly . Derevianko and Professor Michail Shunkov from the Russian Academy of Sciences . in 2008 during their excavations at Denisova Cave. Human occupation at the site . is thought to have started up to 280,000 years ago. The finger bone was found in a layer which has . been dated to between 50,000 and 30,000 years ago.","Discovery could help understand evolution of modern humans .

"By . Eddie Wrenn . PUBLISHED: . 05:57 EST, 13 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:20 EST, 13 March 2012 . Brain scans of NASA astronauts who have spent more than a month in space have revealed damage to their eyeballs and brain tissue. The research may have long-term implications for long-term space journeys, hypothetically preventing us from spreading through-out the solar system and beyond. Researchers used MRI scans to examine the eyes and brains of 27 astronauts, and found examples of brain damage caused by exposure to the micro-gravity of space. This ranged from a flattening and bulging of the eyeball to damage to the connections between the brain and the pituitary gland - one of the key glands governing bodily functions. MRI scans spotted damage within the brains of astronauts, with the human body unprepared for coping with micro- or low-gravity . With humans adapted over millions of . years for living within the pressure of Earth's atmosphere and gravity, . it is unsurprising that space plays havoc with our systems. In . fact, with astronaut bodies trapped between conflicting gravity fields, . lower gravity, and centrifugal forces, probably the most surprising . fact is that our bodies can endure space at all. The MRI scans took place on astronauts who on average had been exposed to zero or micro . gravity for an average of 108 days, either on space shuttle missions or on-board the International Space Station. The problems are similar to those caused by intracranial hypertension, a rare and dangerous condition where pressure inside the brain rises and presses against the skull and eye sockets. The results, published in the journal Radiology, showed that: . While . these findings are not likely to put a hold on any current planned . space missions, there may be implications to long-term travel in space . as humanity continues to broaden our horizons. If humanity cannot survive years of . living and travelling in space, our ability to spread through-out the . solar system and beyond is at risk. However it is likely that technological solutions will be found as we push the final frontier. Study leader Larry A. Kramer, MD, professor of . diagnostic and interventional imaging at The University of Texas Medical . School at Houston, said: 'Microgravity-induced intracranial . hypertension represents a . hypothetical risk factor and a potential limitation to long-duration . space travel. 'Consider the possible impact on proposed manned missions to Mars or even the concept of space tourism. Can risks be eventually mitigated? Can abnormalities detected be completely reversed? 'The next step is confirming the findings, defining causation and working towards a solution based on solid evidence.' Backdropped against Earth, astronauts work on the exterior of the International Space Station during a 2009 space-walk . The types of abnormalities spotted are observed in cases of intra-cranial hypertension where no cause can be found for increased pressure around the brain. The pressure causes swelling of the juncture between the optic nerve and the eyeball which can result in visual impairment. Bone mineral loss and muscle atrophy are some of the other known effects of zero gravity on astronauts. William J. Tarver, MD, chief of flight medicine clinic at NASA/Johnson Space Center, said the agency has noted changes in vision in some ISS astronauts, but the origins were not yet fully understood. He said: 'NASA has placed this problem high on its list of human risks, has . initiated a comprehensive program to study its mechanisms and . implications, and will continue to closely monitor the situation.' He added the findings are suspicious but not conclusive of intracranial hypertension. No astronauts have been considered ineligible for space flight duties as a result of the findings.","MRI tests on travellers to International Space Station uncover effects on eyeballs and brain connections .

In an age where everyone is a digital photographer, one young artist has chosen to revert to a centuries-old technique to capture the 'soul' of his subjects. Matt Albert, from Denver, has two life passions - skateboarding and photography, and in particular, photographing skateboarders. Discouraged by the 'meaninglessness of most digital images' he has found a technique that he says reconnects him to the process of truly capturing a person's character in a picture. Using the traditional collodion process, Mr Alberts now plans to journey across the US in his newly converted motorhome-turned-dark-room, to capture the people he finds most fascinating - skateboarding 'lifers' - people from all walks of life who have devoted their lives to their love of the street sport. Scroll down for video . Lifers: Matt Alberts is travelling cross the US in his converted motorhome/dark room to photograph people who have devoted their lives to skateboarding - using an ancient collodion technique. Pictured, Walter Lacey, a lifelong skateboarder in Denver . Seeing into the soul: Mr Alberts says using collodion to photograph his skateboarding subjects allows him to see into their souls. Pictured, Kyleigh, from Boulder, Colorado, in a wet plate collodion image . He says his collodion black and white pictures 'see beneath the skin' of his subjects, because of collodion's 'sensitivity to see the UV light'. 'What better way to see these people in their rawest form and capture the real person inside,' he said. In a video posted on his own website, Mr Albert says he has been devoted to both skateboarding and photography since the age of 10. He bought his first skateboard at around the same time as picking up his first camera in a flea market. Ever since, he has been fascinated and devoted to both. Two passions: Mr Alberts says he bought his first skateboard the same time as his first camera in a flea market, aged 10 and been fascinated by both ever since. Pictured, Terrill Schmidt of Arvada, Colorado, a lifelong skateboarder . 'Dusty', from Riverdale, Utah, captured in 2004 using a wet plate collodion image, made by Quinn Jacobson. Wet plate collodion photography, invented in 1851, has experienced a resurge in recent years as photographers turn to this antiquated method for its moody, even haunting, images . 'One of the things about photography that I have always loved is looking at old prints and wondering the story behind the photo. 'Looking at a good portrait should feel like you are catching a glimpse of a person's soul and gives you an immediate insight into their life.' The best way of doing this, he says, is to revert back to using collodion to take pictures. 'In this digital world we get further and further away from the real meaning of photography.' Escaping from this disconnect, Mr Alberts has invested his 'heart, soul and life savings' into this dream. This circa 1856 collodion photo provided by Mr Alberts shows Lowell Gilmore at age 25 with his wife, Mary Eliza Gilmore, age 19, at a sitting in Albany, N.Y. He has bought and converted a motorhome to act as his transport, home, and dark room. And now he's hitting the road, to find and photograph skateboarding 'lifers'. 'To some, these poeple might be misconstrued as outcasts, but they are often some of the smartest people I have met,' he says. 'Lifers are a breed of people that eat, sleep and breath skateboarding just becasue they love it. Processing: Using the collodion technique takes time and effort, unlike digital photography. Mr Alberts, pictured, has returned to this process . to reconnect with the physical art of photography after being inspired by other local photographers' pictures . Lifetime investment: He has bought and converted a motorhome into a dark room and now Mr Alberts is driving across the US to find and photograph lifetime skateboarders using the centuries-old technique . 'Regardless of age, social status or . yearly salaries, lifers dedicate their lives to skateboarding and the . lifestyle it has to offer. 'From our neighborus with backyard . pools all the way to the legends that have skateboarding what it is . today, lifers are the backbone of the skateboarding community.' Now he is asking for help to support his dream to 'capture the essence of a true lifer'.

A Paralympic cyclist may represent her country in the Olympics after a bike crash miraculously gave her back the use of her legs. Monique van der Vorst, 27, was paralysed from the waist down and had been confined to a wheelchair for 13 years. Powering a bike with her hands, she had represented the Netherlands at the Paralympic Games and won two silver medals. Great recovery: She now competes on a standard bicycle and was this week given one of just 11 places on a top women's professional cycling team . But last year, after being knocked off her bike, her feet started to tingle, and within months, she was able to walk again. She now competes on a standard bicycle and was this week given one of just 11 places on a top women’s professional cycling team. Her dream is to ride in the 2016 Olympics. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Competing: Monique in Beijing on her way to winning silver during the 2008 Paralympic Games in China . Team spokesman Luuc Eisenga said: ‘It seems like a miracle.’ Miss van der Vorst was a sporty child who enjoyed tennis and hockey. At 13, she had just taken up cycling when a routine ankle operation resulted in nerve damage and left one leg paralysed from the hip down. Confined to a wheelchair, she took up hand-cycling and competed nationally and internationally, winning six European and three world championship titles. Miracle recovery: Monique van der Vorst running the XVII Rome Marathon Short Distance in March . In 2008, she was hit by a car, which damaged her spinal cord and left her completely paralysed from the waist down. Later that year, she won two silver medals at the Beijing Paralympic Games. Last year, while in her ‘best shape ever’ and training for the 2012 Paralympics in London, she was involved in another accident - this time with another cyclist. Her body went into spasm and she started to feel tingling on first one foot and then the other. By the end of the year, she was walking again. She told the Independent: ‘The sudden change of standing after being in a wheelchair is indescribable because suddenly the whole world has a different perspective. ‘It is really nice walking next to someone and being able to look straight into that person’s eyes.’ She has now swapped her hand-bike for a regular model and has started racing competitively. Earlier this week, she was signed by the Dutch Rabobank’s women’s cycling team, where she will train with some of the world’s best. Mr Eisenga said: ‘When we met Monique, we saw an athlete with incredible willpower and the right mentality for sport. ‘She has a really good level in cycling and we believe we can help her develop as a professional bike rider.’ Asked if she might make it to the Olympics, he said: ‘In sport, everything is possible.’ Team coach Jeroen Blijlevens said: ‘I am sure the other members of the team have a lot to learn from Monique.’","Monique van der Vorst was partially paralysed at 13 after ankle operation created nerve damage .

But coming home with a broken nose after a big night out seems to be a rising risk among women as well. A study of English hospitals found that the number of young women having their noses reset rose almost nine-fold in seven years. The rise of ladette culture, in which young women think nothing of engaging in the heavy drinking sessions and bad behaviour once the preserve of males, could be partly to blame. The rise of ladette culture, in which young women think nothing of engaging in the heavy drinking sessions and bad behaviour once the preserve of males, could be partly to blame for the rise in incidence of broken noses among females. Posed by model . The researchers looked at nose operations carried out at hospitals in Bath, Luton and Stevenage over seven years and analysed them by age and gender. Some 537 girls and women had their noses reset between 2002 and 2009 – meaning females accounted for about a quarter of such operations. The sharpest rise among all patient groups was in girls and women aged between 13 and 20. In 2002, there were just four operations in that age group, but by 2009 the figure had shot up to 33. As many people with broken noses do not have operations, the true number of breaks is likely to be even higher. Case notes at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital showed that some of the fractures were caused by domestic violence, sports injuries and traffic accidents. However, three-quarters were attributed to other types of accidents and non-domestic violence. Researcher Aaron Trinidade said this could include alcohol-fuelled fights, brawls and falls, as well as women and girls drunkenly walking into lampposts and  other objects. Researcher Aaron Trinidade said broken noses could be due to alcohol-fuelled fights, brawls and falls, as well as women and girls drunkenly walking into lampposts and other objects. Posed by models . Writing in the Journal of Laryngology and Otology, he said: ‘The cause may be multi-factorial but could be partially attributed to a rise in ladette culture.’ Dr Trinidade, who carried out the analysis while working at the ear, nose and throat department of Luton and Dunstable Hospital, said the rise of broken noses in the 13 to 20 age group was ‘particularly interesting’. ‘Other research has shown that there has been a rise in the amount of young people in this age group seeking specialist help for substance abuse, including alcohol, many aged 12 or less,’ he said. ‘In addition, alcohol-related anti-social behaviour has also been shown to be rising.’ The charity Drinkaware warns that alcohol can trigger ‘booze-fuelled barneys’ by altering mood and lowering inhibitions. Dr Trinidade, who now works at Ipswich Hospital, said that although he studied only three hospitals, it is likely the pattern is repeated around the country. ‘A broken nose is usually a relatively minor injury and is a relatively straightforward injury to manage,’ he said. ‘However, the question remains as to whether this trend belies a larger underlying problem – one of an increase in alcohol abuse and alcohol-induced violence, especially amongst young females.’",Study of English hospitals found number of young women having their noses reset rose almost nine-fold in seven years .

After his arrest, he attempted suicide in the bathroom at the Sheriff's Office's Operations Center using a shattered mirror and underwent treatment. He is being held in the Volusia County Branch Jail in Daytona Beach without bail.

Wants answers: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (pictured) has launched an investigation into Macy's and Barneys after customers complained they had been racially profiled by the retailers . The New York attorney general has launched an investigation into claims that retail giants Barneys and Macy's racially profiled customers in their 'stop-and-frisk' policies. Eric Schneiderman's office has sent letters to both stores yesterday demanding information on its practices for detaining and questioning suspects based on their race. It comes after four people have come forward with allegations against the two companies. In letters to Barneys CEO Mark Lee and Macy's Chief Stores Officer Peter Sachse, the head of the AG's civil rights bureau, Kristen Clarke, wrote: 'Attorney General Schneiderman is committed to ensuring that all New York residents are afforded equal protection under the law. 'The alleged repeated behavior of your employees raises troubling questions about your company’s commitment to that ideal.' The letters, which have been seen by the New York Daily News, gives them until Friday to supply the information. In her letter to Macy's, Clarke notes that the claims were even more serious because the company had previously been accused of similar tactics. The state attorney general's office filed a federal lawsuit against the company in 2005 claiming that it racially profiled black and Hispanic customers. Although the firm denied any wrongdoing at the time, it agreed to pay $600,000 in damages. It also created the role of security monitor, developed rules on handcuffing and kept a database of all detentions. 'Given this prior settlement agreement, these new allegations are particularly troublesome,' Clarke’s letter says. Shocking: Trayon Christian, 19, left, and Kayla Phillips, 21, claim they were interrogated by police after buying expensive items from Barneys . Yesterday, it was revealed that furious Facebook users had vented their anger over the recent profiling of shoppers in Barneys. It came after a fourth person came forward with similar claims, this time against Macy's - the second in a week. Art . Palmer says four plainclothes cops questioned him three blocks away . from the flagship store after he bought $320 worth of Polo dress shirts . and ties in April. The . latest accusation echoes those by Trayon Christian and Kayla Phillips . against Barneys and by actor Robert Brown against the same Macy’s. Palmer, a 56-year-old exercise trainer from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, said he made the purchase without incident, using both his Macy’s platinum card and his American Express card. He was walking to a gym on Park Avenue when police surrounded him and demanded to see his ID. Robert Brown with Sean Connery who he starred with in the movie, Finding Forrester. Brown is suing Macy's for racial profiling . Target: World famous male model Tyson Beckford said that he is . racially profiled when he goes into stores like Barney's and elsewhere . Brown, one of the stars of HBO show Treme, was released after being in cuffs for about 45 minutes without any charges . The officers said they were suspicious because they had lost sight of him on the store’s surveillance cameras, he said. When asked if he believed he was racially profiled, he told the New York Daily News that there was 'no other reason'. He was allowed to continue on his way after he showed his receipt for the duds and the cards with which he purchased them. When . Palmer returned to the store the next day to complain, a Macy’s manager . blamed it on the cops and said officers frequently come into the store . to monitor surveillance videos without permission, according to Palmer. Two . black Barneys customers said this week they were detained by police . after making expensive purchases, while last week actor Robert Brown . said he was paraded through Macy’s Herald Square store in handcuffs and . detained for an hour after being racially profiled and accused of using a . stolen credit card to buy his mother a $1,350 watch. Brown, one of the stars of HBO show Treme, was released after being in cuffs for about 45 minutes without any charges. He’s suing the store and the NYPD, charging cops racially profiled him and violated his constitutional rights. Fashion megastar Tyson Beckford, 42, told PIX11 on Thursday that he frequently gets judged on the color of his skin in Barney's and other places. 'I . might have the most recognizable face in the world. I still get . followed all the time, any time I go to a store,' Beckford said outside . Barney's. Trayon .

On Barneys' Facebook wall, users have posted their opinions, said the New York Daily News. 'Love these shoes ... but having dark skin, my hard earned money may not be enough to allow the purchase at this establishment,’ Facebook user Amelia Rios Alex wrote on the page, which features glitzy photos of shoes, perfume, jewelry and apparel. Anger: Furious Facebook users attacked Barneys' website over what they call 'modern racism', including the likes of rapper, Jay Z . Barneys' menswear ad was bombarded with angry comments . An ad for a John Varvatos suit with the tagline, Modern Monochrome, attracted 72 people to vent about the profiling scandal. ‘Modern racism,' said John Renaud. ‘Monochrome is right. Whites only’, according to David Nieves. ‘Will I get arrested if I buy this?’ asked Ramona Morgan. ‘Do handcuffs [come] with this or are they sold separately?’ said Facebook user Glenny Lennox. Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton has . threatened protests against Barneys and a possible . boycott for 'upscale racial profiling'. 'In major cities like New York, blacks . and Latinos not only worry about being “stopped-and-frisked” by police, . but they also fear the embarrassment of being “shopped-and-frisked” in . retail stores,' he said in an opinion piece for the New York Daily News. 'Perhaps . all retailers need a friendly reminder of the immense buying power of . blacks and minorities.

Sharpton wrote. Time for action:The Rev. Al Sharpton has condemned 'shop and frisk' at Manhattan stores and called for a boycott of Barneys . Sharpton said it was a 'travesty' that police and retailers interrogate black people who buy expensive items. 'Barneys, . a high-end retailer with stores in major cities, must answer for this . pattern of biased behavior, as must the NYPD,' he wrote. 'Our . National Action Network (NAN) Brooklyn chapter President Kirsten John . Foy said it best when he called Barneys’ behavior schizophrenic. On the . one hand, they want to expand their brand to the urban market, but then . they turn around and see us as suspects rather than prospects. 'Barneys . and other retailers that openly discriminate against us must be held . accountable. Simply apologizing isn’t enough; we need to see a plan of . action as to how they are going to rectify their ways.' Accountability: Sharpton said Barneys, a high-end retailer with stores in major cities, must answer for its 'pattern of biased behavior' Sharpton has demanded . a meeting with Barneys CEO, Mark Lee, and is 'currently mobilizing . activists for peaceful direct-action against the store and the NYPD.' Earlier this week, Lee said the company had retained a civil rights expert to help review its procedures and offered his 'sincere regret and deepest apologies'. 'Barneys . New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination and we stand . by our long history in support of all human rights,' Barneys said in a . statement. In his comment piece, Sharpton also highlighted the experiences of 'Treme' actor, Rob Brown, and Oscar-winning actor Forest Whitaker. Brown claimed he was paraded through .

Colombian guerillas have released a former U.S. army private who was kidnapped in June after he refused to heed local officials' warnings and wandered into rebel-held territory. Kevin Scott Sutay, who is in his late 20s, was quietly turned over to Norwegian and Colombian officials today along with the International Committee of the Red Cross in the same southeastern region where he had disappeared four months earlier. In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry almost immediately thanked Colombia's government for its 'tireless efforts' in securing the Afghanistan war veteran's release. Kerry also thanked the Reverend Jesse Jackson for advocating it. Scroll down for video . Freedom: The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), whose members are pictured, has released ex-U.S. marine Kevin Scott Sutay . The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, had said it was abandoning kidnapping as a condition for the launching of peace talks that began 11 months ago to end a half-century internal conflict. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos resisted FARC efforts to make what he deemed a 'media show' of Sutay's release and no images were released of the early morning jungle handover or of reported his late-morning arrival in Bogota, the capital. The rebels had announced in July their intention to free Sutay as a good-faith gesture but the liberation was delayed. Santos' firmness on prohibiting a ceremonial release of Sutay included objecting to the FARC-endorsed intercession of Jackson, who met with rebel leaders in Cuba in late September and said then that he would go to Colombia to lobby for on behalf of Sutay's release. Colombia's Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) lead negotiator Ivan Marquez (center) reads a document as members Jesus Santrich (left) and Andres Paris listen during a news conference in Havana . Sutay was delivered at 11.30am local time to U.S. government representatives at Bogota's airport, according to a statement issued by the Cuban and Norwegian embassies. The Red Cross said one of its doctors examined Sutay and he was good to travel and be reunited with his family. It was not immediately clear if he had flown on to the United States. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry thanked Colombia's government for its 'tireless efforts' in securing the Afghanistan war veteran's release . Sutay was the only foreigner known to be held by Colombian rebels. Attempts by The Associated Press to locate relatives of Sutay after his capture were unsuccessful. His service record lists his hometown as Willow Spring, North Carolina. Sutay was in Colombia as a tourist, the U.S. Embassy has said. The FARC said it captured him on June 20 in the municipality of El Retorno in the southeastern state of Guaviare. When it announced his capture, the FARC said it suspected him of being an agent of the U.S. government, whose close military assistance in training, logistics, surveillance and intelligence since 2000 has helped Colombia's government badly weaken the rebels. 'What would you think of a man who is in a war zone, who has a secret camera in his watch, who is carrying (global) positioning equipment ... who has a military uniform in his suitcase?' FARC negotiator Rodrigo Granda later. Local officials in Guaviare and international reporters who encountered Sutay there in mid-June said he appeared to be nothing but a tourist who spoke little Spanish and was determined to travel by land through thick jungle to Puerto Inirida on Colombia's eastern border with Venezuela. Pentagon records provided to The Associated Press said Sutay was a private, born in 1985, who served in the U.S. Army as a combat engineer from November 2009 to March 2013 and who was deployed in Afghanistan for a year ending in November 2011.","Colombian guerillas have released former U.S. marine Kevin Scott Sutay .

"Serious road accidents involving young . children are at a ten-year high . By . Ray Massey . PUBLISHED: . 18:02 EST, 17 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:12 EST, 20 June 2013 . A boom in smartphone use is being blamed for an alarming rise in the number of children killed and injured on Britain's roads, a report reveals today . A boom in smartphone use is being blamed for an alarming rise in the number of children killed and injured on Britain’s roads, a report reveals today. Children crossing the road are ‘distracted’ by texting friends, ‘tweeting’ messages, surfing the internet, playing games or visiting Facebook instead of paying attention to traffic. Alarming new statistics reveal that serious road accidents involving young children are at a ten-year high – particularly among girls. The report says the smartphone phenomenon is a factor. ‘There is a clear correlation between the use of technology and the time of serious accidents with children – particularly at the time of leaving school for the day,’ it concludes. Parents are giving the phones to their children at ever-younger ages – often for reasons of personal security but in some cases having been nagged into providing one to keep up with their peers, say experts. Nearly half of children aged ten have a smartphone, rising to three-quarters by age 12. Perhaps significantly, the age of 11 is both the highest risk age for child pedestrians and the average age at which children receive their first mobile phone. The report – by insurance company AXA and backed by the road safety partnership RoadSafe – is based on Department of Transport statistics and a poll of 1,000 eight to 18-year-olds who were questioned about mobile phone usage. It notes that a quarter of 11 and 12-year-olds – acknowledged as the ‘danger group for road casualties’ – and about a third of 14-year-olds ‘reported that they were distracted when crossing a road due to using personal mobile technology’. But the problem starts much earlier. ‘By the age of ten almost half  of children have received their first mobile phone,’ says the report. ‘By age 12, 73 per cent of children have a mobile phone. More significantly, they use their mobile phone functions much more than younger children do. ‘Because of this 25 per cent acknowledge that they themselves have been distracted by personal technology when crossing a road.’ At the same time about a third of pedestrians killed or seriously injured at the times of the school run were 11 and 12-year-olds. Alarming new statistics reveal that serious road accidents involving young children are at a ten-year high - particularly among girls . The pedestrian casualty rate for girls rises steeply from the age of 11, and both they and boys are three times as likely to be involved in an accident as a 10-year-old. This is an increase from ‘twice as likely’ just ten years ago. Overall, 2,400 children under the age of 16 were killed or seriously injured on Britain’s roads in 2011. But in five years there was a ‘proportionate rise’ in child deaths and casualties among pedestrians – from 61 per cent of all accidents in 2006 to 66 per cent in 2011. Alarmingly, the proportion of death and serious injury on the roads among children under five is at the highest level for 10 years – at 14 per cent – ‘and continues to rise’. Casualties for girls aged five to seven have risen by 45 per cent in the past five years – from  77 to 112.","Children busy playing games or on Facebook instead of looking at traffic .

Hannah Smith, 14, was found dead after being the target of anonymous trolls on the internet site Ask.FM . As they grow in popularity Twitter and other social media platforms are increasingly associated with cyber bullying, and in some extreme cases teen suicide. Cases such as Hannah Smith, the . 14-year-old from Lutterworth, Leicestershire, who hanged herself after . suffering abuse online on the site Ask.fm, have highlighted the dangers of social media. But demonstrating the more positive power of social media, in August a . Canadian teenager who tweeted about planning to commit suicide was . helped by concerned internet users from all over the world - potentially . saving her life. And now new research has shown that Twitter reflects trends in suicide surprisingly accurately and as such could be harnessed as a preventative force. Researchers at the Brigham Young University, Utah, found the number of ‘suicidal tweets’ in each area strongly correlated with the real suicide rate. They examined millions of tweets in America over a three month period and found the rate of worrying tweets in each state strongly correlated with that states actual suicide rate. The researchers found 37,717 troubling tweets, which mentioned suicide or key words associated with bullying which is known to be a risk factor, from 28,088 users over the three months. In the state of Alaska alone the team identified 61 at risk individuals form their tweets. Alaska also has the highest suicide rate in the USA. As Twitter generally provides at least state, or county information for each user, as well as enabling direct messaging to users, the researchers suggest that having this knowledge could be used to help prevent suicide in the future. An anguished tweet from a teenager in Calgary sparked action from fellow Twitter users, demonstrating the positive power of social media . Twitter users come together to prevent a Canadian teenager's suicide after she posted about killing herself . Christophe Giraud-Carrier, one of  the study’s authors says : ‘With social media, kids sometimes say things that they aren't saying out loud to an adult or friend in person. ‘Somebody ought to do something. How about using social media as a complement to what is already done for suicide prevention?’ Another of the study’s authors Michael Barnes says: ‘Tweets may be useful to address some of the functions that suicide hotline groups perform, but at the discretion and potential for such organizations to provide those services via Twitter.’ The team also hope to develop an app for more private forms of social media, which aims to single out worrying content such as statuses. The app would be used in conjunction with schools and students would have to give their permission for their information to be accessed. Algorithms would be used to analyze all content posted by students and alert the school to any potential issues before the student reached a crisis point.","New study shows talk of suicide on Twitter reflects real suicide rates .

Dentists are being urged to probe their patients’ personal lives to help curb rising rates of oral cancer. A leading charity wants to see dentists take a more active role in fighting the disease, which is claiming increasing numbers of lives in the UK. This could mean practitioners asking patients about lifestyle risk factors such as smoking, drinking and sexual behaviour. Getting personal: Dentists are being urged to probe their patients' personal lives to help curb rising rates of oral cancer by asking about asking patients about lifestyle risk factors such as sexual behaviour . 'We would like them to be more aware of the risk factors so that they ask the right questions,' said Hazel Nunn, head of health evidence and information at Cancer Research UK. 'Dentists should be asking their patients if they smoke or drink heavily. That doesn’t necessarily mean following up with a lecture, but they should be aware. 'If a dentist is looking at someone’s teeth and knows this person smokes 50 cigarettes a day and drinks well above the recommended amount, he might look that extra bit more carefully.' Oral cancer affects the lips, tongue, cheek lining, gums, palate and floor of the mouth. By 2030 it is predicted that 9,200 cases of the disease will be diagnosed each year in the UK, compared with 6,240 in 2009 and 3,030 in 1984. Death rates are also expected to rise by around 22 per cent over the next two decades. Right questions: Hazel Nunn from Cancer Research UK said dentists do not need to lecture patients but be aware of risk factors . The reason for the trend is unclear but thought to be linked to lifestyle. Smoking and drinking are two major risk factors for oral cancer, as is the human papilloma virus (HPV) which can infect the mouth as a result of oral sex. While fewer people are smoking than they used to, excess alcohol consumption and binge drinking is a growing problem, especially among the young. There is also evidence that people who have more sexual partners, and are more likely to engage in oral sex, are at greater risk of oral cancer.Most oral cancers produce a type of tumour called squamous cell carcinoma that spreads quickly. Early symptoms include sores, lumps or ulcers in the mouth which can easily be dismissed as harmless. Cancer Research UK, the British Society for Oral Medicine, and the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry are jointly lobbying the dental profession to take mouth cancer more seriously. They are pressing the British General Dental Council to make the early detection and prevention of oral cancer a compulsory part of dentists’ ongoing training. In May the council made oral cancer detection a recommended, but not compulsory, subject for continuing professional development alongside legal and ethical issues and handling of complaints. Ms Nunn said: 'We’re saying this is halfway there. It’s a commitment to doing more, but what we’re asking for is for oral cancer early diagnosis and prevention to be up there alongside cross infection control and the risk from X-ray radiation. 'All dentists will receive some initial training on oral cancer, but it’s not part of their ongoing training.' Oral cancer affects the lips, tongue, cheek lining, gums, palate and floor of the mouth and it is claiming increasing numbers of lives in the UK .","Dentists are being urged to probe their patients' personal lives to help curb rising rates of oral cancer .

So say Amsterdam's oldest 'window girls', Louise and Martine Fokkens - the identical twins who have worked the Dutch capital's infamous Red Light District for almost half a century. And at 70, the pair are celebrating being the city's most experienced prostitutes with a tell-all film that lays bare two lifetimes in the vice trade. Louise, however, was finally forced to hang up her fishnets two years ago after arthritis ravaged her joints making it increasingly difficult to 'do the sexual positions'. Martine is still going strong. Turning tricks: Amsterdam prostitutes Louise and Martine Fokkens are the subjects of a new documentary that sees then discuss their 50-year careers in the city's Red Light District . She relies on a flow of loyal regulars to keep her income steady. 'My regulars want to know they will get a good service,' she told The Guardian. Meet The Fokkens is a documentary by Gabrielle Provaas and Rob Shröder that charts the extraordinary lives of the sisters. They began their careers in prostitution in their early 20s and have worked the city's canal walks ever since. In the film they describe how times have changed . since they started their career in the early Sixties, and how they feel . about the public perception of their trade. It features a voiceover from Louise, who says: 'I can't tell you how many tricks we've had, countless. Candid: The sisters share their opinions on everything from vibrators to young prostitutes today . Double act: Louise and Martine dance in matching dresses outside their Amsterdam home . 'We hardly ever really f****d unless they paid us well.' Comparing the early days of the . prostitution world with the present day, she recalls: 'In the old days, . the local copper would tap on the window if a girl was showing too much . ankle, now the girls deal coke from their cubicles.' Louise . explains how arthritis forced her to retire two years ago, because she . 'couldn’t get one leg over the other' - though her sister continues to . work. The sisters tell in the film how they freed themselves from the control of their . pimps, ran their own brothel, and set up the first informal trade union . for prostitutes . But behind their jolly smiles and amusing anecdotes lies a lifetime of abuse, violence and exploitation. Louise was first to walk the streets after her violent husband sent her out to bring in extra money for him and their three children. Intimate insight: The pair describe how times have changed since they started their career in the early Sixties, and how they feel about the public perception of their trade . Tough: But behind their jolly smiles and amusing anecdotes lies a lifetime of abuse, violence and exploitation . 'I was beaten on to the streets by my husband in my early 20s,' she said. 'He told me unless I earned money for him he would . leave me, and I had children and loved him, so I had to do it.' She found work at a window brothel in the heart of Amsterdam's red light district. Martine, who had recently given birth to her fourth child, later came to work at the vice den as a cleaner . But when men began asking her for business, she joined her sister, realising they could make far more money 'doing threesomes'. One of their main bugbears is how Amsterdam's vice trade has changed over the years. They say the legalisation of brothels in 2000, rather than create a safe-haven for prostitutes to ply their trade without fear, it opened the flood gates to organised criminal gangs. It also vastly reduced their daily income, the sisters claim. 'There is no point working just for tax. That is why the girls are . working from the internet and from home – you are less likely to be . spotted by the taxman.' Both tell of the heartache of seeing most of their children bounce in and out of care as well as the shame she brought on her family when caught by her mother soliciting on the streets. 'I have €5 in my purse,' is Louise's answer when asked if she has any savings. 'Whores are expected to do things for nothing.' But despite their tumultuous and chaotic lives, the pair say they 'kept each other company' throughout, admitting they as inseparable now as they were 50 years ago and still 'do everything together'.","Louise and Martine Fokkens, both 70, began their careers in prostitution in their early 20s .

Millions of commuters were left stranded yesterday after the storm crippled large parts of the country’s transport network. Rail bosses were forced to cancel thousands of services because of trees covering tracks and damage to power cables. High winds also prompted officials to close the port of Dover in Kent and cancel ferry services running from other ports on the South Coast. Roadblock: A tree collapsed on to a bus in Wood Green, north London, shutting the street for the day . Trees on the line: This South West Train train was blocked near Windsor and Eton railway station in Berkshire . At Heathrow, more than 130 flights were cancelled and flights at other airports were delayed – affecting many families’ half-term holiday plans. Meanwhile, drivers found many of the country’s motorways were gridlocked due to heavy flooding and poor visibility. As well as this, plenty of smaller roads across the South became impassable due to fallen trees or chunks of masonry. Workers who tried to get into the office yesterday faced delays of several hours, others had to turn back when they discovered blocked roads and cancelled trains, while many simply gave up and decided to stay at home. Last night angry commuters said they had not been given enough warning about the cancellations. No trains: A deserted Victoria train station in London yesterday as many railway services were cancelled . Not moving: A fallen tree is pictured on top of a destroyed car in Camden, north London, following the storm . Forums and message boards were flooded . with comments, with some people complaining that rail companies had been . giving confusing and unreliable advice about the services they were . running. Were train companies too cautious in cancelling their morning services? Others accused bosses of overreacting by cancelling rail services in sunny parts of the country. Sasha White wrote on Twitter: ‘Sitting at the station in sunny Leicester and pretty much every train has been cancelled due to severe weather.’ George Thomson, who was stranded at Gatwick, wrote: ‘Opposite of the British Bulldog spirit. Flights on, buses on, but trains all cancelled on Southern Railways lines. Overcautious!’ And Stewart Jackson, MP for Peterborough, posted: ‘How come a gust of wind disables the whole east of England rail infrastructure?’ Hours before the storm began whipping across the coast, bosses made the decision to cancel a huge raft of services which had been scheduled to run the following morning. Walking it: A commuter loses control of her umbrella as she braves the wind and rain crossing London Bridge . No services: A fallen tree blocking the railway line at Beltring in Kent as Britain faced the worst storm in years . Yesterday Network Rail defended the decision, saying 200 fallen trees had been found on its lines. Robin . Gisby from Network Rail said: ‘While conditions were as forecast during . the early part of the morning, the damage caused has been more severe . than expected.’ Emma Knight, from South West Trains – which usually runs a train every minute into Waterloo Station during peak times – said that blanket cancellation was ‘not a decision that we ever take lightly’. She added: ‘If we hadn’t had weather as predicted we could have tried to reinstate trains. But if we had gone ahead with services, people would have been stuck, and we would have trains and crews stranded all over the place.’ Rail bosses also used the crash of a passenger train yesterday to justify their decision. The CrossCountry service, which had not picked up any passengers, hit a tree which had blown across the track by Ivybridge in Devon. The driver escaped unharmed. Yesterday David Cameron was asked if train companies had overreacted to the storm. He replied: ‘Everyone has to act on the basis of the evidence they are given. ‘Obviously afterwards we will be able to look back and see whether people made the right decisions. But right now what matters is listening to the evidence, working together and getting things back to normal.’ Meanwhile Nick Clegg found himself having to cancel a press conference, after a crane crashed into the roof of the Cabinet Office.

A huge swathe was cut through picturesque Gelt Woods in Cumbria,  flattening trees, churning up soil and  disturbing wildlife. Wasteland: Philip Day, whose £300million estimated fortune ranks him 277th in The Sunday Times Rich List, admitted two counts of damaging Gelt Woods, a 72-acre Site of Special Scientific Interest in Cumbria . Tycoon: Philip Day, 47, who lives at Edmond Castle in Cumbria, owns the Edinburgh Woollen Mill chain and is said to be as wealthy as the Queen, allowed trees to be felled on land where he has the shoot . Heritage: The court heard Gelt Woods is one of the county's finest conservation sites, featuring birch, oak, and alder trees, damp sandstone outcrops where mosses and liverworts thrive . Before the illegal felling, the area . was sheltered by birch and oak trees. Mosses and liverworts grew on . sandstone outcrops and birds such as pied flycatchers, redstarts and . wood warblers thrived. But by the time Mr Day’s workmen had . finished, the landscape – which provided stones for Hadrian’s Wall – was . a scarred scene of destruction. The 47-year-old, who owns the . Edinburgh Woollen Mill chain and is worth around £300million, told a . court he did not know the work was to be carried out and had not . authorised it. Hadrian's Wall, which stretches . across northern England, was built in 122 AD on the orders of the Roman . emperor Hadrian to mark his empire's northern frontier. It took eight years to build the 73 mile-long wall from the Solway Firth to Wallsend on the Tyne. It . is believed to have provided a barrier between Roman Britain and . Scotland and is thought to have been where the army could determine who . was allowed access to the empire. It . remained in use until the early fifth century when, with the empire . collapsing and the city of Rome itself under threat, the Romans left . British shores. It is the largest monument from the ancient era in . northern Europe and is a Unesco World Heritage Site. But because he had allowed it to . happen at the site of special scientific interest, he pleaded guilty to . two charges of letting unauthorised work be carried out. He was fined £450,000 and ordered to pay legal costs of £457,000 when he appeared at Carlisle Crown Court. Judge Peter Hughes QC said the . multi-millionaire had been ‘grossly negligent’ over the work, which . severely damaged protected flora in the ancient woodland. Judge Hughes also criticised the . businessman’s defence for ‘seeking to use the power of his wealth to . avoid responsibility’ and which had rebounded to his ‘lasting disgrace’. Day, whose fortune ranks him at 277th . in The Sunday Times Rich List, lives at Edmond Castle, a 19th  century . mansion near the Cumbrian market town of Brampton. The son of a newsagent, he is a self-made man who grew up on a Manchester council estate. He has previously been criticised for his handling of the 72-acre woods, which he bought in 2010. He angered townsfolk when he told a . parish council meeting that, while 6,500 young pheasants had been . released into the wood ready for shooting, 12,000 would be more . appropriate for an area of that size. He also said: ‘We don’t have to come up with replanting schemes if we don’t want to. We own the woods, we can please ourselves.’ Impressive residence: Hayton Hall, Day's home at Edmond Castle, a 19th century Tudor-style country pile near the small market town of Brampton, is just a mile away . Locals complained on internet forums about the woodlands being destroyed. One wrote: ‘I have seen these woods turned from their beautiful appearance, to what can be described as a farm. ‘Heavy machinery, no less than four diggers, three tractors and a host of 4x4s have been driven around the wood.’ The court was told that in November 2010, trees were felled and land was excavated to make a ‘significant’ track. In his defence, George Laurence QC, . said Day had neither known about nor authorised the work, and the . prosecution had accepted this. The court also heard Day had already . begun to repair the damage. Famous structure: The cliffs at Gelt Woods still bear the marks of Roman stonemasons who worked during the building of Hadrian's Wall (pictured) in around 122AD . The judge – who took court officials . and legal teams to the woods to examine the scene – said the fine had to . reflect legitimate public concern about the protection of conservation . areas. After the hearing, Janette Ward, of . Natural England, which brought the prosecution against Day, said: ‘Legal . action is always regrettable, and we were disappointed that a woodland . of such ecological importance, and one that is very special to the local . community, was so severely damaged.’ A spokesman for Day said after the hearing: 'As acknowledged by the judge in this case, Philip Day did not deliberately set out to damage a Site of Special Scientific Interest. 'Mr Day is passionate about the countryside and committed to conservation. He was shocked to find that damage had been caused to the site by contractors. 'As soon as he became aware of this, he worked closely with Natural England to carry out a full restoration programme, which was completed over two years ago. 'Mr Day intends to appeal against the sentence. The fine is nine times the amount imposed for previous similar offences.'","Philip Day, 47, lives in a castle and owns Edinburgh Woollen Mill chain .

A pair of ‘ghost brokers’ set up a fake call centre and duped buyers into purchasing worthless car insurance by using an iPod to play background office noise. Danyal Buckharee, 42, and Giovanni Recchia, 47, set up the elaborate scheme from a luxury riverside apartment in south London. The pair - who were jailed today at the Old Bailey - used sponsored adverts on Google offering premiums 15 per cent cheaper than average to lure their victims in. Danyal Buckharee (left), 42, and Giovanni Recchia (right), 47, set up an elaborate scheme, in which they duped buyers into buying worthless car insurance by using an iPod to play background office noise . More than 600 people were conned into paying up to £680,000 for worthless insurance. Buckharee, who masterminded the scam, was jailed for three years. Recchia, who was recruited by Buckharee to run one of the four sites involved, was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. Sentencing Buckharee, the judge, Recorder Joanna Greenberg QC said: ‘Young, inexperienced, hard-up new drivers were your primary target. ‘The people were driving around uninsured because of your activities. Your records show you have chosen fraud as a way of life. ‘I have little doubt that you will return to that life upon your release. The least sentence I can pass is three years.’ The judge told Recchia: ‘I have little doubt that you would never have become involved in anything of this sort had you not had the misfortune to meet Mr Buckharee in prison. ‘I take into account your profit from it was limited and you were under the direction of Mr Buckharee.’ Detectives . smashed the ‘fraud factory’ after the Motor Insurers Bureau received . complaints about three car insurance websites - Aston Midshires .

More than 600 people were conned into paying up to £680,000 for worthless insurance in under a year . Detectives investigated after the Motor Insurers Bureau received complaints about three car insurance websites - Aston Midshires Insurance, Astuto Insurance and Car Insurance Warehouse - in 2011. They then found a fourth website, First Car Direct Insurance . When officers from the City of London Police’s Fraud Enforcement Department raided Bukharee’s flat in Battersea, they discovered he had set up a fourth website, First Car Direct Insurance. The apartment had been equipped with office equipment, bank cards, chequebooks, mobile phones. Buckharee invented a whole host of staff to deal with customer enquiries and payments - including one named after the head of the City of London Police’s insurance fraud department. The illusion of a busy, legitimate company was maintained by playing a track called ‘Office Noise’ through an iPod connected to loudspeakers. Further investigation revealed around 600 drivers in total fell victim to the fraud involving all four websites. Car Insurance Warehouse and Astuto Insurance had earned £51,271.66 between May and August 2011. The First Car Direct website, one of a number which offered fake car insurance . The third website, Aston Midshires Insurance, made nearly £600,000 from more than 500 drivers between September 2011 and January 2012. In the three weeks that the First Car Direct website was up and running, thirty-eight customers had already paid a total of £40,773.12 for car insurance. Miss Mulligan said: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud and it was masterminded by Danyal Buckharee. ‘He used the four ghost broking websites to carry out car insurance fraud. He was responsible for setting up the websites, each of them purporting to offer genuine motor insurance at around a 15 per cent discount below the average price offered by genuine companies. ‘Unsuspecting members of the public were duped into buying this non-existent car insurance and paying money for it. ‘What he identified was he could target innocent members of the public, in particular young first time drivers for whom insurance premiums are extremely high, often inhibitively so.’ Recchia was recruited by Bukharee to run the First Car Direct fraud from the flat by answering phones and dealing with customer enquiries. He claimed that he was led to believe that it was a genuine business. A series of bank accounts were used to launder the money paid in by the victims. Buckharee, from Putney, south London, admitted two counts of fraud by false representation and three counts of money laundering earlier this year. He received three years in prison. Recchia, of Retford, Nottinghamshire, was convicted of one count of fraud by false representation and received 12 months imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 26, of Greenford, northwest London, denied money laundering and was earlier acquitted.","Danyal Buckharee, 42, and Giovanni Recchia, 47, set up elaborate scheme .

Seven out of ten women are unhappy with the look and size of their bust, a new survey reveals, with 75 per cent of women choosing to wear a cleavage-enhancing bra every day. Now George at Asda has released a new brassiere which, for the bargain price of £6, claims to give the same effect as a breast enhancement - increasing bra size by two cups.

Mrs Randall, from Ringwood, Hampshire, purchased the 500g bag from a branch of Tesco in Salisbury on Saturday. Mary Randall was about to start cooking when she found a swarm black weevil bugs inside her pasta bag . She is the second person in two weeks to find her 'Cook Italian' pasta bag from a Tesco store infested . She is the second person in as many weeks to have discovered a swarm of bugs in the Cook Italian pasta packets. The first infested bag was found by Hayley O’Shea, 39, who purchased a 500g bag from a Tesco store around 30 miles from Salisbury in Bournemouth, Dorset, on 12 October. She was cooking a tuna pasta bake for her two young children when she made the discovery. There are now concerns that other packets on the shelves of the supermarket giant could contain the creatures. Mrs Randall, who suffers from ME, has not yet complained to Tesco or returned the pasta because of her ill-health. She said: 'I’m not the first person this has happened to, but I want to make sure other people are aware this is happening because it’s really disgusting. 'The whole packet of pasta was alive with hundreds of horrible black bugs crawling around, some of the creatures are half an inch long, so they are very noticeable. 'I have no idea how they got inside, but it really makes my skin crawl. She added: 'I’m not impressed that they have managed to get through the packaging.' Mrs Randall purchased the 500g bag from a branch of Tesco in Salisbury on Saturday . Mrs O'Shea, an account manager at a marketing company, found the weevils in her bag two weeks ago . Mrs O'Shea, whose daughters are pictured here, purchased a 500g bag from a Tesco in Bournemouth, Dorset . Mrs O’Shea, an account manager at a marketing company, said: 'If there are eggs in the pasta hatching into live insects there could be more packets out there like this. 'There could be more people out there finding weevils in their pasta - I knew I couldn’t have been the only one. 'Tesco gave me my money back but that’s not what I wanted. I wanted them to look into it.' A weevil is a type of beetle which is usually less than six millimetres (0.24 in) long. There . are more than 60,000 species in several families and can often be . found  in dry foods including nuts and seeds, cereal and grain products, . such as pancake mix. In the domestic setting, they are most likely to be found when a bag of flour is opened. Their presence is often indicated by the granules of the infested item sticking together in strings, as if caught in a cobweb. Despite both women discovering their pasta bags to be infested with the insects, food manufacturer Cook Italian does not believe the whole batch is contaminated. 'There is not a contaminated batch of pasta, and weevils are not a big issue in the food industry,' a spokesman said. 'Most products that are dried like flour, rice and pasta, have tiny holes in the packets that we cannot see, otherwise moisture cannot escape and you would have soggy food. 'Weevils can come from any country and can even find their way into totally sealed food bags. 'They cannot survive the temperature at which our pasta dough is created, and we of course carry out frequent and extensive checks and control procedures.' They added: 'We are completely . confident that they have not originated at source, but have come into . contact with the pasta bag after it left the production unit.

Two Royal Navy helicopters came within 50ft of colliding on a night exercise because the pilots couldn’t see properly through their night vision goggles. A report which revealed the near-miss described it as 'a very serious incident that could potentially have ended with fatalities.' The near-tragedy happened three miles north . of Glastonbury, Somerset, at 11.10pm on June 4 this year. The two Lynx 8 helicopters were returning to a nearby base, Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, at 80 knots (92mph) just 200ft above the ground as part of a night flying exercise. A Lynx 8 helicopter similar to the two which came 50ft from crashing near RNAS Yeovilton, Somerset. Almost the entire fleet of Lynx helicopters at RNAS Yeovilton was grounded in 2000 after a safety scare (file photo) A diagram of the near-miss, which happened on a night exercise above Glastonbury, Somerset, on June 4 . Both crews were concentrating on climbing above power pylons which lay ahead of them in the darkness. But they were wearing NVG visors, which restricted their field of view more than other, more modern equipment. That prevented the four crew members from seeing flashing safety beacons which were fitted to each of the grey camouflaged aircraft. The two crews only spotted each other with seconds to spare, when one crew member grabbed the . controls and took violent evasive action, according to the near-miss report by the UK Airprox Board (UKAB). The helicopters were separated by just 20ft vertically and 50ft horizontally. 'Collision was avoided by a very late sighting by one of the aircrew and his quick reactions to take control,' said the report. 'There were no barriers left after this. Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, Somerset, where the two Lynx 8 helicopters were based . 'The overriding contributory factor . was deemed to be the complexity of low-level night vision goggle . operations and the associated restricted field of view.' 'Wider field of view night vision goggles would naturally contribute to improved aircrew peripheral vision. 'Whilst . this requires an equipment upgrade such systems are available today and . arguably would have enabled the crews, in this case, to have seen each . other at a much earlier stage.' Their ageing aircraft, from a family which has been in use for almost 40 . years, were also not fitted with widely-used collision warning systems . which would have sounded an alarm. The report added the incident would probably never have happened it the helicopters had traffic warning systems. The Lynx is part of the Fleet Air Arm which served in the Falklands, both Gulf Wars and is currently the scourge of drugs traffickers and pirates. It is due to be phased out and replaced with new Wildcats within a few years. The UKAB said that the safety margins were so far below normal it 'only just stopped short of actual collision', and designated it a category A incident - the highest risk short of an actual crash. The incident came amid an apparent spate of helicopter crashes this year. In August four oil workers were killed after the Super Puma helicopter carrying them to a rig near Shetland ditched into the North Sea. Workers were scared to take the daily round trip after the accident and the Super Puma fleet was grounded. A Civil Aviation Authority report later ruled a technical fault was not to blame. Workhorse: Lynx helicopters have been deployed in the Falklands and both Gulf wars, but are due to be replaced. The near-miss between two Mk 8 helicopters similar to these in June was named a 'Category A incident', the worst possible without a crash happening (file photo) Last month, an MH-60S Knighthawk helicopter used by the US Navy crashed into the Red Sea, sparking a frantic search for two missing crew members. And in January, experienced air ambulance and film stunt pilot Pete Barnes, 50, was killed when the helicopter he was flying crashed into a crane on the St George Wharf tower, which was still under construction in central London. The burning wreckage also killed pedestrian Matthew Wood, 39, from Sutton, Surrey, as he walked on the busy street below. The Lynx fleet itself was almost completely grounded in 2000 after a Lynx used by the Dutch Navy crashed. It took two years to get the fleet flying again after 44 of the helicopters had to have new titanium rotor heads installed.","Near-miss over Glastonbury, Somerset, was caused by old equipment .

But when this 50-metre high pylon crashed to the earth after being strapped with explosives it was certainly an eye-catching moment. The giant structure took just seconds to smash into the ground after it was obliterated with explosives in the Dwyryd estuary, North Wales. The pylon, which had begun to dangerously lean, was put under investigation and an exclusion zone erected . Boom! Plumes of dust and debris are scattered through the air as the explosives are detonated - making this a very noisy moment in the normally peaceful countryside . As the foundations slowly tear away from the ground, a cloud of smoke and dust can be seen rising as the metal structures buckle . Under the sheer weight of the tower, the strong frames crumple and the wire cables snap. The pylon plummeted to earth in the rural countryside in a matter of seconds . The tower began to lean when one of its foundations eroded. A 100-metre exclusion zone was put around the tower earlier this month, amid fears that overhead electricity cables could fall. Photographer Archie Harris was one of the few witnesses of the demolition on Sunday morning. Mr Harris, from Talsarnau, Gwynedd, which is close to where the demolition took place, said the problems were caused by the pylon being rooted in an unstable sand foundation. 'I'd never seen a pylon like that before. It stands in an estuary and when the tide comes its feet are in the water,' said the 67-year-old. Photographer Archie Harris was one of the few witnesses of the demolition and managed to snap a sequence of shots showing the pylon's collapse . The pylon and its foundations can been seen snapped in two, with only some strained cables connecting the destroyed 50m tower . A spokeswoman for National Grid said the pylon will be dismantled and another erected for the short term while a permanent solution is considered . 'I think the problem was that its feet were in the sand so it had very poor foundations.' Despite the dramatic images, Archie described how the huge metal design made hardly any noise as it hit the deck. The retired council worker said: 'Afterwards I went and told my neighbours who live close by and they hadn't even heard anything.' The images capture the initial impact of the explosives clearly and Archie's fast shutter speed allows us to see the pylon tumbling down. 'It was tricky because I was zoomed into the base initially to capture the first blast.' said Archie. 'I quickly zoomed out mid-detonation so you could see the whole structure as it went into the ground.' A spokeswoman for National Grid said the pylon will be dismantled and another erected for the short term. National Grid will look at a long-term solution for the area, she said.","The soaring tower in rural North Wales began to lean when one of its foundations eroded .

But for 22-year-old Stephanie Walker it became a horrifying reality of life. Miss Walker used to self-harm in her sleep and woke with injuries ranging from small grazes, to gashes which left pools of blood in her bedding. Stephanie Walker (pictured with her boyfriend Matt Daniels) developed a form of sleepwalking which saw her cut herself in her sleep - it was so bad that she would wake up to find her sheets soaked in blood . She struggled with an unusual and terrifying form of sleepwalking but has recently found relief thanks to a combination of medication and therapy. She was given sleeping tablets in an attempt to put her into such a deep sleep that she couldn't get up during the night. When this treatment failed, she was referred for a form of hypnotherapy known as sleep therapy. This treatment has now put an end to her night time injuries. Miss Walker said: 'I had one-on-one sessions with a sleep therapist and a counsellor. The therapist focused on examining my stress levels and revisiting the memories of self-harming while I was awake when I was younger. 'It scared me to think that my body was reacting in the way it did because I had no conscious outlet for the stress I was feeling. 'After the sessions with the therapist and the counsellor, I was much more relaxed. At first, I was still harming myself in my sleep, but the injuries became less bad. 'It stopped completely after me and my current boyfriend, Matt, became close again. We were very close friends when I was 16, but I lost contact with him between the ages of 19 and 21. 'It hurt to be apart from him. But since I've been in my current job, and in a stable relationship, I've never felt better.' Miss Walker (pictured in September 2011 while she was sleepwalking) said she was terrified because she did not know why she kept waking up with cuts on her legs . Miss Walker (pictured with her mother, Lynn) feared she would unintentionally hurt her parents or brother during one of her sleepwalking episodes . Until she received treatment, Miss Walker would use knives to cut her legs while she was asleep. She said: ‘At first I didn’t know what was going on. I knew no-one could have been coming into my room during the night. ‘The . injuries ranged from little spots and cuts to quite severe marks which . left a lot of blood on my bed sheets. The only rational explanation was . that I was doing it to myself. It was extremely scary.’ The frightening night episodes began when Miss Walker was 19, as she struggled emotionally following the breakdown of a relationship. She was terrified that her inexplicable night time activities would eventually lead her to hurt her mother, Lynn, 52, father, Peter, 54, or brother, Michael, 23. ‘I was able to piece together what was happening - I was getting out of bed and finding sharp objects, like knives, and then hurting myself,’ she said. ‘I must have wandered all around the house looking for cutting tools. But I had no idea I was doing it.’ Miss Walker was eventually referred for a form of hypnotherapy called sleep therapy, which finally put an end to her night time antics . She added: ‘I was always worried I was . going to hurt my parents. I wouldn’t dream of hurting them, but then I . didn’t have any control.’ Serious injuries occurred nearly . every week and soon Miss Walker was anxious that nothing could be done . to stop her bizarre behaviour. She . said: ‘It started happening with no warning at all. I had self-harmed . when I was a younger teenager, but I hadn’t done anything like it for . years. Miss Walker has now taken the step of covering the scars on her right leg with a colourful tattoo of Jack and Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas . ‘I sought help from my mum almost . straight away. I’d gone to her when I hurt myself when I was younger, so . I thought of seeking help from her first. ‘She was so supportive. She came to every single appointment with me, and every therapy session. ‘At first the doctors thought I was . doing it to myself while I was awake. They sent me to counselling and . analysed me, and put me on strong sleeping tablets which they thought . would knock me out to the extent that I wouldn’t be able to move when I . was asleep. ‘But they didn’t work. I became more and more stressed. ‘I kept nagging the doctors for help. They sent me for sleep therapy - a form of hypnotism - which began to make a difference. As the injuries became less severe, I breathed a big sigh of relief.’ Miss Walker, from Leeds, has not experienced any such injuries for a year. This week she moved into her own flat, confident her nocturnal self-harming has gone for good. Having completed her therapy treatment, she is being supported through her recovery by her boyfriend Matt Daniels, 23. Miss Walker said: ‘I feel freed from my behaviour, as if I’m able to move on with my life.’ She has even taken the step of covering the scars on her right leg with a colourful tattoo. She said: ‘You can’t see the scars on my legs any more. Most of them have been covered by a tattoo of Jack and Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas - it’s one of my favourite films.’","Stephanie Walker had a form of sleepwalking which saw her cut her legs .

Ten years ago the eyes of the world were on him as he kicked England to glory in the Rugby World Cup final. But when Jonny Wilkinson got married this week, the ceremony was a distinctly more private affair. England’s former fly-half invited only two witnesses to his secret nuptials with long-term girlfriend Shelley Jenkins, 33, in the South of France. Happy couple: Jonny Wilkinson, 34, and his wife Shelley Jenkins, 33, were married in a private ceremony . The couple met eight years ago while she was working as a cocktail waitress in the Majorcan resort of Magaluf. They were married on Monday at the town hall of the Riviera resort of Bandol near Toulon, where Wilkinson now plays his rugby. Neither of the two witnesses were thought to have been family members. Locals said it was an ‘intimate affair’. Christian Palix, the mayor of Bandol, who officiated, said: ‘I told him that the town was very honoured to marry him and I myself was very honoured to perform this marriage. I wish them great happiness in our town.’ He said he offered them an olive, which symbolises happiness. Mr Palix said that both Wilkinson and his new wife are well known in and around Toulon and are ‘both viewed with great respect’. Beaming: Wilkinson met Shelley, pictured here on holiday in Majorca, when she was a cocktail waitress in the Spanish resort of Magaluf . The couple met just after Wilkinson, 34, split from Sky Sports presenter Diana Stewart because he felt that ‘having a girlfriend distracted him from his rugby’. Not invited: Wilkinson's mother Phillippa, above, was not believed to be among the two present witnesses . It was just two years after Wilkinson became a national hero when he scored that last-minute drop goal against Australia in 2003 that made England world champions for the first time. Miss Jenkins caught Wilkinson’s eye while working as a waitress in a cocktail bar called Daiquiri Palace. The university graduate from Cleeve near Bristol, had spent many summers in Majorca’s party resort of Magaluf with her twin sister, Tracey. Wilkinson and Miss Jenkins were photographed on a beach together and she visited his family holiday home in Palma. The couple have been together ever since. She moved to France with him when he joined Toulon in May 2009 after 12 years with Newcastle. The couple have both done their best to learn French and enjoy the Gallic pace of life. When he first crossed the Channel, Wilkinson said he wanted to concentrate on getting his work-life balance right, explaining: ‘I was attracted by the beauty of so many new experiences – new team, new language, new region, living like that.’ Their turn: The couple were pictured together at the marriage ceremony of Zara Phillips Mike Tindall, at Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh, above . Early days: Shelley stepped out with the rugby star when he was nominated for a Sports Personality of the Year award in 2007, above . He said he made the move because he wanted to ‘embrace a new way of doing things’. Miss . Jenkins’s father Malcolm, who died in 2008, was the director of Sureway . Scaffolding in Bristol, while her mother Linda was the company’s . secretary. Wilkinson comes . from a sporting family. His father, Phil, was also a rugby player and . cricketer, his mother, Philippa, played squash at county level and his . brother, Mark, also played rugby for Newcastle. In action: Wilkinson decided to get married close to Toulon, where he now plays his rugby.

"By . Melissa Kite . PUBLISHED: . 19:13 EST, 29 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:59 EST, 29 October 2013 . As a handsome brown and white pony called Cappuccino trots smartly around the riding school, it’s impossible to tell he was once close to death. Three years ago, though, this shiny pony was one of 110 emaciated horses found starving on a farm in the south-west of England. He was so thin and hungry his body had digested all its muscle. His skeletal frame was, quite literally, just skin and bones. Although frightened by their approach, he bore strangers no grudge. He lapped up the kindness of volunteers at the rescue centre where he was taken, and responded well to months of physiotherapy and treatment for his damaged liver. Saved: Melissa Kite with Bombardier, aged 14, who when rescued was terribly thin and needed surgery because his terminally ill owner had not been able to care for him, but is now a picture of health . Today, as he trots around the school, he is happy to do everything that’s asked of him. All he asks in return is a little bit of loving care. As I watch him being put through his paces, I hope fervently that someone will offer this sweet chap a home. Cappuccino is one of 65 horses being cared for at the World Horse Welfare centre at Glenda Spooner Farm in Somerset. A few weeks ago, Princess Anne visited this inspiring place and adopted a horse. She took one lucky Welsh cob called Annie back to her Gloucestershire estate, Gatcombe Park, where the mare is now enjoying life as a hacking horse for the Princess Royal. Annie was certainly due a bit of luck. She was brought to the charity because her owners were not looking after her properly. Having run out of money to care for her, they rang the horse charity for help. Even then, it wasn’t all plain sailing. Twice, Annie was found new homes; but both times she was returned to the charity when her new owners’ changed circumstances meant they could no longer keep her. As the recession puts families under greater financial pressure, so more and more horses like Annie have been neglected or abandoned. Some 7,000 horses are at risk of serious neglect this winter, according to World Horse Welfare, which is appealing for the public to help. Rescue centres are full to bursting. Glenda Spooner Farm has already taken in 24 per cent more horses this . year than last — and they fear more may arrive as the weather gets . colder and people feel the pinch. Royal approval: A keen rider, Princess Anne is a trustee of the charity and even adopted a Welsh cob called Annie a couple of weeks ago and took her back to her Gloucestershire estate . Yet if they are to take in more rescue cases, they desperately need people to come forward to give ponies like Cappuccino a caring home. Cappuccino was one of six young ponies taken in by the centre after a member of the public reported an owner who had been breeding them on her farm. The situation had got completely out of hand and she had more ponies than she could possibly look after. Claire Phillips, manager of the rescue centre, explains that the reason for neglect is hardly ever straightforward malice. It is more often a case of financial hardship, or owners’ health problems leaving them unable adequately to care for their horses. The centre tries not to pass judgment, because behind every neglected horse there is usually an equally sad human story. Cappuccino was just two years old when he came to Glenda Spooner Farm and soon became a favourite with staff. ‘He was very, very scared,’ recalls Claire. ‘He had nothing holding his skeletal frame together — we had to rebuild him from scratch. But he was the most inquisitive of the group and quickly learned to trust. ‘Horses are so forgiving. They don’t realise that people have inflicted this on them, so as soon as someone is kind to them, they become quite trusting.’ Cappuccino had liver damage, because when horses are left to fend for themselves, they start foraging for anything to eat. If they are unlucky, they end up eating harmful plants like ragwort. Often people who abandon horses in a field think they can survive by eating grass. But in winter, the grass runs out and what does grow has little nutritional value, and then horses will eat anything in a desperate attempt to stay alive. As temperatures plummet, their bodies . burn more and more energy to keep warm. Without hay or other sustenance, . they soon digest all their fat reserves, then start to break down . muscle, too. Transformation: Jessica, left, was one of 26 bedraggled horses found in a field in March with painfully overgrown feet and full of worms and lice and, right, she is now happy, healthy and looking for a new home . When things reach this desperate stage, a horse may become too weak to stand and, as it lies prone in the field, insects and birds will prey on it. Too frail to move, hypothermia and dehydration will set in and its organs will fail. It is a horrifying way to die. But because the cost of putting a horse down humanely can be hundreds of pounds, people in financial difficulties do sometimes leave horses to perish like this. Then, it is up to rescue charities like the World Horse Welfare centre to pick up the pieces.Cappuccino is now nearly five years old and going well as a riding pony. In the right hands, he would be an ideal candidate for a child or teenager in a Pony Club, or simply as a pony to take on a hack through local woods and fields. Cappuccino’s handler takes off his saddle and gives him a post-exercise rub down as a noble-looking chestnut called Bombardier is led out from another stable. Only his slightly uncertain step gives a clue to his past. Bombardier was one of ten horses who fell into a terrible state because their owner was terminally ill. Too proud to ask for help until it was almost too late, the man eventually called the charity. Bombardier, aged 14, was terribly thin, had never been handled (trained or ridden) or had his hooves trimmed. He needed surgery to remove a growth from the side of his foot and treatment for a broken tooth which was sticking into his cheek. Now, however, he is a gleaming picture of health, and getting used to being led around. He still walks a little uncertainly because the wastage of his muscles has affected his balance. By next spring, staff hope that he will have completed his rehabilitation and be ready for a new home. But individual success stories like Bombardier aside, the charity is adamant nothing less than a major change in attitudes to horse ownership is needed. Just as any responsible person thinking of getting a dog would consider going to Battersea Dogs’ Home or a similar rescue charity before buying a puppy, so horse-lovers should consider taking a horse from a rescue centre before perusing the local ‘For Sale’ ads. For until more prospective horse-owners consider adopting an unwanted horse, rather than buying from a breeder or dealer, the problem of horse neglect will not get better. To understand just how bad the problem of over-breeding and abandonment has become, look no further than the case of Pickles. This friendly black and white horse . was one of a group of 40 horses who were found on a plot of land near . Cardiff Airport in January 2012. You may have heard of fly-tipping, but . did you know there is now something called fly-grazing? Horses . bred by irresponsible dealers who then find they are unable to sell . them are being dumped like so many unwanted tyres onto common land. Skin and bones: Many abandoned horse simply starve to death as temperatures plummet, their bodies burn more and more energy to keep warm and without hay or other sustenance, they soon digest all their fat reserves . Near to where I keep my horses in Surrey, I’ve seen live horses dumped on grassy roundabouts, and even on the verges of slip roads leading to the A3. When they were called out to Cardiff Airport, Glenda Spooner Farm only had the capacity to take two of the starving colts found there. One of them was Pickles. Happily, other charities picked up the rest. They believe they know who dumped the horses but cannot prove it. Successfully prosecuting for such behaviour is virtually impossible. The desperate plight of abandoned horses in Britain is a scandal. Some welfare experts believe local authorities will have to consider culls of abandoned horses if the crisis reaches the level it has in Ireland, where animal charities have now reluctantly called for such a move. For now, Cappuccino and Pickles need new homes — as do all the horses the charity takes in, if it is to go on helping other animals who are suffering this winter. Nearly all of those waiting for a home are rideable. None of them have been abandoned through any fault of their own. Take Jessica, a pretty, white, three-year-old with the most loving temperament you could wish for. She was one of 26 bedraggled horses found in a field in March — yet more victims of someone breeding horses for sale in a climate where there is very little demand for them. All the ponies had painfully overgrown feet and were full of worms and lice. Restored to health, Jessica is a delight. She sticks her nose over the door of her stable and plants a sloppy kiss on my face, before nibbling my hand gently. She is so sweet and affectionate I want to take her home right now, but I restrain myself. I have three of my own to care for. I pat Jessica and tell her to hang on in there. I hope she finds the home she so clearly deserves soon.","Some 7,000 horses are at risk of serious .

Miracle: Olivia Gilbert, 36, and her seven-year-old son Samuel, who almost crushed by a tree yesterday . As a huge, falling tree crashed down towards their car in the darkness of the storm, Olivia  Gilbert and her seven-year-old son Samuel seemed certain to be crushed. Incredibly, both walked away from the wreckage without a scratch. Yesterday, Mrs Gilbert, 36, described her overwhelming sense of relief that she and her child were still alive after the most devastating storm in more than a decade brought chaos to Britain. Mrs Gilbert, 36, and Samuel were trapped when their Citroen was crushed in the the hurricane-force winds that battered Britain yesterday. Samuel was sitting in the front alongside his mum when the tree . smashed down on the roof and crashed onto the back seat in Ipswich, . Suffolk. But they escaped unscathed as howling gales left a trail of destruction across the country and claimed the lives of at least five people. In this case were rescued by quick-thinking dock worker Dennis Green, 60, after the horrific accident at about 8.15pm. Mr Green said he did not even realise initially that there was a car underneath the massive tree as winds buffeted East Anglia. The incident occurred as Mrs Gilbert drove Samuel to his grandparents' home nearby. She had slowed down because another driver was turning around in the road. 'I was crawling at two to three miles an hour and that was when the tree fell on us,' she said. 'I just didn't see it coming. I just heard an enormous bang and it went all dark. 'I rang 999, but I couldn't hear them because the wind was so loud. 'It was then I realised the windows were smashed.' Escape: Olivia and Samuel were in the front of their Citroen C4 but thankfully the tree crushed the rear seats . Remarkable: At first the car was so swamped that passers-by failed to realise instantly that it was under this huge tree in Suffolk . Smash: A hero helped drag the mother and son from the wreckage of the car and the pair are lucky to be alive . She added: 'Samuel was so calm and brave. We are both so, so lucky to be alive. Victim: Bethany Freeman, 17, died being comforted by her mother after a tree crashed through her caravan and crushed her while she slept in her bed in Kent . 'I am just thankful Samuel was in the passenger seat beside me because if he was in the back I dread to think what the outcome would have been. 'The policewoman who was there afterwards said she couldn't understand how we both walked away.' Hero passer-by Mr Green said: 'I thought the car might catch fire so I smashed the passenger window. 'I tried the doors but I couldn't get them to open. 'I pulled the young boy out and passed him to other people - then I leaned in and dragged the mother out.' But modest Dennis insisted he was no hero after pulling off the dramatic rescue, adding: 'I think anyone would have done the same,' he said. But Mrs Gilbert declared: 'I'm very grateful to him - he was fantastic.' During yesterday morning, winds of up . to 100mph swept through the South West, South, South East, the Midlands . and the East of England after first hitting land in the early hours.

Three other people were injured in the explosion, one of whom remains in hospital. Mr Akhtar, an IT contractor who had worked for services company Atos, and Ms Kolasinska, understood to be a traffic light sequencer for Hackney Council, were found by specially trained sniffer dogs on the first floor of 47 Bath Road.

It was the symbol of love created by nature that inspired wildlife photographer Paul Mckenzie to propose to his girlfriend - thousands of flamingos flying a formation in the shape of a heart. The stunning image was captured as Paul and girlfriend Paveena were flying over Lake Logipi in Kenya in a light aircraft. Just days later Paul proposed - and he is now certain it acted as the inspiration for his life-changing decision. Nature's love symbol: An image of thousands of lesser flamingos flying over the lake bed in the shape of a heart in Kenya inspired wildlife snapper Paul Mckenzie, 48, to propose to girlfriend Paveena . Irishman Paul, who lives in Hong Kong, said: 'While standing in, walking through or flying over the shallow waters of these lakes, large concentrations of these Flamingos will often miraculously take on familiar shapes. 'Sometimes these shapes seem to be sending cryptic messages. While flying with my girlfriend beside me, a huge concentration of flying Flamingos below us magically took on the shape of a heart. 'It's hard to know whether this was a factor that led to my proposal of marriage a few days later which was accepted - but looking back, I think it probably was.' Thousands of flamingos walking through the shallow waters in the shape of a devil's tail at Lake Natron in Kenya - one of several amazing pictures taken by Paul . The formations throw up any number of interesting shapes, including in this snap where it looks like they have formed the outline of Africa . The formations can include up to 100,000 birds, which descend on the soda lakes due to the readily available microscopic algae which they feed on . The birds in a snake-like formation. Paul says the weird and wonderful shapes only last for a matter of seconds before the birds scatter and fly in another direction . The couple met in 2001 on a diving boat in the Galapagos Island and it wasn't long before they tied the knot. Ever since they have travelled the world taking more snaps of the beautiful birds. In one, several of the brightly coloured birds appear to take the shape of a mushroom, while another shows the rough outline of a shark like creature. A close-up of the birds in a V-formation. Paul has refined his technique to capture the shapes in time. 'I have learnt to be on the lookout for these shapes and have trained myself to shoot rapidly with my camera when they occur' Paul and Paveena have travelled the world photographing wildlife and most of their best images have been captured from the air . Paul said: 'It is not easy as the light aircraft I shoot from are buffeted by wind turbulence, while I'm always conscious that only a loosely fastened seat belt is all that is preventing me from falling out' Each one consists of up to a hundred thousand Lesser Flamingoes, who descend on the soda lakes due to the readily available microscopic algae which they feed on. Paul added: 'I have been privileged to spend many hours flying in a light aircraft, with doors removed on one side, over East Africa's soda lakes. Often, especially in the case of flying Flamingos, these patterns will take shape for only the briefest of periods. 'Over the years I have learnt to be on the lookout for these shapes and have trained myself to shoot rapidly with my camera when they occur. 'It is not easy as the light aircraft that I shoot from is constantly been buffeted by wind turbulence, while I'm always conscious that only a loosely fastened seat belt is all that is preventing me from plummeting several hundred feet to the ground.'

When Sam Burch and a few of her friends promoted their new Women’s Institute group on Facebook, they were stunned by the response. More than 350 women turned up to join at the church hall they had booked. They were totally unprepared for the growing interest in the ‘Jam and Jerusalem’ organisation, which leading members say has been sparked by the popularity of shows such as The Great British Bake Off and further helped by the ease of spreading the word on Facebook. However, there was room for just 220 inside the church hall in Bromley Heath, Bristol – so after having queued in the street for hours to enrol, many found themselves turned away. At one point organisers were so overwhelmed by the numbers they considered asking police to help. Disappointed: 100 women were turned away as the founders of the Bromley Heath group were forced to cap numbers at 220 new recruits. The women braved miserable weather to be in with a chance to join . Branch President Mrs Burch, 41, said: 'I was amazed by the numbers. I was slightly . worried it might happen and we might need to call the police or . something. 'When people . said there was queuing outside we ran to the door and let the first lot . of women in and then you couldn’t move - and they were still queuing . outside. 'I think the community is part of it, it is a very friendly community and we are trying to make it more so. 'We had spoken to friends who said . they were coming along and knew they would but there were so many more. We disappointed a few people, which we didn’t want to do. 'Many . women I know don’t do much for themselves, they do a lot for their . kids, families, houses and their work but this is something for them, . where they can learn to make cocktails and how to sort out the car or . make a curry.' Facebook effect: President Sam Burch believes advertising the group on Facebook led to the surge in interest from new members. The group are looking forward to a packed calendar of events . Stunned: Organisers of the new Bristol group of the WI feared they would have to call the police to manage the crowds, as 350 women rushed to sign up . The first seeds of an idea for the new group were sown in August when 14 women responded to Ms Burch's appeal on Facebook. She . said: 'There was another meeting in my living room - it was bring your . own chair and your own glass and then two-and-a-half months down the . line we launched. It was a little bit quick.' But . forget 'Jam and Jerusalem', the new troupe - made up of women aged 20 . to 60 - have a packed calender of events, including cocktail making and . car maintenance workshops. Senior members of the WI say . interest in the organisation has been boosted by . cooking shows, including The Great British Bake Off and Great British . Sewing Bee. National . chairman of the WI, Janice Langley said she has never heard of such . numbers signing up to a single branch ever before in its 98-year . history. Jam and Jerusalem: Members of the British Women's Institute making jam in 1941 - and it's still popular now . A woman gives a fruit bottling demonstration at a wartime Women's Institute meeting in Clapham in 1941 . The influx of . women at the new branch last Thursday comes after two further WI groups . started in Bristol in the last two weeks - adding to the 4,300 members . already signed up across the city. The iconic organisation was set up in 1915 to harness the spirit of the First World War and is best known for jam-making and its anthem Jerusalem. 'It’s fabulous,' National chairman, Janice Langley, said. 'I do think Facebook does make a lot of difference as it is a very quick and easy way of spreading the news and then people pass it on.' Chairwoman of the Avon Federation of Women’s Institutes, Donna Butcher, said when the local Clifton branch was launched several years ago more than 100 women turned up. She said: 'We have started three in the last fortnight, one in St George the week before and one in Redfield the night before, they saw large numbers but not as many as Bromley Heath. 'I think it is because women want to meet people in the neighbourhood, it is community and that is the theme at Bromley Heath, doing things together baking cakes, dress-making and I think television as well have played their part such as Bake Off and Sewing Bee and things like that.

A giant 'balloon of magma' is inflating under the volcanic Greek island of Santorini, a study has warned. The balloon is so big it has forced the island upwards by 14cm between January 2011 and April this year. It has also triggered a series of small earthquakes, the first seismic activity in 25 years - raising fears that the volcano could erupt for the first time since 1950. Volcanic crater on Nea Kameni, Santorini, Greece. The chamber of molten rock beneath Santorini's volcano expanded 10 to 20 million cubic metres . The chamber of molten rock beneath the volcano has expanded 10 to 20 million cubic metres - up to 15 times the size of London's Olympic Stadium since January 2011, according to a survey conducted by a team led by Oxford University scientists. The results come from an expedition, funded by the UK's Natural Environment Research Council, which used satellite radar images and Global Positioning System receivers (GPS) that can detect movements of the Earth's surface of just a few millimetres. The findings are helping scientists to understand more about the inner workings of the volcano which had its last major explosive eruption 3,600 years ago, one of history's largest ever volcanic eruptions, which buried the islands of Santorini under metres of pumice. Over the past year and a half, parts of Santorini have risen by 14 cm, such as the Kameni islands in the centre . The geological record of the island over the past million years reveals an extensive history of eruptions, with the most recent occurring in 1950. But despite being dormant for over half a century, satellites have detected the slight movements. Scientists say that the movements do not mean an eruption is about to happen. The rate of earthquake activity has dropped off in the past few months. Santorini is an island in the southern Aegean Sea, about 120 miles south east of the Greek mainland. It is the largest island of a small, circular archipelago which bears the same name and is the remnant of a volcanic caldera. Santorini, Greece, an island in the southern Aegean Sea, about 120 miles south east of the Greek mainland. It is the largest island of a small, circular archipelago which bears the same name . In January 2011, a series of small earthquakes began beneath the islands of Santorini. Most were so small they could only be detected with sensitive seismometers but it was the first sign of activity beneath the volcano to be detected for 25 years. Following the earthquakes Michelle Parks, an Oxford University DPhil student, spotted signs of movement of the Earth's surface on Santorini in satellite radar images. Oxford University undergraduate students then helped researchers complete a new survey of the island. Ms Parks, of Oxford University's Department of Earth Sciences and an author of the paper, said: 'During my field visits to Santorini in 2011, it became apparent that many of the locals were aware of a change in the behaviour of their volcano. 'The tour guides, who visit the volcano several times a day, would update me on changes in the amount of strong smelling gas being released from the summit, or changes in the colour of the water in some of the bays around the islands. 'On one particular day in April 2011, two guides told me they had felt an earthquake while they were on the volcano and that the motion of the ground had actually made them jump. Santorini, in the south Aegean, was formed by a volcanic explosion thought to have taken place in the second millennium BC . 'Locals working in restaurants on the main island of Thera became aware of the increase in earthquake activity due to the vibration and clinking of glasses in their bars.' Dr Juliet Biggs, of Bristol University, also an author of the paper, said: 'People were obviously aware that something was happening to the volcano, but it wasn't until we saw the changes in the GPS, and the uplift on the radar images that we really knew that molten rock was being injected at such a shallow level beneath the volcano. 'Many volcanologists study the rocks produced by old eruptions to understand what happened in the past, so it's exciting to use cutting-edge satellite technology to link that to what's going on in the volcanic plumbing system right now.' Professor David Pyle, of Oxford University's Department of Earth Sciences, another author of the paper, said: 'For me, the challenge of this project is to understand how the information on how the volcano is behaving right now can be squared with what we thought we knew about the volcano, based on the studies of both recent and ancient eruptions. 'There are very few volcanoes where we have such detailed information about their past history.' The team calculate that the amount of molten rock that has arrived beneath Santorini in the past year is the equivalent of about 10 to 20 years growth of the volcano. The findings were published in the journal Nature Geoscience.","Island is site of one of history's largest volcanic eruptions 3,600 years ago, which buried the islands of Santorini under metres of pumice .

David Cameron’s popularity is growing in Scotland but he should offer to devolve more power to win over voters, a Tory peer has said. Lord Ashcroft said many Scots said the Tory party was the best one to deal with the deficit and the economy, but they were often put off voting for it because they believed it is for ‘farmers and toffs’, that it does not care about Scotland and that their vote would be wasted. The party should offer to hand more powers to Edinburgh, including full fiscal responsibility, said Lord Ashcroft, who funded eight months of research, including a poll of 10,000 people. Popular north of the border: Prime Minister David Cameron should offer to hand more powers to Edinburgh, including full fiscal responsibility, according to Lord Ashcroft . His report, Cameron’s Caledonian Conundrum, highlighted the fact that the Conservatives had just one MP in Scotland, but added: ‘Despite the party’s shrinking vote share, there are  potential Tories at large in Scotland.’ Regarding the 2014 independence referendum, he said: ‘If the Scots vote to keep the Union, more powers for Edinburgh could be to the party’s political advantage. 'As long as voters think the Scottish Parliament exists to sign the cheques, while the fiscal prudence happens elsewhere, the Conservatives will seem redundant.’ Over the party’s relevance in Scottish elections, he said: ‘Many who would support the Conservatives if they lived in England instead vote to try to keep out whichever of Labour or the SNP they believe more disastrous.’ He also called for the Tories to stand up more for Scotland in Westminster. He said: ‘This will mean more campaign support and more  attention given to the effects in Scotland of national policy decisions.’ Lord Ashcroft identified 15 per cent of Scots as ‘Reluctant Cameroons’, who supported the PM’s policies but could not bring themselves to vote Tory. Just 8 per cent – the ‘Tory Core’ – would always vote Conservative, while 9 per cent fell into the ‘Willing to Listen’ group, who lean toward Labour but prefer Mr Cameron as PM. ‘Ed Miliband had made little positive impression on the participants,’ Lord Ashcroft found, although he was still the preferred PM because Scots are more likely to vote Labour. Meanwhile, ‘Nick Clegg was widely dismissed as being ineffectual within the Coalition’.","Conservative party 'should offer to hand more powers to Edinburgh, including full fiscal responsibility' says Lord Aschroft .

A man who claims he was sexually abused by Jimmy Savile’s chauffeur says he has been cheated of justice by David Smith’s suicide. The former driver for the BBC was found dead on the day he was due to stand trial for sex crimes uncovered as part of the Savile inquiry. The convicted paedophile had been charged with two counts of indecent assault, two of indecency and a fifth charge of rape involving a 12-year-old boy in 1984. Smith, chauffeur to Savile and other celebrities during the 1980s, denied the offences and was due to stand trial on Monday . Smith, chauffeur to Savile and other celebrities during the 1980s, denied the offences and was due to stand trial on Monday. But he failed to show up at court and a warrant was issued for his arrest. His body was found at his home in Lewisham, South London, following an apparent suicide. In a separate case to those charges, a 45-year-old man who had an abuse claim pending against Smith, spoke out yesterday to say the 67-year-old’s death has cheated him and other alleged victims. The man, who wants to remain anonymous, said: ‘I am bitterly disappointed that Smith will not now face trial after committing suicide.’ The victim’s solicitor Alan Collins, of law firm Pannone, said: ‘My client is angry and frustrated that Smith will not face his accusers. Victims often take a great deal of time to psychologically prepare themselves to come forward and confront their abusers. They have a desire to be vindicated.’ Smith was the first person to be charged under Operation Yewtree . He added that Smith’s death may have the effect of making his client and other alleged victims feel cheated of justice. Smith had a string of previous convictions for sexual offences against boys, dating back to 1966. The revelations will raise questions over why he was ever permitted to work for the BBC. Smith was the first person to be charged under Operation Yewtree, the investigation begun after claims were made against disgraced TV presenter Savile. He was due to be the first of those arrested under the operation, which was launched last October, to face a jury. In the case that Smith was due to stand trial for on Monday, it was claimed that he met his victim at a swimming pool and invited him back to his flat, where he sexually abused him. He also took the boy on a visit to the BBC studios at White City in West London. The boy claimed he was indecently assaulted during the journey. The alleged victim’s partner contacted police after seeing his response to the ITV documentary, Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile, aired on October 3 last year. At a court appearance in July, Smith pleaded not guilty to all offences and was due to stand trial at Southwark Crown Court. But he failed to show and initially it was thought he may have been held up due to transport delays as a result of the St Jude storm. When there was still no sign of him by 2pm, Judge Alistair McCreath issued a warrant for his arrest. Neighbours described how police used a battering ram to get into Smith’s top floor council flat before discovering his body. A woman said: ‘They got in through the door, smashed it right down, there was a terrible bang, like a wrecking ball. They were in there for a while. Then the ambulance came. They took his body out, it was all covered up.’ Another neighbour Jamie Cochran, 28, described Smith as a loner. He said: ‘He was quiet, kept himself to himself. He never seemed to want to chat. Now I know why – he was hiding something. He was a typical loner. ‘It is awful. He lives next to two primary schools. I thought if you were on the sex offenders’ register you couldn’t live right next to where kids go to school.’ Smith had been a full-time carer for his 95-year-old mother. It is understood that she was not at the flat at the time police made the discovery. She was told of her son’s death on Monday night. Another neighbour, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘His mum was very old, but she will still have enough about her to realise what has happened. What a terrible thing to happen to a person in the last years of their life.’ Judge McCreath yesterday ordered that the file on the case be closed. He heard from Detective Constable Michael Wallace, the officer who identified the body, that it was the same man as charged in the indictment.

Supermarket Sainsbury's is stepping up its fight against rival Tesco's Price Promise campaign in a long-running row over comparisons between the two firm's products. Britain's third biggest grocery chain is to take its battle into the courtroom by requesting a judicial review against a ruling by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that rejected its complaint over the Tesco pledge. The move comes after Sainsbury's lost an appeal against the ASA decision earlier this month, when a report by the watchdog's independent reviewer Sir Hayden Philips backed the ASA findings. Price war: Sainsbury's is requesting a judicial review against an ad watchdog's ruling on its price comparison row with Tesco . Sainsbury's believes Tesco's money-back pledge misleads consumers because it does not make fair comparisons . Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's commercial director, said it was 'time to take a stand' on behalf of customers to ensure shopping decisions are not just based on price, but also factors such as ethics and provenance. The Tesco money-back pledge compares the price of goods in a shopper's trolley at the checkout with prices at Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, with any difference on comparable products refunded in the form of a voucher worth up to £10. Sainsbury's believes it misleads consumers because it does not make fair comparisons, by for example, matching products such as its Everyday Value Tea, which is not Fairtrade, with Sainsbury's basics tea, which is. Sainsbury's claim certain comparisons are not valid as they fail to take into account whether goods are ethically-sourced . It added the pledge is also misleading on its basics water, which comes from a spring in Yorkshire, and is compared with Tesco's Everyday Value water, which Sainsbury's claims starts life at the mains supply. But the ASA said in July that Tesco's campaign adhered to its rules requiring advertisers to compare goods which met the same need or intended purposes. Sir Hayden agreed with the ASA, although he said Sainsbury's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. Mr Coupe said: 'Tesco says that whether, for example, a product is Fairtrade or MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) certified is just a ""minor part"" of a customer's considerations - especially for value products. We disagree. 'More than ever, customers want to let their values guide them and in price-matching its products with ours, Tesco is - when it sees fit - choosing to ignore factors such as ethical or provenance certification or even country of origin.' A Sainsbury's-commissioned survey of customers across all major supermarkets found 86 per cent of those giving an opinion agree that supermarket price comparisons should clearly state whether they take ethical production standards into consideration when matching cost. The poll also showed that 84 per cent of customers believe that how and where food is produced are important factors in their buying decisions. Sainsbury's will apply for an admission hearing that will rule if its judicial review will go ahead, with hopes for a court hearing next summer. The group's own Brand Match campaign recently fell foul of ASA rules, which saw the regulator ban an advert for suggesting consumers do not need to shop around to benefit fully from deals at rivals Tesco and Asda. Consumer group Which? also recently warned shoppers to take supermarket price match schemes with 'a pinch of salt' after an investigation by the watchdog claimed each retailer calculates the cost of a basket differently, making them of little real worth to shoppers.","Sainsbury's is escalating row with Tesco over price comparison .

Falling sick at sea can be an expensive nightmare for cruise passengers who may find themselves facing expensive medical bills, a new report warns today. Passengers who need to see a doctor on board their cruise ship complain of being hit by charges they feel are excessive, according to the investigation by Which? Travel. The report says that to many holidaymakers used to getting free NHS health care at home, the medical costs on board cruise ships come as a painful shock because they are all charged at private healthcare rates. Passengers on cruise ships feel they are being ripped off by cruise companies' on-board medical services . A survey by Which? found that one in five of the 1,368 members who had been on a cruise reported that they had visited the ship’s doctors. They faced an average bill of £233 -- but 12 of the claims were for £500 or more and one reported a charge of £6,500. Three in ten of those who saw a doctor had to foot the entire bill themselves as they could not claim any of the cost back on their insurance. one passenger who forgot to take enough blood pressure pills with her on a P&O cruise found that her forgetfulness cost her £154.. File picture . Nearly one in five said they could claim part of the cost back and had to pay the excess while four in ten said they could claim all the cost back but had to pay the excess. The majority of these charges were for one-off visits as six in ten people saw the doctor only once. Which? Travel says that one passenger who forgot to take enough blood pressure pills with her on a P&O cruise found that her forgetfulness cost her £154. Another passenger was presented with a bill for £2,500 after being admitted to the ship’s medical centre with pneumonia. Although her insurance policy covered £2,000 she had to make up the £500 difference. 'These are not isolated cases “ said Which? Travel. 'Our members reported huge variations in how much they had to pay on cruise lines.' Angela Smith, commercial manager for Healix Risk Rating, which advises insurers on medical risks says that these charges can come as a shock to holidaymakers used to receiving free health care in the UK. She told the magazine: 'If someone is required to pay £70 on board a ship to see a doctor, this won’t break the bank. 'However, a hefty medical claim that requires hospital treatment will. Very few people can afford £10,000 or £100,000 to pay these expenses. ' Which? Travel asked five of the biggest cruise lines in the UK market - Cunard, Fred Olsen, P&O, Princess and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line (RCCL) to tell them their medical charges, and they all said costs were in line with UK private medical care.","Cruise lovers who sought out ship's doctor had to pay £233 on average .

For generations it has been the family friendly board game used to while away a rainy afternoon. But it seems the latest generation of Monopoly players are simply too busy for the full version of the game. Instead its makers, Hasbro, have launched a new kids version of the classic which can be completed in less than half an hour so it can fit into its young players’ busy schedules. Monopoly Empire is on the list of top toy predictions for youngsters with an action packed schedule and short attention span . Manufacturers say the new Monopoly Empire game, which is aimed at children of eight and older, is meeting demand in the market from youngsters who simply don’t have the attention span to play for hours. Either that or they cant fit it in among their frantic schedules of ballet classes and football practice. In America, makers of the US version . of the game have become so concerned by busy pre-teens that they . have even eliminated the jail, so children don’t waste time waiting to . roll a double. And Hasbro aren’t the only ones making their games quicker to play. As . a whole the toy industry have made a move to offer what they call . ‘snack toys’ to appeal to children who have very little play time . because of their action packed days. Toy . manufacturers have been updating other games such as Scrabble and . Boggle with new speedier versions to keep the attention of their . increasingly distracted young customers. How it used to be: Mother and son spending quality time together playing Monopoly - back then children were encouraged to build a property empire on the classic board or even 'go to jail' Thanks to its new incarnation as Scrabble Flash, it is now possible to complete a round of the classic word game in just two and a half minutes. Siobhan Freegard, of Netmums, pictured at her home in Harrow. She says: 'The frantic pace of modern life makes it very hard to get the whole family together to play a board game' Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said the development of these shorter games showed how traditional board games had become a casualty of modern society but added that even playing a short game was better than watching endless hours of TV. She said: ‘The frantic pace of modern life makes it very hard to get the whole family together to play a board game. ‘With many families having both dad and mum out at work all day, evenings are more likely to be spent doing homework or household chores than leisurely playing board games. ‘So at first glance this seems a sad indictment of the breakneck speed we live our lives. However, as society isn’t going to change anytime soon, perhaps it is simple Monopoly being pragmatic. ‘If a short version encourages young kids to get into the game instead of watching TV or playing on the computer, then it would be welcomed by many parents.’ And it appears it is not just the children that have increasingly hectic schedules to keep up with. Last year a joined survey with Netmums and toy manufacturers Mattel questioned more than 1,200 parents and found that more than a quarter are now so busy they only play board games with their families twice a year. But it’s not just the length of play that has changed with the new edition of Monopoly, in a surrender to 21st century commercialism children are now encouraged to buy and sell brands rather than properties as they move around the board. Hasbro, the world’s largest board game maker, has sought the involvement of leading global brands such as Mc Donalds, X-Box and Coca Cola which occupy the spaces on the board ones marked out by the streets of London. Instead of building houses and hotels children collect tiles relating to each brand and use them to build up their own skyscraper in the centre of the board. The winner is the first to complete their skyscraper. Computer games, toys, ballet and sport are keeping children too busy to sit down with their families - the classic Monopoly board game is being updated to compete for the attention of pre-teens . But Mrs Freegard maintains that if these shorter games give children a taste for the joy of a good board game, it still may mean a resurrection of the full version as they get older. She added: ‘Lots of eight year olds also don’t have the concentration for the full version and mastering the short game will undoubtedly improve their skills and teach them patience. ‘And if they enjoy the short version, it will encourage them to try the longer version, preserving an interest in board games for the next generation.’","Youngsters simply don’t have the attention span to play for hours .

But the pair lost contact when Gutting went home to LA, and both went on to marry and raise families in different cities. Memories: Chuck Lewis and Sandy Cutting walking north on The Strand toward the Oceanside Pier where they met in 1945 . After a silence of 62 years, the pair got back in touch via email seven years ago and found the feelings they had for each other in 1945 were still there. Both now in their 80s, the memories of that long-ago summer are still vivid for both of them. Chuck Lewis, 85, told UT San Diego that when he saw pretty blond Sandy Gutting, he had to go and 'chat her up.' 'I was excited,' Gutting, 84, said. Young love: This photo was taken shortly after Lewis and Gutting met at Oceanside Pier . 'Here was this handsome guy who was interested in me, and I thought it would be fun.' The relationship turned serious and when Gutting, returned home to Los Angeles after spring break, Lewis managed to scrounge rides from friends to visit her every weekend that summer. But when summer was over, Lewis, still in high school, with no car, no money and having worn out his friends' generosity, couldn't visit his beloved Franci any more. 'We were involuntarily separated,' he told UT San Diego. 'It couldn’t be helped.' Sun-drenched summer: Gutting, pictured left in both photos, never expected to fall in love on her spring break in 1945 . For Gutting, it was her first break-up, and she took it hard. 'He broke my heart,' she said, explaining how Lewis sent a friend to collect his letterman's jacket from her. Gutting moved on, working as a flight attendant for United Airlines and marrying a man who was a passenger on one of her flights. She had four daughters, and when her husband died of a heart attack after 17 years of marriage, she raised them alone. Gutting eventually moved to Seattle to be close to her grown children and grandchildren. Lewis joined the Air Force, went to UCLA and became the manager of a lock-making company. He married twice, and his first marriage produced two daughters. Back together: Gutting and Lewis now spend every holiday together and a week out of every month . In 1990, Lewis retired to Oceanside, the town where he first laid eyes on Sandy Gutting. Years passed, but both Lewis and Gutting occasionally found themselves remembering the sun-drenched summer when they were young and in love. 'When one dates such a lovely girl,' Lewis told UT San Diego, 'one remembers such things.' Both treasured a small pile of photographs taken in 1945 when Franci, in a white bikini, and strapping 17-year-old Red would take beach trips and go on romantic dates. Gutting told UT San Diego how she would show a picture of Lewis that she kept in her closet to her grown-up daughters. 'There were many times over the years where I’d think about my dear darling Franci,' Lewis said. Despite the even greater distance between them since Gutting's move to Seattle, getting back in contact was a lot easier than it would have been in 1945. In 2007, a mutual friend told Lewis . that he had spoken to Gutting via email and discovered she would be . flying to Oceanside for a friend's birthday party. Lewis . needed no further encouragement and emailed Sandy immediately. The pair . struck up a correspondence, exchanging 62 years of news. He . picked Gutting up from the airport, wearing a red hat in honor of his . teenage moniker, and the pair went to their old stomping ground at . Oceanside Harbor for a long, conversation-filled dinner. 62 years in the making: Gutting and Lewis have now been together again for seven years . The chat that began again seven years ago never ended. Now, the pair speak on the phone at 9am and 9pm each day and spend a week out of every month visiting each other, in addition to whiling away afternoons playing each other at online scrabble. They don't plan to marry - Lewis still lives in Oceanside and Gutting remains in Seattle, close to her daughters - but the arrangement works for both of them. 'This works out for us quite well,' Lewis told UT San Diego. 'We are so different that if we were together all the time, I think we’d drive each other crazy. The couple spend holidays together, and their families have gotten to know each other and are ecstatic that Gutting and Lewis have found love again. 'We’re in love,' Lewis affirms. 'Sometimes I wonder about what would have happened if we’d stayed together back then. I think we both feel it could’ve ended in marriage. But it doesn’t do much good now to talk about ""what if?"" The future is out there, and we’ll face it together.'","Sandy Gutting, 84, and Chuck Lewis, 85, fell in love in 1945 on spring break .

Horror stories detailing how Londoners were fed ice-creams 'made in the gutter', lived above open cesspits and sold putrid foods containing 'cockroaches and cobwebs' were revealed for the first time today. These 5,000 documents, published online, show how the capital's medical officers fought to protect the public from filthy conditions, rancid produce and gradually improve their health. The Wellcome Library in London has also released a series of fascinating . photographs showing more than a century of efforts to educate millions . about how to live longer. 1963: This friends of Fulham Hospital carnival float was driven through the streets to champion the fight against lung cancer, and carried a boxing ring with variety star Nosmo King knocking out an actor playing Lung Cancer . 1974: Public health posters used to encourage people to give up smoking or to eradicate head lice among young children . These remarkable first-hand accounts spanning 150 years of London life are contained in . bound books compiled each year by the Medical Officers of Health. 1848 - Experts describe families living in slums on 'boarded over cesspools' 1860 - Widow found with husband's corpse in bedroom so she could kiss it each night . 1914 - Ice cream vendors selling wares to children in glasses they would lick clean . 1978 - Port of London inspector finds shop selling a 'ham, tomato and . cockroach roll' and a 'decomposed chicken sandwich'. They show how east London schoolchildren were given ultraviolet 'canned sunshine' to improve their health in winter from 1925 and how in a century the most popular takeaways went from oysters and eels to Chinese food. The searchable database of reports, called London's Pulse, runs from 1848 to 1973. Importantly they act as a form of census,  revealing how many were born and how people died, as well as where they lived and worked. In the first year of reports John Simon, the first medical officer described how slums in London were built on top of cesspits. 'In a very large number of cases... the basement story of the house . is tenanted, the cesspool lies – perhaps merely boarded over – close . beneath the feet of a family of human beings whom it surrounds . uninterruptedly, whether they wake or sleep, with its fetid pollution . and poison.' 1967: A dental health campaign used a clown to entertain and educate children at a school in Tower Hamlets . 1962: Two volunteers collect 'Meals on wheels' from their van in Stepney to deliver to the elderly and unwell . 1929: This photograph taken in Isleworth, west London, shows how babies were weighed as Britain struggled for food at the start of the Great Depression . The years of reports reveal not only the stranger side of life, but also the more sinister. One wife kept her dead husband at home because she wanted to kiss his rotting corpse each night. A report from 1860 reveals how a neighbour in a plush street just off Hanover Square had complained because his pregnant wife was feeling sick because of the stench. A Dr Aldis investigated and found 'a dead body here in so offensive a state that it caused a nuisance . throughout the house, from the widow frequently removing the lid to kiss . the deceased'. He decided that 'the body (was) to be covered in sawdust, . and the lid to be screwed down immediately, which was done, and the . burial took place soon afterwards'. Reports also reveal '22 instances where corpses were kept in inhabited rooms for prolonged . periods so as to be a nuisance'. Feeding a city the size of London is a difficult task, and the documents show how businesses were punished if they tried to sell food unfit for human consumption. One document reveals how on August 5, 1870, 'sixty-eight trunks of haddocks, in a putrid condition . were found in the possession of Mr William Reed, a wholesale fish . salesman in Columbia Market', in Bethnal Green. The medical officer wrote: 'I proceeded to the Market and when . about to seize the fish was prevented from so doing by some of the . employees abetted by the market inspector. 'The men at once . proceeded to load the fish in a van, which had been hired in the . neighbourhood and it was not without great difficulty, for the men were . very violent, we seized one trunk of the Haddock'. 1964: A huge team of food workers in this east London factory in Stepney break eggs for pasteurisation to reduce the risk of food poisoning . 1938: This invention was called the 'Open air public health propaganda Cinemotor', which was taken to this school in Bermondsey, south-east London, to show them public health films and photographs . 1971: This young boy has his eyes tested in Lewisham, south-east London, using a wooden spoon to obscure the eye and right in 1929, a little boy is weighed near Hounslow . In 1914 one health inspector described poor hygiene at ice cream stalls, a foodstuff prescribed by some doctors to improve the health of children. The report said: 'The ice-cream vendors are probably the filthiest . tradesmen in London. Their ice-cream is, or may be, . made in the gutter. 'The use of the small conical glasses . which are mouthed and sucked by children is most undesirable. For . cleaning they are dipped into dirty water which contains the mouth . secretions of previous buyers, swabbed with a small wet offensive duster . and upended on a soiled barrow top. 'One itinerant attempted to . improve upon this method by immersing his right thumb into this same . nauseous water and rubbing it vigorously on the inside of the glass: he . used no duster. 'Another was giving the final polish to his glasses by . rubbing them inside and outside with his handkerchief into which he blew . his nose. 'Still another cleaned out the form in which he made ice-cream . sandwiches by licking it with his tongue.' 1957: A rat catcher displays the number of rodents he has caught in and around the slums of Bermondsey . 1957: Another worker prepares deadly bait for the rats on what is described as a Bermondsey 'rat run' 1947: This image from Barking, east London, shows how schoolchildren were given 'Canned sunshine' from an ultraviolet lamp that 'glows vigour into young bodies in the Winter' Slum days: Many suffered ill-health due to starvation in Victorian Britain, such as these London children in 1860 . Decades later the problems were still very bad, with one report from 1978 detailing how they fined businesses for selling biscuits containing 'insect . excreta and webbing', a 'ham, tomato and . cockroach roll' and a decomposed chicken sandwich'. Simon Chaplin, Head of Wellcome Library said: 'The Medical Officers of Health reports provide a fascinating portrait of London life and the lives of Londoners.

President Barack Obama says that if he owned the Washington Redskins, he would 'think about changing' the team name, wading into the controversy over a football nickname that many people deem offensive to Native Americans. Obama, in an interview with The Associated Press, said team names like the Redskins offend 'a sizable group of people.' He said that while fans get attached to the nicknames, nostalgia may not be a good enough reason to keep them in place. Scroll down for video . Change it: In an interview with the Associated Press yesterday, President Obama said if he were the owner of the Washington Redskins football team, he would change the name so as not to offend Native Americans . 'I don't know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real legitimate concerns that people have about these things,' he said in the interview, which was conducted Friday. An avid sports fan, Obama said he doesn't think Washington football fans are purposely trying to offend American Indians. 'I don't want to detract from the wonderful Redskins fans that are here. They love their team and rightly so,' he said. But the president appeared to come down on the side of those who have sharply criticized the football team's name, noting that Indians 'feel pretty strongly' about mascots and team names that depict negative stereotypes about their heritage. Depictions: The Redskins players above are shown wearing helmets depicting the team's mascot - a Native American Indian .

An amateur cameraman captured the moment that police tasered an apparently suicidal man as he hung from the edge of a freeway overpass, sending him plummeting towards the ground. Footage of the incident shows the man falling about 15ft from the overpass near Fresno, California, into an air cushion set up to break his fall. But even though the officers seem to have saved the man from killing himself, observers who are out of shot are heard saying: 'There is no denying it. This is becoming a police state.' Suicide attempt? Police and firefighters surround a man hanging from a freeway overpass near Fresno . Ready to act: The red dots of the tasers' laser sights flash across the man's behind and lower back . Down he comes: The man drops his hands and begins to fall backwards as he is hit by the electrical current . A commenter on an AR15.com forum thread about the video says that the incident appears to have occurred over US99, only several blocks from the main part of Fresno. As the video begins, it shows a man standing on a small ledge in front of a highway sign attached to the side of an overpass 15ft above the ground. Firefighters at the scene have inflated a cushion to stop the man from falling to his death and provided a cherry picker for police officers to get in closer to where he clings to the side of the bridge. More police stand above him on the overpass, shining flashlights down to illuminate where he stands. As officers attempt to talk down the man, who is facing away from them, the tell-tale flash of laser sights begin to flicker across his lower back. Wedged in place? For a second after falling, the man appears to be stuck between the overpass and crane . Head first: But a police officer or firefighter quickly moves to dislodge him and he plummets to the ground . Help is at hand: Paramedics rush forward with a stretcher to take the man to hospital after he lands . Suddenly, 53 seconds into the clip, the man shrieks in agony and clutches his backside, before dropping backwards and apparently smacking his head on the edge of the Fire Department cherry picker - which stops him from falling. Although the footage is unclear, emergency services personnel then appear to lean over and push the man off the side of the bridge on to the inflatable, which police and firefighters have hurriedly pushed square beneath him. Paramedics then rush forward with a wheeled stretcher and the man is presumably taken to hospital, as observers yell at them: 'Let him go!' The response of those heard off camera to the events unfolding before them is indicative of the low esteem that police are held in by some in the Fresno area. Online commenters were less sympathetic to the tasered man's plight. Meathead12 wrote on the LiveLeak comments section: 'Typical f****** toads screaming about a ""police state"" and ""let him go"" at the end there. 'This clown shuts down an entire freeway and is 25' above the concrete for his own selfish reasons. They bring him down without injury. What would they [those heard out of shot] have proposed to do??' GhostFrog added: 'And if they left him alone to do his thing the whiners would be complaining that the police did nothing.' The film was uploaded to LiveLeak 15 hours ago, where it has already been watched more than 21,000 times, attracting nearly 400 comments at the time of writing.

Kadie Walsh and Dake Schmidt, both local fishing guides, opted for a rather nontraditional salmon fishing theme for their entire wedding. The couple's rings were presented each in the mouths of two king salmon and both the bridesmaids and groomsmen were carrying fishing rods complete with flower posies throughout the ceremony.

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 01:40 EST, 31 August 2011 . New details of unethical U.S. medical experiments in Guatemala in the 1940s have revealed that a dying woman was reinfected with syphilis. The experiments nearly 70 years ago are already considered one of the darkest periods in U.S. medical research history. Researchers who experimented on disabled American citizens and prison inmates in the name of medical advancement also infected a dying woman with syphilis in order to test whether penicillin could prevent infections. Infect and observe: The apparent experiments in Guatemala are similar to other forms of research during the same period where prison inmates were infected with malaria . New details released by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues revealed that soldiers, prostitutes, prisoners and mental patients were also among the 1,300 deliberately infected with the STD. The commission revealed on Monday that only about 700 of those infected received some sort of treatment. Of those infected, 83 people died, although it's not clear if the deaths were directly due to the experiments. Some experts have claimed that the research came up with no useful medical information. Anita Allen, a member of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, said: 'The researchers put their own medical advancement first and human decency a far second.' The experiments were hidden for decades but came to light last year after a Wellesley College medical historian discovered records among the papers of Dr. John Cutler, who led the experiments. Captive guinea pigs: In 1945, army doctors exposed inmates to malaria-carrying mosquitoes, while soldiers were later exposed to syphilis in Guatemala . After the experiments were revealed, President Barack Obama called Guatemala's president, Alvaro Colom, to apologise before ordering the bioethics commission to investigate. Though the final report is not due until next month, commission members discussed some of the findings at a meeting Monday in Washington. They revealed that some of the experiments were more shocking than was previously known. For example, seven women with epilepsy, who were housed at Guatemala's Asilo de Alienados (Home for the Insane), were injected with syphilis below the back of the skull, a risky procedure. The researchers thought the new infection might somehow help cure epilepsy. Barack Obama has called Guatemalan president Alvaro Colom, right, to apologise following the revelations of the terminally-ill being infected with syphilis . The women each got bacterial meningitis, probably as a result of the unsterile injections, but were treated. Perhaps the most disturbing details involved a female syphilis patient with an undisclosed terminal illness. The researchers, curious to see the impact of an additional infection, infected her with gonorrhea in her eyes and elsewhere. Six months later she died. Dr. Amy Gutmann, head of the commission, described the case as 'chillingly egregious.' During that time, other researchers were also using people as human guinea pigs, in some cases infecting them with illnesses. Panel members concluded that the Guatemala research was bad even by the standards of the time. They compared the work to a 1943 experiment by Cutler and others in which prison inmates were infected with gonorrhea in Indiana. The inmates were volunteers who were told what was involved in the study and gave their consent. The Guatemalan participants - or many of them - received no such explanations and did not give informed consent, the commission said. The commission is working on a second report examining federally funded international studies to make sure current research is being done ethically. That report is expected at the end of the year. Meanwhile, the Guatemalan government has vowed to do its own investigation into the Cutler study. A spokesman for Vice President Rafael Espada said the report should be done by November.","Soldiers and prostitutes also given STD during 1940s medical research .

He always loved being sung to and seemed more relaxed when music was being played. ‘We hope that when we tell Freddie about the musical element of his beginnings it will help him feel extra-special.’ Freddie’s mother became pregnant with him after travelling to Barcelona for treatment at the Institut Marques fertility clinic where researchers are studying whether playing music in IVF labs boosts the odds of fertilisation. They injected sperm into almost 1,000 eggs and put them in dishes in incubators. They then placed speakers in half the incubators and played music round the clock. The playlist included pop songs by Michael Jackson and Madonna, heavier tracks from Nirvana and Metallica and classical works by Bach, Mozart and Vivaldi. As expected, not all of the eggs were fertilised. But, . to their surprise, they found that fertilisation rates were around five . per cent higher in the incubators in which music had been played. Studies suggest that the tiny vibrations produced by music give fertilisation a helping hand . Pop, heavy metal and classical music appeared to work equally well. Embryos don’t develop the ability to detect sound for at least 14 weeks, so it is thought that the vibrations produced by the music are key. They are believed to ease the passage of nutrients into the egg and speed the removal of toxic waste, so increasing the odds of fertilisation taking place and the fledgling embryo surviving. In natural conception, the fertilised egg is rocked as it rolls down the fallopian tube.  It is also subjected to gentle contractions in the womb. It is too early to say if the musical . technique boosts the odds of giving birth but couples in 17 countries, . including the UK, have become parents thanks to it. Freddie’s loves nothing more than turning the knobs of a large radio that is put beside him when he plays on the floor. It is thought the vibrations created by music ease the passage of nutrients into the egg and speed the removal of toxic waste, so increasing the odds of fertilisation taking place . His parents, who spent four years trying for a family before travelling to Spain, said: ‘We were utterly overjoyed when we discovered that we had been successful. After all our earlier disappointments, it was hard to actually believe that everything would be all right – but it was. ‘We were amazed to learn that our son had been the first born in the UK using the technique. ‘This was a very exciting discovery for us, as we are both huge music lovers.’ Spanish researcher Carolina Castello added that there is no harm in those trying to conceive naturally playing music. She said: ‘Music is beneficial for everything.’","Freddie was conceived thanks to an IVF technique which involves playing music to eggs which are being fertilised artificially in a lab .

In fact the Sun turns out to be one of the roundest objects ever measured. Scaled down to the size of a beach ball, the difference between the Sun's widest and narrowest diameters would be far less than the width of a human hair. The Sun, seen here from the SOHO spacecraft during an eclipse, could be the roundest object ever measured, stunned researchers have discovered. Having no solid surface, the Sun's rotation should make it slightly flattened. But the new measurements show that the flattening is much smaller than expected. If the Sun was shrunk to a ball one metre across, its equatorial diameter would be only 17 millionths of a metre larger than the diameter between its poles. Scientists analysed data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory satellite which is studying the Sun. Previously it was thought that the shape of the Sun varied in cycles, but the new findings show it is remarkably constant. Lead researcher Dr Jeff Kuhn, from the University of Hawaii, said: 'For years we've believed our fluctuating measurements were telling us that the Sun varies, but these new results say something different. Researchers thought the Sun would be slightly flattened as it has no solid surface. 'While just about everything else in the Sun changes along with its 11-year sunspot cycle, the shape doesn't.' Sub-surface solar forces, such as . magnetism and turbulence, may be having a more powerful influence on the . Sun's shape than was previously thought, said the scientists . The research is published in Science Express, the online version of the journal Science.","Researchers admit they are baffled by the results .

A truly seven-day NHS is a step closer after doctors’ leaders softened their opposition to supermarket-style opening hours. After months of opposition to calls for seven-day services, the British Medical Association has agreed the quality of care provided in hospitals at the weekend needs to be improved. This removes one of the main obstacles to a seven-day NHS. The British Medical Association is now backing plans for a seven-day NHS service despite GPs opposing the idea when it was first announced . Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS’s medical . director, has said it is no longer acceptable for hospitals and GPs’ surgeries to operate for the convenience of their staff at the expense . of patients. He wants the NHS to learn from private . companies such as Tesco and make clinics and same-day operations . available seven-days a week. Just a few months ago the BMA declared . supermarket-style healthcare was ‘ridiculous’ and ‘utter folly’, The . doctors’ trade union has now conceded that consultants should spend more . time on the wards out-of-hours. Senior doctors have been accused of . merely popping into hospitals at weekends, leaving patients in the care . of less-experienced staff. The Mail recently revealed that just . five NHS trusts in England employ a consultant to work in A&E . overnight – even though thousands of patients turn up during these . hours. Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's medical director, talked of clinicians who want to 'solve the problem' Although most of the other hospitals have an ‘on-call’ consultant, junior staff are often reluctant to trouble them. In a newly published position paper on . seven-day services, the BMA acknowledges that  studies show death rates . are higher among patients admitted to hospital at the weekend. It also . notes that an inquiry into the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust, where up to . 1,200 patients are feared to have died unnecessarily in one of the worst . hospital scandals in living memory, found that patients felt vulnerable . at the weekend. The statement says: ‘Improving care . quality for patients means more staff, especially senior doctors, on . site at weekend and evenings.’ BMA chairman Dr Mark Porter denied the . organisation had made a ‘Damascene conversion’ and added: ‘Patients . should have greater access to high-quality care throughout the week and . doctors should be part of the solution.’ However the BMA has far from made a . complete U-turn, as it is still refusing to support proposals for full . supermarket-style opening hours. The BMA’s support is seen as vital in . instigating any changes and it insists financial pressures necessitate . that any extra weekend work should focus on only the most seriously ill . patients.","British Medical Association has changed its position to support plans for seven-day service .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:57 EST, 24 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:00 EST, 25 August 2013 . New York's attorney general has sued Donald Trump for $40 million, claiming the real estate mogul helped run a phony 'Trump University' that falsely promised to make students rich. Instead, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said that the university steered them into expensive and mostly useless seminars, and even failed to deliver promised apprenticeships. After the lawsuit was filed on Saturday, Trump shot back that it is false and politically motivated. Schneiderman says many of the 5,000 students who paid up to $35,000 thought they would at least meet Trump but instead all they got was their picture taken in front of a life-size picture of him. 'Trump University engaged in deception at every stage of consumers' advancement through costly programs and caused real financial harm,' Schneiderman said. Beleaguered: Donald Trump, pictured with his university emblem in May 2005, has been sued for $40 million after a lawsuit claims the classes were mostly useless and failed to live up to their promises . 'Trump University, with Donald Trump's knowledge and participation, relied on Trump's name recognition and celebrity status to take advantage of consumers who believed in the Trump brand.' State Education Department officials told Trump to change the name of his enterprise years ago, saying it . lacked a license and didn't meet the legal definitions of a university. In 2011 it was renamed the 'Trump Entrepreneur Institute', but it has since been . dogged by complaints from consumers and a few civil . lawsuits claiming it didn't fulfill its advertised claims. Schneiderman's . lawsuit covers complaints dating to 2005 through 2011 and it claims that students paid . between $1,495 and $35,000 to learn from the mogul. Complaint: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman brought the suit against Trump . He said the . three-day seminars failed to teach consumers everything they . needed to know about real estate, as the 'university' had promised. The Trump University manual tells . instructors not to let consumers 'think three days will be enough to . make them successful', Schneiderman said. At the seminars, . consumers were told about 'Trump Elite' mentorships that cost $10,000 to . $35,000 in which students were promised individual instruction until they made . their first deal. Schneiderman said participants were urged to extend . the limit on their credit cards for real estate deals, but then used the . credit to pay for the Trump Elite programs. The attorney general said . the program also failed to promptly cancel memberships as promised. The lawsuit added that many of students were unable to land even one real estate deal and were left far . worse off than before the lessons, facing thousands of dollars in debt. But . Trump's attorney accused Schneiderman of trying to extort campaign . contributions from the real estate mogul through his investigation. Attorney Michael D. Cohen told The Associated Press on Saturday that Schneiderman's lawsuit was filled with falsehoods. Cohen insisted that Trump and his university never defrauded anyone. 'The attorney general has been angry . because he felt that Mr. Trump and his various companies should have . done much more for him in terms of fundraising,' Cohen said. 'This . entire investigation is politically motivated and it is a tremendous . waste of taxpayers' money.' Angered: Trump accused the attorney general of being politically motivated with his lawsuit and said it was a way for Schneiderman to try to extort campaign contributions from him . State Board of Elections records show Trump has spent more than $136,000 on New York campaigns since 2010. He contributed $12,500 to Schneiderman in October 2010, when Schneiderman was running for attorney general, records show. An outspoken conservative, Trump himself flirted with a presidential run last year. 'Donald Trump will not sit back and be extorted by anyone, including the attorney general,' Cohen said. Schneiderman is suing the program, Trump as the university chairman, and the former president of the university in a case to be handled in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. He accuses them of engaging in persistent fraud, illegal and deceptive conduct and violating federal consumer protection law. The $40 million he seeks is mostly to pay restitution to consumers. He dismissed Trump's claim of a political motive. 'The fact that he's still brave enough to follow the investigation wherever it may lead speaks to Mr. Schneiderman's character,' Schneiderman spokesman Andrew Friedman told AP.","Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has accused university of encouraging students to pay for expensive, useless seminars .

But Much Loved isn't really about A-list bears. Instead, it's about telling the stories of 65 adored toy companions, old and young, from all over the world. 'It was seeing my son Calum with his Peter Rabbit, how he buried his head into it and squeezed it with delight [that inspired the book],' reveals Nixon. Much loved: Aisling Hurley's Pink Bear (left) and photographer Mark Nixon's faithful friend Panda . Companion: Patsy, who belongs to Tom McLoughlin and his son, has been stitched back together many times . 'It reminded me of my own Panda when I was a child. So I thought it would make a good exhibition for my studio, which has a gallery space. 'I had a Teddy Day and all my clients brought in their teddies, surprisingly much more adults than children. 'While waiting they would tell my receptionist some funny story or memory about their teddy and so I got her to write them down. I had the exhibition, put them on my site, and it went viral, 6.5m hits in a few months, all over the world.' Among them is the grumpy looking Pink Teddy, a 24-year-old toy that once lived in the cot of Aisling Hurley and Peter, a  'fifty-something' bear in a stylish knitted tank top that has been with owner Mave O'Connor since the day she was born.

'I’ve also met lots of . very angry adults whose parents thought they were doing the right thing by . getting rid of their child’s teddy.' More youthful bears in the book, include Beary, a striped pajama clad bear who belongs to six-year-old Tom O'Connor Jr. 'Tom turned six in September,' says his mother Sinead [not the singer Sinead O'Connor]. 'When he was born, he got the teddy as a gift from a friend of mine. 'Tom . calls the teddy Beary, and he goes everywhere with him. I always know . when Tom is tired - I hear him running upstairs to get Beary off his bed . for a cuddle.' While most of the toys featured in the book were easy to get hold of, according to Nixon, not everyone was quite so willing to part with their teddies - even for a few moments.

Old boys: 32-year-old Ear Open belongs to Maeve Whelan (left) but at 104, Melissa Nolan's Edward is the oldest . 'Rowan Atkinson’s [bear] was fairly easy [to get hold of] and Bono’s was the hardest, but only because it took about a year and a half to finally corner him,' says Nixon. 'Normally you’d bump into him here or there in Dublin but typically when you actually want to, he’s nowhere to be seen.

Captains are playing the popstar's hits at full volume to deter 'western culture-hating' pirates and stop them boarding the ships, merchant navy officer Rachel Owens revealed to the Metro. Classic hits Baby One More Time and Oops! I Did It Again are being used and have proved effective at stopping kidnap attempts from bandits. Second Officer Owens, who works on supertankers off the east coast of Africa, said: ‘Her songs were chosen by the security team because they thought the pirates would hate them most. ‘These guys can’t stand Western culture or music, making Britney’s hits perfect.’ Scroll down for video . 'Hit Me Baby, One More Time': Somali pirates apparently hate Western music - especially Britney Spears . Vessels in the area come under attack frequently from pirates who board the ships and demand multi-million-pound ransoms. One of the most high-profile cases was in 2009 when a 17,000 ton container ship, owned by Maersk Line, was been hijacked by Somalia pirates with 20 crew members aboard while sailing from Salalah in Oman to the Kenyan port of Mombassa via Djibouti. In 2011, there were 176 attacks on ships by gangs of bandits off the Horn of Africa. Most recently, last Thursday, Pirates attacked an oil supply vessel off the Nigerian coast and kidnapped the captain and chief engineer. They are such a threat, the Royal Navy has 1,500 sailors on 14 warships operating round-the-clock patrols in the area.

Deterrent: Britney Spears songs are played to pirates to deter them from boarding ships . Ms Owens, who guides tankers through the waters, said the ship’s speakers can be aimed at the pirates so the crew are not disturbed. ‘It’s so effective the ship’s security rarely needs to resort to firing guns,’ said the 34-year-old, from Gartmore, near Aberfoyle, Stirling. ‘As soon as the pirates get a blast of Britney, they move on as quickly as they can.’ Steven Jones, of the Security Association for the Maritime Industry, added: ‘Pirates will go to any lengths to avoid or try to overcome the music.’ 'I’d imagine using Justin Bieber would be against the Geneva Convention.’ Spears, who started her career in a 1990s revamp of the Mickey Mouse Club (with Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake... and Ryan Gosling), has always pointed to Madonna and Janet Jackson as two of her major influences. Perhaps now she can boast that warding off piracy on the high seas is an honour (albeit a dubious one) that Madonna and Jackson can't claim.","Captains playing Britney Spears hits to deter kidnaps .

A former schools administrator was sent to federal prison Monday for sending thousands of sexts to teen boys. Mark Kandel, 53, of Scranton, PA., was sentenced to 14 ½ years behind bars as part of a plea deal agreed to earlier this year. Once freed, he will have to register as a sex offender. In court, the depraved man’s daughter accused him of even going after her friends – this after he already served a 90-day house arrest in 2008 for providing alcohol to minors. The jig is up: Mark Kandel enters court to plead guilty to sexting minors . The former Scranton school director and board member was initially arrested last November after two teenage boys accused him of sending them lewd text messages, according to WNEP. Investigators eventually charged Mr Kandel with five counts of online enticement of teenage boys, but said they could have proved in court he sexted at least 17 boys, WBRE reported. Facing as much as 50 years in prison, Mr Kandel agreed to plead guilty to one count this past June. He admitted to contacting multiple minors via Facebook and text message, sending over 13,000 messages in total, reports said. The disgraced former mentor called his actions ‘inexcusable’ Monday in court before learning he would be locked up until he is 70-years-old,  according to reports. 'I take full responsibility for my inappropriate behavior,' Mr Kandel said. 'I have fallen as low as a person can fall.' Take him away boys!: The admitted pervert is hauled of to prison . ‘It was a difficult day for everybody but I know Mark is glad it's over,’ defense attorney Frank Santomauro said outside the court after the sentencing. ‘This court knows Mark is not a monster,’ the lawyer added. ‘He's got a life, he's got a family. He just went down the wrong path.’ Mr Kandel’s daughter saw things differently, calling him the ‘epitome of selfishness’ prior to his sentencing. She said the sexual predator lived a double life and went after her friends. 'This man, who I'm now ashamed to call my father, went after my own friends,' she said, according to the Scranton Times-Tribune. In 2008, Mr Kandel served a 90-day house arrest after admitting to providing minors with alcohol, said reports. His daughter said he because a different man from that point forward, a ‘stranger to them’ that was glued to his phone every night. Despite losing his family, job and reputation, Mr Kandel told the judge he wants to positively contribute to society when he leaves prison, reports said. ‘He's a bright guy and again, we just sometimes go a-stray,’ his lawyer said. ‘He's going to overcome it.’","Mark Kandel was a director with the Scranton school district .

The 'red dwarfs', which are up to ten times smaller and a thousand times less bright than the Sun, are the fastest moving such stellar partners in the Milky Way. It was always believed if binary stars form too close to each other, they would quickly mush together into one single, bigger one. This was in line with many observations taken over the last three decades showing the abundant population of stellar binaries, but none with orbital periods shorter than five hours. His team used the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) on Hawaii to track the red dwarfs which are described in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. About half the stars in the galaxy are, unlike our Sun, part of a binary system in which two stars orbit each other. Most likely, these were formed close together and have been in orbit around each other from birth onwards. A simplified diagram showing the sizes of stars. 80% of stars in our Milky Way galaxy are red dwarf stars . Although they form the most common type of star in the Milky Way, red dwarfs do not show up in normal surveys because of their dimness in visible light. For the last five years, UKIRT has been monitoring the brightness of hundreds of thousands of stars, including thousands of red dwarfs, in near-infrared light, using its state-of-the-art Wide-Field Camera (WFC). Since stars shrink in size early in their lifetime, the fact that these very tight binaries exist means that their orbits must also have shrunk as well since their birth, otherwise the stars would have been in contact early on and have merged. Co researcher Professor David Pinfield, of the University of Hertfordshire, added: ‘Without UKIRT's superb sensitivity, it would not have been possible to find these extraordinary pairs of red dwarfs.‘The active nature of these stars and their apparently powerful magnetic fields has profound implications for the environments around red dwarfs throughout our galaxy.’","Tiny red dwarf stars are fastest-moving stars in Milky Way .

The Church of Scientology has vehemently denied claims made in a sensational new book that Tom Cruise auditioned a host of Hollywood beauties including Scarlett Johansson, Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan and Kate Bosworth to be his wife before settling on Katie Holmes. Allegedly disappointed by his split from Oscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz in 2004 after she failed to embrace Scientology, Cruise, 50, allowed senior members of the church to summon the unwitting stars to read for a non-existent part in the 'Mission: Impossible' series. According to 'Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison Belief', the Top Gun star initiated the unusual casting couch-style marriage interviews after a complaint to his sister at a Scientology church opening in Madrid that no one had been able to find him a new girlfriend. Actresses Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba (right) were reportedly auditioned by Scientologist's looking to find a new wife for Tom Cruise . Actor Tom Cruise attends the 'Jack Reacher' press conference at Conrad Hotel on January 10, 2013 in Seoul, South Korea . Actresses Kate Bosworth and Lindsay Lohan were also reportedly considered for the role of Tom Cruise's wife and were asked to attend casting for a bogus role in a new Mission Impossible film . The Hollywood mega-star also allegedly made the same complaint to Scientologist leader and his best friend David Miscavige after his three year relationship with Cruz ended, who according to the book wasted no time in beginning the search for a suitable Mrs. Cruise. Lawyers for Tom Cruise have vehemently insisted that no such conversations ever occurred while he was in Spain. However, the tell-all book, penned by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Lawrence Wright, alleges that Scientologist matchmakers arranged for 'auditions' at the organisation's Celebrity Center in Los Angeles and invited the bevy of what were young and promising actresses. The book claims that each of the girls including hell-raiser Lohan, who was 18 in 2004, Alba, who is now happily married with two children and Johansson, were not chosen and in 2005 Cruise instead met Katie Holmes and then infamously jumped on Oprah Winfrey's couch. Marriage: Actors Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise arrive at the 2012 Vanity Fair Oscar Party hosted by Graydon Carter at Sunset Tower on February 26, 2012 in West Hollywood, California . Holmes, who is now 34, split from Tom cruise in 2012 and took primary custody of their child, Suri. The book also claims that prior to the auditions of the would-be stars, Cruise was hooked up with British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi, who is now 32. Vanity Fair magazine's special correspondent Maureen Orth reported that Shelly Miscavige, the wife of David Miscavige was part of the search to find Tom Cruise a suitable girlfriend. The magazine contended that Boniadi was convinced by Scientology leaders that she had been selected for a project that would help further her religion and would lead to her meeting 'world leaders' and having an influential role in the church. Allegedly, top Scientology official Greg Wilhere told the actress to darken her hair, remove her orthodontic braces and that she break up with her long term boyfriend, who was also part of the controversial religion and with whom she was reportedly deeply in love. When she refused to do that, Wilhere allegedly showed Boniadi evidence that her boyfriend had cheated on her and that led her to break up their relationship. Tom Cruise allegedly became disappointed by the break down in his relationship with Penelope Cruz in 2004 and asked Scientologist leader David Miscavige (right) for his help . Tom Cruise during his much-maligned couch jumping episode in 2005 on Oprah as he declared his love for Katie Holmes . She was flown to New York to meet Cruise and he swept her off her feet with an amazing series of dates that included visits to the Empire State Building, dinner at Nobu, skating at the Rockefeller Center and nights spent at the Trump Tower. In fact, she so impressed Cruise that he asked her to sign a nondisclosure agreement, which is generally acknowledged to be a sign that the actor is keen to persue the relationship and make it serious. Tommy Davis, a Scientology executive, told Boniadi that her new life with Cruise was all about keeping him happy. 'Davis warned her that if she did anything to upset Cruise, he would personally destroy her,' the book reported. 'Davis and (Scientology official) Jessica Feshback were constantly tutoring her in how to behave toward the star.' The auditions for the role of Tom Cruise's new wife allegedly took place at the Church of Scientology's Celebrity Center in Los Angeles . However, the pairing did not work out and Feshback is said to have ordered Boniadi to pack her belongings and leave Cruise's home. She is said to have last seen the Hollywood actor working out in his home gym and has never heard from him again. And when she confessed her love for Cruise to another Scientologist, the church sent her to Clearwater in Florida and asked her to scrub public toilets with a toothbrush, the book reported. The church has denied all allegations of cruelty towards Boniadi for speaking to anyone about Tom Cruise. The reason for the unusual auditions organised by the Church of Sceintology stem from their interest in keeping their best known member happy. He is also a huge donor to the religion, reportedly handing over $3 million in 2004 alone. Divorce: Katie Holmes attends ""12-12-12"" a concert benefiting The Robin Hood Relief Fund to aid the victims of Hurricane Sandy at Madison Square Garden . Nazanin Boniadi reportedly dated Tom Cruise before his marriage to Katie Holmes . Before his marriage to Holmes, Cruise and Miscavige harbored political ambitions for the actor, alleges the book. 'If f******g Arnold (Schwarzenegger) can be governor, I could be President,' said Cruise. 'Well, absolutely, Tom,' replied Miscavige. Lawyers for Cruise have denied that converstaion ever took place. The book also details Cruise's failed attempts to try and recruit Steven Spielberg into the Scientology fold after the Oscar winning director cast the actor in 'War of the Worlds'. However, Cruise became angered after her learnt of a conversation between Spielberg and Paul Haggis, the director of the Oscar winning movie 'Crash'. Allegations: Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief by Lawrence Wright will be published on January 17 . 'I've met all these Scientologists, and they seem like the nicest people,' Spielberg is alleged to have said reports the New York Daily News. 'Yea, we keep all the evil ones in the closet,' replied Haggis, who at the time was a Scientologist before leaving the church in 2009. Haggis says that he was called in by the church executives for a dressing down over the remarks and ordered to write a letter of apology to Cruise. When his first draft was rejected, Haggis was made to write an even more contrite letter to Tom Cruise. A Spielberg publicist said the director doesn’t recall the brief exchange with Haggis, and Cruise’s lawyer said the actor does not remember the incident.","A controversial new book claims that Scarlett Johansson, Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan and Kate Bosworth were 'auditioned' to be Tom Cruise's wife .

Big spender: Ten years on from her £1.9million win, 26-year-old Callie Rogers has just £2,000 in the bank . At 16 she became Britain’s youngest lottery jackpot winner, but her £1.9million prize proved more of a curse than a blessing. Callie Rogers gave up her job and frittered most of her money on parties, drugs, cosmetic surgery, holidays and gifts. Ten years on, Miss Rogers has only £2,000 left in the bank – but says she has never felt happier. For instead of bringing happiness, her riches left her feeling so lonely and vulnerable that she attempted suicide. Now the 26-year-old is training to be a nurse and shops for bargains in Tesco. The closest she comes to splashing out is ordering a Friday night takeaway. She lives in a modest £80,000 three-bedroom house in Workington, Cumbria with her partner, fireman Paul Penny, 34, and son Blake, one. Her new life has not been free from tragedy, however – Blake was one of twins but his brother Mason was stillborn. Miss Rogers, who has two children aged eight and six from a previous relationship, said: ‘I can’t believe ten years have passed since I stood holding that huge cheque. ‘It feels like a lifetime ago. I was too young to win the lottery – I don’t think 16-year-olds should be eligible. ‘It was too much money for someone so young. Even if you say your life won’t change, it does – and often not for the better. It nearly broke me, but thankfully, I’m now stronger. ‘I try to forget the ups and downs I’ve been through and just feel like a normal person. ‘The pressure to splash out and live a glam party life has gone – and I prefer it.’ Beginner's luck: Ms Rogers from Cumbria found that money doesn't buy happiness. She spent £250,000 on cocaine and blew her riches on lavish gifts and designer clothes . Fortune: Callie Rogers posed for Closer magazine in 2010. She spent thousands of pounds on breast implants and said she attempted suicide three times after her riches made her miserable . Miss Rogers, who works two days a . week as a carer for the elderly and is taking an NVQ in caring in . preparation for a nursing course next year, met Mr Penny in 2010. Story: Miss Rogers told Closer magazine that she now works two days a . week as a carer for the elderly . ‘Paul had no idea who I was or that I was ever a millionaire,’ she said. ‘I didn’t tell him – after a while, he found out from mates, but he fell for me, not the money. ‘We’re a normal family. We shop at Tesco, save for holidays and stay in with takeaways. ‘My . life revolves around the kids and, if they want something expensive, . they wait for birthdays and Christmas. I’m glad they’ll grow up knowing . the value of money.’ At the time of her win, Miss Rogers was living with foster parents and earning £3.60 an hour as a Co-op checkout girl. Within weeks, she met Nicky Lawson, father of her eldest two children, and moved into a £180,000 bungalow. She says she spent £250,000 on cocaine during their relationship. She quit work and splashed out on designer clothes, lavish presents for her biological parents and holidays. She told Closer magazine: ‘I got up late and lived on takeaways. And so-called mates would come over until the early hours to party. ‘Suddenly, I was a local celeb and people would come up to me in pubs as if they were my best friend and I felt pressure to buy them all drinks. I didn’t know who to trust.’ She added: ‘For so long, I drifted with no aims.

Firearms can be discharged underwater but bullets lose velocity rapidly and are rendered less lethal beyond a metre. The entire gun has to be submerged in water, with all air pockets removed in order to prevent a possible explosion when firing. The water pressure can cause used cartridge casings to fail to leave gun chambers after they were fired, which can make a gun only able to fire a single bullet.

Reports about the loss of family values and increased selfish behaviours can be observed on a daily basis, however the overall picture is not as dire as an angry morning commute might suggest. New research has revealed that the nation’s values are far more positive and community centred than might be expected, and show that meaningful interpersonal relationships are still central in the lives of most Britons. Despite the woes of modern life, it seems family and caring are still the most highly rated values of Britons today . The Barrett Values Centre asked 4000 people across the UK to pick the 10 values or behaviours that most reflect who they are. The top two most common values were ‘caring’ (49 per cent) and ‘family’ (46 per cent). 'Honesty' (40 per cent) and 'humour/fun' (39 per cent) and were also in the top five values and behaviours people throughout he UK feel reflect who they are. Equal and high quality relationships were shown to matter to Britons as all four countries identified friendship (30 per cent), fairness (27 per cent) and compassion (36 per cent) in their top ten values. Respondents also said they experienced values in their local community that largely matched their own values, in terms of family and friendship. Values tended to be similar for respondents in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, although Scots said the values ‘respect’ and ‘trust’ were more important than their UK counter parts. Northern Ireland was the only country to list ‘commitment’ in their top ten values. Humour and friendship were top ten values for every country in the UK . The authors of the study Richard Barrett . and Phil Clothier use their findings to describe the personality of a . UK citizen: ‘Citizens of the UK have a strong set of relationship values . that influence how they treat others and how they wish to be treated. The survey shows Britain is a far more positive place than your morning commute might suggest . ‘Having close relationships and connections with others is extremely important to them. They need to feel a sense of love and belonging. If these needs are threatened or not met they will experience anxiety about not being accepted or not being loved . They seek to ensure people are treated justly and fairly and have a fun-loving approach to life and enjoy sharing good times.’ The survey also breaks England into regions to analyze their values and while six values remain the same, there are some interesting differences. The biggest difference is between London are the rest of the UK, who value trust and fairness less than the rest of the UK. Unsurprisingly to those who live in the Capital, creativity and ambition were only listed as top ten values in London . Respect and fairness are in the top ten values of seven regions but ‘fairness’ doesn’t come in the top ten of London and the Westmidlands, and respect is not in the top ten values North West and South West. The North East and the South West of the UK were the only two regions to list patience in their values.","4000 people in UK picked the 10 values that most reflect who they are .
