"Foo Fighters legend Dave Grohl has a reputation for being the nicest man in rock music - and he  lived up to the title during the band's concert in Sydney. During the show on Wednesday night, 46-year-old Grohl noticed a banner being held up by a blind man in the front row of the ANZ Stadium. The sign read: 'drum stick for a blind guy plz’ and Grohl obliged, grabbing a stick from drummer Taylor Hawkins in between songs and handing the highly-prized memento to the man with the banner. Scroll down for video . During the Foo Fighters concert in Sydney on Wednesday night, 46-year-old Grohl noticed a banner being held up by a blind man in the front row of the ANZ Stadium . On Tuesday night the band kicked off the Australian leg of their Sonic Highways world tour in Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium before taking to the Sydney stage on Wednesday night. Grohl and the Foo Fighters gave the fans what they wanted, playing old favourites and some classic covers from their 20-year career. However, Grohl went that extra yard with his super fan, singling him out from the rest of the crowd and giving him the momento of his dreams. On the screen, the banner which read 'Drumstick for a blind guy plz' appeared . Grohl walked over to the blind fan and gave him the best momento of the night . 'There’s a guy in the front row he’s got a sign that says ‘drum stick for a blind guy’', the former Nirvana member said into the microphone. The band then casually continued with their set, as the audience whooped in delight. However, one family were left upset at the Sydney concert when Grohl didn't dedicate his hit song My Hero to a boy who died earlier this month from septicaemia. Despite being petitioned by family and friends of Kim online, the band failed to mention that they were singing the song in tribute to 12-year-old Blake Roberts. Grohl went that extra yard with his super fan, singling him out from the rest of the crowd and giving him the momento of his dreams . The Best Of You hitmakers will next hit up Melbourne before moving to Tasmania and Adelaide and ending their stint in Australia on March eight in Perth . The song was played at Blake's funeral last week, and after the mother of four decided to attend the concert, friends and strangers rallied around to get the band to mention the young fan to the 80,000 strong crowd at the sold out concert. A social media campaign was started on Wednesday by Kim's friend Marg Lucan. While the group didn't dedicate the track to the young leukaemia patient, they did invite Kim, Marg and their group, which is understood to have included his 17-year-old sister Ellie, to a VIP area backstage at the concert. Earlier in the afternoon, Marg thanked those who shared her initial post of Kim's request for the on-stage dedication. Guest of honour: The band had a special guest in the audience on Tuesday night, as Johnny Depp, Down Under to film the next Pirates Of The Caribbean film, was seen backstage prior to the show . However, one family were left upset at the Sydney concert when Grohl didn't dedicate his hit song My Hero to Blake Roberts (pictured) who died earlier this month from septicaemia . In the emotional message, she wrote light-heartedly: 'Blake always wanted to be famous.' 'Let's hope his name gets mentioned in front of 80,000 screaming fans tonight. 'I can see him smiling at the very thought of this! Just quietly, it's looking good!' Marg said. The 12-year-old from Wattle Grove in Sydney's South had been battling leukemia for the past six months. But just weeks after the family were given the good news that Blake wouldn't need a bone marrow transplant, he contracted the deadly infection and passed away on February 14. Despite being petitioned by family and friends of Kim online, the band failed to mention that they were singing the song in tribute to 12-year-old Blake Roberts . The Foo Fighters tour started in South Africa, back in December, before moving to South America for several performances and then on to Australia. The band had a special guest in the audience on Tuesday in Brisbane, as Johnny Depp, Down Under to film the next Pirates Of The Caribbean film, was seen backstage prior to the show.

"Here's a sobering thought for anyone who’s ever been tempted to have a sangria or three too many on holiday. Winding your way back to your villa or hotel could be about to become even more fraught... because Spain is considering breathalysing pedestrians. A crackdown on ‘drink-walking’ has been proposed by the country’s Directorate General of Traffic as part of a raft of measures aimed at improving road safety. Spanish authorities are looking to breathalyse pedestrians who are involved in accidents. Pictured is the tourist hotspot La Rambla, Barcelona . The draft legislation would see pedestrians subjected to on-the-spot alcohol and drug testing if they are implicated in an accident, just as drivers involved in them are. Supporters of the scheme, which would also see pedestrians reclassified as ‘users of the road’ with the same responsibilities to keep safe as drivers, hope it will deter drunks from staggering into the path of oncoming traffic. But critics such as the group La Red de Ciudades que Caminan (The Network of Walking Cities), which encourages city-goers to get around on foot, have said it is tantamount to ‘criminalising pedestrians’ when they in fact ‘normally tend to be the victims’. The traffic directorate insist that police can already carry out alcohol and drugs tests on pedestrians, who are thought to have broken the law. Maria Segui Gomes, the organisation’s director, said: ‘Municipal police have been carrying out these tests for months – there is nothing new here that will allow us to start sanctioning pedestrians, whether economically or with penalty points.’ A 2011 study published in the Journal of Trauma found 55 per cent of walkers under the influence of alcohol ignored pedestrian crossings, compared to just 22 per cent of sober ones. Around one pedestrian in seven injured on the roads in Britain is drunk at the time, according to Department of Transport figures.","Spain is considering breathalysing pedestrians involved in road accidents .

"Real estate tycoon Donald Trump brought an aggressive if vague platform to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, but raised eyebrows with his continued questions about President Barack Obama's birth certificate. He hammered Hillary and Bill Clinton, saying the former president would soon face new troubles related to his friendship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Clinton is a 'nice guy,' Trump said, but 'he's got a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island' where Epstein entertained his wealthy and famous friends – allegedly with sex parties featuring underage girls. The former U.S. president took a trip there in 2002. Scroll down for video . Donald Trump insisted Hillary Clinton was the first birther but said he still has questions about where President Barack Obama was born . THE DOCUMENT: The White House released President Barack Obama's long-form Hawaii birth certificate on April 27, 2011 as 'birther' conspiracy theories swirled . Trump's return to birtherville came at the tail end of his star turn at CPAC, the annual cavalcade of conservative catnip that serves as a vetting ground for potential presidential contenders. He said he still wonders 'whether or not it was the real birth certificate' that the White House released in 2011. 'I certainly question it. ... We have to find out whether or not it was real,' he told a near-capacity crowd in a Maryland resort ballroom. After his speech, Trump told Daily Mail Online that 'the positive response today at CPAC was enormous.' He noted that Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity brought up the birth certificate during a Q&A session. The U.S. Constitution says only a 'natural born citizen' can become president, making questions about a candidate's birthplace red meat for opponents. Trump has floated a variety of theories explaining why he thinks the president has hidden the circumstances of his birth, At one 2014 press conference he suggested that Obama might have lied about his birthplace in order to get preferential treatment in university admissions. When he flirted with a run in the 2012 presidential contest he offered a $5 million charity bounty for the release of the birth certificate, the president's college records, and his passport applications. The birth certificate – but nothing else – followed. 'I'd still like to see his college records,' he said at CPAC on Friday. 'I think it's important.' FIRST BIRTHER? The idea that Barack Obama wasn't born in the US, and is therefore ineligible to be president, originated with Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential primary campaign – which was later defeated by Obama's . Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, near the nation's capital . He also reminded the crowd that Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign was the first to suggest Obama was born outside the U.S., saying that it would make him ineligible to run. That came as the two were locked in a Democratic primary slugfest. Eight years later Mrs. Clinton is the Democrats' heir apparent, attracting shots from all Republican quarters – including Trump's. 'As far as his birth certificate, Hillary wanted his birth certificate,' he jabbed at CPAC. 'Hillary is a birther.' He told Daily Mail Online that both 'Hillary Clinton and John McCain were birthers – but failed birthers.' 'I was able to get him to release the document or whatever it was that he released,' he said. 'He didn't do it for them; he did it for me.'","'We have to find out whether or not it was real,' the real estate tycoon said Friday of the Obama birth certificate the White House released in 2012 .
But 'Hillary is a birther' too, he insisted, recalling her 2008 campaign's role in first questioning whether the president was born in the US .
Also said Bill Clinton's woes linked to Epstein's 'famous island' aren't over .
Trump is between 75 and 80 per cent sure he's running for president, he told the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, DC ."
"When police came to the door of Sandra Smith's suburban family home in East London, seven years ago she refused to believe what they were telling her. They broke the news that her partner, Martin, 43, who had said goodbye to her and their four children on his way to work that morning, had killed himself. Recalling that terrible day, Sandra, now 51, told MailOnline: 'It seemed like I was having open heart surgery without anaesthetic. I was hysterical, crying, my body was shaking and nothing was helping me deal with this grief. Sandra Smith with partner Martin who took his own life when she was 43 after suffering from depression . Following Martin's death, Sandra, centre, was left to raise their four children, Emma, then 17, Hannah then 10, Laura, then aged seven and Charlie, then six . 'I could not believe the love of my life was gone. I could not believe he had done it.' Martin had been suffering from depression and Sandra said he had been under a lot of pressure in his job as an estate agent. She said: 'He was a manger and had a lot of responsibility. He was really stressed and really suffering. It had all got on top of him. 'We had tried to sort it out over the years before he died, but he did keep how bad it was from me. 'When the day came that the police knocked on my door to tell me he had taken his own life, I was gobsmacked. I know because he loved us so much, he didn't want us to know how much pain he was in.' Sandra, who was 44 when Martin died, was left to raise their four children, Emma, then 17, Hannah then 10, Laura, then aged seven and Charlie, then six. Sandra, now 51, left, was helped through her grief by Olive Brade, right, who had also lost her husband . 'It has been very hard - I have been a double parent, mum and dad in every aspect of their lives,' Sandra said. 'From schooling and homework to taking Charlie to football, keeping the house going – it has been extremely hard but do-able. 'With my sense of humour and determination, I was going to let this bring me down. It is still difficult, we have our ups and downs just like any normal family.' The first hurdle Sandra had to overcome was explaining to her youngest children the loss of their father when they were too young to understand the mental turmoil he had been in. 'I'll always remember what Charlie said to me. He was only six at the time and he asked me if he had anything wrong. I told him, ""no, you didn't do anything wrong, and neither did daddy"". 'He did he best to conquer it, he did what he could. I did think, ""why does he want to leave us?"", but I knew in the end that he just couldn't carry on anymore.' Martin and Sandra had been teenage sweethearts after meeting at a nightclub and she was devastated by the loss of her long-term partner and best friend. Sandra and Olive set up the Drop In Bereavement Centre in Newham, London, to help others . Linda, pictured, and Olive have been given awards for their charity work which is supported by Red Nose Day . She went through the motions of looking after the children but inside she was suffering intense pain and grief. The dental nurse was prescribed three different types of pills by her GP and went to counselling sessions to help her try and come to terms with her loss and deal with her feelings of despair. But it was only after meeting Olive Brade, whose husband had also recently died, that she began to realise the value of talking to people who have been through bereavement themselves. Describing their first meeting, Sandra said: 'It was so nice to speak to someone who was going through the same as me, she had lost her husband too. 'We got strength from each other. We would speak every day and check up on each other.' The pair realised that other people who had lost loved ones could gain the same support from others if only they knew where to turn. 'We decided there were not enough services out there for people like us, and that people with knowledge of dealing with bereavement should share it,' Sandra said. So they set up the Drop In Bereavement Centre in Newham, East London with the help of cash raised through Red Nose Day. Linda said Martin - pictured with her when they were in their late thirties - was the love of her life and she will always miss him . The centre offers an alternative to the clinical style setting of NHS bereavement counselling services. They provide yoga, reiki and reflexology as well as grief counselling and expert advice with a warm welcome, tea and biscuits and a relaxing garden that is tended by one of its service users. Now seven years on, the centre is thriving and has helped many people deal with the loss of a love one. Sandra said: 'We just thought if we can help just one person, then we can change a life. We have a waiting list of people who want to see us. People come to see us from all over. We know we are doing the right thing running the centre and we know it works. 'People tell us how much it helps them and we would love to see more bereavement centres like ours around the country. I still need support myself and get that at the centre. Linda and Olive have helped many people deal with grief thanks to their drop in centre . Sandra said she has learnt to coped with Martin's death thanks to her sense of humour, determination and the support she has received from friends like Olive . She added: 'Everybody is going to go through bereavement. But it's too big a thing to do on your own and you need to speak to someone who has gone through it and can teach you the tools of how to cope.' Sandra and her children, now aged 25, 18, 15 and 14, will always miss Martin and the centre has been a big help to them. Sandra said: 'The children found it very hard but are coping very well but they did, and still do get, frustrated at times that they haven’t got a dad to turn. 'As they grow older there are things that they would have wanted to ask their dad to help with or for advice on – even things like getting a mortgage - they would have asked their dad about. 'Martin will be missed forever. When you lose someone you truly love you will always miss them but you learn to live and cope.'","Sandra Smith was 44 when her partner, Martin, 43, killed himself .

"An autistic man was awarded $2.5million in damages by after an antipsychotic drug he took as a boy led him to grow enormous breasts, Philadelphia common pleas court said. The  jury concluded on Tuesday that Austin Pledger, 20, 'was not adequately warned' that he would grow size 46DD breasts as a side effect of taking Risperdal, produced by Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen Pharmeceuticals. Pledger's mother, Benita Pledger, testified about the breasts' impact on her son's life and how they affected his self confidence, the man's lawyer, Thomas Kline said. Though he began producing breasts shortly after he started taking the medication in 2002 when he was eight years old, Pledger, from Thorsby, Alabama, has yet to have a mastectomy. Austin Pledger, 20, was awarded $2.5million in damages after he grew size 46DD breasts as a side effect of Risperdal, an antipsychotic medication he took when he was a boy . Risperdal was approved for the use in children in 2006, though Pledger started using the drug at age eight in 2002. Its FDA label in 2006 warned of high levels of prolactin, a hormone that promotes breast growth . 'The testimony of his mother before the jury is he would smash them on a table,' Kline told People. 'And that when he gets out of the shower he covers himself in a towel before he looks at himself in a mirror.' The medication, which had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration that was prescribed by his family physician had a label that said the risk of gynecomastia - the condition that causes men to grow female breasts - was low,  Kline said. The FDA approved the use of Risperdal as a schizophrenic aid for children in 2006, and warned that it was high levels of prolactin, which is a hormone that promotes breast growth, according to Philly.com. Since Pledger had been taking the drug for four years, he had already began to develop female-like breasts, which now can only be removed through a mastectomy, the court heard. Kline said that Pledger's mother 'had no idea' the drug was associated with the growth of breasts. Benita Pledger (left) testified in front of the Philadelphia court and described the breasts' impact on her son's (right) life. She said that when he gets out of the shower he won't look in the mirror without covering himself with a towel first . 'Austin is among the most vulnerable and precious in our world,' he told People. 'These decisions are difficult and even more so when the child is frail, like Austin, so his mom has been very slow and patient.' Pledger's doctor, Jay Mathissen, testified that he, too, was unaware that gynecomastia was a side effect of the drug. A spokeswoman for Janssen Pharmaceuticals said the company is 'disappointed' with the outcome of the hearing and believes the 'verdict should be overturned'. She claimed that the side effects of Risperdal were clearly communicated to Pledger, his family and doctor. Robyn Reed, the company's director of product communication, said Pledger's 'quality of life was significantly improved during the time he was taking Risperdal'. She added that the FDA-approved label on the drug 'properly warned' the family 'of the medication's potential side effects'. Pledger's case is the first of more than 1,200 filed over Risperdal in Philadelphia, according to Kline.","Austin Pledger began taking Risperdal in 2002 when he was eight, before it was approved for children by the Food and Drug Administration .

"A range of contact lenses has been developed that the makers claim can make the wearer look younger and more attractive. The Acuvue Define lenses have a pigment inside that helps to define the border around the iris, known as the limbal ring. This ring naturally fades with age and poor health, so improving the definition is said to make us look more youthful, and healthier. Scroll down for video . The eye's have it: The limbal ring is often known as nature's eye-liner'. The new lenses (pictured right) claim to make eyes look younger by defining the edge of a person's iris, a quality said to have an anti-aging effect . Product designer Angie Bowers said: 'The limbal ring is often known as ""nature's eye-liner"". 'In fact, studies show faces with a more distinctive definition around the limbal ring are rated as more attractive. 'Since a limbal ring usually fades over time, a defined one can suggest youthfulness and good health.' A limbal ring is a dark circle that appears around the iris of your eye - the coloured part. The rings are typically less than a millimetre thick, and are associated with youthfulness - the rings are darker when a person is a child, and fade with age. Some studies have also claimed that a more prominent limbal ring is a sign of attractiveness. The lenses can be used by people with dark or lighter eyes, she added. Lenses for lighter eyes are described as giving a 'sparkle effect' and those for darker eyes are described as giving a 'shimmer effect'. In 2011, researchers from the University of California Irvine conducted a study in which participants were shown a set of 80 pairs of faces and asked to rate them for attractiveness. The faces in each pair were the same except one had been digitally altered to have a darkened limbal ring. Looking good: The limbal ring ring naturally fades with age and poor health, so improving the definition is said to make us look more youthful, and healthier, a study has claimed (before and after of lenses pictured) Age fades the colour in a person's eye (stock image of elderly man pictured), but if someone has high cholesterol there can be a white ring in the clear cornea and this deposit dulls the iris colour too . The pattern on the Natural Shimmer lens (top) gives it more depth and provides an intense effect whereas the pattern on the Natural Sparkle lens (bottom) provides a luminous and brightening effect . The researchers found that the male and female participants, who were not aware of what had been changed, overwhelmingly preferred the photos showing the darker limbal rings. The scientists, who published their research in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, suggested that we have evolved to find faces with more defined limbal rings as more attractive because they signal that the person is young and healthy enough to reproduce with. Dr Robert Burriss, a psychologist at Northumbria University who specialises in attractiveness, said: 'The limbal ring fades over time, so it is used - unconsciously - as an indicator of age. 'This is interesting because we perceive most other indicators of age - wrinkled skin, grey hair, voice, changes in posture - consciously. 'But I'm pretty sure most people have never given their limbal rings a second thought!' Consultant ophthalmologist Julian Stevens said there is nothing we can do to prevent the natural fading of the limbal ring with the passage of time - but certain conditions can make it worse. 'The iris pigment can fall out over the years, so the colour fades,' he said. 'But if someone has high cholesterol there can be a white ring in the clear cornea and this deposit dulls the iris colour too.'","The Acuvue Define lenses have a pigment inside that helps to define the border around the iris, known as the limbal ring .

"Travelling can be testing when you're carrying extra weight. Whether it's squeezing into too small plane seats, discomfort in hotels or not being able to join more active tour groups, being a larger person comes with tribulations. But thanks to a thoughtful travel company in the U.S overweight travellers needn't be restricted in their travel plans. Tony Harrell, CEO of Abundant Travel, and board member of the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, says people deserve their first choice of holiday 'no matter what their size'. CEO of Abundant Travel, Tony Harrell, says people deserve the holiday they want, whatever their size . Harrells' main inspiration, was his wife, who is as he describes her 'a larger person'. 'While working in another area of the travel industry, I started to hear numerous stories from the plus-sized friends in my social circle about the challenges they faced in planning and enjoying their vacations,' he tells MailOnline Travel. 'One of them happens to be the lady who would later become my wife.' 'I was inspired by my experience getting to know friends of size across North America, especially my wife with whom I have taken numerous trips. The average plane seat has shrunk to the point where many average or 'typical-sized' people feel cramped . Harrell books hotels, flights, rentals and cruises for his customers, whom he treats with the utmost respect . 'Having listened to their concerns, I have gained a rare understanding of the needs of the traveler of size. I saw an opportunity to fill a need for an understanding travel consultant for travelers of size,' he says. Harrell lists the concerns of the overweight traveller as worrying about whether hotels can cater for them; if staff will be friendly and whether locations are known for glamorous thin types, or regular  people of every shape and size. Using his travel expertise and contacts, Harrell books hotels, flights, holiday rentals and cruises for his customers, whom he treats with the utmost respect. 'I offer access to my knowledge base and industry contacts in order to maximize the comfort level of my clients,' he says. Harrell recommends New Orleans for travellers 'of size' partly for its laid bag joie de vivre . Book your flights early for the best airfare and seat selection . Many airlines will enforce the purchase of a second seat if yu cannot lower both arm reset and fasten the seatbelt . The average plane seat is 18 inches. A window seat gives more shoulder room, but the same hip room. On many planes the seats in First are larger, but the arm rests do not necessarily go up between them. Book your second 'comfort seat' directly with the airline rather than online to ensure your seat selection is correct. Familiarise yourself with the airports you will be travelling to and from. Wheelchairs and electric buggies are often available if you need them. Source: Association for Airline Passenger Rights . 'I might endeavor to confirm that clients who have acknowledged their limited mobility receive rooms that are close to the elevator.In some cases, I may request an accessible room, whether or not they have need of a wheelchair or scooter. 'For those who want to sight-see, I might recommend a private car rental/hire with a personal driver. 'For those who just want to relax at a resort, I might recommend a smaller boutique property rather than the larger hotels. 'The most consistent challenge would be air travel,' says Harrell, who says when he flies with his wife, the couple always book three seats. Abundant Travel offers clients the opportunity to be candid about their needs, says Harrell . 'The average plane seat has shrunk to the point where many average or ""typical-sized"" people feel cramped. The situation is even more amplified for passengers of size. 'I help my clients determine whether it's best to invest in additional or upgraded seating or, when available, choose the rare airlines that are willing to accommodate customers of size at little to no extra investment.' Where does he recommend for larger travellers? 'The destination I enjoy promoting the most is New Orleans, Louisiana right here in the States,' he says. 'I find the laid-back joie de vivre to be welcoming for most anyone. It doesn't hurt that restaurants are usually rather generous with their portions. 'I offer my clients the opportunity to be candid about their needs and concerns with someone who will be understanding and respectful. 'As for the typical vacation investment, ""the sky's the limit"" as the saying goes. It all depends on what kind of experience the client wants and how much they are willing to invest to make it happen.","Abundant Travel offers 'people  of size' comfortable travel itineraries .

"One college student's wedding dreams came true when a generous stranger and fellow bride-to-be anonymously paid for the costly gown she had fallen in love with - but couldn't afford. Liz Jensen, a 21-year-old full-time student at Brigham Young University, was shopping at Elizabeth Cooper Design in Provo, Utah, when she found a $480 wedding dress which was perfect in every way – apart from the price tag. However, as fate would have it, an anonymous bride-to-be chose that very day to give the shop's owner, Carrie Ling, enough money to pay for any dress in the room with the promise that the donation would go to a woman who needed help buying her dream gown. Young love: Liz Jensen, a 21-year-old student at Brigham Young University, is engaged to marry Jimmy Gillespie, 21 . Good deed: While shopping for her wedding dress, a generous stranger anonymously paid for the dream gown that Miss Jensen could not afford. The dress (pictured) is now hanging in the student’s apartment in Utah . 'When I was told in the store that someone had paid for my wedding dress, I was overcome with emotion,' Miss Jensen told Daily Mail Online in an email. 'Never had I received such a direct answer to prayer.' Like most typical college students, Miss Jensen, who is seventh out of eight children, was financially strapped, but determined to finance as much of her wedding as she could on her own. Although the shop she was visiting specialized in modest, affordable gowns that range from $300 to $550, she also had her college tuition fees to think of. The one: This bride can be seen wearing the wedding gown that Miss Jensen had fallen in love with . Classic white: The dress (pictured) retails for $480 at Elizabeth Cooper Design, a store that specializes in modern, affordable bridal gowns . Popped the question: Mr Gillespie proposed to Miss Jensen on a winter's day with the help of some family members . Miss Jensen revealed that before she went to her appointment to try on dresses she said a small prayer asking God to help her find a way to pay for her bridal gown if she found one. 'I knew that my tuition costs needed to be paid soon, but I also knew that if I found the right dress that morning, I would need to pay for it,' she explained. 'The mystery fellow bride who so graciously served me on Friday was not in my room when I prayed that morning...,' she said. 'I don't know what inspired her. I don't know if it was planned, or spur-of-the-moment. But I do know that she was a direct instrument in God's hands.' Special moment: The bride-to-be and her new fiance can be seen showing of her engagement ring . Save the date: Mr Gillespie and Miss Jensen cuddled up and smiled for the camera following his proposal last month . Miss Jensen received her 'miraculous wedding dress' from her 'anonymous angel', only a month after her fiance Jimmy Gillespie, 21, got down on one knee and proposed. She said she chose to share her incredible story in order to express her 'extreme gratitude and to inspire others'. The act of kindness that was bestowed upon her has also motivated Miss Jensen to have a 'Pay It Forward' theme for the May 1 nuptials. I do: After getting engaged a month ago, the couple is set to get married on May 1 . Summer loving: The Brigham Young University students posed for a photo during a trip to the beach . 'You don't necessarily have to go buy a person's wedding dress to help someone,' she said. 'It is in the little things that hearts will be touched and softened. This experience has changed my lifelong perspective.' Miss Jensen noted that is so easy be self-absorbed with our personal situations and financial struggles. 'This experience caused me to look outside of myself and to want to do good...,' she said. 'I am excited to give to other people who need the help as I did.' And although her benefactor has chosen to remain anonymous, Miss Jensen wants her to know that she has an open invitation to her spring wedding.","Liz Jensen, 21, was shopping at Elizabeth Cooper Design in Provo, Utah when she found the $480 dream dress .

Among the other words that feature are 'brave', 'insane', 'scary' and 'corrupt'. A 25-year-old man puts a positive spin on the subject. 'My times that I've dealt with the police I've actually received a lot of help,' he says. But in sharp contrast, a 48-year-old black man starts cursing as he addresses the topic. 'The only way we can get the police to stop chokeholding black people to death is if the police start pretending that black people are really people,' he tells viewers. Cut media which made the video, said they recruited the volunteers through friends and by posting adverts. Experience: As the men get older their perception of the police gets more negative (the man to the left, aged 36, used the word 'crisis' to describe officers while the man to the right, aged 43, used the word 'brutality' Willing participants: Cut media which made the video, said they recruited the volunteers through friends and by posting adverts . It notes that some of the men in the film actually have relatives who are officers and the piece 'isn't to pass judgement on police.' A spokesperson from the company added: 'As you watch you can see people have a lot of different experiences. 'For us, we wanted to explore how the concept of ""the police"" changes in black men as they get older. 'I think the most constructive approach to this video is to ask why the word police begins so positively and then gets progressively more negative.'

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott appears headed for another showdown with critics within his own party. It has been reported that everyone except ministers will be banned from the room when Mr Abbott leads a Cabinet meeting next week, to allow for 'gloves off' discussions about his leadership. Advisers and other staff would be asked to leave the room and there would be no recording or note taking of the discussions, Seven News reports, citing unnamed sources. The sources said Mr Abbott's leadership and the direction of the government will be discussed as favour grows for either Malcolm Turnbull or Julie Bishop to take the reins. Scroll down for video . A secret cabinet meeting to take place at 5pm on Monday is expected to discuss Prime Minister Tony Abbott's leadership and the direction of the government . However, neither Mr Turnbull, the Communications Minister, or Ms Bishop, the Foreign Minister, are giving any hint of their stance. Mr Turnbull recently told reporters 'I'll leave you guys to speculate about all that sort of stuff', while Ms Bishop said she wouldn't answer 'hypothetical questions' about running against the Prime Minister. How Mr Abbott will react to the call for a private meeting at 5pm on Monday is not known, however sources have revealed that at the last challenge to his leadership on February 9, the Prime Minster attempted to ignore the spill by skipping straight to general business discussions. Despite ministers quickly moving the discussion to Mr Abbott's performance, a vote on whether there should be a leadership contest was defeated 61 to 39 and no challenger emerged. Everyone but cabinet ministers will be demanded to leave the room for the meeting, including advisers and note takers . Senior sources claim favour continues to grow for either Malcolm Turnbull (right) or Julie Bishop (left) to take the reins, however both ministers refuse to fuel talk of another leadership challenge . On Friday Mr Abbott completely dismissed heated speculation that he will be dumped by his colleagues, when asked whether he expected to be in his job by the end of next week. 'Other people can obsess about this kind of insider gossip, but I'm certainly not going to,' he said. 'I was elected to be prime minister. The government was elected to govern the country. 'The people expect the government and the prime minister they elect to go forward doing the job that we were elected to do, and then to submit ourselves to their judgement at the next election. And that's certainly what I expect to be doing.'

Despite Mr Turnbull’s silence, he is understood to have won over many of his detractors on the front bench in a series of private dinners in recent weeks, according to political commentator David Speers. 'Over private dinners he's reached out to those nervous about putting him back into the top job, particularly those on the frontbench who until now have been loyal to Tony Abbott,' Speers wrote. 'No portfolios have been offered and no support has been directly canvassed. But Turnbull has discussed frankly the challenges confronting the Government with senior and junior ministers.'

"Pleasure: Lobacheva changed her appearance, shaved her head and started wearing military clothes, according to reports . A  woman accused of murdering a dozen homeless people has told police she felt 'sexual pleasure' from repeatedly stabbing dying victims. The shocking revelations came as Russian police questioned Elena Lobacheva, 25, about the slayings of 12 people in Moscow. She also admitted that she was inspired by a Hollywood horror movie Bride of Chucky, about a doll possessed by a serial killer. Lobachev, 25, and Paul Voitov, 20, are accused of murdering a dozen homeless people in a crusade to clean-up the city. Though they claimed to be targeting vagrants and alcoholics, and were nicknamed the 'Cleaners' gang', one victim, a bank worker, neither homeless nor a drunk, was stabbed 107 times. She told police that 'randomly stabbing the body of a dying human brought her pleasure compared to sexual pleasure', reported Life News agency. It was also alleged that on her home computer she had a 'step-by-step instruction to killing people and photos of all of her victims with their stomachs cut open and body parts cut off'. The report continued: 'The flat of the murderer was messy and filthy. There were horrible smells and personal belongings all over the flat' which she shared with a pet rabbit. She is nicknamed 'Chucky's Bride' by the Russian media, after admitting being obsessed since childhood with the 1998 movie, starring Jennifer Tilly, Brad Dourif, and Katherine Heigl. 'This movie, released over 15 years ago, became a sort of instruction for Elena. Lobacheva even has a tattoo on her shoulder - her favourite doll was always with her,' ran the Life News report. Cleaners gang: Elena Lobacheva and Paul Voitov (right) are accused of murdering a dozen homeless people in a crusade to clean-up Moscow . The alleged serial killer's mother Olga Lobacheva claimed her daughter could not have committed murder. Chucky's Bride: Lobacheva told Russian police she was inspired by the Hollywood horror movie Bride of Chucky, about a doll possessed by a serial killer, shown here tattooed on her arm . 'She can't, she's messy but she is a good person. She's supportive. She didn't kill. There is no anger in her eyes,' she said. The suspected mass murderer shared a flat with her mother and stepfather, according to some reports. Neighbours said she was 'polite and nice'. She had experimented with her appearance. Earlier she had shaved her head, and then started wearing military clothes. The pair are said to have started the killing spree in July last year, carrying out viscous knife attacks on each of the victims. It is thought they mistook bank worker Sergei Yevseyev - who was stabbed more than 100 times - as living on the streets after he stopped at a local park on his way home. Father Alexander Yevseyev, 60, said: 'My son Sergei was neither homeless nor alcoholic. He worked in a bank and had met with a friend in a local park for a chat and a drink. 'After leaving he was walking home when they attacked him, stabbing him over 107 times.' The pair were caught after they were filmed attacking a street cleaner who managed to escape. Prokhor Gorshkov, 45 had finished work and was on his way home when he was set upon by the crazed couple. He was stabbed in the back before managing to flee to a nearby police station where he gave a description of the pair. Dirty: Inside Lobacheva's filthy apartment.

"An Indianapolis police officer has been removed from a two-decade-old cold case after using a crowdsourcing website to raise funds for a DNA test that might help solve the homicide. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Detective Sgt. Bill Carter, who works in nuisance and abatement, has spent his own time since 2013 working to solve the 1993 homicide of 19-year-old Carmen Van Huss. The woman was raped and stabbed to death in her apartment on the city's north side on March 23, 1993, and two days later her body was found by her father. Carter set up a GoFundMe page on Tuesday to raise money for a $996 DNA test that would give insight into the killer's genetic profile after it was announced the fee wouldn't be covered by grant funds. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Detective Sgt. Bill Carter (pictured), who works in nuisance and abatement, has spent his own time since 2013 working on the cold case of the 1993 homicide of Carmen Van Huss . Carmen Van Huss, 19, was raped and stabbed to death in her studio apartment on March 23, 1993. Her killer has yet to be found . Though the city had originally paid for a different DNA test that cost $1,600, the Utah crime lab that processed the test returned the wrong DNA to Carter. So when he asked for funds for a second test that cost $996, he was denied and decided to crowdsource. The refusal to fund sparked a debate between the Van Huss family, who were disappointed with the lack of funding, and Maj. Chris Bailey, IMPD's assistant criminal investigations commander, who said the DNA test is not always helpful. After 32 people donated to the cause in two days, Carter had more than $1,200. He told IndyStar that he wants the excess money to be donated to Crimestoppers. When Carter couldn't get funding for a DNA test that might help narrow down the genetic makeup of the killer of Van Huss, he set up a crowdfunding site to raise money. He raised $1,200 in two days . But just hours after IndyStar published an article about the crowdfunding site, IMPD pulled Carter from the cold case. Bailey said, however, that the fundraising had nothing to do with Carter's removal and that he was taken of the case after a review of assignments and procedures. Van Huss family members are devastated that Carter has been taken off Carmen's (pictured) case. They believe without him, it will not be solved . 'We just want to make sure people stay in their lanes,' he told IndyStar. 'We have cold case investigators and we want to let them do their job.' Though Carter is not a cold case investigator, in 2011 he helped in the investigation of the 1989 death of a 16-year-old who was killed by a burglar in 1989. A year later he found the killer by matching a bloody palm print left at the scene with prints form an old misdemeanor arrest. Bailey said that without Carter investigating the Van Huss homicide, he is unsure if the DNA test will be authorized. Van Huss family members believe that without Carter on the case, it will never be solved, according to ABC 6. 'This is insane. Something has to be changed if this is how the police department is going to be run,' Jimmy Van Huss, who was 15 when his sister was killed, told ABC. He went on to tell IndyStar that Carter was the police officer that gave the family hope that the 22-year-old case would be solved. 'Ever since Bill Carter took over, we had some hope. You balance between not getting your hopes up and having hope, and he gave hope,' he said. 'If he's not assigned to the case, I have zero hope that it'll be solved, zero.' Carter said that there is no guarantee that the test would confirm the suspect's identity, but that it would 'narrow the scope down' to who they're looking for. Bailey told the IndyStar that the police department wants justice for the family, but they 'want to follow strict and tight processes'.","Detective Sgt.

"Nearly six years after the Great Recession, a clear majority of American families say they feel unprepared for a financial emergency. The Pew Charitable Trusts' poll of 7,000 U.S. households finds that 57 percent don't consider themselves ready for a sudden financial setback, 55 percent say they break even or spend more than they make each month, and a third have no savings. 'Despite a steady economic recovery, many Americans continue to feel vulnerable,' says Erin Currier, director of Pew's financial security and mobility project. A new poll found that that 57 percent of American households don't consider themselves ready for a sudden financial setback . The survey does note signs of improvement: 56 percent rate their own financial situation as positive, up from 55 percent on the eve of the recession in 2007; 27 percent give the economy a positive grade, equal to pre-recession levels. Still, 51 percent considered themselves financially secure. Predictably, those with higher incomes and more education were more likely to be confident about their finances. But even among those with annual incomes of $100,000 or more, 22 percent felt insecure, 10 percent had no savings and 12 percent reported having less than $10,000 in wealth (not including housing). Overall, 56 percent reported worrying about their finances during the previous year. Of those, 83 percent worried about lack of savings, 71 percent about covering regular expenses, 69 percent about saving for retirement. A key reason so many felt vulnerable: 82 percent of households overall reported suffering an economic shock — such as a hospital visit, the loss of a spouse or major car or house repairs — over the previous  year. Pew surveyed 7,845 households by computer from Nov. 6 to Dec. 3, 2014.","A new poll found that that 57 percent of American households don't consider themselves ready for a sudden financial setback .

"It’s a grim reality when an estimated eight million people are travelling by aeroplane every day – the person sitting next to you could die at 30,000ft. It’s the last thing you would expect to happen when you’re jetting off on holiday, but every now and then reports surface in the media about a person who died of natural causes on a domestic or international flight. It begs the question, how are cabin crew supposed to respond – specifically, what do they do with the deceased person’s body – so not to alarm other passengers, especially children, in such a sensitive situation when there is little available space on a plane? Flight attendants are trained to move a deceased passenger's body to a private area or empty row . Travellers who have been on a plane where someone has died mid-flight have told stories about the deceased being moved to an empty row in first or business class cabins, while some aircraft which are used on long-haul journeys are equipped with special compartments to keep a body out of sight. Some airlines equip their planes with body bags, just in case. Singapore Airlines’ fleet of Airbus A340-500 aircraft, which were used on all-business class flights to the US and are no longer in service, became the first to include a so-called ‘corpse cupboard’, a discreet locker large enough to store an average-sized body. While a ‘corpse cupboard’ may sound extreme, staff are trained to move a deceased passenger out of view from other travellers. Cabin crew receive first aid training, which is a mandatory part of maintaining their credentials . But that is not always possible, depending on the number of passengers on board and the size of the plane. If there is no space, cabin crew are told to cover the person with a blanket up to their neck and tighten their safety belt. If a death occurs shortly after take-off it could result in a plane returning to its airport of departure, while unscheduled landings have occurred in rare cases where a passenger died in-flight. A recent BBC2 documentary, titled A Very British Airline, revealed how British Airways trains its cabin crew to respond when a passenger dies. Finding a private area or an empty seat for a deceased passenger's body is not always possible . New recruits were told they cannot place a dead passenger in the loo because the passenger could slip off the seat and wind up on the floor. The trainer said: ‘You would have to take the aircraft apart to get that person out. Imagine putting someone in the aircraft toilet.’ A British Airways spokesman told MailOnline Travel: ‘We expect our cabin crew to treat customers who have passed away with dignity and respect. ‘This usually involves trying to move the person to an available seat in the most private area possible. ‘Our cabin crew will then focus their efforts on looking after any family, friends and travelling companions to give them privacy and support at an extremely stressful and upsetting time.’ Cabin crew will try to find a doctor on board if there is a medical emergency or a passenger who is deceased . But finding a possible area is not always possible on planes which are not configured with first or business classes. Space is at a premium on flights offered by Ryanair, Europe’s largest budget airline. A spokeswoman for the Dublin-based carrier said its planes will make an unscheduled landing if it is a medical emergency. She said: ‘All of our crews are trained in first aid. Should an incident occur in flight which requires medical intervention, our crew will ascertain whether any medically trained individuals are on board and divert to the nearest suitable airport, requesting medical assistance to be on standby before landing.’ A spokesperson for Qantas, Australia’s national airline, said deaths on its planes are ‘very rare’. The spokesperson added: ‘If a passenger passes away during flight, our cabin crew are trained to handle the situation with the utmost respect and dignity.’ If there are seats available, flight attendants will move the person's body to the first or business class cabin . Carolyn Paddock, a former commercial flight attendant who continues to fly for a private client, said an in-flight death is a ‘terrible thing’ for everyone on board. She told MailOnline Travel: ‘Each person is going to handle it differently. That said, in my experience cabin crew are incredibly tenacious and resilient people who have incredible stamina for experiencing all sorts of crazy and upsetting events and being able to move through it, carry on, and ultimately be OK.’ In many cases, the plane continues to its destination. Carolyn added: ‘It's determined case by case and it really depends where in the world you are – and how will it impact the passengers. ‘For example, are you flying over the middle of the Atlantic? A lot depends on where you are and where your destination is. ‘It may be most beneficial to continue to your destination because landing prematurely will cost the airline and passengers quite a lot of money and incur missed connections, fees, and more.’ Last December a 23-year-old woman from New Jersey died on a transatlantic flight from London to Newark Liberty International Airport, near New York. A doctor who was on board attended to the woman and tried to resuscitate her, but she was declared dead. The plane continued its journey and was met by police officers and a medical examiner when it landed in Newark. A spokeswoman for Ryanair said its planes will make an unscheduled landing if it is a medical emergency . In some cases, passengers are not allowed to disembark until authorities board the plane, inspect the body and conduct interviews. In 2007, a woman in her 70s was moved to the first class cabin from economy after she died on a British Airways flight from New Delhi to London Heathrow. One of the passengers was asleep and woke up to find cabin crew putting the woman in his row, where she was propped up using pillows in a seat next. For the next five hours, the women’s body rested in a seat next to her grieving daughter and son-in-law. Passenger Paul Trinder told The Times: ‘She kept slipping under the seatbelt and moving about with the motion of the plane. When I asked what was going on I was shocked to hear she was dead.’ Some passengers were questioned when the plane landed. Airline employees are also trained to deal with deaths involving their colleagues. Although incredibly rare, one such situation occurred in 2009 when a 60-year-old Continental Airlines pilot died from a heart attack while flying from Brussels to Newark. Two co-pilots safely landed the plane in Newark, and officials said the 247 passengers were not in danger.","Flight attendants receive special training on how to respond to a death .

"A miracle cat survived a terrifying motorway journey after it became wedged inside the engine bay of a parked car. The black cat, who has now been nicknamed Lucky, crawled inside the engine of Maria Locher's blue Mazda while it was parked at Manchester Airport for the day. Several hours later, when Ms Locher, who works at the airport, returned to the car, Lucky the cat was unable to extricate himself from his resting place and was carried for a 30-mile motorway journey at speeds of up to 60 miles-per-hour. Lucky the cat, left, climbed aboard Maria Locher's blue Mazda while it was parked at Manchester Airport . The cat worked its way into the warm engine bay of the car while it was parked at Manchester Airport . As Ms Locher approached her home in Stockport she could smell burning and when she opened up her bonnet she could hear Lucky the cat, top, meowing desperately for help . Ms Locher was travelling home at the end of the day when she noticed a burning smell as she struggled to get the car into gear. But when she pulled over and peered into the bonnet with her torch, she was amazed to hear a cat meowing for help. Ms Locher said: 'The car had been parked up all day so I have no idea when the cat crawled in there, I certainly didn't see him before I got in. 'I noticed a smell of fire coming from the bonnet and when I stopped I got a torch and looked under my bonnet - that was when I heard the meowing. I'd been driving on the motorway so I think it's amazing Lucky is still alive.' The RSCPA in Manchester is currently looking to reunite Lucky with his owner . She called the RSPCA as soon as she spotted Lucky trapped near the engine, and Inspector Steve Wickham was sent to the rescue. But Lucky had become so wedged in place that Mr Wickham could not coax him out. He decided the only way to rescue the moggy was to dismantle the car. After calling various breakdown companies, Mr Wickham was finally forced to call the fire brigade, who were able to release Lucky. Mr Wickham said: 'He was literally wedged in right at the back of the engine, and we were hoping that if we lifted the car we could just pull him out, but there wasn't enough room around the engine to grab him. 'Green Watch fire team from Stockport came out and it took about two hours to eventually set him free. 'I've since found out that Lucky did have some burns on his left hip which were operated on.' Lucky is now being cared for at the RSPCA Greater Manchester General Hospital, who are looking to reunite him with his owners. Mr Wickham added: 'He's a really friendly cat, and not what we call a feral, so if anyone recognises him call 03001238018.'

"You might think the Tesla Model S is pretty impressive as it is - but one of the world’s most popular electric cars just got a whole lot cooler. An owner of one of the vehicles has discovered a hidden ‘James Bond’ mode that allows you to turn the car into 007’s famous submersible spy car - on the dashboard at least. The Easter Egg also lets you set the ‘depth’ of the car (in leagues under the sea, of course) - although it’s probably not advisable to actually test out its sea-faring capabilities. Scroll down for video . A Youtube user has revealed a secret Easter Egg in the Tesla Model S car. The US company has included a 'James Bond' mode on the dashboard (shown). Holding the 'T' button brings up an access code window. Typing in '007' then changes the view of the car on the dashboard . The secret feature was posted to YouTube by Model S owner Josh Heffner. To activate it, users need to hold down the ‘T’ button on the main dashboard of the car. A window will then appear that asks for an access code, and by typing in zero-zero-seven, James Bond mode can be activated. Where the image of a Model S car on the dashboard normally appears, instead now the famous Lotus Espirit from the 1977 James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me is seen. The Tesla Model S dashboard, shown, allows users to select and alter different features of the car . Battery 60kwh . Power 380hp . Transmission Single speed . 0-60mph 5.9 seconds . Top speed 120mph (195km/h) Range 240 miles (385km) CO2 emissions Zero (road tax exempt) Mr Heffner explained that this was a ‘technician login’ that was ‘normally where servicing will get access to their menus and make changes.’ He admits, though, that he hasn’t ‘really found a good way to get rid of it yet’ without having to reset the dashboard. Interestingly, Tesla CEO Elon Musk actually bought the iconic Bond submarine car back in October 2013 for £560,000 ($866,000). The Lotus was nicknamed 'Wet Nellie' during filming and was built by a former Navy SEAL at a cost of around £65,000 ($100,000) - the equivalent to £325,000 ($500,000) today. Although Roger Moore starred as Bond in the film, the submarine car was driven by retired Navy Seal Don Griffin during underwater filming. There were actually several different Lotus Esprits used to film the sequence where Roger Moore and Barbara Bach escape the enemy by driving off a pier into the sea. The car that went up for sale is the only one that worked as a self-propelled submarine. The Easter Egg changes the car on the dashboard into the famous submersible Lotus Espirit from the 1977 movie The Spy Who Loved Me (pictured). And the depth - in 'leagues under the sea' - can also be selected. This is a reference to the 1870 book from French writer Jules Verne . The Tesla Model S (shown) is a full-sized electric five-door, produced by Tesla Motors. It was introduced in June 2012, and can drive 240 miles (385km) on a single charge .","A Youtube user has revealed a secret Easter Egg in the Tesla Model S car .

"A decorated New York policeman who gunned down his two daughters before turning the weapon on himself has reportedly left his wife and surviving child destitute. Glen Hochman was claimed to have submitted retirement papers just weeks before the double murder suicide and deliberately not named an inheritor for his pension. A family friend described it as a 'final insult,' according to the New York Post. 'It’s reckless and insulting for any man to leave their family high and dry like that, by choosing the zero option on their pension, the source reportedly told the newspaper. Dead: Glen Hochman, 52, a police officer of 22 years who only retired in January, is believed to have murdered his two daughters Deanna Hochman, 13 (center) and Alissa Hochman, 17, on Saturday afternoon . Family torn apart: Glen Hochman is seen here with with his wife Anamarie (back right), his two victims, daughters Alissa and Deanna (front) and eldest daughter Samantha (right). Anamarie and Samantha were not home at the time of the tragedy, police have confirmed . '...He effectively stole the future away from the family he left behind.' The 52-year-old, who served White Plains for 22 years, executed his daughters, Alissa, 17, and Deanna, 13, along with three family dogs at their home in Harrison, about 20 miles outside Manhattan. He then shot himself dead. His wife, Anamarie, 50,  and their eldest daughter, Samantha, were not at home at the time of the incident. At the time of the double murder suicide it was understood that Hochman and his wife were having marital problems. Harrison Police Chief Anthony Marraccini said officers visited the home after receiving reports of no answers at the door. Killed: Alissa Hochman, 17, a senior at Harrison High School, and Deanna Hochman, 13, were found dead, along with their father, on Saturday afternoon . Scene: Police arrived at this home at 1 Adelphi Avenue in the Westchester County village of Harrison on Saturday night to find Glen Hochman, 52, a former local cop, and his two teen daughters dead . Police dispatched to the scene made the grim discovery of the bodies and a six-page note penned by Hochman. His body was found in the garage while those of Alissa and Deanna were found on 'the main level' of the house. The family's thrree dogs had also been shot. White Plains Police Commissioner David Chong released a statement  and called the deaths 'an unfathomable tragedy'. Chong said the department were 'shocked and horrified by the news,' according to the Journal News . 'We can only pray for the family,' he said. Investigation: Police are trying to establish what drove Glen Hochman - seen here with his wife Anamarie - to murder his two daughters, before killing himself . 'Officer Hochman served this department and the city of White Plains with honor and integrity for over 22 years.' Last year, Hochman won the department's life-saving award for keeping an unresponsive man alive until paramedics arrived. Hochman suffered an Achilles' injury in early May when he fell while helping a disabled motorist, reports Lohud. He had time off to recover according to his union lawyer, Warren Roth, who had known Hochman for more than 25 years, since both worked as EMTs with the Harrison ambulance corps. He said Hochman sought a disability retirement because of the injury but had not been depressed over it as he was planning for retirement soon anyway . 'It's just devastating to a lot of people,' Roth said. 'He was always a quiet, reserved guy, nothing ever seemed to unsettle him. ... And he was wonderful with his daughters, a devoted father. That's the scary part. There was absolutely no seeing this coming.' Residents of the upper middle-class neighborhood discussed the shootings in quiet tones as they shoveled snow Sunday. Howard Hollander, 52, an airline pilot who lives five doors down from the Hochmans, said Hochman 'was always taking care of the property, landscaping, cleaning up the yard.' 'The girls said hi whenever they passed,' Hollander said. 'I remember one was learning to drive and beeped at us as she went by.' He added, 'There was no indication at all of any problem, that something like this would happen.' Murder-suicide: Investigators worked through the night on Saturday inside the home . Victims: Deanna Hochman, 13 (left), and her sister Alissa Hochman, 17, a senior at Harrison High School, were murdered by their father on Saturday, police say . Another neighbor, Dante Garritano, 52, an engineer, said he went outside when he saw ambulances and police cars Saturday. 'I walked out and I heard a woman crying, screaming, on her phone, 'My God, they're dead. He killed himself,'' Garritano said. In a statement on the Harrison school district's website, Superintendent of Schools Louis N. Wool said Alissa, a high school senior, and Deanna were 'both lost to incomprehensible tragedy.' He said the response of the district community to past tragedies has been inspiring and that he expects the students and staff will be no less resilient this time. 'In this awful moment, let us remember how proud we are of (the high school community), how much they have helped others and how much they will help others again,' Wool said.

"As a model, Olalla Oliveros appeared on billboards across Spain, but she has now swapped her glamorous life to become a nun . As a famous model, Olalla Oliveros took part in glamorous photo shoots, starred in movies, and saw her face on billboards across Spain. But she has swapped designer outfits for blue sackcloth and a veil after joining the Order of Saint Michael and becoming a nun. She made the decision after an 'earthquake' moment during a visit to The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima in Portugal. She is reluctant to talk about the decision, but told the National Catholic Register: 'The Lord is never wrong. He asked if I will follow him, and I could not refuse.' According to the site, Oliveros found the experience strange initially, but later could not shake the image of herself dressed as a nun out of her head. That vision prompted the 36-year-old to quit her job and become a nun instead, changing her name to Sister Olalla del Sí de María. Though Oliveros joined the order four years ago, she has only recently spoken about the decision. She is not the first model to swap a busy life on the catwalk for a secluded existence in cloisters. Amada Rosa Pérez was one of Colombia’s top models before becoming a nun in 2005 after becoming tired with her stressful lifetime.

"Few people can say they have laid eyes on Australia's iconic, soft and sleepy marsupials and not wanted a cuddle. But one koala-obsessed former fashion designer has taken her love for the animals a step further by promising to release a perfume that will allow you to smell like one. U.S.-born fashion blogger and critic Diane Pernet is planning a perfume inspired by the marsupials' eucalyptus scent. Diane Pernet's love of koalas has inspired her to create a perfume based on their scent - eucalyptus . The American born former fashion designer's social media pages's are scattered with koala pictures and news . The Paris-based filmmaker's love for the Australian animal is evident across her Instagram and Twitter pages which are scattered with photos, caricatures and the latest news of them. But her true dedication to koalas was revealed in an interview with Women's Wear Daily, in which she announced a fragrance including eucalyptus - the mainstay of koalas' diet - was in the works. Her plans include donating a portion of any profits made from selling the perfume to the charity to the Save The Koala. But problems have already arisen, starting with the powerful aroma of eucalyptus. 'It's far too strong, and it smells kind of like medication. It's a difficult material to work with, but I'm sure we'll arrive at something good,' Pernet said. During her last visit to Australia in September, Pernet said she got to hold a koala in Perth called Sunshine . 'I am so in love with koalas! I've always had a thing for them. Growing up, I had a friend from Sydney, and we would all have toy koalas on the end of our pencils,' she said . She described how her love for koalas reaches back to her childhood and was reinforced by her latest visit to Australia in September last year . 'I am so in love with koalas!

So I got to hold one called Sunshine, and I was so surprised by how heavy she was.' In September last year, Pernet launched her first fragrance collection made up of four scents named To Be Honest, Wanted, Shaded, and In Pursuit of Magic.

"A woman accused of force feeding her five-year-old son salt through a stomach tube reveled in the attention that a sickly child brought her, a prosecutor said on Thursday at her trial. Lacey Spears eventually killed the boy, Garnett-Paul Spears, because she feared he would start telling people she was making him ill, Assistant District Attorney Patricia Murphy suggested in closing arguments. 'The motive is bizarre, the notion is scary, but it exists ... She apparently craved the attention of her family, her friends, her co-workers and most particularly the medical profession,' she said. Relished: Lacey Spears, pictured on February 3, allegedly enjoyed her ill son's attention as she fed him salt . Spears 'created this false persona, this caring mother,' Murphy said. Blogging about life as a mother, Spears posted updates on various social media sites about her sons alleged ailments, which prosecution claims were false diagnoses. What she did to her son was 'nothing short of torture,' the prosecutor said before the New York jury began deliberating charges of depraved murder and manslaughter. Deliberations resume on Friday. Earlier, defense lawyer Stephen Riebling described Spears, of Scottsville, Kentucky, as a caring mother who was devastated by her son's death. He suggested the hospital was to blame — an assertion Murphy called 'just ridiculous' — and tried to cast doubt on the medical examiner's finding that high salt was the cause of death. The prosecution says Spears induced brain swelling by feeding Garnett heavy concentrations of sodium through a stomach tube. Jurors saw a video that showed Spears taking her son into a hospital bathroom with a connector tube and the boy suffering afterward. A feeding bag found in Spears' apartment had the equivalent of 69 McDonald's salt packets in it, a forensic toxicologist testified. The defendant, who was depicted during the trial as unemotional, wept at times as her lawyer spoke. 'She loves her son very much. She cared deeply if he lived or died,' said Riebling, who added that Spears collapsed when she learned of her child's death, and did Internet searches about how to commit suicide with insulin. Poignant: Spears is seen here with her son Garnett. Video shown in court allegedly shows her taking him from his bed to a bathroom where prosecutors say she used his stomach feeding tube to inject him with salt . Horrific: Lacey Spears wept as a court watched video last week of what prosecutors allege shows her 5-year-old son Garrett writhing and screaming in pain after she injected him with a fatal dose of salt . When edited-out scenes of the hospital video are restored, it 'paints a completely different picture' than the prosecution's, he said. Missing scenes show Spears putting two pairs of socks on Garnett. 'If she's planning on killing him, why does she care whether his feet are cold?' 'Mother of the year,' the prosecutor later said sarcastically. Hospital charts and video show a nurse failed to replace 'the necessary maintenance fluids' that were being given to Garnett to keep him hydrated during bouts of diarrhea, Riebling said, adding that a doctor testified that water loss and no replacement fluids can lead to high salt levels. Afterward, Garnett was given a rapid infusion of fluids. The makeup of the fluids is not known, but it was reasonable to conclude that it had too much sodium, he said. The fluid was changed when 'they realized he was getting a fluid high in sodium chloride,' Riebling said. 'At the very least it's reasonable doubt.' A call to a Nyack Hospital spokeswoman requesting comment was not immediately returned. Doctors testified that a child fed in an ordinary fashion would spit out that much salt. But Garnett had a feeding tube because his mother told doctors he could not keep food down otherwise. Prosecutors said Spears, who documented her son's hospital and doctor visits on social media, claimed the boy had illnesses he did not have. A friend told the jurors that after Garnett died, Spears asked her 'to go to her house and get a feeding bag in the middle of the room and throw it away and not tell anybody.' Riebling said the chain of custody couldn't be trusted and the bag could have been tampered with. Spears and her son lived in Chestnut Ridge, a suburb north of New York City, at the time of Garnett's death. Lacey Spears, an Alabama native, moved to Kentucky afterward and was living there when she was arrested.","Lacey Spears allegedly enjoyed feeding her son salt, court heard .

"Ronel Kiyanga, 20, has been jailed for a year for keeping £25,000 which an NHS cancer hospital paid to him by mistake . A 20-year-old man has been jailed for keeping almost £25,000 that an NHS cancer hospital paid into his bank account by mistake. Ronel Kiyanga decided to keep the money after it was paid to him by The Christie NHS Foundation Trust - a hospital specialising in cancer care which thought it was paying a supplier. Kiyanga was caught out when the supplier contacted The Christie to tell them that payment had not arrived in its account. The Christie was earlier emailed by someone who claimed to be from the supplier's finance department, Croydon Crown Court heard. In the email, it explained that the supplier had changed bank accounts and that future payments should be made into a new account. It is not known who sent the message. The trust made two payments in October 2012, totalling just over £24,500, into what the Trust believed was the supplier's bank account. But some time afterwards The Christie, based in Manchester, was contacted by the supplier asking for payment, with the trust realising it had been conned. Police officers discovered that the bank account the funds had been paid into belonged to Kiyanga, who was arrested in May 2013 at his flat in South Croydon, south London. When questioned about the money, he falsely claimed it was a compensation payout linked to an accident he was involved in. Kiyanga was this month found guilty of retaining wrongful credit and was jailed for a year. Investigating officer Detective Constable Rob Wevill said: 'Although we were never able to prove Kiyanga had knowledge of, or was involved in getting the NHS Trust to pay the money into his account, anyone receiving unexpected payments for this amount of money should have reported it to the bank or police. Ronel Kiyanga decided to keep the money after it was paid to him by The Christie (pictured) - a hospital specialising in cancer care which thought it was paying a supplier . Kiyanga, who lived in this block of flats in South Croydon, south London, was jailed for a year . 'Kiyanga, on the other hand, decided to go out almost immediately and spend the money, buying foreign currency and high value tech goods worth over £20,000. 'Anyone who mistakenly receives money into their account should report it to their bank immediately, however large or small the sum. 'In this case it was patently obvious that Kiyanga was not the rightful or intended recipient and he is now facing a custodial sentence for his dishonesty.' A confiscation hearing, to try to get back the missing £24,500, is due to take place at Croydon Crown Court on June 12.","Ronel Kiyanga didn't tell police when £25,000 appeared in his bank account .

"A tech-savvy high school student from New York has been arrested for allegedly hacking into a computer system to improve his exam scores.

"The RAF is sending three warplanes to help locate the Nigerian schoolgirls taken by an Islamist terror group, it has been reported. Four months ago Boko Haram, which is fighting to reinstate a medieval Islamic caliphate in religiously mixed Nigeria, abducted more than 200 schoolgirls from the village of Chibok and they remain missing. Now, three RAF Tornado GR4s outfitted with surveillance equipment are being deployed to the African nation to fly reconnaissance missions over the region the group is known to operate in. Scroll down for video . Eye in the sky: Three RAF Tornado GR4s  are being deployed to  search for the 200 missing Nigerian schoolgirls . Taken: Boko Haram abducted more than 200 schoolgirls (pictured) fom the village of Chibok four months ago . A Government source told The Times that the fighter bombers will help the Nigerian authorities by tracking the movements of Boko Haram militants. According to the report, the mission is dependent on a nearby nation giving them permission to use a runway. An MOD spokesman did not deny the report about the deployment of the planes,  adding: 'The UK continues to work with the U.S., France, Nigeria, its neighbours and international partners to provide advice and assistance to the Nigerian Government. 'Together with our allies we have provided continuous surveillance support to the Nigerian authorities, including satellite imagery. We are still in discussion with partners on the deployment of further surveillance capability.' Earlier this month suspected Islamist Boko Haram fighters have abducted dozens of boys and men from a village in northeast Nigeria, according to witnesses. After loading them onto trucks and driving them off more 97 people are now missing. Engines: Two Rolls Royce RB199 Mk103 turbofans. Thrust: 16,000lbs each. Max speed: 1.3Mach. Length: 16.72m. Max altitude: 50,000ft. Span: 8.6m. Aircrew: 2 . The RAPTOR pod, substituted in place of weaponry, is one of the most advanced reconnaissance sensors in the world and greatly increases the effectiveness of the aircraft in the reconnaissance role. Its introduction into service gave the GR4 the ability to transmit real-time, Long Range Oblique Photography (LOROP) to commanders or to view this in cockpit during a mission. The stand-off range of the sensors also allows the aircraft to remain outside heavily defended areas, thus minimising the aircraft’s exposure to enemy air-defence systems. Source: RAF . Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau in a video he sent taunting the Nigerian government over the kidnapping of the girls from their boarding school dormitory in April . Several witnesses who fled after the raid on Doron Baga, a sandy fishing village near the shores of Lake Chad, said militants clothed in military and police uniforms had burned several houses. 'They left no men or boys in the place; only young children, girls and women,' said Halima Adamu, sobbing softly and looking exhausted after a 110 mile road trip on the back of a truck to Maiduguri, capital of the northeastern state of Borno. 'They were shouting 'Allah Akbar' (God is greatest), shooting sporadically. There was confusion everywhere. 'They started parking our men and boys into their vehicles, threatening to shoot whoever disobey them. Everybody was scared.' Firefighters and rescuers extinguish a fire at the scene of a bomb blast at Terminus market in the central city of Jos, Nigeria. Twin car bombings attributed to Boko Haram Islamists in May killed at least 46 people . They said six older men were also killed in Sunday's raid, while another five people were wounded. Boko Haram, seen as the number one security threat to Africa's top economy and oil producer, has dramatically increased attacks on civilians in the past year, and the once-grassroots movement has rapidly lost popular support as it gets more bloodthirsty. Its solution - kidnapping boys and forcing them to fight and abducting girls as sex slaves - is a chilling echo of Ugandan rebel Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army, which has operated in the same way in Uganda, South Sudan and central Africa for decades. The kidnappers overpowered local vigilantes who had no support because this is no military presence there, the villagers said. Talatu Abubakar, another villager who fled to Maiduguri, said the invaders had taunted the men for being unable to defend themselves. Plight: A woman attends a demonstration in Lagos, Nigeria, in May urging the government to increase efforts to rescue the hundreds of abducted students from a secondary school . 'They were shouting 'Where is your pride? You people used to be warriors. Today you are all just women, not as brave as we thought',' he said. He said that from his Hadeija clan alone, some 47 people were missing and feared to have been abducted. The raid shows how mobile Boko Haram units can be. After a military offensive in May last year broke their hold on the area around Lake Chad in the far northeast of Borno state, the rebels relocated to the south of the state, near the Cameroon border nearly 300 km (190 miles) away. Chibok, where the girls were taken from, is in this area. Their re-appearance in the area demonstrates their ability to move across vast swathes of northeastern Nigeria without being intercepted by the military. Nigerian forces are overstretched against a determined foe. In the past week they have fought gun battles with Boko Haram Islamists in two key towns in the south of Borno - Gwoza, the security sources said, and the garrison town of Damboa, which the militants sacked a month ago.","Planes will fly reconnaissance missions over Nigeria, it has been reported .

"A new life insurance policy is set to cover every eventuality...including being exterminated by Daleks, crushed by a Transformer or killed in a 'Sharknado'! Virgin Money will also pay out in the unfortunate event of being killed by Martian death rays or eaten by the Loch Ness monsters. And in a nod to Ghostbusters, being crushed by a giant man made of marshmallow is covered too in the bizarre list of acceptable causes of death by the insurer. Virgin Money is offering its customers the opportunity to insure themselves against death by Dalek . But wacky as they are, there is a serious point, says the financial giant, as they hope it highlights just how little people take life insurance seriously in the first place. Virgin say they WILL pay out if you are killed by a shark whipped from the sea by a tornado and then deposited in the middle of the city, like B-movie horror film Sharknado. But they hope it will encourage people to realise that while this is unlikely to happen, real chances of accidental death are far more likely than many realise. The ten wacky ways to die are familiar to film and TV fans as they take their inspiration from scifi like Dr Who and Godzilla to Harry Potter and even Jack and the Beanstalk. However, Virgin would like to point out that falling from the beanstalk itself is not covered because of the risks involved in taking on the task invalidates the policy! Virgin will pay out if a shark is taken from the sea by a tornado and kills you in the middle of the street . Virgin Money director Darrell Evans said: 'This is a light-hearted attempt to highlight the importance of life insurance. 'What's odd, though, is that our sense of risk is a bit skewed. 'In life we spend too much time imagining the things that will never happen. 'Maybe we should spend a little bit more time thinking about and planning for what eventually will happen. 'For example, around 30 million lottery tickets are sold in the UK every Saturday to hopeful people thinking that they might just win. 'The odds are in fact higher that they could meet an unfortunate end on the way to buying a ticket than they are to win the jackpot.' A poll of 16,000 British adults recently found only 23 per cent have a life insurance policy, falling to just 15 per cent in London though rising to 31 per cent in Northern Ireland. Darrell Evans added: 'Essentially what this tells us is that if Londoners got caught up in a row between Thor and Dark Elf Malekith over his plans to destroy the universe and restore the Dark Elves to dominance by unleashing the Aether at the centre of the Convergence in Greenwich, fewer than two in ten adults would have appropriate cover. 'But more seriously, while it can be a difficult thing to think about, having life insurance in place is an important part of financial planning.'","Virgin Money is offering customers insurance cover against freak events .

Going by the name Hwy 190, the fan wrote on a U2 message board: 'I’ve been visiting U2’s Joshua Tree in the California desert for nearly 20 years now the Mojave is my home. 'This past Sunday, I made my proverbial yearly hike out to the Tree with my dog to reminisce only to find that some hack and I do mean hack, decided it was a bright idea to take a hacksaw to one of the Tree’s limbs - evidently to remove an inch thick cross section as a souvenir. 'I won’t even elaborate as to how pathetic this is. Let’s just say It was a good thing I didn’t happen upon this ignorant low-life degenerate in his course of action. 'In short, leave the damn Tree alone, so that future fans can enjoy it. Left alone, the Tree will be there for many, many decades to come.' It stood in the Mojave Desert of California and was picked by the band to represent their American experience . Collapsed: Although it fell in 2000, many fans still pilgrimage to the site . Tributes: Signs adorn the tree. The fan who discovered the vandalism believes somebody took a piece home . The image of the tree was shot by photographer Anton Corbijn, who traveled with the band for three days in December 1986 trying to find the right spot for a photo. The album was designed to represent their band's experience of America. It is billed as the record that sealed their worldwide success, with record-breaking sales across the world. Some of their best-selling songs were featured on the album, including With Or Without You, and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For. The group landed Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Group Rock Performance that year.","Fan trekked to the tree in Mojave Desert on Sunday, it is missing a limb .

"Japanese police on Friday arrested three teenagers on suspicion of killing a 13-year-old schoolboy, in a chilling murder some local media suggested was inspired by Isis executions such as those by Jihadi John. The brutalised and naked body of Ryota Uemura was found in undergrowth near a river last Friday. His neck had been repeatedly hacked at, apparently with a knife, discovered nearby soaked in blood. Low-crime Japan has been captivated by the killing, with media reporting every twist and turn in the investigation, including details of how the youngster's mobile phone was used to send a friend request on a messaging app around the time of his death. Japanese children pray for their friend Ryota Uemura at the site where his body was found in suburban Tokyo, on February 24, 2015 . Populist weekly Shukan Shincho reported the wounds appeared to indicate that whoever killed Ryota may have been trying to decapitate him. 'Some investigators suspect (the criminals) watched Internet videos showing the execution of hostages by Islamic State (IS) fighters and sought to mimic them,' the magazine said, quoting an unnamed source close to police. Japan is still reeling from the brutal murder of two of its citizens - war correspondent Kenji Goto and his friend Haruna Yukawa - by Isis fanatics in Syria. Kanagawa Police Department on Friday arrested an 18-year-old boy and two 17-year-olds, whose names were withheld because they are legally minors, on suspicion of murder, public broadcaster NHK and other media reported. Investigators in Japan believe that the murderers may have been copying Isis execution videos such as those featuring the fanatical butcher 'Jihadi John' (pictured), who was named as Mohammed Emwazi . While a police spokesman declined to confirm the reports, investigators also obtained arrest warrants for two other teenagers over the murder in Kawasaki, an industrial city southwest of Tokyo, media said. Junior high school student Ryota reportedly knew the suspects, and had been attacked by them previously, media said. Violent crime is exceedingly rare in Japan and becomes very big news when it occurs.","Brutalised and naked body of Ryota Uemura found in undergrowth .

"A never-seen-before archive of evidence compiled by Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle when he turned sleuth to solve a real-life mystery has emerged for sale for £40,000. Conan Doyle followed in the footsteps of his most famous creation Dr Holmes when in 1906 he began investigating the peculiar case of George Edalji. The fascinating story, portrayed in the 2005 Julian Barnes novel Arthur and George, is set to hit television screens on Monday night, with Martin Clunes starring as Conan Doyle in the ITV drama. Iconic writer: A 1922 picture of English author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who created Sherlock Holmes . The tale starts as George Edalji, a solicitor from Birmingham, is handed seven years' hard labour in 1903 after being found guilty of a series of mutilation attacks horses around the rural village of Great Wyrley, Staffs, where his father was the vicar. Edalji, aged 27 at the time, had been accused of wounding the horses under the cover of darkness then writing threatening anonymous letters to police, charges he always contested. His conviction caused public outrage with more than 10,000 people, including criminal lawyers, protesting it. Among the most high profile supporters of the protest was Conan Doyle, who at the time was among the most celebrated writers in the country. Conan Doyle became convinced that Edalji was innocent after meeting in him in a hotel lobby in 1906 on his release from prison. Noticing how bad Edalji's eyesight was, he concluded it would have been impossible for someone with such poor vision to carry out the crimes at night. Wrongfully convicted: A mugshot of George Edalji, who was wrongly convicted in October 1903 of wounding a pony, the eighth of a series of horse mutilations in the farming and mining county of Staffordshire . In a style akin to his most famous character, Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle set about logically compiling reams of evidence in a bid to disprove Edalji's guilt and see him pardoned. The writer became more and more obsessed with the case, bombarding Staffordshire police chief Captain George Anson with daily letters putting forward evidence he had gathered from crime scenes and from forensics experts. Conan Doyle, a doctor before taking up writing, also offered his advice to experts in the case. In one letter to the veterinary surgeon who had examined the mutilated horses Conan Doyle suggested he 'examine the wounds upon the horses from the point of view that they are caused by a very large horse-lancet... The invariable long wound suggests an instrument which cannot stab, having a blount [sic] end'. The legendary author, who invented Sherlock Holmes 1887, offered his own list of suspects, eventually pointing the finger at villager Royden Sharp, and suggested witnesses who should be interviewed by police to back up his findings. Conan Doyle's letters: The author bombarded Staffordshire police chief Captain George Anson with daily letters putting forward evidence he had gathered from crime scenes and from forensics experts . In a letter to Capt Anson suggesting he investigate Sharp, Conan Doyle wrote: 'I am convinced he was concerned in some of the earlier outrages... [he is] fiendishly cunning.' He added: 'Colour prejudice may have been enough to prompt them [the Sharp brothers] to bait the Edalji family in the cruel way they did... The man's own relatives admit that he has times of dangerous mania.' The writer's efforts in clearing Edalji's name were depicted in a 2005 novel by English author Julian Barnes. The book was turned into a television series, with Martin Clunes playing Arthur Conan Doyle and Arsher Ali playing Edalji - set to be aired on Monday. In May 1907 as direct result of Conan Doyle's work an inquiry into the case was opened and concluded with Edalji being officially pardoned. TV drama: Martin Clunes is set to play Arthur Conan Doyle in an ITV drama based on the author's quest to clear George Edalji's name . Capt Anson however remained convinced of Edalji's guilt and refused to investigate any other leads, including looking into Royden Sharp. In sheer frustration, Conan Doyle wrote: 'I never thought my Case...was good enough for a prosecution... [but]...to say that there is 'absolutely nothing' against a man who exhibited a weapon and said it was the sort of one which did the outrages is a statement which makes me feel rather hopeless about the use of getting evidence. I wonder what would be something if that is nothing'. Although he helped secure a pardon for Edalji, Conan Doyle failed in his bid to get financial compensation paid, which he said was 'to the deep disgrace of British Administration'. The correspondence between Conan Doyle and Capt Anson continued until 1911, becoming more and more hostile as the years went by. In the final exchange, Conan Doyle wrote 'your letter is a series of inaccuracies mixed up with a good deal of rudeness'. Notes written by Anson at the same time asked 'Is C.D. mad?' and stated 'this matter is a personal one between Sir A. Conan Doyle and myself'. In a police memo on the case Anson wrote: 'It was on 'evidence' and 'proof' such as he obtained in the above instance that the great Sherlock Holmes based his accusations...'. In a curious appendix to his printed report published in 1920 marked Confidential, Anson admits to fabricating evidence for Conan Doyle to chase, designed to discredit him and his methods. It reveals he created an elaborate ruse involving Royden Sharp appearing to travel to London to deliver a poison-pen letter to Conan Doyle. Experts think the archive of 30 handwritten letters, none of which has ever been published, once belonged to Anson and was passed on following his death in 1947. Also included in the archive are notes kept by Anson during the case, police reports from the investigation, witness statements, press cuttings and even a police mugshot of Edalji. The collection will be sold on behalf of a private collector by London auctioneers Bonhams. The sale coincides with the start of a three-part series Arthur and George, starring Martin Clunes, based on Julian Barnes' 2005 book of the same name following the story of Conan Doyle and Anson. Airing on Monday: Martin Clunes (left) as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Arsher Ali as George Edalji in ITV drama Arthur and George, based on the book by Julian Barnes . Sarah Lindberg, head of manuscripts at Bonhams, said: 'This is the first time these letters have ever been seen before and they give a fascinating insight into the lengths Conan Doyle went to to prove Edalji's innocence. 'He saw himself as the champion of justice and after meeting Edalji he set about trying to prove his innocence with the same logical and forensic approach Sherlock Holmes was known for. 'Conan Doyle was so incredibly committed to the case and that comes across in his letters, which he wrote daily and in great detail. 'The majority of the letters are to Captain Anson, the Staffordshire police chief, in a bid to get him to change his mind about the guilt of Edalji. 'Conan Doyle actually went to the crime scenes and gathered evidence himself, which Anson took exception to because he saw it as undermining the police's own work. 'The letters offer a view of the fractious relationship between Conan Doyle and Anson which has not been seen to this extent before. 'Both men were convinced they were right and neither would back down. By the end of the correspondence it is clear they had both lost patience with one another. 'To have such a large collection of handwritten, autographed letters in one collection is very rare. It is likely the archive was compiled by Anson and passed on. 'It is now being sold by a private collector who inherited it from a friend who had connections to the Staffordshire area. 'As soon as this collection came in I knew it was something very special. 'We are expecting a lot of interest from collectors of Arthur Conan Doyle memorabilia and fans of Sherlock Holmes - both have a huge international appeal.' The auction will be held at Bonhams' Knightsbridge saleroom on March 18.","George Edalji wrongfully convicted of horse mutilations in Staffordshire .

"One year on from when Danica Weeks lost the love of her life, none of her yearning questions have yet been answered. Ms Weeks and her two sons are among the grieving family members who lost loved ones in the tragic and baffling disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. In a candid interview  airing this Tuesday on SBS Dateline, the mother tells of her families gruelling year without their devoted husband and father Paul Weeks. Scroll down for video . In a candid interview airing next week on Dateline, 40-year-old Danica Weeks describes the agony of losing the love of her life on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . Paul Weeks (pictured) boarded the routine passenger flight on March 8, 2014. Mrs Weeks has revealed  the agony of constantly wondering what happened to him . On March 8, 2014, 39-year-old Paul Weeks boarded seat 1C, business class, on the routine passenger flight which departed from Kuala Lumpur and was bound for Beijing. The 40-year-old-mother will describe the agony of constantly wondering what happened to him on the program. She's frustrated with Malaysian authorities, claiming they've simply refused to answer her questions. 'They just won't tell us. I can only hope we get something, anything,' she says while fighting back tears in a trailer for the program. 'They are wanting to put this aside. In their own words - to move beyond MH370. How do you move? We don't get to move beyond! We will never get to move beyond. So how can they just move beyond this and forget about it?' The program will also tracks the developments, false alarms and disappointments in the year-long hunt for MH370 through Mrs Weeks's eyes. Despite the most expensive search and rescue operation in history, not a single trace of the plane, or its passengers and crew has been found. Ms Weeks was left with the harrowing task of explaining to her two sons what happened to their father . Danica Weeks still can't fathom how Malaysia Flight 370 disappeared and took away her husband on March 8 . Paul Weeks is among the 239 lost souls on the MH370 aircraft, which still remains missing . In an interview with The Weekend Australian in September, the 40-year-old says her life stopped the moment she was informed that her 39-year-old husband was among the 239 lost souls when Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 crashed into a remote area of the southern Indian Ocean. This wasn't part of their grand plan - of moving to Perth, leading a simple family life and most importantly growing old together. The couple first met 14 years ago at Oktoberfest in Munich. From then on, romance blossomed and they pair lived together in London  until they relocated to Christchurch in New Zealand - Mr Weeks' hometown. But following the earthquakes, they decided to make the move to Perth in 2011 where they wanted to settle down and raise their two kids. On March 8, Mr Weeks boarded MH370 so he could make his way to Mongolia to start his new fly-in-fly-out job as a mechanical engineer. His precious final moments are ingrained in Mrs Weeks' memories, as she revealed that her husband gave her his watch and wedding ring amid concerns that something may happen to him at the mining site. He requested the wedding ring was to go to the first son who gets married and the watch to the second. But for now, Mrs Weeks keeps the ring close to her heart by wearing it around her neck. 'Every night now I go home and it's lonely, it's very lonely. When you've had someone there for 14 years, how do you keep going when they're gone?' The mother-of-two with her boys Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 1 at their Perth home . While Mrs Weeks herself isn't able to put piece the puzzle together herself, she was left with the harrowing task of explaining to her two sons what happened to their father. For eldest son Lincoln, who's understood that his daddy has gone to work forever, he's left anxious that the same will happen to his mother. 'That's why I won't rest until I find out what happened to Pauly. That's why I won't let [Malaysia Airlines] treat him like a seat number. I have to keep him alive. And I won't rest until we find out what happened to him and to everyone else on that plane,' she said. As for the second devastating Malaysia Airlines disaster, where a plane flying over the Russian-Ukraine conflict was shot down on July 17 and claimed 298 lives, the pain of loss and bewilderment hit too close to home for Mrs Week. 'Just feel so heart broken, all over again, for all the families of MH17,' she wrote on her Facebook. The 39-year-old mechanical engineer, from New Zealand, was a dedicated father to his two sons . On board the missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 were 12 crew members and 227 passengers . Meanwhile, the search continues for the doomed Boeing 777 as air crash investigators hope to further narrow down the planned search area to find the aircraft within the next year. The plane vanished with 12 crew members and 227 passengers on board after it departed Kuala Lumpar in Malaysia to Beijing in China. Upon several failed aerial searches to spot any wreckage from the airliner,experts have studied radar and satellite data in a bid to close in on the crash site. Dateline: Where's Dad?

"A drug addicted mother gave her baby a heroin substitute to 'knock him out' so she could take crack cocaine 'in peace', a court has heard. Kelly Emery, 34, of Frankley, Worcestershire, was charged with manslaughter after her son Fenton Hogan died of a methadone overdose on July 1, 2013. Emery denies giving the two-year-old the heroin substitute to make him sleep and is currently on trial at Nottingham Crown Court. Kelly Emery (pictured left) has been charged with manslaughter after her baby Fenton Hogan (right) died of a methadone overdose in 2013. The prosecution claim she gave him the drug so she could take crack in 'peace' On the second day of her trial jurors heard the baby was 'energetic and happy' right up until his death. But his grandmother Angela Emery, Kelly Emery's mother, told the court her daughter 'cared more about drugs than her children'. When she was asked how her daughter funded her habit in the months before Fenton's death, Mrs Emery said: 'Selling herself, basically. 'She would phone [me] regularly for money - she would claim it was for gas, electricity or food.' Mrs Emery said her daughter had been addicted to drugs since the age of 17. She said it was clear from her daughter's home and her appearance that she was an addict. Mrs Emery told the court the house was mess and her daughter was 'not bothered' about housework or ensuring the children had clean clothes. She added Emery began developing scabs on her face and arms . In the months before his death the court heard Emery had been referred to Birmingham Social Services. Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) heard Emery cared 'more about drugs than she did about her children' However, Mrs Emery said she did not share her concerns with social workers because past referrals had led nowhere. Following his death Mrs Emery told police Fenton and his older sister, then 12, were an 'inconvenience' to Emery. But she added she did not think her daughter had wanted Fenton to die. Fenton's paternal grandmother Lynn Wheeldon also gave evidence. She took care of the baby the day before his death. She said he was happy when she returned him home on Sunday, June 30, 2013. She said the previous week he had spent time with his older cousins. She told the court: 'He enjoyed his day with us. He was happy, bubbly, it was a lovely warm day.' A post-mortem examination revealed Fenton had ingested methadone at least twice before his death . Emery has pleaded guilty to causing Fenton's death by gross negligence but denies charges of manslaughter and cruelty. Christopher Hotten QC, prosecuting, alleged Emery deliberately gave the toddler methadone in order to 'knock him out' so she could take crack cocaine in peace. The trial continues.

"With his big blue eyes and beautiful grin, Dexter Cook was his parents’ pride and joy. But tragedy was to strike just weeks after the infant’s first birthday when his devastated mother and father found him dead in his cot. Desperate to know why Dexter had been a victim of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), parents James Cook, 37, and Gemma Littley, 33, volunteered his DNA for a pioneering genetic test. And in what could be a significant breakthrough for other families, medics discovered a rare gene mutation that causes the heart to beat irregularly. The findings will now be investigated in depth to try and unlock the mystery surrounding the sudden deaths of almost 300 UK babies each year. Gemma and James Cook, 33 and 37, were distraught when their one-year-old son Dexter passed away unexpectedly last year . Doctors told Mr and Mrs Cook Dexter had died of sudden infant death syndrome - the name given to unexplained baby deaths, or cot death . Mrs Cook went to check on her son at 8:45pm on May 30 last year and found him unresponsive. He was rushed to hospital but was found dead on arrival . Doctors warn that the discovery may not herald the arrival of an overall ‘gene for cot death’, but could provide an explanation in some cases. Mr Cook, a director of a recycling firm, said it was vital that they found out exactly why Dexter died. ‘Cot death is a term used to describe what happened, but not a reason why,’ he said. ‘If what the doctors have discovered from Dexter can help just one other family understand why their baby died then it will be fantastic – part of his legacy.’ An inquest this week in Heywood, Greater Manchester, was told how Miss Littley found 13-month-old Dexter not breathing when she checked on him in bed in May last year. Desperate to find out how their son died, Mr and Mrs Cook entered his DNA into an NHS test, which revealed he had a genetic heart condition never seen before in a child. He is pictured on holiday with his mother . Mr Cook says the inquest - which ruled Dexter died from natural causes - gave him and his wife 'closure'. He said: 'It was such a relief to finally get an answer' Despite a neighbour’s attempts to resuscitate the tot, he was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. A post-mortem examination failed to provide an explanation, so the couple agreed to specialist genetic testing that has only been available on the NHS for around 12 months. Dr Kay Metcalfe, a consultant geneticist at St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester, discovered that Dexter had a mutation in one of his genes – SCN3B – seen in just a handful of previous cases. Parents suffer the agony of about 270 sudden or unexplained infant deaths in the UK each year. The majority – eight out of ten – occur before babies reach one year old. According to recent statistics boys are most at risk, accounting for almost two thirds of cases in 2012. The rate is also three times higher among lower birth weight babies. However, deaths have fallen by around 65 per cent since the launch of a campaign in the early 1990s that included advice such as making sure babies sleep on their backs and warning against sharing a bed with a newborn, especially if parents are smokers or had been drinking. The exact cause is largely unknown, although researchers in Australia last year established a link to breathing problems. A study in Norway found brain ‘swelling’ in some cases. Defects can lead to an irregular heartbeat known as known as arrhythmia and in some cases it is fatal. Dr Metcalfe told the hearing the finding was a ‘significant breakthrough’ for Dexter’s family. But she warned it may not be ‘the answer for everyone’ because lifestyle factors were also important. Coroner Lisa Hashmi recorded a verdict of natural causes. Mr Cook said: 'It was such a relief to finally get an answer. 'You get through the day protecting your child from sticking their fingers in plug sockets and eating things they shouldn't and then you put them in what should be the safest place - bed. 'I was worried that Dexter's death would be ruled as unascertained or cot death and that is unacceptable to me. 'Since Dexter's death, we have been wondering if we did anything wrong. 'But we knew in our heart of hearts that there is nothing we could have done, even if we were trained doctors. 'The inquest has brought closure and helped us to realise that we did nothing wrong.' Mrs Cook, a full-time mother, added: 'It was definitely the outcome that we wanted.' Dexter's death could help shed light on the causes of cot death, which kills 600,000 babies a year in the UK, experts said. His parents have set up a charity in his name . The court heard that Dexter was found unresponsive at 8.45pm on May 30 last year after Mrs Cook went to check on him in his cot an hour and a half after putting him to sleep. Area Coroner for Manchester North, Lisa Hashmi, said: 'Dexter appeared to be fine in the morning though a bit jumpy. It was not felt that there was anything particularly alarming.' That evening he was given a bath and was put to bed where he seemed to settle. Ms Hashmi added: 'At about 8.45pm it was quite quiet and Gemma went to check on him and realised he was not breathing. She felt there were no apparent signs of life so she put him back into the cot and contacted neighbours.' A neighbour carried out resuscitation while Dexter's distraught parents waited for paramedics to arrive. Dexter was rushed to Royal Oldham Hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival. The court heard that although he needed an operation for a large hernia, he had otherwise been a happy, healthy baby with very loving parents. A post-mortem examination was carried out but no cause of death could be ascertained, so further specialised tests were carried out including to see if there were any bacterial or viral infections present in Dexter's body. These also drew a blank, as did biochemistry and toxicology tests. Sudden infant death syndrome - or cot death - is the term used to describe the unexpected death of a baby or toddler that is initially unexplained. The paediatrician on call the night Dexter died suggested they could send him for a molecular autopsy – a DNA test for genes related to heart disease that is sometimes carried out after unexplained deaths. So scientists arranged for the test to be carried out at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester. Mr Cook said he hoped Dexter's case could help others. He said: 'I hope that one day he will help provide answers to other families who find themselves in this awful situation' It was there that doctors discovered Dexter had the mutation in the SCN3B gene. This type of mutation is often associated with abnormal heart rhythms, which could have caused Dexter's death. Dr Kay Metcalfe, clinical consultant geneticist at the hospital, who discovered the crucial change in Dexter's genes, said: 'It is a significant breakthrough for that family. 'The study into that gene has added to the knowledge that we have already gained. 'However there are variations in each person so it is not necessarily the answer for everyone.' She added: 'This was found more likely to occur at night and with a fever which is what features here. It is quite likely to be relevant to Dexter's death.' Coroner Ms Hashmi said: 'He had a genetic deficiency that brought about an abnormal heart rhythm and that's why Dexter died. 'From the evidence that fits very well with the clinical picture. This kind of investigation is in its infancy and there is still a great deal of research to be done but what Dr Metcalfe was able to say was that overall cause of death was natural. 'I would not normally accept cardiac arrhythmia as cause of death but I am minded to accept that explanation because everything else has been ruled out.' Sudden infant death syndrome describes the unexpected death of a baby or toddler that is initially unexplained. Cot death was a term commonly used in the past. It has largely been abandoned, due to misleading suggestions that sudden infant death can only occur when a baby is asleep in a cot. Causes of SIDS may include accidents, infections, congenital abnormality or metabolic disorder. For those deaths that remain unexplained, experts believe there are likely to be undiscovered causes. SIDS statistics: . Source: The Lullaby Trust and Office for National Statistics . Her conclusion was that death was from natural causes. She added: 'None of us expect it to happen and it is every parent's nightmare.' Afterwards, Mr Cook thanked all the doctors, paramedics and police officers who had helped them during the tragedy. He said Dexter had 'brought pure joy to everybody'. Mrs Cook is now 32 weeks pregnant, but faces an agonising wait to see if the new baby has the same mutated gene that killed Dexter. There is a 50 per cent chance that the child will have the same mutation but – as the test cannot be carried out while the baby is still developing - the couple will not find out until birth. Mr Cook said: 'If we discover that the baby does have the condition we can treat it with medication or surgery to fit a defibrillator. 'The science behind it all is exciting but very much in its infancy. 'Around 600 babies die every year from cot death and it's far too many so I hope we can help prevent that with our findings. 'Even after Dexter's death, my sense of pride has just got stronger and I hope that one day he will help provide answers to other families who find themselves in this awful situation.' Mr and Mrs Cook have launched a small charity in their son's name, Dexter's Light, to raise £15,000 for sensory equipment that stimulates children's senses.","Dexter Cook died in his sleep last year, shorty after his first birthday .

"A 50-year-old shopper was asked for ID when he tried to buy a £2.60 bag of mixed nuts and a pair of bananas from Tesco. Tony Morris fancied a snack as he made his way home from dinner on Tuesday night, so popped into his local supermarket in Carlton Hill, Nottingham. But the peckish housing association manager was shocked and 'embarrassed' when the self-service checkout warned the salted mixed nuts were an age-restricted product. Nutty: Tony Morris was asked for ID when he tried to buy a £2.60 bag of mixed nuts and a pair of bananas from Tesco . The peckish housing association manager was shocked and 'embarrassed' when the self-service checkout warned the salted mixed nuts were an age-restricted product . A security guard and a Tesco worker approached Mr Morris after the 'ID required' message - usually reserved for alcohol, age-rated DVDs and painkillers - appeared on the screen. Mr Morris said: 'I'd been out for a meal and fancied a snack because there were small portions. 'I grabbed some nuts and a couple of bananas. I put the bananas through the self service checkout and then the nuts. That's when the red  lights came on and blue ones started flashing too. There was a message on the screen saying 'Age verification required'. 'I wasn't a happy bunny when they said I needed ID. A security guard and a member of staff came over.' 'I stood at the machine wondering what I had done wrong to attract so much attention and staring. I said I wasn't even buying alcohol, and was told that it sometimes goes off for alcohol-related products, but I'm still not sure what these could have been. Mr Morris, who said he needed the healthy snack because he is diabetic, added: 'Although staff laughed it off, it is embarrassing when you are highlighted for doing nothing wrong. Do I need to take my passport and driving licence to purchase my breakfast? A security guard approached Mr Morris after the 'ID required' message - usually reserved for alcohol, age-rated DVDs and painkillers - appeared on the screen at the supermarket (pictured) in Nottingham . 'They let me go but it was embarrassing as everyone was looking at me.' The shopper, who paid £2.60 for the mixture of Brazil nuts, cashews, almonds, hazelnuts and pecans, as well as 29p for the pair of bananas, said he did not know if he would return to the store after the incident. A Tesco spokeswoman said: 'We don't age restrict the sale of nuts - our store team have rechecked all the nuts in the store to ensure this is the case. 'Giving customers great service is our number one priority and we're sorry if the incident caused our customer any inconvenience.'

"The Republican-controlled House has passed a one-week funding extension for Homeland Security after the majority refused to pass the legislation just hours before the deadline. Lawmakers were thrown into a race against time on Friday night when 52 Republicans defected on the leadership-backed legislation. The vote was 224-203 against the measure. Two hours before the midnight deadline, the House voted 357 to 60 to fund the department for another week. A combination of conservative, tea party-backed Republicans on one side of the political aisle and Democrats on the other opposed the bill. The first group was upset because the legislation had been stripped of changes to President Barack Obama's immigration policy, and the second because it lacked full-year funding for the sprawling department. Scroll down for video . Race against time: The House has until midnight to approve funding for Homeland Security after it was blocked . With less than seven few hours remaining before the midnight deadline, it was unclear what Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders would next propose. Democrats led by Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California urged them in advance to allow a vote on a bill to keep the department in funds through the Sept. 30 end of the budget year - a step the GOP high command had previously refused to take. 'You have made a mess,' Pelosi said to Republicans as debate neared an end on the measure. That wasn't how tea party-backed rebels saw it. 'It does not make any difference whether the funding is for three weeks, three months or a full fiscal year. If it's illegal, it's illegal,' said Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala. Other conservatives disagreed with that sort of analysis in large numbers - and said so. 'It's the best solution that we have available to us right now,' said Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark. 'Nobody wants to shut down the Department of Homeland Security.' Across the Capitol, the Senate waited to add its assent after playing out a series of acts in the Republicans' effort to use the measure to wring concessions on immigration from the White House. A largely symbolic attempt to advance legislation that would repeal Obama's immigration directive of last fall failed on a vote of 57-42, three short of the 60 required. That separate proposal was 'commonsense legislation that would protect our democracy from the egregious example of executive overreach we saw in November,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who successfully led his rank and file in recent days to a decision to pass Homeland Security legislation without immigration-related provisions. Much of the Department of Homeland Security was to remain open, even if funding expired at midnight. Airport security checkpoints would remain staffed, immigration agents would be on the job, air marshals would do their work and Coast Guard patrols would sail on. Defected:  Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called on speaker John Boehner to approve full-year funding . Of the department's 230,000 employees, an estimated 200,000 would remain at work, either because they are deemed essential, or because their pay comes from fees that are unaffected by congressional spending disputes. And ironically, a federal court order has blocked implementation of Obama's immigration policies that most Republicans seek, at least temporarily. Taken together, the day's events at the Capitol underscored the difficulty Republicans have had so far this year in translating last fall's election gains into legislative accomplishment - a step its own leaders say is necessary to establish the party's credentials as a responsible, governing party. Republicans gained control of the Senate in last November's balloting, and emerged with their largest House majority in more than 70 years. Further demonstrating GOP woes, House GOP leaders abruptly called off a vote on a major education bill that had attracted significant opposition from conservatives as well as Democrats and the White House. Aides attributed that decision to the need to work separately on rounding up enough votes to pass the measure that would prevent a partial shutdown at Homeland Security. The day's developments occurred against a midnight deadline for funding the department, an agency with significant responsibilities in the nation's fight against terrorism. An early, 240-183 test vote in the House indicated ample support for the spending bill, but a short while later the House was gaveled into recess while the search went on for support to pass the legislation itself. 'The House must pass this bill in short order to keep the lights on at the Department of Homeland Security in the near term,' said Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky. 'Hopefully, this will buy us this additional time that we clearly need.' Democrats argued against the measure, saying their preference was a longer-term bill to provide funding that carries the department trough the Dept. 30 end of the budget year without attempting to alter immigration policy. It cleared the Senate Friday on a vote of 68-31. 'Give us a vote, Mr. Speaker. Give us a vote. Instead, drip, drip, drip,' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader. Some House Republicans agreed, noting that Senate Democrats had demonstrated their ability to block any challenges to Obama's immigration policies, and that the president had vowed to veto them in any event. 'The only question is when - tomorrow or in three weeks,' said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa. 'Some folks just have a harder time facing political reality than others.' Obama's first immigration directive, in 2012, lifted the threat of deportation from many immigrants brought to the country illegally as youngsters. Another order last fall applied to millions more who are in the United States unlawfully.","Republican-backed House rejected legislation 224-203 on Friday .

"Air warfare has come a long way since the Second World and nowhere was that more apparent today than in the skies over Eastbourne as two Lancaster bombers were joined by jet planes from the Red Arrows. The Lancasters, made famous by the Dambusters raid, took part in a flyby over Eastbourne beach along with a Spitfire and a Hurricane as part of a tour to commemorate the Battle of Britain. The Lancaster Thumper was joined the Canadian Lancaster Vera from a museum in Ontario for what will likely be the last time. The pair of aircraft will be taking place in about 60 events across the UK in the next five weeks. The Lancasters are equipped with four Packard Merlin engines which are capable of pushing the 102ft wide bomber up to 275mph. By comparison the modern-day red Arrows fly the Hawk T1 aircraft. Powered by a Rolls Royce jet engine they are capable of flying at 600mph, though have a much smaller wingspan of 30ft. The Lancaster bombers will be perfoming with the Red Arrows  in Eastbourne at the Airbourne air festival for the next four days, before the historic bombers move on to the Flying Proms at Old Warden, Bedfordshire.

"A 'controlling' bigamist has been jailed for life for murdering his wife and hiding her body in the boot of a car. Pierre Legris killed his wife, Rui Li, by hitting her over the head at the home they shared in Bournemouth, Dorset, before driving her body to the garage owned by his other wife, Irene Smith. Ms Li's body was later driven to a nearby road by Legris' son, Jonathan, where it was found by police in the boot of the abandoned car a week later. Murdered: Pierre Legris, left, killed his wife, Rui Li, right, by hitting her over the head at the home they shared in Bournemouth, Dorset. He was jailed for life at Winchester Crown Court today . Legris, also known as Alain Baron, will serve a minimum of 25 years in prison after being found guilty of murder at Winchester Crown Court today. The trial heard that Legris was believed to have killed Ms Li to benefit from her life insurance policy worth £300,000 to help pay off the 'desperate' financial debts of the three defendants. The couple also ran a massage company from their home which provided 'sexual services' and that Pierre Legris would sometimes join in, the court was told. The couple were also involved in local swinging networks, it was said. Legri struck 44-year-old Li, a Chinese national, at their home before wrapping her in a building sheet while she was still alive, the court was told. He said: 'No such heavy weapon has been found and in addition very little blood was found at the scene - it suggests a thorough clean-up has been done to prevent blood from escaping to the scene nearby.' Jonathan Legris, right, a former racing car driver was convicted of assisting an offender by driving the Fiat Punto with Ms Li's body inside. Irene Smith, left, was jailed for three years . Mr Lickley said that Pierre Legris had bought several bags of cement and added: 'It may be there was a plan to bury Rui Li under the floor of that property. He said that Ms Li's body was then placed in Legris' Ford Transit van which the following day was taken to Cromer Motors, owned by 66-year-old Smith. There, Jonathan Legris replaced the starter motor while Ms Li's body lay in the back of the van. Mr Lickley added that the body was later moved to a Fiat Punto, owned by Jonathan Legris, which he abandoned in a nearby road. Her body was found a week later. The prosecutor said that following the killing, Pierre Legris was 'cool and focused and clear in what he was doing'. Jailed: Pierre Legris, right, with wife Irene, whom he married in 1987, and their son Johnathan Legris . He added: 'He rushed or in a panic, he had a plan and it involved others, his son, Jonathan Legris and his other wife Irene Smith'. Legris reported Li missing the following week after colleagues at Poole Hospital began to make inquiries to her whereabouts. Her daughter from a previous marriage, Lu Yao, 18, had also begun asking questions about her mother. Legris denied murder but admitted perverting the course of justice. He told the court that he only moved her body after finding her dead in their home. He said he had tried to hide his wife's body because he was worried that their unconventional sex life would be made public. The judge, Mr Justice Dingemans, said that as well as a financial motive, Pierre Legris might have murdered Ms Li because of her decision to adopt a child. He said: 'It may equally have been the fact that Pierre Legris, as a controlling person, was not prepared to deal with the apparently late decision that Ms Li had made to adopt a child from China which would have compromised his way of living.' The scene in Verwood Crescent, Bournemouth, where Ms Li's body was found in the boot of a car last year . Jailing Pierre Legris, Judge Dingemans said: 'I am sure the murder of Ms Li was planned with great care and the murder weapon must have been placed for Pierre Legris to render Ms Li unconscious and without any noise. There was a clear intention to kill.' Before the start of the trial, Legris pleaded guilty to an offence of bigamy by marrying Ms Li in 2007 while having been married to Irene Smith since 1987. Legris was sentenced to three years imprisonment to run concurrently for the bigamy offence, with no separate penalty for perverting the course of justice. His son, Jonathan Legris, a former racing car driver was convicted of assisting an offender by driving the Fiat Punto with Ms Li's body inside. He was jailed for two years. The judge said: 'He was prepared to do anything for his father, that is obvious. My view is I still have not heard the full truth of what his father told him.' Smith,was found guilty of perverting the course of justice by providing a false alibi to her husband, and she was also convicted of assisting an offender by hiring a storage facility to hide her husband's clothes and French passport. She was jailed for three years on each offence to run concurrently. Jonathan Legris and Smith were both cleared of a charge of conspiracy to murder.","Rui Li, 44, was found dead in the boot of a Fiat Punto on May 30 last year .

"Labour's big idea to launch a £15billion raid on pensions to fund a cut in the tuition fees of students was described as ‘financially illiterate’ yesterday. Ed Miliband confirmed he would slash fees from £9,000 to £6,000, despite warnings it would benefit the better-off and could damage universities. The Labour leader said the measure would help relieve the ‘scourge of debt’ which he said was holding back young people and the economy. Ed Miliband: University vice-chancellors have warned that his fees pledge could cause 'colossal' damage by slashing funding for higher education . But his announcement that Labour will raid middle-class pension pots to pay for it sparked a furious backlash. Among the critics was the respected consumer champion Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com, who condemned them as ‘financially illiterate’. The tuition fee cut would apply from September 2016, including students mid-way through courses. Labour plans to raise the money through two pension changes. The first is cutting tax relief from pensioners earning more than £150,000 from 45p to 20p. This saving had been earmarked to fund a ‘jobs guarantee’ for the young unemployed, but Labour sources admit the falling number of jobless young people means this would cost less than expected. Secondly, the party would cut the ‘lifetime allowance’ for pensions from £1.25million to £1million and cap the amount which can be put away per year from £40,000 to £30,000. Newly indebted: Graduates must pay back fees of £9,000, on top of other costs of getting educated . Under this threshold, pension savings would be taxed at the rate of income, with the first 25 per cent tax-free. But above this level, a punitive rate of 55 per cent would apply. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies described the pensions raid as ‘misguided’. Paul Johnson, director of the influential think-tank, said the policy entailed a ‘significant tax increase’. IFS analysis found the biggest winners from the change would be ‘mid-to-high-income graduates … with the very highest earners benefiting the most’. It said the plan would have little impact on the number of young people from poorer backgrounds entering higher education as they have not been put off by the hike to £9,000. Mr Lewis said: ‘This is the worst type of politics … that may appeal to people on the surface, but it’s financially illiterate.’ He added that the policy ‘effectively meant poorer students would be subsidising City investment banking graduates’ – and said if any other party had launched it, Labour would be leading protests in the streets. Mr Miliband claimed the £2.9billion-a-year pensions raid, for at least five years, would only hit the very wealthy. But Treasury analysis suggested the move would hit thousands of ordinary public sector workers, such as teachers, nurses and fire crews. The Labour leader also revealed high-earning graduates would face higher interest charges on student loans, to fund bigger bursaries for the poor – a policy critics called a ‘tax on aspiration’. David Cameron said Labour’s ‘ill-thought-out’ plan would ‘damage our universities and our economy, and hardworking taxpayers would pay the price’. Chancellor George Osborne added: ‘[Ed Miliband’s] new tax on pensions will hit many people on middle incomes … a tuition fees policy that only benefits better-off students is being paid for by hard-working taxpayers on middle incomes.’ Speaking at Leeds School of Music yesterday, Mr Miliband said his pledge to cut tuition fees was ‘cast-iron’, adding: ‘The scourge of debt from tuition fees is not only holding back our young people, it is a burden on our country. We’re going to change it.’ But Treasury analysis found the proposed £30,000 cap on annual pension contributions would hit those on final salary schemes who receive a promotion late in their careers. For example, a senior nurse earning £35,500 and promoted to matron on £53,500 after 25 years would face a potential £5,000 tax charge. A teacher on £27,000 promoted to head on £43,000 would face a tax bill of £900. Consumer champion Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com said Labour's policy was 'financially illiterate' Saga warned funding a tuition fees cut by curbing tax relief on pensions was ‘playing Russian roulette with people’s futures’. Spokesman Paul Green said: ‘Of course education is crucial … but so too is ensuring we foster a savings culture where people ensure they put enough by for their futures.’ Tom McPhail, of Hargreaves Lansdown, said Labour’s plan was ‘reckless’ and would ‘penalise responsible middle-income workers who want to provide for their retirement and make sure they aren’t a burden on the state’. He added retirement savings were being viewed as a ‘piggy bank which can be raided to pay for pre-election promises’. Mr Miliband guaranteed to plug the university funding gap caused by the fees cut, for at least five years. But Wendy Piatt, of the Russell Group of top universities, said members ‘remain cautious’ as the plan would make them ‘vulnerable to future cuts’. A Shadow Cabinet source said it was clear the money could be better spent elsewhere – but said Mr Miliband feared his credibility would be hit if he backed down. 'There are lots of people who don't think it's worth the candle,' the source said. 'Reducing fees from £9,000 to £6,000 does not look like a game-changer, particularly this late in the day. It's a lot of money to spend to leave fees at double the level they were when we left office. 'But Ed sees this as a policy that he is personally associated with and thinks he can't abandon it. He won't be talked out of it, so that's that.' Nick Pearce, head of the Downing Street policy unit under Gordon Brown, said the plan to cut tuition fees 'may not be a good policy'. He added: If I had upwards of £2 billion (a year) to spend on any policy, I would direct it into early-years education and childcare, not a reduction in tuition fees.' Mr Pearce, now director of Mr Miliband's favourite think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the Coalition's controversial reforms to tuition fees would lead to long-term problems for the public finances, but had not damaged young people's enthusiasm for university. 'The Coalition's reforms have been very successful at increasing funding for universities, protecting fair access and upholding student numbers (with the significant exception of part-time students, whose numbers have fallen dramatically), while at the same time cutting public spending,' he said. How do tuition fees work now? A degree can cost up to £9,000 year in tuition fees. Medicine and law degrees can cost more. Rent, living expenses and books are covered by a separate loan. Unless students have wealthy parents, they need to apply for a loan from the Student Loans Company. It is paid directly from the SLC to the university. But it’s each student’s responsibility to pay it back once they graduate. The interest rate is charged at different rates according to income, up to 5.5 per cent. In Germany, tuition fees have just been scrapped, while in the US the vast majority of students benefit from grants, scholarships or work-study schemes to keep the cost down. Do the loans get repaid? Students repay 9 per cent of everything they earn above a £21,000-a-year threshold. This is set to rise with average earnings from 2017. A graduate then continues to repay until they have cleared what they borrowed plus interest, or until 30 years have elapsed since the April after they graduated – whichever comes first. In practice, all but the highest-paid graduates end up repaying debt for all of the three decades. After 30 years, the debt is cleared, by which time the average earner will have repaid £46,300. The rising numbers of overseas students has led to fears thousands are deliberately avoiding loan repayments. This is because it is difficult to get the cash back through the UK tax system when foreign students return home. Would Labour’s plan help? Critics warn Labour’s plan to cut tuition fees to £6,000 a year by cutting tax relief on pensions would actually benefit the better-off. They say cutting fees helps those with a high starting salary as they can get rid of the debt more quickly. Calculations by Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert show only those earning £35,000 a year, with inflation-linked pay rises, would benefit – including trainee lawyers and bankers. Estimates by the Institute of Fiscal Studies also suggest the plans would help top earners. Most lower-earning graduates would be unaffected, it said. How would this affect pensions? Capping pension pots at £1million means a 65-year-old who swaps this pot for an inflation-linked annuity – an insurance policy which pays out until you die – for themselves and their spouse would get no more than £27,000 a year. For savers desperate to retire on a comfortable income, this is hardly aspirational – and would not encourage saving. For those in generous final salary schemes funded by their employer – public sector workers and civil servants – the limit would mean they could take up to £50,000. Others say cuts are likely only to hurt those whom the policy is supposed to help. It will do nothing to redistribute wealth from those who have already accumulated large pension pots, and instead simply restrict opportunities to build up a big pension for those just starting work. Hasn’t Labour already pledged to cut the rate of relief? Yes. It previously said it would use the money, an estimated £500million, to fund its compulsory jobs guarantee and apprenticeships. But this will now be covered instead by a planned surplus from corporation tax receipts in the wake of a cut and freeze of business rates.","Miliband fears his credibility would be hit if he backs down on pledge .

"The parents of American journalist James Foley have said that the U.S. government and press didn't do enough to keep their son from being killed by Islamic State militants. John and Diane Foley, speaking at a University of Arizona forum on Thursday, said the government shut them out and failed to help them while their son, a freelance journalist, was held captive for nearly two years. His parents also spoke about the identity of their son's killer, 'Jihadi John', after he was revealed as 26-year-old Mohammed Emwazi from London. Scroll down for video . Journalist James Foley's parents, John and Diane, said during a university event on Thursday (pictured) that identifying their son's killer  did not matter to them . James Foley, 40, was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012 and executed in August 2014. He was shown in an ISIS propaganda video alongside the extremist killer. 'The point is if we capture him and bring him to justice, what does that do? ISIS is still doing its thing. It's a very narrow approach. The only thing I'll be happy with is when ISIS is defeated,' John Foley said on Thursday. 'The next ""Jihadi John"" is on the way.' Emwazi had a privileged upbringing which included earning a computer science degree from University of Westminster. Diane Foley said that the details of his background 'makes that even more sad that he'd want to use his gifts for such evil and such hatred. It's very frightening to me'. Mrs Foley added: 'We need to forgive him for not having a clue what he was doing.' Mr Foley said he would not dwell on the background of his son's killer. 'In all fairness, discovering who he is might be important to some people but it's certainly not important to me,' he said outside the forum, according to KLTV. James Foley, 40, was executed by Islamic State militants in August 2014, which was broadcast by ISIS in a video with 'Jihadi John'. The Foleys were joined at the Arizona event by Terry Anderson, a former Associated Press correspondent who was held captive in Lebanon for nearly seven years, and David McGraw, an attorney for The New York Times. The group agreed that the government uses the policy of not paying ransom or negotiating with terrorists to avoid answering questions to families about the state of their loved ones. They said officials kept families in the dark. 'For one year, we didn't really know where he was or whether he was alive,' Mr Foley said. 'We had no one who was accountable for Jim, if you will,' Mrs Foley added. She said outside the forum that what she wanted was a clearer policy so 'our journalists going out in the field can be protected, and valued. And then American hostage families can be respected and our government can treat us with some honesty'. The Foleys echoed the sentiments of the family of Kayla Mueller, a young international aid worker who recently was killed while held captive by militants . Ms Mueller's family said in an interview on NBC's 'Today' that U.S. government policies were contradictory and prevented the 26-year-old from Prescott, Arizona, from being rescued. A White House spokesman said the government acted in the best interest of the nation. The Foleys said that the government uses the policy of not ransoming captives or negotiating with terrorist groups to avoid keeping the loves ones of hostages such as their son (pictured) informed . Diane Foley (right, with husband John in August 2014 soon after their son's death was announced) said that Emwazi's privilege 'makes that even more sad that he'd want to use his gifts for such evil' James Foley's parents also said some responsibility lies with the American media, who failed to continue reporting on their son's kidnapping, letting it fall out of the news cycle. 'We're a hot item when it's a fresh story, but after the item dissipates, we couldn't catch a cold,' Mr Foley said. The parents have created a foundation named after their son to help Americans held captive abroad. Mr McGraw said the U.S. has inconsistent policies for dealing with kidnapped US citizens. An example, he said, was the exchange of members of a militant group affiliated with the Taliban for the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. 'I think the idea of telling families that they shouldn't even talk to the hostage takers is really, really bad advice,' Mr McGraw said. The panelists focused on the importance of journalism and of affording protections for freelance journalists, who don't have the financial backing of large news organizations and are often in more danger. 'You can't have a free society without a free press,' said Mr Anderson, who now teaches at the University of Florida.","John and Diane Foley claim they were kept in the dark about their son during his time as an ISIS hostage and the US did not do enough .

"The parents of a cancer stricken boy who adored superheroes have revealed their son's dying wish - that they make other children smile after his death. Showing courage beyond his years, four-year-old Henry Allen decided to end treatment for a rare neuroblastoma cancer so he could go home. The youngster, who always dressed as Batman, had battled the illness for two years, when he announced: ‘It isn’t going to work mummy. I think I should go home to my bed and my toys.’ Dawn Allen, 37, and father Mark, 36, have spoken of the proud moment their son, Henry, revealed his dying wish - that they make other children smile when he was gone . His parents Dawn, 37, and Mark Allen, 36, from Milton Keynes, had been agonising over how long to continue treatment after being told it was in vain - until brave Henry made the decision for them. He even refused to open toys, knowing he would not get the chance to play with them, and insisted they be given to the hospital instead. To fulfil Henry's dying wish, his parents have now set up a trust to spread joy in his name. Dubbed Henry’s Happiness Trust, it has already brought cheer to other youngsters battling cancer. 'Henry wanted to be like Superman and Batman but he was far more amazing than both of them put together,' said Mrs Allen, a teaching assistant. Henry's dying wish for his parents to make other sick children happy means they have now set up a trust to spread joy in his name named Henry's Happiness Trust . The youngster, who always dressed as Batman or Spiderman, had battled a rare cancer called neuroblastoma . ‘He was a real life superhero who, despite his own illness, went out of his way to make all the other poorly children smile. ‘Henry always had a smile for everyone and his dying wish was for us to make other children smile too. Saying goodbye to our superhero broke our hearts but fulfilling his dying wish to spread happiness and joy keeps us going. ‘Henry’s cancer was missed many times but we refuse to be bitter or angry because ultimately we just feel so lucky to have had such an amazing little boy.’ Mrs Allen and her husband Mark, a development and design manager, had feared they could not have a baby after four years of trying and were looking into adoption when Dawn learned she was expecting Henry whom she describes as being her ‘miracle.’ Dawn explained that while the family had been dealt a terrible blow, Henry would organise fun for everyone and make them all laugh and giggle . His parents say he was a real life superhero who, despite his own illness, went out of his way to make all the other poorly children smile . ‘We felt like the luckiest parents alive,' she recalls. 'Henry was such an easy going loveable baby. People would stop me in the street to tell me how gorgeous his big smile was.’ But when Henry fell ill as a toddler, Mrs Allen, initially told it was nothing to worry about, was left devastated when a stage four neuroblastoma was diagnosed. ‘We just put our arms around each other and sobbed,' says the grieving mother. 'He was given a 20 per cent chance of survival and like any parent in that situation, we prayed he would be in that 20 per cent.’ The next day, the little boy started chemotherapy to shrink tumours in his tummy and liver. But far from being miserable, happy Henry treated it all as one great big adventure. When doctors came to listen to his heart, he’d roar like a lion to make them laugh and then high five the nurses. Speaking about her son, Dawn said: 'What he was doing was incredible and we just hoped that he had the power to fight the cancer as well as making everyone laugh and smile' They decided his funeral should be a celebration of his life with a Spiderman casket pulled by Ninja Turtles . Henry was carried in a Spiderman casket because of his love of superheroes . Dressed in one of his favourite superhero costumes, he’d stroll around the ward giving out ‘Henry hugs’ to cheer up all the other sick children. Just after his third birthday, he had two operations to remove the tumours followed by more chemotherapy. He even kept smiling even when his hair fell out but after just a few months, the cancer returned once more. To his parents it was a huge blow but Henry took it in his stride and when he was admitted to hospital over Easter he organised an egg and spoon race for the other young patients. ‘That was typical,' says Mrs Allen. 'We’d been dealt a terrible blow but here he was organising fun for everyone and making them all laugh and giggle. ‘The children raced up and down the ward dodging machines and cheering. Henry was always happy no matter what. Seeing the joy he brought left us in no doubt that he was a superhero.’ In fact, a close friend made Henry his own superhero cape emblazoned with a H.  ‘He was thrilled, he absolutely loved it,' says Mrs Allen. 'He started wearing it around the ward and became known as Super Henry. What he was doing was incredible and we just hoped that he had the power to fight the cancer as well as making everyone laugh and smile.’ But more scans revealed new tumours in his liver, oesophagus and abdomen. A close friend made Henry his own superhero cape emblazoned with a H. Dawn . Dawn said that while Henry may have only been four years old, he was telling her what he wanted when he decided to go home. 'This was how Henry wanted to spend his time and as heartbreaking as it was for us as parents, those were his wishes,' she said . That’s when consultants called Dawn and Mark into a side room and broke the devastating news that Henry might have as little as six weeks left. 'We were floored,' says Mrs Allen. 'I begged them to try and save him. He was my miracle. She told me she would do her best because the whole ward loved Henry. 'I was so moved but still struggled to take it in.’ But Henry had other ideas. The next day, he asked his mother to nip out for while. While she was gone, Henry took all the Lego from the playroom and turned his room into a mini Legoland. ‘When I got back there was Lego everywhere,' she says. 'He’d even drawn paper tickets and gave them out to all the other children on the ward and invited them to come and visit Legoland.’ But later that day as he slept, one of his regular nurses came in to check on him and emotional Mrs Allen turned to her for advice. ‘I asked her how we would know when it was time to stop the treatment now he was terminal. But as she went to open her mouth to answer I heard a little voice and it was Henry. ‘He just looked up at me and said: ""Mummy it isn’t going to work. I think I should go home to my bed and my toys."" 'My heart was literally breaking in half as he spoke but deep down I knew he was right. He may have only been four years old but he was telling me what he wanted. 'This was how Henry wanted to spend his time and as heartbreaking as it was for us as parents, those were his wishes.’ His parents wasted no time in fulfilling Henry's wish that they spread happiness by helping other children by setting up the Henry Allen Trust . The following day the couple took him home but Mrs Allen, conscious that time was running out, was desperate for Henry to enjoy one last Christmas. 'So in October 2013, friends turned the family’s garden into a winter wonderland complete with Father Christmas, presents and even horses dressed as reindeer. ‘Henry was weak but his face lit up,' says his mother. 'Only when he saw the pile of presents he didn’t want to open them: . 'He said: ""It’s OK mummy and daddy. My friends will play with them. You need to help the other children now"". ‘We looked at each other because he was telling us he knew he was never going to play with those toys and he was telling us wanted he wanted us to do.’ Three days later, the youngster died peacefully on the sofa at home while holding his parents’ hands. They decided his funeral should be a celebration of his life with a Spiderman casket pulled by Ninja Turtles. And they wasted no time in fulfilling Henry’s wish that they spread happiness by helping other children by setting up the Henry Allen Trust. So far they’ve arranged visits to sick children from their favourite characters, fun days out, guitar lessons from reality TV stars and gifts. ‘It’s hard without Henry but keeping others kids smiling the way he used to keeps us going,' says Mrs Allen. 'We may not have had him for long but we will always feel so very lucky that Henry the little Superhero was ours.’","Henry Allen decided to end cancer treatment so he could go home .

"Coffee could have a protective effect against multiple sclerosis (MS), new research has found. People who don't drink the beverage are around one-and-a-half times more likely to develop MS than those who drink several cups a day, the study claims. Scientists attribute the effect to caffeine, which has already been linked to a reduced risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Previous research found drinking four cups of coffee a day could also cut the risk of diabetes by 25 per cent. People who do not drink coffee are about one-and-a-half times more likely to develop Multiple Sclerosis than those who drink several cups a day, a study has found . Worldwide, it is estimated that more than 2.5 million people  have MS, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Trust. MS is a condition of the central nervous system, where the coating around nerve fibres (called myelin) is damaged, causing a range of symptoms. The specific symptoms that appear depend upon which part of the central nervous system is affected and the job of the damaged nerve. People with MS might suffer fatigue, vision problems and difficulties with walking, but the condition is different for everyone. It is usually diagnosed in people aged 20 to 40, and it affects almost three times as many women as men. The researchers analysed data from two Swedish and US studies comparing a total of 2,788 people with MS and almost 4,000 healthy individuals. Both studies found that participants who did not drink coffee were more likely to develop MS than those who drank many cups every day. The Swedish study found that people who drank no coffee were one and a half times more likely to develop the disease than people who who drank at least six cups of coffee per day during the year before symptoms appeared. Drinking large amounts of coffee five or 10 years before symptoms started was similarly protective. In the US study, people who didn't drink coffee increased their risk of developing MS by one and a half times, compared to those who drank four or more cups of coffee per day in the year before symptoms started to develop. Worldwide, it is estimated that more than 2.5 million people  have MS, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Trust. The new study found caffeine might protect against the condition . Lead researcher Dr Ellen Mowry, from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, US, said: 'Caffeine intake has been associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. 'Our study shows that coffee intake may also protect against MS, supporting the idea that the drug may have protective effects for the brain. 'Caffeine should be studied for its impact on relapses and long-term disability in MS as well.' The findings were presented at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in Washington DC. Dr Sorrel Bickley, of the MS Society, said: 'It's vital in our fight to stop MS that we learn more about the role of environmental factors in the cause of the condition. 'Over 100,00 people in the UK have MS and this new study may give us yet another clue in understanding how the condition develops. 'However we can't yet judge whether these results provide meaningful new evidence as they've only been presented at a conference and haven't been peer reviewed in an academic journal. 'It's important to bear in mind that the overall risk of developing MS is low, so we would urge people not to worry about making changes to their diet and lifestyle based on these results alone.'","Those who do not drink coffee are 1.5 times more likely to develop MS .

"These are the painful ice burns suffered by the British schoolboy who miraculously survived a 2,500ft fall in the Alps despite bouncing off rocks and ice as he tumbled down the mountain. Jack Fox, 14, stopped to take a photo on a rocky ledge during a school ski trip to Flattach near Salzburg, Austria last week. But despite falling the equivalent of two and a half Eiffel Towers, the Year 10 student survived with just ice burns to his arms. Lucky escape: Jack Fox, 14, suffered just this ice burn despite bouncing off rocks and ice as he tumbled 2,500ft down the mountain . Jack, an accomplished skier from Southport, Merseyside, fell on the very last run of his school's six-day, £850-per-head break. A group of eight children were with an Austrian ski instructor when they took their skis off so they could take pictures of the scenery. But as he lined up his photo, Jack slid over the edge and  plunged down the mountain-side. He said: 'I thought that was it – that I'd be killed. I remembered it was a complete sheer drop to the mountain floor. I said to myself: 'Jack, it's only you that could do this.' 'But as I came down the mountain I kept trying to dig my feet in and pull up with my arms. 'I was crashing through ice and bouncing off rocks. It was terrifying. It felt like I was falling forever. I kept thinking 'How much more of this can I take?' The year 10 student fell from a height equivalent to two Eiffel Towers but says it hasn't put him off the sport . 'Eventually I came to a halt. I checked everywhere to make sure I hadn't broken anything and it all seemed fine. 'When I looked back up the mountain I thought: 'I've just fallen from there'. It was only then that I noticed the pain in my arms'. His cries for help were heard by an extreme skier and rescuers soon arrived and airlifted him off the mountain. He was later handed the smashed ski helmet that saved his life, which had virtually disintegrated during the fall. He said: 'It was a sunny day and other people had taken their helmets off to take pictures. I kept mine on – and I'm so glad I did. Without it I wouldn't have survived.' Doctors found he had severe ice burns on his left arm and only slightly less serious ones on his right. He was kept in overnight because of the concussion he had suffered. After being flown back to Britain he went into surgery at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, for a deep skin scrub under anaesthetic. 'That was worse than the fall itself,' said Jack, a pupil at Tarleton Academy. Jack, pictured with his mother Amanda, 41, and brother, Ryan, 13, had stopped to take a photo when he fell . Sore: Jack is expected to return to school on Monday, after recovering from a 'skin scrub' on his wounds at Alder Hey Children's Hospital . Describing the fall, he added: 'One moment it was fine, the next my boots were slipping and I was gone. 'I heard later the rest of the party were crying and praying for me. They thought I was a gonner, and the instructor was pretty upset. 'I know I'm really lucky. My teachers said I should go out and by a lottery ticket – I was bound to win'. Jack's father Stewart Fox, 48, found out about the accident when he received a call from his son's teacher. He said: 'I got the call from this distressed teacher and because of the tone of his voice, the first thing I asked was 'Is he alive?' 'When you pack your lad away to Austria on a skiing trip and get a teacher in distress, you think the worst. 'He was with the advanced party and went to the top of the mountain and to a well known beauty spot up on a ledge.' Ski resort: The accident happened in the Alps near Flattach, not far from Salzburg, Austria. File photo . Mr Fox added: 'Apparently all these people were taking photos at this area. He was facing forward and taking photos of the view. 'He just lost his footing. He's very keen to stress he was not taking a selfie because it makes him sound stupid. It could have so easily been the dreaded call.' 'His friends were all praying and in tears at the top. They couldn't go and look because they would follow him and they would be like lemmings. They all thought he was dead. 'When the teacher told me he was alive, my thoughts went from sheer dread to relief. He could very very easily have died. 'They told him in the helicopter it was 2,500ft he fell. He tells me he used his boots to try and dig in and slow himself down and then as soon as he did they gripped and they flipped over. I don't think he realised how fast he was going.' His mother Amanda, 41, had nothing but praise for Jack's teacher, Jack Snowden and the rest of the teachers. 'We've absolutely no complaints. They were brilliant'. Jack is expected to return to school on Monday, after recovering from a 'skin scrub' on his wounds at Alder Hey Children's Hospital. It is unclear whether his scars will be permanent. But none of the drama has put Jack, who has been skiing for two years, off the sport. He said: 'I haven't been put off at all, I'm definitely going to be carrying on.' His father added: 'It wasn't the skiing that caused this, it was the photography! I don't have any worries about him going back out on the slopes.'","14-year-old  was on school trip to Austria when he stopped to take photo .

"Fined: Ira Rennert (pictured in December) was hit with a $118million penalty over money he took from his mining company . The billionaire owner of one of the largest and most lavish homes in the U.S. was fined $118million on Friday for pillaging his mining firm to pay for the mansion. Ira Rennert, 80, who owned a magnesium company which went bankrupt in 2001, paid himself huge dividends even though he knew expensive court battles would soon hit the company. A jury in Manhattan agreed that he and his company, Renco Group Inc., siphoned off the cash in breach of his trust to shareholders in the company, named MagCorp. They pointed to his enormous home in the Hamptons, a 29-room mansion called Fairfield, as proof of how he profited from removing the money from his firm, called MagCorp. His lawyers had tried to argue that it was the recession following the dotcom bubble which actually finished the company - but the jury decided in favor of MagCorp's creditors. The luxury home sits not far from the beach in exclusive Sagaponack. To go with its 29 bed chambers, it has 39 bathrooms, a 164-seat theater, basketball court, gymnasium two-lane bowling alley, and a 100-car garage. It is valued around $500million. The house that MagCorp built? A jury decided that Rennert breached his obligations to shareholders when taking $120million out of the company - which they say he used to build his luxury Hamptons home, above . While the fine demanded was $118million, to match a $120million payout around 2001, after interest is applied, Rennert could be stung for as much as $400million, according to Bloomberg. Rennert was born in Brooklyn in 1934, and went on to graduate from Brooklyn College before landing a job on Wall Street and finding financial success. In addition to his home on Long Island, he also owns an apartment at 625 Park Avenue in Manhattan and is worth an estimated $6.1billion according to Forbes.

"After the identity of Jihadi John was finally revealed, disturbing links between the former London student and other known extremists across the UK and abroad have emerged. The 26-year-old, who fled his family in west London to join extremists in Syria in 2012, has been named as the executioner of Britons Alan Henning and David Haines. He is also responsible for the deaths of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Japanese reporter Kenji Goto and Syrian soldiers, having appeared in sadistic films in which he slit victims throats after preaching on behalf of terrorists with his face by a sinister black mask. Scroll down for video . As Jihadi John is unmasked as former computing student Mohammed Emwazi, his connections to terror suspects across London and abroad have been revealed . Yesterday the Mail revealed Emwazi attended a Church of England school in north London before studying computing at the University of Westminster. Scotland Yard is refusing to answer questions about his identity after claims he was known to police before fleeing the country. But as it's revealed the man was picked up by authorities trying to enter Tanzania in 2009, more chilling links between Emwazi and a London underworld of terrorist activity have emerged. The most concerning are Emwazi's connections to a hub of fanatics reportedly known to the authorities as 'the London Boys'. Alongside a handful of others he was named in 2011 court documents in which the group is described as 'members of a network of United Kingdom and East African based Islamist extremists'. A number of the group, thought to have been trained in Somalia, have travelled to Syria with at least one now dead. Most of the men are thought to have grown up in north and north west London, engaging in gang activity to fund extremist tendencies. They are thought to include Bilal Berjawi, Mohamed Sakr and Choukri Ellekhlifi, all of whom died have been killed in war zones, the Times reports. Berjawi fled St John's Wood, where Emrazi is thought to have attended school, to join jihadis in Somalia. He was killed in an airstrike in 2013 while Sakr died the previous year. Ellekhlifi, from Paddington, died in an attack in Aleppo in 2013. The  home Emwazi shared with his family before travelling to Syria is less than two miles from where failed bombers Muktar Said Ibrahim and Ramzi Mohammed were found in 2005. The pair were convicted of involvement in an attempted attack on London's public transport system. And in chillingly similar circumstances to his own family, Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a former rapper previously fingered as the man behind Jihadi John's mask, grew up in a council house in Maida Vale. The 26-year-old grew up less than two miles from where Muktar Said Ibrahim and Ramzi Mohammed were arrested in 2005 after plotting an attack on London's public transport system . The extremist lived in the same area as Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary who was previously named as the man behind Jihadi John's mask. Bary is also in Syria . Emwazi graduated from the University of Westminster (pictured) in 2009 with a degree in computing. The university has been described as a 'hotbed' for radicalism in the past but denies inciting extremism in any form . Haitham al-Haddad, an anti-gay Muslim preacher, was due to speak at the University of Westminster where Emwazi was a student . Bary, who became the focus of rife speculation over the jihadi's identity, also appears on the social media accounts of Emwazi's brother's friends. The youngster's Facebook page revealed he was friends with a handful of people to have supported Islamic preachers. There is no suggestion Emwazi's brother has engaged in any form of extremist or terrorist activity. Among preachers mentioned in the profiles of his friends however are some to have appeared at Westminster University. It has in the past been accused of inciting Islamic extremism among students after a range of controversial religious figures were invited to speak at its events. Yesterday former student Raheem Kassam said: 'I once walked into a meeting of the Islamic Society where they were clapping and cheering the events of 9/11. ‘I did not know him, he would have been two years behind me, but I am utterly unsurprised.' Westminster was named in a 2009 report as having invited three hate preachers to give a talk in 2006, and just days before Emwazi's identity was revealed, thousands signed a petition to block an event where an anti-gay figure was due to speak. Students previously expressed fears over the election of a former student union president  and vice president alleged to have been connected to the group Hizb ut-Tahrir. Tarik Mahri and Jamal Achchi were elected in 2011 after sharing their support of the pro-Islamic state group online. Neither former student has responded to MailOnline's request for comment. Since news of Emwazi's connection with ISIS in Syria broke, the university's Islamic Society has distanced itself from having any involvement. This week a petition attracted more than 3,000 signatures calling for a controversial Muslim preacher not to be allowed to give a talk . Haitham al-Haddad, who has spoken against homosexuality in the past, was due to speak at an event titled 'Who is Muhammed'. Members of the university's LGBT community protested against the visit scheduled just days before a Pride event. It was cancelled as Westminster alumnus Emwazi was named as jihadi seen in ISIS propaganda videos. 'The ISOC would like to clarify it has nothing to do with an individual who has come to be known as ""Jihadi John"" who was recently identified as Mohammed Emwazi,' a statement on the organisation's Facebook page said last night. Students at the university however claimed the society guarded the identity of the society's president. When contacted by MailOnline the society did not respond. In a separate statement the university said it was offering support to students and took the allegations 'very seriously'. Emwazi's parents have been reported by neighbours as being too upset to speak. It is understood they thought their son had travelled to the Middle East to carry out aid work. He was also named alongside other terror suspects thought to have been trained by al-Shabaab militants in Somalia.

Prosecutors claimed an argument ensued when his wife learned of the situation and Allen killed her while the couple's two children were at school. He was convicted in December. In her closing statement, Monmouth County Assistant Prosecutor Maria Franceschini picked up the frying pan wrapped in plastic and swung it to show jurors how Allen struck his wife over the head. She then showed jurors autopsy photos showing the result of Kimberly Allen being struck by the frying pan. 'The past three years has been a living hell for our family. What Pat Allen did is incomprehensible, despicable and heinous. He stole the life of a loving, beautiful mother, daughter, sister and aunt,' said her grieving father . 'The loss of Kim is profound and there will always be a hole in our hearts.' Patrick's son Matthew Allen was in court for the sentencing but did not speak. Their other son, Ryan, was not in the courtroom. 'They will never have their incredible mom to turn to, to watch them play sports, to see them graduate, to talk to or to be there when they become parents themselves,' Wieghorst said in court. 'This is their life story now, their father killed their mother.'

"A 12-year-old girl became pregnant and had an abortion after a sex session in a church porch which was interrupted by a curate. The shocked churchman heard the girl having sex with her 17-year-old boyfriend and opened the door to see him getting up and her lying on the ground. She denied having sex with the boy but was forced to admit the truth after she became pregnant and tests on the foetus showed he was the father. The curate heard a male and a female talking about sex and  'noises consistent with sexual activity' as he approached the church porch in Paignton, Devon, file photograph,  in March, 2014 . Simon Saunders, now 18, of Torquay, Devon, admitted sexual activity with a child and was ordered to receive one to one counselling as part of an 18 month community order. Judge Graham Cottle, sitting at Exeter Crown Court told him he needed to learn how to deal with sexual situations in an appropriate way. Richard Crabb, prosecuting, said the curate of the church in Paignton, disturbed the couple when he heard noise coming from the porch as he was preparing for a morning service in March. He said: 'The curate went to investigate and heard a male and female talking about having sex and noises which were consistent with sexual activity. 'He walked towards them and disturbed them and saw the girl on the ground with her legs apart and the defendant getting up from above her. 'He recognised both of them because he had seen them both hanging around the churchyard after school. He knew their names and the police were informed. 'The girl was video interviewed and denied any sexual activity had taken place but her mother later contacted the police to say she was pregnant and she was interviewed again and confirmed there had been sexual activity. 'She had a termination and tests showed a very strong scientific support for the proposition that the defendant was the father.' Mr Joss Ticehurst, defending, said Saunders had been in a relationship with the girl but was unaware of her true age. He said he has learned his lesson and will now check that any future partner was above the age of consent before engaging in a sexual relationship.

"Writer Sally Wainwright yesterday claimed TV viewers are too sensitive to violence against women but never offended by assaults on men. Referring to an episode of her hit drama Happy Valley in which a policewoman was brutally attacked in a cellar, Miss Wainwright said she wanted to make the scene even more graphic but was stopped by the BBC. The show attracted criticism from viewers for showing 'gratuitous' violence against women. Sally Wainwright,  the screenwriter for Happy Valley, defended the latest episode where a policewoman  (Sarah Lancashire) was brutally attacked in a cellar . Episode four of the first series attracted 15 complaints after it showed police sergeant Catherine Cawood, played by Sarah Lancashire, savagely beaten. As the show ended, she collapsed in the road, her face covered in blood, leaving viewers guessing whether or not she had died. Defending the scenes, the 51-year-old writer, who revealed the BBC also restricts swear words in her scripts, said: 'I actually wanted it to be a lot more violent, but the controller of BBC1 [Charlotte Moore] wanted me to pull the violence in. The show had attracted criticism from its viewers who claimed it had shown 'gratuitous' violence against women . Ms Wainwright  claimed TV viewers are too sensitive to violence against women but never offended by assaults on men . 'And thank God she did … I thought the fuss that was made was ridiculous … violence is horrible, we shouldn't pretend it isn't. It was part of the story – it explains who this man [the attacker] is. He's a psychopath … and it should be awful when we see a woman treated like that. But I don't think it was gratuitous.' She added: 'I find it odd that we often see violence against men and that isn't made an issue of at all.' An average of 7.2 million viewers tuned in to Happy Valley last year and the bleak drama set in West Yorkshire is to return for a second series.","Screenwriter Sally Wainwright defended the latest episode of Happy Valley .

"Attorney General Eric Holder suggested Friday that the Obama administration's opponents have in part staked out their positions because he and the president are black. 'There have been times when I thought that’s at least a piece of it,' he said. But it's 'hard to look into people’s minds, you know, their hearts.' The graceless exit interview will become grist for conservatives who remain convinced that Holder has used race issues to deflect attention from legitimate criticisms. A Politico reporter pressed Holder on whether the White House's detractors were motivated by racial animus, declaring that they were 'more than (on the) fringe.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder suggested America is still cowardly on race – especially Republicans . Conservatives, the outgoing attorney general said, 'use a whole variety of things' to go after the African-American presdient and his top law enforcer. 'You know, ""You weren’t born in this country, you are the 'other'"",' he parroted. 'I mean, you come up with other – you come up with ways in which you try to be effective in your attacks.' 'And certain people have been, you know, less sensitive than they should have been to understand that certain things, given our history,' he said, seemingly invoking America's history of slavery from more than 150 years ago. 'There are certain places that you just shouldn’t – you shouldn’t go.' Holder famously said just days after assuming his office in February 2009 that American had been 'a nation of cowards' on race. 'Race-related issues,' he claimed in a speech, 'continue to occupy a significant portion of our political discussion.' On his way out of the Justice Department, Holder said he would soon call for a change in the standard of proof the agency uses when deciding whether it can prosecute Americans in cases where civil rights abuses are alleged. He plans to make a move before his successor, New York federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch, moves into his office. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved Lynch yesterday, with three Republicans crossing the aisle to vote for her. A full Senate vote will come soon. NO CHARGES: Georeg Zimmerman (left) won't face civicl rights prosecution for killing Trayvon Martin (right), and Holder wants to change the future standard of proof . Changing the civil-rights prosecution standard would make it easier for the DOJ to prosecute Americans like George Zimmerman, the Florida man who shot and killed the unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in 2012. The Obama administration announced this week that it won't move forward on that case since it had 'insufficient evidence to pursue federal criminal civil rights charges.' Holder seemed to regret that outcome. 'I think some serious consideration needs to be given to the standard of proof that has to be met before federal involvement is appropriate, and that’s something that I am going to be talking about before I leave office,' he said. 'I think that if we adjust those standards, we can make the federal government a better backstop – make us more a part of the process in an appropriate way to reassure the American people that decisions are made by people who are really disintereste' in the outcome.","Outgoing attorney general says racism is 'at least a piece of' why so many oppose him and Barack Obama .

"A convicted drug dealer pleaded not guilty Thursday in the 2012 killing a Hollywood film executive whose remains were found in the Southern California desert last year, stating through his attorney that it was self-defense. John Lenzie Creech, 42, entered the plea to a charge of first-degree murder. He could face 25 years to life in state prison if convicted. Outside court, his attorney, Alex Kessel, said that his client was attacked by Gavin Smith in the Chatsworth area of Los Angeles and defended himself, possibly causing a fatal injury.

Case closed: Drug dealer John Lenzie Creech (left), 42, was charged last month with the 2012 murder of 57-year-old Hollywood movie studio executive Gavin Smith (right) Claims of innocence: Creech, 42, entered a not guilty plea Thursday to a charge of first-degree murder in the killing of  Gavin Smith whose remains were discovered in a desert last year . Self-defense: Creech's attorney, Alex Kessel (lefT), said his client was attacked by Smith and defended himself, possibly causing a fatal injury . 'It was total self-defense. It was mutual combat,' Kessel said. Smith, 57, was with Fox's movie distribution department for nearly 18 years and was a branch manager for several theaters. He was also a former UCLA basketball player and had three children. He was last seen the night of May 1, 2012, driving away from the home of a woman friend in eastern Ventura County's Oak Park. His 2000 Mercedes-Benz 420E was found in February 2013 in a storage facility in Simi Valley. Inside the car, investigators found Smith's blood and body tissue, including skin stuck to the car's seat. Smith's remains were discovered by hikers October 26, 2014, in a shallow grave near Palmdale in the Antelope Valley, about 70 miles from where he vanished. The storage facility was linked to Creech, who currently is serving an eight-year jail sentence after pleading no contest in 2012 to an unrelated charge of transporting cocaine for sale. A law enforcement official previously told The Associated Press that Smith was believed to have had a romantic relationship with Creech's wife, Chandrika Creech, after meeting her in drug rehabilitation several years earlier.

Kessel said Thursday that Smith and Creech's wife were in a car together on the night of the fight. 'At one point in time, my client had asked Mr. Smith not to see his wife anymore years before, and he had no idea that his wife had reunited with Mr. Smith,' the attorney said. Smith's wife, Lisa, released a statement Thursday in which she said the evidence will show that 'this was a cold-blooded, premeditated act of murder.' Creech is being held on $1million bail. He is due back in court for a preliminary hearing March 26. Gavin Smith He was declared dead in May of 2014 and a death certificate was issued for him, even though no remains had been found. In November, police said a skull and other bones found by hikers in a shallow grave in the desert east of Los Angeles had been identified as belonging to Smith. Authorities have not said how Smith was killed. Creech has been a longtime person of interest in the Sheriff's Department investigation. The storage facility where Smith's car was found was linked to Creech. Smith was with Fox's movie distribution department for nearly 18 years and was a branch manager for several theaters. He was also known for playing on UCLA's 1975 national championship basketball team. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Nicole Nishida said in November that hikers stumbled across human remains in the area of the Angeles National Forest on October 26, KTLA5 reported. They were later identified as the 57-year-old husband and father of three sons. A cause of death has not yet been determined, as autopsy results were not finasalizedNishida said.

Smith, pictured here with his family, was apparently setting up a home for his mistress and her family . Smith was last seen in May in Ventura County in Los Angeles after leaving a friend's home. His wife, Lisa, reported him missing the following day when he failed to pick up their eldest son, Evan, to take him to school, as he had promised to do. In March last year, police found Smith's black Mercedes Benz 420E at a Simi Valley storage facility that belonged to John Creech. At the time he disappeared, Smith was reportedly having an affair with John Creech's wife, Chandrika Creech, whom he met in drug rehab. John Creech is currently in prison on unrelated drug charges. Frustrated police said that while they had a number of leads in the investigation, they did not have enough evidence to lay charges and the absence of a body was a significant hole in the case.

Gavin and Lisa Smith on their wedding day. At the time of his disappearance, Gavin Smith was in the grip of a mid-life crisis involving drugs and at least two mistresses, Mrs Smith said . Revelations about Smith's double life, which played out in the public eye after his disappearnce, was devastating to his wife and three sons Dylan, Evan and Austin. Shortly after he disappeared, Lisa Smith told MailOnline last year that she felt instinctively that something bad had happened to her husband. 'I think he was murdered,' she said in the interview. 'And I am terrified that whoever did it is going to come after me and our boys.' She said she believed her husband was in the grip of a mid-life crisis that involved drugs and sex with at least three women. Gavin earned $180,000 a year at Fox, distributing hit movies including the Star Wars and Terminator series, Avatar and Titanic. But the couple were struggling to maintain their lavish Hollywood lifestyle and pay the mortgage on their three-bedroom home in the Los Angeles suburb of West Hills. Lisa, an accountant who supported her husband during the early years of their marriage while he struggled as a bit-part actor, discovered he had taken money from his pension fund and squandered his year-end Fox bonus. She also discovered he had a second mistress, named Melanie, in addition to Mrs Chandrika Creech, and he was apparently setting up a home for her and her family. It was then - two weeks before he disappeared - that Lisa Smith threw her husband out of the house. Mrs Smith, in the MailOnline interview, said her husband appeared to be in the grip of a mid-life crisis in the time leading up to his disappearance, talking about buying new cars for his sons and dressing to impress women. 'In hindsight, all the signs were there. He was dressing like a 20-year-old to go to drug rehab meetings and working out like mad,' she said. She said Fox stopped paying her husband's salary two months after he disappeared and cleared out his office. Staff left several cardboard boxes of personal items, including framed family photos and golf trophies, on Lisa’s front porch.

"Jihadi John's 19-year-old sister, whom MailOnline has decided not to identify, produced a short film about a hooded serial killer for her coursework . Jihadi John's younger sister produced a short film about a hooded serial killer chasing a schoolgirl as part of her A-level coursework, it has emerged. The 19-year-old is now a media student at Middlesex University while the pair's brother, now 21, is a small-time criminal with hardline and outspoken Islamist views. The masked Islamic State executioner, known as Jihadi John, was yesterday named as Mohammed Emwazi, a Westminster University graduate from West London. His 19-year-old sister, like Emwazi, went to Quintin Kynaston school where she was a prefect and studied cinematography at A-Level. Her film called 'The Killer's Footsteps', which depicted a dead schoolgirl, bloodied footsteps and a hooded maniac brandishing a knife, was made as part of her school coursework and contained themes about bullying. The 19-year-old, whom MailOnline has decided not to identify, described the film as representing 'a dangerous, shocking criminal who is a serial killer.' But she said the film teaches the audience that 'revenge is never the right answer.' In her description of the short film, she said: 'We showed and represented this killer by hiding this person under a hoodies, in dark or very dim light to create a mysterious atmosphere throughout the film. 'By doing this we are able to play with the audiences mid a bit, and show them that the fact this killer can be anyone...But who? 'This killer can be a friend, family member, teacher, or in fact someone they have never meet before. However, the killer knows the protagonist and has been watching the protagonist.' 'The representation gives out a hidden message about how bullying is wrong, how we humans shouldn't stereotype people and pick on them because for what background they come from or the colour of their skin nor what they believe in.' The 19-year-old media student's short film showed a young woman lying dead on the floor . The identity of the masked Islamic State executioner, known as Jihadi John (right), was yesterday revealed as Mohammed Emwazi, a Westminster University graduate, pictured (left) at primary school in west London . Emwazi’s brother, whom the Mail had decided not to name, is a member of the Woolwich Dawah group, which was also attended by the men convicted of Lee Rigby's killing. The university graduate, who like his sibling has taken a keen interest in computer networks, listens to the teachings of radical preacher Khalid Yasin, according to reports. Several of his friends use images similar to those used by extremists online and last night at least one of his 68 friends on Facebook was displaying the black flag of Islamic State. He has also commented on videos, supporting one in which a woman is mocked for praying in a clumsy manner. Her film, a 'thriller' depicting a hooded man chasing a girl through a school, was made as part of her coursework . She described the short film as representing 'a dangerous, shocking criminal who is a serial killer' He has at least two convictions, for handling a stolen police bicycle and a string of thefts at a shopping village - and has twice been hauled back for repeated breaches of community orders. In 1996 the family moved to a three-bedroomed first floor flat in Warwick Crescent. From there they moved to a run-down terrace in nearby Desborough Close, surrounded by council blocks. Emwazi lived with his family at this small house for four years until 2002, the year his youngest sibling was born. While Mohammed was at school his family moved again, this time to a flat near Lord’s cricket ground, where they remained until 2005.

"The boss of Network Rail has announced a radical plan to make the trains run on time - fast-track more women recruits. Chief executive Mark Carne has declared war on the 'macho-culture' of the rail industry and unveiled a blueprint to more than double to one in 3, the proportion of female staff employed by his firm which runs the nations rail tracks. At the current recruitment rates that would take 65 years. So radical action is needed now, he said. The culture change was necessary to address the chronic failures and 'institutional incompetence' of the recent past, for which he apologised. Mark Carne, the boss of Network Rail, has declared war on the 'macho-culture' of the rail industry . He said the vital woman's touch was needed to rid the railways of a reputation for 'stale sandwiches, leaves on the line, and the wrong kind of snow', to show a more caring face to passengers, and to end Network Rail's own image as 'the company that people love to hate'. The former oil industry boss who was once responsible for Shell's North Sea fields, told rail industry chiefs he had seen first-hand the degree to which more women employees had 'transformed' the macho culture there and wanted to repeat the lesson on the railways. But it prompted one former Transport Secretary to describe Mr Carne's frank appraisal - following the Christmas chaos at Kings Cross and Paddington - as 'a systematic hatchet job' of the current Network Rail culture. Currently just one in seven of Network Rail's 35,000 staff – or around 5,000 employees in total – are women. But he want to increase that to around one in three – from trackside engineers to office support staff. Mr Carne said: 'Today women make up only 14 per cent of the Network Rail workforce. It is hardly surprising that under such circumstances we still have what many would describe as a macho-culture within the company.' Currently just one in seven of Network Rail's 35,000 staff – or around 5,000 employees in total – are women . He added: 'And to make matters worse, at the current rate that the numbers of women in our business are increasing, it will take another 65 years before we reach 30 per cent – a level which is seen as a tipping point for organisations looking to benefit from gender diversity.' He was a strong advocate of 'positive action' to recruit and promote more women but stressed: 'This is not the same as positive discrimination, but it does recognise that if you do not take some action to compensate for the inherent biases that must exist, the bad habits that have persisted in the past will carry on in the future.' He said any woman with the necessary qualifications for a job will in future be automatically offered an interview for it. But only the best candidate – regardless of gender – would be recruited, he insisted. More women would also help reduce the 'appalling tragedies' and 600 serious injuries on the railways each year because female employees were less 'macho', he said: 'When women started becoming a much more visible presence on the oil and gas platforms in the North Sea twenty years ago, the difference they brought was profound. 'The extreme macho, and frankly unsafe, culture that was a hallmark of the industry in the 1970s and 1980s changed dramatically and forever.' Mr Carne said: 'Diversity and inclusion aren't just nice-to-haves. It's not political correctness. They are powerful tools to help any organisation improve its performance.' He said Network Rail had to get back to basics noting: 'Too often we have allowed the basics to be forgotten as we divert the organisation onto yet another fad or initiative.' Mr Carne, who has waived a bonus and reduced the amount that directors can earn above their basic salary, attacked the bonus culture and the previous 'incomprehensible' company incentive scheme which he said has now been reformed. He noted: 'Sometimes we let passengers down. I don't think that's acceptable or just a fact of life. And I understand their frustration and their anger.' 'Reputations are hard won and easily lost. Anecdotes can quickly become a short-cut to characterise more general institutional incompetence. 'Stale sandwiches, leaves on the line, the wrong kind of snow. These have entered the lexicon of public conversations about the railway over the last 30 years.' The railway's poor reputation left staff 'being ridiculed by friends and family.' He added: 'If we are to stop being the company that people love to hate, the public needs to see a high performing organisation, but crucially one that demonstrably cares about passengers.' Former Labour Transport Secretary Lord Adonis who compered the event at the Institute of Engineers in Westminster said Mr Carne's speech smacked of 'a systematic hatchet job' of the current Network Rail culture adding: 'I don't think I've ever heard a CEO be so critical of his own company.'","Network Rail boss has declared war on the rail industry's 'macho-culture'

"Food and energy costs may be falling... but there’s one price rise we just can’t seem to stamp out. Royal Mail has announced that sending a letter is going to be a penny more expensive from next month. The company, which was privatised in 2013, is bumping up the cost of a first class stamp from 62p to 63p, while second class is rising from 53p to 54p. Both changes come into effect on March 30. Price hike: Royal Mail is to increase the price of first and second class stamps by 1p each to 63p and 54p from March 30 . Royal Mail said it ‘thought carefully about the impact on customers’ before raising the price of posting a letter. ‘We recognise how difficult it has been for householders and businesses in the recent tough economic conditions,’ it said. Critics said the increase will hit small businesses in particular as they often rely heavily on the postal service. The price increase amounts to 1.6 per cent for a first class stamp, and 1.9 per cent for second class – above the official inflation rate of 0.3 per cent. The price of stamps has more than doubled in the last ten years. John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘If you’re a business that relies heavily on the postal service, increases in stamp prices won’t be welcomed. ‘While prices have only gone up by a penny, this still represents an above inflation rise. Businesses affected will still have to decide whether to absorb this rise or pass it on to their customers.’ Consolation: Royal Mail also announced that it is simplifying and cutting the price of sending a second-class medium parcel . Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ‘Royal Mail needs to focus on making efficiency savings rather than relying on raising prices. Consumers will want to see a fair balance between Royal Mail raising prices and saving money by being a more efficient organisation.’ Royal Mail insisted its prices ‘remain among the best value in Europe’. It also said the price of sending a medium-sized parcel weighing up to 2kg second class will be cut by as much as £3.11 to £4.89. Mr Allan added: ‘Those businesses that send large numbers of packages will appreciate the lower charges for parcels below 2kg.’ Royal Mail has previously warned that it will be forced to raise prices if private delivery services are not brought under control. Last year it said the growth of private firms ‘could threaten the economics of the universal service’.","Sending a large letter will increase by 2p to 95p for first class service .

"She can't sit up on her own and she certainly isn't swinging fearlessly through the trees just yet. But right now the only thing Rieke the baby orangutan wants is a mum. She was abandoned at birth six weeks ago when her 11-year-old mother rejected her. Now, like any young orphan, she is looking for a grown-up to adopt her. In different circumstances, Rieke would be spending her formative months clinging to her mother and learning the ways of an orangutan tribe. Scroll down for video . Abandoned: Six-week-old Rieke (pictured) was rejected by her 11-year-old mother at birth . New hope: She is now being transferred to Monkey World in Dorset that houses a tribe of 18 orangutans - one of which could become Rieke's new mother . Instead, she has spent all her short life being cared for by humans. Like any baby, she needs her nappy changing, suckles from a bottle and makes squeaking noises when she wants attention. She even has a snuggly blanket to comfort her. But it's no substitute for a mother's love. Four keepers at Monkey World in Dorset take it in turns to look after her so she doesn't get attached to just one of them. Soon, however, she will be introduced to adult orangutans in the hope that she can find a family – and someone to ape. Rieke was moved on Monday to the sanctuary from Berlin Zoo, where she was born on January 12 weighing just 4lb. She slept for most of the 17-hour journey, a feat few children could manage without whining: 'Are we nearly there yet?' Rehomed: Rieke was moved to Monkey World  from Berlin Zoo where she was born on January 12 weighing just 4lb . Endangered: Orangutans are considered the most intelligent of all ape species but some experts believe they could go extinct within 25 years . The zoo wanted her to grow up in as natural an environment as possible – and Monkey World already cares for a tribe of 18 orangutans, one of which, it is hoped, will become her stepmother. Crucially, there is also another orangutan orphan there to play with – Bulu Mata, a five-month-old whose mother died after giving birth to him at a zoo in Budapest. Yesterday the pair were said to be bonding perfectly. Having a big brother to show her the ropes will be a huge advantage in Rieke's development. Orangutans are the most intelligent great apes and are critically endangered in their Indonesian homelands – some experts believe the species could be extinct within 25 years. Monkey World, set up in 1987, currently has 250 rescued primates from 20 species... plus one little girl that just wants to be loved.","Six-week-old orangutan Rieke rejected by her 11-year-old mother at birth .

"More than 250 people have died in a series of avalanches across Afghanistan, following days of heavy snowfalls. The death toll is expected to rise overnight as cold weather and difficult conditions are hampering rescue efforts, relief workers and U.N. officials said Friday. Hundreds have been left homeless after avalanches destroyed their villages, and many more remained cut off from help as roads were blocked by deep snow. Aftermath: Survivors wait to receive food donations near the site of an avalanche in the Paryan district of Panjshir province, north of Kabul, Afghanistan . Destruction: Afghans stand on the roof of a home damaged by an avalanche in the Paryan district of Panjshir province, as the death toll was reported to have increased to at least 260 people . Cut off: The Panjshir province (pictured) has been worst hit by the avalanches, with 186 people killed and hundreds left homeless . The U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reports 229 dead in 18 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, while reports from local sources claim at least 260 people are dead. The bulk of the deaths have come in Panjshir province, 60 miles northeast of the capital Kabu, where at least 186 people were killed, acting provincial governor Abdul Rahman Kabiri said. Army helicopters are distributing supplies to people in areas of Panjshir as it is still unreachable by road. 'Helicopters are dropping medicines, blankets and other necessary items to remote areas of Panjshir,' Mohammad Aslam Syas, deputy chief of the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority, said . Elsewhere in Afghanistan, 36 died in the remote northeastern province of Badakhshan, five in northern Baghlan, five in Parwan and 12 in Nuristan and Kunar provinces in the east, and five in western Badghis.

Afghans take cover from snow blowing after an avalanche in Panjshir province, north of Kabul . Six were killed in the central province of Bamiyan, four in Laghman and one in Nangarhar, both in the east - bringing the total toll to at least 260. Extremely cold temperatures were expected in many parts of the country in coming days, OCHA said. Officials said the harsh conditions and lack of machinery were hampering efforts to reach people trapped, injured or dead. The army and some international agencies were delivering food, medicines, clothing and shelter to some of the hardest-hit areas, including far northern Badakhshan and Panjshir in the northeast. Casualties are expected to climb as agencies reach the remote avalanche and flood-hit areas. The Salang Tunnel, which links Kabul to northern Afghanistan, remained closed, and power supplies in the capital were intermittent. Afghanistan has suffered through some three decades of war since the Soviet invasion in 1979. But natural disasters such as landslides, floods and avalanches have also taken a heavy toll on a country with little infrastructure or development outside of its major cities. In May, a massive landslide killed anywhere from 250 to 2,700 people, authorities said at the time. Another landslide in 2012 killed 71 people. Authorities were not able to recover the vast majority of bodies and ended up declaring the site a mass grave.","At least 260 people have died in avalanches across Afghanistan .

"Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has been caught resting her eyes in the middle of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's speech in New Zealand. Ms Bishop reportedly caught a flight from Canberra late on Thursday night to attend the annual Australia-New Zealand leaders' meeting. She arrived in Auckland at about 1am, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. It is believed she was up bright and early for her usual 6am morning jog on Friday, meaning she just had about five hours sleep - if not less - before attending a leadership forum with Mr Abbott. This comes  after speculation over another leadership challenge against Mr Abbott where Malcolm Turnbull has reportedly been told by backbenchers that he has the numbers for a successful spill. Since those reports emerged on Seven News yesterday, supporters of Ms Bishop also claimed the Foreign Affairs Minister was against the move and would stand against Mr Turnbull if it was to go ahead.

Ms Bishop (left) and Mr Abbott (right) are in New Zealand for the annual Australia-New Zealand leaders' meeting . As Mr Abbott addressed the forum, which was also attended by New Zealand Prime Minister John Keys, Ms Bishop's eyelids were closed for a moment or two. Her head also dropped briefly before she woke up again, The Sydney Morning Herald reports. When asked about Ms Bishop's nap during the speech, Mr Abbott said 'given the pace at which we all work, its absolutely understandable'. 'I've dozed off from time to time at conferences, all of us have from time to time dozed off at conferences,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald. It appears Ms Bishop's tight schedule, including her strict exercise routine, is finally catching up on her. Earlier in the week, Ms Bishop was also seen making tracks to Parliament House in Canberra. However Ms Bishop denied nodding off during Mr Abbott's speech on Friday, tweeting that she was: 'Not sleeping merely contemplating the media obsession with trivia'.

"Men accused of date rape must be quizzed by police over the ‘steps they took’ to establish that a woman agreed to sex, the country’s top prosecutor said yesterday. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said detectives should question a suspect about ‘what assured him’ the alleged victim had consented. New guidelines would guarantee a ‘more balanced consideration’ of the accounts of both the suspect and the alleged victim, she said. Director of Public Prosecutors, pictured, said she wants police to question date-rape suspects over what measures they took to make sure that any sexual contact was consensual between all parties . During a keynote speech in Manchester yesterday, she said: ‘The law states that if a suspect can show that they had reasonable belief that the other party consented then the offence of rape is not made out. ‘Logic dictates that in order to establish what the suspect’s reasonable belief might be then investigators will want to question the suspect on what it was that assured him the sexual activity was consensual. ‘The new toolkits on consent make this clear, highlighting that when considering consent issues, in addition to examining the actions of the complainant, we will also examine the steps taken by a suspect.’ Mrs Saunders spoke out in the wake of the furore over footballer Ched Evans, who was released from prison in October halfway through a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in a Welsh hotel. The player has always professed his innocence, saying the sex was consensual, but the woman said she was too drunk to agree. Last month Mrs Saunders announced a major shake-up of investigations into sex offences and spelled out situations where victims would not be in a position to agree to sex, such as if they were incapacitated through alcohol or drugs or were unconscious or had mental health problems or learning difficulties. At a special conference, she said new guidelines would for the first time move well beyond the idea of ‘no means no’. Campaigners described the move as a ‘huge step forward’ in ensuring fewer rapists escaped justice. But critics said the measures threatened to shift the burden of proof by moving towards making rape suspects prove they were innocent. Ms Saunders was speaking in the aftermath of the scandal involving shamed footballer Ched Evans, pictured, who was jailed for raping a 19-year-old woman in a Welsh hotel room . Tory MP Philip Davies said at the time: ‘It is not clear how anyone is supposed to prove that consent was given. Is the CPS really suggesting that you have to get a signed statement off someone before they have sex?’ But, defending the guidelines yesterday, Mrs Saunders insisted she had ‘welcomed’ the furious debate, adding: ‘If the law had changed and the burden of proof for sexual offences now lay with the alleged offender to prove his or her innocence, I would have been among the first to stand up and oppose such a move. ‘I would have agreed that to imply that people must get a time-stamped signature on a bedroom contract before disrobing was not only misguided but utterly unrealistic.’ She also hit out at the findings of research by the Office for National Statistics earlier this month which showed a quarter of the public say that victims of rape or sex attacks are at least ‘a little bit responsible’ if they were drunk at the time. She said: ‘There are many people who do believe that women who drink are guilty of, at the very least, putting themselves in danger; that a man has a green light to sex unless he is explicitly told “no” or physically pushed away. That is not what the law says.","DPP Alison Saunders wants a 'balanced consideration' of both accounts .

"It would appear that Spring has finally sprung with thousands of people across the UK enjoying the sunshine as the Met Office has announced this winter has been the sunniest  in records dating back nearly 90 years. While Britain has experienced fairly average temperatures and rainfall - unlike last winter which was the wettest on record - 2015 is on track to be the sunniest since 1929. By February 25, with three days left to go of the meteorological winter, the UK had already seen 189 hours of sunshine, equalling the previous record year in 2001.

The crocuses blooming in Duthie Park, Aberdeen - the UK has already seen more than 189 hours of sunshine so far this year . The Met Office predicts that with sunshine in the last three days of winter, the UK is likely to beat the record by seven hours. Unlike last year's wet and stormy winter, the season this year has recorded just 8 per cent more rainfall than the long term average, with 375 mm (14.8in) of rain across the UK, with the southern, eastern and north eastern areas of England drier than usual. But in Scotland the winter has been one of the top 10 wettest in records dating back to 1910, the Met Office said. Despite being so wet and stormy, many areas in winter 2014 also had above average sunshine, the weather experts said, because the storms brought rain in short, sharp bursts, often overnight, leaving plenty of time for sunshine in between.

This year, winter temperatures are expected to be slightly above average, at 3.8C, compared to the long term average of 3.7C. But it was much less warm than last winter when temperatures averaged 5.2C, beginning what became the UK's hottest year on record. Early figures for February from the Met Office suggest the month was drier than average and likely to be slightly cooler than average. But it was notably mild on February 18, with 15.6C, recorded at Fyvie Castle, Aberdeenshire. In a statement the Met Office said: 'The month showed the variety of winter weather we can get in the UK - the first half of the month being dominated by high pressure, bringing mostly dry and settled and cold weather, while the second half of the month was more unsettled with westerly winds bringing Atlantic frontal systems.'

The first day of March on Sunday is set to be another windy day across the country, with outbreaks of rain, particularly in the North West. The afternoon is set to be brighter, with slightly cooler temperatures of 6 to 8C.

"Brady Brunch star Barry Williams has been accused of abandoning his three-year-old daughter and leaving his girlfriend of seven years 'homeless and destitute'. Elizabeth Kennedy says the actor, who played Greg Brady in the ABC series, only spent eight hours with his daughter throughout 2014 and allowed them to be evicted two weeks before Christmas. The 60-year-old left his ex-girlfriend in 2011 and moved from Hollywood to Branson, Missouri, to pursue a career in entertainment. Scroll down for video . Allegations: Elizabeth Kennedy (far left) says Barry Williams, who played Greg Brady in the ABC series, only spent eight hours with his daughter throughout 2014 and allowed them to be evicted just before Christmas . His flagging stage career is now the subject of his own reality series: 'A Very Barry Branson'. In court papers seen by Inside Edition, Williams says Kennedy got pregnant on purpose when he refused to marry her and insists she was nothing more than a 'sexual companion'. In a recent interview with Huffington Post, he described her as a 'playmate'. A devastated Kennedy told Inside Edition's Jim Moret: 'It's the most hurtful thing that anybody's ever done.' He then asks her: 'If you could say anything, what would you say to him?' She replied: 'That he should be ashamed of himself.' Career: The star, pictured during a Brady Bunch episode from 1972, has recently moved to Missouri to pursue a career in entertainment. He is now the subject of his own reality series 'A Very Barry Branson' A source close to Williams told the program the star thinks the claims are nonsense. In a Huffington Post interview on February 5, Williams described his time on the Brady Bunch and caused controversy when he suggested he would consider going transgender for publicity. He said: 'We don't have time for all of that rigamarole and sorting it out. I want to find out if Bruce Jenner is going to become a woman or not. 'That guy is committed. He is committed to promoting himself. And I'm thinking, maybe, I don't know, I could say - I'm just saying, if this thing doesn't work, and the series isn't doing as well as I want, I'm going transgender.' The sitcom originally aired from September 26, 1969, and finished on March 8, 1974, on ABC. He was married to Diane Martin between 1990 and 1992 before he tied the knot with Eila Mary Matt. The pair had had a child, Brandon Eric Williams in 2004, but split a year later. Following the cancellation of The Brady Bunch in 1974, Williams continued to appear in guest roles on television, and became involved in musical theater, touring with productions such as Grease, The Sound of Music, and West Side Story.

"Some people use the Snapchat app for exchanging suggestive pictures of themselves, as pictured . The photo sharing app Snapchat has released a list of rules on their website for underage users, that includes strict instructions for teenagers to keep their clothes on. Staff at the organisation have also released a guide for parents in order to alleviate fears over teenagers using the technology for sexting. The six-page manual to teach adults about how to use the technology and to reassure them about the safety features installed. The list of things NOT to be done on the site include pornography, nudity for those under 18, threats, impersonation and self-harm. It follows up with: 'Don’t use Snapchat for any illegal shenanigans and if you’re under 18 or are Snapping with someone who might be: keep your clothes on!' In the separate section for parents, staff seek to explain why children like to use the app so much, saying: 'It's been (rightfully) drummed into their heads for years that photos and videos you share are on the Web forever and are really hard to take back, so Snapchat's a relief in a lot of ways.' Snapchat is incredibly popular among 13 to 25 year olds, but the technology has been hit with bad publicity since its inception for the amount of young people who use it to exchange sexy pictures. In the new guide, Snapchat reveals that the majority of people using the app don't exchange x-rated images. Many parents are concerned that their children are using Snapchat for inappropriate reasons (Picture posed by models) Addressing concerned parents, the writer says: 'Though there's nothing inherently dangerous about Snapchat, early news coverage fairly predictably associated disappearing photos sent on phones with ""sexting."" 'Many assume Snapchat's biggest draw is the temporary nature of its messages, which encourages people to share racy images without worrying about the repercussions. 'But most people – including most teens -- don’t use Snapchat that way. They use it because it’s fun.' Snapchat have launched a new guide for parents to help alleviate any concerns they have about the app . It goes on to offer helpful tips for parents to pass on to their children about the type of things to bear in mind when sending a picture to a friend. They include: 'Be nice – it really helps. Just as in physical settings, people generally react, interact and share things in a friendly way on Snapchat too. '[Know] who to share with - Snapchat was originally designed for sharing with friends in ""real life"" – or at least people in your phone contacts. 'Context is key - a positive experience on Snapchat truly depends on the situation being Snapped and the relationship you have with the friends you're sharing with.' The new guide teaches parents about how to use Snapchat (Picture posed by models) It finishes by comparing teaching your children how to use Snapchat with helping them learn how to swim. The pamphlet says: 'There’s no need to panic every time you hear a media report about something awful happening in social media. 'The reason the news media cover awful situations is because they’re rare. 'How often do you see headlines about planes landing safely? We only hear about the ones that crash. 'Of course kids can get into trouble using Snapchat or any other service, but the same can be said for swimming pools. That’s why we teach them how to swim.'","Snapchat has released a list of rules on its website for teens .

"A British jihadist from Coventry, nicknamed Osama bin Bieber, has been left disabled whilst fighting for Islamic State in Iraq. According to a source close to his family, Hadi told his father in late December that he had suffered ‘serious spinal injuries’ and was now completely deaf in one ear. He has been recovering in Mosul hospital but it remains unknown whether he will be fit enough to ever fight again. Teen terrorist: Mohammed Hadi,19, left his home in Coventry to join ISIS in March 2014. Hadi was nicknamed ‘Osama bin Bieber’ by social media users due to his boyish looks and spindly physique. Prior to his injuries, the 19 year old had reportedly been used by Islamic State as a police officer in Mosul. Islamic State police are responsible for arresting and punishing anyone who does not adhere to the group’s twisted interpretation of radical Shariah law. Fluent in Kurdish, Arabic and English, Hadi used his language skills to interrogate suspects and was considered an important assetto ISIS police force. Hadi had also been active on social media, where he frequently urged British Muslims to join ISIS and carry out acts of terror against 'non believers'. The Coventry Trio: Hadi travelled with school friends Ali Kalantar and Rashid Amani to Syria after reportedly being radicalised by a local imam. Prior to his injuries, the 19 year old had reportedly been used by Islamic State as a police officer in Mosul. Fluent in Kurdish, Arabic and English, his language skills meant he was able to interrogate prisoners. Hadi travelled along with school friends Ali Kalantar and Rashid Amani after being radicalised by a local imam. Flying to Turkey, the three friends crossed over the Turkish-Syrian border and joined Islamic State in March 2014. However after completing basic training in Syria, Hadi left his two friends in Manbij and travelled with Islamic State for deployment in the Iraqi city of Mosul. He regularly posted photos  of the ISIS held city on his private social media account until he  sustained his injuries last December. Rashid Amani was known as Abu Massoud al-Khurasani whilst fighting for ISIS. Like Kalanter, he was of Afghan origin and had moved to the UK with his family when he was young. Terror training: Ali Kalanter (pictured in blue t-shirt) once wrote on social media that his British passport 'had less value than toilet tissue paper' Hadi’s mother has previously stated that her son must have been financially assisted by someone in order to go to Syria as she only gave him £14 per week as pocket money. Hadi is the last suriving member of the Coventry trio following the death of his best friends Ali Kalantar and Rashid Amani last year. 19 year old Ali Kalanter was the first of the friends to be killed in battle. Known by his nom de guerre Ali al-Farsi, Kalanter was shot dead whilst taking part in an offensive near Tikrit University on 4 December 2014. His death was announced by his widow, Zahra Halane, one of the ‘terror twins’ from Manchester. Describing him as ‘a blessing from Allah’, the 17 year old British Somali jihadist tweeted that she hoped ‘to join him very soon.’ Prior to joining Islamic State, Kalanter dreamt of being a model and was planning to study computer science at Coventry University. Terror Twin's tribute: Ali Kalatner's death was announced by his widow, Zahra Halane, one of the ‘terror twins’ from Manchester. They lived together in the Syrian city of Manbij. Model dreams: Prior to joining Islamic State, Kalanter dreamt of being a model and was planning to study computer science at Coventry University. Teamates: Rashid Amani and Ali Kalanter played football together when they were at Barr Hill's School. Amani had been studying for a business degree at Coventry University before he joined ISIS . Kalanter was born in Afghanistan but grew up in Coventry after his family moved over to the UK when he was five years old. He attended the Barr Hill's School with fellow British Afghan Rashid Amani, where they both played football for the school team. Rashid Amani was killed by an US air strike whilst fighting at Kobane. Known as Abu Massoud al-Khurassani, Amani was unmarried but had been living with Kalanter and Halane in Manbij. The 19 year old had been studying for a business degree at Coventry University before he joined ISIS.","Mohammed Hadi, 19, told his dad that he suffered 'serious spinal injuries' and lost the hearing in one ear .

"Nigel Farage flew half way round the world to address America's leading conservative conference last night - but hardly anyone turned up to listen. The Ukip leader flew to Washington to address the gathering of hardcore activists before catching a ‘red eye’ flight home overnight to get back in time for this afternoon's Ukip conference in Margate. But Mr Farage was handed the 'graveyard' speaking slot at the end of the day and was forced to address an audience of just 250 in a convention centre with a capacity for over 5,000. Nigel Farage flew to Washington to address America's leading conservative conference - but hardly anyone showed up to listen . Mr Farage delivered his speech to row after row of empty chairs just an hour after the hall had been packed for a speech by Sarah Palin, the darling of Tea Party conservatives. The Conservative Political Action Conference is an annual three-day mecca for Tea Party campaigners, anti-abortion opponents and gun rights activists. Mr Farage warned the Republican gathering that they risked becoming dinosaurs like the Conservatives in the UK if they continued to embrace the political centre. Mr Farage slammed David Cameron over his failure to identify the infamous ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John.' 'Of course they should have told us his name,' he said. 'We should have heard it weeks ago. This information's been known for a long time.' He also claimed the name was leaked to cover yesterday's immigration figures. 'By sheer coincidence,' he said, Emwazi's name was published 'on the day when the government has to announce the worst immigration figures ever seen in the history of the United Kingdom.' 'WE'RE NOT THE TEA PARTY': Nigel Farage, whose UK Independence Party is challenging both Tories and Liberals, said his is a real political force, not just an influence group trying to reform a wayward party . He also hit out against CAGE, the British NGO that often advocates on behalf of radicalized Muslims and brands their detractors 'Islamophobes.' 'Yes, yes, yes!' Farage exploded when asked if the group was an embarrassment to most Britons. 'It's politcal correctness! 'I mean, we see protests on a regular basis with these groups on the streets of London saying and shouting things that – if you and I did them, we'd find ourselves behind bars in very short order.' 'We actually have a Judeo-Christian culture,' he added. 'It's actually in our Constitution, so let's stand up for it.' Is that xenophobic? Farage doesn't think so. 'The thing about us,' he said of the UK, 'is that we have been, of all the European countries, the most tolerant of all different religions and all different groups who have come to Britain.' While 'private observance' of any religion 'is fine,' he insisted, 'unless we live under one law we're in trouble.' The Conservative Political Action Conference brings all manner of right-wingers to a hotel in Maryland each year . Mr Farage said the Republican Party was 'going through the same crisis of identity as the Conservative Party in Britain'. Ukip, he boasted, was 'an insurgent political force that has taken on the political establishment and rocked them to the backs of their heels.' But he said: 'We're not the tea party. Our job is not to influence one political party. We're not an outlier from the Tories.' And unlike the tea party phenomenon, which peels off disaffected Republicans who believe their traditional party has moved too far left, he said, his group 'is not just retired half-colonels who've always voted Conservative and now they're UKIP. We're dragging them from across the spectrum.' Mr Farage also attacked Mr Obama - claiming he sees 'an American president who doesn't have the courage' to fight against Islamist terror. Mr Obama, he claimed, lacks the vision to see 'what has gone wrong, and why those three people were arrested on the streets of the USA yesterday.' That was a reference to the trio of Muslim men who were detained by the FBI after they began the process of traveling to Syria for training with the ISIS terror army – with the intention of bringing death and destruction back to America. 'We must stand firm and defend our Judeo-Christian culture,' Farage said, earnign his first boisterous applause. 'We must make it clear that we believe in common law and not Shariah law.' He called radical Islam 'an enemy within' both the US and the UK. Farage said 'the Republican Party is going through the same crisis of identity as the Conservative Party in Britain' 'If you discuss immigration, it means you're a bad person,' he complained to a thousand convention-goers – 'that you harbor dislike or hatred or prejudice of somebody else' CPAC's lineup includes Sarah Palin, whose teleprompter played tricks on her last month in Iowa, leaving her rambling for minutes . The CPAC conference draws conservatives from all over the US, but they share the same message . Like any political force testing its boundaries by casting a wide net, it would be recognizable to American conservatives who have had to contend with their own brand of bad publicity. Todd Akin, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, famously self-imploded after musing on whether abortions should be allowed in cases of 'legitimate rape.' Sarah Palin just last month lost track of her teleprompter during a key Iowa speech and rambled aimlessly for what seemed like hours, causing some to wonder if she was intoxicated. An ocean away, UKIP councillor Rozanne Duncan was kicked out this month after she was filmed saying she has 'a problem with people with negroid features.' And social media accounts belonging to UKIP activist Richard Crouch were plastered recently with claims that his home town of Leicester is a 'sh*thole' and 'full of P***s.' His Facebook account called Asians 'The Taliban' and labeled Romanians 'pick pocketing criminals.' Crouch insisted that his account was hacked, but the damage was done. Farage threw up his hands and suggested that idiots will be idiots. 'Well, look,' he told Daily Mail Online, 'people like Rozanne Duncan are local councillors. They are very low-level people in UKIP. They're not major players.' 'Yes, we get people who say stupid things in UKIP. I don't approve or condone any of it.'","Nigel Farage flew to Washington to address a conservative conference .

"Parents have expressed their outrage at how a six-year-old boy was forced to eat his school lunch alone behind a screen  after his parents dropped him off late. Lincoln Elementary School in Grants Pass, Oregon has been forced to change its tardiness policy after an image of the punishment was shared thousands of times on Facebook - sparking hundreds of complaints. In the photograph, Hunter Cmelo, a first grader at the school, can be seen sitting alone behind a cardboard divider at a cafeteria table. Close by is a cup with a large letter 'D' for 'detention'. His grandmother, Laura Hoover, shared the image to her Facebook page on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Alone: Six-year-old Hunter Cmelo was forced to eat alone behind this cardboard divider after his parents dropped him off late to his elementary school. He was left feeling humiliated, his family said . Embarrassed: The school district said that the system is supposed to give children the chance to catch up on work they have missed by being late - but staff have now agreed to stop using the screen . 'This is my grandson, Hunter. He's a little first grader,' she wrote. 'His momma's car sometimes doesn't like to start right up. Sometimes he's a couple of minutes late to school. 'Yesterday, he was 1 minute late and this is what his momma discovered they do to punish him! They have done this to him 6 times for something that is out of his control! They make a mockery of him in front of the other students.' She said that his mother found Hunter crying and took him home. His parents said they were devastated when they found out what their son was going through. 'They are shaming him for something that's not in his control,' his father, Mark Cmelo, told KOIN6. 'It is our fault that he is late.' His mother, Nicole Garloff, said the punishment has left her son anxious about going to school, and that a few days ago, he began 'flipping out' because they were running late. She said that she has experienced car troubles and suffers from osteoporosis, which can set her back in the mornings. 'It causes a lot of pain and in the mornings it's especially hard for me to get going,' she said. Hunter is pictured with his mother, Nicole Garloff, who admitted he is often late to school due to car troubles and because she suffers from osteoporosis, which makes it hard for her to get going in the morning . School: The principal of Lincoln Elementary School in Grants Pass, Oregon has now met with the boy's parents and reached 'an appropriate resolution', the district said . The boy is unable to ride the school bus because they live within a mile of the school, but they are unable to walk because the road is too busy. School superintendent John Higgins and principal Missy Fitzsimmons started receiving threatening calls after the photo was shared on Facebook, according to Newswatch 12. Higgins told the channel he believes the system gave students a chance to catch up on missed work. The 'protocol was communicated to parents via newsletter and is intended to provide the students with an above average level of tardiness, supervised additional learning time in a non-distracting setting,' the district said in a statement. 'It was never intended to isolate or stigmatize students.' The principal immediately reached out to the parents after receiving complaints. They met on Thursday and agreed to stop using the partition as a punishment. 'We are pleased to report the meeting was productive,' the district said. 'The parents' concerns were politely discussed and, ultimately, the issues were resolved to the satisfaction of both parents and the school. All parties involved believe that an appropriate resolution has been reached.","First-grader Hunter Cmelo was forced to sit alone behind a cardboard divider to eat his lunch after he was late to school in Grants Pass, Oregon .

"Found? A car belonging to missing teacher Lisa Hayden-Gordon, 51, has been found in a Florida river . A car belonging to a missing Florida music teacher has been found submerged in a river more than a month after she vanished following a night out. Police have said that a body was found inside the car but have not yet confirmed if it belongs to Lisa Hayden-Gordon,  CBS reported. The 51-year-old piano instructor went missing after watching a concert with friends on January 24. The vehicle was found submerged in the New River near Cooley's Landing Marina in Fort Lauderdale on Friday and teams pulled it out from the water. The body will now be taken to the medical examiner's office for processing. Hayden-Gordon had gone out with a man she met online and several of her friends, and they attended a Keller Williams show at Revolution Live in Fort Lauderdale. The group  wanted to take her home because they thought she had had too much to drink, but she went to the restroom at a bar, the Poorhouse, and never returned. They looked for her but when they could not find her anywhere, they ended up leaving, and she has not been seen since. A friend told CBS that people had seen Hayden  walking away from a bar with her keys in her hand the night she went missing. 'Everybody who saw her that night said that she was so happy and having just a good time,' her sister Tara Cloe previously told the Sun Sentinel. 'She's always singing, she was probably singing the whole time during the concert. And then she left.' Discovery: The distinctive blue 2003 Hyundai Elantra, pictured, was found near a Fort Lauderdale marina on Friday morning - more than a month after she vanished during a night out with friends . Police admitted two weeks ago that they had few leads. 'We do not believe that she voluntarily left the area,' police spokeswoman DeAnna Greenlaw said. 'We do not know if possibly she was involved in some type of crash or an accident when she did leave the downtown area. We don't know if she met up with someone. There's a lot of unknowns right now. 'We are basically exhausting our resources and we will continue to do that in hopes of locating her or her vehicle.' Hayden-Gordon had driven a distinctive blue 2003 Hyundai Elantra that was decorated with stickers of the sun, moon and stars on its hood. Missed: There has been no sign of Hayden-Gordon, known as 'Noodle' to her friends and students, since she left a concert and went to a restroom but witnesses said they saw her walking away with her car keys . Friends have made tearful pleas for information about the woman they called 'Noodles', a nickname that stuck after she became addicted to the food while in hospital recovering from a car accident as a child. 'My sister would never leave us. And she's the most loving, outgoing, friendly person,' Susan O'Leary told the Sun Sentinel. 'For her not to be here, be a part of our lives, I don't even know how to tell you what kinds of emotions you could have. We don't know what to do, where else to go, where else to turn.' Authorities urge anyone with information to call police at 954-764-4357 or Broward Crime Stoppers at 954-493-8477.","Police said that a body was found inside the vehicle in the New River in Fort Lauderdale on Friday .

"Robbie Savage has avoided a driving ban after his lawyer claimed the pundit is unable to share public transport with football fans who hate him . Robbie Savage has avoided a driving ban for clocking up 99mph on the motorway after his lawyer claimed the pundit is unable to share public transport with football fans who hate him. The 40-year-old, who was caught speeding as he drove home from Alan Shearer's charity ball, will be allowed to continue driving his £230,000 Bentley because it is considered 'a safe haven' for the controversial commentator. The former midfielder could have been banned for up to 28 days but was instead given a meagre £600 fine, despite a possible £2,500 penalty. Gary Rae, from the charity Brake, told MailOnline: 'It's an insult to those who have lost loved ones because of speeding drivers. 'Driving at such a dangerous speed hardly makes his luxury car a ""safe haven"" for other road users.' The court heard how Savage was caught on the A1 near Knaresborough last month, while driving back in a custom-made Bentley to his home in Prestbury, Cheshire, with his wife Sarah, according to The Sun. The pair had been at Shearer's ball the night beforehand and Savage was driving quickly to get home to his two sons, the court heard. The former Wales captain, who was not in court, was said to be running 'slightly late' after slowing for average speed cameras. Savage (left) had been driving back from a charity ball hosted by Alan Shearer (right) when he was stopped . The star was driving a £230,000 custom-built Bentley, similar to the one he is pictured with here . Savage's lawyer Philip Morris said the former Wales captain needed to keep his car because he is in 'regularly accosted in public' due to the nature of his work as a BBC and BT Sport pundit, in which he has to give controversial opinions. The barrister added: 'Someone once described him as being like Marmite. You either love him or the opposite.' He also told the court that Savage relied on family members to look after his children when he was busy because he is too famous to employ a babysitter, according to the Yorkshire Post. The star was given six points for the offence, bringing his total up to nine points, following a previous offence of using his phone at the wheel. Savage must also pay £85 costs and a £60 surcharge. In 2011 the footballer appeared on Strictly Come Dancing, partnering Ola Jordan in the BBC show . If he had been driving just 1mph faster, Savage would have been forced to attend court in person and would have been extremely likely to face an automatic ban. A spokesman for Savage refused to comment on the case. The player had a reputation as a hard-tackling midfielder during his career with clubs including Leicester City, Birmingham City, Blackburn Rovers and Derby County, and attracted fierce opposition from rival fans. He was originally a trainee with Manchester United, but despite being released by the Premier League giant Mr Savage went on to captain Wales, playing 39 times for his country. In 2011, he appeared on Strictly Come Dancing, partnering Ola Jordan, and he now hosts his own football show on BT Sport.","40-year-old caught speeding on way back from Alan Shearer's charity ball .

"The Internal Revenue's Office of Inspector General told Congress on Thursday that it is investigating whether former IRS official Lois Lerner committed crimes when her office targeted conservative nonproit groups for special scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status over a three-year period. Last year IRS Commissioner John Koskinen testified that untold thousands of Lerner's emails were lost when her hard drive crashed, and that there were no archives of the messages. But in a dramatic evening hearing, the House Oversight and Governmnt Reform Committee heard that investigators needed only two weeks to locate 32,774 of them on 744 backup tapes. IRS higher-ups, they said, had never asked them to look. Another 424 tapes have yet to be scoured. Deputy Inspector General Timothy Camus declared that his office is looking at 'potential criminal activity.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . STRANGER: A top IRS inspector said Thursday night that supposedly unrecoverable emails which might show the arc of a targeting scandal have been found on backup tapes . FOUND! – Lois Lerner's emails are turning up on backup tapes after the IRS commissioner testified that no such archives existed . 'SHOCKING': House Oversight Committee chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz was dumbfounded that IRS managers had never actually asked investigators to look for Lerner's emails . Inspector General Russell George bore the brunt of committee Democrats' anger for hsi refusal to produce additional records related to the scandal. 'You're not entitled to certain documents,' Mr. George told lawmakers. 'Oh really?' shot back Virginia Democratic Rep. Gerald Connolly. 'We'll see about that, won't we?' In a 2014 interview that aired during the Super Bowl, President Barack Obama told Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly that there was 'not even a smidgen of corruption' in the Lois Lerner case. Republicans slammed him at the time for commenting while an investigation was still ongoing. Neither Camus nor George would describe the contents of any of the emails at Thursday's hearing. Several Oversight Committee members questioned how hard the IRS tried to produce the emails, given how quickly independent investigators found them. ORLY? Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, pressed the IRS on whether more documents would be forthcoming . 'We have been patient. We have asked, we have issued subpoenas, we have held hearings,' said Itah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the committee. 'It's just shocking me that you start, (and) two weeks later you're able to find the emails.' The IRS issued a statement saying the agency 'has been and remains committed to cooperating fully with the congressional oversight investigations. The IRS continues to work diligently with Congress as well as support the review by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration.' The agency estimated it has spent $20 million responding to congressional inquiries, generating more than 1 million pages of documents and providing agency officials to testify at 27 congressional hearings. True the Vote, one of the tea party-linked groups that waited years for its tax-exempt application to be approved, claimed Friday that 'the IRS was apparently given instruction to do whatever necessary to silence those who spoke out against the Obama Administration. It became a West Wing weapon of choice.' 'Americans are beginning to understand that the politics of ""hope and change"" has an enforcement arm that operates like an organized crime syndicate.' Lerner retired near the end of 2013, with a full government pension, months after refusing to testify in an Oversight Committee hearing about how her Exempt Organizations Office chose to delay applications for years based on the presence of words like 'tea party' and 'patriots' in some groups' names. Some Democrats tried to diminish the significance of location thousands of Lerner's emails, pointing out that the IRS doesn't yet know if some or all – of them are already included in more than 70,000 other messages the IRS has already turned over to Congress. 'So as I understand it from your testimony here today, you are unable to confirm whether there are any, to use your own words, new emails, right?' New York Democratic Rep. Caolyn Maloney asked Camus. 'That is correct,' he replied. 'So what's before us may be material you already have, right?' she shot back . 'That is correct,' he said. Maloney threw up her hands and wondered aloud: 'So may I ask, why are we here?' The IRS inspector general set off a firestorm in May 2013 with an audit that uncovered what became known as the 'tea party targeting' scandal that unfolded during the 2010 and 2012 elections. Several hundred groups had their applications delayed for a year or more. Some were asked inappropriate questions about donors and group activities, the audit report said. Last year the entire House of Representatives voted, mostly along party lines, to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions.","IRS Deputy inspector general told a House of Representatives panel that his office found Lerner's emails on backup tapes .

"Max Maisel (above) has been missing since 8pm on Sunday night. He was last seen leaving his vehicle near Lake Ontario, New York . The parents of a missing student whose car was found abandoned on the shore of a lake have said they are 'heartbroken'. Max Maisel has been missing since 8pm on Sunday night and was last seen leaving his vehicle near Lake Ontario, New York. The 21-year-old is the son of senior ESPN writer Ivan Maisel, 55, and Meg Murray. The family, from Fairfield, Connecticut, have owned a five-bedroom vacation house near the area he went missing since 1999. They described Max, a third-year photography student at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), as 'very comfortable' there. A statement released by his parents said: 'We are heartbroken. At this point we still have more questions than answers. 'We are asking for the public, including the RIT college community, to help us as we continue our search for Max and try to reconstruct where he has been and when. 'Max was a photographer and was last seen in the vicinity of Charlotte Beach, an area that he had visited for many years. He felt very comfortable there.' Max is six feet, five inches tall and weighs about 135 pounds. His housemate Richard Otte saw Max leave their apartment late Sunday night and said he regrets not asking him where he was going as he thought it was odd. Mr Maisel tried to contact his son on Sunday but could not get hold of him. He said, however, that this was not uncommon and he was not concerned, New York Daily News reports.

"An Elvis super-fan was left all shook up after her dream trip to Graceland ended in a horror fall and a disastrous cock-up by her personal injury lawyers. Shaunna Baynes, 42, claims she suffered a broken nose and hip damage after stumbling over a sleeping British Airways worker in the business class section of her flight back home. The mother-of-one had been returning from a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, USA, as part of a 40th birthday trip paid for by kind-hearted hubby of 10 years Mark Baynes, 54, a train technician.

Mrs Baynes, who lives in Dagenham, Essex, fell just hours from landing at London Heathrow as she walked down the gangway to the toilets. She said: 'A few hours before we landed I got up to go to the toilet. I was walking down the aisle when I fell face first over the steward. 'I think in business class they have sleeping compartments but he was lying right across the aisle. 'I just wasn't expecting him to be there - who would be? 'An old lady, bless her, helped me up. She was the only person that did and I saw him there laying on the floor asleep. He didn't even wake up. 'Apparently he was asleep because he was disorientated but at the end of the day if that's the case then why was he up in the air? 'It had been a fantastic holiday until I hit the floor. I doubt I'll ever fly again.' 'I just worry what would have happened if it had been her or a pregnant woman. 'I feel lucky really as I could have done myself a lot more harm. It put a real dampener on what had been an amazing experience out in Graceland. 'I'm just relieved it didn't happen on the way there.' Mrs Baynes claims she suffered a broken nose, ligament damage in her right arm and soft tissue damage on her hip following the fall, which left her in a mobility scooter for six weeks. Mrs Baynes 'cried' when she got to Graceland because she 'couldn't believe it was actually happening' The mother-of-one is relieved her injury (right) didn't happen on her way to Elvis' fabled home (left) She had been on the final leg of her return from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago to Heathrow on November 3, 2012, when the accident happened. Two days after she got home from the trip, she contacted Peter Cornish at specialist personal injury solicitors Amwells in Islington, north London, in order to claim compensation from BA. But the specialists failed to lodge a lawsuit in time, meaning Shaunna was awarded a £2,000 payout from them instead of receiving compensation from the airline. Mr Cornish believed he had three years to take action, as in normal personal injury claims, but was unaware that there is a two-year limitation with cases in the air. The solicitor, who has dealt with personal injury claims for 13 years, admitted his mistake and his company paid her instead. He said: 'She's a nice lady and I made an error as a lawyer, which I wouldn't usually do. 'It was because of the two-year limitation period, so I said we're happy to pay up for this.'

'A supervisor apologised to me at the time but I said to her ""It's not your place to say sorry, the guy who was sleeping there should be apologising"". 'I've not had any correspondence from BA since the accident - not an apology, not anything. 'I know it was a freak accident but it could have easily been avoided. I just don't want anyone to have to go through the same thing.' Mrs Baynes is a huge fan of the entertainer known as The King. She said: 'I've been brought up with Elvis all my life.

"The widow of Chad Littlefield, the friend of American Sniper Chris Kyle who was gunned down at his side, has found happiness two years after the horrific events at Rough Creek shooting range. As Eddie Ray Routh, 26, begins his life sentence for the murders of Littlefield, 35, and Kyle, 38, who he shot in February 2012, Daily Mail Online can reveal that Leanne Littlefield has remarried and that she and new husband, Texas Ranger Jason Bobo, welcomed their first child, a son, Alex, just last month. Speaking to Daily Mail Online Leanne's father, retired firefighter Thomas Montgomery told of the family's gratitude at his daughter's second chance at happiness after such devastation, describing her new life as 'a blessing.' He said: 'She feels very happy with her new life. She's remarried and re-located. We feel like it's just a real blessing.' He explained that the family's main focus has been on protecting and shielding Leanne and Chad's daughter, Morgan, now 8, from the details of the case as played out in Stephenville Courthouse across the past two weeks. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New happiness: Leanne Littlefield and her new husband Jason Bobo, who she married after the devastating loss of her first husband Chad. Blessing: Leanna Bobo and her husband Jason posted this picture on social media from their wedding. Her father says her family feels that the marriage is  'a real blessing' Remembered: Chad Littlefield, his wife Leanne and their daughter Morgan in the picture they used on the program for his funeral . Neither Leanne nor her parents, Thomas and Kit, were present at the trial. Mr Montgomery said he 'didn't see that it would serve any purpose' for them to be there. He said: 'There are two kiddos to think about now. We know we can't shield her forever. The truth will become apparent in time but for now she knows her daddy is gone and he's in heaven and we just want to protect her as much as possible.' Leanne, now 36, was just 22 when she married Chad, then 23. Five years later their daughter, Morgan, was born. The day before he died Littlefield told his parents that his life was 'scary good.' He had a good job; Leanne – then a principal at Walnut Grove Middle School in Midlothian – had a good job. They were financially secure. Life, he said, was 'awesome.' Then, a few minutes at Rough Creek shooting range, where Kyle and Littlefield had taken former Marine Routh to help the PTSD sufferer assimilate to civilian life, destroyed everything. It is testament to her strength of spirit that Leanne has managed to rebuild and find a new life and a new love in Ranger Bobo whom she married last summer. He joined Ellis and Navarro County Rangers in 2010 and IS responsible for liaison with other law-enforcement agencies in the counties. Last March Ranger Bobo was honored by the US Attorney's office in Dallas. He was awarded for his investigative assistance in a multi-agency investigation that began as a kidnapping/barricaded subject. A resultant search warrant revealed a street sweeper destructive device, 12 firearms, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, rifle magazines, marijuana, surveillance cameras and $150,000 in cash. Jason Bobo is a Texas Ranger . According to Mr Montgomery the end of Routh's trial and his conviction is another vital step in the healing process and in moving forward with their new lives as a couple and a family. He said: 'We feel that the jury was just. I'm no psychiatrist. I mean the guy admitted to doing it and it just came down to what to do with him. 'You know at one time he seemed to be teetering [between sanity and insanity]. Is that cured? Probably not. But we do what the law says and we put him in jail and we keep him there. I don't know if that's good or bad or indifferent.' Unlike Taya Kyle, whose life has been focused on promoting her late husband's memory through public speaking, book tours and supporting Clint Eastwood's biopic 'American Sniper' by attending the Oscars, Leanne has chosen a different path. According to her father: 'Leanne's the direct opposite of Taya in personality and I'm not kicking Taya. Taya's a tough old girl. I'm sure she went through some pretty gut wrenching feelings every time Chris Kyle was deployed and she's very very tough. Friends: Chad Littlefield (right) and Chris Kyle (left) had met as soccer dads. Littlefield and Kyle both wanted to help veterans, leading to their fatal meeting with Eddie Ray Routh . Proud: Leanne and Jason Bobo welcomed their first son, Alex, with this message on social media . Victim: Famed U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, pictured with his wife Taya, was also shot dead by Routh. The two men had taken Routh to a shooting range to help him with his PTSD when they were killed . Guilty: Eddie Ray Routh, 27, was convicted of capital murder by a jury in Texas after just two hours of deliberations on Tuesday evening and has been sentenced to life in prison without parole . 'But I hope for her that now this is over she can back off and get her life to calm down some.' Mr Montgomery expressed a hope that all the families involved might now find a way towards some sort of peace. He said: 'I hope everybody can move forward – the Littlefields, the Kyles and even Routh's family because he's got parents and relatives too. I can't imagine how they feel. 'They've got to live with it for the rest of their lives just like the rest of us have to live with our loss all because of the actions of one guy. We're just so grateful for the blessings that Leanne has found.' The Kyle and Littlefield families have both given their blessing to the passing of a bill that will see a stretch of highway named after Chris Kyle, 38, and Chad Littlefield, 35. Daily Mail Online can reveal that the families have been assured by senate representatives that the Texas 84th Legislature currently sitting will push through the necessary bill. The move comes as an online petition to have the stretch of HWY 287, which runs through the men's hometown of Midlothian, named in their honor has gained close to its target 7,500 signatures. Taya Kyle gave her blessing to the motion last month with the Littlefield family joining her in support shortly before the trial began. A previous attempt to have the Highway renamed in March 2013 was unsuccessful. But the publicity surrounding Eddie Ray Routh's trial and the release of Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning biopic, 'American Sniper,' has seen a surge of support for the motion. Speaking to Daily Mail Online Jerry Richardson revealed: 'There had been talk of naming a school after them but a highway seems more fitting to me. Schools can come and go but that road will always be there in their honor.'","Chad Littlefield left widow Leanne behind when he and Chris Kyle were murdered by Eddie Ray Routh .

"A Pittsburgh woman convicted of stealing her cancer-stricken neighbor's dog and having the pet put down was sentenced to up to six months in jail on Friday. An Allegheny County judge ruled that 58-year-old Gisele Paris will serve jail time followed by 18 months of probation for stealing an eight-year-old Siberian Husky from her sick neighbor and having the dog euthanized, CBS reported. In December 2014, a jury found Paris guilty of theft, receiving stolen property and cruelty to animals. Paris claimed that she believed the dog, named Thor, was being neglected - despite a humane officer's assurances that Thor was not. Gisele: A judge sentenced Gisele Paris, 58 (photographed), Friday to three to six months and 18 months of probation . Thor's owner, Mark Boehler, who had been undergoing treatment for stage 3 esophageal cancer, pleaded for the safe return of the dog only to learn that Thor had been put down. Thor disappeared from Boehler's fenced-in yard on Thanksgiving Day in 2013, but Paris held that she found the dog in a vacant lot. 'I think it was very fair and there is justice,' Mr Boehler told TribLive about the sentence. 'She's going to pay dearly ... I was hoping that the judge would be hard on her and he was.' Paris claimed that she cared for the dog and took it to an animal hospital because it had been neglected but in February, decided to have it put down because the necessary treatments for the dog were too expensive. 'He was everything I had,' Boehler told CBS. 'I don't have no children, so they're like members of the family. Everybody that has a pet, they know that.' Thor: A jury found Paris guilty of stealing her neighbor's eight-year-old Siberian Husky, named Thor (photographed), and having it euthanized . In court in December, an attorney said Paris' action was an attempt to hide the fact that she had stolen the dog as police went to her home in search of the Husky, according to the Post-Gazette. 'Gisele Paris was on a criminally delusional mission to take Thor from a situation, from conditions that she didn't approve of,' the attorney said during the weeklong trial. 'Then it becomes more than she can deal with. The police close in on her, and she kills the dog to destroy the evidence.' A memorial was held for the husky in March 2014, during December's court proceedings, Boehler was disappointed when the judge denied his request to have the dog's remains returned to him, the Post-Gazette reports. Paris said she buried the dog on her family's farm in Armstrong County. The judge denied Boehler's request and went on to say that it is unlikely that the dog's remains are on the farm, noting that the ground in Armstrong County is as 'hard as [a] desk,' which would have made it difficult for Paris to bury the remains there. Paris appeared shaken up in court on Friday, TribLive reports, and said she was remorseful. Her attorney acknowledged that Paris was wrong for having the dog euthanized. Owner: The dog's owner Mark Boehler (photographed), who had been undergoing treatment for stage 3 esophageal cancer, pleaded for the safe return of the dog only to learn that Thor had been put down .","A judge sentenced Gisele Paris, 58, on Friday to three to six months and 18 months of probation her neighbor's dog and having it euthanized .

"Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich, who had recently launched a Republican campaign for governor, fatally shot himself on Thursday in what police described as an 'apparent suicide'. The 54-year-old's death came minutes after making phone calls to invite reporters to his suburban St. Louis home in Clayton, Missouri, for an interview. At least one family member - his wife Kathy - was at home during the incident and called emergency services. Spokesman Spence Jackson said his boss had recently appeared upset about the comments people were supposedly making about his religious faith and about a radio ad describing him as 'a weak candidate for governor' who 'could be easily confused for the deputy sheriff of Mayberry' and could 'be manipulated'. Scroll down for video . Missouri state auditor Tom Schweich, 54, (pictured on January 28) fatally shot himself on Thursday minutes after inviting reporters to his home for an interview discussing allegations that the head of the Missouri Republican Party had made anti-Semitic comments about him . Schweich, second from left, makes a few comments after his swearing-in ceremony on January 12 this year in his Capitol office in Jefferson City. At left is his wife, Kathy, and to his right are son, Thomas Jr., and daughter Emilie. The state auditor died Thursday morning in what police describe as an 'apparent suicide' 'The campaign had been difficult, as all campaigns are,' Jackson said. 'There were a lot of things that were on his mind'. Just 13 minutes before police got the call from his home, Schweich had a phone conversation with The Associated Press about his plans to go public that afternoon with allegations that the head of the Missouri Republican Party had made anti-Semitic comments about him. The state GOP chairman John Hancock denied doing so in an interview later on Thursday. Schweich, a father of two, had Jewish ancestry but attended an Episcopal church. His death stunned many of Missouri's top elected officials, who described him as a 'brilliant' and 'devoted' public servant with an 'unblemished record' in office. Jackson said Schweich had been diligently going about his work, with another audit scheduled to be released next week. Schweich postponed a planned press conference to allege the state GOP chairman of anti-Semitic remarks about him on Tuesday. But he called the AP at 9.16am on Thursday inviting a reporter to his home for a 2.30pm interview and noting that a reporter from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch also had been invited. An AP reporter spoke with Schweich by phone again at 9.35am to confirm the upcoming interview. St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Tony Messenger wrote in an obituary that Schweich had called him and left a message at 9.41am, but he has decided not to release what the voicemail said. Police said the emergency call to Schweich's house was received at 9.48am. It is unclear whether his children, Thomas Jr. and Emilie, were home at the time. Emergency services were called to Schweich's home (pictured) at 9.48am on Thursday morning, seven minutes after he left a voicemail with St. Louis Today reporter Tony Messenger . In conversations with the AP, Schweich said he had heard that Hancock had been making phone calls last fall in which he mentioned in an off-handed way that Schweich was Jewish. Schweich said he felt the comments were anti-Semitic and wanted Hancock to resign the party chairmanship to which he had been elected last Saturday. Hancock, who is a political consultant, told the AP on Thursday that Schweich had talked to him about the alleged comments last November, but not since then. He said he held meetings last fall with prospective donors for a project to register Catholic voters. He added that if he had mentioned that Schweich was Jewish, it would have been in the context that Hanaway was Catholic but that was no indication of how Catholics were likely to vote. 'I don't have a specific recollection of having said that, but it's plausible that I would have told somebody that Tom was Jewish because I thought he was, but I wouldn't have said it in a derogatory or demeaning fashion,' Hancock said. Clayton Police Chief Kevin Murphy said Schweich was pronounced dead at a hospital from a single gunshot after paramedics responded to the emergency call. 'Everything at this point does suggest that it is an apparent suicide,' Murphy said, adding that an autopsy would be conducted on Friday. Schweich's mentor, former U.S. Sen. John Danforth, said in a statement to St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Schweich was a 'dear friend and long-time colleague' and mentioned his pain for the auditor's wife and two children. 'He was brilliant and energetic and he lived the highest standards of personal conduct and professional ethics,' he said. 'I am heartbroken for Kathy, Emilie and Thomas. What an awful loss.' Schweich had been in office since January 2011 and had easily won election in November to a second, four-year term. He announced a month ago that he was seeking the Republican nomination for governor in 2016, and was gearing up for an expected primary fight against Catherine Hanaway, a former U.S. attorney and Missouri House speaker. At the Capitol early Thursday afternoon, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon and Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder joined lawmakers in the House chamber for a brief prayer service remembering Schweich. Hanaway said in a statement that she was 'deeply saddened' by Schweich's death and described him as 'an extraordinary man with an extraordinary record of service to our state and nation.' Schweich, who attended Yale University and then Harvard Law School, made his political debut in 2009. He had initially considered running for the seat being vacated in 2010 by Republican U.S. Sen. Kit Bond, and he had the encouragement from Danforth. But Schweich defered to Rep. Roy Blunt to avoid a divisive GOP Senate primary and instead challenged and defeated Democratic State Auditor Susan Montee in the 2010 election. Schweich spent last weekend wooing fellow Republicans during the state GOP's annual conference in Kansas City. He spoke energetically, frequently touting his work rooting out government waste and corruption as auditor. But he also emphasized charity, citing his Christian beliefs as a source of compassion and promising to cut back on government spending and misuse without hurting the poor. 'Part of being a Christian is you gotta help people,' Schweich said while speaking to about a dozen members of the Missouri Republican Assembly on Saturday, his wife watching from the back of a small conference room in the Kansas City Marriott Downtown. Schweich was Danforth's chief of staff for the 1999 federal investigation into the deadly government siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, and followed Danforth to the United Nations, where he was chief of staff for the U.S. delegation. President George W. Bush appointed Schweich to the State Department in 2005 as an international law enforcement official. Two years later, Bush picked Schweich to coordinate the anti-drug and justice reform efforts in Afghanistan. Flags around the Missouri Capitol complex in Jefferson City were lowered to half staff  on Thursday after Schweich's death was announced .","Tom Schweich, 54, died in an apparent suicide at his home on Thursday .

"As a guitarist and singer for folk band Canach, Caitlin McNeill has long dreamed of achieving worldwide fame. But it was a picture of a dress rather than her musical talent has made her a global star - and all because no one could agree on its real colour. Commented on by everyone from celebrities to politician, the unexpected popularity of the photo has left Caitlin reeling. Scroll down for video . Caitlin McNeill poses with a picture of the dress on her mobile that has made her famous around the world . Caitlin, a guitarist and singer for folk band Canach, started the worldwide debate over the colour of a dress . The 21-year-old, from the island of Colonsay in the Hebrides, has spoken of her shock over the worldwide furore her post caused. 'I thought my followers on Tumblr would maybe have a good reaction, but I never would have considered that Taylor Swift and Mindy Kaling would be tweeting about it,' she told Business Insider. She added in a comment on her band's Facebook page which read: 'It seems like we've caused quite the stir online! This is madness!' Thanks to the intense media interest in the two-tone dress, Caitlin has found herself inundated with requests to share her story and has appeared on radio shows in Canada and the U.S. as well as in her native UK. She said of the response to her post: 'It was insane, I still feel like I'm in dream, it's crazy seeing all the Tweets. I kept tabs on it for a couple of hours but then I completely lost track.' She added in the interview for Canadian radio station KISS 92.5: 'I think I'd like to say I'm sorry to half the world, and I'd like to say I'm glad you have had a good time arguing with your families to the rest of the world!' Caitlin - who hails from the remote island of Colonsay in the Hebrides - said she can't believe how much of a reaction her Tumblr post has caused around the globe . Caitlin first posted the image of the £50 figure-hugging frock by Roman Originals on her Tumblr account after her friend's mother wore the dress to a wedding. She wrote the caption: 'Guys please help me - is this dress white and gold, or blue and black? Me and my friends can't agree and we are freaking the f*** out.' The dress was worn by Cecelia Bleasdale when her daughter Grace Johnston tied the knot. Prior to the big day, Ceceila sent a picture of the frock to her daughter and she and her fiance, Keir Johnston, disagreed over the colour. They shared it with their friends of Facebook to see what they thought. But it was when Caitlin, who agreed to play at the wedding with her bandmates, posted the picture on Tumblr that the issue went global and started trending on Twitter. Caitlin's picture of the dress, left, that many see as gold and white, but it's actually blue and black, right, made by Birmingham firm Roman Originals . The aspiring musician told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat how the events unfolded: 'Two of my very good friends were getting married and they asked me to put together a band to come and play at the wedding. 'This was a wedding on the tiny island that we come from on the west coast of Scotland called Colonsay and about 100 people were there. 'A week beforehand the bride had been sent by her mother a picture of the dress she was going to wear and when the bride showed her fiance, they disagreed about what colour it was. 'She was like, ""It's white and gold"" and he said, ""It's blue and black"".' While thousands of people have declared online what colour they think it is, it has since been confirmed that the dress was indeed black and blue - and the gold and white shades seen by some are an optical illusion. Caitlin said she's yet to hear an explanation of why the dress is viewed in different shades and she's bemused that so many of the world's experts have puzzled over the image. The dress that launched a thousand Tweets: Cecelia Bleasdale, left, wearing the dress on Saturday to the wedding of her daughter Grace Johnston and husband Keir Johnston . Kim Kardashian West joined the debate saying she thought it was white and gold on Twitter . Ellen DeGeneres also commented on the debate causing Caitlin to say the reaction was 'madness' Achieving worldwide fame is something Caitlin hoped she would always do for her music after she taught herself the guitar and attended the National Centre of Excellence in Traditional Music at Plockton High School, in Ross-Shire, Scotland. She's already well-known on the island Colonsay, although that is because it has just 125 inhabitants and as a result, everyone knows everyone else. It is the most remote fully-fledged community in Great Britain and has two churches, two doctors, two restaurants, one shop, one hotel, a village hall and one school. The island is 10 miles long and two miles wide and is accessed by ferry from Oban, Argyll. She joined forces with Alana MacInnes and Robbie Greig to form the band Canach, who play traditional Scottish folk music, and had been asked to perform at the now infamous wedding. On the band's Facebook page, their biography states that 'a stream of local concerts and gigs is steadily building the reputation and fan base of this dynamic trio'. But they would never had thought it would have been a dress rather than one of their songs that truly put them on the map.","Caitlin McNeill comes from remote island of Colonsay in the Hebrides .

"British Airways has apologised to a Shropshire family who spent 25 hours at a New York airport before their journey back to the UK. The Smiths said they slept on the floor and used their coats as bedding at John F Kennedy International Airport, where thousands of travellers were stranded over the weekend by a winter storm. Their return flight, which was cancelled, was a codeshare operated by American Airlines, although the family’s package holiday was booked through BA. The Smith family slept on the floor and used their coats as bedding at John F Kennedy International Airport . Andrew Smith, 38, said the transatlantic trip was the first time they had flown with BA – and possibly the last as they weren't happy with the partner airlines. Andrew, from Bishop’s Castle, claims there was a lack of information from staff inside the terminal, and BA and American Airlines could have done more to help passengers book new flights. He claims American Airlines staff 'disappeared' after the flight was cancelled and they told passengers to collect their luggage and rebook their flights. He told MailOnline Travel: ‘I understand all the delays for the weather, that’s not the issue. They just shrugged their shoulders and said we can’t do anything about it.’ Andrew Smith (second from right) travelled to New York with his wife, Tracy, and their three children . Andrew Smith sent a series of tweets to British Airways to complain about his family's experience . Andrew said he called BA and rebooked their flights, and then went to a BA desk inside the airport. He said: 'A manager basically laughed at us and said, ""It’s not our problem, it’s American Airlines’ problem"". 'I’d like an apology from American Airlines and BA for the way the staff treated me and everyone else at that airport. It's totally unacceptable.' The family complained to BA and received an apology, a £250 voucher for a future trip and reimbursement for their costs at the airport. Still, Andrew said he isn't satisfied with the apology. He said: ‘It’s not an apology for the way the staff treated us. They’ve apologised for the inconvenience and it’s a gesture of good will.’ A BA spokesman said the airline's customer relations team offered an apology that covered 'the whole experience', and will contact the family again to repeat it. Andrew said a BA employee who he spoke to on the phone offered a free hotel stay, but he declined the offer because they had to wait until about 8am to collect their luggage and they 'would only be [in the room] for a couple of hours' before they had to return for their rescheduled flight. He said: 'The offer was there in theory but on the practical side of that it was no good.' Travellers sleep on the floor inside Terminal 4 at John F Kennedy International Airport last Sunday . Andrew travelled to the Big Apple with his wife, Tracy, and their children – Chelsea, 17, Robbie, 12, and eight-year-old Hudson – to celebrate Tracy’s 37th birthday. They had a fantastic time taking in the sights, sounds and culinary delights in America’s most populous city, but claim the trip went awry after they boarded their flight to London Heathrow Airport. They were scheduled to depart on Saturday night and land in London on Sunday morning, but a winter storm caused delays for thousands of other travellers. The plane carrying the Smiths sat on the runway for four hours and had to return to the gate because of bad weather. The family holiday to New York was intended as a way to celebrate Tracy Smith's 37th birthday . British Airways responded to Andrew Smith after he complained that he had been 'let down' The airline informed the Smiths that flights across the US East Coast were affected by a winter storm . The delay was made worse for passengers when the captain announced that the flight was cancelled because its crew was nearing its maximum allowable hours and required rest. Passengers had to wait another six hours to retrieve their luggage, said Andrew. He said his family slept on their suitcases in the departure lounge – catching very little shut-eye – and spent several more hours inside the terminal before their flight departed Sunday night. ‘Two of my children had to miss a day of school due to the delays and there is a possibility that we will be fined for doing so.’ The Smiths were supposed to return to the UK on Sunday morning, but didn't arrive until Monday afternoon . Icy weather closed John F Kennedy International Airport last weekend, leaving thousands stranded . Andrew Smith complained to British Airways and American Airlines, which operated the codeshare flight . A British Airways spokeswoman told MailOnline Travel: ‘We are sorry that the family were delayed on their journey back to the UK. ‘During the delay, we did offer them hotel accommodation for the night, and we will be reimbursing the costs they incurred at the airport.' While the family was stranded at the airport, Andrew sent a series of tweets to BA, including a photo purportedly showing his wife and children sleeping on the floor. A BA employee responded with two tweets, writing: ‘I understand you're frustrated, it's never acceptable for our passengers to be in this position. Regrettably, all transportation across the East Coast has been affected by a severe winter storm.’ Andrew said he checked the weather reports and was surprised flights were being cancelled. But the weather was so poor that JFK Airport closed two runways on Sunday morning as its crews cleared snow and ice. Passengers aboard an Air France flight from New York to Paris also experienced lengthy delays as a result of the weather and staffing. Their flight departed New York six hours behind schedule early Sunday morning and was forced to divert to Manchester Airport because its flight crew was approaching its limit for flight time as a result of the initial delay. The Airbus A380 was forced to remain at Manchester Airport because of a cabin pressure problem. As a result, Air France sent three additional Airbus aircraft – two A320s and an A318 – to pick up the passengers and fly them to Paris. Some passengers were nearly 20 hours behind schedule when they arrived at Paris’ Charles de Gaulle Airport.","Bad weather left Andrew Smith and his family stranded at JFK Airport .

"Almost 600 patients are dying in hospitals each year because of hunger and thirst, figures show. Bereaved relatives have told how their loved ones were ‘forgotten to death’ by staff who refused to help them eat or drink. Figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that 7,949 deaths have been attributed to hunger and thirst in the past decade. 'Forgotten to death': Almost 600 patients are dying in hospitals each year because of hunger and thirst, figures show, with bereaved relatives saying staff refused to help them eat or drink. (Stock image) In recent years, however, numbers have fallen – suggesting the standards of nursing care are showing signs of improvement. The figures show that in NHS and private hospitals in 2013, dehydration was recorded as an underlying cause of death or a contributory factor in 574 deaths. In 2008 the total was 942. In 2013 a further 336 deaths were logged with malnutrition being an underlying cause or contributory factor. The two figures cannot be added together to give a total because some patients would have been recorded in both categories. Another 88 deaths in care homes in 2013 were attributed to dehydration and 33 to malnutrition, according to the figures which were obtained by Channel 4 News. The family of a retired engineer who died of acute dehydration have told how staff dumped drinks by his bed without bothering to help him reach them. Stanley Mack, 77, was admitted to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham with a chest infection and was later diagnosed with the superbug Clostridium difficile. He died three weeks later in July 2008 and, during his final days, his family say hospital staff failed to realise he was rapidly deteriorating. His widow Carol said last night: ‘There was no record that was reliable of what he was being given. ‘He would be given drinks and they would be left there and occasionally they would be written up as given to him, but we knew when we were there that he was not drinking it. ‘However, it was described, it wasn’t run in a way that met the patient’s needs. And of course, because of that his condition was allowed to deteriorate and particularly, for him to become acutely dehydrated.’ Busy: Figures show that in NHS and private hospitals in 2013, dehydration was recorded as an underlying cause of death or a contributory factor in 574 deaths. In 2008 the total was 942. (Stock picture) The family have endured a five-year legal battle with the hospital to try to get to the bottom of exactly how the pensioner died. An initial inquest returned a narrative verdict – suggesting no-one was at fault. But the family appealed for a second inquest in 2013 which ruled Mr Mack had died from dehydration. Speaking to Channel 4 News, his widow added: ‘The legal challenges that we faced along the way were very, very considerable but we felt we just had to persist. Really to do justice to Stan’s memory. And we just didn’t want other people to have the same experience.’ His son Ian said: ‘I think in this case my dad was forgotten completely. It was the hospital’s job to get the basics right and very clearly they failed. He was absolutely forgotten to death. ‘There was a whole range of things that should have happened monitoring hydration and nutrition and other things which simply didn’t happen. Something went very badly wrong at Selly Oak Hospital.’ The Mail has long highlighted appalling neglect in hospitals and care homes as part of its Dignity for the Elderly campaign.","Bereaved relatives say their loved ones were 'forgotten to death'

"Astronomers have discovered stars forming in a remote region of the Milky Way not thought possible before. The stars were seen in a cloud of molecular gas 16,000 light-years below the flattened disc of our galaxy - further than any others ever seen. And if any planets were to form around these stars, inhabitants would see the entire glory of the spiral galaxy above them in their night sky. Brazilian scientists have discovered remote stars forming in the Milky Way. They are the most distant stars ever to be seen forming in the galaxy. Shown is an image from Nasa’s Wise telescope of dust emissions, centred on the star cluster called Camargo 438. Some of the stars may be hidden by dust . The amazing discovery - led by Dr Denilso Camargo of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil - marks the first time that star-forming clusters that are part of the Milky Way have been found this far from our galaxy. ‘This is the first time astronomers have found stars being born in such a remote location,’ said Dr Camargo. ‘Our work shows that the space around the galaxy is a lot less empty than we thought.’ Previously, it was only thought possible for stars to form inside giant molecular clouds (GMC) located in the inner part of the galactic disc. The Milky Way is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars. This makes it a ‘middleweight’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known, IC 1101, containing more than 100 trillion stars. On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky, the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars. Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape. At the centre of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are created. And also at the centre is a supermassive black hole, known as Sagittarius A*. Astronomers believe the Milky Way wasn’t always a stunning barred spiral, though. It may have formed into its current size by ‘eating’ other galaxies. Within these clumps, many stars are born together in clusters. Using Nasa’s orbiting Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise) telescope, Dr Camargo and his team discovered several GMCs above and below the disc of our Milky Way. But they were shocked to find that one GMC 16,000 light-years from the galactic centre contained two clusters of stars forming. Their location is towards the outer limits of our galaxy - far enough that they would see the entire splendour of its spiral above them, but not so far that they are not classified as being in the Milky Way. From the position of Earth in the Milky Way, the galaxy appears flat, with most of its material surrounding the supermassive black hole at its centre. The new clusters are named Camargo 438 and 439, reported the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), and are located within the molecular cluster known as HRK 81.4-77.8. The cloud is thought to be about two million years old, and is located towards the constellation of Cetus. The discovery was made using Nasa’s orbiting Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise) telescope (artist's illustration shown). Dr Camargo and his team discovered several GMCs above and below the disc of our Milky Way - But they were shocked to find that one GMC contained two clusters of stars forming . The new clusters are named Camargo 438 (left) and 439 (right), reported the Royal Astronomical Society, and are located within the molecular cluster known as HRK 81.4-77.8. Both of these images are 24 light-years across, and the black dots in the image are individual stars . If any planets are in orbit of the stars, this illustration is the view they would see of the Milky Way. The location of the clusters is towards the outer limits of our galaxy - far enough that they would see the entire splendour of its spiral above them, but not so far that they are not classified as being in the Milky Way . There are currently two theories explaining how stars came to be forming in this region so far from the Milky Way, where dust and gas is thought to be much less abundant. One theory is known as the Chimney Model, which suggests that supernovae and other violent explosions ejected dust and gas out of the galactic disc, merging to form these GMCs. This would have required several hundred massive stars to explode over several generations, creating a ‘superwind’ that moved HRK 81.4-77.8 to its present location. Bubbles from these explosions would then lead to the creation of new stars within the cloud. The other theory suggests that the interaction between the Milky Way and its satellite, known as the Magellanic Clouds, may have disturbed gas falling into the galaxy, giving rise to these distant clouds. ‘The new clusters of stars are truly exotic,’ said Dr Camargo, according to the RAS. ‘In a few million years, any inhabitants of planets around the stars will have a grand view of the outside of the Milky Way, something no human being will probably ever experience. ‘Now we want to understand how the ingredients for making stars made it to such a distant spot. ‘We need more data and some serious work on computer models to try to answer this question.’ One theory to how the stars came to be is known as the Chimney Model, which suggests that supernovae (illustration shown) and other violent explosions ejected dust and gas out of the galactic disc, merging to form these GMCs. Bubbles from these explosions would then lead to the creation of new stars . The discovery is the most distant example of star formation taking place in our galaxy. Many other closer such regions have been discovered before, such as the Coronet cluster, seen here, which is located about 500 light-years away.

"The Navy had spent £1 million in fuel getting to the Red Sea when the operation was called off - and it cost another £1 million to reach the Gulf of Oman, where a new exercise was hastily arranged for the Marines . The Royal Marines have been forced to cancel their biggest amphibious landing for more than a decade after their French allies pulled out. The Navy had spent £1 million in fuel getting to the Red Sea when the operation was called off - and it cost another £1 million to reach the Gulf of Oman, where a new exercise was hastily arranged for the Marines. More than 1,500 commandos had been in training to storm the shoreline of Djibouti - with 500 French ‘Troupes de Marine’ ready to back them up. Navy sources said the decision to cancel was taken by the French after a breakdown in relations over ‘administrational issues’. The Royal Marines are said to have responded furiously as Exercise Djibouti Lion had taken a year to set up. The landing was due to take place later this month with 42 Commando Royal Marines, led by Lieutenant Colonel Neil Sutherland, poised to provide the spearhead of the amphibious force. Around 600 of Lieut-Col Sutherland’s Marines had sailed to the Red Sea aboard a fleet of 12 Royal Navy ships belonging to the UK’s newly-formed Response Force Task Group. The fleet was led by the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious, and also included the amphibious landing ship HMS Bulwark, the frigates HMS Montrose and Westminster, and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary support vessels Lyme Bay and Mounts Bay. Navy sources last night confirmed that the ships had burned up to £1 million in fuel while cruising into position - with another £1 million in fuel to take the ships on to the Gulf of Oman for the new exercise. The cancellation is a major blow for the head of the Royal Navy, First Sea Lord Sir George Zambellas. He is committed to establishing a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force - of British and French personnel and ships - by 2016. A Navy source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Djibouti Lion had been planned for at least a year in advance and was supposed to be the set-piece event of 2013 for the Marines – with the amphibious assault being bigger than anything we’ve done since 2000. Navy sources said the decision to cancel was taken by the French after a breakdown in relations over 'administrational issues' ‘Everyone is gutted. Djibouti had been chosen to stage the amphibious landing because there was nowhere in Britain big enough for so many Marines to come ashore. ‘There was no point us conducting the exercise on our own after the French pulled out. The whole point of Djibouti Lion was to test how we can operate together, with British and French marines fighting shoulder to shoulder. So when the French left it was game over. So much for entente cordiale!’ The Ministry of Defence confirmed the exercise had been scrapped. The French Defence  Ministry declined to comment.","Royal Marines forced to cancel biggest amphibious landing for a decade .

"Servando 'LaTuta' Gomez, 49, was caught on Friday in Morelia, Michoacan's state capital after months of intelligence work . One of Mexico's most wanted drug lords, 'La Tuta', has been captured. Servando Gomez, 49, was caught on Friday in Morelia, Michoacan's state capital after months of intelligence work by Mexican security forces. He was cornered in a house in a peaceful showdown  where no shots were fired - making him the second drug kingpin to fall in just over a year. Gomez, is implicated in the 2009 murder of 12 Mexican federal police officers, according to the United States Justice Department. He is also wanted by the U.S. government for methamphetamine and cocaine trafficking. A Mexican police spokesman said: 'He will be brought to Mexico City in the coming hours to make a declaration.' His arrest marks a victory for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto as he grapples with grisly gang violence and attempts to quell outrage over violence, impunity and corruption in Mexico. He is battling against lingering public anger over the September abduction and apparent massacre of 43 trainee teachers by corrupt police in league with gang members. Gomez, who had a $2 million bounty on his head before his arrest, was known as La Tuta' because he was a former teacher and left his profession to become a drug boss. Scroll down for video . Drug lord: Gomez, pictured, became the front man of the Knights Templar after a split within drug cartel La Familia Michoacana, a pseudo-religious gang in which he was also a leading figure . But he became the prime target of Pena Nieto's drive to regain control of Michoacan. Last year, in another coup, Cartel boss Joaquin 'Shorty' Guzman, head of the Sinaloa Cartel, a powerful drug smuggling gang was captured. He was cooking breakfast along with his beauty queen wife when police smashed down the door of the condo where they were hiding in Mazatlan, a beach resort town on Mexico's Pacific Coast. Both Guzman and Gomez were feared drug lords. However the man caught up in the country's latest sting, Gomez, often sought the limelight. Whether railing against political corruption on YouTube, or . giving interviews in hideouts to the media, Gomez relentlessly . baited the government. He continuously accused officials of colluding with rival gangs . while defending his Knights Templar as a 'necessary evil.' 'Our only function is to help the people, preserve our . state, and preserve our country from people causing terror,' Gomez said in a video posted online in 2012, sitting in front of . images of Ernesto 'Che' Guevara and other revolutionary icons. Powerful: Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman is escorted to a helicopter in handcuffs by Mexican navy marines at a navy hanger in Mexico City, Mexico, after finally being captured following years on the run . Gomez insisted the cartel followed a strict ethical code, . though as time passed he became more open about the criminal . side of a gang. In 2013 it held much of the impoverished, . mountainous terrain of Michoacan in a firm grip and often extorted a . broad sweep of businesses. They also controlled politicians and . diversified from drug trafficking into a myriad of other . businesses including the export of iron ore. Gomez became the front man of the Knights Templar after a . split within drug cartel La Familia Michoacana, a . pseudo-religious gang in which he was also a leading figure. Sporting a goatee beard and often wearing a baseball cap, . Gomez began smuggling marijuana independently in 2001 or 2002, . before later joining La Familia, authorities said. The area is a violent western state wracked by clashes between Gomez's Knights Templar cartel and heavily-armed vigilantes trying to oust them. Last week, police seized many properties there and . arrested a handful of people connected to La Tuta. Local media . reported that an earlier operation had led to the arrest of the . drug boss. Police also arrested a number of other people with him. Since the Mexican government began a military crackdown in . 2007 on drug gangs, more than 100,000 people have been killed in . drug-related violence.","Servando 'LaTuta' Gomez, 49, was caught on Friday in Morelia .

"A 'dark' storyline in soap Emmerdale has attracted dozens of complaints just weeks after a similar plot took place in EastEnders. Last night's Emmerdale featured a scene in which Natalie Anderson's character Alicia Metcalfe was sexually assaulted by teenager Lachlan White, played by Thomas Atkinson. The soap, which was aired at the earlier time of 6.45pm because of Europa football matches, came with warning of 'distressing scenes' before it was shown, but still angered some viewers. Scroll down for video . In last night's episode of Emmerdale Natalie Anderson's character Alicia Metcalfe (right) was sexually assaulted by Lachlan White, played by Thomas Atkinson (left), attracting 47 complaints . An Ofcom spokesman said: 'Ofcom has received 47 complaints regarding Emmerdale on ITV yesterday. We are assessing these before deciding whether to investigate or not.' A spokeswoman for the ITV soap said: 'Lachlan is a very troubled teenager and his assault upon Alicia is the beginning of a very dark storyline for his character. We thoroughly researched this aspect of the plot and the drama was intentionally implicit rather than explicit.' Viewers were told before the episode was broadcast that it included 'distressing' scenes 'that some viewers may find difficult to watch'. The episode, which had to be brought forward to the earlier time of 6.45pm, did feature warnings of 'distressing scenes' before it aired, but still drew anger from some viewers . Only last month, Ofcom cleared the BBC of breaching broadcasting rules with a controversial rape storyline in EastEnders which prompted a number of complaints. More than 90 people wrote to Ofcom to voice concerns about the incident, screened in October, in which Queen Vic landlady Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) was attacked by Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo). But Ofcom cleared the edition of the BBC1 soap as result of warnings given to viewers and its avoidance of graphic content.","Ofcom says it is deciding whether to investigate scene of sexual assault .

"Toxic water in Britain's lakes may contain bacteria linked to Alzheimer's, scientists fear. Huge increases in poisonous algae have been recorded in freshwater lakes since the 1880s. And scientists fear that colonies of the plant life could pose a threat to drinking water because they harbour toxins that can damage the liver and nervous system. The algae has even been linked to neuro-degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease. Poisonous algae (pictured) has been linked to neuro-degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease. Pictured is a buildup of the plant in the Serpentine River, London . The study, carried out by experts from the University of Nottingham and McGill University in Canada, examined more than 100 lakes across Europe and North America – including waterways in the Lake District, West Midlands meres, Scottish lochs and Northern Ireland's upland lakes. Their findings showed that in the past 200 years, 58 per cent of lakes had seen a significant boost in the concentrations of blue-green algae pigments. Scientists fear the increase has been driven by pollution from industrial sites and sewers that pump nitrogen and phosphorus into the lakes, which the algae thrives on. The first signs of exposure to the harmful algae are skin rash or irritation, gastroenteritis and respiratory distress. Exposure to low doses of the algae can result in liver tumours or hormone disruption. Zofia Taranu from McGill University said: 'We found that cyanobacterial populations have expanded really strongly in many lakes since the advent of industrial fertilisers and rapid urban growth. 'While we already knew that cyanobacteria prefer warm and nutrient-rich conditions, our study is also the first to show that the effect of nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, overwhelm those of global warming.' There have been some 150 reported sightings of the algae in Britain's waterways in a year, and in 2013 it covered the lake in St James' Park opposite Buckingham Palace. Algae blooms can cut off fish's oxygen supply and dozens of dogs are put down every year for ingesting it.","Toxic water in Britain's lakes may contain bacteria linked to Alzheimer's .

"A Texas mother was arrested after she was caught on video pulling a gun on a teenage girl who was fighting her daughter in a public park. Two female students from Pasadena High School in Houston confronted each other Tuesday afternoon, when one of the girls' mothers, Virianda Alvarez, showed up armed with a handgun. According to school officials, Ms Alvarez, 33, aimed the gun at her daughter's rival and threatened her. Scroll down for video .

An armed officer with the Pasadena Independent School District showed up a short time later and broke up the fight. Virianda Alvarez was arrested Tuesday night and charged with aggravated assault. She is being held on $35,000 bond. During her first court appearance, Alvarez told a judge that she just wanted to 'scare' her daughter's rival with the gun, and her family later told the station KPRC2 that the weapon was not loaded. The violent brawl broke out in the park across the street from Pasadena High School after class Tuesday, drawing a large crowd of spectators. Victoria Myers, 14, told the station KHOU she got into a dispute with Virianda Alvarez's daughter over a boy, and then the girl’s friends challenged her to show up for a fight.

"For some, going on holiday means a chance to escape from the norms of everyday life and embrace a new culture. But for others, there are some 'home comforts' that are just too hard to leave behind. A plea for a Scottish chef to cook haggis in Brussels, help to rescue an event's British-style floral displays and advice on tuning a TV in Italy to receive channels in English were among the bizarre requests made by travellers. One tourist staying in Brussels asked the British Consulate if they could help him arrange a Scottish chef to cook his party some haggis . The embassy in Mexico City was asked to assist in finding out whether a man had left his mobile phone on a plane while foreign office staff in France were asked to provide advice on treating a cat's infected paw. Foreign Office Minister David Lidington said while consular staff provided assistance to thousands of travellers, they were not able to 'act as veterinary surgeons'. Last year the FCO's contact centres received more than 365,000 calls from British nationals and while the vast majority were genuine requests from people who needed help, thousands related to issues that staff were unable to assist with. The request for a Belgium-based Scottish chef came from an event coordinator in Brussels who was arranging a Burns Night celebration. It's always nice to find some TV channels in your native language when on holiday, but calling the Foreign Office to help tune these in is perhaps a step too far . A person in France thought the best department to help treat their cat's infected paws was the Foreign Office . A call in the USA asking for assistance with a floral display came after the professional gardener hired to create hanging baskets for a trade fair got 'stage fright'. A caller asking for help with setting up ‘British-style’ hanging baskets at a trade show because the professional gardener hired for the purpose had stage fright .

A man called requesting that staff at the British Embassy in Mexico City go to the airport to check whether he had left his mobile phone on a plane. A woman in Italy calling to enquire how she could synchronise her TV antenna to receive English channels. An event coordinator in Brussels asking for the name of a Scottish chef based in the country who could make Haggis for a Burns Night event. Can you chase up British Airways to find out where my son’s missing suitcase is? I need to book the cheapest possible flights to New Zealand, can you send me some options? My scooter has been stolen in Panama, what can you do to find it? I want to become a Lord, how do I get a title? Can you recommend somewhere for me to get a roast dinner in the Philippines? One British woman asked the consulate in Albania how to find out if her son's fiancee was already married. Mr Lidington said: 'It is important for FCO consular staff to be able to focus on our most vulnerable customers, such as victims of crime, those who have lost a loved one abroad or people who have been detained or hospitalised overseas. 'Consular staff support thousands of British nationals who encounter difficulties overseas every year and we handle over 365,000 enquires annually. 'We will always try to help where we can but there are limits to what we can do, so it's important for people to be aware of how we can help. 'We can issue an emergency travel document if your passport is lost or stolen, offer support if you become a victim of crime or visit you in hospital or prison, but we aren't able to pay medical bills, give legal advice or get you out of jail, or indeed act as veterinary surgeons.' Meg Williams, the head of the FCO's global contact centres, said: 'The role of the FCO Contact Centres is to help enable consular staff to focus on what is important and to concentrate on those in need, but we continue to receive misdirected enquiries from British nationals. 'We receive hundreds of thousands of calls every year and while the vast majority of these are from British nationals in genuine need of our assistance and services, in 2014 38 per cent were not related to consular support at all. 'For example, one caller asked us to help find his son's missing suitcase - as it had apparently been lost by a British airline, the caller thought the British consulate would be able to locate it.' The FCO’s priority is to protect the welfare of British nationals abroad, and consular staff will always do their best to assist people when they find themselves in difficulty. On tourist in the Philippines rang the British Foreign Office to find out where they could get a roast dinner . However, it is important for travellers to understand what services we provide before getting in touch. There are also some simple pre-travel steps that you can take to reduce the risk of getting into difficulty and needing our help, such as taking out comprehensive travel insurance, researching the destination and any health risks and ensuring access to emergency funds.

"A NASCAR driver was forced to withdraw from a Sprint Cup series race this weekend after his car was stolen early Friday morning from a hotel parking lot. Travis Kvapil was supposed to drive the $250,000 Chevrolet race car for the small-budget Team XTREME but had to drop out of the race after missing a mandatory inspection. The No. 44 car was inside a trailer hitched to a black 2004 Ford pickup truck parked outside the team's hotel in Morrow, Georgia. The truck and trailer were driven out of the parking lot around 5:30am, just 15 minutes before the team was scheduled to leave for the Atlanta Motor Speedway, according to police. Travis Kvapil was forced to withdraw from a Sprint Cup series race this weekend after his car (pictured) was stolen early Friday morning from a hotel parking lot . Kvapil (pictured outside the Atlanta Motor Speedway on Friday) was supposed to drive the $250,000 Chevrolet race car for the small-budget Team XTREME . A crewman had been outside smoking a cigarette just a few minutes before the theft. In addition to the race car, the trailer also contained a spare engine valued at $100,000 and racing equipment valued at $17,500, according to a police report. Team Xtreme Racing owner John Cohen estimated the total value to be somewhere between $350,000 and $400,000. Kvapil said he was crushed that he now wouldn't have the opportunity to race in what would have been his first track appearance of 2015, calling it a 'big setback'. 'You can handle maybe getting a flat tire, or getting caught up in a wreck, or a blown engine, something that actually happens on the race track,' he said. 'Or you don't qualify, because you don't have enough speed. But to not even get a chance ... that's pretty disheartening.' The theft hit the small Team Xtreme Racing even harder, especially after they had wrecked a car in a Daytona 500 qualifying race just last week. Not only did the team have to work overtime to get a new car prepared for this weekend's race, the stolen car was Cohen's favorite. 'I just feel bad for my guys, they were really proud of this car,' he told ESPN. 'I called that car Old Faithful, because you could run that car anywhere and it would do good.' Kvapil said he was crushed that he now wouldn't have the opportunity to race in what would have been his first appearance of 2015, calling it a 'big setback' The car was inside a trailer hitched to a black 2004 Ford pickup truck (pictured) parked outside the team's hotel in Morrow, Georgia. The team's owner estimated it was carrying almost $400,000 worth of equipment . Kvapil tweeted about the theft, asking his followers to 'let me know' if they saw his car around. He also wrote: 'I bet when whoever has it, opens the trailer and is going to be like 'oh snap' The white trailer had no markings and Kvapil believes the person who stole it probably had no idea what they were really nabbing, he told ESPN. 'There's a lot of money inside that little trailer right now,' he said. 'For the team's sake and John Cohen's sake, hopefully the parts and pieces can be recovered or it will be a really huge setback.' Kvapil tweeted about the theft, asking his followers to 'let me know' if they saw his car around. He also wrote: 'I bet when whoever has it, opens the trailer and is going to be like 'oh snap''. Kvapil doubts the thieves would be able to make any money off of the car. 'There's really no use for it out in the general public. I don't really know what you can do with it.' 'I hope they realize that and will leave it somewhere where police can find it.' But even more than just the money, Kvapil told ESPN missing the race will hurt the team as the Sprint Cup series is determined by points per race. 'The beginning of the year, it's so important to establish yourself in the points, and they did a good job with a decent finish last week,' he said.

"Donald Graham murdered millionaire heiress Janet Brown and got his girlfriend to pose as her so he could steal hundreds of thousands of pounds from her family . The married lover of a millionaire heiress murdered her before getting his dinner lady girlfriend to pose as the dead woman so he could steal hundreds of thousands of pounds from her family. Donald Graham murdered Janet Brown in 2005 and went on to steal £585,000 from her estate, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle and pay for sports cars. After killing Miss Brown, with whom he had been in a long relationship despite being married to someone else, Graham got a third woman to pose as her so she could ask the dead woman's father for more cash. Miss Brown's body has not been found. After murdering Miss Brown, Graham plundered the dead woman's savings and sold her assets - which he used to treat himself to a Ferrari, a Porsche and an Alfa Romeo. He then turned his greedy intentions on her elderly parents and started siphoning their cash, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Days after murdering Miss Brown, he met school dinner lady Elizabeth Todd and used some of the stolen money to buy her a house. When the killer's string of lies looked like they were about to unravel, Graham convinced Todd, who was today sentenced for fraud, to write two letters to Miss Brown's father's bank, posing as the dead woman, to request a cash transfer into his account. The 52-year-old mother, who lived in a council flat before she met Graham, also made two telephone calls under the guise of Miss Brown to a care home where a friend of hers worked and left messages under the dead woman's name in a bid to keep up the claim she was still alive. Miss Brown vanished in May 2005 and Graham convinced her friends and loved ones she had moved away abroad to start a new life. It was almost a decade later, after both of her parents died, that the sad truth of what happened to her emerged. Graham is currently serving a life sentence, with a minimum term of 32 years, for her murder. After killing Miss Brown (left), Graham got his girlfriend Elizabeth Todd (right) to pose as her so she could ask the dead woman's father for more cash . Todd, of Seaton Deleval, North Tyneside, pleaded guilty to fraud and perverting the course of justice. Judge John Evans sentenced her to six months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, with supervision. The judge said: 'It is a tragic tale of repeated manipulation, naked exploitation, betrayal and greed which befell Janet Brown and ultimately her vulnerable parents at the hands of a ruthless killer. 'It ended with the untimely death, the cold-blooded murder, of Janet Brown. 'Your part in this appalling tale was, I accept, as do the crown, limited. 'It needs to be recognised, it is accepted you did not know the truth about Janet. Had you done so, had that been established, I would have had to approach the question of sentence on a very different basis.' Judge Evans said he accepted Todd was 'vulnerable and naïve' when she 'blindly carried out his directions'. Glen Gatland, defending, said Todd could have been preyed on by the callous killer because of her physical resemblance to Miss Brown. Mr Gatland said: 'There is evidence he tired to persuade Elizabeth Todd, very shortly after their first meetings, to have her hair dyed to the same colour.' The court heard Todd believed Graham, who would profess his 'love and devotion' to her, would one day marry her - a belief that was backed up when he bought two engagement rings. Mr Gatland added: 'He was a very, very skillful conman, he was able to lead Elizabeth Todd up the garden path. He is skillful at using women. 'Elizabeth Todd believed Janet Brown was overseas and working. She genuinely believed what Donald Graham was telling her.' Graham is currently serving a life sentence, with a minimum term of 32 years, for Miss Brown's murder . Graham, 60, who lived with his wife Denise, sent letters and cards to Miss Brown's parents after he killed her, claiming to be Janet and telling them she had settled in Europe. He then went about gaining the trust of her parents, giving him access to banking information and personal documents. After the death of Janet's mother, Graham even took her father shopping each week while defrauding the family of hundreds of thousands of pounds. During the murder trial, the court heard he created a fake will for Janet's elderly father Eric Brown, which would leave his estate - Plane Trees Estate, in Hexham, Northumberland, to Graham. Eric Brown's will originally left all of his assets to Janet, but in the circumstance that he outlived her everything would be left to the Guide Dogs for the Blind charity. The court how Janet Brown and Elizabeth Todd had both been listed as witnesses on the fake will in which Graham forged Eric Browns signature. Skipton Building Society noticed suspicious activity on Eric Brown's account in 2009 and stopped the transaction of a cheque from Eric Brown to Donald Graham's account. This led to Graham writing letters to the bank claiming to be Eric and Janet Brown, although they were both dead. Todd admitted writing two of the letters, claiming to be Miss Brown and requesting cash be transferred immediately. When Graham was interviewed by police he claimed he was the joint executor of Eric Brown's will with Janet Brown. Donald Graham, of Elsdon Avenue, Seaton Deleval, Northumberland, was charged with 19 offences in September 13, 2013, nearly four years after the investigation began. He was charged with murder, two counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, 13 counts of fraud, forgery, conspiracy to commit fraud and perverting the course of justice. Todd pleaded guilty to fraud and perverting the course of justice and was handed a suspended sentence at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) He first appeared at Newcastle Crown Court on September 17 2013 and pleaded not guilty to all charges on January 10 2014. Graham changed his plea on March 14 and admitted 18 fraud offences against Janet Brown and her parents. He denied murder and preventing the course of justice but a jury at Newcastle Crown Court found him guilty of both counts on June 19. The total amount that Graham gained during the fraud was £585,000. Janet Brown lived with her elderly parents Olive and Eric Brown in a converted barn on her parents estate Plane Trees Farm, near Hexham, Northumberland. She had been planning to go on holiday in June 2005 to France with Graham, her lover of eight years. Graham cancelled at the last minute falsely claiming his wife was too ill for him to leave her. Janet told a friend that Graham had 'let her down'. However Graham had secretly met another girlfriend - Todd - and was no longer interested in Janet Brown, only her finances. Janet disappeared before she went on holiday and has not been seen since.","Married Donald Graham murdered millionaire heiress Janet Brown in 2005 .

"Bungling Highway Patrol troopers mistakenly accused an elderly driver of stealing his own car after misreading his number plate. Sobbing, Robin Bruins had three guns pointed at him and was ordered to remove his shirt, before being handcuffed and hauled off to jail. He was driving his classic 1962 Chevy Impala in Las Vegas with his wife, Beverly, in the passenger seat when he was pulled over as part of a routine check. But the hapless Highway Patrol trooper misread the registration number leading to the vehicle showing up as using a plate belonging to an expired Harley Davidson. Scroll down for video .

"What colour is this dress? That was the question that sparked a fierce internet debate, with social media users, among them Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, arguing over its true hue. Now a new photo has emerged that looks set to end the row once and for all, and reveals that those who claimed it was blue and black are correct. In the picture, the dress is being worn by Cecilia Bleasdale, the mother of the bride, and is clearly blue and black rather than cream and gold. Scroll down for video . Real colour revealed: This photo shows that the dress - and the matching jacket - are clearly black and blue . What a wedding: Grace posed on her wedding day with another guest from the wedding . Now her family have claimed the experience of picture of the dress going viral has been, 'very weird.' Cecilia's daughter Grace married her husband Keir Johnston in Colonsay, Scotland, earlier this month with her mother choosing to wear the £50 dress from Roman Originals. Cecilia, who lives in Blackpool, had sent Grace a picture of the dress which she had then shared online. Family friend Caitlin McNeil, 21, then posted it to Tumblr after a debate broke out among their friends about what colour the dress was. It promptly went viral, with posts arguing over the dress's original colours - and science behind the debate - viewed and shared millions of times. Grace's sister Angie McPhee, 37, also from Blackpool, said: 'It's my mum's dress. It was my sister Grace's wedding on Colonsay.' 'Mum sent it to Grace to give the dress a thumbs up or thumbs down. 'It was sent originally to my sister then my mum sent the picture to me and Grace said 'Why is she wearing white and gold to the wedding? We were shocked my mum had chosen a light coloured dress.' Angie continued: 'Originally I saw it a white and gold. Grace saw it as white and gold - her fiance saw it as blue and black and they had a bit of a tadoo about it.' She continued: 'The actual dress is blue and black. Only that picture is different.' Saying their vows: Grace married her husband Keir in Scotland earlier this month her family have spoken out about the dress going viral . The happy day: One of Grace's friends has revealed that she has found the whole experience 'very weird' after waking up to messages and missed calls about the dress on her honeymoon . Lindsay Maden, 26, also from Blackpool, was a bridesmaid at the wedding. She said: 'It's mental. Grace showed me the original picture and she thought it was white and gold. 'Then we had the wedding and Caitlin posted it online. I can't comprehend it. For us it was literally like, 'that's a bit weird' and that was it. 'The dress was royal blue and as black as you can get. The wedding was brilliant, it was lovely.' Lindsay said she had sent a message to Grace in Jamaica, who told her she had received lots of missed calls and messages, adding: 'It's dead weird waking up and seeing my phone has gone mental.' Keir, the groom, posted to his Facebook: 'You know it's gonna be a strange day when you wake up and after 30 seconds of interneting can turn to Grace Johnston and say 'So Kim sees white and gold, but Kanye sees blue and black.' Indeed Kim and Kanye did weight in on the debate. Kim Kardashian asked her 29.4million Twitter followers to help settle a disagreement between herself and husband Kanye West. Unfortunately for Kim, Kanye has been proved correct by the new photo, while she has been left to eat humble pie. The astonishing spread of the dress debate has left Miss McNeill shocked, with the 21-year-old telling Business Insider that she never expected the photograph to go viral. 'I thought my followers on Tumblr would maybe have a good reaction but I never would have considered that Taylor Swift and Mindy Kaling would be tweeting about it.' First post: The photo was initially shared by Caitlin McNeill, 21, above, an aspiring singer from Scotland . Creating a buzz: Kim Kardashian called on her 29.4million Twitter followers to help settle a disagreement . 'Confused and scared': Taylor Swift told her Twitter followers that the dress is 'obviously blue and black' Star power: Celebrities including Mindy Kaling, B.J. Novak and Oscar-winner Julianne Moore join the debate . Miss McNeill also went on to reveal why she posted the snap in the first place and said that the original shot came from Mrs Bleasdale herself who bought the dress in high-street retailer Roman Originals. 'What happened was two of my close friends were actually getting married and the mother of the bride took a photo of the dress to send to her daughter,' she said. 'When my friend showed the dress to her fiancee, they disagreed on the colour. All of our friends disagreed.' With the debate fresh in her mind, Miss McNeill shared the photo on a Tumblr fan page dedicated to a talent manager Sarah Weichel. Then, without Weichel promoting the post or realising it was there, it went viral, with scores of celebrities getting involved in the argument. Kim Kardashian said: 'What color is that dress? I see white & gold. Kanye sees black & blue, who is color blind?' Actress Mindy Kaling also joined the discussion, writing on Twitter: 'IT'S A BLUE AND BLACK DRESS! ARE YOU F***ING KIDDING ME'. Even more colors: The dress can also be purchased in white and black or a pink and black combination . True colors: The dress, made by the company Roman Originals, is in fact blue and black striped . Her friend and fellow actor BJ Novak replied with a succinct post that simply read: 'white and gold.' Then recent Oscar winner Julianne Moore jumped in, writing to Novak and Kaling to complain: 'What's the matter with u guys, it's white and gold.' To that, Novak replied to Moore; 'Thank you! And congratulations on your Oscar, which Mindy thinks is purple and green.' Taylor Swift wrote; 'I don't understand this odd dress debate and I feel like it's a trick somehow. I'm confused and scared. PS it's OBVIOUSLY BLUE AND BLACK.' And Justin Bieber kept his fans happy by telling them, correctly as it turns out, that he sees 'blue and black'. Some celebrities avoided the issue completely and contented themselves by simply declaring the dress ugly. Model Chrissy Teigen told her 655,000 Twitter followers: 'F*** the dress it's heinous', while Oscar-winner Jared Leto branded it 'fugly'. With the release of the new photo, the bodycon dress, which is made by British company Roman Originals, has been definitively identified as being black and blue. There company also makes also white, pink and red options, all with black lace. There are, however, no white and gold versions to be had. On display: The dress is displayed in the window of the Roman Originals store, it also comes in different colours . Trying it on: A woman tried on the dress in the store today showing it to be blue and black . There's science behind the reason why some people see black on blue while others are just as certain that they see gold on white. The simple answer is that the picture is an optical illusion. Objects reflect light at certain wavelengths, or colors, and the human brain determines the color of an object by taking in its reflected light. But this perception can be thrown off balance by the color of nearby objects. With the photo of the dress, the surrounding colors are so muddled that the brain isn't sure what to make of the dress itself. As Wired.com points out, a digital analysis of the dress photo shows that one of the spots of black trim is actually orange in the photo. Thus, people who perceive the surrounding area as dark are likely to see the blue in the dress as white and the black colors as gold. It all just depends on the manner that the brain perceives and processes color. Jay Neitz, a University of of Washington neuroscience tells Wired: 'I've studied individual differences in color vision for 30 years, and this is one of the biggest individual differences I've ever seen.' He sees gold on white.","Colours of two-tone dress have become a topic of debate on social media .

"The Daily News, known as New York's hometown newspaper, and for its eye-catching front pages, is potentially up for sale . The New York Daily News could be up for sale, potentially signalling a new phase in the New York tabloid wars. Mort Zuckerman, the owner and publisher of the New York City tabloid newspaper, sent a memo to staff on Thursday that said he was approached about a potential sale a few weeks ago. The identity of the potential buyer is so far unknown. 'Although there were no immediate plans to consider a sale, we thought it would be prudent to explore the possibility and talk to potential buyers and/or investors,' Zuckerman wrote in the memo. He has hired the financial advisory firm Lazard to help with the process. Zuckerman, acquired the tabloid in 1993 and is a prominent real-estate investor. His spokesman Tom Goodman had no comment beyond the memo. The Daily News, known as New York's hometown newspaper, has the fifth largest circulation in the U.S., just behind the Los Angeles Times. Top of any list of potential buyers is News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch, owner of arch-rival tabloid paper The New York Post. There has been speculation over the years that Murdoch would be interested in buying the paper. Combining the two papers could produce a total readership of approximately one million.

Zuckerman said that the 'immense hard work in turning the business around in an extremely challenging period for the industry, has put the Daily News in as strong a position than it has ever been, particularly online.' I want to share with you a new development regarding the company. A few weeks ago, we were approached about our potential interest in selling the Daily News. Although there were no immediate plans to consider a sale, we thought it would be prudent to explore the possibility and talk to potential buyers and/or investors. To help us with the process, I have retained Lazard, a leading financial advisory firm. I have not come to this decision easily. But I believe the immense hard work in turning the business around in an extremely challenging period for the industry, has put the Daily News in as strong a position than it has ever been, particularly online. I appreciate that this news is difficult for you to digest. But I want to reassure you that my aim throughout this process will be to do the right thing for the business to ensure the Daily News and its brilliant staff have the best opportunity to achieve all our future ambitions. Mort . The newspaper industry has been suffering for years from declining print circulation and advertising revenue, as readership and ad dollars have shifted online. While online advertising is growing at many newspapers, this is not always enough to make up for the print losses. The Daily News recently announced it was closing its bureaus in the outer boroughs of New York to center operations in Manhattan. Existing editorial staff on the outer borough teams are being redeployed internally but will still focus on covering Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx and Staten Island. Borough staff had already been downsized in 2013, and savings will largely come from real estate and other operating costs. 'By reassigning our district team, we will be strengthening our opportunities to cover even more areas, particularly online,' managing editor for news Robert Moore told Capital New York. 'The Daily News is still wholeheartedly committed to covering borough news, and that will continue both in the paper and digitally.' Rumors have circulated for some time that the paper would eventually go digital-only. The Daily News was founded in 1919 and was the first U.S. daily printed tabloid. It has had a tumultuous history, having survived crippling strikes in 1982 and 1990; the death of then owner Robert Maxwell when he fell off his yacht at sea in 1991; bankruptcy; and being flooded out of its headquarters by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Its circulation has eroded from over 1 million papers a day to approximately 500,000 today.

"The most popular speaker at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference was not a politician, but rather Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson. Robertson received a thunderous applause that brought the audience to their feet Friday as he accepted the Andrew Breitbart Defender of the First Amendment Award. And in his remarks, that ran 20 minutes long, the polarizing reality star focused on one thing in particular - sexually transmitted diseases in America. Scroll down for video . Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson accepted the Andrew Breitbart Defender of the First Amendment Award at CPAC on Friday . In his speech, Robertson slammed hippies and their culture for causing the 110million cases of STDs in Americans . 'I hate to admit I got my facts from the CDC the day before yesterday, 110 million, 110 million Americans now have a sexually transmitted illness,' said Robertson. 'I don't want you, America, to get sick,' he added. 'I don't want you to become ill. I don't want you to come down with a debilitating disease. I don't want you to die early. You're disease free and she's disease free, you marry, you keep your sex right there. You won't get sick from a sexually transmitted disease.' Robertson then moved on to who he blamed for these diseases. 'It is the revenge of the hippies! Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll have come back to haunt us in a bad way,' he stated. He then went on to tell that audience that it only takes '30 seconds' to get genital herpes. Then, he said that the only way to end this was for a man to marry a woman or a woman to marry a man, and to stay faithful. 'You want a godly, biblical, medically safe option? One man, one woman, married for life,' he said. Robertson kicked off his speech by quoting one of the founding fathers, as he told the audience; 'You lose your religion, according to John Adams, and there goes your morality. We're almost there.' Robertson closed out his speech by saying; 'And if you hate me because I told you that, I told you my love for you is not contingent on how you feel about me. I love you anyway. I don't want to see you die early or get sick. I'm trying to help you, for crying out loud. America, if I didn't care about you, why would I bring this up? Robertson was joined by his wife as he received his award, Marsha Kay Robertson . Robertson brought his Bible up with him for his acceptance speech . Phil and Kay's son Willie sat in the audience as his father received his award . What Robertson failed to bring up however were his own infidelities. Robertson's wife Kay stayed with his despite his affairs, and the two recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. She too was there on Friday as her husband accepted his award, as was the couple's son Willie, who sat in the audience. Robertson, 68, is a devout Christian who made his millions inventing the Duck Commander, an instrument used by hunters that makes duck calls. He previously came under fire when he denounced homosexual as 'sinful in a 2013 interview with GQ. A&E, the network that airs Duck Dynasty, suspended him after these comments, but he was reinstated after the public, and politicians including Sarah Palin, attacked the move as a violation of his freedom of speech.","Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson accepted the Andrew Breitbart Defender of the First Amendment Award at CPAC on Friday .

"Situated near the beautiful Durham coastline among rolling green fields, they sound like a beautiful place to live. Yet homes in the once thriving villages of Horden and Blackhall stand empty and – even with a price tag of just £1 – have no buyer. Almost 160 terraced homes that snake through the villages are boarded up or entombed behind steel shutters. In fact, they outnumber the properties that still have ordinary doors and windows. Some of the empty properties are owned by private landlords but most are owned by a housing association. Accent housing association, which owns most of the houses, says it pulled millions of pounds of investment because there is no demand for two-bed homes following the introduction of the 'bedroom tax' Horden Beach, which is particularly good for fishing, is just down the road from many of the houses . The association, Accent, says it has withdrawn millions of pounds of regeneration cash from the villages – believing the homes cannot be let. It blames the so-called bedroom tax. Also known as the Spare Room Subsidy, the ‘tax’ is a change to housing benefit which means claimants receive less if they live in a housing association or council property with a spare bedroom. Accent offered to sell 130 homes to Durham County Council for just £1 each, but the council refused. However, residents blame the housing association for letting the area slide and say they are now plagued by rats. Pat Barnett of the Horden Colliery Residents’ Association said: ‘The quality of the houses has gone down – the Accent owned houses. They weren’t doing their repairs and people just moved out.’ The association says it offered 130 of the homes to Durham Council at just £1 each, but the council refused because people cannot afford to live in homes with a spare bedroom . Residents have said that the villages used to be nice places to live, but are now infested with rats . The street has been left with red graffiti and for sale signs as its only residents, and has been compared to Beirut in Lebanon . These boarded-up houses, many of which are on Twelfth Street, Horden, have also been compared to a 'disease' She said that no one wanted to live next to houses that were boarded up adding: ‘It’s just like a disease that’s spread down the streets.’ Things are likely to get even worse in the former mining villages with a further 100 households due to move out. Isabel Roberts, who has lived in the area for 38 years, told Channel 4 News: ‘These were lovely houses. Now it’s like Beirut. It’s absolutely disgraceful.’ Some of the houses, on Twelfth Street, are just two miles away from the beautiful north-east coastline . Things are likely to get even worse in the former mining villages with a further 100 households due to move out . The houses even have small courtyard gardens, which back on to narrow roads and alleyways . The Accent group says the introduction of the ‘bedroom tax’ has accelerated the town’s decline.

"The next phase of work on the Navy's largest ever warship is underway, with the upper decks of the huge vessel gradually taking form. Workers were seen on board HMS Queen Elizabeth in Rosyth Dock in Fife, some seven months after being first floated on the River Forth. She was unveiled by the Queen in 2014 after the ordinarily dry dock was flooded with water. The ship is Britain's largest ever maritime vessel weighing 65,000 tonnes and measuring 918ft from bow to stern. At almost 230ft, she stands as tall as Niagara Falls from the keel to the masthead. Scroll down for video . Work HMS Queen Elizabeth continues, with the ship's nine-deck hull taking form. The project is expected to cost more than £6billion with the vessel, docked at Rosyth in Fife, the largest in the Navy's history . Work began on the ship in 2007. By the time work is completed, the ship will have enough space to carry 36 F-35 Lightning fighter jets . Once completed she will have enough room to transport 36 F-35 Lightning fighter jets, though only three of the 48 ordered from U.S. manufacturers have so far been delivered. The ship's hull was beginning to take form today with some of its nine decks becoming visible. The cost of fitting out the ship has spiraled drastically since plans for its construction were revealed. In 2008 an initial contract for its completion was priced at £3.2billion. Two years later the bill was put at £5.2billion, with the most recent figures indicating it will cost more than £6billion to complete. Last summer 80,000 tons of steel, 3.4million yards of cabling and 90,000 pipe spools had already been used in its construction.  Among its features is a huge lifting platform which will be able to bring jets and helicopters to the flight deck in less than a minute. But since work began in 2007 an estimated 10,000 people have been employed in building the ship. Once in use she will employ a crew of fewer than 700. HMS Prince of Wales, a sister ship, is also undergoing extensive construction work. The vessels have been heralded by the Royal Navy as future flagships for the Armed Forces. From 2020, their primary use will be in transporting 36 F-35 Lightning fighter jets. Artists impressions of the ship's flight deck released before construction was underway. When completed the vessel will have enough room for dozens of aircraft . In July 2014 the warship was floated out of Rosyth Dock for the first time after it was filled with water. An estimated 10,000 people will have worked on her construction by the time it is complete . At 72,000 tons and 932 feet long, the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier is taller than Nelson’s Column and considerably wider than the M25 at its widest point . At 72,000 tons and 932 feet long, the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier is taller than Nelson’s Column and considerably wider than the M25 at its widest point. She generates enough energy to power Swindon, she can produce 500 tons of fresh water a day - and travel 500 miles a day, too. Above all, she will be able to deliver 36 F-35 Lightning strike fighters and 1,000 troops from the largest piece of British sovereign territory afloat. Her sister ship, the Prince of Wales, is already in production, though it has still not been decided whether she will be operational, mothballed or sold. Each ship, which has a life expectancy of around 50 years, will be fitted out with more than three million metres of cable and it will have enough power to light up a small town. This week, the Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond, described the project as a feat of engineering to match the London Olympics. You could say much the same about the price - more than £6 billion for the pair. And that does not include the planes. Each 65,000-tonne aircraft carrier will provide the armed forces with a four-acre military operating base, which can be deployed worldwide, operating the F-35 Lightning II and a number of types of helicopter. At full capacity, the carrier will be able to launch an aircraft every 30 seconds. They will be versatile enough to be used across the full spectrum of military activity, from war fighting to providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief. HMS Queen Elizabeth will have 679 permanent crew and capacity for 1,600 crew members when fully operational. The ship features a new style of 'twin island' command points - one at the front for steering and one at the back for aircraft direction. Thanks to the cutting-edge technology on board, commanders on the bridge will be able to see 250 miles away. The carrier's range is said to be 10,000 nautical miles and the ship is fitted with a long range 3D radar that is capable of tracking more than 1,000 targets at once or spotting a tennis ball travelling at 2,000 miles per hour. Until then however the ships, which each have 4-acre hangar decks, will carry helicopters. Sea trials are expected to begin next year, the Royal Navy's website predicts. Experts at BAE Systems working on the carriers created an app - called Platform Navigation - to assist them in finding their way around the unprecedented scale and complexity of the ships, where even routine journeys can take up to 20 minutes. Speaking before it was unveiled for the first time in July, senior naval officer Captain Simon Petitt said: 'What we will get as the United Kingdom is the most amazing piece of military capability that really will be flexible and be able to provide our politicians and our military planners with choice, depending on what comes in the future. 'They provide a real joint defence asset to deliver air power using the freedom of the world’s oceans to influence what happens on land.' HMS Queen Elizabeth in all her glory: An artists impression reveals the decks of new 65,000-ton Royal Navy warship that will be able to carry 2,300 crew and enough space to transport 36 F-35 Lightning fighter jets . The massive vessel will be as long as twenty eight London buses which is three times bigger than Britain's previous biggest aircraft carriers . Since work began in 2007, an estimated 10,000 shipyard workers and engineers have been employed in building the ship which will employ a crew of fewer than 700 once complete . Reflecting on the construction work carried out to this point, he added: 'It’s just fantastic. I arrived here over a year ago and there was one relatively small block in the dock. 'The ship now is structurally complete and it’s been really exciting watching her come together. My crew are just as excited and proud as I am.' The Queen Elizabeth Class Carriers are part of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, a joint venture between BAE Systems, Thales UK, Babcock and the UK Ministry of Defence. Project manager Steven Carroll, the systems delivery director for the Alliance, said: 'It’s a huge undertaking, a UK-wide national endeavour involving up to 10,000 people, including multiple companies within the alliance and the supply chain. 'It really has been a long journey, a fantastic journey, to get to this point and there is a lot more work to be done as we get ready for the second ship, Prince of Wales.' Six shipyards around the UK have been involved in the project to build the HMS Queen Elizabeth which is currently based at huge Rosyth Docks in Scotland . Last summer 80,000 tons of steel, 3.4million yards of cabling and 90,000 pipe spools had already been used in the construction of the ship and work is still underway to bring the project in on its estimated £6.2billion budget .

"A record number of Britons are now saving into a work pension, official figures show. Six in 10 people are now saving into a workplace pension pot, up from half three years ago. The rapid increase means there are now 2.7million more people in pensions than just 12 months earlier, bringing the total to 15.7million. This is the highest level since records began in 1997, and follows a Government scheme launched in 2012 which forces employers to enrol staff into a pension. Increase: There are now 2.7million more people in pensions than just 12 months earlier, bringing the total to 15.7million . The worker can then opt out of this, although few have. The latest pension figures show that this automatic enrolment has helped to reverse a long-term decline in people taking out pensions. However, the annual survey from the Office for National Statistics also showed that fewer workers were being offered gold-plated final salary pensions than ever before. These valuable schemes now represent less than half of all workplace pensions – the first time this has occurred since records began. The figures also showed that public sector workers received far higher contributions from their employer than private sector staff, meaning they will retire on far more generous pensions. Minister for Pensions, Steve Webb, said: 'The rise in the proportion of people saving for retirement over the past three years is stunning. Pension saving is now at its highest level since records began. Bucking the trend: The latest pension figures show that this automatic enrolment has helped to reverse a long-term decline in people taking out pensions . 'This is due in no small part to the success of automatic enrolment which is changing the culture of pension saving in Britain. 'Millions more people are now saving into a workplace pension, allowing them to build a decent nest egg to enjoy in their retirement, on top of a reinvigorated new State Pension.'","15.7million people now enrolled in pensions, after 2.7million rise in 12 months .

"As far as aeroplane stowaways go, this could be one of the cutest ever. Employees at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, received a surprise when they found a baby squirrel which had sneaked onto a plane. The critter was apprehended by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials earlier this month after it survived a flight from Costa Rica, a journey that normally takes about three to four hours. Passengers had already disembarked when the squirrel was found after a flight from Costa Rica to Houston . Passengers had already disembarked when the squirrel was found by workers who were preparing the plane for its next flight. A CBP officer and agricultural specialist boarded the aircraft and ‘caged the squirrel without incident,’ the agency said in a news release. CBP Port Director Charles Perez said: ‘During the course of performing our mission, we may encounter unusual opportunities to aid in the capture of seemingly harmless animals that have hitchhiked into the country. ‘While there is a cute factor here, realistically, we understand that animals must be handled carefully.’ The CBP’s office in Central Texas tweeted a photo that showed an employee, wearing a glove, clutching the furry stowaway after it was discovered. It said: ‘#CBP rescued this baby squirrel that arrived aboard an aircraft @iah; He’s in capable hands @USFWS_Southwest.’ Aircraft employees found the squirrel when they were preparing the plane for its next flight (file photo) US Customs and Border Protection handed the squirrel over to a US Fish and Wildlife Service inspector . The animal, which boasts rust-coloured fur, was quarantined and given food and water until it was handed over to a US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) inspector. The USFWS is working with the Houston Zoo to find an appropriate home for the squirrel. It’s not the first time a squirrel has been discovered on a Texas-bound flight. In 2007 an American Airlines flight from Tokyo to Dallas was forced to make an unscheduled landing in Honolulu, Hawaii, after pilots heard ‘skittering’ noises in the space above the cockpit. They suspected it was an animal and decided to land the plane because they feared the animal could have chewed through important wires. Authorities euthanised the squirrel over fears it may have been infected with rabies.","Passengers had already disembarked when the squirrel was discovered .

"Judge Roderic Wood ruled that the boy must stay in the UK to be close to his father after agreeing that video calls were no substitute for physical contact . A mother who wanted to relocate to Hong Kong taking her son with her and leaving the father behind in England has had her request turned down because 'you can't hug Skype'. The mother of the two-year-old boy said the child could stay in contact with his father using phone calls, internet video calls, and visits. However, the man argued that visiting Hong Kong regularly was impractical, and that internet services were often unreliable and didn't substitute for physical contact. And at the High Court today Judge Roderic Wood said the plan was inadequate because 'you can't hug Skype', adding that he did not believe the mother would stick to her commitments. Mr Justice Wood added: ‘The disadvantages of Skype - as any user will know - are all too often the lack of clarity of image, the sound delay even if short and, as counsel colourfully notes in her closing submissions, ""You can’t hug Skype"".’ Rejecting the mum’s case, he continued: ‘This is a case where a father, despite obstacles, has built up a very good and profound attachment to his son. ‘The mother’s proposals to relocate - even if her proposals for visits, telephone calls and Skype calls are carried out - in practice do not make up for these losses. ‘For the avoidance of doubt, I do not believe this mother once in Hong Kong, if given permission, would adhere to the contact regime pre-figured in her case. ‘Even if I am wrong about that and she started the programme, it would, having seen her and heard her, only in my view be a matter of time before this regime faltered and collapsed. ‘I simply did not, in the light of my findings...believe her as to her intentions.’ Sitting at London's High Court, Mr Justice Woods added that, even if the difficulties with Skype could be resolved, he did not believe that the mother would keep in contact with the father . He continued: ‘Both these parents are capable of raising [the child] physically and of giving him physical care and nurture. ‘It is the mother’s inability to recognise in any real way the value to [the child] of having his father in his life and to facilitate and encourage it which leads me to find that in reality she would let [the child’s] opportunities for continuing and developing his relationship with his father wither or even cease abruptly.’ The decision means the  boy will stay in England, where he can have direct contact with his father.","Mother planned move to Hong Kong and wanted to take two-year-old son .

"A father bidding to be a Ukip MP has been barred from taking his children to its meetings by a judge who warned they were at risk of ‘emotional damage’. At a custody hearing held behind closed doors, she told the candidate many people do not like the party, leaving the youngsters at risk of witnessing hostility from opponents. The judge told the family court hearing in the South of England that her fears included the possibility of somebody throwing something at the youngsters. The father, who cannot be identified, said he was asked if he would undertake not to take his children to party events. After he refused, he said the judge made an order to stop them being involved in any political activity. The father (pictured), who cannot be named, has been barred from taking his children to Ukip meetings . Last night, the dad said he felt ‘stigmatised’ and claimed the judge had been ‘blinded by prejudice’ towards his party. ‘I feel deeply insulted,’ he said. ‘I have been treated like a criminal. A parent should be allowed to bring up their child using common sense and not have that interfered with by a judge. ‘I was astonished during the discussion about my children’s holidays when the judge became animated on hearing they had attended Ukip meetings. ‘The judge made several remarks that I regarded as anti-Ukip and asked if I would undertake not to take them again. Of course I refused. She claimed the children were at risk of “emotional damage” if they attended Ukip events. ‘She went on to pass an order banning me from taking them on political activities.’ The candidate said the judge told him there are a lot of people with very strong feelings about Ukip including many who are ‘dead against’ the party. ‘She told me my children could be exposed to hostile reactions that could cause emotional harm,’ he added. ‘I was gobsmacked. ‘This is not based on any law, but a judge’s politically correct view. All political parties have gatherings, they all do street stalls, have public events, a lot of children go on marches with protesters. Two years ago, a couple in Rotherham had their three much-loved Eastern European foster children taken away on the grounds their membership of Ukip meant they supported ‘racist’ policies . ‘There are hundreds of politicians and party members up and down the country taking children to political events all the time. I cannot see why I have been singled out.’ The father said the order ‘seems to be motivated by the judge’s distinct prejudices against Ukip and perceiving it as a hazard’. He added: ‘The judge seemed to think people are very angry about Ukip as if there’s something wrong with it. I find that very belittling. We’re a mainstream political party. ‘Millions of people support Ukip. How can she imply that these people are on an extreme fringe and that I am taking children into a dangerous situation? It’s absurd. ‘I see this as an attack on normal family life and on Ukip. I know I have not done anything wrong but am being treated with contempt. ‘It is interfering with how I bring up my children. Parents should be left alone to bring up their family according to common sense. ‘We are told what to do, what to think and how to run our lives. I am deeply concerned.’ Today at an appeal hearing the father will argue that hostile behaviour and foul language are more likely to be experienced at football games than during campaigning. He will challenge the order on the grounds that it interferes with his right to family life by unnecessarily impeding how he chooses to bring up his children day-to-day. The father said his youngsters had attended party events like rallies and joined him as he took part in campaigning such as leafleting. But he insisted he would never take them to anything where he thought they were at any risk. ‘I’m careful with my children, what they eat and where they go. I’m a good parent,’ he said. ‘My children are wonderful and adorable and I’m always mindful of them. There has been no incident where I showed a lack of common sense. There was nothing untoward. I would never take my children to anything hazardous or pressurised where they would feel uncomfortable. If you are out with your children, you are always vigilant.’ Two years ago, a couple in Rotherham had their three much-loved Eastern European foster children taken away on the grounds their membership of Ukip meant they supported ‘racist’ policies. ■ Ukip leader Nigel Farage has asked for a police bodyguard for the election campaign. A source said he is being subjected to ‘physical and verbal abuse’ by protesters. Officials will assess his request.","Father bidding to be Ukip MP barred from taking his children to meetings .

As the sporting range did not sell well compared with military outfits - probably as children preferred to keep Action Man soldiering - ironically those are the lines most sought after by collectors now, due to their rarity. Mr Carpenter, who has a brother, said: 'I am flabbergasted that this is worth anything like this amount. 'We played with these and we found a case of ours and they were all ripped to bits. We would have played with most of them. We had lots of friends coming round to play. 'To be honest, we didn't really appreciate it at the time. It was only later on we realised how lucky we were having all these toys to play with.'

"The war medals proudly worn by a Normandy veteran who broke out of his care home so he could attend last year's D-Day commemorations in France are being sold. Bernard Jordan was nicknamed the Great Escaper after he absconded from his carers, caught a ferry to Caen and turned up in Normandy for the 70th anniversary events with his service awards pinned to his blazer. He passed away aged 90 on December 30 and seven days later his widow, Irene, passed away. With no immediate family, the couple left his £600,000 estate to lifeboat charity the RNLI.

Mr Jordan's campaign medals are to be sold at auction - and they could fetch thousands of pounds . Now his campaign medals are to be sold at auction - and they could fetch thousands of pounds. Mr Jordan was a 19-year-old Royal Navy lieutenant when on June 6, 1944, he was on a tank landing craft that was in the first wave of boats to hit the Normandy beaches. He had already taken part in the Battle of the Atlantic, the cat-and-mouse conflict between Allied ships and German U-boats over the vital supply routes from Europe to the United States. At one stage he was part of the boarding party that captured one of the Enigma coding machines, used by the Nazis to scramble messages, from an enemy submarine. He also served in the Italian campaign, supplying troops fighting their way north in an attempt to drive the Nazis from Europe. Following the war Mr Jordan got into local politics and served as a town councillor for 23 years in his hometown of Hove, East Sussex. Mr Jordan got a friendly reception when he arrived in Normandy from Adele Leatham and Julie Maguire . The hero enjoyed posing with fans following his fame but remained humble throughout, insisting: 'There were a lot of other people on the beaches of Normandy that day, this lovely attention is for them really, not me' Great Escape D-Day vet Bernard Jordan in Ouistream, Normandy, at the Grand Bunker museum . He was a a city councillor for two years and was mayor of the town from 1995 to 1996. Mr Jordan hit headlines in June last year when he went missing from his care home the day before the 75th anniversary D-Day celebrations. He slipped out of The Pines care home in Hove, East Sussex, telling carers he was going for a walk. In reality, he caught a ferry to Caen in Normandy and made his own way to the service. Police meanwhile had launched a missing persons appeal which was only called off when Mr Jordan called home to tell everyone he was ok. On his return Mr Jordan was made an honorary alderman of Brighton and Hove and on his 90th birthday he was inundated with 2,500 cards from wellwishers around the world. He died on December 30 last year, a week before Irene passed away. More than 150 mourners turned out to pay their respects to Mr Jordan at a joint funeral service for him and Irene held in Brighton on January 30.

She also resides at the home where lived in Hove, East Sussex, up until his death. Staff said Mr Jordan died peacefully in hospital . The RNLI said the legacy came as a 'huge surprise' but believed the couple's admiration stemmed from Mr Jordan's time in the Royal Navy in the Second World War. Charity chief executive Paul Boissier said last month: ''Bernard's story charmed the nation last year when he journeyed from his Sussex care home to France to commemorate the D-Day landings. 'I am delighted that the couple chose to leave us this sizeable donation, and their contribution, like those of Bernard's veteran peers, will never be forgotten.' Auctioneers at Wallis and Wallis in Lewes, East Sussex, say they are expecting lots of interest in the sale of Mr Jordan's medals from the UK and Europe, which has been brought by solicitors acting for his estate. The set comprises of the 1939-1945 Star, the Atlantic Star with French and German clasp, the Italy Star, the Defence Medal and the War Medal. Mr Jordan was a 19-year-old Royal Navy lieutenant when on June 6, 1944, he was on a tank landing craft that was in the first wave of boats to hit the Normandy beaches . Upon his return to the UK following his trip to France, Mr Jordan received thousands of cards and gifts . He was clapped and cheered by staff at Pines Care Home in Hove, East Sussex, after returning from France . The official estimate is £200 to £300 pounds but experts say the medal set could sell for thousands. A spokesman for the auction house said: 'Bernard Jordan was a wonderful chap who really embodied the great British bulldog spirit. 'He proudly served his country both during the war as a Navy officer and afterwards as a councillor. 'Bernard really captured the nation's imagination when he escaped his care home and travelled to France to be part of the D-Day memorial last year. 'Medals such as these would normally only fetch a few hundred pounds but Bernard became something of a celebrity following his Normandy adventure and his set could sell for much more.' The sale will be held on March 17. Bernard Jordan said he served on a destroyer in the Second World War hunting the 'wolf packs' of Nazi U-boats attacking Allied shipping convoys. 'I was once on a mission to recover one of the Enigma machines from a U-boat which we'd forced to the surface by dropping depth charges, and crippling it,' the 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran told friends. 'We boarded the submarine and recovered the machine.' Exactly which ship he was serving on at the time was not clear, but the successful British mission to seize the German code machines and their codebooks has been credited with changing the course of the war. Mr Jordan proudly wore his medals every day up until his death and spoke fondly of his time in the Navy . The first machine was seized by HMS Bulldog off Iceland in May 1941 when U-110 was forced to the surface and a boarding party seized the machine. In another incident a few months later, HMS Petard sent a boarding party on board a U-boat, but two British sailors were drowned when the submarine sank. Captured machines were taken to codebreakers at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire where they were able to intercept reams of encrypted German signals for years. Up until his death, Mr Jordan - who captured the nation's hearts after sneaking out of his care home and boarding a coach to France to join in D-Day anniversary events - proudly wore his Atlantic Star medal.

"Archaeologists have discovered an ancient Mayan mural that could contain one of the earliest examples of 'photobombing'. The painting, which dates to around 600-900AD, was found during excavations of ruins in the Mayan city of Xultun in the rainforests of Peten in north-west Guatemala. Using digital scanning techniques to enhance the fading paint on the interior walls of a half buried building in Xultan, scientists found it featured a ruler of the city seated on a throne in front of kneeling attendants and scribes. However, behind the seated ruler - who is dressed lavishly in a huge headdress - is another figure, seen poking their head out from behind their lord. The figure of an attendant peeking out from behind the throne of the ruler in this recreation of a 1,250 year old mural discovered in the Mayan city of Xultan could be the earliest example of a photobomb discovered . Researchers at Boston University and Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York, who excavated the discovery said it was extremely rare to find figures standing behind a ruler in this way in Mayan art. The person is thought to be a courtly attendant who may actually be helping to dress the ruler. Speaking to Livescience, Dr William Saturno, an archaeologist at Boston University who led the research, said: 'It's like a photobomb. He's almost like - ""do you see me here?""' A huge Maya dam uncovered by archaeologists is thought to have provided filtered drinking water to the great Mayan city of Tikal. The dam found at the site of Tikal in northern Guatemala, stretched more than 260 feet and stood 33 feet high. It is thought to have held about 20 million gallons of water in a man-made reservoir. The discovery in 2012 shed light on the lifestyles of the ancient Maya water and land-use systems at Tikal, located in northern Guatemala. It shows how the Maya conserved and used their natural resources to support a highly complex society for over 1,500 years despite environmental challenges, including periodic drought. Tikal is thought to have been inhabited by between 60,000 to 80,000 people. Researchers believe that the mural could also be depicting a meeting of a guild or organisation of mastercraftsman or scribes as they take part in a ceremony with their king. Dr Heather Hurst, an archaeological artist at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York and an honorary research associate at the University College London, who reconstructed the paintings, said: 'This is not a formal portrait of the king at all as if it had been he would have been depicted alone. 'This is about courtly life and how it worked.' She said that the peeking figure may even have been put there to add a little humour to the image. 'I wouldn't put it past them at all,' she said. 'However there are similar murals from around the same time that also depict servants helping a prince getting dressed.' The murals were first discovered in 2010 by an undergraduate student called Maxwell Chamberlain while he was inspecting a hole made by looters. He noticed faint traces of paint on an exposed area of interior wall and as the archaeologists examined it they found it was far more extensive. After careful excavation they discovered the painting extended around three walls of the 63 square foot room (5.94 square metres). Dr Hurst said that they believe the room may have been the work space or studio for a group of artists working for the king. They also discovered the skeleton of a man buried beneath the behind the murals - possibly one of the scribes depicted in the 1,250-year-old mural. This photo of the hidden mural above shows one of the seated figures from the west wall on the left and the ruler on his throne on the far right. Between them is a kneeling man who is labelled as a junior obsidian . This map shows where the mural was discovered in a ruined building in the Mayan city of Xultan, Guatamala . Dr Hurst said: 'A lot of effort and passion has been put into the painting. I have illustrated and excavated a lot of artworks but I have never seen such a carefully painted mural. 'The calligraphy alone is stunning.' The mural, which has been painted on the mud-based plaster that covered the walls, shows 11 figures on the west, north and east walls. Sadly any paintings that had been on the south wall had been obliterated by the looters when they broke into the building. Using digital scanning the scientists were able to map the mural and enhance the painting, allowing it to be studied in detail for the first time. The figure poking out from behind the throne being examined by a researcher on the right of the picture above, is not immediately obvious but scientist spotted it with digital scanning techniques to study the mural . Red, orange blue and black pigments used to produce the vibrant mural (shown above) have faded over time . Dr Hurst said the room would have been covered in vibrant red, blue, green and black colours. While some of these pigments were local to the Xultun region, others like the bright blue and green used to paint the ruler were probably imported, said the researchers. She said that the portrait of the ruler may also have been covered with some sort of curtain most of the time. She said: 'We found holes in the wall around that suggests that part of the wall may well have been covered for much of the time. 'This would have put the attention clearly on the scribes. What is interesting is that the doorway that would have been on the south wall was slightly offset to the left. 'This would have framed the whole mural and shows the spotlight was not just on the ruling figure.' According to the researchers, the architecture of the building where the murals were found suggests the focal point of the artwork was the central portion on the north wall, where the figure sitting on a throne is depicted and the scribe is kneeling before him. Three seated figures on the west, thought to be taaj, or obsidians who are members of a ritual order, face north towards the central scene. Similarly the figures on the poorly preserved east wall also appear to be facing towards the scene on the north wall. The building was found during excavations of mounds that cover old residences in the rain forest of Peten . Kneeling in front of the figure on the throne is a figure labelled 'itz'in taaj', which means junior obsidian and is gesturing with his left hand. The seated lord wears a large, blue green feathered headdress and holds a staff in his right hand, etched with wind symbols, and a incense bag in his left. Maya kings were known to often dress up as deities in re-enactments of events from the mythic past. The figure peeking out behind him, labelled as individual eight by the researchers, is thought to be helping hold up the headdress. Writing in the journal Antiquity, Dr Saturno and his colleagues said: 'It is very likely that the Xultun mural is in fact a group portrait made by the scribal-priests themselves. 'The mural establishes a direct relationship between a particular order, or guild, of Xultun artists and scribal-priests and their lord, and it celebrates its members’ achievement in consulting and producing work for their sovereign’s reign. This illustration shows how the mural may have looked inside the building at the time when it was created . The faint outline of figures on the west wall of the building can also be seen in the image above . 'Additional texts accompanying the scene affirm that the portrayed rule is indeed impersonating a wind deity. 'Individual eight leans out from behind the ruler's headdress, perhaps in the process of dressing the seated lord. 'He is labelled as baah tz'am, a title carried by particular courtly attendants. 'It is rare to find the title explicitly paired with an attendant behind a ruler's throne - more commonly these figures remain unnamed in court scenes.' The researchers claim that the mural is particularly valuable as it is one of only two found in the eastern Maya lowlands. Dr Hurst said: 'Murals like this are rare due to the humid climate in the tropics - they just are not preserved that well, especially one of this antiquity. 'It really is an outstanding discovery. But perhaps more exciting is the context - it is in an ordinary residence rather than a temple or court. 'Adjacent to this room there have been living spaces, areas for cooking and pantries found, but it looks like this room had a specific purpose.'","Scientists found paint flecks on walls of building smashed open by looters .

"The new Brains, Parker and Lady Penelope from the upcoming Thunderbirds Are Go! series have been unveiled - but the characters' looks are not quite what was expected. All three have been given a makeover for the modern age - but have ended up looking eerily similar to some famous faces. The revamped Lady Penelope looks dramatically younger than the original version, while her blonde bob haircut has been replaced by a shoulder-length do, more akin to that of Paris Hilton or Taylor Swift. Scroll down for video . The new Lady Penelope (left) and Parker (right) have been unveiled by ITV for the new Thunderbirds Are Go! But the digital makeovers made the characters look more like Paris Hilton (left) and Noel Gallagher (right) Nick Wilson, former Channel 5 director of children's programmes and now a producer and script editor, said the new-look Lady Penelope might 'ruffle a few feathers'. He said: 'There is an increasing tendency today to make girl characters more tomboyish, to put them in dungarees. Broadcasters don't want them to be butch but they don't want them to be too girly. They want stronger role models for girls. 'But Lady Penelope is a pretty strong role model so you can't just go on looks, it's what underneath that counts. Let's see how she turns out three or four episodes in. We have only seen a glimpse.' Brains, who traditionally always donned a bow tie and blue spectacles, has kept the snazzy glasses but now has an open neck shirt, giving him an uncanny resemblance to comedian Alan Carr. Meanwhile, Parker the chauffeur appears to have aged incredibly well and, with his casual jumper and black coat look, has similarities to Noel Gallagher. Earlier this month, ITV caused a stir when it unveiled the new-look Tracy brothers from International Rescue. Meanwhile, the new-look Brains (left) has an uncanny resemblance to funnyman Alan Carr (right) The first look at the CGI enhanced Tracy brothers (left to right - Scott, Virgil, Alan, Gordon and John) didn't go down as well as expected as fans compared them to a boyband . The most noticeable difference with the brothers comes in the form of their new outfits. Ditching their trademark hats, the men now have metro-sexual haircuts with the help of styling wax. Their pilots' suits have also been swapped for lyrca while their sashes have been given a massive gadget upgrade. At the time many fans reacted angrily on social networking site Twitter, with one writing: ‘Thunderbirds are meant to be puppets. Nothing more, nothing less.’ Another joked: ‘Is That 1D Or The Thunderbirds?!’ and another wrote: ‘One Direction a bunch of puppets, well the new Thunderbirds adds evidence to this theory.’ ITV has confirmed Gone Girl star Rosamund Pike will be voicing Lady Penelope, while Fonejacker and Four Lions star Kayvan Novak will provide the voice for Brains. Game of Thrones and Love Actually actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster will voice John Tracy. The characters appear to be much younger than the original counterparts. Pictured: Parker (left) and Brains (right) How they were: The original series was made up of puppets whereas the remake relies heavily on CGI . Actor David Graham, who voiced Gordon Tracy, Brains, Parker and Kyrano in the original Thunderbirds, will return as the voice of Parker. One episode of Thunderbirds are Go is written by David Baddiel and will feature Sylvia Anderson, who voiced Lady Penelope in the original series, . Thunderbirds was turned into a live-action film in 2004, but the Hollywood production was poorly received by fans and critics. ITV have promised that the new show will 'deliver a new level of action-adventure animation whilst also paying tribute to the classic 1960’s phenomenon.' The new series is a co-production between ITV Studios and New Zealand-based Pukeko Pictures in association with the Weta Workshop, the team behind The Lord of the Rings and Avatar.","Lady Penelope looks much younger and has a haircut like Paris Hilton .

"A high school honor roll student encouraged her friend to kill himself before raising thousands of dollars for suicide prevention, according to authorities. Michelle Carter, 18, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Conrad Roy III, who died of carbon monoxide poisoning in his idling truck in Fairhaven, Massachusetts last July. When Roy texted Carter that he wasn't sure he should take his life and had climbed out of the vehicle, she allegedly texted him: 'Get back in.' Carter, who was 17 at the time of Roy's suicide, was indicted on February 5 and arraigned on an involuntary manslaughter charge the next day in New Bedford Juvenile Court. The high school senior was charged as a youthful offender, which means her case is open and she could face punishment as an adult if convicted. She is free on bail and is due back in court in April. Accused: Michelle Conrad, pictured left, allegedly knew that her friend Conrad Roy III, right, was suicidal but rather than seeking help, she encouraged him to take his life in the minutes before he died last July . Police and prosecutors say Carter, of Plainville, texted back-and-forth with Conrad before he took his life in the parking lot of a Fairhaven Kmart on July 13, 2014. Court documents show the two friends exchanged more than 1,000 text messages  in the days leading up to his death, the Fairhaven Neighborhood News reported. Before his suicide, Conrad told her he was scared and not ready to leave his family, according to a police report, but 'she continued to encourage him to take his own life', theSun Chronicle reported. 'When he actually started to carry out the act, he got scared again and exited his truck, but instead of telling him to stay out of the truck ... Carter told him to ""get back in"",' the police report said. His body was found in the truck after his parents reported him missing, and police found the text messages after looking through his phone. Gregg Miliote, a spokesperson for Bristol County District Attorney Quinn, said in a statement on Thursday that Carter knew he was having suicidal thoughts. Tribute: In the hours after he was found dead, Carter shared this message to her Twitter page . 'Duplicitous': Three days after she allegedly encouraged him to take his life, she questioned why he had died . Cold: She also shared messages calling for suicide prevention, while paying tribute to her friend . 'Instead of attempting to assist him or notify his family or school officials, Ms. Carter is alleged to have strongly influenced his decision to take his own life, encouraged him to commit suicide and guided him in his engagement of activities which led to his death,' Miliote said. Quinn will not be overseeing the case because he knows the girl's family, he added. After the death, Carter, who attends King Philip Regional High School, started raising money and awareness for suicide prevention and organized a fundraising softball tournament last September. In a description for the event, 'Homers for Conrad', Carter wrote: 'Life can be tough, but helping others makes it easier.' She later wrote on Twitter that the event had raised $2,300. Carter has also repeatedly posted online about how much she misses her friend. 'Such a beautiful soul gone too soon,' she wrote on the day of his death. 'I'll always remember your bright light and smile. You'll forever be in my heart, I love you Conrad.' Most recently, just two days before her arraignment, she shared this image of Conrad, adding: 'Really missing you tonight'. She is free on bail but has been ordered not to touch her social media pages . Victim: Roy, 18, was a boat captain at his father's company and was about to start college when he died . Three days later, she added: 'I will never understand why this had to happen.' '1 month without your goofy humor and genuine love,' she later wrote. 'I miss you every day. I hope you're finally happy up there Co.' On September 10, 2014, she posted: 'National Suicide Awareness day, I wish more people understood. I love you and miss you everyday Conrad. Help others #WeCanEndSuicide.' Her most recent message - written just two days before her indictment - reads: 'Enjoy the parade from up there tomorrow Conrad, I know you would of loved to be there ♥ Really missing you tonight.' As conditions of her bail, she is not allowed to use the internet or social media and cannot text anyone but her parents. She is due back in court for a pretrial hearing on April 17. According to The Plainville Times, the teenager was also a founding member of 'Connect-To-Cure', a fundraiser selling $10 bracelets to raise funds for cancer patients at Boston Children's Hospital. Three weeks after she was arraigned, she went to the hospital to take part in a charity event. Her lawyer told The Standard Times that Carter did not commit a crime and expects the charge to be dismissed. Free: Carter, a high school senior who's on the honor role, has been charged as a youthful offender, which means her case is open and she could face punishment as an adult if convicted . 'I can't understand why they brought the charge,' Joseph P. Cataldo said. 'They're trying to claim there is manslaughter, when they freely admit the boy took his own life. You can't have it both ways.' King Philip Regional School District declined to comment on the case. 'The circumstances surrounding this tragic loss are under investigation,' Superintendent Elizabeth Zielinski told CBS Boston. 'Our deepest sympathy is extended to the family and school community of Conrad Roy.' Conrad Roy had graduated from Old Rochester Regional High School, where he was an all-around athlete who played baseball, rowed crew and ran track, according to an obituary. He had earned his captain's license from Northeast Maritime Institute and worked for his family's marine salvage business. He was planning to attend Fitchburg State University. His father, Conrad Roy Jr., was on a tug boat that came to the rescue of victims of US Airways Flight 1549 that crashed in the Hudson River in 2009, the Sun Chronicle reported.","Michelle Carter 'sent Conrad Roy III, 18, a series of texts encouraging to take his life in a parking lot in Fairhaven, Massachusetts last July'

"Boris Johnson today lashed out at Home Secretary Theresa May for watering down strict anti-terror powers which may have helped ISIS executioner Mohammed Emwazi escape the net and travel to Syria. The London Mayor accused his Tory leadership rival of giving the 'benefit of the doubt' to terror suspects like Emzawi – identified yesterday as the London-raised ISIS executioner known until now as 'Jihadi John'. Mr Johnson's astonishing attack comes amid growing controversy over who is to blame for MI5's failure to stop 'known wolf' Emwazi leaving Britain for the front line in Syria in 2013. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson today lashed out at the Home Secretary Theresa May for making it easier for terrorists like Mohammed Emwazi to escape justice . The extremist, who was brought up in west London, was subject to a no fly order and was on a terror watch list but still managed to leave without detection. He was a 'person of interest' to MI5 as a member of a cell known as The London Boys, which was set up in 2007 to recruit and raise funds for Somalia-based terror group al Shabab. The Government's independent reviewer of terror legislation David Anderson today admitted MI5 may have 'slipped up'. But he said: 'One won't know until there's been an inquiry or a report of some kind.' London's police chief this afternoon defended MI5, adding: 'You can't plea bargain with evil.' But experts believe Emwazi was helped to escape Britain by his terror associates who had been allowed back to London by the Government in 2011. Mohammed Emwazi, who was brought up in west London, was subject to a no fly order and was on a terror watch list but still managed to leave without detection . Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, pictured in  an ISIS video from September 14, 2014 (left) and at St Mary's Church of England primary school in London as a child . Experts say he is likely to have been aided with money, a false identity and bogus travel documents by a London jihadi cell which he had belonged to since 2009. Three members of the cell had been kicked out of London under Labour's control order regime, but were allowed to return in 2011 when Mrs May scrapped them. The power to relocate terror suspects was finally reintroduced a fortnight ago, under growing pressure from the security services. Speaking this afternoon, Mr Johnson slammed the 2011 'mistake' to scrap the 'internal exile' powers contained in Labour's control order regime. The Mayor of London said: 'We need to keep a very, very close eye on these people. 'The decision to modify the control orders, to water them down I think in retrospect looks as though it was a mistake because it is vital to be able, when you are controlling these people to be able to relocate them, to take them away from their support networks and look after them, to monitor them properly. The family home of Mohammed Emwazi, in Lancefield Street, West London . 'We are now back on the right track and it just confirms to me the vital importance of us being able to monitor these people, to keep tabs on them, to look at what they are saying to each other in their email, their electronic contact.' Mr Johnson added: 'The politicians who made that mistake need to think very carefully about why they did it and I think that the balance, the benefit of the doubt was, I am afraid, given too much to those who wish us serious harm. 'This whole thing needs to be tackled very, very robustly. 'We need to have a very strong security response that gives our people, gives our security services and the police the surveillance powers that they need.' The former head of Britain's terror powers watchdog David Anderson admitted Emwazi had 'a couple of associates… who were under control orders' before Mrs May scrapped them. He said he was not surprised that MI5 was aware of Emwazi but had failed to stop him from travelling overseas. 'I'm afraid it's not surprising to me at all. I do spend time with the intelligence agencies and with the police. They are very busy at the moment and they were very busy then. There are a lot of people that they're a bit suspicious of - there are hundreds, probably thousands.' He added: 'You can't round all those people up without a trial and declare that they're subject to some form of house arrest. You need at the very least to be sure that they have participated in terrorism before you start taking measures like that. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette cooper shadow today backed the London Mayor's attack on Mrs May. She said: 'We warned the Government from the start not to abolish control orders. I said in Parliament many times that those relocation powers were immensely important and that removing them would make it easier for terror suspects to organise.' The Labour shadow minister added: 'At the very least, the Prime Minister should ask the Intelligence and Security Committee to examine the period following the scrapping of relocation. 'Parliament needs to know whether the legislation to alter counter terror powers affected the UK's ability to prevent people travelling to Syria. 'The Home Secretary has a duty to protect national security, so if the decisions she made on legislation against expert advice have weakened national security instead, the public and Parliament have a right to know.' Jihadi John was named in High Court  as key player in UK terror funding network TWO YEARS before he vanished . Jihadi John was named in the High Court by the Home Secretary as being part of a terror funding network two years before he vanished from Britain despite being on a MI5 watchlist, it was revealed today. Court papers name Mohammed Emwazi as part of a notorious gang of Islamists called the London Boys 'provision of funds and equipment to Somalia to undertake terrorism-related activity'. This included allegedly raising cash to send people to terror training camos in Somalia. Emwazi was known to be trying to get to Somalia in 2009 and MI5 accused him of trying to join Al Shabaab. The London Boys were being monitored by the security services from as early as 2007, and Emwazi was himself interrogated by MI5 in 2009, but was still able to flee to Syria in 2012. Revealed: This court document from 2011 reveals that two years before he fled for Syria Mohammed Emwazi - Jihadi John -  was known by the Government and believed to be part of a terror gang called the London Boys . Emwazi's name is on paperwork relating to a control order for a terror suspect known as CE, among at least 13 others linked to Somalia and Al Shabaab including some of the world's most notorious terrorists. CE attended an Al Qaeda training camp led by Harun Fazul and Saleh Nabhan, a leading Al Qaeda figure suspected of involvement in the 1998 US embassy bombings in east Africa. Files leaked by WikiLeaks showed how Bin Laden sent messages to these men from his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, to other Al-Qaeda members in Somaliaand told them to carry out more attacks on the West. Fazul was named by Guantanamo Bay detainees as leader of Al Qaeda's African unit and trained number of Britons at a terror factory in Mogadishu. Saleh Nabhan was the mastermind behind two of East Africa's worst terror atrocities: the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 250, and the 2002 attempt to bring down an Israeli airline with Stinger missiles. He was known to be close to the White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite, who was the wife of 7/7 London terrorist bomber Germaine Lindsay. Notorious: Saleh Nabhan, left, and Harun Fazul, right, were also named in the document, and were part of Al Qaeda's leadership in Africa and received orders directly from Osama Bin Laden . The government stripped both Fazul and Nabhan of their British passports and they were killed in separate drone attacks in 2012. Also on the list was an extremist who can be identified only as J1 – an Ethiopian accused of being a member of Al Shabaab and a close associate of one of four bombers who attempted to cause mass casualties on the London Underground on July 21, 2005. On his return to Britain, Emwazi's comrade CE was tasked with recruiting others to join Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab. The group also included Hamza Chentouf and Mohammed Ezzouek, who along with CE were interrogated by British intelligence officers in Kenya. Ezzouek and Chentouf were rescued from Somalia . in 2007 after they were imprisoned while trying to flee after the US . ordered air strikes on Islamists who took over Mogadishu. The .

"The melting Arctic sea ice could open up new areas for fishing that run the danger of being completely unregulated, experts have warned. Yesterday it was revealed how in just 40 years the Arctic could be 'ice-free' as temperatures in polar regions rise faster than predicted. And this could open up the previously inaccessible offshore Arctic coast, giving fisherman access to whole new ecosystems - without any constraints in place. As Arctic sea ice melts, new regions will open up to fisherman (stock image shown). The House of Lords Arctic Committee said the UK must get involved. Within these regions, the populations of fish are unknown. This could lead to over-fishing if the practice goes unregulated . The latest warning came from the House of Lords Arctic Committee. They said that potentially uncontrolled fishing in the Arctic's international waters raised serious concerns about fish stocks in the region. They called for fishing in the central Arctic Ocean to be banned, until a recognised management regime could be agreed. The Arctic could be completely free of ice in just 40 years as a result of global warming, one of the world's leading climate change experts has warned. This would cause sea levels to rise to nearly unmanageable levels. Nobel Peace Prize winner Professor Oleg Anisimov, from the State Hydrological Institute in St Petersburg, said there is evidence that temperatures are rising four times faster in the frozen region than the rest of the planet. It should be noted that 'ice-free' does not mean it will be devoid of ice. Rather, an area (or grid) is said to be ice-free when it has lower than a 15 per cent ice concentration, enough for a ship to pass through. But the change would still be dramatic. He forecasts that the region will see temperature rises of up to 7°C within a century. 'For several reasons, the Arctic climate change is more intense and faster than in other regions. There is a reduction in snow and ice cover, which has a protective function,' he said. Predictions suggest that the Arctic will be soon be ice-free, although it should be noted this does not mean it will be devoid of ice. Rather, an area (or grid) is said to be ice-free when it has lower than a 15 per cent ice concentration, enough for a ship to pass through. The committee urged the UK to appoint an Ambassador for the Arctic - as France, Singapore and Japan have done - to ensure its influence there. Considering that much of the Arctic Ocean is inaccessible, the population of various species of fish in the region is unknown. As summer ice continues to fall, opening up the region, this raises the prospect of over-fishing becoming a problem, as if commercial fishing is allowed, the effect it is having will not be clear. 'The Arctic is changing in front of our eyes. That change is momentous and unprecedented,' said the committee's chairman, Lord Teverson. 'It will bring both difficulties and opportunities and it is vital that the UK takes this challenge seriously and is able to respond to it - indeed, is positioned as the premier partner for Arctic states and other interests in Arctic co-operation as that change happens. 'We also have serious concerns about the potential opening up of fishing in the central Arctic Ocean caused by a reduction in sea ice. 'We are calling for a ban on fishing there at least until more research is undertaken and we have a better understanding of the eco-systems that will be affected. 'We need to get a proper management regime in place for the central Arctic Ocean now, before the area is opened to the risk of over-fishing.' Yeseterday it was reported that the Arctic could be completely free of ice in just 40 years as a result of global warming, according to one of the world's leading climate change experts, Professor Oleg Anisimov. This map shows rates of erosion on the Arctic coast, with the fastest rates marked in red . The extent of Arctic sea ice has rapidly declined in the last few decades, as shown in this graph from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). This means more and more regions are likely to open up to ships as the Arctic becomes ice-free - running the risk of over-fishing . The UK has a long history of successfully engaging with the Arctic, as its 'closest neighbour', but the Government's approach is too hesitant and cautious in the face of other countries being assertive about their interests, a report by the committee said. And the peers warned that with Russia's foreign policy becoming increasingly hard to predict, efforts should be made to insulate the Arctic from other geopolitical tensions because of a 'global interest in protecting this unusually vulnerable environment'. The UK, the most northern country below the Arctic circle, should play an active role in managing fishing opportunities which are likely to open in previously inaccessible areas as sea ice retreats and fish stocks move north. Potentially uncontrolled fishing in the Arctic's international waters raises serious concerns about fish stocks in the region, the Lords warned, and called for a moratorium on fishing in the central Arctic Ocean until a recognised management regime could be agreed. Meanwhile, the recent fall in world energy prices may limit exploitation of the potentially vast oil and gas supplies in the Arctic in the short to medium term, offering a 'window of opportunity' to examine if extraction can be done safely and responsibly and under agreed international standards. The committee also concluded it was a matter of 'when', not 'if', the Arctic would be free of sea ice in summer. Warming in the Arctic raised the prospect of additional climate change caused by the release of methane gas from the seabed and melting permafrost, as well as other impacts such as altering the jet stream and bringing more extreme weather to the UK. The Lords called for increased funding for British Arctic science, and an examination of potential methane releases as part of a dedicated Arctic research programme.","As Arctic sea ice melts, new regions will open up to fisherman .

"A father who murdered his five kids before driving their bodies around for nine days and dumping them in a field had strangled four of the children and beat one to death, it has emerged. Timothy Ray Jones Jr., 33, was arrested in Mississippi on September 6 after a deputy said he smelled the stench of death in Jones' SUV at a traffic checkpoint. The father, from Red Bank, South Carolina, then led deputies to the bodies in rural Alabama. It emerged in grand jury indictments on Thursday that four of the children - Merah, eight, Elias, seven, Gabriel, two, and one-year-old Elaine - died 'by means of strangulation'. 'Killer': Timothy Ray Jones Jr., pictured being escorted from Smith County Jail in Mississippi last September, strangled four of his children and beat another one to death, according to newly-released indictments . Another of his children, six-year-old Nahtahn, was beaten to death, according to the indictments, which have been shared by The State for the first time. It is not clear what he used to murder the children, but five belts were found in the home, the newspaper noted. After the killings, he put their bodies in separate plastic bags and into his black 2006 Cadillac Escalade SUV before driving around for more than a week and dumping them. On September 6, he was stopped at a DUI checkpoint in Mississippi and officers noted that he was intoxicated and agitated. They found maggots, blood and children's clothes in his SUV, as well as handwritten notes about mutilating bodies, and the stench of bleach and death in the air, according to police reports. Murdered: One-year-old Elaine, left, and two-year-old Gabriel, right, were strangled to death last August . Loss: Seven-year-old Elias, left, and eight-year-old Merah, right, were also strangled before their bodies were put into bags in their father's SUV and driven for hundreds of miles before he dumped them in Alabama . Killed: Nahtahn, six, was allegedly beaten to death by his father, who feared the children would kill him, chop up his body and then feed it to dogs. Social workers said he was overwhelmed looking after the children . A check of Jones' license plate showed his ex-wife had reported him and the children missing three days earlier when he failed to bring them over for visitation. He led authorities to the five bodies on an Alabama hilltop near Pine Apple, 20 miles off Interstate 65 and about 65 miles south of Montgomery. Arrest: Timothy Jones, 33, could face the death penalty for allegedly murdering his five children . Jones told authorities that he murdered the children because he believed they 'were going to kill him, chop him up and feed him to the dogs', according to an arrest warrant. Last year, Jones' attorney said he had been treated for mental illness in the past and called for a mental evaluation to be performed on him as soon as possible. It emerged that he had earned a computer engineering degree and worked at a $71,000-a-year job. But nearly two years ago, he discovered his wife Amber was putting their children to bed then going to the neighbor's house and sleeping with their 19-year-old son, according to divorce papers. A therapist who saw Jones during their divorce described him as 'highly intelligent' and responsible, yet emotionally devastated and angry over his wife's actions. They divorced in October 2013 and Jones moved out with the children, but began to withdraw to the point where the woman who lived next door thought he and his family had moved away. Social services had visited the family three times to investigate conditions in the three years before the murders, and a recent report said Jones seemed 'overwhelmed' caring for the children. Scene: The father and his five children vanished from his Red Bank, South Carolina home last August . Found: After being stopped at a traffic checkpoint in Mississippi last September, officers noticed blood in his vehicle and the smell of bleach, and he led them to the bodies of his five children on this Alabama hilltop . He was reported missing with the children on September 3. Authorities said they believed the children had been killed shortly after they were last seen at school on August 28. Jones has been charged with five counts of murder and remains in jail. Prosecutors have not said if they will seek the death penalty, but Jones' attorneys have said it is likely, The State reported. In his teenage years, Jones went on a crime spree in Illinois. He was arrested on a cocaine possession charge March 30, 2001, in Carpentersville, Illinois. Six months later, when he was 19, he was arrested for stealing a car, burglary and passing forged checks.","Timothy Ray Jones Jr. was arrested last September after Mississippi deputies smelled death in his SUV during a DUI traffic stop .

"A northern Californian couple is praying for the safety of their family who are believed to have been captured by Islamic State militants in northern Syria. Sharlet David and her husband, Romel, of Modesto, California, fear that as many as 12 family members were  taken from their homes on Monday morning. 'They came at four in the morning. They attacked them and they took them away. They were asleep,' said Sharlet. Scroll down for video . Sharlet (left) and Romel David (right) at home in Modesto, California. The couple fear that Sharlet's brother and his son's family have been kidnapped by ISIS militants in northern Syria . Over 100 Assyrian Christian civilians were rounded up by ISIS as its fighters battled Kurdish and Christian militia for control of villages in the northern province of Hassakeh. Sharlet fears that her brother, his son, his son's wife, and their two small children were among those ripped from their beds that morning. 'What we heard is that it was a sea of black uniforms marching through all the villages, burning down the churches, desecrating the crosses and wreaking havoc,' Romel told KCRA. Sharlet's 59-year-old brother had been a car salesman in Modesto, but had returned to war-torn Syria two years ago in the hopes of returning to America with his  son and his family. They fear that those kidnapped by ISIS might suffer the same fate as the 21 Egyptian Christians beheaded on a beach in Libya earlier this month. The family identify as Assyrian Christians and fear the worst for their family members after the recent deaths of 21 Egyptian Christians in Libya . It is also possible that they could be used in a prisoner swap for captured ISIS militants. Some villagers were able to escape and one small group managed to contact a relative of Sharlet's, also in Modesto, and told her about the raid. They said that her brother and his son were taken into the mountains, while his daughter-in-law and grandchildren remained in the village under armed guard. The Davids did not want family members to be identified directly for fear of retribution. 'We pray,' Romel said. 'We pray all the time.' The Assyrian village of Abu Tina, recently captured by ISIS.

The number of Assyrian Christians abducted by the Islamic State in Syria has risen to 220 - far more than was previously feared, according to activists. Militants are said to have rounded up more hostages from a chain of villages along the strategic Khabur River in the past three days. After the first abductions on Monday, it was reported that 150 Assyrian Christians were seized after ISIS took control of two communities from Kurdish forces. Now the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that ISIS had picked up dozens more hostages from 11 communities near the town of Tal Tamr.","Sharlet and Romel David of Modesto, California, fear for 12 family members kidnapped by ISIS in northern Syria .

At Nusakambangan, a navy presence has been building around the island for the past week, with Indonesia's military commander Moeldoko saying they had to be ready for anything. The Bali Nine pair remain in Kerobokan jail awaiting the warden's signal that it's time to go to Nusakambangan after the move was postponed last week because the island was not ready. However Bali's chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso told the Daily Telegraph on Friday that Chan and Sukumaran will not be moved to the penal island Nusakambangan on Saturday but Sunday remains a possibility.

"A young seasonal ski worker was found dead today after being sucked into a snow clearing machine in the Pyrenees. The horrific discovery was made in the early morning in the French resort of Les Angles, which is currently packed with holidaymakers. Local mayor Michel Poudade said there was 'complete bafflement' as to what happened. 'The driver of the machine is in a terrible state, he is not coping well at all,' Mr Poudade added. The horrific accident happened in the early morning in the French resort of Les Angles (pictured), which is currently packed with holidaymakers . There was speculation that the woman, who was in her early 20s, may have been lying dead in the snow following an unrelated accident, or simply walked out of the driver's range of vision. A fleet of snow-clearing vehicles had been sent out to clear the roads of the ski resort in the early hours following heavy dumps. Nobody noticed the woman's body being sucked into the machine. The driver only made the macabre discovery when his plough's engine started to play up. He immediately called emergency services, but paramedics who arrived on the scene confirmed the woman was dead. The woman's identity or nationality has not been revealed, with local police saying 'everything is being done to contact her next of kin'. The seasonal ski worker, in her 20s, died after being sucked into a snow clearing machine in the Pyrenees (file picture) Heavy vehicles including snow clearing and snow making machines are common in modern ski resorts, but they can often cause extreme danger. In December, an inquest heard how a British university graduate died in the Austrian Alps when he crashed into a snow machine. Aleksander Owens-Thurston, 23, of Surrey, was killed in February 2014, just weeks after FI motor racing champion Michael Schumacher was placed into a medically-induced coma following a similar accident. Recording a verdict of accidental death, West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose urged further safety precautions. He said: 'This is a tragic matter. These snow making machines are increasingly used, and I suspect this year more than ever, as resorts try and have a full season and cannot afford to lose customers if there is not adequate amounts of snow. 'One finds snow making machines at many modern resorts across Europe. It seems to me that the marking of this snow making machine was probably inadequate. 'Witnesses referred to other resorts where they have bright, luminous tape and certainly a warning.I also note that the pedestal and the machine itself were padded but not the boom.'","The accident happened in the popular French ski resort of Les Angles .

"A Saudi man prosecutors portrayed as one of al-Qaeda's early leaders and Osama bin Laden's aide was convicted Thursday of conspiracy in the deadly 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Africa that killed a total of 224 people, including a dozen Americans. Khaled Al-Fawwaz, 52, stood expressionless, pursing his lips briefly, as the anonymous jury in Manhattan federal court delivered its verdict after more than two days of deliberating. He could face life in prison, though his lawyers said he planned to appeal. Prosecutors said al-Fawwaz, a native of Saudi Arabia, was a close confidant of bin Laden's and made sure the terror mastermind's death threats against Americans were heard and noticed worldwide in 1998. Guilty: FILE - Khaled Al-Fawwaz, 52, pictured in this January 20, 2015, file courtroom sketch,  was convicted Thursday of conspiracy in the deadly bombings of two US embassies in Africa . Mastermind: Prosecutors said al-Fawwaz (left) was a close confidant of Osama bin Laden (right) and one of the early leaders of al-Qaeda  back when the terrorist group was still in its infancy . 'From his onetime place at the top of al-Qaeda's membership list, Fawwaz now joins the long membership list of convicted, jailed terrorists,' US Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. With al-Fawwaz's conviction, 10 defendants tied to the embassy bombings have been convicted or pleaded guilty, Bharara said. Al-Fawwaz' lawyers said he was a peaceful dissident who had no part in al-Qaeda's violent plans. They saw the case as skewed by the passage of time and the drumbeat of news and fear about terrorism since the September 11 attacks. 'Trying a pre-9/11 terror case in a post-9/11 world, blocks from the World Trade Center, ensured that Mr. al-Fawwaz could never receive a truly fair trial,' defense lawyer Bobbi Sternheim said after the verdict. As one of bin Laden's 'original and most trusted lieutenants,' al-Fawwaz led an al-Qaeda Afghanistan training camp in the early 1990s, participated in a terrorist cell in Kenya and set up a media information office in London where he became bin Laden's link to Western journalists, Bharara said. Al-Fawwaz disseminated bin Laden's 1998 order to followers to kill Americans, a directive that was followed by the August 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, Bharara said. The attacks killed 224 people, including a dozen Americans. A bomb set off at the US embassy in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, killed 10 people and injured 72 others on August 7, 1998. This image shows then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright touring the blast site . Devastation: This August 1998 file picture shows Kenyan residents looking at the US embassy days after the bomb blast that killed 213 people . Al-Fawwaz disseminated bin Laden's 1998 order to followers to kill Americans, which prosecutors said led to the twin attacks in Africa . 'Murderous words lead to murderous action,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told jurors during the trial. An al-Qaeda roster of original members lists bin Laden first and al-Fawwaz ninth, and 18 copies of bin Laden's 1996 declaration of war — signed by bin Laden — were found in al-Fawwaz's London apartment, prosecutors said. The roster was found in an al-Qaeda leader's home after 9/11, the government said. Defense lawyers said al-Fawwaz sought only peaceful reform in his homeland. While he associated with bin Laden and some other al-Qaeda members early on, al-Fawwaz was dismayed by bin Laden's shift toward violence and wasn't aware of any plots for bloodshed, Sternheim said. 'We emphatically dispute that Khaled al-Fawwaz joined any violent conspiracy' against American citizens or property, she said. The month-long trial unfolded in a heavily fortified courthouse where federal guards stood outside with machine guns and spectators had to pass through a special metal detector outside the courtroom. Jurors got a picture of al-Qaeda in its infancy, when its members numbered in the hundreds and it plotted terrorist attacks that eventually drew the attention of criminal investigators a world away. Al-Fawwaz (second left) was arrested in London in 1998 and extradited from Great Britain to face trial in the US for the bombings in 2012 . Witnesses included an American former al-Qaeda member who said bin Laden asked him in 1995 to kill Egypt's president by ramming the president's plane with bin Laden's in midair. The New York Police Department's counterterrorism and intelligence chief, John Miller, testified about meeting al-Fawwaz in London in 1998, when Miller was a TV news correspondent. Al-Fawwaz did not testify. Arrested in London in 1998, he was extradited from Great Britain to face trial in the US for the bombings in 2012. Al-Fawwaz had been scheduled to stand trial with a co-defendant, Abu Anas al-Libi, but he died last month after a long illness.","Khaled Al-Fawwaz, 52, could face life in prison in connection to the bombings that killed a dozen Americans in 1998 .

"The 5:2 diet claims to not only help people lose weight, but also guard against diseases including cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's. Created by scientist Michael Mosley, it involves women reducing their calorie intake to 500 for two days a week, and men to 600 calories. The rest of the time, they can eat normally. Now a new study argues that the health benefits of 5:2 also exist when someone sticks to a 'feast and famine' diet, eating far more than they would one day and fasting another. The 5:2 diet claims to not only help people lose weight, but also guard against diseases including cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's. Created by scientist Michael Mosley, it involves women reducing their calorie intake to 500 for two days a week, and men to 600 calories. The rest of the time, they can eat normally . Intermittent fasting is an umbrella term for various diets that cycle between a period of fasting and eating normally. Perhaps the most famous is the 5:2 diet which involves women reducing their calorie intake to 500 for two days a week, and men to 600 calories. The rest of the time, they can eat normally. Previous animal studies suggest that intermittent fasting can guard against  diseases including cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's. Scientists believe it provides these benefits by allowing the body to respond better to stress that might otherwise damage it. For instance, fasting could reduce inflammation, or improve the removal of damaged molecules, as well as starve tumors, according to previous research. But the health benefits of the diet only appear if people don't increase their intake of antioxidants, which can be found in high doses in superfoods such as chokeberries, as well as vitamin C and vitamin E supplements. During a three-week period, 24 participants alternated one day of eating 25 per cent of their daily caloric intake with one day of eating 175 per cent of their daily caloric intake. The study by the University of Florida measured the participants' changes in weight, blood pressure, heart rate and glucose levels over 10 weeks. They also looked at cholesterol, markers of inflammation and genes involved in protective cell responses. 'We found that intermittent fasting caused a slight increase to SIRT 3, a well-known gene that promotes longevity and is involved in protective cell responses,' said Michael Guo, a co-author at Harvard Medical School. The SIRT3 gene encodes a protein also called SIRT3. The protein SIRT3 belongs to a class of proteins called sirtuins which, if increased in mice, can extend their lifespans. Researchers think proteins such as SIRT3 are activated by oxidative stress, which is triggered when there are more free radicals produced in the body than it can neutralise with antioxidants. However, small levels of free radicals can be beneficial: When the body undergoes stress - which happens during fasting - small levels of oxidative stress can trigger protective pathways, Guo said. 'The hypothesis is that if the body is intermittently exposed to low levels of oxidative stress, it can build a better response to it,' Wegman said. The researchers found that the intermittent fasting decreased insulin levels in the participants, which means the diet could have an anti-diabetic effect as well. To test antioxidant supplements, the participants repeated the diet but also included vitamin C and vitamin E. At the end of the three weeks, the researchers tested the same health parameters. They found that the beneficial sirtuin proteins such as SIRT 3 and another, SIRT1, tended to increase as a result of the diet. However, when antioxidants were supplemented on top of the diet, some of these increases disappeared. A new study argues that the health benefits of 5:2 also exist when someone sticks to a 'feast and famine' diet, eating far more than they would one day and fasting another. But only if people don't increase their intake of antioxidants, which can be found in high doses in superfoods such as chokeberries (pictured) This is in line with some research that indicates flooding the system with antioxidants may counteract the effects of fasting or exercise, said Dr Christiaan Leeuwenburgh who was involved in the research. 'You need some pain, some inflammation, some oxidative stress for some regeneration or repair,' Dr Leeuwenburgh said. 'These young investigators were intrigued by the question of whether some antioxidants could blunt the healthy effects of normal fasting.' On the study participants' fasting days, they ate foods such as roast beef and gravy, mashed potatoes, Oreo cookies and orange sherbet - but they ate only one meal. On the feasting days, the participants ate bagels with cream cheese, oatmeal sweetened with honey and raisins, turkey sandwiches, apple sauce, spaghetti with chicken, yogurt and soda - and lemon pound cake, Snickers bars and vanilla ice cream. 'Most of the participants found that fasting was easier than the feasting day, which was a little bit surprising to me,' Dr Guo said. 'On the feasting days, we had some trouble giving them enough calories.' Dr Leeuwenburgh said future studies should examine a larger group of participants and should include studying a larger number of genes in the participants as well as examining muscle and fat tissue.","Fasting is thought to prevent diseases including cancer and diabetes .

In addition, over a series of coffees and walks around Geneva, Torres, a charming and good-humored but rather shy young man of 30, slowly provided additional insights into his time in captivity - his first interview with a non-French journalist.Scroll down for video . Released French hostage Pierre Torres (far right) arrives back in France with fellow journalists Edouard Elias (far left), Didier Francois (second from left) and Nicolas Henin (second from left) after being released after 10 months of captivity in Syria . He was part of a group of hostages who passed their time by playing chess on card ripped from discarded milk cartons . French President François Hollande greets Pierre on his arrival back in France from Syria . 'We were moved around a lot, kept underground most of the time, sometimes chained together for weeks on end,' said Pierre. 'It was tough and terrible things happened, but we also kept ourselves in as good spirits as possible. 'We passed the time by inventing quizzes which we played with each other. We also played chess. We created chess pieces out of a discarded milk carton we had. 'Our captors let us play but were angered when we represented some of the pieces by faces - their interpretation of Islam strictly forbids any depictions of any man or animal. So we had to make the pieces again.' Torres, speaking in English, said that during his 10 months of captivity he learned English from the British and American hostages he was held with: British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines, freelance journalist John Cantlie, American journalists Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig. Cantlie remains in captivity. The others have been killed. 'We were not given access to TV, computers or the internet - but they did sometimes give us books, but mainly books propagating Islamic thought. They also brought us videos to watch, videos that tried to persuade us that the caliphate was god's will.' Torres added that he and fellow French hostage Nicolas Henin used the time in captivity to write a children's story in their head, and that book, titled Papa Hérisson rentrera-t-il à la maison? - Will Daddy Hedgehog come back home? - will be published in France next month. Torres did the illustrations for the book, which I suppose also served as a kind of therapy for him. He is a very gifted illustrator and drew me a beautiful full-page picture, which he said represented all the human rights activists at the Geneva Summit, on the copy of the book he gave me. He speaks fondly of his fellow hostages. Pierre was imprisoned with British hostages Alan Henning (left) and David Haines (right) for months while they were held by ISIS . He shared captivity with U.S aid worker Peter Kassig (left) and journalist Steven Sotloff (right), both of whom were beheaded . Freelance journalist James Foley (left) was described as 'very sociable' by Pierre. British photographer John Cantlie (right) - who was abducted in November 2012 - is still being held in Syria . 'Stephen Sotloff was very clever, and had deep political knowledge. And he was very brave. He was not afraid of to answer back to our captors. He used to challenge them with what he saw as inconsistencies in their teaching and worldview. He also, I should add, won all the games of chess. 'He managed to conceal the fact from everyone that he was Jewish and had lived in Israel. None of us had any idea and I only found out from press reports after he was killed.' ISIS supporters tend to be extremely anti-Semitic and had they known Sotloff was Jewish, he would probably have been subject to additional torture. Torres also confirmed what fellow hostage Nicolas Henin already told the French media, that Mehdi Nemmouche - the French Islamist on trial in Belgium for the murder of four Jews at the Brussels Jewish museum last year - was the same man who had been one of his captors in Syria. Henin has added that Nemmouche was responsible for torturing them too. Torres doesn't want to go into detail about the mistreatment the ISIS prisoners received and prefers to concentrate on the more agreeable details, to make sure they are not only remembered as victims of what are in effect perhaps the most sadistic snuff videos ever posted on the Internet. The French hostage was held by Jihadi John's terror gang. In January, the group demanded ransom payments for Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa, from Japan . London man Mohammed Emwazi (pictured as a primary school pupil) was yesterday revealed to be the world's most wanted man, Jihadi John . But he did confirm to me that 'at least 10 French and Belgium citizens' were among their captors. He also hinted that the British and American prisoners were 'supervised' by a group of British and other fluent English-speaking ISIS members. 'Alan Henning was in many ways the most simple and innocent guy you can imagine. Being a taxi driver he was more down-to-earth, not like the experienced travellers that some of the journalists being held hostages were. 'He had a huge heart. It was sometimes hard to understand his heavy Manchester accent. But his jokes and humour came through. 'It's cool to be with him,' one of the other European hostages said to me at the time. Even though we were being moved around in locations in the middle of the desert he liked to speak of his beloved hobby of fishing. He was crazy about it. I think he taught me every word connected with fishing in the English vocabulary. 'David Haines was more introvert. He thought very carefully before he said anything. Peter Kassig had been disappointed by some of the things he had seen when he served in the American army and so much wanted to help Syrians. 'Jim Foley was very sociable. If the European hostages had arguments, he used to calm us all down. In a way he was the most respected of us all. He had a big soul.' Torres also spent time with American aid worker Kayla Mueller, who ISIS says was accidentally killed last month in a Jordanian airstrike, but said that most of the time, as a woman, she was kept separate from the men. ISIS fighters parade through Raqqa, where the terror network film many propaganda videos . Together with the three other French hostages, Torres was released last summer, for a reported ransom of several million euros - though the French government has denied they had anything to do with this. 'We were given 24 hours notice before we were freed. This gave time for the other hostages to give me messages to pass to their families. We were not allowed to take any paper with us but I memorised the email and phone numbers of their relatives.' Torres has subsequently had phone and Skype conversations with the relatives of some of the hostages and Jim Foley's mother flew from the U.S to Paris to meet with him. Torres also indicates that terrible things were done to them, and sometimes there were sharp disagreements between the hostages, but out of respect for those who were beheaded and for the sake of their families, he says he will never make public some of the disagreements or sufferings. 'It would be the decision of the families if they one day want to reveal details of the messages I passed on to them or what was done to them in captivity.' Torres is also wary of saying anything publically that could make life harder for John Cantlie, who remains an ISIS prisoner and who is now being used by ISIS to film a series of propaganda reports from the de facto capital of the Islamic State, Raqqa. Torres now speaks a relatively fluent English – a language he barely understood before his captivity. 'I learned English from the British and American hostages. Even though there were 23 of us in total from several different countries, English was the main language we all spoke together.' ISIS yesterday executed four men they accused of being spies in the Salahuddin province of Iraq . For various security reasons, few details have been made public about other released hostages from Spain, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and elsewhere. The other European hostages were all released, apart from a Russian who was executed by ISIS at the time Torres was being held there. 'It is not for me to judge whether the U.S and British governments should have paid a ransom for their hostages. I would only say that the U.S is spending a lot more money on outside intelligence than any European government and they did not do the job to get their hostages out. 'More should have been done, although it is not for me to say how.' Torres also wanted to point out that he spent time with the locals in Raqqa in the immediate period before his abduction and 'the population of Raqqa was not at all supportive of ISIS and there were many demonstrations against ISIS there.' He was concerned that the people of Raqqa now have to live not only under the terror of ISIS rule but under the fear of American and allied airstrikes. 'It is them I am also thinking of,' he says.","Pierre Torres was held captive in Syria for ten months by ISIS militants .

"Soprano Sarah Brightman, pictured, will blast off for space on September 1 aboard the Soyuz-FG rocket to the International Space Station . Just before 11am on September 1, a mighty Soyuz‑FG rocket will blast off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome deep in the desert steppes of Kazakhstan. On board will be a space capsule containing three highly-trained cosmonauts bound for the International Space Station (ISS). The crew will be commanded by Colonel Sergei Volkov, a 42-year-old Russian who will be leading his third mission into space. Assisting him will be 35-year-old Danish Flight Engineer Andreas Mogensen, the holder of a doctorate in engineering from the University of Texas. The third crew member will be a 55-year-old English soprano called Sarah Brightman. Hang on a minute. Sarah Brightman? The big‑haired Phantom Of The Opera star who was once married to Andrew Lloyd Webber? Yes, that very same Sarah Brightman will be boldly going where no multi-millionaire singer has been before. Brightman, who ironically once fronted Hot Gossip for their 1978 smash hit I Lost My Heart To A Starship Trooper, is becoming a cosmonaut. It seems like a joke. But the star, who has sold more than 30 million albums, is deadly serious. Recently, she was shivering in sub-zero temperatures in a forest outside Moscow during survival training with her fellow cosmonauts. This week, Brightman announced that she’ll hold a press conference on March 10 to discuss the mission. It turns out the singer has always hankered after being the Brightman on the moon. ‘I think I was eight at the time. I remember watching the first man on the moon on TV, and something flipped,’ she said in an interview. ‘I’d been quiet and reticent as a child, and suddenly my mind opened and I thought: “I want to do something very, very special. I want to go there, where they are; I want to go up into space.” That moment, things changed for me.’ Ms Brightman, right, was previously married to renowned composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, left . The singer’s fascination with space travel may seem surprising — in fact, a cynic might suggest that the whole thing is just a publicity stunt. But if that’s the case, then it’s a stunt that is financially truly astronomical. The most reliable estimate suggests that Brightman’s ten-day sojourn on the ISS will cost her £34 million. Brightman may be rich — but not that rich, surely? Space tourists tend to be billionaires, not mere multi-millionaires. Ms Brightman, pictured, fronted Hot Gossip's 1978 smash hit I Lost My Heart To A Starship Trooper . Besides the question of who is funding the trip, what sort of training does a middle-aged woman have to do to be taken around the world 16 times a day? After all, in order to fly into space, you need to be a lot fitter than your average Ryanair passenger. That’s why, back in July 2012, Sarah travelled from her home near Los Angeles to Houston, where Nasa subjected the singer to the most rigorous medical checks to see whether she could make it as a cosmonaut. Turns out she could. ‘The doctor, who has worked with a lot of astronauts, was saying: “I don’t believe this: even on the brain scans you’re coming out perfect,” ’ Brightman said. The singer’s next port-of-call was the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Star City, near Moscow, where she was evaluated on a whole range of simulators. Perhaps the most gruelling was the centrifuge — a giant arm-like structure that whisks its poor occupants around at something approaching 200mph, simulating the massive g‑forces that astronauts are subjected to when they sit on top of a rocket hurtling into space. Apparently, Brightman remained calm, with her pulse barely increasing. Other tests included being strapped to rotating chairs, and a psychological evaluation. ‘It was full-on,’ she said. ‘It was far more than I could’ve expected. ‘But I’d already sort of been trained for it by all my years of touring, in terms of the uncomfortableness, not knowing what to expect, having to create something out of nothing.’ Brightman may well have been prepared by the man she has most recently been romantically linked to, a flaxen-haired Californian inventor and aeronautics engineer called Dezso Molnar. According to Molnar’s website, he worked at Truax Engineering, one of the first companies that attempted to commercialise private manned space travel, and is currently developing a flying motorbike. With or without his help, Brightman passed through Star City with flying colours. Over the next six months, she can expect training to get even tougher. It will include working in space suits underwater, experiencing weightlessness in specially adapted aircraft, working on her physical and mental fitness, learning some Russian and getting to know her way around a mock-up of the ISS. The regime would be gruelling even for someone half her age. However, we must return to that thorny question of who is paying for all this. One clue could be found at the press conference in Moscow in October 2012 when Brightman announced her stellar ambitions. Ms Brightman will board the Soyuz-FG rocket as it blasts off into space to join the International Space Station . Sitting alongside her was a man called Neil Ford, who is the director of the sector for external relations and public information of UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation). As it happens, Brightman is a UNESCO ‘Artist for Peace’, which means she is an international advocate for its work. Ford and Brightman gushed about how the trip into space would ‘reach out to be a force for good’, promote ‘sustainability’ and encourage more women to enter the fields of science and technology. Brazenly referencing Dream Chaser, the album she would release in 2013, Brightman gushed: ‘We want to engage a generation of dream chasers from all walks of life to help us create a more sustainable future.’ Such sentiments are very worthy but they’re rather woolly. It is unclear how Brightman’s chasing of her own dream will, in reality, improve the planet and the advancement of women. Ms Brightman, pictured, is a UNESCO 'Artist for Peace' although they are not paying for her trip . However, according to a spokesman, UNESCO is not forking out a bean for Brightman’s mission. Nevertheless, its backing naturally makes the singer’s reach for the stars look more humanitarian than purely egotistical. If UNESCO is providing credibility, then another body is backing the aspirant astronaut in rather more practical ways. In Beijing in July 2013, Brightman signed a deal with the Reignwood Group. Reignwood is a vast Chinese collective firm that — among other activities — develops property, distributes the soft drink Red Bull, owns resorts, runs health centres, has its own aviation firm and has even recently bought Wentworth Golf Club for £135 million. Also in its portfolio in the UK is 10 Trinity Square in the City of London — now a luxury hotel, club and apartment block. At the ceremony, Brightman agreed — for an undisclosed fee — to be the ‘image ambassador’ for Trinity Square, and would ‘attend cultural exchanges organised by Reignwood’ every year for the next four years. She also agreed to perform a concert during her time in the space station that would be streamed live back to Earth ‘during an event organised by Reignwood’. It is undoubtedly a great coup for the Group. Brightman is a huge star in Asia, and her perceived sophistication is a big draw for the type of clientele that Reignwood wants to woo. A concert from space given by Brightman will be a fantastic publicity stunt for Reignwood, and would help to cement its global brand. The Group is worth many billions, so it is conceivable that Reignwood can bankroll most, if not all, of Brightman’s space trip. Sarah might have secured what may be the ultimate freebie. She may once have lost her heart to a starship trooper, but in order to get her to the heavens, it’s now been won by an Asian conglomerate. Ultimately, to get into space, it’s not dreams that Brightman has had to chase, but the reality of cold, hard Chinese cash.","Sarah Brightman will board the Soyuz space rocket on September 1 .

"A police force has scrapped an anti-violence online poster after Twitter users said it showed an officer with a riot stick hitting a victim begging for mercy. The image was supposed to promote a campaign to stop drunk and violent people entering pubs and clubs. But Twitter users quickly pointed out that the logo looked more like police brutality - claiming it appeared to show a riot officer beating a prone victim. Ridiculed: Devon and Cornwall Police were mocked on Twitter for this online campaign poster - which appeared to depict an officer with a riot stick hitting a victim begging for mercy . Paul Cruikshank tweeted '@DC-Police @euanmccolm How many drunk people the Dept's arrested have had a helmet on and carrying a truncheon?'. Police replied that it was 'meant to show one drunk person attacking another, which often happens when drinkers go overboard'. But this met with a response from Phil Ellery, who tweeted '@DC-Police a drunk person wearing a riot helmet and carrying a truncheon?'. Amazingly, the image can be downloaded from a number of clip-art websites, including pubzi and clker, by searching for the term 'police brutality'. A Devon and Cornwall spokesman today told MailOnline: 'The breathalyser campaign in Torquay has been extremely successful in contributing to reducing crime in and around the town centre. Violent crime was reduced by 45 per cent in January compared to last year. 'The image used on the infographic posted on social media to celebrate the success of the initiative was intended to depict a violent incident between two drunk members of the public. Online results: The same image can be found on this clip-art website by searching for 'police brutality' Another clip-art website, called clker.com, has the same image stored, again with the title 'police brutality' On this website, openclipart, the controversial image is searchable under a number of terms including 'violence', 'brutality', 'demonstration' and 'police' 'It has since been made clear that the picture could be seen as showing a police officer hitting somebody. This was not our intention. 'We apologise for any offence and it has now been removed. We hope that this does not detract from the great campaign we have run with our partners and the licensing trade in Torquay. The picture, posted yesterday, was accompanied by the message 'Breathalyser scheme #RU2drunk... keeping you safe'. Police want potentially drunk people to be breathalysed before they are allowed into pubs and clubs where they could spark violence. The spokesman added 'The breathalyser campaign in Torquay has been extremely successful in reducing crime in and around the town centre.

"A man shot four relatives and three neighbors before turning the gun on himself after finding his mother dead on the couch, police claim. Joseph Aldridge, 36, allegedly opened fire in four separate locations on Thursday night after his 74-year-old mother Alice, who had been ill, died  at home in Texas County, Missouri. Armed with a handgun, he shot two male cousins, their wives, and three neighbors before shooting himself in his pickup truck on the outskirts of Summersville, Missouri, a neighbor told Daily Mail Online. An initial investigation suggests Aldridge had been feuding with his cousins for years. Authorities identified four of the victims as Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48. The shooter was a cousin to the male victims. Scroll down for video . Joseph Aldridge, 36, was found dead in his pickup truck in the middle of the highway after shooting seven people dead in rural Missouri . The shooter (pictured) is suspected of killing Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48 . Nine people died in a string of shootings in southern Missouri on Thursday night and Friday morning at six different scenes (pictured) Local media identified the other three victims as Darrell Shriver and Shriver's son and daughter-in-law, Carey and Valerie Shriver. Shriver's wife Martha was wounded and hospitalized with serious but stable injuries. His grandson had hidden in another room and is staying with relatives while his mother is treated. A neighbor told Daily Mail Online that everyone in the small towns of Tyrone and Summersville are aware of each other, and that 'he probably killed 10 per cent of the town's population last night'. Joseph Aldridge, who used one handgun in the attacks, is believed to be the cousin of some of the victims. All victims lived within a three mile radius of each other. Alice L. Aldridge, 74, the suspect's mother, 'died of natural causes' on the couch and is thought to have been dead for more than 24 hours before being found Thursday night. The woman died of a heart attack, the Summersville man said. Police discovered her while looking for her son. Her death may have sparked the suspect to go on his rampage, Texas County Coroner Tom Whittaker told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Joseph Aldridge has a minor criminal history, according to the local sheriff. Three other victims, from a different family, have not yet been identified. Police first heard of the incident when a young girl called about gunshots at 10:15pm on Thursday evening . The shootings occurred within three miles of each other near Tyrone, a small town in Texas County, Missouri. Some of the victims were Joseph Aldridge's cousins . Sheriff James Sigman (pictured) identified four victims and a woman who died of natural causes as related to Aldridge, but did not identify three victims . The Summersville resident said that there had been an ongoing feud between the suspected shooter's family and some of the victims. John Shriver, 72, of Tyrone, said that he was called by a relative to check on her son. After arriving at the son's house he found him and his wife dead in their bedroom. The couple's son was hidden safely in the closet. A frightened girl called the police around 10.15pm on Thursday after hearing gunshots and fleeing to a neighbor's house. Two bodies were later found in the girl's home. The barefoot girl was crying that her parents had been shot and was only wearing a nightgown, the neighbor told the Associated Press. Her legs had been cut up after running through a field full of thickets. Five more bodies were found in three additional residences, according to Missouri State Highway Patrol. One woman, believed to be Martha Shriver, was injured with a gunshot wound and is in the hospital. She is expected to survive. Joseph Aldridge died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his GMC pickup, which was in the middle of highway WW. He did not leave a note. Troopers began an investigation in the area following the shootings. A resident reported that authorities were knocking on doors at 3.45am on Friday. The state-wide Missouri State Highway Patrol is assisting the small town in the investigation. Authorities did not release a suspected motive for the killings and are not looking for any other suspects. 'This is a bucolic area, one of the reasons people move here is to avoid these kind of incidents' the superintendent of nearby Houston's school district said . A teenage girl alerted police to the shootings when she ran through a snowy field with thickets barefoot, with nothing on but her nightgown . Staff of the Houston's school district were told to arrive early for counseling, according to the Houston Herald. Superintendent Scott Dill said that residents of the close-knit community are in a 'state of shock' and he has been trying to help kids come to grips with the situation. 'This is a bucolic area, one of the reasons people move here is to avoid these kind of incidents,' he told Daily Mail Online. Texas County, Missouri is an Ozark region of about 25,000 people located east of college town Springfield and south of Army base Fort Leonard Wood. Tyrone is located in the southern portion of the county, south of Houston, the county seat, which has about 2,000 residents. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said that the shootings were 'a horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to the victims of these senseless acts and their families.' Department of Mental Health in the state have also made contact with local authorities to provide crisis intervention services and counseling. Autopsies will be performed over the weekend. Mr Whittaker said that the county averages about one homicide a year, many years having none. Texas County, which has a population of about 25,000, is described as a 'close knit' community.

"The head gamekeeper at Belvoir Castle David Boynton (pictured) has been banned from the road for drink driving . The head gamekeeper at Belvoir Castle has been banned from the road for drink driving - after he had an afternoon 'tipple' with the Duchess of Rutland. David Boynton, 76, got behind the wheel of his Mitsubishi after he was invited to join the Duchess, Emma Rutland, for a sherry to celebrate his recent marriage. The court heard Boynton felt obliged to accept but tried to get rid of most of it without the Duchess noticing by pouring it into a nearby plant pot. Boynton was then stopped by police after he was seen driving erratically near his home on the 16,000-acre estate. Officers found the tipple had pushed him just over the limit- with  82 milligrammes of alcohol in 100ml of blood - the legal limit is 80 milligrammes. On Monday Boynton, who has been head gamekeeper at Belvoir Castle for three years, admitted to drink driving when he appeared at Grantham Magistrate's Court. He was handed a 12-month driving ban which would be reduced to nine if he completes a drink driver's rehabilitation course. He was fined £230, ordered to pay £85 court costs and a £23 victim surcharge. Prosecutor Marie Stace said: 'Police stopped the Mitsubishi Mr Boynton was driving on Eastwell Road in Belvoir. 'The officers could smell alcohol and after Boynton failed a roadside breath test he was arrested and taken to the police station, where a blood test was taken.' The Duchess, Emma Rutland, 53, provided a character reference for the defendant in a letter read by magistrates. They also heard that Boynton lives on the estate in Knipton, Leicestershire. Sonia Bhalla, defending, said Boyton had joined the Duchess of Rutland for a sherry at around 4pm on December 8 last year. Ms Bhalla, defending, said: 'Mr Boynton had been Belvoir Castle's head gamekeeper for the last three years, and on the date in question he had been to see his employer the Duchess of Rutland and she had offered him a tipple. Boynton had got behind the wheel of his Mitsubishi after he joined the Duchess of Rutland (pictured) for a sherry to celebrate his recent marriage . 'He felt obliged to accept, although recognised that he wasn't under duress. He did try to tip the alcohol into a nearby plant pot. He then left the castle and drove into the open arms of the law. 'Mr Boynton is an absolutely lovely individual, and it was his first ever brush with the law. I can tell you that this is an absolutely lovely individual. 'He has worked from the age of seven, and is still in full-time employment. He has been head gamekeeper at Belvoir Castle for the last three seasons..' Magistrates said that it was one of the lowest blood readings they had ever seen. Earlier this month a neighbour living next to the Duke of Rutland's daughters in London complained about the siblings raucous late-night parties. Boynton claimed he had tried to pour some of the afternoon sherry into a nearby plant pot at Belvoir Castle (pictured) without the Duchess noticing, but he still drank enough to tip him over the legal alcohol limit . Jackie Elliott wrote to the Duke, David Manners, who is worth around £125 million, claiming that it was like 'living next door to a nightclub..' The Duke's daughters, Lady Violet Manners, 21, and sisters Lady Alice, 19, and Lady Eliza, 17, live in a £2.6million mansion on Bovington Road, Fulham. David Boynton today refused to comment on his driving ban. Speaking from his farm house on the sprawling Belvoir Castle estate, he said: 'No comment. You can get off this land.' A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess of Rutland said: 'The comment will be no comment.' The Duke and Duchess of Rutland at  home . Twenty years ago, the duchess was plain Emma Watkins, a farmer’s daughter from Radnorshire in the Welsh borders. But in 1992, Emma married David- the Duke of Rutland, whose ancestral home, Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire had been in the family since 1509. The Duke and Duchess of Rutland, went onto have five children – Violet, Alice, Eliza, Charles and Hugo. More than a decade ago, when Emma’s father-in-law Charles died, her husband David found himself 11th Duke of Rutland and the 36th generation of his family to inherit the castle and its estate. At the time, the castle was in crisis facing dwindling visitor numbers, death duties of almost £10 million and repair costs of up to an eye-watering £6.5 million. Thanks to the Duke and Duchess, today, Belvoir is the setting for national events such as the CLA Game Fair, rock concerts, weddings,product launches, TV shows and feature films. Eagle-eyed cinema-goersmay have spotted the castle in various guises in Hollywood movies suchas The Da Vinci Code and The Young Victoria. But while the estate was doing well, the Rutlands' marriage  was crumbling. In 2012, the Duchess finally announced she was separating from the Duke of Rutland after a number of infidelities by her husband. Despite the end of their marriage, the couple have remained living in the colossal gothic castle, living separate lives in different wings.","David Boynton got behind the wheel after joining the Duchess for a sherry .

At a probable cause hearing held on Friday, prosecutors said the little boy suffered 'multiple stab wounds to the torso, contusions to the head from blunt force trauma and his genitals were partially mutilated,' KHOU reported. Mungia did not appear in court. A FedEx driver passing the house around 1pm saw the assault and immediately called 911. 'I thought she was giving him CPR,' the driver told Click 2 Houston. 'But then she started slamming his head on the edge of the concrete driveway.' Police say Mungia was still attacking the boy when they arrived at the scene. They struggled to get Mungia off of him, the driver said. One cop eventually had to kick her off of the child. Police tackled Mungia and arrested her. A deputy told Click 2 Houston that the 23-year-old was naked from the waist up when the police arrived. Officers found blood inside the house and on the driveway where a bloody shirt lay on the pavement.

The boy was airlifted to Memorial Hermann Hospital where he was listed in critical condition and immediately taken in to surgery. Mungia was taken in for questioning and a mental health evaluation after the incident. She is being held at Harris County Jail without bail, charged with injury to a child with serious bodily injury. The 23-year-old lived with her son, her parents, and her younger sister in the two-story home. Family friends, shocked by the incident, described Mungia as a 'good mom,' the Houston Chronicle reports. However, a longtime friend of the family said Mungia struggled with post-partum psychosis since her son's birth but thought that Mungia had been treated and everything was under control. Neighbors stood shocked as the boy was loaded aboard the chopper in the otherwise peaceful town. One mother even pulled her one-year-old son close to her as she watched.

"A remarkable photography exhibition has revealed 300,000 images of every object an artist has touched with his right hand for the past 12 years. Italian Alberto Frigo's series 'Images of the artifacts used by the main right hand' comprehensively documents the thousands of everyday objects he has used for more than a decade. Photos included in the Lifelogging exhibition show hairbrushes, toothbrushes, drinks, food, reading glasses and more. Alberto Frigo's exhibition comprises thousands of small photographs displayed on separate panels . Mr Frigo is pictured as he takes a photo while using a hand tool during home renovations . Other everyday objects used include drink bottles (left) and an electric shaver (right) Many of the photographs show him simply eating - here he is pictured left holding a spoon. Right, he photographs himself holding a kaleidoscope . Two other images show him washing his hair in the shower (left) and then later brushing it . The 35-year-old Sweden-based artist used a small digital camera to record all objects he came into contact with in what he calls a 'DNA code for other humans to interpret'. He explained: 'The panels show the objects I have used with my right hand since the 24th of September 2003. 'Each panel represents a month, each line a day, and each individual photograph an object. 'Each of these objects is like the letter of an alphabet representing my activities as a kind of DNA code for other humans to interpret.' He estimated he touches about 75 objects per day, and intends to continue the project until his retirement in 2040, Yahoo reported. Alberto Frigo previously attempted to use a finger-mounted camera system where the camera sat permanently attached to his hand (pictured) Mr Frigo estimates he touches 75 objects a day with his right hand. Here he is pictured left and right drinking . Thousands of photographs simply document food or the utensils he uses to eat . Mr Frigo's exhibition is composed of many panels displaying the photograph in strands which he calls a type of 'DNA' It was when he started studying in Vancouver and became 'fascinated' by all that he was learning - such as making his own food, his laundry and the other jobs his mother once took care of - that the project began. He said: 'It was about at this time that I tried to figure out a way to record my life without all the post editing and technological frustrations. ‘A day later I was photographing every object my right hand uses in order to keep track of my activities. ‘I then thought of the objects I was using as the letters of an alphabet which could, in the long run, make up a sort of DNA code of my life. I was 24 then and still eager to discover new exciting things in life.’ He has become so accustomed to the project that his left hand now almost naturally photographs his right hand without him even thinking about it, and he abides by the rule that every object the dominant hand uses is photographed once while being used. His exhibition is currently on display at the Science Gallery in Dublin. Mr Frigo photographs himself as his right hand touches his reading glasses (left) and headphones (right) Alberto Frigo takes a selfie while peering through a set of binoculars . Unsurprisingly, photographs of Mr Frigo eating are common throughout the 12-year-long project .

"While dogs may learn about their world mainly through their nose, it appears cats prefer to rely on their eyesight. Domestic cats are known to have a sense of smell that is around fourteen times stronger than humans. However, in a test to find out what is the dominant feline sense, scientists found the animals tend to use their eyesight to find food. The eyes have it: cats tend to rely on their acute eyesight when searching for food rather than their nose . However, when deprived of the ability to see their food, cats revert to using their noses - especially if they have already learned what the food smells like. Large boxes, shoe boxes, and even just items that look like boxes – cats, it seems, can't resist squeezing into cardboard spaces. Scientists believe cats may be instinctively drawn to boxes because they offer security and shelter from predators while they stalk their prey. Veterinarian Claudia Vinke of Utrecht University in the Netherlands recently studied stress levels in shelter cats. She discovered that cats who had boxes got used to their new surroundings faster than those who did not because the boxes acted as a coping mechanism. Boxes may also offer safe places for cats to take a nap. Felines can sleep for 18 to 20 hours a day, so seeking out a hidden place would help their chances of survival in the wild. They could also be trying to escape unwanted attention. According toThe Domestic Cat: The Biology of its Behaviour, cats don't have good conflict resolution strategies and running and hiding is a coping mechanism for this. Professor Daniel Mills, a researcher in veterinary behavioural medicine at the University of Lincoln who oversaw the work, said: 'We tend to think of cats being very influenced by smells. 'We do wonder if it might partly be a result of domestication, as dogs too seem remarkably visual compared to wolves, but that really is speculation. 'If it is related to domestication, it might be because our faces are such a rich source of information for our pets.' Cats are known to have particularly acute vision and are able to see clearly in just one sixth of the light we need to see. Smell is also important - which is why they often rub against objects and owners - while their hearing is also usually sharp. However, little was known about which of their senses is the most dominant. The researchers, whose study is published in the journal of Applied Animal Behaviour Science, placed six cats in mazes that had presented them with two alternative choices. The cats were offered two pieces of paper at the same time containing a different picture of an object and odour. Choosing one combination of odour and visual stimuli won the cats a treat, while the other did not. After the cats had learned the rules, the researchers then mixed up the visual and odour stimuli so that the smell that lead to the treat was with the picture that did not and vice versa. Cats' sense of smell is fourteen times stronger than humans but it is not their dominant sense it seems . The scientists found that four of the six cats chose the visual cue that had led them to the treat over the smell. One of the cats tended to pick the route that contained the paper. When the scientists then removed the visual cues altogether and gave the cats a choice between smells, the cats consistently chose the smell that had been associated with a treat. Professor Mills said that it showed that while many cats used vision as their dominant sense, smell was still important to them. When they are first born kittens are blind and so rely upon smell to learn about the world around them but as they grow up their vision becomes more important for hunting and finding food than their other senses . He said the findings may also explain why some cats have a tendency to scent mark new objects when they come into a home and others do not. He said: 'One thing to realise is that some cats are very smell focused and others are more visual. 'So two individuals may respond very different to a similar change in the environment. 'For example we know many cats will spray on a new bag or article brought into the home, and perhaps this is because the cat is a smell orientated cat, whereas to a visual cat this is not as meaningful.'","Researchers at the University of Lincoln tested how cats search for food .

"Children must be taught how to make a profit if the country is to generate a new generation of entrepreneurs, David Cameron has said. The Prime Minister said schools should do more to develop the future Richard Bransons and Karren Bradys, adding that he wanted to see business leaders visiting schools to share their knowledge. Speaking to the Institute of Directors magazine he said: ‘Children need to know how money is made, about turning over a profit, about working in a team. The future Richard Bransons and Karren Bradys are out there. Prime Minsiter David Cameron, right, said schools should do more to create the next Karren Brady, left . 'We need to bring alive their ambition by showing them what they can do – and our top business people will do just that by sharing their own stories and passing on their hard-won knowledge.’ His advice came after a survey by PR firm Edelman showed trust in business had fallen by four points to 52 per cent in a year. Asked why he thought trust in business had fallen, Mr Cameron said: ‘It is natural that during and after a recession people worry more – about their pay packets, job security, and yes, also about the role that larger firms play. ‘But rather than focus on the negative, I would say people are still very supportive of keeping Britain’s economy free and open, welcoming investment from far and wide.’ ‘That said, businesses, especially large businesses, should consider how they can win back people’s trust - pay the tax they owe, ensure they do not exploit workers, protect employees and give them opportunities for pay and career progression.’ Mr Cameron, pictured, made the comments in an interview with the Institute of Directors Magazine .","David Cameron believes schools should do more to encourage business .

"Old Navy is introducing a new style of jeans coined 'skinny' and 'boyfriend' jeans for their children's line and some mothers across the country are deeming the styles inappropriate. The Gap owned affordable clothing chain touts jeggings, super skinny, skinny, boot-cut, and boyfriend skinny among its new looks. The jean styles for children are 'mini me' versions of the adult style of women's jeans which also include options like the diva, the flirt, and the sweetheart. Too young?: These young girls are modeling the new Old Navy boyfriend jean which is causing concern among some parents and psychologists . Trendy or too much?: Old Navy argues they are merely mirroring their adult styles of jeans in a playful way . 'Why not just call them 'loose fit?’' said Janet Choi, 41, a mother of two from Bushwick to the New York Daily News. Another mother added that the term skinny jean may urge some children to worry about their weight prematurely. ABC reports that a New York City psychologist said that the term 'boyfriend' shouldn't be applied to young children because they may feel the need to grow up too fast. 'Can’t we just buy jeans because we like them, and not have the ‘boyfriend’ label associated with them?,' said Joe Taravella, PhD and supervisor of pediatric psychology at Rusk Rehabilitation at New York University Langone Medical Center. 'It sets up our children to want and need a boyfriend, when at these early ages, this terminology should not be part of their vocabulary or on the radar of what they should be thinking about,' Taravella told ABC News. 'I am hard-pressed to understand why the label 'boyfriend' was associated with these jeans.' The New York Daily News also spoke with a psychologist who argued that insinuating romantic relationships in children's fashion may cause them to 'grow up too fast.' 'It’s another unfortunate example of how sexualization is getting younger and younger,' says Dr. Jennifer Hartstein, a child psychologist in Manhattan. New styles: Parents are outraged about the new boyfriend jeans for girls deemed too young to have a boyfriend or think about romantic relationships . 'It’s not so much the existence of the boyfriend jean that’s the problem. It’s the message that girls will pick up,' Hartstein adds. 'At (age) 2 she may not be so aware, but as she gets older, she will start to internalize these messages,' she says. ABC News spoke with the founder of Big City Moms, a resource center for New York based mothers with over 300,000 members. 'I think it’s just being true to their style names,' Leslie Venokur told ABC News. 'My kids don’t know what the style is called. I give them jeans and if the jeans are comfortable, they wear them.' Venokur who has children aged two and six says that the marketing is aimed at parents buying their children clothing modeled after their own style. 'Do they need to change it? No,' Venokur said . 'If they want to appease some opinionated parents, then that’s their call.' The New York Daily News reports that other comparable children’s designers don’t call looser pan 'boyfriend jeans.' H&M calls theirs 'denim pants' or 'loose-fit jeans.' OshKosh B’gosh and Gymboree don’t even offer the style. Abercrombie does sell boyfriend jeans, but only for older girls. Despite the complaints among some parents the brand does not plan on changing their whole campaign. Perfect or potentially harmful?: While some parents think the style is inappropriate, other moms claim their kids don't pay attention to the advertisements .","The Gap-owned affordable clothing chain Old Navy touts jeggings, super skinny, skinny, boot-cut, and boyfriend skinny among its new styles .

"SeaWorld reported a wider loss in its fourth quarter of $25.4 million as attendance to its theme parks continued to fall - due in part to the documentary 'Blackfish,' which criticizes the company's treatment of killer whales. Its shares fell in premarket trading Thursday. SeaWorld has been battling negative publicity after a 2013 documentary, 'Blackfish,' suggested that its treatment of animals may have led to the deaths of trainers. The documentary 2013 Blackfish highlighted the treatment of killer whales in captivity at SeaWorld and instigated a drop in park attendance . The marine parks are known for shows featuring killer whales and other animals. SeaWorld has taken out newspaper ads to defend its practices. And last year, the company said it would build larger environments for animals and fund additional research and programs to protect ocean health and whales in the wild. SeaWorld's chief executive resigned following low visitor numbers in the wake of the 2013 documentary Blackfish, which criticized the firm's treatment of killer whales. Jim Atchison, who had served as CEO and president since 2009, stepped down in January amid accusations that the company's treatment of killer whales may have led to the deaths of trainers. Attendance to the company’s 11 parks between October and December fell 2.2 percent to 4.4 million from 4.5 million in the same period a year ago. Attendance fell 4.3 percent during the entire year to 22.4 million from 23.4 million in 2013. Jim Atchison, former president and CEO SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, stepped down from his position following the release of the controversial film Blackfish . The Orlando, Florida-based company also said on Thursday that it expects to select a new CEO within the next six to nine months. Chairman David D’Alessandro took over as interim CEO in January after Jim Atchison stepped down. During the fourth quarter, the company reported a loss of $25.4 million, or 29 cents per share. That compares with a loss of $13 million, or 14 cents per share, in the same period a year before. Adjusted to remove one-time items, it had a loss of 21 cents per share, a larger loss than the 15 cent cents per share analysts expected, according to FactSet. Revenue fell 2.8 percent to $264.5 million, beating the $253.2 million that analysts expected. For 2014, the company reported net income of $49.9 million, or 57 cents per share, compared with $51.9 million, or 59 cents per share, in 2013. Adjusted earnings were 68 cents per share, below the 73 cents per share analysts expected. Revenue fell 5.6 percent to $1.38 billion in 2014, above the $1.37 billion analysts expected. Shares of SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. fell more than 7 percent in premarket trading Thursday. They are down about 41 percent in the last 12 months. SeaWorld lost more than finances this month. A beluga whale who was on loan to under-fire SeaWorld has died after fracturing his jaw during an 'interaction' with two other whales and later contracting an infection. Nanuq, who was around 31 or 32 years old, entertained millions of visitors at the firm's Orlando, Florida, theme park while on a long-term breeding loan from Canada's Vancouver Aquarium. Nanuq no more:  In this handout photo provided by SeaWorld San Diego, actor Will Ferrell shakes flippers with Nanuq, a 2,000-pound beluga whale that died this month . No more attendees: Less and less are going to see whales perform at Sea World following the documentary . But during a recent encounter with two of the three beluga whales he lived with, the 2200lbs marine creature suffered a fractured jaw. He later developed an infection and passed away on Thursday. Although Nanuq had been undergoing treatment for the infection at the time of his death, a post-mortem examination has been arranged to confirm the cause. The results are expected in weeks. Scott Smith, a University of South Carolina assistant hospitality professor, said Nanuq's death could be potentially damaging to SeaWorld following the release of Blackfish. 'It really is one of the worst times this kind of news could come out,' he said. 'Any other time, it probably wouldn’t even make a blip on the radar, but now everyone is watching SeaWorld.' Longtime SeaWorld critic and Animal Welfare Institute marine mammal scientist Naomi Rose added that in the wild, suffering a broken jaw from an 'interaction' with another animal seems unlikely. Speaking to the Orlando Sentinel, Ms Rose said: 'If he died because of something related to that infection he got related to the broken jaw, then he died of being in captivity.' Blackfish, which implied that the stress of life in captivity may have been responsible of an orca's killing of Orlando trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010, sparked widespread criticism of SeaWorld, . Since its release, attendance has declined at the company's parks in Orlando, San Diego, California and San Antonio, Texas. SeaWorld's stock value has also plummeted. To counter the backlash, the firm, which has participated in animal rescue programs for more than 50 years, has announced plans to nearly double the size of its orca enclosures in upcoming years. SeaWorld has not yet named a replacement for Mr Atchison.","SeaWorld reported a wider loss in its fourth quarter of $25.4 million as attendance to its theme parks continued to fall .

"It would be some people’s idea of a nightmare: a camera in the corner of the sitting room monitoring their family’s every movement. But experts at the Ideal Home Show predict this is the way many of us will live in future. Their vision of the ‘ideal smart home’ includes a small camera, housed in a pale wooden casing that would not look out of place on a mantelpiece. Withings say their home HD camera will allow family members to interact via tablet or PC when away from home, but campaigners say it could be used by controlling partners to keep an eye on one another . The £169.95 gadget can be used to film family life and stream HD footage to users’ tablet devices or mobile phones, even when they are away from home. Withings, the company which makes the ‘home camera’, boasts that its wide-angle lens means ‘no corner will go unseen’, even at night. When the sun sets, the camera automatically goes into Night Vision mode, ‘using an infrared mechanical filter to see through the darkness’. It will also record sound, monitor air quality and send users alerts when it detects sound or movement. According to Withings, this constant monitoring device will ‘facilitate family interactions’, by capturing moments together that some family members would not normally see. But privacy campaigners drew comparisons with Big Brother – the authoritarian state which watches people’s every move in 1984, the dystopian novel by George Orwell. Other gadgets featuring at the Ideal Home Show include the Pantelligent frying pan which links to a smartphone and tells you how long to cook food for . Controlling partners could constantly use it to monitor family members. Renate Samson, of campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘This is keeping an eye on people, not interacting with them. There is no privacy in your own home, from your own family.’ Other gadgets in the Ideal Home Show’s vision of the future are less controversial. People in flats too small for a dining table could try the Picture Table, a pack away table that can be turned into a framed mirror and hung on the wall. The Pantelligent frying pan sends information to the users’ tablet or mobile phone, telling them how much longer to cook their food. The Ideal Home Show opens on March 20 at the Olympia London exhibition centre.","Withings home HD camera boasts 'wide angle' lens to cover entire room .

"Hannah Delmonte is already Prom Queen -  even though the big event isn't until May. The Virginia girl, a Philadelphia Eagles fan since birth, started a Twitter campaign to have her favorite player, linebacker Emmanuel Acho, be her date for the big night, figuring she'd 'give it a shot'. The 16-year-year-old sent the NFL player a direct message on Instagram, asking whether he would take her to her junior prom if she got 2,000 retweets. Acho replied within an hour. 'I raised the bar and I said, ''If you get 10,000, you got a deal'',' he later told ABC News. 'No way!' An overwhelmed Hannah Delmonte, 16, cries with shock as Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Emmanual Acho, 24, arrives at her school in Pucelville, Virginia, last week . Date night: After a social media campaign went her way, Delmonte is now going to her junior prom with Acho, who had a special Eagles jersey made up for his date . Miss Delmonte amassed 15,000 retweets in three hours. 'After that, I said, ''Ok, I'm going to prom and how can I make this an extremely special event for her?'' Acho said. So last Friday, 24-year-old Acho traveled from the University of Texas at Austin - where attends graduate school when he's not playing for the Eagles - to Woodgrove High School in Purcellville, Virginia, where Delmonte attends. 'I saw him and at first it didn't register all the way,' Hannah told ABC. 'Then I realized it was him. I was shocked and overwhelmed. He didn't know what to say at first because I was crying, but he actually did say, ''Will you go to prom with me?'' And in case Delmonte didn't know why he was there, Acho was armed with a specially-made Eagles jersey that said 'PROM' on the back. Shock: Acho was just as surprised to see the student amass so many retweets in such a short time . After dealing with the shock, Delmonte is now madly searching for a dress in the signature Eagles shade of green. Acho, of course, will be in a tuxedo with a green bow tie for the May 9 prom. He is also trying to think of ways to make the night even more special. 'I am trying to figure out where to buy a corsage,' he told ABC, laughing. 'I've gotten offers from different car services but, yeah, I also play a little piano and sing. 'We'll see if I have a special musical performance.' The gesture also seems to have had as much of an affect on Acho as it has on Delmonte. 'Saying it was humbling is so cliché,' Acho said. 'It's a very heartwarming feeling because I never realize the impact I have on other people until that moment. When I saw her cry, I truly realized that I play a big impact on people's lives.'

"The parents of an 18-year-old boy who suffered a devastating brain haemorrhage while diving for cray fish have hailed his recovery a ‘miracle’ after doctors told them their son would not survive and set the wheels in motion for his organs to be donated. Simon Phillips and his son Ben were out diving near their home at Geraldton’s Point Moore, WA, one Saturday morning when the experienced diver told his father he had a headache and was heading back to the boat. ‘I didn’t think too much of it because I thought it was shallow water blackout,’ Simon told Daily Mail Australia. Doctors believed Ben Phillips, seen here in intensive care, had no chance of surviving bleeding on the brain . This photo of Ben was taken two days before his bleed out on 23 October  at his final school assembly where Ben was deputy head boy . ‘We tend to get a bit of a head rush when we push ourselves too hard… but when two friends shouted out to say goodaye to Ben he said he had really bad headache and started vomiting over the boat.’ Simon had no idea that an Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) in Ben's brain which had been lying dormant since his birth had ruptured and caused life threatening bleeding. He rushed his son to the emergency department at Geraldton Hospital on October 25, while Ben drifted in and out of consciousness. ‘I knew something was wrong but didn’t think it was to the point of death,’ Simon recalled. ‘While in the car, I was just talking to him saying “Ben you need to stay with me” but still not recognising the desperation of the situation.’ When they reached the hospital Ben was quickly given a CT scan which discovered the AVM in his head. An AVM is described as a tangle of blood vessels in the brain or on its surface which bypasses normal brain tissue and directly diverts blood from the arteries to the vein. ‘The bleed was so extensive they said the outcome wasn’t good… that became real to us and they asked whether we would be keen on donating Ben’s organs,’ Simon said. Ben is seen here on the left with his father Simon and elder brother Zacc . Ben's family including his mum Amanda (centre) are closer than ever after the traumatic experience . During the rush to the hospital Simon called his wife Amanda and told her ‘you better get to the hospital’. ‘I just walked in and the look on the nurse’s face said it all. She said “come straight through on your own”,’ Amanda remembered. ‘They took me through the curtains and a nurse came to me and said “don’t panic but it’s confronting”. She opened the curtains and he was on life support right at that moment I still didn’t realise how serious it was, I just thought maybe he’d been hit on the head while coming up from the drive.’ Amanda recalls thinking ‘we were going to be late for his graduation dinner.’ ‘He was going to be singing at the Year 12 dinner that night… I thought “what the heck is going on”… there was silence in the room with the doctors and nurses not saying much. ‘It just got worse, the feeling in the room got worse.’ This photo was taken of Ben as he finally left hospital on February 2 after three and a half months . Ben and his father regularly go diving. In this photo he is seen spearfishing . Simon and his wife Amanda began praying and received a huge amount of support from their local and religious community and churches around the world. ‘The support has been tremendous; way beyond anything we expected it was crazy,’ Simon said. The doctors told Amanda and Simon more scans had shown a massive bleed on the brain and a top neurosurgeon in Perth told them ‘there is no chance of survival’. ‘As a mum I felt like everything had all of a sudden drained form the top of me all the way to my feet. I felt faint and it just got worse. This week Ben got back on his paddle board for the first time since October . Doctors hope that Ben will be back to full health within two years and able to surf and dive again within six months . ‘The other doctor came in and said “I know it’s bad timing but we need to know if Ben would be happy to donate his organs”,’ Amanda said. One of Amanda’s other two sons advised his mother that it was what Ben would have wanted and they began the process of moving him to Perth for his organs to be donated. ‘Ben and I got in the ambulance and about 30 people came to say goodbye, six of them very close friends, his grandparents and cousins. Everybody came because they were told to say goodbye… it was tough to see all the boys crying.’ An air ambulance flew Ben and Amanda to Perth where she held his hand the whole way and didn’t stop crying. ‘It was unbelievable and surreal and then I thought about his funeral, what he would like. I thought about his suit I had bought him. He had the school ball coming up, maybe he wouldn’t want to wear that to his funeral maybe he would want to wear boardies and a singlet?’ Amanda remembered. ‘I had to be there I couldn’t let him go on his own.’ It was when Ben reached Perth that the unimaginable happened. Ben planned to perform at his school graduation before the freak incident . The 18-year-old is seen in recovery here with his two elder brothers . While a nurse did routine checks for any movement Ben miraculously responded. ‘She said “you might want to turn away now” and she pushed really hard on his chest. He responded quiet strongly so I heard her say “I’m sorry darling”,’ Amanda said. Not long after that Simon and their middle son Zacc,19, arrived at the hospital, where their oldest son Kallan, 22, was too. ‘We were all in the room together, the five of us. The neurosurgeon came in and gave us a glimmer of hope as Ben had responded to the chest pain… he said “we’re willing to give it a go to try and save him”,’ Amanda said. A tense seven hour operation with no guarantees followed and finally at around 3am the family got the call to say Ben had made it. Amanda held her son Ben's hand the whole way to Perth and didn’t stop crying . Ben's mother Amanda told of the amazing moment the neurosurgeon told the family that Ben had responded for the first time . ‘It was then a good two weeks of up and down… it was a slow progress but it finally came, Ben responded to commands to squeeze the nurse’s hand.’ ‘It’s a miracle, he’s Geraldton’s own Lazarus… it was very much Jesus saying ""didn’t I tell you that I believed you would see the glory of God"",’ Simon said. Amazingly Ben has suffered no serious brain damage and doctors predict he will be fully recovered within two years with therapy. ‘I cried every day for three weeks. Every time I saw him it was heart wrenching… To think something like that can change in a moment. I’d just told him off about cleaning his room,’ Amanda said. Four months on, Ben has returned to the ocean to paddle board and once he’s got the all-clear from doctors it’s hoped he will be able to drive and dive again within six months. ‘He’s very grateful for his life because there was a point when everything went down and he was in a dingy by himself. He thought “I’m going to die, this is the end”. ‘He is very much aware that his life has been spared for a reason for a purpose and he’s very grateful for his life and very thankful to God,’ Simon said of his son Ben. The family said the traumatic experience has brought them closer together.","Ben Phillips suffered extensive bleeding on the brain while cray fishing .

"Growing reach: Russia has gained a foothold in Europe after President Vladimir Putin, pictured, signed a deal with Cyprus to dock warships there . Russia has gained a military foothold in Europe after Vladimir Putin signed a controversial deal with Cyprus to dock warships there. British MPs said Nicosia’s decision to let the Russian navy, including heavily armed frigates, use its ports for counter-terrorism and anti-piracy was ‘worrying and disappointing’. Cyprus, an EU member, thrashed out the agreement despite already hosting two British military bases and 3,200 troops. President Putin insisted the deal ‘should not cause worries anywhere’. But Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades, who was visiting Moscow, hinted Russian warplanes could also be allowed to use a military airbase in Paphos, on the south-west coast of the island. The deal raised eyebrows as tensions between the West and Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine continue to rise. It will be watched warily by the UK, which has led calls for a string of punishing economic sanctions against Moscow for arming pro-Kremlin separatists who have taken over huge swathes of territory. On Tuesday, Britain announced it would deploy 75 troops to Ukraine as trainers – a move certain to have infuriated Putin. Russian bombers have recently buzzed UK airspace in a show of strength. The latest agreement fuelled speculation that the Kremlin had engineered the deal by putting together a multibillion-pound package to bail out debt-ridden Cyprus. The two countries, which have long had close economic ties, signed protocols including fresh financial deals between Cyprus and the Central Bank of Russia. There had already been a surge in Russian navy visits to the Cypriot port of Limassol, but the new agreement puts the situation on more solid legal ground. Tory MP Richard Ottaway, chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said: ‘It is going to make renewing sanctions against Russia … much more unlikely. 'Putin is trying to drive a wedge between countries in the EU.’ Heavily armed: A 2003 picture of Russia's nuclear-powered cruiser Peter the Great, which could soon be sailing in the Mediterranean from new bases in Cyprus after the deal was sealed with Russia . A senior British Army officer said: ‘This will be watched closely by London. We know Russia has long coveted a naval base in Cyprus. 'This is another sign we are creeping back into a new Cold War.’ Dr James Ker-Lindsay, an expert on the politics of south-east Europe at the London School of Economics, said many in the EU ‘will feel worried and disappointed by this agreement’. He said Cyprus felt the EU had not helped it at the height of the financial crisis, yet Russian businesses and oligarchs stayed and did not withdraw their money. Unveiling the deal, President Putin said: ‘Our friendly ties aren’t aimed against anyone. I don’t think it should cause worries anywhere.’ ■ Warring sides in Ukraine last night declared the start of a withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line. But the country’s Defence Ministry warned that its troops were still ‘in a state of total readiness to defend the country’.","The EU member already hosts two British bases with 3,200 troops .

"America has its first all-vegan elementary school thanks to James Cameron's wife Suzy Amis. The Avatar director and his wife founded MUSE School in Calabasas, California, and Suzy announced last week their students will no longer eat, nor will the school utilize, any meat products, reports the Hollywood Reporter. 'Meals that are served at Muse will be 100 percent plant-based. The average person would say vegan, but we say whole food, plant-based. It's about raising kids who don't think it's strange or exotic or worthy of a pat on the back to be doing the right thing for the living biosphere.' Earthy: America has its first all-vegan elementary school thanks to James Cameron's wife Suzy Amis. The non-traditional private school is nestled in nature in the hills of Southern California and claims, per their website, to 'give each a voice in choosing curriculum based on what they like, how they learn, where they find fun, and what they need.' Amis, Cameron's fifth wife, made the announcement at LA's Chateau Marmont for an event where she was introducing a line of dresses whose sales will benefit the environmentally focused school. The celebrity standard-bearers for a vegan lifestyle aren't just wispy young actresses. They include talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres, along with wife Portia de Rossi.

Starting in the fall, Amis announced last week that 'meals that are served at Muse will be 100 percent plant-based.

Athletes like Carl Lewis and Mike Tyson. Even NFL player Tony Gonzalez, tight end for the Atlanta Falcons and 245-plus pounds — attributes his longevity to a largely vegan diet. And then there are the moguls, like billionaire publisher, real estate developer and recent avowed vegan Mort Zuckerman, and Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas casino magnate, who's hired a vegan chef and put vegan options in all his resort restaurants. Biz Stone, the co-founder of Twitter, also has spoken of his veganism. Of all the high-profile vegans, though, Bill Clinton is the biggest 'catch.' Advocates were thrilled and stunned when he talked about it on CNN, telling Wolf Blitzer that his impressive, 24-pound weight loss was due to a largely plant-based diet — a regime he believes will prolong his life.

An attack on Mariupol (pictured) would amount to a huge escalation in the conflict in eastern Ukraine . 'It is not our assessment that he is bent on capturing or conquering all of Ukraine,' said James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence. 'He wants a whole entity composed of the two oblasts (regions) in eastern Ukraine which would include a land bridge to Crimea and perhaps a port, specifically Mariupol. 'We do not believe that an attack on Mariupol is imminent. I believe they will wait until the spring before they attack.' Ahead of a ceasefire, which has led to a lull in fighting in recent days, there were acute fears that pro-Moscow rebels were preparing an assault on Mariupol, a Sea of Azov port. Rebels were now 'reconstituting and regrouping', he warned. Moscow has struggled to supply Crimea from mainland Russia since annexing the Black Sea peninsula a year ago.

This was his 'personal view' and not necessarily the position of US intelligence agencies, but he acknowledged that such a move could upset Putin and encourage him to give more powerful weapons to rebels. The head of military intelligence, Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart, appeared to disagree with him, telling the same US Senate hearing that the Rusisans 'will up the ante if we do any lethal aid or take any actions to bolster the equation'.

"Green initiatives: Energy Secretary Ed Davey announced agreements to buy energy from 27 new renewable energy projects until 2040 . More than £4billion in lucrative energy contracts was yesterday handed out to wind and solar schemes – but green lobbyists immediately insisted it was not enough. Energy Secretary Ed Davey announced agreements to buy energy from 27 new renewable energy projects until 2040. The subsidised schemes include 15 onshore wind farms, five solar arrays, two offshore wind programmes and five waste conversion plants. Mr Davey said the schemes will eventually power 1.4million homes. But parts of the green energy industry said they had not been treated fairly in the bidding process. The ‘Contracts for Difference’ scheme, which will guarantee energy firms a fixed price for their power for 15 years, will be funded by ordinary householders through their electricity bills. The scheme adds a subsidy on to the basic wholesale cost of electricity as part of the Government’s drive to expand renewable energy projects. The subsidies will cost up to £315million a year - an estimated total of at least £4billion over the lifetime of the scheme once fluctuations in the energy market are taken into account. Solar industry leaders complained that wind had been favoured by the Government, despite solar being cheaper. Paul Barwell, chief executive of the Solar Trade Association, said: ‘The soon to be cheapest and most popular renewable - solar power - has lost out in a complex auction scheme that favours big players and genuinely established technologies. ‘Is a policy that trips up the UK’s emerging solar industry really a successful policy? We don’t think so.’ Alex Fornal, head of project development at Solar company Juwi, which made three unsuccessful bids, said wind had taken most of what was already a ‘minuscule’ budget. ‘If properly supported solar will become the first renewable to compete with conventional generation by the end of the decade,’ he said. Simon Bullock of Friends of the Earth added: ‘Ministers should be investing far more on the UK’s huge renewable energy potential.’ Critics of renewable energy subsidies said green power firms needed to ‘grow up’. John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, said: ‘This industry is behaving like a spoiled brat - you can never give it enough subsidies, it will always want more. ‘They have to grow up and come into the real world and compete.’ Windmills: Solar industry leaders complained that wind had been favoured by the Government . Mr Davey insisted the ‘reverse auction’ process - in which lower bids were favoured for the contracts - would save bill-payers a total of £110million a year. ‘This world-leading auction has delivered contracts for renewables projects right across the UK,’ he said. ‘These projects could power 1.4 million homes, create thousands of green jobs and give a massive boost to home-grown energy while reducing our reliance on volatile foreign markets. ‘The auction has driven down prices and secured the best possible deal for this new clean, green energy.’ The Government’s independent Committee on Climate Change estimates that green subsidies and taxes currently add £45 to dual gas and electricity bills – a figure that will rise to £100 by 2020 and £175 by 2030.","The schemes include 15 onshore wind farms and five solar arrays .

"Women in Australia are earning a record 18.8 per cent less per week than their male counterparts, a shocking new report has found. The gender pay gap between everyday Australians is the worst it’s been in more than twenty years, despite an ever-growing movement  calling for equal pay for men and women. Data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) shows the average ordinary full-time earnings for men rose to $1,587.50 per week, while their female colleagues received $298.10 less. It is the largest pay gap recorded since the ABS began collecting the data in 1994. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Prime Minister Tony Abbott – who also acts as the Minister for Women – for comment. The gender pay gap between everyday Australians working full-time is the worst it’s been in twenty years . Associate Professor Rae Cooper from the University of Sydney Business School’s Discipline of Work and Organisational Studies told Daily Mail Australia the findings are even more shocking because it’s the second year in a row the gap has grown. ‘I was shocked last time around when it was the highest in 20 years at 18.2 per cent and now it’s 18.8 per cent,’ Professor Cooper said. ‘It’s really concerning in a sense because there’s only been a modest wage growth. Wages have only gone up a little bit but the gap has grown massively.’ The reasons the gap keeps growing are complex, Professor Cooper said. ‘There is sticky floor, that’s the biggest cause, women get stuck in low level non-career track jobs,' she said. 'But it’s also a story about glass walls. Women are segregated into particular industries and those industries are low paid.’ Data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows the average ordinary full-time earnings for men rose to $1,587.50 per week while their female colleagues received $298.10 less . Across the board the pay gap of average weekly ordinary time earnings is about $300 a week . Some employers – particularly large ones – are now giving more information on the scale of the problem and where it is but Professor Cooper said ‘what we’re not seeing is a lot of movement in response’. ‘How many times can we hear that there is a pay gap in every occupation and every level, it’s not a question of if there is one but the scale of it.’ Professor Cooper said that across the board the pay gap of average weekly ordinary time earnings is about $300 a week. This number does not include part time workers, casual staff or bonuses. Women who work in education have about a $200 gap from their male counterparts. Men in education earn $1,700 a week on average and women get $1,486. In finance, there is a $600 gap and mining there is an almost $500 gap. Men in the mining industry earn an average a week $2459.50, while women get $2014. Males in the mining industry earn an average a week $2459.50, while women get $2014 . These figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics from November 2014 visibly shows the pay gap between men and women (the blue graph is male earnings) This purple graph illustrates how women working full-time are still earning much less then their male counterparts . Essentially, women in Australia 'should take Friday off to compensate for the 18.8 per cent difference', Professor Cooper joked. The ABS’s findings were released after Employment Minister Eric Abetz announced plans to scale back business red tape on gender reporting. Extra gender reporting requirements were due to apply from April 1 covering job applications, interviews, the salaries of chief executives and parental leave. The government says after public consultation it will scrap the extra requirements but maintain existing arrangements. Men in education earn $1,700 a week on average and women get $1,486 .

However, it’s believed the Liberal's plans may fail in the Senate. Under laws introduced by the previous Labor government, businesses with 100 or more employees are required to provide the Workplace Gender Equality Agency with data on pay, recruitment, retention and promotions. Australian Greens senator Larissa Waters has flagged a disallowance motion in the Senate if she can't convince the government to change its mind. Senator Waters said data on managerial level job applications and interviews was critical because it would show where the glass ceiling was most impenetrable.","Australian women in full-time work earn 18.8 per cent less than men .

"Twitter's boss recently admitted the social network 'sucks' at dealing with trolls and now the site is making good on its promise to clamp down on these abusive accounts. Reports from The Verge claim the site will start banning users who violate its rules by tracking  email addresses and phone numbers. This means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details Twitter will be able to intervene. Reports claim Twitter will start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers. When people sign up they are required to give an email address, but adding a  number (pictured) is optional. To solve this issue, Twitter may  ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide a phone number . When people sign up to Twitter they are required to provide an email address, which is then validated. Adding a phone number is an optional step and is predominantly used if people want to receive text notifications or setup two-step verification. Under the reported plans, once a user is banned these email addresses and phone numbers will be stored and cross-referenced each time a new user signs up to the site. It is not known how this information will be stored and how specifically it will be used and MailOnline has contacted Twitter for more information. Stories of abuse, threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on Twitter in recent years. Robin Williams’ daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father’s suicide. Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian was threatened with rape, sexual violence and death by Twitter trolls during the 'Gamergate' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games. In the UK, journalist Caroline Criado-Perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce Jane Austen as the new face of the £10 note. Twitter users Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo admitted sending the messages to Ms Criado-Perez and both were jailed last year. Although this is a positive step, the system is unlikely to catch trolls if they sign up for accounts with multiple email addresses. Similarly, as adding a phone number is optional, this won't always be possible to track. But The Verge continued  Twitter may temporarily ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide a phone number to get round this issue. Earlier this month, an internal memo sent by Twitter's chief executive Dick Costolo revealed the 51-year-old thinks his site ‘sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls’. In the memo, Mr Costolo said  he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future. Mr Costolo’s comments were posted on an internal forum among Twitter employees, after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse. In December, a blog post titled 'Building a safer Twitter' revealed  Twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse. The site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile-friendly, and it now requires less initial information.

The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500. Since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet, e-mail and social networking, prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge Twitter trolls. Student Liam Stacey, who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed, was charged under the Crime and Disorder Act. Two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the Serious Crime Act, and Paul Chambers, who joked he would blow Doncaster airport 'sky high' was charged under the Communications Act 2003.

'Overall, we now review five times as many user reports as we did previously, and we have tripled the size of the support team focused on handling abuse reports. 'We are also beginning to add several new enforcement actions for use against accounts that violate our rules.

"Prince Harry is planning to leave the armed forces this year and devote his time to more charity work, pictured at Camp Bastion . Prince Harry is to leave the Armed Forces within six months to pursue charity work with injured service personnel. The captain in the Blues and Royals is expected to spend much of the next year in Australia, New Zealand and Africa, where he has links with charities. Senior royal sources said Harry, 30, was at a ‘crossroads’ in his military career. ‘Although the military will always be a huge part of his life, he is at a point when he needs to make significant decisions about his career and the prince believes he can best serve the charities he wants to work with, particularly those helping service personnel, as a civilian,’ said one. It is clear to many who work with Harry that since returning from Afghanistan he has been struggling to find a suitable long-term military role that can be combined with the causes close to his heart. Kensington Palace declined to comment yesterday on reports of his decision to quit because the fine details are still being worked through. The Mail understands, however, that he is likely to leave by the end of the summer. Before then he will spend several weeks with the military in Australia as well as representing the UK, along with his father, Prince Charles, at the 100th anniversary Anzac Day commemorations in Gallipoli. Last year Harry devised and organised the Invictus Games, a remarkable Para-lympics-style event for wounded servicemen and women which attracted 400 competitors from 13 nations and was lauded as an unqualified success. Despite that, some senior royal commentators question the wisdom of leaving the forces – which have given the once wayward prince so much direction in his life. Many believe Prince Andrew’s decision in 2001 to leave the Royal Navy, where he had a distinguished career, caused some of the problems that have dogged him recently. When Prince Harry leaves the Army, the Royal Family will have no senior members on full-time active military service. Harry has served twice on the front line in Afghanistan since graduating from Sandhurst in May 2005. He was first sent out as a forward air controller in 2007 after his wish to serve in the infantry was deemed too dangerous to both himself and his men. The young royal, 30, served two tours of duty on the front line in Afghanistan, pictured making pre-flight checks on an Apache helicopter in Camp Bastion . The angry prince was forced to return early from the posting when an American website broke the news blackout on his deployment. He then retrained with the Army Air Corps and was picked to fly the Apache attack helicopter. He returned to Afghanistan in 2012. He left last year to take up a Staff Officer role in London to work on his plan to bring the Invictus Games to Britain. His move to the capital brought him back to his then girlfriend, Cressida Bonas. But when the romance ended, he realised he had little appetite to progress up the ranks. He is now focused on working for the Ministry of Defence’s recovery capability programme. It involves working alongside case officers in London’s Personnel Recovery Unit and visiting recovery centres, Forces charities and NHS units. A source added: ‘What he is doing now is helping him develop his knowledge of how the system works. The military will always play a very important part in Prince Harry’s life and especially supporting those who have served or are serving in the Armed Forces.’ He is keen to pursue his interests in 'conservation and wildlife' and hopes to spend a time on field projects in Africa, pictured playing with  children during a visit to Phelisanong Children's Home  in  Lesotho . Prince Harry passed the  qualification necessary to train at Sandhurst, in September 2004. He entered The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 2005 and Clarence House announced that he was to join the Blues and Royals the following year as an officer cadet. It was announced that had been serving with the British Army in Helmand, Afghanistan for more than two months in 2008. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant with The Household Cavalry (Blues and Royals) and then begin training to become and Army Air Corps Pilot in January 2009. Prince Harry spent three and a half years in training and operational service with the Apache Force during his attachment to the Army Air Corps. The royal  has undertaken two operational tours of Afghanistan, as a Forward Air Controller in 2007 to 2008 and as an Apache Pilot between September 2012 and January 2013. During his time in the Army Air Corps he was assigned to 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment within 16 Air Assault Brigade and in July 2013, Prince Harry qualified as an Apache Aircraft Commander. He was promoted to the rank of Captain in April 2011 and was also awarded his Apache Badge from the Officer in Command of his Squadron at the same time. The Prince, who currently has the rank of Captain, took up a Staff Officer role in London  in 2014. Pray Prince Harry doesn't make his uncle Andrew's mistakes, says RICHARD KAY, editor-at-large . Warrior prince: Harry on patrol in Afghanistan . For as long as he can remember, Prince Harry wanted to be a soldier. Aged eight, he sat in a Scimitar armoured vehicle in combat fatigues and camouflage paint, beaming as Princess Diana took the salute at a Light Dragoons base in Germany. While his brother William daydreamed about being a policeman – so he could better ‘protect’ their mother – Harry yearned for active service. This ambition drove him from Eton’s combined cadet force, where he narrowly missed out on winning the prized Sword of Honour, to Sandhurst military academy, and finally active service with the Blues and Royals. Two tours of Afghanistan followed, including one as an Army Air corps Apache pilot after he retrained to fly helicopters. So his decision to end a military career just ten years after it began cannot have been an easy one. It had, after all, seemed he was destined to become one of the few members of the Royal Family to actually earn most of those medals that routinely cover their chests. But life in the military represented a paradox for the warrior prince. Instead of helping him find the freedom he sought away from the heart of the Royal Family, it increasingly began to suffocate him. The restrictions imposed on him because of who he was meant the top brass were not prepared to allow him the luxury – as he saw it – of the further front line posting he craved. The Army proposed a desk job, a position which Harry is neither emotionally nor intellectually equipped to handle. He was, I am told, ‘desperate’ to stay in uniform but not at any price, and will now seek to find a new life concentrating on charity projects. If alarm bells are not ringing at this woolly if honourable prospect, then they should be. For there are some uneasy parallels with another significant royal figure who abandoned a military career to seek a new direction – Harry’s uncle Prince Andrew, who has never found a meaningful role since quitting the Navy in 2001. Once a heartbeat or two away from the throne as Charles’s brother, Andrew has slipped down the pecking order with the arrival of a new generation of princes. Now it’s Harry’s turn to slide down the line of succession. First George, and then in April – when the Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth – another royal infant will vault ahead of him. So at 30, and unmarried, Harry has momentous decisions to make about his future. Andrew was a divorcee and over 40 when he left the Senior Service, only to stagger from one disreputable episode to another in a kind of extended midlife crisis, culminating in the current scandal in which he stands accused of sleeping with an underage girl – which he robustly denies – and consorting with a known paedophile. Harry's youthful indiscretions – underage drinking, smoking pot and dressing in Nazi regalia for a party – seem piffling by contrast. And as one figure who has been around him all his life tells me: ‘The difference between Harry and Andrew is vast. Harry is a nice guy whereas Andrew is arrogant. Yes, Harry has been a bit misguided at times, but he is intelligent enough to realise he must learn from his mistakes.’ When Diana was with him that day in Germany in 1993, she saw a confident figure better equipped for royal duty than William, and privately described him to friends as ‘good king Harry’. What happens next to harness those qualities is crucial. Hugely popular with the public he may be, but that fondness may leach away if he returns to the sybaritic lifestyle of a party prince. Harry stands at a crossroads. Now, we must hope this charismatic young man chooses the correct path.","Prince Harry is planning to leave the armed forces later this year .

"Jeb Bush sounded more like his older brother than himself on Friday at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, winning over many conservative activists in what is known as hostile terrority for political moderates like him. Mixing jokes with firm policy positions, the former Florida governor ditched the wooden posture that earned him low marks during recent speeches in Detroit and Chicago, stepping out from behind a podium and engaging in 20 minutes of one-on-one with Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity. Bush tackled head-on the two subject that have made him an object of scorn on the Republican Party's right wing – immigration policy and so-called 'Common Core' national education standards. Talk of a protest walkout by disaffected right-wingers never materialized beyond a handful of attendees heading to the exits after a stemwinder by the president of the National Rifle Association. THIRD BUSH IN LINE: Jeb would join his father and brother as White House occupants if he were to seize the brass ring in 2016 . SPRING IN HIS STEP: Bush won friends among conservatives by talking to the audience instead of reading from prepared remarks . The Common Core standards have aroused loud protests on the right, and Bush laid out his support for the plan in November saying 'the rigor of Common Core state standards must be the new minimum in classrooms.' But on Friday he sought to distance himself from that statement and seemed to sympathize with the abti-Big-Government crowd gathered near the nation's capital. 'With this president and this Department of Education,' Bush allowed, 'there's a risk that they will intrude, and they have,' on the states. Republicans, he said, should insist taht 'the federal government has no role in the creation of standards, either directly or indirectly.' He also said the party must demand that Washington stay out of local schools' curriculum decisions and keep its hands off information collected for student ID cards. But the idea of raising the bar for education standards and requiring schools to prove they are meeting them, he insisted, is sound. 'If there's no consequence between mediocrity and failure, or excellence, then the system won't move forward,' Bush said. The immigration mess Bush finds himself in is thornier. in April 2014 he said at an event marking the 15th anniversary of his father's presidency that many illegal immigrants cross America's southern border with good intentions. 'Someone who comes to our country because they couldn’t come legally, they come to our country because their families – the dad who loved their children – was worried that their children didn’t have food on the table,' he said. 'And they wanted to make sure their family was intact, and they crossed the border because they had no other means to work to be able to provide for their family. Yes, they broke the law, but it’s not a felony. It’s an act of love. It’s an act of commitment to your family.' Conservative voters remember this and many booed Bush in anticipation of a smackdown when Hannity read the words back to him. The catcalls tripled in volume when Bush was reinded that he had green-lighted lower college tuition – the rates paid by students who live in Florida – for illegal immigrants attending state-run universities. 'For those who made an ‘oo’ sound – is that what it was?' he asked with a grin. 'I’m marking you down as neutral and I want to be your second choice.' The boos mixed with some cheers when Bush laid out his position more unapologetically. 'There is no plan to deport 11 million people,' he said. 'We should give them a path to legal status' provided that 'they don't break the law, they learn English and they make a contribution to society.' HOT-BUTTONS: Immigration and Commone Core education standards are stumbling blocks for Bush but he explained his positions and didn't back down . That position distinguishes him from most other Republicans in the hunt for the presidency, most of whom castigated the Obama White House for an 'amnesty' plan that threatens to mainstream 5 million or more people in the country illegally. But if he were to win the tense nomination fight, his stance would be a carbon copy of what any Democrat might offer – a situation that red-meat conservatives see as a capitulation. Bush split the difference by agreeing with the capacity crowd about President Obama's executive actions. 'The president did use authority he didn't have,' Bush said. 'The courts are going to overturn that.' 'I think the Congress ought to pass a bill that does not allow him to use that authority. ... The president has gone way beyond his constitutional powers to do this, and the Congress has every right to reinstate their responsibility for what the law is about.' Bush is fashioning a strategy that calls for pegging the immigration fight to jobs and economic growth. On Friday the White House announced that the Amercan economy grew by 2.2 per cent in the last quarter of 2014. With a 4 per cent growth, Bush said, there would be enough jobs for everyone in the U.S., whether or not they had the legal right to work. He encouraged the crown not to 'believe that the pie is static – that's the left's point of view.' 'If we grow at 4 per cent there's going to be opportunities for all.'","Gone was the awkward, middle-distance-staring Jeb from recent speeches in Chicago and Detroit .

"Human body parts that fell from the sky in Saudi Arabia could be the remains of someone trapped in an aircraft's undercarriage bay, police have revealed. Officers said the grisly incident happened near the centre of the Red Sea city of Jeddah, just south of King Abdulaziz International Airport, early this morning. Force spokesman Nawaf bin Naser al-Bouq said: 'Police received a telephone call at 2.30 am from a witness reporting the fall of human remains at an intersection in Mushrefa neighbourhood.' A plane is pictured after an emergency landing at Medina airport. Twenty nine people were injured . Initial indications were that the remains 'fell from a plane's landing gear,' said Bouq, adding that investigations were ongoing. The report came after a Saudi Arabian Airlines jet made an emergency landing in the city of Medina in the west of the kingdom, injuring 29 people on Sunday. That aircraft had been travelling from Iran's second city of Mashhad with 315 people on board. A spokesman for the General Authority of Civil Aviation said there was no connection between the emergency landing in Medina and the Jeddah incident. The Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) Boeing 767-300ER made an emergency landing at Medina airport in the west of the country early on Sunday, the General Authority of Civil Aviation said . The bod parts fell from the sky over the Red Sea city of Jeddah, on Saudi Arabia's western coast . In a desperate attempt to cross borders, some people at poorly monitored airports climb inside the bays housing aircraft landing gear. Most of them freeze to death once the aircraft reach cruising altitude, but some survive. In 2010, the head of Beirut's airport security resigned after the death of a man who managed to hide in the undercarriage bay of a Saudi-bound jet. The man's body was found by a maintenance worker who was inspecting the gear of the Saudi-owned Nas Air Airbus A-320 after it landed in Riyadh.","Officers said incident happened near the Red Sea city of Jeddah .

"Guilty: Anthony McSweeney has been convicted of indecent assault on a young boy 35 years ago . A Catholic priest dubbed the 'fat vicar' was today found guilty of sexually abusing a boy in a care home and downloading child porn onto his computer. Father Anthony McSweeney, 68, faces jail after he was convicted of preying on the vulnerable boy while he was working at Grafton Close Children's Home in Hounslow, west London, more than 30 years ago. The care home was run by McSweeney's friend John Stingemore, who was found dead in January weeks before he was due to stand trial alongside the priest. Southwark Crown Court heard that McSweeney watched young boys shower for his own sexual gratification, and kept a collection of child porn at home. He denied being a paedophile - but today a jury of six men and five women found him guilty of indecent assault and three counts of making indecent images of children. The attack on the young boy took place between 1979 and 1981, while the child porn was found on his laptop after he was arrested in 2013. McSweeney was cleared of three indecent assaults on two other boys at the care home and taking a pornographic photo of one of these boys. The 20st priest was once enlisted by TV cook Delia Smith to hold a special football service at Norwich City. And he officiated at the 1990 wedding of boxing star Frank Bruno and his now ex-wife Laura. McSweeney was investigated as part of Operation Fernbridge, the police probe into an alleged VIP paedophile ring at Grafton Close and Elms Guest House in Barnes, west London. Stingemore used his connections to help get his close friend a job at Grafton Close, where they molested vulnerable boys together, the court heard. McSweeney watched as a teenage boy was abused by Stingemore in the care home shower. Denial: The Catholic priest insisted he had no sexual interest in children but was found guilty by a jury . Three years earlier, McSweeney was seen ogling a Boy Scout as he washed at a retreat. When the boy reported him to a warden he was told not to be 'stupid and make trouble', and his mother slapped him because a 'priest would not do anything like that'. A schoolboy from Grafton Close told the court that McSweeney was 'touchy feely' and referred to him as a 'fat vicar'. He said that the priest went into his bedroom and told him he had to take his clothes off for a 'medical', before taking photographs of him on a Polaroid camera. Friend: John Stingemore was set to face a string of  charges alongside Sweeney but was found dead in January this year . The priest confessed to watching a porn film featuring boys as young as ten on a home cinema with Stingemore - but claimed he turned it off in disgust. And he denied molesting boys as they sat on his lap, claiming he was too fat to do so. Stingemore was sacked from Grafton Close in mysterious circumstances in 1981, and McSweeney's visits abruptly stopped as he continued with his career in the priesthood. In 1998 McSweeney nearly lost his job when his cleaner discovered his stash of sex toys, truncheons and pornographic videos at St Peter's Catholic Church in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex. She played one of the tapes and saw it featured two boys between 14 and 16 years old having sex, the court heard. McSweeney was originally told that he would be 'banished' from the priesthood, but after around six months was quietly moved to a new parish, St George's in Norwich. The defendant, who now lives in Pease Pottage, West Sussex, was told he could be jailed when he is sentenced in a month's time. Judge Alistair McCreath said: 'You are not to come to court in four weeks thinking to yourself that the judge gave me bail and therefore I'm not to go to prison, because that would be a false hope.' Responding to today's verdict, Gillian Norton of Richmond Council said: 'The council is sorry that a child in its care was indecently assaulted. 'The assault happened 35 years ago and clearly the service leadership and management laid bare in court were totally unacceptable. The situation today is completely different.' Detective Chief Inspector Keith Braithwaite of Metropolitan Police said: 'McSweeney was an abuser who used his role in a position of trust. 'I would like to pay tribute to the courage of the victim in speaking out against McSweeney. It was that testimonial that secured the charges and enabled this case to be brought to court. 'I would also like to thank those witnesses who provided key evidence that ensured the court could hear what sort of man McSweeney really is.' The Bishop of East Anglia, Alan Hopes, said that McSweeney had been barred from the ministry since his arrest and will now face disciplinary action. He said: 'These are grave crimes, and I wish to reassure firstly the victims and all of those affected that I take the matter very seriously. 'As a bishop and as an ordinary member of society, I share the experience of great sorrow and regret that such offences take place. 'The later offences of accessing indecent images of children whilst serving as a priest have both served to compound the abuse already committed on the children themselves, and breached the trust that was placed in him as a minister in the Church and those who held him in high regard. 'I wish to assure the victims and their families that their suffering is taken seriously by the Church.'","Anthony McSweeney is guilty of indecent assault and making child porn .

"A young woman got the shock of her life when a lip enhancing product she bought online left her looking like she had just gone a round in a boxing ring. Brittany Forster, 24, of Perth, Western Australia, bought CandyLipz from the company's website and tried it - sticking the apple-shaped device over her mouth and applying suction. After two 'horrific' minutes of watering eyes and painful lips, she removed the application and was appalled with the results, which had left her with a huge trout  pout. Scroll down for video . 24-year-old Perth woman, Brittany Forster (pictured left before the application) bought CandyLipz from their online website and decided to try the product out on Monday night. Brittany was left horrified with the results (right) Brittany's lips were completely unrecognisable, swollen and bruised from the lip enhancing product. The young woman, who now lives in Sydney, where she is studying for her Masters in Education, was so shocked that she began hyperventilating, worried that she would be left with permanent scarring. 'I took it off and I just looked in the mirror and I said oh my god what have I done? No, no, no, this can’t be happening,’ Brittany told Daily Mail Australia. ‘As soon as I looked in the mirror I thought what have I done to myself?.' After looking up blogs online about how Kylie Jenner got her famous lips, Brittany decided to try out CandyLipz . The application takes two minutes and makes the user's eyes and lips sting . 'I was thinking it was permanent. When I put the lipstick on, I was like, well if this is my life now I'm going to have to start enjoying it. I’ll have to embrace it.' CandyLipz is a lip plumper which can freely be bought online. According to the company's website, the effects of the product can last for up to two hours. Other lip enhancing devices, including the Jolie Lips Plumping System, De Luxe Lip Plumper, and Luscious Lips by Cynthia Rowland can also be bought on a range of sites online. Brittany posted a video online after the incident in which her two best friends are trying to comfort her by saying: ‘They’ll go down, they’ll go down, don’t worry’. But Brittany did not appreciate their comments at the time, saying 'can you see my face?' After uploading a video of the moment she unveiled her new lips to her friends on YouTube, Brittany said she now finds the situation funny, despite the fact she is left 'looking like she's been sucking on a pen all day'. The applicator for CandyLipz latches onto your lips and squeezes them, giving users a tingling sensation. 'It’s quite a painful experience,' Brittany said. CandyLipz is a lip plumper which can freely be bought online. According to the company's website, the effects of the product can last for up to two hours . Brittany was horrified with the results of the application and left worrying she would be like that forever . 'You put it on for two minutes  and it’s quite horrific and then you take it off.' However, the pain was worth it for Brittany, who had been looking at blogs on how famous Kardashian sister, Kylie Jenner, gets her massive pout, hoping to emulate the star. Kylie Jenner is now notorious for having some of the biggest lips in Hollywood and Brittany thought her secret was CandyLipz. ‘The funny thing is that when I saw Kylie Jenner's lips I thought they’re ridiculous, she’s gone too far,' Brittany said. 'But joke’s on me because that’s exactly what happened to me.’ Brittany's inspiration was Kylie Jenner, who is now famous for having a massive pout . Brittany believes the joke is now on her and that she 'should have expected it' Four days after the application, Brittany's lips are still battered and bruised. 'They're still really blue and bruised, I look dead. The next day they were still really red and quite big but now they’re just bloodied and bruised,' she said. Brittany does not blame CandyLipz for her bruised lips, claiming she knew what she was getting herself into and she said her lips will go down after a few more days. ‘In the instruction leaflet it does say all these things could happen, like bruising, swelling etc., but I just thought I was an expert on everything and used it thinking it’ll be fine, what can happen,' she said. ‘I should have just expected it.’ The traumatic experience has put the 24-year-old off ever using the product again though and she says she is now satisfied with the lips she was born with. ‘I’ll probably give it a miss. I think I've had my time with CandyLipz’, she said. CandyLipz say it is 'very normal' to get cupping marks from the product and that the bruising should resolve itself within 7 days. The company provided the following pictures which demonstrate the effects of CandyLipz . Brittany does not blame CandyLipz for her bruised lips, which she know will go down after a few more days . ‘I’m very appreciative of my little lips now. Grateful for what I have’. CandyLipz said they 'love' the video and couldn't believe how plump Brittany's lips were following the application. 'My, she got huge lips, we love it' CandyLipz told Daily Mail Australia. The company said that the swelling is a sign that the product has actually worked and it is 'normal' to get cupping marks from the applicator. 'It is very normal to get the cupping marks. These marks are temporary and will resolve within 7 days or less,' a spokesperson said. 'To have huge lips, we all went through this conditioning period. After the conditioning period, the cupping marks will not return if you continue to use the lip plumper daily.' The CandyLipz website claims that the product is suitable for 16-year-olds and older and is designed to 'raise the arches of the cupid’s bow, fills in grooves, and lip pits, lift the corners of the mouth, and block the development of duck lips.' CandyLipz said the bruising and swelling will do down in a few days .

"Clara Amfo presents the Radio 1 Top 40 chart show, which is due to be moved from a Sunday . The top 40 singles chart show is set to move from its traditional Sunday night slot. The move follows an international agreement by the music industry to release all new albums and singles on Fridays. Experts hope the new co-ordinated release date across the world will reduce piracy and 're-ignite excitement'. It comes after months of discussions between retailers, record companies, artists and musicians' unions about whether it should be changed. The Official Charts Company spokesman said it now planned to change the day the top 40 is announced. Although the new broadcast day has not yet been decided, a spokesman said BBC Radio 1 would continue to be the official home of the chart. In a statement it said: 'Exact details are to be decided, but Radio 1 will continue to be the home of the Official Chart.' A Radio 1 spokesman said a decision had yet to be made on whether the show would move or remain in its current timeslot. In the UK, singles are released on a Sunday, while albums are released the following day on a Monday. The chart show, presented by Clara Amfo, then runs between 4pm and 7pm on a Sunday. But albums and singles in other countries are released on different days, something which has led to problems across the industry. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), the global record industry body, retailers around the world 'are committed to working with the labels and artist communities to ensure the successful implementation of the move to Friday'. The IFPI said Friday releases, which will come into force this summer, would 'breathe new life into music', adding: 'It has a compelling logic, at the start of the weekend when fans most want to buy music.' Under longstanding traditions, albums are generally released on Monday in Britain and France, Tuesday in the United States, Wednesday in Japan and Friday in Australia and Germany. A number of independent retailers in the United States, the world's largest music market, had opposed the Friday release date. They argued that weekends were already the busiest time and it made sense to encourage customers to come on an otherwise slow Tuesday. In recent years, artists including Beyonce and Madonna have also suddenly released albums without warning, sometimes selling them first in digital format, either in response to leaks or sometimes to avoid them. The music industry has witnessed turmoil since albums started going digital some 15 years ago. Paul McGowan, chief executive of Hilco Capital which owns Britain's largest music retailer HMV, voiced enthusiasm about shifting to Friday releases due to the flow of shoppers (file picture) The chart show's listening figures have alone dropped from four million in the 1980s to 1.3million.

"Ohio's Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team held its postseason banquet in a hospital room in honor of their most courageous player. The 19-year-old freshman made it through a full season at the Cincinnati university while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life. During her senior year of high school, Hill was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 per cent, according to The Cure Starts Now. Scroll down for video . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19 (photographed), made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . Despite the diagnosis, Hill decided to attend college and play for the Division III school. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. Not only did she live, she played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. She's occasionally hospitalized for treatment now, but still holding to each day as tightly as she can and urging others to appreciate their time together. 'That's truly Lauren,' coach Dan Benjamin said in an interview on Thursday. 'That's the message she's been saying forever. 'She's just thankful God gave her that opportunity and that role because she's the one that could handle it. And she's done it so gracefully. 'Even at the banquet, she comes in her wheelchair and she's all smiles. And that's truly amazing. I don't know what her pain level is or how much suffering she's going through, but the girl smiles every time she gets a chance.' Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . The Team: The Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team (photographed) held its postseason banquet in a hospital room with Hill . The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 — a date that matches Hill's uniform number — but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet. Life: Doctors didn't expect Hill (center) to live this long with the tumor, which folds around parts of her brain . Doctors didn't expect Hill to live this long with the tumor, which folds around parts of her brain. 'The first diagnosis was December, around Christmas time, which is why I went ahead and tried to get the first game moved up,' Benjamin said. 'But that's Lauren. Lauren's not going to let it beat her. She's going to keep fighting. 'Everybody thought she'd be this small, tiny voice instead of this big lion roar. She's done a great job with that. And the money she's raised: Everybody thought she'd get some money, but $1.3 million is amazing.' In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Throughout her battle, Hill has been honored by several local teams and schools. Earlier this week, Hill was honored by Ohio Gov. John Kasich as a recipient of the Governor's Courage Award, according to Sports Illustrated. The freshman received and honorary doctorate from the school, Local 12 reports. The Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters has been bestowed on a few others before Hill such as Neil Armstrogn, Nick Clooney, and Bob Castellini. She was recently named chief motivational officer of The Cure Starts Now, a cancer research foundation.","Lauren Hill, 19, played a complete season with the Mount St. Joseph's team despite having an inoperable brain tumor .

"Chile's government on Thursday rejected a plea from 14-year-old Valentina Maureira (above) to be euthanized . Chile's government on Thursday rejected an ailing 14-year-old girl's plea on social media to let her 'sleep forever.' Cystic fibrosis sufferer Valentina Maureira posted a YouTube video shot from what appeared to be a hospital bed asking President Michelle Bachelet to allow her to be euthanized. It quickly circulated widely on social media. 'I urgently request to speak to the president because I'm tired of living with this illness,' said the teenager, whose older brother died at age 6 from the same disease. 'I want her approval so I can get a shot that will make me sleep forever.' Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde said Thursday that although 'it's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish,' because it's not allowed under Chilean law. Elizalde said the health ministry was in contact with Maureira's family and was providing her psychological assistance as well as medical treatment. Maureira was suffering from a respiratory illness and 'significant caloric malnutrition' when she entered Santiago's Catholic University hospital Jan. 30, said Andres Castillo, the doctor in charge of her treatment. In a statement issued by the hospital, Castillo said she had been transferred out of the critical pediatric patient unit. 'Right now our therapeutic efforts are aimed at the recovery of her nutritional state and supporting her family,' he said. Scroll down for video . Maurerira suffers from cystic fibrosis, and watched her older brother die from the disease when he was just 6-years-old . Valentina's father said she will continue trying to meet with Bachelet, so the president, who is also a pediatrician, can 'listen to her life story.' 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' said Fredy Maureira. 'I already lost a 6-year-old son because I didn't have enough money and organs. Now my daughter just wants to die in a dignified way,' he added. Maureira said that after he first heard his daughter's wish to die, he 'cried through the night.' The degenerative disease is affecting Valentina's liver, pancreas and lung, and she has said that she's frustrated by the lack of options and how much it has affected her quality of life. 'She's exhausted, we're all exhausted, but if she wants to keep fighting, I'll be by her side every second,' the father said. 'My message to all the parents in the world who have healthy kids is: Please take care of them. Love them.'","Chile's government on Thursday rejected a plea from 14-year-old Valentina Maureira to be euthanized .

"Nigel Farage has accused Ukip's political rivals of spreading 'malicious' lies that he is 'seriously ill' - and insisted he would go on-and-on leading the party. Speaking at Ukip's spring conference in Margate this afternoon, Mr Farage told activists that rumours of his demise 'have been greatly exaggerated' - but invited criticism after failing to unveil any new party policies ahead of the election. He claimed political insiders from the main Westminster parties had started rumours that he had been keeping a low profile because he was suffering a serious illness. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage has accused Ukip's political rivals of spreading 'malicious' lies that he is 'seriously ill' But Mr Farage  said the reason he had not been in the spotlight was because he was campaigning in South Thanet, the seat he hopes to win at the general election. He told delegates: 'There has been some considerable speculation as to my whereabouts. 'My absence from the Westminster scene has even led our opponents to spread some really quite malicious and unpleasant speculation about my health. 'It's said I am seriously ill and that's why I've not been seen.' Opinion polls had suggested the Ukip leader was trailing the Conservative candidate in the Kent constituency he hopes to win in May. But, to cheers in the hall, Mr Farage hailed a new poll showing he is on course to win comfortably. 'We're on our way to winning this seat,' he predicted. Mr Farage also made clear he has no intention of calling it quits any time soon. 'We are going to win lots of seats in this general election and I hope very much to be leading this party not just into this general election, but in all the elections to come.' Speaking at Ukip's spring conference in Margate this afternoon, Mr Farage told activists that rumours of his demise 'have been greatly exaggerated' The Ukip leader said he would not be quitting any time soon, adding: 'I hope very much to be leading this party not just into this general election, but in all the elections to come' Britain's sewerage system is struggling to cope with the influx of migrants, a senior Ukip figure has claimed. Immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe raised the issue as he listed elements of infrastructure that were under pressure during his speech to the party's pre-election conference. Mr Woolfe insisted the public did not care about 'colour of skin or race or creed'. 'What they are concerned about is that our eye has been taken off the ball for nearly a generation,' he told the audience in Margate. 'Schools are now full, hospitals are troubled, healthcare - it is very difficult to be seen in many areas of this country. 'Roads need to be built, we need to look at the way we feed ourselves because of our growing population. 'What about our water and sewage systems? All of these matter.' Mr Farage's address came after the Ukip conference threatened to be overshadowed by a Nazi-themed troupe of dancers which turned up in Margate this morning, dressed in hot pants, jackboots and Nazi insignia goose-stepping to 'Springtime For Hitler'. The dancers, from Mel Brooks's musical The Producers, caused the scene outside Ukip's conference venue - the Winter Gardens in Margate, Kent. A seven-strong troupe of female dancers performed a choreographed routine as Springtime For Hitler blared from a PA system on the tank turret. The cast were in Margate to promote the new touring production of the musical comedy about a failed producer who tried to put on the worst show ever. The new UK production will features stand-up comics Jason Manford, Phill Jupitus and Ross Noble – as well as TV celebrity Louie Spence. Mr Farage was given a major boost today after research was published indicating he is on track to win the nearby seat of South Thanet. The Survation survey, funded by party donor Alan Bown, put Mr Farage on 39 per cent ahead of Labour rival Will Scobie on 28 per cent when people were prompted with candidate names. A previous poll by Tory Lord Ashcroft in November had suggested the Conservatives could retain the seat - where their MP Laura Sandys is stepping down. At the party's conference today, Ukip MP Mark Reckless today warned delegates the party will not grow unless it can shake off the taint of xenophobia and demonstrate it is the 'party of the NHS'. Mr Reckless, who won a by-election in Rochester and Strood after defecting from the Tories, said voters knew Ukip wanted to leave the EU and cut immigration. But the party must 'talk about other things as well' and reassure people it is not a threat to the NHS in order to have wider appeal. Kirsten Farage, wife of Ukip leader Nigel Farage, enjoyed a glass of wine after greeting delegates at the Winter Gardens Theatre in Margate, Kent . Ukip delegates listen to a speech in the conference hall ahead of Nigel Farage's address this afternoon . Delegates were cheered by a poll showing that Nigel Farage is on course to become an MP by winning the seat of Thanet South in Kent . A leaflet produced by 'Christian Soldiers in Ukip' was being handed out to members today - accusing the gay community of a 'recruitment drive' in primary schools. 'The state is allowing the sexual grooming of our primary school children for same-sex attraction,' the leaflet said. Children were being 'indoctrinated' to 'confuse their gender identity' and 'think about and sing songs about same-sex attraction'. Mr Reckless told activists: 'There are two things most people know about us - we want to leave the European Union, and we want to cut immigration. 'We should talk about those things. But if we want to get beyond 20 per cent-30 per cent of the vote to the 40 per cent or so we will need to win constituencies, we will have to explain why we want those things, challenge some of the misconceptions there are around our party, and talk about other things as well.' Speaking in the US last night Mr Farage warned the Republican gathering that they risked becoming dinosaurs like the Conservatives in the UK if they continued to embrace the political centre. Mr Farage slammed David Cameron over his failure to identify the infamous ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John.' 'Of course they should have told us his name,' he said. 'We should have heard it weeks ago. This information's been known for a long time.' The dancers, from Mel Brooks's musical The Producers, caused the scene outside Ukip's conference venue - the Winter Gardens in Margate, Kent . Nigel Farage was upstaged this morning as dancing Nazis and a 16 tonne World War II TANK crashed UKIP's conference . He also claimed the name was leaked to cover yesterday's immigration figures. 'By sheer coincidence,' he said, Emwazi's name was published 'on the day when the government has to announce the worst immigration figures ever seen in the history of the United Kingdom.' He also hit out against CAGE, the British NGO that often advocates on behalf of radicalized Muslims and brands their detractors 'Islamophobes.' 'Yes, yes, yes!' Farage exploded when asked if the group was an embarrassment to most Britons. 'It's politcal correctness! 'I mean, we see protests on a regular basis with these groups on the streets of London saying and shouting things that – if you and I did them, we'd find ourselves behind bars in very short order.' Nigel Farage flew to Washington to address America's leading conservative conference - but hardly anyone showed up to listen . 'We actually have a Judeo-Christian culture,' he added. 'It's actually in our Constitution, so let's stand up for it. 'The thing about us 'is that we have been, of all the European countries, the most tolerant of all different religions and all different groups who have come to Britain.' While 'private observance' of any religion 'is fine,' he insisted, 'unless we live under one law we're in trouble.'","Nigel Farage accused political rivals of spreading lies about his health .

"A hippo has been making a splash in the small beach town of Ponta Do Oura in Mozambique with daily trips to the beach. The one-and-a-half ton animal has been seen trotting through the waves and going for a swim, much to the amusement of other beach-goers. 'Mr Hippo' - as he is known locally - was photographed by 44-year-old marine mammal guide, Angie Gullan who says that she has never seen anything like this before.

"An unlucky student has been banned from driving and fined £250 after he was caught just one milligramme over the drink-drive limit. Jordan Richmond, 23, drank two-thirds of a pint after driving his Seat Ibiza into a town centre to meet a friend in a pub. Nottingham Magistrates' Court heard he crashed his car on the way home after losing control in frosty conditions on December 13 last year. Richmond today admitted driving a motor vehicle when his alcohol level was above the limit during a court appearance at Nottingham Magistrates' Court (pictured) Richmond got out of the vehicle and put on his hazard lights before contacting the emergency services. But when he was later taken to hospital, a blood sample revealed he was over the drink-drive limit of 80 milligramme in 100 millilitres of blood by just one milligramme. Richmond, of Watnall, Nottinghamshire, today admitted driving a motor vehicle when his alcohol level was above the limit. JPs banned the university student from driving for 12 months and ordered him to pay a £250 in fine as well as £85 in court costs and a £25 victim surcharge. Christopher Charter, chair of the bench, said: 'It is a hard lesson, when you drive you shouldn't drink. 'Here you were over the limit, you were just over the limit, but still over the limit. It's a hard lesson for a young gentleman doing well - don't drink and drive at all.' The court heard Richmond crashed his vehicle in Long Lane in Watnall after meeting a friend for a pre-Christmas drink. Prosecutor Sanjay Jerath said the student told police he 'lost control' because conditions on the road were frosty. Chris Saunders, defending, told the court Richmond was studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Derby. He said he needed his car to get to university and to his job as a multi-skilled engineer at Boots. Mr Saunders added: 'I hate cases like this because you have one penalty that you have to impose, when that occurs some may say it leads to undue penalties for someone like Jordan Richmond. 'You know that he has been fully co-operative and called the police in the first place. 'Please offer him a driver rehabilitation course because clearly the sooner he gets his licence back the better it will be for all of us.'","Jordan Richmond crashed in icy conditions while driving home last year .

"Australians who can't afford to buy property can invest in the real estate market with as little as $66 thanks to a new start up. The recently launched BrickX allows people to buy 'bricks' or sections of properties and profit from rental returns without having to go to auction, pay stamp duty or get a mortgage. BrickX CEO Darren Patterson said the idea behind the business was to make real estate investment more straightforward and achievable. Scroll down for video . BrickX allows people to buy 'bricks' or sections of properties - such as this two-bedroom Mosman apartment . Australians who can't afford to buy property can invest in the real estate market with as little as $66 . BrickX buys properties – with a focus on one-bed studios and two-bedroom apartments in 'blue chip' suburbs – and makes them available on its online platform . 'If you've never been able to have a mortgage or save for a deposit to get your first property, this is a chance for those individuals to share in the benefits of property investment,' Mr Patterson said. BrickX buys properties – with a focus on one-bed studios and two-bedroom apartments in 'blue chip' suburbs – and makes them available on its online platform. Once an investor has registered and undergone the required financial checks, they can search through properties and can look at a detailed data profile with information including the property's rental yield, capital growth over the past five years, pictures, council rates and other attached fees. If they find a property they want to invest in, they can buy one or more 'bricks' worth up to 5 per cent of the property's total value. Each property is in an individual trust, and each 'brick' is a unit within that trust which acts like a share. 'You can buy and sell them, and it can go up or down based on the value of the property,' Mr Patterson said. BrickX CEO Darren Patterson (left, pictured with executive chairman Markus Kahlbetzer) said the idea behind the business was to make real estate investment more straightforward and achievable.

The profile includes the property's rental yield, capital growth over the past five years, pictures, council rates and other attached fees . 'You get a share of the rent minus other costs, just like a dividend you get as a stock trader on the ASX.' BrickX currently has two properties available for investment – a one-bedroom unit in Enmore in inner-city Sydney, which costs $66 for one brick, and a two-bedroom apartment with Harbour views in Mosman on Sydney's North Shore, which costs $126 per brick. But Mr Patterson is looking for properties in Melbourne and has plans to expand into more suburbs in Sydney including Bondi, Manly and areas like the Lower North Shore and the Inner West. This one bedroom unit in Enmore in inner-city Sydney costs $66 for one brick .

Each property is in an individual trust, and each 'brick' is a unit within that trust which acts like a share . Mr Patterson said he had decided to cap investments at 5 per cent to encourage liquidity. 'We limit the size to force people to spread their money around, which gives them protection through diversification,' he said. 'Secondly we've done it to encourage trading so no one person can control a property, sit on it and not allow it to go up or down.' In the initial phase of the launch only wholesale investors – people who earned $250,000 in the last two years or have $2 million worth of assets outside their family home – can invest. But Mr Patterson hopes to get registered to make BrickX available to the wider public in the next 12 months.","New start up  BrickX allows people to buy 'bricks' or sections of properties .

"David Cameron today vowed to hunt down British-raised ISIS executioner ‘Jihadi John’ and put him ‘out of action’. The Prime Minister refused to confirm that the Islamist fanatic filmed beheading hostages in Syria was the Londoner Mohammed Emwazi after he was finally identified yesterday. But Mr Cameron said the Government would do everything it could to tack down terrorists committing ‘appalling and heinous crimes’ against British citizens anywhere in the world. Scroll down for video . David Cameron said the Government would do everything it could to tack down terrorists committing ‘appalling and heinous crimes’ against British citizens anywhere in the world . The PM also hit back at criticism of the security services in the wake of yesterday’s unmasking of Emwazi, amid revelations that he had been on MI5’s radar for years. He said the security services did ‘extraordinary’ work to keep Britain safe – and revealed they had even foiled a terror plot ‘in the last few months’. Kuwaiti-born Emwazi moved to Britain as a six-year-old child – and quickly embraced British life, playing football in the affluent streets of West London while supporting Manchester United. Neighbours recalled a polite, quietly spoken boy who was studious at his Church of England school, where he was the only Muslim pupil in his class. After finishing primary school in 1999, Emwazi moved to Quintin Kynaston Community Academy, in St John’s Wood, where he is believed to have studied alongside former X Factor judge and pop star Tulisa Contostavlos . Once there, he became more observant of his religion and began wearing more traditional Islamic dress, and his sisters began to wear the hijab. Speaking in Wales, alongside the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Mr Cameron launched an impassioned defence of the security services . In August 2009, after his graduation, Emwazi flew to Tanzania where they were picked up by MI5 – who accused him of planning to travel to Somalia to join the militant group Al Shabaab. Mr Cameron today refused to name Enwazi but said: ‘When there are people anywhere in the world who commit appalling and heinous crimes against British citizens we will do everything we can with the police with the security services with all that we have at our disposal to find these people and put them out of action.’ The PM said this was his ‘number one priority’. Speaking in Wales, alongside the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Mr Cameron also launched an impassioned defence of the security services. But he suggested the House of Commons Security and Intelligence Committee could review MI5’s failure to stop Enwazi travelling to Syria to join ISIS. Mr Cameron said: ‘I work very closely with our security services. I meet with them regularly, I ask them searching questions about that they do – and in my almost five years of experience as Prime Minister I think they are incredibly impressive, hardworking, dedicated, courageous and affective at protecting our country. ‘All of the time they are having to make incredibly difficult judgements and I think basically they make very good judgements on our behalf. ‘While we are in the middle of this vast effort to make sure British citizens are sage, the most important thing is to get behind them.’ The ISIS executioner Jihadi John was finally identified as Londoner Mohammed Emwazi yesterday . Mohammed Emwazi pictured at St Marys School, first row, second from left, after moving to Britain from Kuwait . But the Prime Minister said there were ‘proper ways of calling security and intelligence services to account’ where there were concerns – and pointed to the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee. However, he added: ‘I am satisfied we have in place the right ways of scrutinising the work these extraordinary men and women do on our behalf. ‘All I can say is even in the last few months their dedication and work has saved us from plots on the streets of the United Kingdom that could’ve done immense damage, so it is a moment to stand up and thank them for the work they do on our behalf.’","PM refused to confirm ISIS fanatic is Londoner Mohammed Emwazi .

"Four people have been charged with murdering an albino woman in Tanzania and cutting off her legs and an arm for black magic rituals. Zawadi Magindu was killed at Nyamalulu village in the north western Geita region of the African country in November 2008. The four people accused of killing the 22-year-old have pleaded not guilty with a hearing set to continue next week. The trial is the first of its kind to be held in the Geita region where six albinos were killed and three wounded between 2007 and 2012, according to police data (file picture) Public prosecutor Ezron Mwasimba said: 'We have gathered compelling evidence against the accused persons including from members of the bereaved family who had identified them.' The trial is the first of its kind to be held in the Geita region where six albinos were killed and three wounded between 2007 and 2012, according to police data. The charges come as members of Tanzania's albino society prepare to hold nationwide protests next week to call on the government to take more action to stop such attacks. There are fears of more murders ahead of an election later this year because of the risk that some politicians could turn to witchcraft to improve their chances. The demonstrations have been triggered by the abduction and suspected murder of two albino children in the past two months. One-year-old Yohana Bahati was snatched by armed men from his home in the northwestern Geita region earlier this month and his body found days later with his limbs severed. A four-year-old albino girl was abducted in December by an armed gang from her home at Ndami village in Mwanza region. She is still missing but 14 people have now been arrested. Albino children at a recreational hall in Mwanza, Tanzania, on January 25, 2009 ©Tony Karumba (AFP/File) At least 75 albinos, who lack pigment in their skin, hair and eyes, have been murdered in Tanzania in the past 15 years, according to U.N. figures, many hacked to death and body parts removed to make spells that witch doctors claim bring good luck. Witch doctors will pay as much as £50,000 for a full set of body parts from an albino, according to a Red Cross report. Albinos face attack in many parts of Africa, but kidnappings, attacks and killings are more common in Tanzania and the government last month announced a nationwide ban on witch doctors to try to stem the violence. United Nations human rights officials have voiced concerns that despite the number of murders, trials are rare with only five successful prosecutions since 2000. The Tanzania Albino Society called on the government to speed up prosecutions. 'We would like to see those who are convicted for murdering people with albinism hanged to deter others from carrying out such acts, but that is not happening,' said the group's chairman Ernest Kimanya. Albinism is a congenital disorder which affects about one in 20,000 people worldwide, according to medical authorities. It is more common in sub-Saharan Africa and affects an estimated one Tanzanian in 1,400.","Zawadi Magindu was murdered in Geita region of Tanzania six years ago .

"A judge has ordered the suspension of the globally popular instant messaging system WhatsApp across Brazil. He said it's because it has allegedly failed to help in an investigation and though he wouldn't comment on details because it's an on-going case, it's believed to be one that's looking into child porn appearing on the app. Judge Luiz de Moura Correia ordered the suspension earlier this month. A press officer at the Piaui state's Public Safety Department says the case is linked to 'sexually graphic photos of children on the app.' A judge says he has ordered the suspension of the globally popular instant messaging system WhatsApp across Brazil because it has allegedly failed to help in an investigation . The service has continued to operate normally, with newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reporting that this is because lawyers are appealing the ruling. WhatsApp does not have an office in Brazil so the judge's order was delivered to cellphone operators. SindiTelebrasil, the association that represents those operators, said on its website that the suspension could cause 'huge losses to millions of Brazilians' who use WhatsApp for personal and professional reasons. WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment. WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, which last year paid nearly $22billion to acquire the mobile messaging service. Earlier this year Prime Minister David Cameron threatened to block WhatsApp to prevent terrorists from plotting atrocities online. In a challenge to critics of the so-called snoopers’ charter, he said fanatics should not be able to talk to each other without security agencies listening in. WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, which last year paid nearly $22billion to acquire the mobile messaging service . Making an electoral campaign speech in Nottingham in January, Mr Cameron indicated he would revive monitoring legislation – blocked by the Liberal Democrats – if he secures a majority in May. ‘The attacks in Paris once again demonstrated the need to have robust powers through our intelligence and security agencies to keep our people safe,’ he said. ‘The powers that I believe we need, whether on communications data or on the content of communications, I am very comfortable that those are absolutely right for a modern, liberal democracy. ‘If I am Prime Minister, I will make sure we do not allow terrorists safe space to communicate with each other.’ The Prime Minister also added that he would stop the use of methods of communication, which cannot be read by the security services such as WhatsApp and Snapchat, due to data being encrypted. He explained: 'Are we going to allow a means of communications which it simply isn’t possible to read? 'My answer to that question is: ‘No, we must not.'","Judge Luiz de Moura Correia ordered the suspension earlier this month .

"Conservative darling Sarah Palin said Thursday that President Barack Obama needs to wake up and realize that the United States and the 'genocidal thugs' affiliated with ISIS can never coexist. Referencing Obama's remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast the first week in February, during which he said Christians need to get off their 'high horse' when it comes to critiquing Islam, Palin told a group of conservatives that lectures like the president's 'won't stop the Islamists from killing the Christians.' 'While Christians bow our head to pray for you, radical Islamists want to cut off your head,' she said of the president. Scroll down for video . Former Alaska Gov.

It's the United States military' Palin dedicated most of her speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, held a few miles outside of Washington, D.C., at a hotel in Maryland, to praising veterans and their service to the country. 'Aside from God almighty,' she said, the only force that can keep 'barbaric' terrorists at bay and 'the only thing standing between us and savages is the red white and blue. It's the United States military.' Admonishing the Obama administration, Clinton said the U.S. is in a 'long-term, civilization struggle against the forces of evil.' And 'if we intend to beat them, we better get serious about victory,' she said. 'In the past our leaders confronted evil with moral clarity, eliminating Facists and the Nazis' as well as Communists, she said. 'Make no mistake radical Islam is just as dangerous as those ideologies.' Palin mocked Obama for continuing to 'lead from behind' even after Islamic extremists threatened to cut off his head in the White House. 'He thinks the Islamic state isn't really Islamic,' she said, incredulously. Obama has acknowledged that terrorists who are a part of ISIS and al Qaeda are Islamic, but he and his administration have steadfastly argued that referring to them in that context merely justifies their hateful ideology. 'Pretending its not there doesn't make it go away,' though, Palin told conservatives on Thursday. 'Calling it something else wont make it so.' The world that they want is a world that will submit. We will never submit to evil,' she said to cheers from the audience. Palin said Obama's State Department is 'naive' to say that the U.S. can't kill its way out of war, as spokesperson Marie Harf, last week claimed. 'Really? Tell that to the Nazis,' she said.

"Hugh Jackman and his schoolmates are genuinely shocked, saddened and longing for justice as revelations emerge about rampant child sex abuse at their former school. That's according to Triple M radio presenter Gus Worland, who attended the prestigious Knox Preparatory and Senior Schools on Sydney's north shore with his lifelong friend from 1978 to 1986. The Royal Commission into Child Sex Abuse has this week heard shocking evidence about the alleged paedophilia of teachers at the school between the 1970 and 2012. Among the disturbing stories aired at the commission this week include how a paedophile teacher was commemorated on a memorial with the inscription, 'he touched us all', and how a former teacher was suspected of hiding under a boy's bed and then touching him inappropriately.

'None of my mates were affected I think because we perceived to be strong. They seemed to prey on the weaker guys'. Worland and Jackman are very interested in the testimony of Dr Ian Paterson, who was the school's headmaster from 1969 to 1998, most of the period under investigation. The commission has heard from counsel of the commission David Llyod that Dr Paterson was aware of sexual abuse allegations but that there was no evidence NSW police were contacted about the incident. 'We are all dotted around the world just trying to work it all out and of course waiting for the Dr Paterson evidence,' Worland said. 'We all respected Dr P so much and were scared of him too.

The commission heard evidence from a former boarding house master on Thursday, Dr Timothy Hawkes, who said he reported the 'balaclava man' incident to Dr Paterson but not to police. According to the ABC, Dr Hawkes, now the headmaster of The King's School in Parramatta, in Sydney's west, told the commission: 'I didn't believe it was my place to do that. 'I had every confidence that the matter would be dealt with by a very experienced headmaster. 'There was absolutely no question in my mind that I fully expected the police to be notified because it was a serious offence. 'And I was desperate to make sure that this person was caught because I did not want that happening again to any of my boys.' Worland commented on the matter on Triple M this morning. 'He was my geography teacher,' he said. 'If he knows a balaclava'd man has been hiding under the beds of kids in his boarding house, he then takes it to his boss, I totally understand (that),' he said. 'Where's the moral obligation to then check up the next day and check, by the way boss, you have taken it to the authorities right?' The commission continues. Daily Mail Australia has approached Hugh Jackman's representative for comment on the proceedings. The child abuse royal commission has issued a warrant for the arrest of a former teacher at Sydney's Knox Grammar school who failed to turn up for a hearing. Christopher Fotis was due to give evidence on Tuesday but did not show up. On Thursday David Lloyd, counsel advising the commission, said police were searching for Fotis and if he was found he would be brought to the commission. Fotis was never charged with offences at Knox but was jailed in Melbourne for sexual abuse offences at a school there after his time at Knox, in Wahroonga on Sydney's north shore. The inquiry into the NSW private boys' school is focusing on an incident in 1988 at one of the boarding houses, MacNeil House, when a person wearing a Knox tracksuit and balaclava hid under a child's bed and sexually assaulted him. Mr Lloyd said although the person's face was concealed by the balaclava a number of the boys in the dormitory believed the offender was Fotis. The boys were later told police arrested the intruder - ""an Asian man"" - but the commission has found no evidence that police were ever informed of an intruder or a sexual assault. Fotis left MacNeil shortly after the incident and resigned from Knox a year later when he was found by police masturbating in his car outside a school in Melbourne. via Australian Associated Press .

"A multimillionaire businessman has been slammed by a judge for his refusal to pay his estranged wife a penny in a bitter divorce battle. Randy Work, a former key executive in Texas-based private equity company Lone Star, was told by Mr Justice Holman at the Family Division of London's High Court today: 'I am not sure you and I are on the same planet'. Mr Work, 47, was explaining to the judge why he was arguing in court that his estranged wife was only entitled to £5m despite the fact he has a huge fortune of at least £150m. Mandy Gray (left), and her estranged husband Randy Work (right), outside the High Court in London today. The judge in their divorce case said he did not feel he and Mr Work were 'on the same planet' The tycoon said that 'unfortunately' the mother of his two teenage children, Mandy Gray, 45, had failed to abide by a Texan post-nuptial agreement. She was therefore prevented from receiving a more substantial sum, or anything other than the £5m deemed to be her own separate property, an amount expected to fall to just over £3m when bills are paid. Justice Holman told the couple there was 'plenty of money to go around and it 'should be so easy' From the opening of the case Justice Holman urged the couple - who had 'married without a bean' - to settle their differences. The judge told them as they sat on opposite sides of the courtroom there was 'plenty of money to go round', there were no difficulties and it 'should be so easy'. He added: 'People who are struggling to afford two-bedroom houses have difficulties.' The couple began living together in 1992 and married in 1995 in California. They separated in 2013 and have two children, now aged 15 and 12. The court was told that Randy was 'the breadwinner' and Mandy 'the homemaker'. In 1997 he was offered a job with Lone Star in Dallas, Texas, and soon after he was offered a post in Tokyo, where they lived from 1998 until 2005. The couple moved to the UK in 2008 and their matrimonial home has been in London ever since. After the marriage broke down Mandy moved to a flat in Kensington. In the witness box Mr Work described how he had gone to Japan and made billions of dollars for Lone Star buying up real estate, including troubled golf courses, after the Japanese economy became stuck in a sharp downturn. Mandy Gray, 45, arrives back at the Royal Courts of Justice building following lunch, with her lawyer Fiona Shackleton (right). She is taking on her estranged husband Randy Work in a bitter battle over his fortune . Mr Work told the judge that Mandy had been 'a good wife' over 20 years and 'a good mother' and would have been entitled to at least $70m (£45m), the 'total sum payable' under the post-nup agreement they had signed in October 2000. But he argued Ms Gray was not entitled to any of his money, or any of his property, after coming to court to seek a better settlement. Ms Gray argued when she gave evidence that Clause V of the addendum agreement gave her 'the unfettered right' to seek from the court 'any form of financial provision the court has power to order'. Randy Work leaves court today. He made his fortune with a Texas private equity company . She argued the family wealth was generated during the marriage and there should now be an equal division of the current total net assets. The judge told Charles Howard QC, appearing for Mr Work that he was 'really concerned' about the husband's 'open' position that he was 'not going to pay her a penny'. The judge expressed his disbelief that 'a wife of roughly 20 years, married when neither had a bean, and he is now worth at least £150m, should be expected to go away with just over £3m'. He added: 'At the moment I am not sure Mr Work and I are on the same planet.' Mr Howard did not disagree that that was Mr Work's position in court, but he suggested to the judge that he was 'trespassing into negotiations' that might be taking place out of court. The judge replied: 'No I am not. I don't know how many times I have said the focus should be on negotiation.' He said he had no doubt that Mr Work 'would like to close this down' and had probably got more money on the table outside court, but he was maintaining an open position 'where he and I are not on the same planet'. The court heard how both Randy and Mandy were born in the US but had 'expatriated' and both are now resident in London. Ms Gray told the court that the post-nup was part of the move to separate their assets when her husband first decided to give up his US citizenship to save tax in America. Mr Work denied that was true.","American Randy Work, 47, slammed by judge at the High Court in London .

"Sir Cliff Richard's lawyers criticised a House of Commons committee for publishing a letter revealing details of the police investigation into sex abuse claims against the singer (pictured) Sir Cliff Richard's lawyers have criticised a House of Commons committee for publishing a letter about the police investigation into sex abuse allegations against the veteran singer. In a letter to MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, the star's representatives said the disclosure was 'unnecessary' and caused him 'a further round of unnecessary and extremely damaging media coverage with no due process'. Earlier this week, a letter from South Yorkshire's chief constable emerged in which he said the police investigation into the singer has 'increased significantly in size' and involves 'more than one allegation'. Mr Vaz has since defended the decision, saying it is 'policy' to make all committee evidence public. The letter from Gideon Benaim, of Michael Simkins LLP, said: 'Plainly, it was not necessary for the SYP letter to be published on any urgent basis, if at all. 'The SYP letter appears to have been in the hands of the committee for a period of two weeks or more before it was proactively sent to media organisations, presumably to encourage widespread publicity. 'There was ample time to properly consider whether the SYP letter ought to have been released before it actually was. 'As a direct result of the decision of the committee to publish the SYP letter, and to proactively send it to media organisations, our client has been exposed to a further round of unnecessary and extremely damaging media coverage, with no due process.' Mr Benaim continued: 'Our client had no opportunity to comment or make submissions to the committee in advance of publication, but had he been able to do so, the damage that has since been caused by the Committee's actions and by the SYP letter would, most likely, have been avoided. Scroll down for video . In a letter to MP Keith Vaz (pictured) chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, the singer's representatives said the disclosure was 'unnecessary' 'It is the committee who have acted as enablers to the media so that they could report on claims of new allegations about which our client has been given no or very little information; about which he has yet to be questioned; for which he has not been arrested; and of course, over which he has not been charged. 'The committee have, through their actions, facilitated coverage which would not have otherwise occurred.' Stressing the fact that his client has not been arrested or charged with any offence and denies any wrongdoing whatsoever, Mr Benaim issued a strongly worded critique of this week's developments. He also rebuked Mr Vaz for media appearances over the issue. Mr Benaim wrote: 'It does of course remain the case that our client has neither been arrested nor charged with any offence and that he denies any wrongdoing whatsoever. 'In addition to not knowing much about the claims of new allegations, our client has not of course been interviewed about them. 'Extensive media interest was hardly dampened by the chairman of the committee who appeared on television to discuss the contents of the SYP Letter on the same evening of its release. 'It is manifestly unfair to our client that he has again been put in a situation where speculation and rumours are rife, where he cannot defend himself because he is the subject of an investigation, and, where third parties appear to know more than he does. 'It is not how a criminal investigation should be conducted.' Mr Benaim said it was understood that the letter from South Yorkshire Police was 'proactively' sent to media organisations by the committee without notice being given to Sir Cliff or his lawyers. It also described the original letter from the police force as 'poorly worded' and 'at certain points unnecessarily emotive', while including a 'number of significant points which could be misinterpreted'. Sir Cliff's lawyers said the police's letter 'has the appearance of being written without the level of care and attention that such an important communication demands' and disputed some of its contents. Mr Benaim said the singer has not been actively updated with 'substantive information' relating to the investigation, claiming that 'in the main' it is his solicitors, BCL, who have contacted South Yorkshire Police for updates. The letter added: 'That said, SYP and BCL have co-operated on several aspects of the investigation, for which our client has been grateful. 'He remains very keen to co-operate fully and for the investigation to be resolved swiftly.' Mr Benaim said Sir Cliff has been kept 'fully briefed' on conversations between his lawyers and South Yorkshire Police. Earlier this week, a letter from South Yorkshire's chief constable David Crompton (pictured) emerged in which he said the police investigation into the singer has 'increased significantly in size' The letter addressed the police's disclosure that there is 'more than one allegation', saying the 'information that has been provided to our client about the new allegations is so scarce it is difficult to comment meaningfully'. It went on: 'Late on Friday 6 February, BCL telephoned one of the lead officers on the investigation. During the course of that call, the officer told BCL that there was now more than one complaint (albeit a small number). Very little substantive detail was disclosed.' It also questioned the claim that the investigation has 'increased significantly', saying: 'This phrasing is curious and seems to us to be - at best - a loose use of language and at worst to be unnecessarily emotive. 'In the current climate, the phraseology deployed was likely to lead both readers and members of the press to jump to exaggerated conclusions, as indeed it has.' The letter called on Mr Vaz to take a number of actions in response to their concerns, concluding: 'In light of the damage that has been caused by the actions of SYP and the committee, we are taking the proactive step of making this letter publicly available straightaway, rather than waiting for it to appear on the committee's website at some uncertain date in the future.' Sir Cliff said the claims against him were 'absurd and untrue' and insisted he had 'never, in my life, assaulted anyone'. The entertainer was interviewed under caution last year by detectives investigating a claim of a sex crime involving a young boy in the 1980s, but was not arrested or charged.","Earlier this week, a letter from South Yorkshire's chief constable revealed police investigation into the singer has 'increased significantly in size'

"RAF Typhoon fighters were scrambled to intercept 'multiple Russian aircraft' as part of the Nato mission to police the airspace over the Baltics, the Ministry of Defence said yesterday. The aircraft from 3 (Fighter) Squadron were ordered into the skies after four separate groups of aircraft were detected by Nato air defences in international airspace near to the Baltic states. The aircraft were subsequently identified as a Russian Tupolev Tu22 Backfire bomber, four Sukhoi Su27 Flanker fighters, one Beriev A50 Mainstay early-warning aircraft and an Antonov An26 Curl transport aircraft.

The MoD said the Russian aircraft, which appeared to be carrying out a 'variety of routine training', were monitored by the Typhoons and escorted on their way. Four Typhoons - which are now stationed at the Siauliai air base in Lithuania - were deployed to the region last month in a show of support by Nato against the backdrop of the crisis in the Ukraine. Russia’s backing for armed separatists in the Ukraine had increased nervousness in the three Baltic states of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia which do not have their own air defence fighters and rely upon Nato. In the past week, Nato aircraft have been scrambled 13 times due to unidentified aircraft operating around the Baltic region. The Russian Beriev A50 Mainstay early warning aircraft.

The interception was the sixth to have been carried out by the British aircraft since their arrival from their home base in at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, in support of the Polish-led Nato detachment in Lithuania. The Typhoon detachment commander, Wing Commander Ian Townsend said: 'We regularly intercept Russian and civilian aircraft from UK Quick Reaction Alert and so this type of mission is core business for us and exactly what we were sent to the Baltic region by Nato to do. 'It was a thoroughly successful operation with both my ground crew and aircrew performing to the exacting professional high standards I have come to expect.'

Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks with Head of Rossiya Agricultural Production Cooperative Sergei Pyanov as they walk in a barley field outside Stavropol . The RAF scramble came as the Ukrainian president announced a plan to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine, promising a unilateral cease-fire after discussions with the Russian and German leaders, a potential major development to bring peace to the country. Petro Poroshenko’s plan would offer pro-Russian insurgents in the eastern provinces that form the nation’s industrial heartland a chance to lay down weapons or leave the country.

"Three British Muslims were accused yesterday of plotting a suicide bomb attack designed to wreak more devastation than the July 7 attacks. The Al Qaeda-inspired trio masterminded a conspiracy to detonate eight home-made rucksack devices, a court was told. They bragged how the attacks would have caused ‘mass deaths’ in crowded areas. One of the men was secretly recorded saying the 2005 London attacks had ‘gone a bit wrong’ because the killers forgot to put nails in their bombs. From left to right, Irfan Naseer, 31, Irfan Khalid and Ashik Ali, both 27, who are accused of being 'central figures' in the extremist plot to cause mass deaths and casualties . They also discussed mass poisoning and fixing blades to the wheels of a vehicle before driving it into a crowd of people, and boasted their plot would be ‘another 9/11’. The trio raised thousands of pounds to fund the plot by posing as street collectors for the humanitarian charity Muslim Aid, the jury was told. Two of the men are alleged to have travelled to Pakistan to attend a terrorist camp and received training with explosives, weapons and poisons. They are said to have recorded ‘martyrdom videos’ explaining their actions which were to be released to the media after their deaths. On their return to Birmingham, they set up a bomb factory in a council flat and began recruiting a team of accomplices. The jihadist plot was smashed by counter-terrorism police and MI5, who had the cell under intensive surveillance, bugging the men’s cars and the bomb factory. Eleven men and one woman were arrested when officers swooped on addresses across Birmingham in September last year. Opening the case amid high security at Woolwich Crown Court, prosecutor Brian Altman QC said those on trial were ‘senior members of a home-grown terror cell’. The trio were arrested by police after covert probes caught them talking about their plot as they were heating chemicals in Ali's home . He said: ‘The police successfully disrupted a plan to commit an act or acts of terrorism on a scale potentially greater than the London bombings in July 2005. The defendants were proposing to detonate up to eight rucksack bombs in a suicide attack and/or to detonate bombs on timers in crowded areas in order to cause mass deaths and casualties. ‘One of them was even to describe their plan as “another 9/11”.’ Two of the men – unemployed graduate Irfan Naseer, 31, and former security guard Irfan Khalid, 27 – are accused of twice travelling to terrorist camps in Pakistan. They spent 15 months learning how to make bombs, use weapons and create poisons ‘for the sole purpose’ of bringing their knowledge to Britain and using it, the court heard. When they returned in July 2011, they teamed up with Ashik Ali, 27, whose ground-floor flat was transformed into a safe house to experiment with explosive chemicals. The court heard Naseer was recorded agreeing with another man that July 7 had ‘gone a bit wrong’ because the bombers did not use nails. Naseer, a heavily-built man known as ‘Chubbs’, used knowledge from his pharmacy degree to mix the chemicals. He bought an instant cold pack, in the mistaken belief it contained ammonium nitrate. The men were recorded talking about training with AK-47 assault rifles and grenades as well as firing a rocket launcher and the vehicle blade plot, which was in the Al Qaeda magazine, Inspire. Partially-sighted Ali, a former charity manager, obtained the flat with the help of a blind charity. Woolwich Crown Court heard how the gang tried to raise further funds by gambling the cash they raised from their bogus charity collections through a currency trading company . But he was recorded telling his estranged wife he was going abroad to fight jihad, and comparing himself and others to Four Lions, a film about bungling British extremists. After he was arrested, Ali confessed that his role was to wear a suicide vest and carry a gun, but he denied he would have carried out the attack, it was alleged. The terrorist cell was allegedly inspired by internet videos and the writings of Osama Bin Laden and US-born Yemeni extremist Anwar Al-Awlaki, who was killed in a drone strike 12 days after the suspects were arrested. Ali's estranged wife, Salma Kabal, 23, pictured, is accused of knowing . of her husband's terrorist intentions but failing to disclose them . The men raised £14,500 by impersonating street collectors for a charity and an Islamic learning centre, the jury heard. But Rahin Ahmed, 26, a conspirator who has admitted terrorist offences, lost £9,000 gambling on the currency markets. The court heard the law graduate was the gang’s ‘chief financier’ but was ostracised after his trading spree. The men wanted to spend the money on setting up a high-street Islamic centre which would serve as a front for terrorist recruitment. All three are also accused of radicalising and recruiting other young Muslim men to their extremist cause. All of those allegedly involved in the plot are of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin and from the Sparkhill, Sparkbrook, Balsall Heath and Alum Rock areas of Birmingham. The jury was told about others linked to the plot, including several men who have admitted involvement and are awaiting sentence. They included Ahmed and Mujahid Hussain, 21, who pleaded guilty to helping collect money for terrorism. Four men – Ishaaq Hussain, 20, Naweed Ali, 24, Khobaib Hussain, 20, and Shahid Khan, 20 – have admitted flying to Pakistan for terrorist training in August 2011. But they returned before joining the camp after one of their families learned of their plans. Two others – Ashik Ali’s brother Bahader, 29, and Mohammed Rizwan, 33 – will go on trial next year accused of terrorist offences. Ali’s estranged wife, Salma Kabal, 23, will also go on trial next year, accused of failing to inform the authorities of her knowledge of the plot. Naseer, Khalid and Ali deny preparing terrorist acts, including plotting a bomb attack, recruiting others and sending people aboard for training. The trial, which is expected to last three months, continues.

"Human rights group CAGE has come under further scrutiny for the support it gives to a number of convicted terrorists, including radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza (pictured) The campaign group that described ISIS executioner Jihadi John as a 'beautiful young man' came under scrutiny today as it was revealed British charities are funding them to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Human rights group CAGE sparked fury yesterday when its leader Asim Qureshi claimed west London student Mohammed Emwazi 'wouldn't hurt a fly'. Today, it was revealed CAGE supports a number of convicted terrorists and other jihadis who remain at large - while collecting donations from some well-known British trusts. The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust has donated more than £300,000 to the group, and The Roddick Foundation - which distributes part of Body Shop founder Anita Roddick's fortune - has donated £100,000. Critics have alleged that CAGE is an extremist organisation that promotes a radical Islamist narrative and have questioned whether it could have done more to prevent Emwazi travelling to Syria. Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg, who was charged with terror offences, founded the Islamic rights group. Other individuals that CAGE offer support to include radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza and Aafia Siddiqui - dubbed 'Lady al Qaeda'. It was also revealed today that CAGE had its accounts with Barclays and the Co-operative Bank – and those of several of its board members – closed several weeks after Moazzam Begg was arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences. The Joseph Rowntree  Charitable Trust handed the group a £300,000 donation in January 2014. A spokesman for the trust said: 'As a Quaker trust, we reject and condemn all violence, including all violence for political ends. We believe that building sustainable security requires patient, long-term work to address the underlying causes of conflict and injustice. 'Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust has previously funded CAGE to promote and protect human rights. We believe that they have played an important role in highlighting the ongoing abuses at Guantanamo Bay and at many other sites around the world, including many instances of torture. 'The Trust does not necessarily agree with every action or statement of any group that we have funded. 'We believe that CAGE is asking legitimate questions about security service contact with those who have gone on to commit high-profile and horrific acts of violence, but this does not in any way absolve any such individual from responsibility for such criminal acts.' CAGE and The Roddick Foundation were both approached by MailOnline for comment, but have yet to reply. CAGE described ISIS executioner Jihadi John as a 'beautiful young man' who wouldn't hurt a fly. The killer is pictured with murdered British aid worker David Haines . The group is particularly animated about the case of Aafia Siddiqui - dubbed 'Lady al Qaeda' - who was jailed for 86 years in the US for attempting to murder US officials in Afghanistan. She had wide-ranging links to al-Qaeda and was married to a key plotter behind the 9/11 attacks. But CAGE said it has 'dedicated itself to campaigning for Aafia and her family in order to help secure their release and expose those involved in their abuse.' The group also represented the family of Michael Adebolajo - the man who butchered Lee Rigby in a London street in May 2013. CAGE revealed that Adebolajo had been harassed by the security services prior to his violent murder on the streets of Woolwich, south-east London. The group is animated about the case of Aafia Siddiqui (both) dubbed Lady al Qaeda, who was jailed for 86 years in the US for attempting to murder US officials in Afghanistan . The campaign group also defended radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri who was sentenced to life in prison by a court in New York for supporting terrorism. He was convicted in May 2014 of multiple charges, including hostage-taking and plotting to set up a terrorism training camp in the US. But CAGE called for him to be repatriated to Britain after the handless  suspect appeared before a judge without the false limbs and complained  that he wanted them back. At the time, Mr Qureshi said: 'We would want to see him, if convicted, serving any sentence in the UK, particularly when you consider the kind of treatment detainees face in US prisons.' Aafia Siddiqui had wide-ranging links to al-Qaeda and was married to a key plotter behind the 9/11 attacks . Asim Qureshi, leader of CAGE, who helped to name Jihadi John as west London student Mohammed Emwazi, caused outrage yesterday by saying the ISIS militant 'wouldn't hurt a fly' Others that CAGE support include Nizar Trabelsi who was convicted in Belgium as part of an al-Qaeda plot to carry out a suicide attack against a military base holding US soldiers. This comes to light as CAGE representative Cerie Bullivant today told Good Morning Britain he believes the British security forces played a role in radicalising Jihadi John. 'He came to us after he felt he was being harassed by the security services; he felt there was pressure being put on him and he couldn't carry on with his ordinary life,' Mr Bullivant said. 'We advised him on methods he could take if he was innocent to clear his name, we advised him to go to his MP, the IPCC - he was very, very willing to engage with the system to try and get his name cleared. He sent letters to the embassies as to why he was being barred, he tried as much as he could to work through the system.' The Islamic rights group was founded by former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg (pictured), who was charged with terror offences . 'But the problem is you've got a detached unaccountable security apparatus and there was no clear was for him to engage with that process and the lack of due process we think played a role in radicalising him.' Anti-radicalisation organisation the Quilliam Foundation questioned whether the organisation could have done more to prevent Emwazi travelling to Syria. 'They seem to have had a relationship with him for three years - since before he went to Syria - and I simply don't believe that nothing could have been done in that process to stop him,' chief political liaison officer Jonathan Russell told the Evening Standard. 'It's very, very important to uphold human rights in counter-extremism work, but for an organisation like CAGE to focus entirely on grievances and allow those to be extrapolated in a radicalisation process is surely part of the problem and not part of the solution.' CAGE has also supported Sajid Badat, who was sentenced to 13 years in 2005 after confessing  to being part of the plot to blow up an aircraft with a shoe-bomb. It has also backed Andrew Rowe, the convert also given 13 years for acts preparatory to terrorism. The CAGE website demands solidarity for several jihadis who have been both tried and convicted, and for many more who are at large. It also supported Anwar al-Awlaki, who called for the killing of the Danish cartoonist, Kurt Westergaard. Awlaki, who was killed by an American drone in September 2011, is thought to have inspired the Charlie Hebdo attacks. The group also represented the family of Michael Adebolajo (pictured) - the man who butchered Lee Rigby in a London street in May 2013 . CAGE representative Cerie Bullivant (pictured) today told Good Morning Britain he believes the British security forces played a role in radicalising Jihadi John . The Islamic-focused human rights group lodged a formal complaint with the financial ombudsman last year after spending five months on a cash-only basis. It was one of a number of Muslim pressure groups and charities to have had their accounts withdrawn by various banks. On the campaign group's website, it says: 'CAGE has been campaigning against the War on Terror for more than a decade. 'Its work has focussed on working with survivors of abuse and mistreatment across the globe. Its website is one of the leading resources documenting the abuse of due process and the erosion of the rule of law in the context of the War on Terror.'

"Britain has demanded Brussels launch surprise inspections in Gibraltar of Spanish border checks in a fresh escalation of tensions between London and Madrid. Ministers want the European Commission to make unannounced visits to assess the legality of border checks which have been blamed for long queues to enter and leave the Rock. The row has been simmering since last summer when Spain suggested a £43.50 fee could be imposed on anyone wanting to cross the border with the British territory. Scroll down for video . Motorists have been forced to queue at the border crossing between Spain and Gibraltar over the last year, leading ministers to ask for new inspections by European Commission officials . Visitor numbers to Gibraltar have fallen as a result of the hold-ups, which Madrid argues are needed to prevent smuggling across the border. In November, European Commission inspectors found the checks were within the law and said Britain should work with Spain to bring down tobacco smuggling and other border crime. However, the Foreign Office has raised doubts about the report because it was based on inspections agreed in advance with the Spanish authorities. With the draconian checks still causing ’significant’ delays and hitting the local economy, European officials are being urged to travel to the border without giving Madrid prior warning. ‘We want them to go back and carry out more inspections but without arranging it in advance,’ said a government source. There is also growing anger in Whitehall over Spanish ships making incursions into Gibraltan waters. The number of unlawful incidents doubled from 229 in 2012 to 496 in 2013. Figures released in response to a parliamentary question show the number of incursions into Gibraltan waters has more than doubled in a year . Already this year from January to May there have been 185 incursions, latest figures show. As a result the Spanish Ambassador has been summoned three times to explain the aggression, most recently on April 2 this year. Earlier this year a Spanish warship had to be escorted off British territory by Gibraltar Squadron's patrol boat, HMS Sabre, after it entered the waters near Gibraltar. Europe minister David Lidington is expected to travel to Gibraltar within the next month to discuss the problem . The boat allegedly used a fake name and call sign, and refused to leave by its own accord at it claimed it was in Spanish waters, local media said. The vessel approached as UK Special Forces personnel from the Royal Navy's Submarine Parachute Assistance Group were carrying out training jumps into the sea. Government insiders suspect that the Spanish aggression towards Gibraltar is in part designed to distract attention from its domestic problems, including high unemployment and public anger at allegations of corruption. Europe minister David Lidington is expected to travel to Gibraltar within the next month to discuss the problems. He has admitted that the government is ’concerned’ about the impact that border delays are having on businesses in both Spain and Gibraltar . 'The delays imposed by the Spanish authorities at the border with Gibraltar continue to have a significant impact, resulting in significant changes in behaviour at the border: visitor arrivals in Gibraltar are down and vehicle traffic has fallen,’ he said in response to a parliamentary question. ’Since the beginning of the disruption last summer, the Government has raised this issue regularly with the European Commission.’ The UK government has sent a dossier on the border delays to Spain’s Director General for Home Affairs. It has also asked the European Commission to ’make follow-up visits to monitor the continuing delays’, Mr Lidington added. ’We continue to request that the Commission urge Spain to act on their recommendations and return border checks to reasonable and proportionate levels.’","Security checks still causing delays entering and leaving the Rock .

"In a maneuver straight out of the Cold War, a Russian fighter jet purposely flew 100-feet in front of the nose of an American spy plane in April, US officials confirmed on Monday. The fly-by over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan was described by one US official as 'straight out of a movie'. The same US official said the Russian jet put the lives of the US Air Force RC-135U in danger and called it 'one of the most dangerous close passes in decades.' Close-call: A Russian Su-27 fighter jet intercepted an American reconnaissance plane in international airspace over the Pacific in late April - defense officials confirmed on Tuesday . Army Col. Steve Warren, the spokesman, said the Russian Su-27 fighter flew across the nose of the U.S. Air Force RC-135U aircraft, coming within about 100 feet, while in international airspace over the Sea of Okhotsk . Army Col. Steve Warren said the US reconnaissance aircraft - which was in international air space - did not take any evasive measures. The Russian pilot maneuvered his jet in a way that exposed its belly to the American crew, he said, apparently as a way of showing that it was armed. Warren said there was no radio communication between the two planes' crews. He said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both raised the matter later with their Russian counterparts. Cold war: The near air-collision happened in April off the coast of Russia over the Sea of Okhotsk . According to CNN, the United States did not reveal the incident publicly, but Chuck Hagel and his Russian counterpart Sergey Shoygu discussed the issue. Warren said he could not explain why the incident, which happened April 23, was not made public earlier. Asked why the Pentagon didn’t disclose the incident until it was reported on Tuesday by the Washington Free Beacon, spokesman Warren said, 'I don’t have a good answer for you.' Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, a former commander in Alaska, voiced his concerns about the provocative Russian action. 'The dangerous intercept by a Russian Su-27 is far worse than we experienced during the Cold War,' McInerney told the Washington Free Beacon. 'In my four plus years as the Alaskan North American Aerospace Defense region commander at the height of the Cold War, we never saw such recklessness by the USSR.' At the highest level: US Defense Secretary spoke to his Russian counterpart Sergey Shoygu (right) about the incident - but the near-miss was kept secret . It is the latest source of concern for U.S. officials since a heightening of U.S.-Russian tensions following Moscow's intervention in Ukraine. In mid-April a Russian Su-24 fighter made low-level passes over a U.S. Navy ship in the Black Sea. An RC-135U is a highly specialized reconnaissance plane known as 'Combat Sent.' There are only two such planes in the U.S. Air Force; both are assigned to the 55th Wing at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. Their crews are from the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron and the 97th Intelligence Squadron of the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency. The 'Combat Sent' aircraft are equipped with communications gear designed to locate and identify foreign military radar signals on land, at sea and in the air. The crew is composed of two pilots, one navigator, two airborne systems engineers, at least 10 electronic warfare officers and six or more technical and other specialists.",Near mid-air collision occurred in April over the Sea of Okhotsk - 60 miles off the coast of Russia - but in International air space .
"The father of Broadchurch star David Tennant has revealed he is terminally ill and has backed plans to give patients the 'right to die'. The Very Reverend Sandy McDonald, a former Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, said he is suffering from lung condition pulmonary fibrosis. He has made an end-of life plan and has called on senior church figures to back proposed laws to give terminally-ill people 'assistance towards a peaceful death'. The Reverend Sandy McDonald (pictured left) has revealed he is terminally ill. The father of actor David Tennant (right), he backs plans to give terminally-ill people the right to die . Earlier this month, ex-Dr Who actor Tennant dedicated his special recognition prize at the National Television Awards to his 77-year-old father. Rev McDonald, of Paisley, Renfrewshire, said he did not know how long he had left to live but said it was time to give dying people more rights over end-of-life care. He said: 'I have pulmonary fibrosis. It just gets worse, there is no cure. I have had to address it and decide what to do. 'I have an advance directive which says 'do not resuscitate'. I do not want to be fed by something in my stomach. 'What I do want is the right to a peaceful end to my life.' He added: 'I think we have the wrong slant, the wrong emphasis. Ex-Dr Who actor David Tennant (pictured starring in Broadchurch  as D.I Alec Hardy with Olivia Colman as D.S Ellie Mille) dedicated his special recognition prize at the National Television Awards to his  father this month . 'The phrase - assisted suicide - has criminal overtones in the minds of many people. 'We need to take seriously the provision of a peaceful end of life for all those who need and want it. 'Of course there would have to be safeguards and that should be discussed.' The Church of Scotland is formally against a change in the law such as the Assisted Suicide Bill, which is currently being debated at Holyrood. The Bill, originally introduced by the late Margo MacDonald, has the aim of legalising suicide for terminally-ill people through the Scottish Parliament. Rev McDonald said many terminally ill people wanted to die and insisted current legislation was putting a strain on the NHS. He called on the Kirk to discuss the issue at this year's assembly in May. He said: 'We have got so many people in our nursing homes, in our care homes and our bed-blocked hospitals, whether elderly or seriously ill, who are saying 'it's time for me to die'. 'I sympathise hugely with them. 'The doctors and nurses have their hands tied because they are liable to end up in court. 'I believe it is only just that the Church come together and discuss this.' Rev McDonald filmed a special tribute to his actor son which was played before he collected his award at the NTAs. In his acceptance speech Tennant, 43, said: 'I would like to dedicate this to my dad. He is an inspiration and a role model, so thanks Sandy.' The star's father, whose wife Helen died in 2007, said he was delighted at the tribute. He added: 'The event brought a great deal of joy. 'Friends from all over have been ringing since the broadcast. Some people I have not heard from for years have been in touch to say how delighted they were. It was good to talk to them.' Rev McDonald was a minister in Lanarkshire, West Lothian and Paisley before becoming the General Secretary of the Church of Scotland's Board of Ministry. He retired in 2002.","Reverend Sandy McDonald, 77, has revealed he has pulmonary fibrosis .

"They were feared as barbarians who built one of the largest empires in the world from horseback, but it appears the Mongolian emperors were also some of the planet's biggest polluters. A new study into the silver mines of Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan, shows that the people produced four times as much pollution as modern industrial mining activities. It is thought to be one of the few examples where pre-industrial period pollution has exceeded modern day levels. Kublai Khan (above), the grandson of Genghis Khan, founded the Yuan Dynasty during which pollution from silver mining activities in the Yunnan region of south west China increased to four times modern levels . Geologists from the University of Pittsburgh and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have found pollution from heavy metals like lead, zinc and cadmium spiked between 1271AD and 1368AD in the Yunnan region of south west China. He was one of the most feared warriors in history, waging bloody war across Asia and Europe. But Genghis Khan’s 13th-century rampage may have never happened had it not been for a spell of good weather. The leader of the Mongol armies created a vast empire that eventually stretched across China, India, Russia and Eastern Europe. Historians used to think his armies of nomadic horsemen were fleeing the bleak, cold and dry Mongolian plains for warmer regions. But now scientists have discovered that the rise of the Mongol Empire coincided with a 14-year spell of weather that was the warmest and wettest for 1,000 years. The academics, from Columbia University in New York, discovered the weather anomaly by studying the rings of ancient trees. They think the conditions created those needed for a boost in lush growth of grass, which would have fuelled the soldiers' horses and fattened their livestock. The good weather lasted from 1211 to 1225 - the exact period when Genghis Khan and his armies rose to prominence. They say that this pollution was caused by large amounts of silver smelting driven by the Mongolian hunger for the precious metal, which they used to make coins, jewellery and art. Writing in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, Aubrey Hillman, who led the work, said that the impact of this pollution was still being felt today by the wildlife and environment in the area. She said: 'Culminating during the rule of the Mongols, known as the Yuan Dynasty, these metal concentrations approach levels three to four times higher than those from industrialised mining activity occurring within the catchment. 'Notably, the concentrations of lead approach levels at which harmful effects may be observed in aquatic organisms. 'The persistence of this lead pollution over time created an environmental legacy that likely contributes to known issues in modern-day sediment quality.' Miss Hillman and her colleagues extracted sediment cores from Lake Erhai in Yunnan. The mud within these sediments catalogued around 4,500 years of debris deposited on the floor of the lake. By scanning the cores for heavy metals they were able to determine how pollution levels had changed through out the areas history. In 1500BC they noticed a rapid increase in copper levels in the silt - marking the onset of the Bronze Age in southeast Asia and the birth of metallurgy in the area. They say that from around 1100AD there was an increase in lead, silver, zinc and cadmium, all linked to the smelting of silver. This map shows Lake Erhai in south west China where Mongol rulers caused heavy pollution by mining silver . The researchers took sediment core samples from Lake Erhai (pictured above) in Yunnan, south west China . The Mongol's Yuan dynasty prized silver for coins and jewelry similar to the belt shown in the picture above . However, the levels of pollution remained relatively low until 1271AD, around the time when Kublai Khan founded the Yuan dynasty and became Emperor of China. The Mongols are thought to have established the first government operated silver mine in Yuann in 1290AD and taxes from silver production came to account for 47 per cent of the national revenue. Silver smelting (shown above) can release heavy metal pollutants like lead into the environment . The Yuan Dynasty remained in power until 1368AD when they were defeated by the Ming Dynasty. The researchers found that lead pollution in Lake Erhai peaked at 119 micrograms per gram of sediment in 1300AD before then declining to to around 30 micrograms per gram in 1420AD. By 1980 they had reached fallen to 8 micrograms per gram of sediment. However, Yuann is known to be particularly rich in mineral resources and has large deposits of copper, tin, gold, silver and iron, and mining activity continues there today. Miss Hillman said: 'Our findings are unique - while pre-industrial pollution has been detected in lake sendiments over many time periods and regions of the world, only a few studies have found pre-industrial pollution levels to be greater than the modern and none of these have been in China. 'Modern pollution issues rest on a long history of decline in sediment quality at Ehrhai. 'A study of Idaho wetlands documented that the persistence of lead in sediments impacted organisms several centuries after mining activity was reduced. Similarly, we suggest that the elevated concentrations of lead due to the environmental legacy of Mongol silver mining has impacted the lake for several centuries.'","Geologists have found Mongol silver mining produced four times as much harmful heavy metal pollution than modern industrial mining activities .

"Late: Teenager Yasmin Tisbury has a hospital appointment booked for the year 2099 . A teenager who tried to book a consultation at hospital was told to come back for an appointment in 84 years' time. Yasmin Tisbury, 19, was referred for an ultrasound scan at Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Hertfordshire by her GP after complaining of stomach pains. But a month later, she received a letter telling her she had an appointment at 11am on Thursday January 1, 2099. The student will be 103 years old by the time she finally gets the scan - but as January 1 is a bank holiday, doctors may not even be working on that day. Miss Tisbury was put on hold for an hour before she was able to speak to the hospital to sort out the IT blunder. 'I thought it was funny at first, I'm not sure I can wait 84 years for a scan,' said Miss Tisbury, who is studying animal management. 'But then I got quite annoyed while I was waiting on the phone. 'It's just a mix-up but I just wanted to get the date sorted. I have already had to wait a month to get the appointment and obviously I am worried about that. 'There wasn't even a clue when the appointment might be, because we are already in February so it would obviously not be in January.

"France is pleading for troops from across Europe to bolster its peace-keeping effort in the war-torn Central African Republic. However, the UK has rejected any on-the-ground intervention to halt the escalating bloodshed between Muslim rebels who ousted president Francois Bozize and Christian militia. As France’s efforts to control growing violence in its former colony lose support at home after the deaths of two soldiers, its government will this week also urge EU countries to back the establishment of a fund to bankroll support for armies in unstable African countries. Scroll down for video . French President Francois Hollande pays tribute at the coffin of a French soldier killed in Bangui, capital of the Central African Republic. France wants its European allies to intervene in the increasingly volatile region . French troops detain a suspected rebel officer, preventing Christian mobs from lynching him near the airport in Bangui earlier this month . Both proposals, to be discussed at a . Brussels summit, are being met with scepticism by British officials. Senior sources told the Mail: ‘There is no question of British boots on . the ground. We can offer C17s [military transporter planes], but no . troops. We want to look at the detail but it is not immediately obvious . that it is something we would sign up to.’ Ministers . are wary of committing British troops to military action after the . embarrassing Commons defeat on taking action over the brutal civil war . in Syria.

President Francois Hollande has already called for the ‘permanent European fund’ for African intervention, and Mr Fabius will push for this at the European Council meeting in Brussels this week. ‘Europe does a lot but it only intervenes from time to time,’ Mr Hollande said last week during a state visit to Brazil. ‘We need a permanent European fund, not a fund for each individual operation. This should not be about us providing the armed forces on the ground and demanding that we be paid. We are neither the mercenaries nor the police of Europe.’ Mr Hollande’s handling of his economy at home is leaping from one disaster to another, leading to accusations that he is using overseas military adventures to try and increase his popularity. But he insisted:  ‘I did not come to power to make war’, adding that ‘circumstances’ had forced France to launch military operations in Mali and the Central African Republic. Radical Islam is behind much of the trouble, with an Al Qaeda army trying to seize power in Mali. The . killing and maiming of hundreds of British soldiers in countries like .

"A campaign to encourage victims of sexual abuse to write love letters to themselves has gone viral - with hundreds of people taking part. The initiative - #survivorloveletters - was started by artist Tani Ikeda, owner of ImMEDIAte Justice and a survivor of abuse herself, as an 'act of defiance' about her experiences. Tani, who lives in LA, said the movement, which has seen the letters shared on social media websites, is a 'cathartic' way in which survivors of abuse can share their stories. This letter is written by a woman called Sarah, she posted the colourful piece to herself on Valentine's Day as part of the #survivorloveletters project which was started by the artist Tani Ikeda . The project was launched on Tumblr along with with feminist activist Suey Park so that the moving accounts could be shared with and read by other victims. Tani started the initiative on Valentine's Day as it is the anniversary on the day she was abused. Tani told Femail: '[The campaign] started on Valentine's Day and #Survivorloveletter was an act of defiance, a declaration of self love and a call to allies to honor the survivors in their lives. 'I imagined what it would mean for my younger self to wake up and read message after message of public support for surviving. This letter was written to a woman named Andrea in it it says, 'I want you to know how proud I am of you for keeping your head up and your heart open to the beautiful things this world still has to offer' 'That's when I knew I wanted to create #survivorloveletter.I was incredibly grateful that activist Suey Park helped kick off #survivorloveletter on twitter and that Lisa Factora-Borcher, Patrisse Marie Cullors-Brignac, Amita Swadhin and other women I admire joined the conversation.' Tani was abused herself and said: 'Growing up, I realised story was my most powerful weapon against violence, marginalization, and a media landscape that rendered me invisible. 'Story had the capacity to heal myself and break the stigma around being a survivor of sexual violence. 'We didn't have to be ashamed about what had happened to us. We don't have to live the rest of our lives as victims.' This letter, written in green pen, said that it took this survivor a long time to come to terms with what had happened to them . Tani said she decided to set up the Tumblr initiative when she started to get a lot of submissions as she wanted a way to archive the letters. She said: 'At first, the letters were coming in mostly from family and friends, but now strangers are sending me their most intimate, painful, and brave survivor love letters. It's a real privilege to help facilitate this kind of sharing. Tani told Femail that she hopes the project will help other survivors of sexual abuse to feel less alone.

'You are the monument of survival and recovery you erected in its place. I love, and will always love, every healing part of you. 'You are a queen, you are a goddess, you are a survivor. Happy V-day. All my love and everything else, Sarah.' Another written by a man says: 'To the little five year old me: Just because they don't want to acknowledge boys get raped, doesn't make the right. Rape knows no gender.' This moving letter which has been created on a computer is from a man who had been raped as a child .

"Pies and ice cream have been a long been a staple at the American dinner table. But a new report suggests the nation's love affair with dessert is waning because of the preparation time and cost. Market research company, NPD Group, tracked the daily eating habits of 5,000 consumers across the country and found that only 12 per cent tucked into a sweet treat after dinner in the home. A sweet goodbye: Pies and ice cream have been a long been a staple at the American dinner table - but a new report suggests the nation's love affair with dessert is waning because of the preparation time and cost . It marks a decline from 15 per cent ten years ago and a dip from 24 per cent back in 1986. Despite healthy eating drives, experts say the trend has nothing to do nutritional concern and is simply down to making life simpler. Of the dessert eaters, almost 20per cent said easy-to-prepare fruit was their favorite option. Fifteen per cent plumped for cake, while 13 per cent preferred a few scoops of ice cream or cookies. The faithful pie came in at fourth place with 8.9 per cent plucking up the energy to slice it up and another classic - brownies - came bottom of the pile. Market research company, NPD Group, tracked the daily eating habits of 5,000 consumers across the country and found that only 12per cent tucked into a sweet treat after dinner in the home - It marks a decline from 15per cent ten years ago and a dip from 24per cent back in 1986 . Older Americans, adults over 65, were revealed as the heaviest dessert eaters . Commenting on the findings, Harry Balzer, senior vice president and chief food industry analyst at NPD, said: 'Dessert adds to the effort of making a meal. 'You have to prepare it and clean up, plus it adds to the cost of the meal. It’s one more thing Americans are learning to do without.' Fruit - 19.7 per cent . Cake - 14.3 per cent . Ice cream -13.9 per cent . Cookies - 13.8 per cent . Pie - 8.9 per cent . Frozen Novelties - 6.3 per cent . Candy - 5.3 per cent . Pudding - 3.8 per cent . Salty snacks - 2.8 per cent . Brownies - 2.7 per cent . Older Americans, adults over 65, were revealed as the heaviest dessert eaters. They reported eating a sweet course at home twice as often as any other age group. However, even they are cutting back. For the year ending February 2014, people over 65 ate 76 desserts per person per year at home. In 2000, they ate 104 desserts per person per year at home. The analysis came from the NPD Group's 29th annual Eating Patterns in America report. Balzer suggests the culinary trend in American homes is about one-dish main meals. He jokingly concluded: 'If this trend continues, desserts may entirely disappear from the dinner table. 'We are on target to serve the last dessert on Feb. 27, 2054.'","Market research company, NPD Group, tracked the daily eating habits of 5,000 consumers across the country .

The mercury has dropped so low that three of the five Great Lakes have completely frozen over. As February draws to a close, records will likely show it is the fifth coldest on record for swathes of the east coast, according to ABC. In Detroit, the month is expected to be the second coldest since records began in 1874. Temperatures in the Michigan city dropped to 14.6 degrees on Wednesday. The record was set in 1875, according to the Detroit News.

The snow in Alabama has also delayed jury selection in the capital murder trial of a woman accused of making her granddaughter run until she died. Some roads were still icy in northeast Alabama around Etowah County early Friday, and officials say Joyce Hardin Garrard's trial won't get started until Monday as a precaution. Authorities say Garrard forced nine-year-old Savannah Hardin to run for hours as punishment for a lie three years ago. The girl eventually collapsed and died days later in a hospital. The defense says Garrard is innocent. Attorneys were first supposed to begin questioning jurors in court on Wednesday, but the judge postponed the session because of winter weather. The same thing happened Thursday when snow blanketed the county. On Thursday most of the country had a break from the snow - despite storms earlier in the week forcing schools, roads and businesses to close. Thousands of people in the Carolinas, Virginia, Alabama and Georgia were also left without power as falling trees knocked down power lines. This is the third storm to hit the Deep South in less than a week. Since the storms began, airlines have been severely affected, canceling nearly 7,000 flights in the past seven days. For Thursday, more than 1,300 flights had been canceled nationwide and another 4,400 delayed, according to tracking site FlightAware.com. By 11.45 on Friday, more than 4,000 flights had already been affected - 399 were cancelled and 1,049 delayed. Huntsville, Alabama, received 8.1 inches on Wednesday, breaking a daily record.

"More than a quarter of a million car insurance claims are made each year in the US alone for damages caused by hail stones. And now an inventor has devised a 'bouncy castle-inspired' system to protect vehicles from these storms. Called Hail Protector, the cover inflates within five minutes to surround a car or truck and stops stones damaging the chassis beneath. Scroll down for video . The inflatable protector was inspired by a bouncy castle and was designed by Texas-based Michael Siciliano. It works with an early warning app that gives drivers up to 30 minutes notice about the chances of a hail storm at four different locations. These locations can include the driver's home or office, for example . The protector was designed by Texas-based Michael Siciliano. It works with an early warning app that gives drivers up to 30 minutes notice about the chances of a hail storm at four different locations. These locations can include the driver's home or office, for example. But the process isn't quick. The driver must get to their vehicle, unpack the cover and place it over their car, plug in the remote control and hit a button to start inflating it - which alone takes five minutes. Once inflated, though, its makers claim the cover can protect cars from hail stones as large as 2lbs (1kg). The button on the remote is powered through a car battery or plug socket and it activates four blowers typically used as cooling fans in desktop computers. Once forewarned, the driver must get to their vehicle, unpack the cover and place it over their car (left), plug in the remote control and hit a button to start inflating it - which alone takes five minutes. Air flow remains constant throughout the storm and once it passes, the cover can be compacted to fit in a boot (right) Air flow remains constant - much like a bouncy castle - throughout the storm and once it passes, the cover can be compacted to fit in a boot. Depending on the length of the storm, this could also have an impact on the car's battery life - especially when stationary. The protector was designed by Texas-based Michael Siciliano.

Air flow remains constant - much like a bouncy castle - throughout the storm and once it passes, the cover can be compacted to fit in a boot. Mr Siciliano, 48, said: 'Physically, the Hail Protector System uses similar principles to bouncy castles. 'In 2009 it came to me that there is no solution for protecting vehicles from the damaging effect of hail. 'I was working in renewable energy at the time, but throughout my career I would look at an issue or problem and ask 'why don't they come up with something that will fix this?'' The system has been publicly tested against air cannons, cantaloupes, coconuts, watermelons and baseball pitching machines. Additionally, the system has been tested in winds in excess of 60mph (97km/h) and comes with an instructional video of how to use it. The Hail Protector is available in six sizes - three for sedans, hatchbacks and wagons and three for SUVs, vans and trucks. These range from vehicles 10ft (3.3 metres) up to 22ft (6.7 metres) long. Prices start at $349 (£226) and the inventors are in talks to set up distribution centres in Europe. Mr Siciliano added: 'We are in the final development of a new option for The Hail Protector System. 'The option will enable activation and deactivation of the system via a text message from anywhere in the world. 'We are also developing a mobile app for the system which will provide alerting in a more informational way and will eventually enable the user to press a button within the mobile app to activate and deactivate their system.

"Investigators said Thursday they have recovered 32,000 emails related to a former IRS official at the heart of the agency's tea party scandal. But they don't know how many of them are new. The emails were to and from Lois Lerner, who used to head the IRS division that processes applications for tax-exempt status. Last June, the IRS told Congress it had lost an unknown number of Lerner's emails when her computer hard drive crashed in 2011. Scroll down for videos . Eureka! Investigators said Thursday they have recovered 32,000 emails related to former IRS official Lois Lerner (pictured last March) at the heart of the agency's tea party scandal . Lerner was forced into early retirement after it emerged that she presided over a scheme in which IRS agents improperly singled out tea party and other conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status . At the time, IRS officials said the emails could not be recovered. But at a congressional hearing Thursday evening, investigators said they recovered thousands of emails from old computer tapes used to back up the agency's email system. 'We recovered quite a number of emails but until we compare those to what's already been produced we don't know if they're new emails,' Timothy Camus, a Treasury deputy inspector general for tax administration, told the House Oversight Committee. Neither Camus nor the inspector general, J. Russell George, would describe the contents of any of the emails at Thursday's hearing. The IRS says it has already produced 78,000 Lerner emails, many of which have been made public by congressional investigators. Camus said it took investigators two weeks to locate the computer tapes that contained Lerner's emails. He said it took technicians about four months to find Lerner's emails on the tapes. Several Oversight Committee members questioned how hard the IRS tried to produce the emails, given how quickly independent investigators found them. The House voted mostly along party lines to hold Ms Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions at the hearings . 'We have been patient. We have asked, we have issued subpoenas, we have held hearings,' said Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican and chairman of the committee. 'It's just shocking me that you start, two weeks later you're able to find the emails.' The IRS issued a statement saying the agency 'has been and remains committed to cooperating fully with the congressional oversight investigations. The IRS continues to work diligently with Congress as well as support the review by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration.' Lerner, who was in charge of the IRS's Exempt Organizations Division, drew a top-tier salary that reached $177,000 . The IRS estimated it has spent $20million responding to congressional inquiries, generating more than 1million pages of documents and providing agency officials to testify at 27 congressional hearings. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, questioned the significance of the recovered emails in an exchange with Camus. 'So as I understand it from your testimony here today, you are unable to confirm whether there are any, to use your own words, new emails, right?' she asked Camus. 'That is correct,' Camus replied. Maloney: 'So what's before us may be material you already have, right?' Camus: 'That is correct.' Maloney: 'So may I ask, why are we here?' The inspector general set off a firestorm in May 2013 with an audit that said IRS agents improperly singled out tea party and other conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status during the 2010 and 2012 elections. Several hundred groups had their applications delayed for a year or more. Some were asked inappropriate questions about donors and group activities, the inspector general's report said. The week before George's report, Lerner publicly apologized on behalf of the agency. After the report, much of the agency's top leadership was forced to retire or resign, including Lerner. The Justice Department and several congressional committees launched investigations. Lerner's lost emails prompted a new round of scrutiny by Congress, and a new investigation by the inspector general's office. Lerner emerged as a central figure in the controversy after she refused to answer questions at two House Oversight hearings, invoking her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself at both hearings. At the first hearing, Lerner made a statement saying she had done nothing wrong. Last year, the House voted mostly along party lines to hold her in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions at the hearings. It also has emerged this week that Lerner received $129,000 in bonuses during the years when she allegedly oversaw the program unfairly targeting conservative nonprofits. Lerner, then in charge of the IRS's Exempt Organizations Division, drew a top-tier salary that reached $177,000 – plus a 25 per cent 'retention bonus.'","Retrieved emails were to and from Lois Lerner, former head the IRS division that processes applications for tax-exempt status .

"A Dallas bride-to-be has been left devastated 36 days before she says 'I do' after a mix-up over her doily-covered wedding invitations. Natalie DeGraffenreid ordered custom, doily-decorated invitations from the Arlington-based company, Art by Ellie. But what she received in the mail was apparently not what she ordered. Her distress began when she opened the package from stationary firm - half of her invitations allegedly had the wrong doily design. DeGraffenreid was so upset about the doilies that she turned to her local ABC TV station to warn others of her experience. Natalie DeGraffenreid and Cory Teague, who have been engaged since March 2014 and are expected to marry this spring. But the bride-to-be was left devastated after she had a mix-up with wedding invitations she ordered . DeGraffenreid ordered invitations from Arts by Ellie. The company allegedly contacted her to tell her they had ran out of the doily she wanted and ordered a second one, but she didn't realize how different it would be . DeGraffenreid, a nurse, placed her invitation order in early January, paid a $500 deposit and signed the company's contract, she told ABC 8. But problems set in when the company allegedly said only half of the invitations for her April wedding were ready, claiming there weren't enough of the same doilies for the entire order. 'When she e-mailed me a few days later and said she didn't have the same pattern - that she was ordering a new one - she said it was different. I didn't know how different,' the bride-to-be said. 'It matters to me. I'm the bride and I'm the one that paid for it,' DeGraffenreid, who has been engaged to Cory Teague since March 2014, added. One doily the bride-to-be received had swirly designs, while the other was more symmetrical and had more holes, it is reported. She said that Art by Ellie did not fulfill its part of the transaction, so she has not paid the remainder of the bill. After DeGraffenreid contacted the six-year-old stationary company asking for a refund or discount, she said the owner told her a full refund would not be an option and that the bride-to-be's payment was overdue. Lauren Heymann, owner of Art by Ellie reportedly said in a statement to ABC that she was 'very sorry she [DeGraffenreid] is so upset about the doilies'. Heymann said that she offered DeGraffenreid some kind of a refund, but the bride-to-be denies, and said the stationary firm owner instead reminded her of the contract she signed. 'We are not under contract for a guaranteed specific delivery date, a specific envelope, or a specific doily pattern with your contract,'' DeGraffenreid read from an e-mail she said Heymann sent. 'That means she could give me whatever she wanted... and she did.' The bride-to-be was so disappointed that she contacted the company and asked for a refund, but she said the company told her she needs to pay in full . Arts by Ellie owner Lauren Heymann said in a statement that she was 'very sorry' about DeGraffenreid's disappointment with the doilies and said she had tried to give some kind of refund . DeGraffenreid said that she is unsure as to how she will proceed with the invitation situation. But she does hope that other brides-to-be don't have to go through the same experience . DeGraffenreid was contacted earlier this week by an attorney representing Art by Ellie demanding she pay the remainder of her bill, it is alleged. On the Art by Ellie website, the company ensures that customers see their products before they go to print. 'Of course; you are involved every step of the way. We work with you to get a feel for your event style and then we begin working on your first round of proofs,' the company says on their FAQ page. 'The first e-mail will usually contain a few concepts and then we'll go from there, making changes until it’s perfect, and we wouldn’t dream of sending anything to the printers without your final approval.' It is unknown if DeGraffenreid saw her doilies before they reached her by post. The bride-to-be told ABC that she's unsure how she will proceed, but she hopes others won't have to go through the same stress she did. On the couple's wedding site, which has since been deleted, DeGraffenreid and Teague said they are getting married on April 4. This isn't the first time DeGraffenreid made headlines during her engagement. She and Teague, were in the news in March 2014 after he proposed to her during an awards ceremony for his fire department after two years of dating. She was shocked at the proposal and had no idea it was coming, according to Fox 4. DailyMail has attempted to contact Ms Heymann for comment. Teague proposed to DeGraffenreid in March 2014 at an awards ceremony for his fire department. The proposal made headlines and the bride-to-be said she never saw it coming . The couple dated for two years before getting engaged.

He told a TV station they had been divorced for two years but maintained they had a 'strong relationship' Investigators discovered her blood inside a blue Hyundai Sonata that was stolen from outside her home when she was slayed. Police located the car blocks away and, according to the Dallas Morning News, found links to the suspect's blood inside. Moses, who has a 20-year-old son with his ex-wife, Igor, was interviewed by detectives on January 15 who found a fresh cut on his right hand. He voluntarily submitted a fingerprint and tests revealed traces in the car were a positive match. Mrs Moses had worked at the University of Texas, Dallas, since 2005. Her colleagues at the school, where Moses worked as the assistant director of strategic planning and analysis at the college, requested police to carry out the welfare check on the home when she failed to show up for work. Devastating: Mrs Moses' body was discovered after she failed to turn up for work at the University of Texas. Her concerned colleagues then asked police to do a welfare check on her home . Authorities then discovered her body and the car missing from her driveway. At the time of her death, university spokesman John Walls said: 'The news of Anna's passing is a shock to the University community. She will be sorely missed.' Police transported Robert Moses to the Frisco Police Detention Center and charged him with murder. His bond was set at $1 million. At the time of her death, a family friend said Moses recently had been seeing another man, but it's unknown whether investigators had spoken to him. Friend Donna Ross called Moses a 'very kind, very loving, very caring, very intelligent person'. 'I can't imagine anyone wanting to harm her in any way,' she said. Russian-born Moses divorced husband Bob Moses about two years ago but they remained friendly and continued to bring up their 20-year-old son, Igor, together. Probe: Moses  told the TV station he and 20-year-old son Igor (pictured) were co-operating with the investigation . Scene: Investigators arrived at her home in Frisco, Texas, last month and found her car had been stolen from the drive. It was rediscovered in the neighborhood and is believed to have traces of Moses' DNA inside .","Anna Moses was found dead in her Frisco, Texas home, on January 14 .

"Army medics are being recruited to help fill nursing vacancies at Colchester General Hospital . Army medics are being drafted in to help fill nursing gaps at a hospital plunged into special measures amid concerns over cancer waiting times. Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust which runs the town's general hospital and Essex County Hospital, has more than 215 nursing vacancies at the moment. The trust was placed in special measures in 2013 amid allegations that staff were being forced to change cancer waiting times. And last month Colchester General Hospital was rated inadequate by the health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission. The trust has introduced a series of initiatives in a bid to address the staffing shortfall. Additional bank staff from other agencies will also continue to fill shifts. But now, bosses are hoping to draw on a long-standing agreement with troops stationed in the Essex town. Combat medical technicians from 16 Medical Regiment, based at Colchester Garrison, will work at the hospital when they are not on duty. It is understood they will predominantly be deployed in A&E and other urgent care areas. An agreement has been reached, the hospital said, but the number of army medics taking part has yet to be finalised. A trust spokesman said: 'We have been talking to Colchester Garrison about the possibility of using their combat medical technicians as bank nurses. 'The garrison has been supportive of this and has said that, as long as the individual medics' commanding officer is happy for them to work here on the bank when they are off duty, it's fine by them.' He added that those medics leaving the Army are being targeted as part of the trust's recruitment drive. Colchester MP Sir Bob Russell, welcomed the plans. He said: 'When I visited the hospital last month, in the wake of concerns over staffing levels with particular reference to accident and emergency, I suggested an approach be made to 16 Medical Regiment for mutual aid. 'I did so in the knowledge, from my visits to the field hospital at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, that many of the medics were members of the Army Reserve who worked for the NHS. 'Army medics would get continuing real-life situations to deal with, and the public would have additional qualified medical personnel to assist the hospital. 'This really is a win-win situation.' Combat medical technicians from 16 Medical Regiment, based at Colchester Garrison, will work at the hospital when they are not on duty, predominantly in A&E and other urgent care areas. Pictured are army medics treating an injured member of the Afghan National Army in Helmand Province, Afghanistan . A Colchester Garrison spokesman told the Ipswich Star: 'There are long-standing arrangements in place for personnel from Colchester-based 16 Medical Regiment to carry out clinical placements at both Colchester General Hospital and Ipswich Hospital. 'With the permission of their chain of command and provided it does not interfere with their military duties, soldiers are able to take on additional work in their spare time.' Separately, as part of a large recruitment drive, the trust has offered 48 jobs to Filipino nurses, 40 of whom have accepted. As they are not EU citizens, they cannot start work straight away. In addition, between mid-October and February 9, 25 UK registered nurses have agreed to join the trust. During a board meeting on Thursday, trust bosses outlined plans to become a 'much more flexible trust' for nurses. Lynn Lane, director of human resources, said: 'We're no longer saying 'no' to people just because they can't do a Tuesday or Wednesday morning. 'We are thinking of much more creative ways to ensure we are being as flexible as possible.'","Colchester hospitals have around 215 nursing vacancies at the moment .

"Deborah Norville is celebrating 20 years at Inside Edition - and tells how her heartbreak at being separated from her family while on the road led to her joining the show. The mother of three freely admits she put her backpack to rest after filming one particularly gut-wrenching news story. The two-time Emmy winner, 56, says: 'I had extra pages in my passport because I was travelling so much. I was in Brazil and my little boy called me crying 'mommy, please come home'. 'We were on a story about a woman who kidnapped back her son in violation of an agreement with her ex husband in Tunisia,' she says: 'We were with these former Delta Force commandos, all very cloak and dagger, whom she had hired after exhausting every resource, spending her last dollar and selling her furniture to finance these efforts.' Scroll down for video . Celebrations: Deborah Norville on Inside Edition this week - celebrating 20 years on air . Quitting for family: Deborah, seen in 2005, said she made the decision to get a job closer to home . Mommy and me: Deborah Norville and her newborn daughter in 1997 . Waiting for the mother and son, Deborah said they eventually arrived four hours late after being detained by the border authorities in Tunisia. She said: 'When they put the key in the motor to crank up the boat, it didn't start, they had come in on fumes. 'And that really hit me, because here I am, 5,000 miles away from my own child and this woman has given up everything to be reunited with hers. Happily married to husband Karl Wellner since 1987, Deborah added: 'For me, this was an epiphany, as a journalist that was a really cool story and it hit on a number of levels, but for me personally, as a mom, a woman and a wife, it was like 'what are you doing this for? when are you going to grow up? 'This is great, you're going to cool places, you're doing nifty stuff, but you have a husband and a son and you may have a two or a four-year-deal with CBS news, but you have a lifetime contract with these people, and that's when I called my agent and said 'when my deal is up I need something where I am an anchor, by anchor, I mean glued, rooted to a show. 'CBS was offering me the evening weekend anchor job, but I would have still been on the road during the week, so that's when I thanked them and went to Inside Edition.' The willowy blonde, who was one of Joan Rivers' best friends', started on Inside Edition, succeeding Bill O’Reilly, on March 5, 1995. Inside Edition remains a steady ship in the network sea, averaging 4.7 million viewers last November, second only to Entertainment Tonight. Deborah revealed: 'I actually wrote into my contract you cannot travel more than a certain number of days, but I've never come close to that as I'm stuck in the studio! 'I thought 'If I'm going to have a long career, I need to be successful for whoever I work for, but also successful as a person'.' Friends in high places: Deborah Norville with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . Beloved pal: Deborah Norville, her husband Karl Wellner and Joan Rivers. Deborah gave a eulogy at Joan's funeral following her death in September . The young girl from Dalton, Georgia, had no expectations of a career where she would end up interviewing the British Prime Minister in front of the nation. But from winning Junior Miss to shining as the only journalist to interview President Jimmy Carter when he returned to his home state of Georgia in 1979 when she still a college senior, it was clear that Deborah was a natural. Her star rose, and she joined the Today show in September 1989 on the newsdesk and took over from Jane Pauley as co-anchor in October 1989. Moments she cherishes include interviewing British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in October 1990, just weeks after Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait. 'How long will we have?', the Iron Lady asked, to which Deborah replied: 'Unfortunately, Madame Prime Minister, this is live TV, so we'll have four or five minutes if we're lucky.' 'Oh, so you'd like my answers snappy', Mrs Thatcher said, and as Deborah recounts: 'She very snappily proceed to tell me that over dinner the night before, she and President George HW Bush decided while it would be nice if there was a UN resolution authorizing the invasion of Iraq, it wasn't necessary, and that Britain and the US were prepared to go in and defend Kuwait. 'As a reporter, you have moments when that bell goes off in your head, but the bell was going off around the world, on wire machines - yes, those still existed - that the US and UK were prepared to unilaterally defend Kuwait.' 'That', Deborah says, a touch modestly, 'was cool.' But viewers quickly complained there no chemistry between Deborah and co-host Bryant Gumbel, and soon after Deborah went on maternity leave to have her first son Niki in February 1991, it was announced she would not be returning, Katie Couric taking her place instead. Rebounding, Deborah got her own radio show with ABC radio network, which launched in September 1991 and then joined CBS news in 1993, first on Street Stories then on America Tonight. Fascinating: For Inside Edition in 2000, Deborah Norville spent a week in prison in North Carolina . Hard-going: Deborah said she met women with harrowing stories during her time in prison - including one teenager who had grown up with drug-addict parents and another whose teeth were rotted away due to crack . One of Deborah's most defining TV moments came when she was incarcerated for a week on Inside Edition in February 2000. She laughed: 'The idea actually has its roots as one of the executives was a fan of the HBO show OZ and so they went to the Federal Prison system and said 'we want to put Deborah in jail' and the Federal Prison, to my everlasting gratitude, said 'no, we won't take her'. However, the execs then called every single department of corrections 'Not even Aslaka would take me on', Deborah says: 'I thought I was off the hook!' But they soon found a sheriff in Davidson, North Carolina, who ran what he called 'the toughest jail in America'. Deborah said: 'He said 'she don't get out till I say she gets out!'. They put me in there for a week and it was like cuckoo land. 'There were six beds, at one point i think we were up to 18 in there. It was a real window on what American jails were like. Junior Miss! With a talent for sewing, Deborah Norville's road to success started when she entered the Whitfield Co. (GA) Junior Miss Pageant in 1975 - and won . Live on TV! Deborah's passion for TV was sparked by her appearance during the live Junior Miss finals - and the cameraman lying at her feet! Budding reporter: Deborah Norville as a young journalist . 'One woman was in there for attempted murder. The story, to hear her tell it, was that her boyfriend spontaneously combusted. The prosecution seemed to feel that gasoline and a match were somehow involved.' A teenager, who had grown up in a house with crack-addict parents who had once sold her bedroom furniture for drugs, was in armed robbery with intent to kill to fund her own drug addiction. She thought that LSD was not a drug. Deborah said: 'There was another woman, she pulled her mouth back and she showed me where her molars should have been, but the dental material was all gone and nothing was left by the fillings which is what crack will do, it's same as meth mouth. I'm pretty sure she lost brain material as well.' Admitting it was a 'high impact stunt', Deborah said: 'I'll be damned if I'll let them make me a pawn in a stunt. I wanted there to be some journalism there, and in fact at that point, when they put me in jail, the jail population in America was rising at a rate of nine per cent a year, that's staggering. 'And I was able to show there's nothing happening in jail that's going to prevent any of these people from doing any of the activities that got them there in the first place.' As for the future, Deborah said: 'I love what I do, we do great work at Inside Edition - and here's to another 20 years!'

"A Nazi-themed troupe of dancers and a  Second World War tank gate-crashed the start of Ukip’s spring conference in Margate today. Performers in hot pants, jackboots and Nazi insignia goose-stepped to 'Springtime For Hitler' as delegates arrived in the Kent seaside town - including Nigel Farage's German wife Kirsten. The scene overshadowed the opening session of the conference, ahead of Mr Farage's key-note speech this afternoon. Scroll down for video . The dancers, from Mel Brooks’s musical The Producers, caused the scene outside Ukip’s conference venue - the Winter Gardens in Margate, Kent . Nigel Farage was upstaged this morning as dancing Nazis and a 16 tonne World War II TANK crashed UKIP's conference . The dancers, from Mel Brooks’s musical The Producers, caused the scene outside Ukip’s conference venue - the Winter Gardens in Margate, Kent. A seven-strong troupe of female dancers performed a choreographed routine as Springtime For Hitler blared from a PA system on the tank turret. The cast were in Margate to promote the new touring production of the musical comedy about a failed producer who tried to put on the worst show ever. The new UK production will features stand-up comics Jason Manford, Phill Jupitus and Ross Noble – as well as TV celebrity Louie Spence. It comes as Mr Farage prepared to address the Ukip conference this afternoon after jetting back from the US where he spoke at America's leading conservative conference in Washington. The Ukip leader flew to Washington to address the gathering of hardcore activists before catching a ‘red eye’ flight home overnight to get back in time for the Ukip conference. Kirsten Farage, wife of Ukip leader Nigel Farage, greets delegates as they arrive for the Ukip Spring Conference at the Winter Gardens Theatre in Margate, Kent today . Former Channel 4 Gogglebox stars Andrew and Carolyne Michael attend the Ukip spring conference today . Ukip MP Mark Reckless was given a standing ovation by delegates at the party's spring conference. Among . But Mr Farage was handed the 'graveyard' speaking slot at the end of the day and was forced to address an audience of just 250 in a convention centre with a capacity for over 5,000. Mr Farage delivered his speech to row after row of empty chairs just an hour after the hall had been packed for a speech by Sarah Palin, the darling of Tea Party conservatives. But the Ukip leader was given a major boost today after research was published indicating he is on track to win the nearby seat of South Thanet. The Survation survey, funded by party donor Alan Bown, put Mr Farage on 39 per cent ahead of Labour rival Will Scobie on 28 per cent when people were prompted with candidate names. A previous poll by Tory Lord Ashcroft in November had suggested the Conservatives could retain the seat - where their MP Laura Sandys is stepping down. At the party's conference today, Ukip MP Mark Reckless today warned delegates the party will not grow unless it can shake off the taint of xenophobia and demonstrate it is the ‘party of the NHS’. Mr Reckless, who won a by-election in Rochester and Strood after defecting from the Tories, said currently voters knew Ukip wanted to leave the EU and cut immigration. Ukip delegates were out in force in Margate today ahead of Nigel Farage's speech this afternoon . But the party must ‘talk about other things as well’ and reassure people it is not a threat to the NHS in order to have wider appeal. Mr Reckless told activists: ‘There are two things most people know about us - we want to leave the European Union, and we want to cut immigration. ‘We should talk about those things. But if we want to get beyond 20 per cent-30 per cent of the vote to the 40 per cent or so we will need to win constituencies, we will have to explain why we want those things, challenge some of the misconceptions there are around our party, and talk about other things as well.’ Speaking in the US last night Mr Farage warned the Republican gathering that they risked becoming dinosaurs like the Conservatives in the UK if they continued to embrace the political centre. Mr Farage slammed David Cameron over his failure to identify the infamous ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John.' 'Of course they should have told us his name,' he said. 'We should have heard it weeks ago. This information's been known for a long time.' He also claimed the name was leaked to cover yesterday's immigration figures. 'By sheer coincidence,' he said, Emwazi's name was published 'on the day when the government has to announce the worst immigration figures ever seen in the history of the United Kingdom.' He also hit out against CAGE, the British NGO that often advocates on behalf of radicalized Muslims and brands their detractors 'Islamophobes.' 'Yes, yes, yes!' Farage exploded when asked if the group was an embarrassment to most Britons. 'It's politcal correctness! 'I mean, we see protests on a regular basis with these groups on the streets of London saying and shouting things that – if you and I did them, we'd find ourselves behind bars in very short order.' 'We actually have a Judeo-Christian culture,' he added. 'It's actually in our Constitution, so let's stand up for it. 'The thing about us 'is that we have been, of all the European countries, the most tolerant of all different religions and all different groups who have come to Britain.' While 'private observance' of any religion 'is fine,' he insisted, 'unless we live under one law we're in trouble.' Nigel Farage flew to Washington to address America's leading conservative conference - but hardly anyone showed up to listen . 'WE'RE NOT THE TEA PARTY': Nigel Farage, whose UK Independence Party is challenging both Tories and Liberals, said his is a real political force, not just an influence group trying to reform a wayward party . Mr Farage said the Republican Party was 'going through the same crisis of identity as the Conservative Party in Britain'. Ukip, he boasted, was 'an insurgent political force that has taken on the political establishment and rocked them to the backs of their heels.' But he said: 'We're not the tea party. Our job is not to influence one political party. We're not an outlier from the Tories.'","Performers in Nazi insignia goose-stepped to 'Springtime For Hitler'

"In a move that may ease — or exacerbate — spiraling tensions with Israel over a potential Iran nuclear deal, the White House has decided against snubbing America's leading pro-Israel lobby and will send President Barack Obama's National Security Adviser Susan Rice and U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power to the annual policy conference. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee announced Thursday that Rice and Power would speak at its conference that begins this weekend, and the White House's top spokesman confirmed their attendance at his daily briefing. The White House's decision to name Rice as one of its liaisons is a tacit acknowledgement of its support for remarks she made earlier this week claiming that House Speaker John Boehner and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had 'injected a degree of partisanship' into the relationship between the two countries when they planned a Washington visit for the world leader without first notifying the Obama administration. The White House has decided against snubbing America's leading pro-Israel lobby and will send President Barack Obama's National Security Adviser Susan Rice to speak to the group. The White House's decision to name Rice as one of its liaisons is a tacit acknowledgement of its support for remarks she made earlier this week claiming that House Speaker John Boehner and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had 'injected a degree of partisanship' into the relationship between the two countries . Rice, appearing on a PBS program when she made the assertion, said the move was 'destructive to the fabric of the relationship' between Israel and the United States. Asked about her comments on Wednesday afternoon, a spokesman for the White House claimed Rice's comments were consistent with the administration's past statements. Rice, a top national security adviser to the president, was simply making the argument that 'reducing the U.S.-Israeli relationship to just a relationship between two political parties is destructive to a relationship between our two countries,' the spokesman, Eric Schultz contended. 'The President himself has raised this concern.' Moments later, Schultz said, 'So what we hope is that we'll continue to see leadership in this country and in Israel that will not allow the relationship between our two countries to be dragged down by party politics.' For generations 'both countries have succeeded in not allowing this critically important international relationship to get buffeted by those kinds of political arguments' that the president believes could be harmful to both countries' national security, Schultz said. Rice, however, appeared to be engaging in the same kind of 'destructive' behavior that the White House has said it is seeking to avoid. U.S. officials had floated the idea of sending a non-Cabinet level official to the event to show the administration's deep displeasure with Netanyahu over his speech to Congress next week, in which he will argue against an Iran deal but decided against and on Thursday said it would offer up Rice and Power. In their as-yet unscheduled appearances at the AIPAC conference that runs from Sunday to Tuesday, Rice and Power will stress the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship and the administration's commitment to Israel's security, according to American officials. But, they will also make the administration's case for the ongoing negotiations with Iran before an audience of more than 16,000 pro-Israel activists that is likely to be hostile to the talks and deeply concerned by growing animosity between Obama and Netanyahu and their top aides over the prime minister's speech and his opposition to one of the president's signature foreign policy goals. In a break with protocol, the invitation for Netanyahu to speak was orchestrated by Republican congressional leaders without input from the White House or State Department, angering senior administration officials who believe it was politically motivated. Netanyahu declined an invitation to meet privately with Democratic members of Congress and a number of Democrats have said they will not attend the speech. No senior U.S. officials will meet Netanyahu during his trip to Washington. The administration has said the visit is too close to Israel's upcoming elections and it doesn't want to demonstrate any favoritism. Both Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry will be out of the country for the visit's duration on travel that was organized only after the prime minister's trip was announced. The White House is also sending U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power to the annual policy conference in an apparent effort to try to tamp down an increasingly vitriolic back-and-forth between the U.S. and its top Mideast ally. But, it is not at all clear if it will have that effect . The administration's choice of Rice and Power to address the AIPAC conference, at which Netanyahu will also speak, is an apparent effort to try to tamp down an increasingly vitriolic back-and-forth between the U.S. and its top Mideast ally. But, it is not at all clear if it will have that effect. After Rice's remarks on Charlie Rose's PBS program, Kerry openly questioned Netanyahu's judgment in opposing a potential Iran deal, recalling his support for the 2003 Iraq war and prediction that it would bring stability to the Middle East. 'He may have a judgment that just may not be correct here,' the secretary told a congressional hearing. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday that sending Cabinet members to speak at the annual policy conference was consistent with the administration's participation in the past, other than the two times Obama spoke himself, and that scheduling the speeches this close to the conference wasn't unusual. 'Certainly if it's perceived by some as an effort to demonstrate bipartisan support for the relationship between the United States and Israel, that would be great,' he told reporters. At a Capitol Hill news conference on Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner rejected Rice's criticism, arguing that a 'bad deal' with Iran would be counterproductive. 'The president's national security adviser says that it's destructive for the prime minister of Israel to address the United States Congress next week. I couldn't disagree more,' Boehner told reporters. 'The American people, and both parties in Congress, have always stood with Israel. Nothing and no one should get in the way of that.' That's why it is 'so important for the American people to hear what Prime Minister Netanyahu has to say about the grave threats that they're facing,' Boehner continued. 'So I'm glad the prime minister is coming and I'm glad that most of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will be there to hear what he has to say.' Rep. Nita Lowey spoke to Netanyahu earlier this month and suggested that he deliver his speech in the congressional auditorium behind closed doors, a venue that accommodates all lawmakers and would allow for any classified information that Israel might have on Iran's capabilities, according to a senior House lawmaker. That alternative was also presented to Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer in private meeting earlier this month with a half dozen Jewish House Democrats. So far, no changes to his speech have been made, however, and it scheduled to be broadcast to the public.","It has decided against snubbing America's leading pro-Israel lobby .

"The BBC paid out more than £228million to staff for working unsociable and unpredictable hours, fuelling worries it is wasting licence fee payers' money. The revelation comes just a day after MPs slammed the corporation for being profligate with public cash. Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that thousands of BBC employees take home an average of almost £4,000 on top of their basic salaries, as a reward for working irregular hours. Waste: The BBC paid out more than £228million to staff for working unsociable and unpredictable hours, a Freedom of Information Act request revealed . They are allowed to claim a so-called 'flexibility' or 'unpredictability' allowance if they are asked to work on a scheduled day off, or start earlier or stay later than their timetabled hours. Between the start of 2009 and the end of last year, the corporation lavished £187.4million on these payments, also known as 'alarm clock' bonuses. And it dished out a further £41.7million of extra payments to staff working between midnight and 6am, to compensate for the inconvenience of working at antisocial times. In an average year, 7,941 BBC employees claimed £31.2million of unpredictability allowances, meaning they took home around £3,929 each. Many workers make multiple claims, and in some cases staff are able to claim night pay and unpredictability allowances for the same shift – helping some BBC employees to bump up their salaries by a third. The corporation said that the lavish bonuses were necessary to keep the BBC's news operation going through the night. A BBC spokesman said: 'It's impossible to broadcast 24 hours a day, seven days a week without employing people to work through the nights. Scrapped: The Culture, media and Sport select committee said the £145.50 BBC licence fee should be abolished by the end of the next decade . Slammed: The Culture, Media and Sport select committee was scathing in its criticism of the BBC's approach to spending public money . 'Like most organisations we reflect this in our pay structure – however, we're always looking to make savings and unpredictability allowance has come down by £4million since 2010.' He added: 'In that same period pay restraint, combined with headcount reductions, has to date saved the BBC £150million per year.' MPs have attacked the BBC for its ‘shocking’ decision to sell Television Centre to a firm they say was ‘a tax avoidance scheme’. In 2012, the corporation sold its West London headquarters to Whitewood, a consortium of businesses which channels its funds through Luxembourg. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, asked BBC executives ‘what on Earth’ made them agree to the £200million deal. ‘This was clearly a tax avoidance scheme,’ she said, adding: ‘You are a public body and my view is when you dispose of what effectively are public assets there is a responsibility on you to ensure the people you deal with do not avoid tax.’ Anne Bulford, who became the BBC’s finance chief after the deal, said the corporation had taken ‘full legal advice’ and concluded that Whitewood was not doing anything illegal. A spokesman for Stanhope, one of the firms involved in Whitewood, said the consortium was ‘a perfectly lawful vehicle for transactions of this nature’. However, MPs branded the payments unnecessary. John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley, said: 'The BBC often unnecessarily puts someone in live situations when the story could be told just as well without doing that. 'If it weren't paid by an effective poll tax, it might be different. The BBC tends not to be driven by the need to be efficient.' Yesterday, the Culture, Media and Sport select committee was scathing in its criticism of the BBC's approach to spending public money. In a major report entitled Future of the BBC, it painted a devastating picture of an organisation that has blown millions of pounds trying to be 'all things to all people' – including £100million on its failed Digital Media Initiative technology project. MPs ordered the corporation to give the National Audit Office unfettered access to its books, to ensure it doesn't squander funds in future. But today's revelations are unlikely to help restore confidence in the corporation's spending habits. The committee also said that the £145.50-a-year BBC licence fee should be scrapped by the end of the next decade, and replaced with a combination of a blanket household levy and a subscription fee for niche services. It also called for the abolition of the BBC Trust, the organisation's governing body, claiming it was 'too close' to the corporation and 'blurred accountability'.","Staff were paid over £228million to work unsociable and unpredictable hours .

"Former contestants of MTV's Pimp My Ride have revealed that much of the show was faked. According to the Huffington Post, many of the flashy upgrades installed by rapper Xzibit and his West Coast Customs crew didn't work, made the car worse or were simply taken out as soon as the cameras stopped rolling. The show, was enormously popular when it debuted in 2004, featured participants who had clapped out cars, which would then be repaired and 'pimped out' with new paint jobs, interiors and rims. The show also earned a reputation for its extravagant auto features such as adding pool tables, arcade machines, shoe racks, clothes dryers and chandeliers to cars. Scroll down for video .

Former contestants of the show have now revealed that many of the flashy upgrades to their cars were faked . The before shot: The van (pictured above) before it received its 'pimp my ride' treatment by the MTV show . The rear of the minivan, before and after it has had its drastic makeover. However contestants of the MTV show have said on Reddit that the many of the flashy features were unusable . However a number of former contestants revealed in separate Reddit AMA's that many of the customizations were only put in for the sake of the show. 'They actually take out a lot of the stuff that they showed on TV,' said Justin Dearinger, whose Toyota Rav4 was given 'pop-up champagne contraption' and a 'drive in theater' - both of which were taken out when the episode wrapped. He added the former was removed because they didn't want to be seen condoning drink driving; the latter because it simply wasn't road safe. The show, which debuted in 2004, typically consisted of drivers with horribly beat up cars begging the team to 'pimp their ride' The car was then taken to an auto body shop and given an extreme makeover with new paint jobs, interiors and rims . The interior of this beaten up, junk-filled SUV was refitted with red leather and TV screens in the headrests . The show also earned a reputation for its extravagant  features such as adding pool tables, arcade machines, shoe racks, clothes dryers and chandeliers to cars. Here, a jeep gets a chocolate fountain, candles and a boom box . Another contestant Seth Martino claimed he couldn't drive with the LED lights they had installed in his seat because they would get too hot. Another addition, a cotton candy machine, didn't have room for a lid, so if used the candy floss would just fly all over the place. Not what it seems: Former contestants on MTV's Pimp My Ride, hosted in the U.S. by rapper Xzibit (pictured)  have claimed much of the show was faked . 'They took the gull-wing doors off because the pistons used to lift them kept them from putting seat belts in the back, which was highly dangerous,' he said. Martino also claimed the producers just wanted to put the cotton candy machine into someone's car, and selected him because he was fat, even pouring bags of candy into his pre-pimped car. 'I know I'm fat, but they went the extra mile to make me look extra fat by telling the world that I kept candy all over my seat and floor just in case I got hungry. 'Then gave me a cotton candy machine in my trunk,' he said. 'I sat there and watched them dump out two bags of generic candy. I did not have any candy all over my car. That was completely fabricated for the story.' Seth also claimed he had to rent a car at his own expense while he waited months on the revamp; not the couple of days the shows editors had viewers believe. The contestants also revealed that much of the reaction shots - when their new pimped ride is revealed - were faked and re-shot many times. A third contestant, Jake Glazer, clearly wasn't excited enough when he had his Buick century returned. He said: 'I remember this very clearly, Big Dane, very big dude, he like puts his arm around my shoulder, kind of walks me around the shop for like 10 minutes and he's like, ""Listen, we put a lot of work into this... we expect you to be a little more f****** enthusiastic.""'

"Ryanair has been caught fooling passengers with an online competition that's impossible to win. All three potential answers in the multiple-choice promotion – which offers free flights as prizes – were incorrect. Darren Coyle, 32, discovered the blunder after paying £3.50 to play the quiz while booking flights online. He was planning a holiday to Benidorm with his friend Chris Matthews, 31, and was swayed by the chance to enter a weekly draw to win back the value of his £330 tickets. Fooled: All three potential answers in the multiple-choice promotion (inset) – which offers free flights as prizes – were incorrect as Darren Coyle (pictured), 32, discovered . But after selecting a wrong answer to the quiz question, he later discovered that his chances of picking a correct one had been zero. Ryanair asked: 'Together with the recently purchased new Boeing aircraft, how many planes will Ryanair's fleet contain in 2024?' The possible answers offered were 380, 420 or 450. Mr Coyle guessed 420, which was deemed incorrect. But when he later typed the question into Google, he found a page on the airline's website revealing that the actual answer was 520. Feeling aggrieved that he had paid £3.50 to enter an impossible quiz, Mr Coyle complained to Ryanair's head office. Bosses replied with a shame-faced letter, admitting their mistake and refunding his entrance money. Mr Coyle, who works as a plant manager, said: 'They are Con-Air. If I'd not complained they would have kept it.' The married father-of-one, from Loanhead, near Edinburgh, added: 'They are chancers. How many other people have taken a chance and ended up £3.50 down and forgotten about it?' A spokesman for the budget airline said it was investigating how a promotion without a correct answer ended up on its website. Possible scam: A spokesman for the budget airline said it was investigating how a promotion without a correct answer ended up on its website (file photo) Ironically, the blunder comes just days before Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is due to unveil its new 'passenger charter' in a bid to address its poor reputation. Pledging to improve customer service, he said: 'We were maybe a little bit cheap and nasty. We have spent a lot of time and effort trying to be cheap and a little bit better.'

"Comedy on Capitol Hill - the intentional kind, anyway - is pretty rare.

In recent days, Reid indeed has worn dark glasses in the Capitol, partly hiding the serious injury to his right eye suffered while exercising at his Nevada home on New Year's Day. Reid said an elastic exercise band snapped, causing him to fall and break bones in his face. He had two surgeries in January, including one to replace his cornea. He belatedly joined the new Congress, wearing a large bandage over his right eye and cheek. The bandage eventually gave way to dark glasses. On Thursday, Reid faced cameras in normal reading glasses, but with an opaque right lens to hide the injured eye. The extent to which Reid might recover sight in the eye won't be known for weeks, aides say.

"A woman who was left humiliated after discovering she was too fat to fit into her wedding dress is now half the woman she was -  after losing eight stone. Having found the  dress of her dreams, Vicky Jennings, 28, from Newton Abbot in Devon, was looking forward to marrying her sweetheart, Dom. But just a week before the wedding, she discovered she had gained so much weight, she struggled to fit into her dress - and was left mortified. Scroll down for video . Vicky Jennings was so mortified by her struggle to squeeze into her wedding dress, she went on to shed 8st . 'It was the week before my wedding when I went for the final fitting,' she explained. 'There were about six to eight weeks between all of the fittings and up until that point it had fitted. 'Yet on that final fitting the zip just wouldn't go any higher.' Dom and 'fat and frumpy' Vicky Jennings celebrate their wedding day . The dress was hastily let out by one inch on each side to ensure Mrs Jennings could marry in comfort. 'I had to have it taken out an inch either side, so two inches in total,' said the mother-of-two. 'The dress was already a size 20, which annoyed me anyway since I didn't believe that I was that size at all, so when they had to let it out, it was absolutely horrifying. I was mortified.' As a result, Mrs Jennings said that while most brides feel on top of the world, she walked down the aisle feeling 'fat and frumpy'. Resolving to ditch her favourite takeaway foods, chocolate and kebabs which had helped her  creep up to 16st, she pledged to lose the weight for good. 'As I got comfortable in the relationship I stopped worrying about my weight and before long the pounds piled on,' she said . 'I knew I had to do something after my wedding dress needed to be let out, but I couldn't face another crash diet that only worked for a week and left me feeling hungry.' Mrs Jennings then began her battle to beat the bulge with the help of Slimming World. She had originally piled on the pounds by eating five takeaways a week and drinking up to five cans of cola a day. 'The problem was that we didn't really cook at home. It just got to the point where we would rely on frozen meals and takeaways,' she said. 'We'd probably have five takeaways a week. My favourite food was doner kebabs. I'd have one a week. 'I also lived on cola, I'd have four or five cans of it a day. I just didn't realise how bad for you it was.' After joining her local Slimming World group, she learned how to cook healthy, fat-free meals. She has cut out the takeaways and the family now enjoys healthy home-cooked meals using fresh ingredients every night. Now the super-slimmer is a trim 8st having shed exactly half of her previous body weight in just 12 months. The mother-of-two is now a slimline size 10 and, right, is seen trying on her old size 20 jeans . The couple beam as they raise a toast at their wedding - but Vicky said she felt 'fat and frumpy' on her big day . 'It is fair to say two of me could fit into that dress now,' said a delighted Mrs Jennings, who lives with Dom in Newton Abbot, Devon. 'When I look at my wedding pictures now it feels very odd. I don't remember being like that. 'I am a completely different person now. I have changed so much and feel a lot more confident. It has been quite easy to keep the weight off. I have changed my lifestyle completely . 'As my full time job is working as a Slimming World consultant, I would have felt a bit of a fraud not keeping it off!' Since losing the weight, Mrs Jennings says she has now got more energy to run around after her two children, six-year-old Liam and Amelia, three. 'It has improved my family life immeasurably - especially with the kids,' she said. 'We have just got a puppy called Bertie, who we take out walking, and I'm able to do so much more with the kids.' 'I look forward to summer now and wearing size 10 clothes,' she added. 'I never thought I would even enter a gym, let alone enjoy personal training sessions.'","Vicky Jennings felt ashamed after her size 20 dress had to be made bigger .

"A boy with a rare medical condition that renders him unable to smile is being adopted by the kind-hearted nurse who cared for him in hospital. Three-year-old Joshua Burdell suffers from Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy - a life-limiting disease which  has left him severely disabled and unable to make facial expressions. Doctors said he would not live past a year old, and though he has proved them wrong, there is no cure for the condition, meaning his muscles will slowly degenerate and his condition will deteriorate. Joshua inherited the disease from his mother, whose disabilities meant she couldn't look after her son. Attempts to find foster parents had failed, and social workers had almost reached the point of despair, wondering how they were going to take care of him. But just as it looked as though all hope was lost, the nurse who cared for him in hospital came forward, making the brave decision to adopt him and take him home. Joshua Burdall, three, spent the first five months of his life in hospital as his mother's disabilities meant she couldn't care for him. He is being adopted by Sarah Ruane, 51, the paediatric nurse who cared for him . Joshua has Congenital Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy - a life limiting disease causes muscle wastage and degeneration - and is severely disabled . Sarah Ruane, 51, said she couldn't bear seeing him without a home. Since she became Joshua's guardian, the mother-of-six has battled endlessly trying to find a cure for his condition. After spending all of her spare time carrying out research, her hard work has won him a place on the world's first clinical trial in America, where scientists may have found a drug that could potentially cure his condition. Mrs Ruane, who is in the process of adopting Joshua, said: 'He was my patient and was born on the maternity wing at Hull Royal Infirmary (HRI). 'When he came off the wing he went to the medical ward at 10 weeks old. He never went anywhere and his address was the hospital. 'After about six days I knew I wanted to take care of him. They were struggling to get foster carers for him and I couldn't watch it anymore. 'I went into his cubicle and looked at him. The social worker said ""I don't know what we're going to do"". 'I said ""I do, I'll take him"". 'She started crying and told her manager straight away.' Joshua's condition means he is unable to smile or make other facial conditions. He also has severe learning difficulties. However he has defied original predictions that he would only live for a year . Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy is the early childhood form of myotonic dystrophy - and the symptoms are evident from birth. The rare condition, which can cause breathing difficulties for the baby shortly after delivery, can be seen if the baby appears to be 'floppy', has poor head control and lack of facial expression. Babies with the condition may also suffer from speech difficulties, and physical and intellectual milestones in the baby's development may be delayed. The disease is a genetic condition that progressively weakens and wastes the muscles. The impact of the degeneration varies significantly; some people may only find it difficult to carry out day-to-day tasks while others will have a seriously shortened life expectancy because of the condition. Mrs Ruane, who has been a paediatric nurse for 32 years, decided to find Joshua all the medical help possible and, with husband Alan, 43, a civil engineer, began caring for him. Before Mrs Ruane agreed to adopt Joshua, repeated attempts to find foster carers had failed. Now she says her whole family has fallen in love with him . Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy is the early childhood form of myotonic dystrophy,and the symptoms are evident from birth.

Babies with the condition may also suffer from speech difficulties, and physical and intellectual milestones in the baby's development may be delayed. The disease is a genetic condition that progressively weakens and wastes the muscles. Roughly 70,000 people in Britain carry the genes responsible for triggering muscular dystrophy. However, many are unaware they are ‘carriers’ of the disease where a gene spontaneously changes. The affected muscle fibres degenerate and are slowly replaced with fatty tissue. The impact of the degeneration varies significantly; some people may only find it difficult to carry out day-to-day tasks while others will have a seriously shortened life expectancy because of the condition. Sadly, congenital myotonic dystrophy can be fatal, especially in the early weeks of life. There is no cure or treatment. Source: Muscular Dystrophy Campaign . She said: 'Joshua had a feeding tube and club feet and they needed somebody with medical knowledge to take care of him. 'It was the right place at the right time. It was a split second decision. 'I came home and explained to my three grown-up children there was a little boy at work who the social workers were struggling to find a home for. They said ""why don't you bring him here?"" and I said ""It's funny you should say that"". 'Two weeks later he was moved in. I never thought of doing this. Until that day I was working full time. 'Medical specialists were shocked that I brought him home - and I will always be known as that nurse who brought the baby home. 'It's been difficult - and at times it's been heart-breaking. 'But we have all fallen in love with him. It's a nasty, progressive, awful condition. It is one of the worst conditions that I have come across.' Mrs Ruane, who now works as a children's community nurse after leaving Hull Royal Infirmary in November 2014, worked 24 hours a day researching and asking doctors for help in trying to find a cure for Joshua. Finally, she discovered researchers at Utah University were looking for 65 children from around the world to take part in the very first clinical programme to develop a new drug for children with CMD. After endless emails, she got an reply back saying they would be happy for Joshua to take part. He is the only child in the UK to take part in this programme, and the family hope it will one day lead to a cure. Mrs Ruane has carried out endless research, and eventually enrolled Joshua on to a clinical trial in America. A drugs company is testing an injection she hopes will cure Joshua's condition . Mrs Ruane said: 'We are consumed with helping him. It's funny how dependent on Josh I am now. 'He is a very happy little boy. He loves Peppa Pig and he is a total joy. 'But he is weak and he can't walk very far. One of the most difficult things for him is that it affects his facial expression. 'For him that's difficult because people think there is nobody home. 'People tend to talk over him and it's just because he can't make an expression. We have also got to be careful when he eats.' Doctors did not think Joshua would live past a year, but on his third birthday he got up and walked. Mrs Ruane said: 'It was a miracle in itself. When this came up in America I knew I needed to find out how to save him. 'I found out they were asking for children with the condition to attend the trials in Utah and I started emailing to make sure Josh was accepted. 'It's very costly and we have done it all through fundraising.' Mrs Ruane has raised £2,000 in fundraising money to take Joshua to America for the clinical trials. Over the next two years experts will monitor how his muscles are faili . Joshua's situation has already sparked donations towards the American trips, and so far Mrs Ruane has raised £2,000. She said: 'The donations have given us a chance to try and save his life. The money will get him back to America. 'Everything is a battle with Josh. As harsh as it sounds, in terms of the Government, he is not going to give anything back to society.' Mrs Ruane took Joshua for his first trip to America for the clinical trial on November 9th last year. She said: 'Joshua had a body scan, ECG of his heart, stamina test and blood and intellectual tests. We will go out again in October for the same tests and again the year after. 'The American drugs company is waiting for the data in the hope that they can find a drug. 'They have got the adult form of the drug and have started clinical trials for the child form. 'The drug will be in injection form - and the hope is it will stop the disease. 'When we are born, we have protein that is sent to muscles all over the body. 'Josh has a toxin that stops that protein spreading and it stays like a dough ball. 'The drug will split the protein and send it to the parts of the body that needs it.' Mrs Ruane and husband , said Joshua will visit Utah a further two times over the next two years where experts will monitor how his muscles are failing. She added: 'He does have some words but his mouth muscles are very weak and his tongue muscles are too. 'The way he is going he is improving but he will start to deteriorate. 'When we came back from America I felt like we had hope where there was previously none.'","Joshua Burdall inherited Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy from his mother .

"Actor Mark Rylance pictured as Thomas Cromwell in the BBC version of Wolf Hall . Viewers appear to have been less than impressed, but for the BBC's director general, Tudor epic Wolf Hall is the BBC 'at its very best'. Tony Hall, 63, gave his bold verdict as the drama's six-episode run came to an end and he added the adaptation of Hilary Mantel's bestselling book was a 'fantastic example' of 'doing things that people say ""Only the BBC could do that"".' When Wolf Hall debuted last month, it attracted 3.9million viewers, the most successful opening for a BBC2 drama in a decade. But, when the final episode hit screens on Monday, only 2.3million tuned in, meaning a third of the original audience had given up. Apart from a slight bump in the middle of the series, the show, which follows the rise of Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII, has seen a steady decline in viewers. Those who did sit through the final instalment – which closed with the execution of Henry's second wife Anne Boleyn – joked they could predict the ending, given that it is one of the most famous moments in British history. Lord Hall has always taken a keen interest in the multi-million pound project, visiting the set during production. Despite the disappointing public reaction, has stayed staunchly behind the programme. Speaking at a special screening of the final episode earlier this week, he said: 'The BBC is about one thing and one thing only, it's about the programmes and the services that give those programmes to the British public. 'That's the case for the BBC, it's as long and short as that. In Wolf Hall we have had a fantastic example of the BBC at its very best, doing things that people say, ""Only the BBC could do that"".' The director Peter Kosminsky, 58, also lavished praise on his creation but admitted that the £7million budget that has been reported was actually 'a great deal more.' The final episode saw Thomas Cromwell's schemes and manoeuvrings to remove Anne Boleyn as queen come to fruition, with her beheading freeing Henry VIII to marry again. Even though the execution is one of the most famous moments of the Tudor period, the lack of suspense did not ruin the drama for many fans. One wrote on Twitter: 'Wolf Hall, carried by Mark Rylance's excellent per-formance was very very good. Even though everyone knew the ending it was still brutal.' Despite earning the praise of BBC director general Tony Hall, the show lost 1.6million viewers during its five-week run. Pictured are Claire Foy and Damian Lewis as Anne Boleyn and King Henry VIII respectively . Another joked: 'Managed to avoid any spoilers for Wolf Hall for almost 500 years. Just need [to] see final episode without anyone ruining the ending.' Wolf Hall has been dogged by complaints throughout its run, with the concerns of viewers ranging from it being too dark, too boring and difficult to follow. Relying only on candles to illuminate some scenes, members of the audience complained at not being able to see what was happening on screen. Others found themselves unable to stick with the complex intrigues of the Tudor court. One tweeted: 'I got super bored of Wolf Hall after half an hour and turned it off, and now I'm re-arranging my sock drawer' and another added: 'Thinking about Wolf Hall; know my history, loved the books but still found the chopping and changing of the time line slightly confusing.'","Audiences appeared to be unimpressed as Wolf Hall lost 1.6m viewers .

"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, while not mentioning the Commander in Chief by name, took a shot at President Barack Obama on Thursday during a Washington, D.C. area gathering for conservatives over the Democratic leader's staunch refusal to characterize extremists in the Middle East as 'radical Islamic' terrorists. Taking his turn on the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a testing ground for Republican presidential hopefuls, Walker told the confab's attendees, the country needs a leader 'who stands up and realizes that radical Islamic terrorism is a threat to our way of life and to all freedom-loving people around the world.' 'We need a president, a leader, who will stand up and say, ""we will take the fight to them, and not wait for them to take the fight to us,"" ' Walker added. And according to Walker, he may very well be that leader, having had to take on nearly 100,000 angry union members in his first term. Scroll down for video . Wisconsin Gov.Scott Walker speaking at the 42nd annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, just down the river from Washington, D.C, said his battle with labor unions as Wisconsin's governor had given him the mettle needed to take on militant groups like Islamic State . Walker burst into the national spotlight when in his first term he took on public sector unions. His administration's reforms, backed by the state legislature, to their health and pension systems incited a recall election, which he handily won. During a question and answer portion of his session on Thursday, Walker, when asked how he would handle the conflict with ISIS if he were in charge of the military, invoked his 2012 victory over state and national unions. The likely 2016 presidential candidate, currently surging in the polls with Republican voters in early primary states, said that like most parents, he wants a Commander in Chief, 'who will do everything in their power to make sure the that threat from radical Islamic terrorists do not wash up on American soil.' Repeating his earlier statements, the father of two teenage sons said the country needs a military commander with the 'kind of confidence' to fight terrorists where they are. He then said: 'If I can do that with 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the world,' seemingly comparing critics of his policies in Wisconsin - some of whom showed up at CPAC and tried to shout him down - to violent extremists pillaging the Middle East. The Democratic National Committee immediately pounced on the remarks, contending in an email to reporters they prove the 47-year-old Republican isn't ready for prime time. 'If Scott Walker thinks that it's appropriate to compare working people speaking up for their rights to brutal terrorists, then he is even less qualified to be president than I thought,' DNC Communications Director Mo Elleithee said. 'Maybe he should go back to punting,' Elleithee added, referring to Walker's evasions in the past of questions he didn't want to answer. On one of those occasions when Walker was pressed to give his beliefs on evolution he asked his interviewer if he could 'punt' and refused to put his views on record. A spokesperson for Walker's political action committee, Leadership Matters, later told Daily Mail Online that the governor 'was in no way comparing any American citizen to ISIS.' 'Governor Walker believes our fight against ISIS is one of the most important issues our country faces,' the spokeswoman, Kristen Kukowski, said in an email. 'What the governor was saying was when faced with adversity he chooses strength and leadership. Those are the qualities we need to fix the leadership void this White House has created.' Walker was among friends and spent the bulk of his speech ticking off support for issues that are important to his base, including right to work and voter ID laws. He also slapped President Barack Obama down, though not by name, for refusing to call ISIS extremists 'radical Islamic terrorists' At Thursday's conference, surrounded conservative voters from across the country who share his values, Walker was among friends and spent the bulk of his speech ticking off support for issues that are important to his base, including right to work and voter ID laws. Walker at one point said Americans need a president 'who will stand with Israel' - another blow intended for the current occupant of the Oval Office. Like Walker, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also visiting the U.S.' Capitol City this weekend for a conference. He will make remarks at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual gathering and address a joint session of Congress while he is stateside. Obama won't meet with Netanyahu while he is in Washington, however, because he is competing to reelection later this month, and the White House worries that Obama would appear to be inappropriately influencing the contest if he were to open his arms and invite him to the White House. Walker on Thursday slammed Obama for the move, saying the country needs a leader who will show the the head of state of a longtime ally like Israel with 'respect' when he requests to visit. Technically, it was House Speaker John Boehner who invited Netanyahu to Washington. Boehner independently sent an invitation to the world leader, without the White House's knowledge, drawing ire from Democrats, dozens of whom plan to boycott his Tuesday address, during which he will make the case for additional sanctions on regional foe, Iran.","America needs a leader who 'realizes that radical Islamic terrorism is a threat to our way of life and to all freedom-loving people,' he said .
'If I can do that with 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the world,' Walker later said, seeming comparing his critics to violent extremists pillaging the Middle East .

"An elephant who was blinded in both eyes and forced to beg by her owners has been rescued by a wildlife sanctuary. Officials were forced to intervene after they discovered Lakhi was being exploited as a performer and had spiked chains around her feet to stop her escaping. The 60-year-old elephant was regularly mishandled, beaten and whipped while she was paraded around Indian towns and temples in a bid to get money for her owners. Scroll down for video . Lakhi was blinded and forced to beg by her owners in India, who put spiked chains round her feet. She was rescued (above) by Wildlife SOS yesterday . But a court order allowing a team of vets from Wildlife SOS to rescue Lakhi has finally given  her the freedom she deserves. The beautiful ellie will now start a 1,400km journey to the sanctuary's centre in Mathura, north India. She will be pampered with fresh fruit and treated to buckets of water to keep her hydrated. Wildlife SOS wrote on their Facebook page: 'It's a long journey to get there, but it's nothing compared to the hardships Lakhi has already faced. 'She is pretty smart. She picked up the smell of the bananas in the caretaker’s pocket and reached out with the help of her trunk to grab them as he closed his eyes for a little nap on the truck. 'Please consider donating to help make her future so beautiful that she almost forgets her past.' The beautiful 60-year-old ellie was forced to cross dangerous roads by her owners, despite being blind. One of her eyes, which is severely damaged, is pictured above . After being checked over by vets Lakhi starts a 1,400km journey to the sanctuary's centre in Mathura, north India . When Lakhi was discovered she had brutal injuries to her chest, forehead, ears and back, as well as damage to her feet and toenails from being forced to walk on tarmac. She also had a large lump on her head. Geeta Seshamani, co-founder of the sanctuary, said that authorities needed to be stricter about keeping elephants. She said: 'Seeing the plight of the captive elephants that we have rescued, perhaps there is a need for stricter guidelines and enforcement of guidelines or some form of checking on the welfare of elephants held in private ownership.' Wildlife SOS wrote on their Facebook page: 'She is pretty smart. She picked up the smell of the bananas in the caretaker’s pocket and reached out with the help of her trunk to grab them as he closed his eyes for a little nap on the truck' Vets and rescuers hand branches and food up to the caretaker at the top of the truck, who is in charge of feeding Lakhi . Satyajit Gujar, deputy conservator of forests in Pune, said: 'We are extremely delighted to see that Lakhi will have a better and healthier life after a lifetime of abuse.' Yaduraj Khadpekar, a senior vet at Wildlife SOS, said  Lakhi would be prone to severe foot disorders for the rest of her life due to her mistreatment. The Wildlife SOS team has also ordered ophthalmologic experts from the UK to explore the possibility of restoring vision in at least one of Lakhi's eyes. There are estimated to be around 20,000 Indian elephants left in the world.","Lakhi was forced to beg in Indian towns and temples by her owners .

"Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus on Friday characterized Democrats' top presidential contenders as either too snooty or too handsy to manage the country while addressing conservatives at their annual gabfest and jubilee. 'They've got one candidate ready to coronate herself,' Priebus said, referring to former first lady Hillary Clinton. 'And they have a sitting vice president who can't control his mouth - or his hands - who's been running for president since before I could vote.' The taunting of Biden follows an incident last week in which he got up close and personal with Defense Secretary Ash Carter's wife, Stephanie, while the new Pentagon chief was being sworn in. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus on Friday characterized Democrats' top presidential contenders as either too snooty or too handsy to manage the country while addressing conservatives at their annual gabfest and jubilee. 'They've got one candidate ready to coronate herself,' Priebus said, referring to former first lady Hillary Clinton . Disparaging Democrats' prospects of winning the presidency in 2016, Priebus said, 'they have a sitting vice president who can't control his mouth - or his hands.' Priebus' taunting of Biden follows an incident last week in which the vice president got up close and personal with Defense Secretary Ash Carter's wife, Stephanie, while the new Pentagon chief was being sworn in . Biden put his hands on Carter's shoulders, groping her while he whispered in her ear. The VP has a reputation for being flirty. A photo of him cozying up to a biker at a Ohio campaign spot went viral in 2012. He put his hands on her, too, and appeared to draw the ire of her male companions. Attempting to energize conservatives ahead of next year's national election, Priebus said the right can win if it puts in the hard work. Then 'we'll have a Republican President, and 1600 Pennsylvania avenue will never belong to the Clintons again,' he told his audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference, held just down the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. in National Harbor, Maryland. Priebus warned that at Clinton presidency would be more of the same. 'I can guarantee you America, you're not going to get something different than Obama with a member of the Obama administration,' he said. 'You're going to get a third term of Barack Obama.' To good news for Republicans, Priebus said, is the more voters hear from Hillary Clinton, the less they like her. Her approval rating was the highest when she was out of the country and off the campaign trail, he contended. 'True fact.' 'That's probably why Hillary barely comes out in public these days,' he said. 'If there's not a private luxury jet, and a quarter million dollar speaking fee waiting for her, you can forget about it.' The real reason Clinton has mostly kept out of the public eye in 2015 is because she 'doesn't have much to say,' he charged. If you ask her press people for her opinion on issues of the day such as the Keystone XL Pipeline and the fight against ISIS, they say, 'no comment,' the GOP's top tongue wager told guests of CPAC. 'I'm sure Obama wishes Biden would follow that example.' Don't tell Jill!: Vice President Joe Biden has a reputation for being flirty with women other than his wife, Jill. He's pictured here getting up close and personal with a customer at a diner while on the campaign trail in 2012 . Priebus joked today that after mixing up croute de te with an ethnic group the vice president would then 'rub your neck without permission' At that point, roughly six minutes in to his remarks, Priebus interrupted himself to say: 'Oh and by the way, If I was Hillary Clinton, this speech would have have already cost you $20,000.' Priebus used that line to launch into a lengthy parody of both Clinton and Biden. 'Hillary would never speak here,' he said. Not because she's a Democratic but because of her 'Hollywood style backstage demands' that are included in her speaking contracts. 'Well you know I checked back stage. There was insufficient croute de te, the water temperature was off by a few degrees, and I don't think that the lemon wedges were cut quite at the right angle,' he said. He then asserted that Clinton, who last year attracted negative attention for noting that her family was 'dead broke' when it left the White House, has 'lost touch' with America. Vice President Joe Biden is out of touch, Priebus said. 'If you asked Joe Biden what croute de te is, he'd probably say this: ""Oh yeah I had a great relationship with that community. There's an awful lot of them driving cabs in Delaware, for real man, they're friends of mine."" 'And then of course he'd rub your neck without permission,' Priebus added. The remarks about cab drivers was a mockery of Biden's claim last week that a 'very identifiable' community of Somalis have made his hometown, Wilmington, Delaware, their home away from home. 'If you ever come to the train station with me you’ll notice I have great relationships with them because there’s an awful lot driving cabs and are friends of mine,' Biden said while speaking at the White House's counter terror summit. 'For real. I’m not being solicitous. I’m being serious.' Hillary Clinton served as a punching bag throughout the day on Friday and speakers took turns beating her up to the delight of their conservative followers. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said she was a politician of 'yesterday.' Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said, 'It's time for Hillary Clinton to retire.' Both men are contemplating presidential campaigns and could find themselves facing off with her in a general election in 2016. Questionnaires how she would easily win against any of the possible GOP candidates, but Paul and Rubio would fare the best against her, losing by seven points a piece, according to a Public Policy Polling survey released on Friday.","'They have a sitting vice president who can't control his mouth - or his hands - who's been running for president since before I could vote'

"A pygmy possum, who chose the wrong place for a midday nap, would have awoken to the shock of her life when she realised she was more than 90km from home. The little critter was found quietly hiding in a mail bag last week by surprised mail sorter, Jack May, who had unknowingly driven it from Foul Bay to the Minlaton post office on the southern Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. After originally assuming it was a mouse, the 16-year-old soon realised that the big-eyed, curly-tailed marsupial he'd found was far more special. This full grown femal pygmy possum was found in a mail bag after choosing the spot for a nap . 'You hardly ever seen pygmy possums, they're a very secretive animal,' Deborah Furbank from Natural Resources Yorke and North told Daily Mail Australia. 'I've only ever seen them when we've done targeted trapping. You don't see them out in the wild because they hide amongst leaf litter and trees so it was definitely a special occasion. 'Down in the country, we have personal mail bags that get left in front of a property and this bag was left in a sealed drum and obviously the pygmy possum had found its way into the drum and into the bag to have a little bit of a snooze.' She was found by surprised mail sorter, Jack May, who had unknowingly driven it the 90km from Foul Bay to the Minlaton post office on the southern Yorke Peninsula in South Australia . Ms Furbank, who personally travelled to collect the full-grown female in order to have it sent back home, described it as being 'very frisky' and curious' rather than scared. 'She wasn't stressed at all. When I got hold of her to check her sex, she was completely calm,' she said. 'They're quite a docile animal, once they realise you're not a threat to their lives they relax quite quickly.' She said she collected some flowers from the bush for the possum to feed on until it was returned to its home. Once at the post office (pictured) Deborah Furbank from Natural Resources Yorke and North was called to collect and care for the possum until it could be taken back home . 'Luckily the post office staff made note of the bag it was found in so we were able to identify its territory and a staff member who lives near the property where it was collected, dropped it off on her way home,' Ms Furbank said. 'If you do find an animal, make sure to keep it somewhere dark, quiet and cool and not too look at it too much until you can call for help to get it home.' Ms Furbank said pygmy possums were similar to ring tail possums only they appear as if they have 'been put in a shrink machine'. 'They fit in the palm of your hand and are a similar size to a mouse, but plumper with larger eyes, large rounded ears and a curly ringed tail.'","A full grown female pygmy possum was found in a mail bag in South Australia where it had fallen asleep .

"The Apple Watch could replace your car keys, and will reward you throught the day for being active, Apple boss Tim Cook has revealed. He also confirmed the watch's battery will last the whole day, and will not take as long to charge as an iPhone in an interview with The Telegraph. The company has scheduled a special event on March 9, where . it will showcase the Apple Watch and that will be launched in . April, the report said. Scroll down for video . The watch is also designed to be able to replace car keys and the clumsy, large fobs that are now used by many vehicles, Cook said. He even took time out to take selfies while visiting the firm's Covent Garden store. 'This will be just like the iPhone: people wanted it and bought for a particular reason, perhaps for browsing, but then found out that they loved it for all sorts of other reasons,' Cook said. The watch is also designed to be able to replace car keys and the clumsy, large fobs that are now used by many vehicles, Cook told The Telegraph. Apple has sent out invitations for a media event in San Francisco on March 9, about one month before the much-anticipated launch of the new Apple Watch. The world's largest technology company did not specify what the event will be about in the invitation which reads simply 'Spring Forward,' a word play on the resetting of watches for daylight saving time. Chief Executive Tim Cook said last month that the company plans to launch the smartwatch in April. The Watch will operate a special rewards system: users will get credits if they exercise enough. They will also be encouraged to increase their metabolic targets if they meet their exercise targets consistently. The world's largest technology company did not specify what the event will be about in the invitation which reads simply 'Spring Forward,' a word play on the resetting of watches for daylight saving time. Earlier this month Tim Cook hit out at the sedentary lifestyle of many people, claiming that sitting is terrible for your health -and that the upcoming Apple Watch can help. While addressing a Goldman Sachs tech conference in San Francisco, the Apple CEO said 'a lot of doctors believe sitting is the new cancer.' Cook revealed he's been using his Apple smartwatch to remind him to get up and move every hour. 'If I sit for too long, it will actually tap me on the wrist to remind me to get up and move, because a lot of doctors think sitting is the new cancer,' said Cook. 'Ten minutes before the hour, it will remind you to move. We have a lot of people using the Apple Watch at Apple, and ten minutes before the hour, suddenly they all get up and move. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications . The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri is also built into the Apple Watch. 'It took a little to get used to, but it's great.' The $349 must-have gadget starts shipping in April. According to reports, Apple experimented with sensors that measured conductivity of the skin to track stress levels and monitor heart-rate, but 'these features didn't perform consistently on some people, including those with hairy arms or dry skin'. The results were also said to have varied on how tightly the watch was being worn. Cook made the announcement just as Apple became the first company to reach a market value of $700 billion. Shares rose 1.9 percent to close at $122.02, lifting Apple's market value to $710 billion, and making it the first company to hit the $700 billion milestone. Cook, speaking at the Goldman Sachs Technology & Internet Conference, said Apple was hitting its stride. 'We've taken (the mobile operating system) iOS and extended it into your car, into your home, into your health. All of these are really critical parts of your life,' Cook said. 'We want one seamless kind of life. 'And so, I think that is huge for our future...We also did a lot of things to further our global footprint. And so, if you look at what we've done in China, we've opened more stores there. 'We've opened a lot more distribution there. Through the world, we've opened almost 20,000 new points of sale. The widely anticipated first Apple 'wearable' will likely start shipping in April, Cook said . The U.S. tech giant recently posted record revenue of $74.6 billion (£49.2bn) for the three months to December 31, outstripping the quarterly GDP of Israel, Greece or Denmark. Apple's cash pile is now $178 billion (£117bn), the equivalent to $556 for every American and bigger than the £95billion budget for Britain's National Health Service. Its landmark performance was driven by record-breaking sales for its iPhone 6 and 6 plus, with the firm revealing it sold 34,000 handsets every hour for the entire quarter. 'We've opened 27 new Apple Stores, lot of flagship stores.' Cook said Apple took some $50 billion in revenue in emerging markets over the past calendar year. Brian White, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the leading tech company has even more room to grow. 'Given Apple's powerful iPhone cycle, a big 4G ramp in China and the upcoming launch of Apple Watch in April, we believe there is still plenty to look forward to at Apple during this transformational cycle,' he said in a note to clients. 'At the same time, we believe Apple's valuation has room to expand from depressed levels.' Apple shares remain valued at reasonable levels, according to analysts, because of the whopping $18 billion quarterly profit reported recently by the iPhone and iPad maker. Using the price-earnings ratio favored by Wall Street, Apple is valued at around 16 times its annual earnings, but Fitzgerald said the value was only around 10 times the projected earnings for the next fiscal year. Apple is far ahead in market value from the number two company, oil giant Exxon Mobil, worth some $382 billion at the market close. Historic first: Apple on Tuesday became the first company in history to reach a market value of $700 billion . The record Apple quarterly profit -- on unprecedented revenue of $74.6 billion -- was driven by the sale of 74.5 million iPhones, well ahead of most analysts' expectations. Analysts are also seeing expanded adoption of the Apple Pay system that enables customers to purchase items with a tap of their iPhone, and many predict strong demand for the Apple Watch set for release in April. Separately, Apple agreed to commit $848 million for solar energy to power its data centers, according to a statement from First Solar, Inc. Cook called the effort 'our biggest, boldest, and most ambitious project ever' and said it was part of Apple's commitment on clean energy and corporate responsibility.","The Apple CEO says smartwatch is set to vibrate intermittently to remind wearer to get up and move around .

"A private college at the centre of a row over bogus students has had its licence to recruit from overseas suspended by the Home Office. St Patrick’s College in London is being investigated after its publicly funded student numbers ballooned from zero to 4,000 in just one year. The students received £95.7 million in loans and grants in 2013-2014 – more than any other private college in the UK. Scroll down for video . Campus: One base of St Patrick's College in London, according to the private institution's website . It was one of a number of institutions examined by the Commons public accounts committee, which this week criticised ministers for wasting taxpayers’ money on loans to students attending colleges run by private companies or charitable institutions. The committee found more than £3 million had been paid to EU students attending British colleges who could not prove their eligibility through residency status. Other foreign students who were given funding failed to attend courses, did not complete them or could not speak the required level of English. Margaret Hodge, committee chair, said there had not been sufficient regulation of providers to protect public money. These ‘alternative providers’ have greatly expanded over the past four years, with 53,000 students claiming financial support in 2013/14 compared with 7,000 in 2010/11. Blistering: Commons public accounts committee chairman Margaret Hodge said revenue must be protected . The Home Office suspended St Patrick’s licence to recruit overseas students as investigators examine whether many were wrongly admitted. Holborn-based St Patrick’s, the UK’s largest private college, is being investigated by the Department for Business and the Quality Assurance Agency. Daniel Khan, St Patricks’ principal, said that the premises ‘are of high quality’ and that the Department for Business ‘has said that it needs to be satisfied that designation of the premises will not adversely affect the operations or processes of the college.’ He told Times Higher Education: ‘I can only imagine that this is the “investigation” you are referring to.’ Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: ‘The Government allowed private companies, that lack transparency and accountability, to profit from public subsidies without the most basic checks, and this is the completely inevitable result.’","Home Office suspends licence for St Patrick's College, Holborn, London .

"Great Britain's homes have rocketed in value by more than £1.4trillion in the last decade - despite some areas still falling into negative equity. New data, which has collated the overall worth of properties in England, Wales and Scotland, has revealed that the collective value of British homes has soared to £5.752trillion - with London seeing the greatest rise. The increase in value, spurred by the 2006 and 2007 housing boom and the more recently, the economic recovery, has not affected the whole of the UK though - as some areas including Durham and Stoke-on-Trent have experienced a sharp drop.

Map by Andrew Smith, analyst at Savills UK . The majority of growth has taken place in London, where the collective worth of homes has doubled in ten years - rising by £441billion, according to research conducted by Savills. Analysts took prices and the density of homes into account to put the data together. In stark contrast to the capital, parts of the North East have seen a sharp decline in house prices. Homes in County Durham have fallen by £2.4billion over the decade, while Middlesbrough has experienced a drop of £0.2billion. Several areas in Wales have also fallen in collective house price value including Newport, where there was a £0.2billion drop, and Blaenau Gwent, where prices fell by £0.4billion. Up-market: A row of houses in Belgravia, Westminster, where prices have soared in the last ten years . Biggest rise: Westminster in London has experienced the largest surge in house prices over the last decade with the overall property value rising by £80.8billion in ten years . A chart shows the top ten areas, by percentage, where overall house price has risen  in the last decade . The South East was one of the areas most affected by the national rise - experiencing 19 per cent of of the overall growth, amounting to £270billion. Excluding London, the highest ranking areas are dominated by those surrounding the capital, namely Epsom and Ewell in Surrey and Reigate and Banstead in East Surrey. This has been put down to commuters cashing in on London prices and selling up to move to the home counties, where they can live while still working in the capital. Experiencing boom: Hackney in North East London, pictured above, has seen a considerable rise in prices . Not far behind: The London borough of Hackney has also seen a boom, with collective prices rising by £22.8billion in the decade to 2014 . The total value in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and Humber has only risen by £42bn - amounting to just 3 per cent of overall growth in Great Britain. The growth in the total house value in London and the South East has been 12 times that of the Midlands and the North. Speaking to The Telegraph, Nigel Wilcock, regional development director at Mickledore, said: 'Economic growth has been in the larger cities, and those areas with a high proportion of public sector jobs have had a tough time. This chart shows the areas where collective house price has fallen the most as a percentage in the last decade . Decline in value: A street in Blackpool,  where collective house value fell from 2004 to 2014 . Slump: Blackpool in the North West of England has seen collective house worth drop by £1.7billion . The North East is a relatively small economy with a high reliance on the public sector. 'Therefore, while there are some individual success stories (the Nissan plant in Sunderland) the underlying trend has been relatively gloomy – depressing house prices.' In Scotland, the total housing stock in Edinburgh has leaped 33.8 per cent to £11.5billion, while Aberdeenshire, aided by the oil industry revenues, grew 58.2 per cent to £7bn over the decade to 2014.

"Sir Richard Branson has created his new brand of hotels - the first of which opened this year in Chicago - keeping the female traveller in mind. The entrepreneur has focused on the fairer sex for the Virgin Hotel in Chicago, with a bench in the shower so women can sit and shave their legs to a 'Lovers' Intimacy Kit' in the minibar. Containing condoms and sex toys, the $20 addition is one of the more unusual extras found in the room alongside the reasonably priced snacks (the hotel prides itself on charging accurate prices for food and drink). Scroll down for video . All rooms are two-room 'chambers,' with a separate dressing room and bedroom area. The compartment divider can slide across, if people require privacy when ordering room service . In order to design a hotel that would appeal to women, Virgin held focus groups with frequent female travelers asking them what was on their hotel wish lists. The responses stated they mainly wanted safety and convenience . The 26-storey, Art Deco building's rooms have also been designed with a large vanity table complete with drawers to store make-up and even a sliding compartment door with a peep hole separating the entrance and the bedroom, so guests in a state of undress can accept room service without being seen. With additional clothes hangers especially for lingerie and an app called Lucy for calling room service, the hotel certainly appears to favour the females. 'I don't think any hotel caters to the female traveller,' Branson, 64, told the Wall Street Journal. 'It will give Virgin an edge to make sure we look after them.' 'We're taking into consideration the rise of female business travellers, and appreciate what it means to our success as a brand.' Women can shave their legs on a bench in the shower for safety, (left), and do their makeup with the light of a back-lit magnifying mirror, (right) The wardrobe comes with his and hers section, complete with shoe racks and separated hangers for lingerie . The chamber is separated in two sections, separated by a sliding door, with a peep hole. This allows room service to be ordered, and modesty protected . The hotel has caused a stir for more than just its unusual mini bar offerings. When it was unveiled in January, the hotel also showcased a room key vending machine instead of a check-in desk and even free drinks at happy hour. The hospitality group, which includes everything from airplanes to mobile phone plans, has long made eliminating fees and surcharges a top priority. So it's perhaps no surprise that WiFi is free and room service is available at no additional cost. At the heart of the property is The Commons Club, a members-only inspired space where guests can drink, dine and mingle. Some of the quirky additions at the hotel are designed to make female travellers feel comfortable and offer a sense of 'fun' It's here that visitors can also take advantage of Social Hour - like happy hour, but better - where all drinks are free between 6pm and 7pm. Guests can plug their music into a USB port in the room to stream their own favourite bands, or take advantage of the free music albums on the TV, specially curated for the hotels. The hotel is located in the historic Old Dear Born Bank Building, a Chicago landmark, and offers 250 guest rooms, which start at £140. Virgin Hotels has plans to open a second location in Nashville in summer 2016 and a third property in New York City in the fall of 2017, with 20 locations by 2025. 'Chicago is an exhilarating and historic city, and a place we're happy to call home for the first-ever Virgin Hotel,' said Raul Leal, CEO of Virgin Hotels. 'It's an exciting time for our team as we get to unveil our new approach to room design, service, and entertainment within the hotel industry. The hotel is not the only one to offer intimate toys up to its guests. The Drake Hotel in Canada provides a pleasure menu, alongside the standard room service. And Ushuaia, the celebrity-filled party hotel in Ibiza, comes with its own erotic kits in rooms, complete with silk handcuffs. The innovative hotel does not have a front check-in desk. Computer screens sitting atop a former cigar bar (the prior tenant was a 1920s bank) where you can access your reservation profile and check-in . 'Chicago is an exhilarating and historic city, and a place we're happy to call home for the first-ever Virgin Hotel,' said Raul Leal, CEO of Virgin Hotels . The Commons Club, a members-only inspired space, offers Social Hour daily, with free drinks from 6-7pm . A 2011 report from the Center for Hospitality Research at Cornell University stated that while females accounted for only a quarter of business travelers in 1991, they now comprise about half, an opportunity Virgin Hotels is keen to reflect in its rooms . The property, at 203 N. Wabash in the Loop, is the first of three planned for the US. Two hotels are being developed in New York and Nashville .","The first of 20 planned Virgin Hotel properties opened in Chicago in January, with some unusual additions .

"A rural Christian college has banned homosexuality after two of the school's volleyball players came out as gay. Erskine College in Due West, South Carolina, said that homosexuality wasn't part of 'God's intended design for humanity'. The liberal arts school with 575 students is affiliated with the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. This week, the college issued a 'Statement on Human Sexuality', saying it intended to 'add the statement to its official manuals and determine how it will be integrated into campus culture and procedures'. Open: Erkine College students Juan Varona (left) and Drew Davis (right) recently publicly acknowledged they were both gay, sparking some media attention that angered local Christian groups . 'We believe the Bible teaches that all sexual activity outside the covenant of marriage is sinful and therefore ultimately destructive to the parties involved,' part of the statement read, according to OutSports.com. The statement comes after two students, Drew Davis and Juan Varona - both players on the Div. II Erskine College men's volleyball team - publicly acknowledged they are gay. However, both of them say they have received nothing but support and encouraged from their peers following the admissions. Both Davis and Varona - who grew up near San Juan in Puerto Rico - admitted they were worried how others would take their sexuality, but say they have been embraced, especially by his teammates, whom he describes as 'like brothers'. Statement: The school says it intends to ' add this to official manuals and determine how it will be integrated into campus culture and procedures' 'At first I didn't know how they were going to take it because I'm not from this country,' Varona told OutSports. 'But everybody has been great. 'I've even had baseball players come up to me and say they were homophobic until they met me. 'I guess they look at my personality more than whether I'm gay or not.' It is for that reason Varona was shocked to learn of the statement his school had put out. 'The release of this statement makes me disappointed because I have never received anything but kind treatment from everyone at this school, and my sexual orientation is no secret,' he said. 'So it took me by surprise. 'I feel that in the time that we are living right now, where even in the conservative state of South Carolina same-sex marriage is legal, the school took several steps back instead of progressing towards a future where everyone can be treated as an equal, which is a future most of the country is moving towards. 'I understand the religious stand on adultery, which is part of the Ten Commandments in the Bible, and that would apply to heterosexual and homosexual people. 'But when I saw the mention of sexual orientation being an issue, it just made me sad and worried for other gay people who might be struggling with confidence to come out.' A Christian website, ARPTalk, recently called upon the college to address the fact it had two gay students, after news of Davis and Varona's coming out sparked some media attention. 'With the “outing” of two gay student-athletes on the internet, the gay and lesbian issue is now front-and-center at Erskine College,' the site editor, Charles W. Wilson, posted online. 'Do Acting President Brad Christie and his administrators, staff, and faculty have the Biblical convictions, understanding, and rectitude to competently and Christianly address the gay and lesbian issue at Erskine?'
