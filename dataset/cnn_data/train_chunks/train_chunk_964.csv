"Nigel Pearson believes that his Leicester stars will catch the attention of their international bosses if they carry on their excellent start to the season for the Foxes. Striker Jamie Vardy was linked with an England call-up for their Euro 2016 qualifiers this month after his fine start to the season. Vardy scored in the 5-3 win over Manchester United and Three Lions assistant manager Ray Lewington watched the 27-year-old in the Foxes' 2-0 defeat at Crystal Palace last week. Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy was linked with a call-up to the England squad . And boss Nigel Pearson believes his players will continue to gain recognition if they keep playing well . Vardy, who was playing for Stocksbridge in the eighth tier of English football four years ago, missed out on selection for the games with San Marino and Estonia but, ahead of Saturday's visit of Burnley, Pearson believes rewards will come if his players perform. 'My views on any player who has been linked with international call-ups is that it is pretty positive but if people are still talking about any of our players at the turn of the new year then they have continued to do well,' he said. 'It is easy to get carried away with one or two performances but ultimately it is about players being able to perform consistently for their clubs. If they do that than any speculation regarding their futures at international level will take care of themselves. Vardy celebrates after putting Leicester ahead against Manchester United in their famous 4-3 win . Vardy (left) battles with Crystal Palace's Joel Ward during their 2-0 defeat last weekend . 'For anyone to be linked with an international is a positive, although I wonder where the speculation is generated.

"Safe passage: Switzerland has revealed it would shield Edward Snowden from extradition to the U.S. Switzerland would shield NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden from extradition to the U.S. should he agree to assist the country with an investigation into American spying, it has been revealed. The former intelligence contractor could be granted safe passage to travel to Switzerland without fear of being handed over to the U.S., according to a leaked document drawn up by the Swiss public prosecutor's office that outlines the country's legal options were Snowden to visit. The 'purely hypothetical' situation relies on Snowden agreeing to cooperate with a Swiss criminal investigation into U.S. spying activities he claims to have learned about while working in Geneva. According to the document, which first leaked last week but was shown to the Reuters news agency by the Swiss prosecutor's office today, Snowden would probably not be extradited to the United States if Washington asked. It explains that Switzerland could not comply with the request if Snowden is accused of treason or divulging state secrets, because such charges have a 'political character' under Swiss law. The guarantee for Snowden's free passage in Switzerland could only be trumped by 'higher state obligations' such as a treaty, the document said - adding that this area required further study. Upon showing the document to Reuters, the prosecutor's office stressed the issue was 'purely hypothetical' because . Snowden had not been invited to come from his current refuge in . Russia. The office refused to make any further comment on the document, which was leaked last week and prompted a lively . debate in the Swiss media. Marcel Bosonnet, Snowden's lawyer in Switzerland, did not comment on the document. Tension: The leaked public prosecutor's office document could spark a clash between the respective presidents of Switzerland and the U.S., Didier Burkhalter (left) and Barack Obama (right) Although Snowden is likely to be granted safe passage should he travel to Switzerland, his chances of political asylum there are low as he has already been given a three-year residency in Russia. The decision on whether to grant Snowden asylum in Switzerland ultimately lies with the government and with justice officials. Snowden worked as a computer technician for the CIA in the U.S. mission to the United Nations in . Geneva between 2007 and 2009. He has previously stated that he had a 'formative' experience in the Swiss city when the CIA deliberately got a . Swiss banker drunk and encouraged him to drive home. When he was arrested, a CIA operative offered to intervene . and later recruited the banker, Snowden has claimed. Some Swiss . officials have questioned if the incident ever happened. Split: Snowden is a hugely divisive figure in the U.S., with many arguing his whistleblowing risked lives. Others, such as the anti-NSA protesters pictured, claim he was right to reveal the extent of state surveillance . Discussion of Snowden's potential movement outside Russia has not been limited to Switzerland. Some German politicians have suggested inviting him to the country to testify about NSA spying there, . but Berlin has already ruled that out to avoid a clash with Washington . over his extradition. Michael McCaul, Republican head of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security, reacted angrily to the Swiss debate over Snowden's future. He told the U.S.-based Foreign Policy magazine . that Snowden should not be allowed to 'trade our intelligence . community's sources and methods for safe haven in other . countries'.","Switzerland would protect Snowden from U.S. if he assists spy investigation .

"Australian Federal Police have posted a humorous post on their official Facebook page, updating the public on a drug bust by using cringeworthy fish puns. AFP have written about an arrest in Sydney last week, in which two men were arrested for trying to import $75 million worth of drugs into Sydney hidden underneath frozen fish.

A little bit fishy: The Australian Federal Police posted this hilarious facebook post on Monday - using the terrible 'Dad jokes' such as 'they didn't mullet over' in relation to a drug bust in which the drugs were found hidden underneath frozen fish . Two men have been arrested after attempting to import 88kg of heroin and 21kg of methamphetamines into Sydney in a frozen fish shipment . However, some commenters have taken offence to the light-hearted post, telling AFP to scale back on their use of puns.

"Swansea manager Garry Monk has accused television of adding to Alan Pardew's misery at Stoke on Monday night, claiming there was an agenda against the under-fire Newcastle boss. Pardew will be in the spotlight at Swansea again on Saturday with Newcastle one place off the bottom of the  Premier League and his job said to be still very much in the balance. The Newcastle manager's job prospects looked bleak after Monday's 1-0 defeat to the Potters, but Pardew remains in charge for the trip to south Wales and Swansea counterpart Monk admitted he felt sympathy for him while watching the game on television at home. Alan Pardew has endured a torrid time of late but Swansea boss Garry Monk has backed the Newcastle gaffer . Monk believes the television coverage of Newcastle's defeat by Stoke was not fair to Pardew . 'I don't like seeing the agenda in the televised game at Stoke the other night,' Monk said. 'Every time there was a bad mistake or some sort of attack against Newcastle they'd pan to the manager and the chairman. 'It was a bit of a farce for me and I thought there was an agenda behind it. 'But Alan's an experienced manager, he's in a difficult moment and he's been through the mill but he's a very good manager. 'He's got a very talented squad of players and it's a case of pulling together as quickly as possible and move on. Newcastle supporters held numerous banners calling for Pardew to be sacked during the 1-0 defeat at Stoke . 'You have sympathy with all managers in those situations but with the players they have they'll fight and scrap for every point and I think they'll do well this season.' Swansea were boosted on Thursday by Jonjo Shelvey being called into the England squad for the forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia, the 22-year-old midfielder having won his solitary cap two years ago while he was a Liverpool player. Shelvey's inclusion marks the first time that a player has been named in an England squad while representing Swansea, and Monk said it was a huge boost for the club even if highly-rated wide men Nathan Dyer and Wayne Routledge missed out on a place in Roy Hodgson's squad. Magpies owner Mike Ashley reportedly told a journalist Pardew would be sacked if Newcastle lost at Stoke . 'It's excellent news for the player and for the club,' Monk said. 'It's a great example, a way of showing a pathway to international teams. 'We have a lot of international players but in terms of England it's a pathway for others here. 'We've worked hard with Jonjo, how he can contribute and improve and he's making a conscious effort to do that. 'He's not quite all the way there yet but he's improving and this will give him another boost in confidence. Monk hailed midfielder Jonjo Shelvey, who was called up to the England squad by Roy Hodgson on Thursday . 'His quality is there for everyone to see - his passing, the way he moves the ball, how he offers good angles and movements and fits into a defensive shape. 'I hope it opens the door for others.' Swansea's confidence levels are at the opposite end to Newcastle as they lie fifth in the league table following last weekend's goalless draw at Sunderland. But Monk insists they can do even better after what has been an impressive start to the season. 'I know what the players can do and we've been working very hard putting stuff into place,' Monk said. 'Where we are now is at a good level but we can show more. 'As a whole over all the games we can be better and that's what we're all striving for.'","Swansea boss Garry Monk says the television coverage of Newcastle's 1-0 defeat by Stoke on Monday was unfair to Alan Pardew .

"When Matt the Cat was found abandoned in a box on the side of the road in July - he was too sick to eat, and his fur was so long that it required emergency surgery to shear it all off. The neglected moggy, found on Kilburn High Road, north London, was rushed to the nearby Well Animal Clinic where vets set about removing his horrendously matted coat. They also had to fix his broken jaw and remove most of his teeth as they were badly rotted away - but the animal has since made a full recovery and been adopted by the clinic's vet, who calls him a 'celebrity at the practice'. Scroll down for video . Groggy: Matt recovers on the operating table as vets at Well Animal Clinic in West Hampstead, north west London, jokingly shaped the shaven coat into a furry animal . Vets sedated the Persian cat and set about the task of shearing him like a sheep with clippers - removing so much fur it filled two plastic bags. Unrecognisable from the animal that was rushed in, the moggy was captured groggily awakening on the operating table, next to a huge ball of fur, which vets jokingly heaped into a ball and gave eyes. After bravely pulling through, Matt was nursed back to health by the team at Well Animal Clinic in West Hampstead, north west London. His coat will take a few months to regrow so he has been wearing a jumper knitted for him by the mother of one of the practice's receptionists. And rather than being rehomed, Matt has been adopted by vet Christian Le Van and his family, who live above the surgery. Close shave: The moggy is barely recognisable from the cat that was rushed into surgery and he is now said to be on the mend after having life-saving surgery . Neglected: Matt's fur had become horribly matted after years living rough - the unfortunate cat also needed most of his teeth pulled out as they had rotted away . Christian, 38, said: 'Matt arrived at our practice a couple of months ago in a terrible state. He had been rescued by the RSPCA after being abandoned in a box on Kilburn High Road. 'His fur was so matted he couldn't do anything and his teeth were so rotted his jaw had fractured. He could barely eat or drink. 'He was really dehydrated and full of infection, and just in a horrendous condition. He could have died if he hadn't have been found. Recovering: Matt's appearance is slightly alarming because vets had to give him such a close shave - to keep him warm they knitted him a jumper (right) 'We anaesthetised him and shaved off all his fur. I had to pull out most of his teeth because they were so rotten and then I wired his lower jaw back together. 'It was touch and go at that point. Matt needed intensive care and had to be fed through a syringe so we kept him in for a few weeks. 'In the end my wife and I decided to keep him ourselves. We already have three cats so it was no bother to us. Almost there: Vet Christian Le Van said 'It was touch and go - Matt needed intensive care and had to be fed through a syringe so we kept him in for a few weeks' Happy again: After making a big impression, the resilient cat has now been adopted by vet Christian Le Van and his family, who live above the surgery . 'It was then just a case of slowly nursing him back to health with good food and lots of rest. 'The transformation has been amazing - in the last month or so his character has started to come out and he's getting much more bold. 'He's become a real celebrity at the practice. It will take about three more months before his hair is fully regrown again but he's doing ok considering we shaved him bald. Job done: Veterinary workers, Susan Hayden and Lauren Parker, pose with Matt after his successful surgery at the Well Animal Clinic in north west London . 'The mother of one of our receptionists knitted him a little jumper to keep him warm in the meantime, and it's noticeable how much happier he is with it on. 'Matt looks comical and his story has had a happy ending but behind it all there's quite a serious case of neglect. 'We have to thank the RSPCA who brought Matt to us after rescuing him. They work very closely with them and they do fantastic work in our area.' Celebrity cat: Matt, pictured in a jumper knitted by the practice receptionist's mother,  has become extremely bold and is treated like a celebrity at the clinic .","Moggy was found abandoned in box on side of road in July with horrendously matted fur and teeth rotting away .

"With an increasing number of families and unaccompanied children pouring across the border, it has become one of America's most pressing issues. Now, a survey has revealed the town which plays host to the most immigrants in every U.S. state.

In New York, a fewer 47.1 per cent of locals in Spring Valley are foreign-born - the highest number in the state. But at the other end of the spectrum, only 4.7 per cent of people in Bigfork, Montana, are immigrants. The research, carried out by Business Insider, looked at towns, cities and villages with at least 1,000-strong populations using estimates from the 2008-2012 American Community Survey. Fewer: In New York, 47.1 per cent of locals in Spring Valley (pictured) are foreign-born - the highest in the state . But at the other end of the spectrum, only 4.7 per cent of people in Bigfork (pictured), Montana, are immigrants . Unsurprisingly, Latin America was found to be the most common birthplace among immigrants. It comes just days after it emerged that President Barack Obama is on pace  to deport the fewest number of immigrants since at least 2007. According to an analysis of Homeland Security Department figures by The Associated Press, the federal agency responsible for deportations sent home 258,608 immigrants between the start of the budget year last October and July 28 this summer. During the same period a year earlier, it removed 320,167 people — meaning this year saw a decrease in deportations by nearly 20 percent. Reduced numbers: It comes just days after it emerged that President Barack Obama (pictured) is on pace to deport the fewest number of immigrants since at least 2007 . The figures, contained in weekly internal reports marked 'Official Use Only,' reflect the marked decline in deportations, while Mr Obama has delayed announcing what changes he will make to U.S. immigration policies through executive action. The President said he would act before the end of the summer, but White House officials said last weekend that he would postpone his decision until after November's elections. The announcement came much to the chagrin of Latino leaders; many of whom believe Mr Obama's deported too many immigrants . Since taking office, Mr Obama's administration has removed more than 2.1 million immigrants from the country. Springwater, Florida - 74.4 . Langley Park, Maryland - 67.6 .

"An investigation into the deaths of five cancer patients has found the surgeons involved were ‘dysfunctional’ and ‘secretive’. Keyhole surgery for stomach and throat cancer was only stopped at Maidstone Hospital in Kent last July, despite whistleblowers raising concerns about patient care three years ago. A report by the Royal College of Surgeons, carried out five months ago, was made public this week after complaints of a cover-up from the dead patients’ families. Keyhole surgery for stomach and throat cancer was only stopped at Maidstone Hospital in Kent last July, despite whistleblowers raising concerns about patient care three years ago . Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust admitted potentially avoidable complications could have contributed to the five deaths between 2012 and 2013. Three surgeons, Professor Amir Nisar, Haythem Ali and Ahmed Hamouda, were barred from carrying out the procedures, but all have been allowed to continue doing general surgery. The report says the team was ‘dysfunctional’, their working practices were ‘secretive’, and they had a ‘difficult’ relationship with anaesthetists. It found there was a high rate of complications associated with the keyhole techniques, and that aftercare for patients was poor. Dr Paul Sigston, medical director of Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, said: ‘I would again like to apologise to the families involved.’ Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust admitted potentially avoidable complications could have contributed to the five deaths between 2012 and 2013 (file picture)","Findings revealed after investigation into deaths of five cancer patients .

"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, has pleaded not guilty to taking part in the 2013 Boston bombings. He could face the death penalty . Attorneys for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on Monday denied as 'false' and 'preposterous' an allegation that defense team members posed as FBI employees while investigating the case in Russia. 'Let us be clear: at no time have members of the defense team misrepresented themselves or lied about their work,' the defense attorneys said in a court filing. They also said trying to get information in a country where people are suspicious of appointed defense lawyers, the defense team already has a difficult job persuading potential witnesses it is working to protect Tsarnaev 'rather than facilitating the U.S. government's effort to execute him'. Tsarnaev, 21, has pleaded not guilty to participating with his now-deceased brother Tamerlan in the 2013 bombings that killed three people and injured about 260 others. He could face the death penalty. He is a naturalized U.S. citizen who came to the Boston area with his family more than a decade ago. His parents have returned to Russia. Prosecutors said the allegation came in an official communication from the Russian government, which expelled the three individuals. Prosecutors cited it in a court filing on Friday opposing a defense request to delay Tsarnaev's November 3 trial, saying the preparation work load cited by the defense is largely self-inflicted. Defense attorneys said that by repeating 'reckless allegations' prosecutors are likely making it more difficult for them to prepare on time. They pleaded again for a delay. 'More time is needed to ensure basic fairness to the accused. It is also needed to service society's best interest in the fullest possible accounting of what happened in Boston during the week of April 15, 2013, and why it happened,' the lawyers said. Prosecutors noted in their legal brief that three members of Tsarnaev's legal team were recently expelled from Russia after misrepresenting themselves as tourists to local authorities. 'While conducting interviews in Russia, the members of the defense team reportedly refused to produce documents confirming their legal status and identified themselves as employees of the FBI,' the brief states. 'As a result, the Russian government found that the defense team members had violated the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation and expelled them.'

"Romania coach Victor Piturca has jumped to the defence of Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches in the wake of criticism from fans and the media following some poor performances for his club in recent weeks. The defender's error gifted Besiktas a last-gasp equaliser in a 1-1 Europa League draw on Thursday and the Romanian was panned for a woeful performance against West Bromwich Albion in his last league appearance two weeks ago. 'Well, he has made some mistakes but it's normal to make mistakes and we shouldn't dramatise it,' Piturca told reporters on Tuesday, four days ahead of an eagerly anticipated Euro 2016 qualifier against neighbours Hungary. Vlad Chiriches (second right, No 6) protests after he gave away a penalty that led to Besiktas' equaliser . 'We should not put him against the wall.' Romania, who failed to qualify for the Euro 2012 finals, began their Group F campaign with a 1-0 win at Greece with Ciprian Marica scoring an early penalty. 'What matters now is what we do against Hungary,' added Piturca, who included eight players from Romanian champions Steaua Bucharest in his squad for qualifiers against the Hungarians and away to Finland next Tuesday. Following the back-to-back underwhelming displays, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino dropped Chiriches from the squad for the 1-0 league win over Southampton on Sunday. Chiriches was dropped from Tottenham's starting XI for their win over Southampton on Sunday . 'I don't care what Chiriches did at Tottenham,' Piturca, who is expected to join Al Ittihad later this month after holding talks with the Saudi Arabian club, said. 'What interests me is that he plays very well for the national team.' Local media said that Piturca may even consider giving the 24-year-old Chiriches the captain's armband to boost his morale with regular skipper Marica suspended after being sent off in the Greece win. Romania manager Victor Piturca may even consider handing the captain's armband to the Spurs man . 'The coach knows what to do very well,' Chiriches said. 'I'm not thinking who will be the captain. I'm only thinking about my progress and my performance on the field.'

"Ally McCoist today insisted his job is not 'bombproof' as he dismissed suggestions Rangers' desperate financial position is the only thing preventing him from being sacked. But he did admit he will accept any road back to Scotland's top flight - even if it means using the play-offs to finally reclaim the Ibrox side's Premiership place. McCoist has come under a wave of flak from supporters since Monday's dismal 3-1 defeat to Hibernian. Ally McCoist claims that no manager is completely safe from losing his job . Sections of the Ibrox faithful jeered their team after the shock 3-1 home defeat to Hibernian . His team have already lost at home to Hearts this season and now trail their Scottish Championship rivals by six points. But the Light Blues boss hit back at claims the hefty settlement package he would be due as part of his £400,000-a-year contract had made the Ibrox board think twice about handing him his P45. Rangers were forced to launch an emergency share issue last month in order to pay September's wages and will have to do the same again before the year is out. 'I don't think anyone is bombproof,' said McCoist. 'I wouldn't sit here for a minute and say I'm bombproof. I'm still wearing the flak jacket but nobody is bombproof.' Lee McCulloch (L) and Nicky Law walk off dejected after being beaten 3-1 by Hibs at home . Asked if he would consider quitting if he lost the support of the Gers faithful, McCoist replied: 'That's a hypothetical question which I wouldn't answer.' Neither did the club's all-time record goalscorer let himself be riled by the barrage of complaints which have poured in his direction since losing to Alan Stubbs' men. Former Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart even claimed in a national newspaper column this week that McCoist was failing as a manager by not training his players properly. But the Ibrox boss said: 'I will tell you the truth, I genuinely don't care about the criticism and I'll tell you why. If Walter Smith can get stick here winning nine (SPL titles) in a row and getting to the UEFA Cup final, then it's fair to say I will receive a certain degree of criticism. 'I respect everyone's opinion but I don't necessarily agree with it. I'm always under pressure. I have never felt under more pressure or any less pressure. I just want to get the job done.' Hibernian star Jason Cummings celebrates his second goal in front of the Rangers fans . Monday's display may have been woeful but Rangers still sit second in the promotion battle. With three further matches against Robbie Neilson's unbeaten Gorgie troops to come, the League One champions could yet fight their way back into contention. But McCoist claims he would take promotion by the play-off back door if his side fail to reign in their title rivals. 'Relying on the play-offs is not out of the question because getting out of the division is the most important thing,' he said ahead of Saturday's trip to Livingston. 'We will take whatever we can to get out of this division because it is so important for the club to get back into the top flight as soon as possible.' Rangers will head along the M8 to the Energy Assets Arena without defender Bilel Mohsni after he was given a three-game ban for lashing out at Hibs defender Liam Fontaine in the seconds after Nicky Law had struck the hosts' consolation effort. Rangers will be without Bilel Mohsni (R) at the weekend after he was banned for lashing out at Liam Fontaine . It was the Tunisian's second moment of madness in little more than three months after he headbutted Derby's Chris Martin during a pre-season friendly. But McCoist insists Monday's incident came after his player was provoked. 'He should not have reacted when the Hibs player punched the ball out of his hands and grabbed him round the waist,' said the boss, who admits he is also 'hopeful' that Kris Boyd will win his appeal after he was charged with headbutting Jordan Foster. 'But I don't think there is any doubt he was provoked. 'He has let himself down a couple of times recently, particularly at Derby, but I have got more sympathy for him from Monday's incident than I did at Derby.' Meanwhile, McCoist believes Rangers should take any investment made available to them - including from Mike Ashley. The Newcastle United owner splashed out £850,000 on Tuesday as he doubled his Ibrox stake to 8.92 per cent by buying four million existing shares from investment group Hargreave Hale. Ally McCoist would give the thumbs up to any investment, including that from Newcastle owner Mike Ashley . But the Sports Direct tycoon's purchase came just weeks after he snubbed the opportunity to invest directly in the club when it put 15million fresh stocks up for sale. McCoist, however, said: 'It's fair to say we could do with investment. It's not my job to get that investment but with my manager's hat on I would gladly hope we can get investment from whatever quarter. 'I don't know the ins or outs of the shares being bought this week but all I would say is that we definitely, definitely will need investment.'","Rangers manager Ally McCoist insists he is not 'bombproof' from the sack .

"West Ham midfielder Stewart Downing was feeling optimistic about the club's chances of finishing in the Barclays Premier League top 10 this season after the 2-0 victory over rock-bottom QPR. The win, secured by a fifth-minute Nedum Onuoha own-goal and Diafra Sakho's header just before the hour mark, saw the Hammers rise to seventh place in the table. Downing provided the corner from which the ball appeared to strike Enner Valencia's hand before bouncing in off Onuoha. VIDEO Scroll down for Sam Allardyce's post-match comments .

Things have gone against us in the past but we got one today. 'If we consistently perform like we did against Liverpool (a 3-1 victory) and we did today, then we have a hell of a chance of being inside the top 10, if not further up.

"Wire-free pacemakers the size of a pill have been fitted in British patients for the first time. The operations have been described  as a ‘milestone moment’ that could  revolutionise the treatment of heart rhythm problems and cut the risks linked to traditional pacemakers. The new pacemaker, a tenth of the size of current devices, is the smallest in the world and is tucked inside the heart itself via a catheter. Revolution: The new wireless pacemaker has been fitted on two men at Southampton General Hospital . As it is self-contained, it dispenses with wiring into the heart needed by normal pacemakers, which often breaks and means the patient’s chest has to be opened again. And, as the surgery involved with the new device is minimal, it should reduce the danger of potentially lethal infections developing, and the patient’s recovery time is rapid. Professor John Morgan, who operated at Southampton General Hospital on a man in his early 20s and one in his mid 60s, said that while the existing technology is ‘fantastic’ and has ‘saved countless lives’, it has its drawbacks. Pacemakers regulate the heart’s rhythm and are implanted in more than 40,000 patients in England each year. Although they have been getting smaller in recent years – the first to be implanted, in the 1950s, were the size of a small tin of shoe polish – they are still too big to be placed inside the heart itself and so are put in the upper chest. New life: Student Thomas Perris, 21, from Southampton, was one of the two British patients who received the smallest pacemaker in the UK . This involves a wound up to 2in across. The pacemaker is then connected to the heart via wires, but these can be pulled out of place or snap over time. This happens in more than one in 100 cases and means the patient will have to have a second, more complicated, operation. In contrast, the new device, called the Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, is small enough to be ferried into the heart via a catheter that is passed up through the groin. And, because it is placed in the heart, there are no wires to be attached. Professor Morgan, who also holds an honorary post at Southampton University, said: ‘While pacemakers have saved countless thousands of lives over the past seven decades since the first devices were implanted, one of the major drawbacks has been complications related to the pacing lead that is put in to deliver electrical impulses to the heart. ‘This is a big step forward in patient treatment and a milestone for cardiac rhythm management in the UK.’- Professor John Morgan . ‘Now we have pacemakers that are so small - not much larger than an antibiotic pill - they can be attached directly to the inside of the heart, all the problems related to the old-fashioned pacemaker lead are abolished.’ The simpler operation takes as little as ten minutes and patients can get back to normal in just two to three days, compared with six weeks currently. Student Thomas Perris, who had a very slow heartbeat that was sapping his energy, opted for the new device because he did not want to be left with a large scar on his chest at the age of 21. Mr Perris, of Southampton, said: ‘Every time I stood up, I was dizzy and light-headed. Now I’m a lot happier.’ The Southampton operations are part of a Europe-wide trial of one of three miniature, wireless pacemakers that are in development. The device, made by US firm Medtronic, could be suitable for around a third of pacemaker operations. Professor Morgan said: ‘This is a big step forward in patient treatment and a milestone for cardiac rhythm management in the UK.’ Thembi Nkala, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘There has been an impressive evolution in pacemaker design and efficiency over the years. ‘This new development promises to be more remarkable as it is wireless, minimally invasive and carries fewer complications. ‘However, it’s important that we patiently await the completion of this study before this novel device is considered for general public use.’","Wireless pacemaker fitted on two patients in the UK .

"Goalkeeper Petr Cech seems content that he is to remain a Chelsea player at least until January after staying put on transfer deadline day. Queens Park Rangers had been offered Cech by Chelsea, but the goalkeeper, who has lost his place at Stamford Bridge to Thibaut Courtois, was believed to favour a move to a London club. He will remain at Chelsea in his 11th season at the club. He Tweeted: 'Blue is the colour ! "" ... It hasn't changed... ;-) have a good night everyone.' Chelsea did not wish to let him join a rival, in either the Premier League or Europe, but were keen to treat their legendary goalkeeper with respect. Bags packed: Petr Cech (left) looked set to leave Chelsea on transfer deadline day, but nothing materialised . Embarrassment of riches: Cech (right) has lost his place in the Chelsea team to Thibaut Courtois (left) Cech would initially give little away when questioned about his future on Monday, however. 'I've been at the club for 10 years, the situation is now new to me,' he told sport.cz. 'The three opening matches I could not play for the team. I have no reason to panic, pack up and leave. 'I am a Chelsea player, where I have two more years of contract. 'In football, nothing can be predicted in advance, nothing is ever perfect. 'A lot of players go on representative duty, yet still many transfer clubs. Bright future: QPR have already signed England Under 21 keeper Alex McCarthy from Reading for £6million . Legend: Cech has gone down in history at Stamford Bridge after a glittering career with Chelsea . Appearances: 477 . Clean sheets: 220 . Trophies: . 1x Champions League . 1x Europa League . 3x Premier League . 4x FA Cup . 2x League Cup . 2x Community shield . 'The offer would have to be right for everyone. I do not exclude anything (or) know the answer.' QPR have already signed Alex McCarthy from Reading for £6million and Robert Green is their first choice. They recently allowed Brazilian World Cup goalkeeper Julio Cesar to leave for Benfica. It is believed that Cech was offered to QPR last week, ahead of them completing the signing of McCarthy from Championship club Reading. Paris Saint-Germain could still test Cech's resolve to stay in England in January. PSG were ruled to have breached the rules last season and have been forced to limit transfer expenditure, meaning a loan deal could be possible. PSG see Cech as the ideal man to help them win the Champions League, deeming him better than current No 1, Italian Salvatore Sirigu, and would have no problem matching his wages.","Cech Tweeted: 'Blue is the colour !

"Nathaniel Clyne is one of the best right-backs Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has ever coached. Calls are growing for the highly-talented 23-year-old to follow in the footsteps of Saints team-mates past and present by getting England recognition. Clyne has improved markedly since arriving at St Mary's in 2012, and has been a key component in what has been the Premier League's tightest defence this term. Nathaniel Clyne scored a long-range effort for Southampton against Arsenal in the Capital One Cup . Clyne (centre) celebrates with team-mates after his wonder strike for the Saints at the Emirates . Ronald Koeman has praised full-back Clyne . Saints boss Koeman knows a thing or two about defending himself and has seen few better than the former Crystal Palace full-back. 'In my opinion, Clyne is one of the best right full-backs that I've had in my teams during the last 15 years,' he said. 'That means a lot because I like to play with offensive right and left full-backs and he has that qualities, he's fast and gives good crosses. 'I'm happy but I'm not in the position to tell the national coach of somebody else about him. 'He shows his quality from the beginning of the season and if he continues like that he will get a call, for sure. 'If he shows his qualities game by game, then I'm sure he will get finally a call to be a national player.' Clyne and his team-mates have conceded just three top-flight goals so far this term and head into this weekend's clash with QPR second in the Premier League. Clyne (right) battles with Francis Coquelin during Southampton's match against Arsenal . Only Chelsea are above Saints and, despite them having conceded seven goals, Koeman pointed to Jose Mourinho as the mentality to replicate. 'To win points, to win games, it starts at the back,' he said. 'It starts in the defence. 'That's the reason that we bought Fraser Forster because he is a fantastic goalkeeper with a future in the club. 'We have a strong defence. It's all about organisation in the team and one time a week we do unit training. We make three groups and we have training for the defenders, for midfielders and for forwards. 'That is an example of how we try to do work the whole week. Building a house you don't start at the top, you start at the bottom. That makes winning teams. Clyne (right) first impressed while at Crystal Palace - pictured battling Birmingham's Nathan Redmond . He also played for Palace in the Capital One Cup against Manchester United . 'Jose Mourinho has shown that for a long time in the way he is doing that.' Judging by that, QPR look to be in for a tough season given they have conceded 11 goals already, with eight of those coming in their two away games. Saints will be looking for a similarly big win on Saturday, with the pressure likely to come on the west Londoners' defence as the hosts go for a sixth successive win in all competitions. Steven Caulker is a key figure for QPR at the back and a player Koeman rejected suggestions he had moved to bring in during the summer from Cardiff. The Dutchman also denied having an interest in compatriot Leroy Fer, who he spent a brief spell coaching at Feyenoord before the midfielder moved onto Twente, Norwich and, now, the Rs. 'We have enough midfield players,' Koeman said. 'That's not the position where we have to look for new players. 'He's a great player. I have him as the coach and I know his qualities. He's still a young player, but with a lot of potential and that's true.'

"Scotland risks unprecedented austerity and the pound could ‘plunge into the abyss’ if the referendum results in a Yes vote, economic experts have warned. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research expressed dismay at Alex Salmond’s ‘Plan B’ if an independent Scotland is barred from using the pound. The think-tank said the SNP leader’s back-up plan – adopting the pound informally and reneging on Scotland’s share of Britain’s borrowings – was ‘opportunistic’ and would saddle every taxpayer in the rest of the UK with an extra £5,900 of debt. Scroll down for video . Chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander said a 'Yes' vote on Thursday would see Scotland's bonds downgraded to 'junk' status in the event of the country walking away from its share of the national debt . It warned that defaulting on its debts would make Scotland an economic pariah, because it would be seen as too untrustworthy to borrow on the international money markets. This would lead to an ‘unprecedented degree of austerity and the eventual collapse in the currency regime’, it predicted. Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said this scenario would see Scottish bonds – loans from international investors – downgraded to ‘junk’ status. This happens when it makes no sense for investors to lend money to a country because the risk of not getting it back is too high. ‘Junk status for Scottish bonds would condemn us all to higher interest rates and higher taxes to pay the inflated interest payments,’ Mr Alexander said. ‘That would consume vast amounts of money that could be spent on the NHS.’ He added: ‘The truth is that the entire economic case for separation is junk. Businesses, think-tanks, and international organisations all confirm the same thing – separation is risky, costly and bad for Scotland.’ Mr Alexander warned this would lead to higher interest rates resulting in higher taxes for everyone . The warning was issued as one of the City’s most respected economists said an independence vote would see sterling ‘plunge into the abyss’. Albert Edwards, of the French banking giant Societe Generale, said that if Scotland broke away, the chance of the rest of Britain leaving the EU would increase and this would cause international investors to pull their money out of the UK. ‘Capital will not be moving from north of the Scottish border to the south. It will be moving out of the UK altogether,’ Mr Edwards said.","Alex Salmond said Scotland will be entitled to use the pound if independent .

Curle's assistant at Notts County, former Sunderland and Rangers striker Colin West, has joined him at Brunton Park. Keither Curle has been appointed as the new Carlisle manager to replace sacked Graham Kavanagh . A club statement read: 'Carlisle United Football Club have today appointed Keith Curle as first team manager until the end of the 2015/16 season.

"When new mother Melissa Lawson noticed bruises on her legs and constant back ache, she put the symptoms down to her recent pregnancy. The 19-year-old had no reason to suspect it was a sign of something more sinister. But after visiting her doctor, the mother-of-one was immediately referred to hospital where tests revealed she was actually suffering chronic myeloid leukaemia. Melissa Lawson, 19, blamed her bruised legs and back pain last April on her recent pregnancy - shortly after giving birth to her son Michael, now 16 months, pictured . Ms Lawson, a full-time mother, said: 'In April last year I was getting stomach pains and coming out in bruises, but couldn't explain what was causing it.' Eventually, she put the bruises on her leg down to her new son Michael gently pinching her skin. She added: 'I had back ache quite early on, but my mum said she had back ache for about a year after having my brother, so that's what I put it down to. 'But one day I felt so sick, had a headache and my stomach was really swollen. I had big, lumpy bruises too. Mum said ""something is not right"".' After doctors diagnosed Miss Lawson's cancer, they kept her in at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital for two nights, while deciding the best course of medication. She said: 'I didn't know anything about leukaemia so I wasn't look for the signs because I didn't know what they were. 'Even when I was getting bruises I had put it down to the baby. I think a lot of people won't be sure what it is so I want to raise awareness so other people know what to look out for. 'It was hard on my partner, Mike. He is a car valet and had to take unpaid time off work to look after our baby. That was quite a hard time. The mother-of-one visited her doctor, who immediately referred her to hospital where tests revealed Miss Lawson was in fact suffering chronic myeloid leukaemia . Miss Lawson, who says she will one day have a brother or sister for baby Michael, is raising awareness of the disease, having not been aware of the symptoms before she was struck by the blood cancer . Leukaemia is a cancer of the blood forming system in the body. It originates in the bone marrow - the soft inner part of your bones. In leukaemia, abnormal white blood cells are made in the bone marrow. White blood cells usually circulate around the body in the blood stream and protect the body from infection. But in leukaemia the cells do not work and do not fight infections. Around one in four people with chronic myeloid leukaemia will have no symptoms when they are diagnosed. But other patients will suffer: . 'When Mike had to go back into work my mum and dad were able to step in and help out. My family have all been brilliant.' When she is ready, Miss Lawson said she hopes to have another child. Michael is now 16 months old. She said: 'Professor Clark at the Royal said it's not impossible for me to have children again. 'This may be feasible once the leukaemia has been successfully treated for another year or two. 'I'm grateful I've got Michael and he's healthy but it would be nice to have a brother or sister for him.' Prof essor Clark, a consultant haematologist, said: 'Symptoms of leukaemias are often vague 'everyday' complaints such as tiredness, aches and pains or maybe recurrent infections, that don't go away with simple measures. 'There may even be no symptoms, as they are sometimes diagnosed on a blood test in an unrelated routine check-up. 'It is always worth seeking medical advice if you have easy bruising, as with Melissa. 'A simple blood test via the GP is all that is needed to rule out a leukaemia or similar blood disorder.'","Melissa Lawson noticed bruises on her legs last April .

Other . banned articles of clothing include low cut blouses, halter and midriff . tops, low riders, muscle tees, short shorts, short skirts, wallet . chains, metal spike bracelets and metal spike necklaces, WABC reports. Also out are headbands, hats, bandanas, hoodies, sunglasses, do-rags, earlplugs, headphones, and visible undergarments. Many female students have accused the school administration of sexism, . claiming that most of the rules apply almost exclusively to female attire. In response to the dress code, teens took to Twitter to air their grievances against their school and rally their peers to protest against the draconian measures by dressing deliberately provocatively. ‘These students are rebelling to the point of basically wearing undergarments,’ one father told the New York Post. The . students' sartorial acts of defiance resulted in some 200 teens, 90 per . cent of them female, being sent to detention last week. According . to students and parents, school officials have been pulling kids from . hallways for wearing clothes deemed inappropriate and handing girls grey . Tottenville T-shirts and gym shorts to cover up until a parent could . bring them something more wholesome to change into. Crying foul: Many female students have accused the school administration of sexism, claiming that many of the rules apply almost exclusively to female attire . Call to arms: Students reacted to the restrictions by organizing protests and dressing provocatively on purpose . The Tottenville student body also has been very active on Twitter this past two weeks, firing off messages condemning their school for ostensibly restricting their freedom of expression. ‘I didn’t go to public school to be told how ‘I’m allowed’ to express myself … I can respect myself 150% and still wear shorts and a tank top,’ a girl named Katelyn wrote on Twitter. ‘Maybe instead of worrying about what I’m wearing, you should worry about the fact that I’m going to graduate high school with next to no life skills whatsoever.’ Another rebellious teen wrote: 'when the principal pays for my clothes then he can tell me what to wear...' While some parents have voiced their disapproval for the dress code, others have come to the principal's defense. One mother told CBS New York that some girls at the school have been wearing clothes more fit for strippers than for high schoolers. Department . of Education spokeswoman Marge Feinberg said it is the first year the dress code was . implemented. District . 31 Superintendent Aimee Horowitz told the New York Post that skimpy . clothing is banned because it 'interferes with the learning and teaching . process.' A strict new dress code adopted by a Staten Island school to ban skimpy clothing has resulted in several detentions in the last two weeks . Students Alexandra Gliaos and John Caccese say the dress code goes too far in some cases . Principal Joseph Scarmato, whose daughter also attends Tottenville, met with parents before the start of the school year and had them sign off on a handbook outlining the dress code and the disciplinary measures for violating the rules, Syracuse.com reported. Under the new guidelines, first-time rule-breakers will earn a trip to the dean's office along with a hour-hour detention. Scarmato explained that the policy is necessary to prepare students for college and the workforce. But students think the policy goes too far. 'They're cracking down a little too much for a school that was used to doing whatever they want,' senior Alexandra Gliaos told reporters. 'Kids were getting yelled at and they were telling them they had to put shirts on from the gym,' she added. Some students are still wearing the outlawed clothing to school in protest. 'The cheerleader outfit, it breaks the dress code,' student Jonathan Giardino told WABC. 'It's too short and goes past the relaxed line. 'If their parents let them out wearing it, there's no reason the school should be telling them not to wear it. If they care that much then get us uniforms.'","Some 200 students, most of them girls, received detention under Tottenvile High School's 'Dress for Success' policy .

"Florida homeowners may be used to spying cats wandering through their yards - but nothing prepared one resident for a feline so big he thought it was a panther. The man, who did not want to be identified, said he was stunned when he saw the oversized cat taking a walk through his back garden in West Miramar as he sat down for breakfast. He grabbed his camera and shared footage with NBC6 showing the beast roaming the lawn - and the nonchalant animal was clearly not too worried about being seen. After the footage was viewed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, officials confirmed it was not a panther but a bobcat - albeit a very large one. Scroll down for video . Mysterious: A South Florida resident captured this cat on film as it wandered through his garden. The size of the animal led him to believe it was a rare Florida Panther - but officials say it was a bobcat . Taking a stroll: The animal appeared to be in no rush as it wandered through the back yard . The homeowner recounted his shock at seeing the cat walking on his lawn. 'I told my wife, ""Look at this big dog"",' the homeowner said. 'Then the dog crossed over and got into the yard and she told me, ""That's not a dog, that's a cat."" And I realized it's a cat, but it's a big cat.' He said he was scared at first but also said he though it was 'cool'. Even though it was not a panther, the man said he still has concerns about the cat. 'I just want the whole neighborhood to be safe,' he said. 'And if it's hungry or if it's cornered, it could become a danger to everybody. 'All I want is for it to be caught and driven away. I don't want it to be hurt and I don't want it to hurt anyone either.' Similarities: The coloring of the cat resembles the Florida Panther (file image), but there are only 100 left . Spotted: The cat was actually a bobcat (file picture) although it appeared to be much larger . While it would not have been impossible for him to see a panther, it would be rare. The National Wildlife Federations reports that there are fewer than 100 Florida panthers in the wild. The endangered cats live in southern Florida in swamplands like the Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve. Still, the bobcat appeared extremely large, much bigger than the average length of 32 inches. By comparison, a Florida panther is 78 inches. Unlike the number of panthers, the bobcat population is stable. There are thought to be more than two million across the U.S., according to the International Society for Endangered Cats. They can be found in deep forest, swamps and suburban neighborhoods. See below for video .","Homeowner was shocked when he saw the cat in his yard in Miramar .

"This is the bizarre moment a bull interrupted a swimming competition - by jumping in the pool to swim alongside contestants. Swimmers at a state level competition in Madhya Pradesh, India, watched in shock as the giant bull jumped in to the pool just seconds before they were due to start the competition. The animal is understood to have entered the building via an open side door, and enjoyed his dip in the pool for over an hour - with indifferent competitors simply continuing to swim around him.

"A woman was left with huge white patches all over her body after developing skin condition vitiligo as a child. Lisa Johnson, 24, who is from Los Angeles, was targeted by bullies who made her life a misery. But a new treatment and a state of the art makeover could be about to change that. Scroll down for video . Lisa Johnson developed vitiligo when she was a child and bullies have made her life a misery ever since . Lisa suffered horrendous bullying for over 17 years before seeking professional help with the condition . Lisa, here after her face treated with the specialist coverup, says it has boosted her confidence and allowed her to be herself again . Lisa, right, with her sister Jessica after her transformative makeover which covers her vitiligo . She said: 'It's a condition which causes my skin to turn a different colour. 'I now have white patches covering more than a third of my body.' The condition is not life-threatening but its psychological effects can be devastating to sufferers. 'When I was in high school the kids were very mean to me,' added the 24-year-old. 'The abuse, the name-calling and the fighting were all very difficult to deal with. 'I would just go home and cry - I would always run home straight to my sister, she has always had my back and fought my battles for me. 'I'm just so glad I had somebody there who would stick up for me and help me through the difficult times. Lisa pictured with skin specialist Dr Pearl Grimes who hopes to give her Narrowband UV light therapy . Lisa, seen prior to a light therapy treatment, says she often receives stares and jibes in public . 'The years of bullying have led me to always expect the worst when I'm out in public. It's really difficult.' When she is walking around her home city of Los Angeles in America, Lisa often attracts stares from passersby. Her friend Robert Allen said: 'The stares are difficult to deal with. Until the light therapy has had a chance to take effect, Lisa is having make-up applied to cover her white patches . The make-up is perfectly shaded to Lisa's skin using a specialist computer program . The computer analysis means that the make up is an exact match to Lisa's skin, creating the illusion of normal skin and totally transforming Lisa's day-to-day life . Lisa seen with dermatologist Lindakay Rendina after make up has been used to cover her vitiligo . 'Instead of just saying: 'Hello, how are you?' people just stare at her. 'Amazingly she does not let it get to her or if she does, she does not show it.' Vitiligo is a long-term condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on the skin due to lack of a chemical called melanin. Melanin is produced by specialised skin cells called melanocytes, gives your skin its colour and protects it from the sun. It is not exactly clear what causes this lack of melanin, but it has been linked to problems with the immune system (autoimmune conditions) and nerve endings in the skin. Certain things can increase your chances of developing vitiligo, such as a family history of the condition or having another autoimmune problem, like hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland). Vitiligo can affect any area of your skin, but most commonly occurs on skin exposed to the sun, such as your face, neck and hands. The condition varies from person to person. Some people only get a few small, white patches that progress no further. Other people get bigger white patches that join up across large areas of their skin. There is no way of predicting how much of your skin will be affected. The white patches are usually permanent. Source: NHS.co.uk . Lisa had a normal, happy childhood until she noticed a white mark on her body - but she had no idea what was to come or how fast it would spread. She added: 'I noticed it when I was around seven years old, then it developed on to my leg and it just kept spreading.' After 17 years of suffering she has turned to a skin specialist to for help. Dr Pearl Grimes said: 'This condition dramatically affects quality of life. 'It can interfere with a person's physical and mental well-being with devastating effects. 'But there is hope available for Lisa, I'm recommending a course of Narrowband UV light therapy which should re-colour her skin.' The therapy could take some time to take effect, so in the short term Lisa has been given a specialist cover-up product. A computer generates a special formula after analysing images of Lisa's skin and it tells a dermatologist how much of each colour to use to cover over the white patches. After the procedure, Lisa said: 'It just feels absolutely fantastic - to see the smile on my sister's face when she saw me really warms my heart and my soul. 'I feel like I can be me again.' Lisa's story appears in a new series of Body Bizarre, which airs every Thursday at 9pm on TLC . Throughout his career Michael Jackson's skin tone became increasingly lighter (l-r) 1975, 1983 and 2007 . Pop legend Michael Jackson is undoubtedly one of the most famous sufferers of the skin condition ever. The Thriller singer announced that the cause of his dramatically lightening skin was vitiligo in a 1993 interview on Oprah Winfrey's self titled chat show. At the time there were various rumours being put forward as to the reason behind the singer seemingly changing ethnicity. African American Jackson had already had surgery to slim down his nose when his skin tone began to become drastically whiter from around the mid 1980s- leading some to speculate the singer was using skin bleaching as part of a effort to 'Westernise' his appearance. However, upon Jackson's death from cardiac arrest on June 25 2009, the autopsy revealed that Jackson, who was 50 at the time of his death, was indeed suffering with vitiligo. Dr Rogers confirmed from his autopsy that Jackson's skin became lighter in the 1980s owing to 'vitiligo, a skin pigmentation disease.' He added: 'So some areas of the skin appear light and others appear dark.'","Lisa  developed skin condition vitiligo when she just seven years old .

"A Florida woman charged with killing her 5-year-old son more than 20 years ago in New Jersey has pleaded not guilty. A lawyer for Michelle Lodzinski entered the plea during a brief court hearing in New Brunswick on Tuesday. Gerald Krovatin of Newark told the court his client adamantly maintains her innocence. 'We still do not believe they (the prosecutors) have a good explanation for why the case was brought 23 years later,' Krovatin told The Star-Ledger after the hearing. 'Criminal cases don't get better with age. She denies the charge and will hold the state to its proof.' Michelle Lodzinski, 46, appeared in New Brunswick, New Jersey court on Tuesday to face murder charges in the 1991 death of her 5-year-old son Timothy Wiltsey. She entered a not guilty plea . Lodzinski, 46, has been in custody since her arrest August 7. She was extradited to New Jersey on Friday and is being held in the Middlesex County jail on $2million bail. She has said her son, Timothy Wiltsey, went missing at a Sayreville carnival May 25, 1991, after going on a few rides. The mother then went to get her son a soda, and when she turned away momentarily to pay for the beverage he disappeared. Investigators said her version of events kept changing, and they never believed her story but they didn't have enough evidence to arrest her. A massive search of the fairgrounds was conducted, and investigators soon realized that no one at the carnival had even seen Timothy that night. His skull and other bones were found in a marshy area of Edison 11 months later. Timothy Wiltsey (right) went missing in May 1991, after his mother claimed she lost him at a carnival. His remains were found 11 months later in an Edison, New Jersey marsh. Lodzinski was indicted in August by a grand jury and arrested in Florida, where she was living . Lodzinski went into seclusion after her son's remains were discovered, and neighbors said at the time that she didn't appear distraught. In late July, a county grand jury handed up a one-count indictment stating she 'did purposely or knowingly kill' Timothy or did 'purposely or knowingly inflict serious bodily injury' resulting in his death. During Tuesday's hearing, Middlesex County prosecutors described some new evidence that led to Lodzinski's indictment. They said that in 2011, investigators realized some of the items found with Wiltsey's remains in 1992 had not been shown to people who could identify them. They said a blanket found with the boy's remains was shown to Lodzinski and her mother, but both women said they did not recognize it. Above, archive footage from the day Timothy's remains were found in an Edison, New Jersey marsh . Investigators tracked down one of Lodzinski's relatives who babysat for the boy and showed her the blanket. The woman told them it belonged to the boy. During a further review over the past year, another item found in 1992 was shown to another relative who recognized it as belonging to Timothy. Prosecutors did not identify the item in court or the relatives who were shown the items. Lodzinski has run into other legal troubles over the years since her son died. She surfaced in Michigan in January 1994 and said two men claiming to be FBI agents had abducted her at gunpoint outside her apartment building, forced her into a black sport utility vehicle and drove her to Detroit, where they let her out. She pleaded guilty in 1995 to making false statements to the FBI and fraudulently using the agency's seal. She was sentenced to probation. In 1997, Lodzinski was charged with stealing a computer from her former employer. She pleaded guilty to a theft charge in 1998. A federal judge sentenced her to house arrest after she admitted she committed a crime while on probation. Lodzinski pictured above in court on Tuesday with her attorney Gerald Krovatin . 'We still do not believe they (the prosecutors) have a good explanation for why the case was brought 23 years later,' Krovatin said after the Tuesday hearing.

"Three paediatric consultants were criticised by a judge yesterday for suggesting that a baby had been repeatedly shaken by its parents – without giving evidence to back their theory up. In a case in which a couple faced seeing their three infant daughters being taken into care, the experts said the baby could have been injured after being shaken several times. But Judge Heather Swindells said: ‘There was not an iota of evidence to support such a possibility.’ Judge Heather Swindells ordered that the children should stay with their mother and father, who she described as ‘loving, caring parents’ (file picture) The judge ordered that the children should stay with their 30-year-old mother and 23-year-old father, whom she described as ‘loving, caring parents’, and she cleared them of having harmed their daughters. Lincolnshire social workers had applied for the girls – one aged two and twins almost a year old – to be taken into care after doctors claimed one of the twins had received a head injury after being shaken. The girl became limp and floppy while in her father’s arms last November. The family dialled 999, and the child was found in hospital to have fluid on the brain. There were no other injuries. At the Family Court in Lincoln, the three consultants gave evidence to back up the theory that the baby had been shaken. Dr Stephen Chapman of Birmingham Children’s Hospital, Jayaratnam Jayamohan, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and Dr George Rylance, who has retired from the Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, cited a 2005 statistical study that found 86 per cent of similar cases were caused by the baby being shaken. But all suggested the baby may have been injured after being shaken several times. Judge Swindells said: ‘The universal evidence of health visitors was that the parents are loving, caring parents with good interaction with their children.’ She said the cause of the injury was unknown, and she ‘totally exonerated’ the children’s parents.","One-year-old was rushed to hospital after suffering head injury last year .

"A two-headed tortoise has been born in Denmark. Doctors at a reptile clinic were shocked when presented with the one-day-old animal. They took a video of the bizarre animal taking stock of its surroundings. The curious tortoise is unaware of the fuss and pokes both his heads out. First one head peeks out and then another slowly follows. Vet Beth Fledelius who works in the clinic in Denmark posted the clip of the unusual creature on video-sharing website Storyful. The condition, known as polycephaly occurs when twins fail to separate at birth. Tortoises with this condition are said to be able to survive without difficulty. Beth Fledelius, who works in the clinic in Denmark, posted the clip of the unusual creature Storyful . A variation of the condition is when an animal is born with two faces on a single head, a condition known as diprosopus . Other examples of polycephaly have occurred in various members of the animal kingdom. There is a two-faced cat – known as a Janus cat named for the figure in Roman mythology with two faces on one head – in Massachusetts. Other instances include a Hereford calf in California with two heads, a two-headed bobtail lizard in Australia and a two-headed dolphin which was found in Turkey .","Animal was presented to doctors in a reptile clinic in Denmark .

"With the Clasico debut of Luis Suarez now less than a month away the operation to get him fully fit to start against Real Madrid is well underway. Unfortunately, so too is the campaign to undermine him. A Madrid-based television channel called him ‘overweight’ and accused the Uruguayan of looking like an ‘ex-footballer’ in its lunchtime bulletin on Thursday. The Catalan press hit back on Friday morning saying: 'He scores two goals in a friendly and already they are scared of him.' Suarez’s double against an Indonesian Under-19 XI on Wednesday was the highlight of his first competitive 90 minutes since the World Cup. He now has 29 days to get ready for what could be one of the most spectacular Barcelona debuts in history – few players get to play their first games for the club against the old enemy at the Santiago Bernabeu. Luis Suarez has been labelled 'overweight' by the Madrid press as he draws near the end of his suspension. His first match back will be Barcelona's Clasico clash with Real at the Bernabeu on October 24 . Suarez scored twice for Barcelona B in a friendly with Indonesia Under 19 on Wednesday . The Catalan press hit back at their Madrid counterparts by claiming they were running scared of Suarez . Under the watchful eye of fitness coach Juanjo Brau Suarez, Suarez has been building his fitness since July but was forced to do so far from the club’s Joan Gamper training complex. Now with the ban lifted the clandestine gym and road work have been replaced by the arduous training sessions of coach Luis Enrique – himself a triathlon nut determined to make this Barca as fit as the team coached to 14 trophies in four years by Pep Guardiola. Luis Enrique said in his press conference: 'Suarez, fat? He is a naturally stocky player. He is at his ideal weight and he is ready to compete. If you want we'll give him liposuction but I don't think he needs it.' Suarez has worked tirelessly on his musculature – a process that started when he had to build strength around his injured left knee to make it to the Brazil World Cup. Now he needs to add that lightness of turn and burst of pace that only full matches can bring. Suarez was unveiled as a Barcelona player back in August but is suspended until late October . Suarez was banned after his bite on the shoulder of Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup . Following Wednesday’s friendly he will now play two more games ahead of the trip to Madrid on October 24. Uruguay play against Saudi Arabia and Oman on October 10 and 13 respectively, with Suarez expected to play the 90 minutes in both games. That will benefit him hugely before his big kick-off and the Uruguayan FA. who will earn over a million euros from the games, twice what they would have earned without the former Liverpool striker in the team. The 5-0 win over Indonesia showed what Barcelona – who later on Wednesday failed to register a single shot on target in a 0-0 draw with Malaga – are missing. And despite the ‘ex-footballer’ jibe that came his way the following day most Barcelona fans were sufficiently impressed with his workout and two goals. The car is out of the garage and the engine is running – now it's time for the fine tuning to make sure he starts on the grid against Pepe, Sergio Ramos and company in four weeks time.

"Ryan Tannehill plans to start for the Dolphins against the Oakland Raiders at Wembley, at least temporarily putting an end to questions about Miami’s quarterback situation. Head coach Joe Philbin hasn’t said Tannehill would be the starter but the third-year quarterback insisted that where he stands has been made clear to him. He has taken all of the snaps with the first team. ‘I’ve been preparing to play Oakland in London and to go out there and win,’ said Tannehill, who has completed just 56.5 percent of his passes and ranks 29th in the NFL in passer rating at 74.1. ‘I’m taking the first snap of the game and playing the game.’ Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill (17) looks to pass as he is pursued by Kansas City Chiefs outside linebacker Justin Houston (50) Philbin’s approach has created a distraction in the locker room, and Tannehill said that was an issue and was not a good feeling for him. But Tannehill said he understood Philbin’s handling of the situation, and remains confident in his abilities and the potential of Miami’s offense. ‘Obviously, it doesn’t feel good. It creates a bunch of stir and a bunch of distraction in the locker room, mostly from the outside coming in,’ Tannehill said. ‘Just guys having to deal with the distraction of it, it’s not a good feeling but he’s been clear with me and I know where I stand. I don’t know how it first came to me. I think I received some texts from basically everyone I’ve ever known offering me support, which is a good thing I guess, and then coach came to me.’ Backup quarterback Matt Moore confirmed that nothing has changed with his role and that he has not taken a snap with the first team since training camp. ‘I’ve taken zero reps. Ryan’s prepared the same way he always does and I’ve prepared the same way I always do,’ said Moore, who is the highest paid backup quarterback in the league and won six games as a starter for Miami in 2011. Tannehill hits the ground after being brought down by Kansas City Chiefs outside linebacker Houston . ‘We showed up on Tuesday and everything was the same. Obviously, I did get a couple of text messages from friends who read things and it caught me off guard but nothing was said in here.’ The quarterbacks’ lockers are near each other and they are together in the position meetings and on the practice field. Moore didn’t notice any difference in Tannehill’s demeanor this week. With the Dolphins trying to avoid going into the bye week at 1-3, Tannehill understands the importance of this game with Oakland and he feels like he has the full support of his teammates. He spoke confidently about the running game and the offensive line, while saying he wished Philbin had handled it differently. ‘Does it feel good to deal with all the distractions that have been created because of the situation? No,’ Tannehill said. ‘That’s life. You face distractions. You face adversity in life and you have to be able to handle it. ‘You have to be able to fight through it and become a better man, become a better player because of it. We’re going about our normal week. It’s all this stuff on the outside that seems like the world’s collapsing. I think the guys are confident, not only in their abilities but in mine.’ Tannehill  passes against the Kansas City Chiefs in the second quarter of their game at Sun Life Stadium .","The third-year quarterback has faced scrutiny about his future after a woeful start to the season .

"Retiring Yankees captain Derek Jeter had a hard time stepping into the batter's box in the bottom of the ninth inning. Overwhelmed by the outpouring of love from the fans over the past two weeks and all the final moments at Yankee Stadium in a 20-season career, the always cool Jeter was about to break down. 'I almost started crying driving here today,' Jeter said after New York's 6-5 win over Baltimore. 'I've done a pretty good job of controlling my emotions throughout the course of my career. ... Today I wasn't able to do it.' Derek Jeter approaches the deck for the first inning against Baltimore in his final game at the Yankee stadium . What he was able to do was give New York one more amazing moment in a career full of them, driving in the winning run in the ninth with - what else? - an opposite-field single to right field. Jeter leaped high with both arms raised after touching first base, and was embraced by his teammates. The 14-time All-Star then lingered on the field, seemingly not wanting to give up the only job he ever hoped to have - shortstop for the New York Yankees. 'Sort of an out-of-body experience,' Jeter said. Jeter's Core Four teammates - Andy Pettitte, Mariano Rivera and Jorge Posada - from five World Series championship teams joined their Hall of Fame manager Joe Torre and Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams on the field. Jeter's family also came out of the crowd at the urging of manager Joe Girardi. Jeter celebrates with his teammates after the New York Yankees secured a 6-5 win over Baltimore . And the fans chanted 'Thank you, Derek!' and 'De-rek Jeter!' as they have all the way throughout the Yankees' last eight games in the Bronx for 2014. Before he greeted his friends and family, Jeter took a stroll out to the spot between second and third base, waving to the crowd. In an image seen before nearly every one of his 1,391 games at Yankee Stadium, Jeter faced the outfield and crouched down for a moment of reflection. 'Basically, I just say thank you because this is all I ever wanted to do,' Jeter said of his ritual. But he wasn't done. The 40-year-old captain took one more walk to shortstop, this time covering his face with a towel for a moment or two as he took one last look around and acknowledged the crowd. The New York Yankees number two looked on as he was overcome with emotion during the national anthem . 'I want to take something special from Yankee Stadium, and the view from shortstop here tonight is what I want to take home from it,' Jeter said. The entire Orioles team watched the scene from the dugout. 'Our guys, everybody has a lot of respect for Derek and what his career has been about,' Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. 'We wish him well.' Jeter said afterward he will not play shortstop over the weekend in his final three games at Boston. But he will serve as the designated hitter, he said. Soon after, the grounds crew was out, shoveling a layer of dirt from Jeter's favorite spot into orange buckets for the memorabilia market. Jeter admitted after Wednesday's game the past couple of weeks were beginning to weigh on him and it showed. He appeared a bit stunned by the 100 media members awaiting him at his locker and took several deep breaths when he settled in at shortstop before the first pitch. 'To be honest with you, I don't know how I played this game,' Jeter said. 'I went up my first at-bat, I forgot my elbow guard. I was throwing balls away. I was giving signs to (Stephen) Drew at second base and there's no one on base, so I was all messed up.' Still, as if on cue, Jeter began his last game in pinstripes with a double. He also drove in a run with a grounder in the seventh. And he went out a winner. 'You can't even dream this stuff up,' Girardi said.","Derek Jeter admitted that he was close to crying in the Yankee stadium .

"This is the shocking moment a baby was allowed to crawl perilously close to the edge of a steep cliff in Norway so that her parents could snap a keepsake photograph. Dressed in a pink outfit and cap, the young child was accompanied by four adults, who were at least a few feet away from her, and would have faced certain death if she had rolled in the wrong direction. Hiker Fred Sirevag, who snapped the chilling photo on Saturday afternoon, said he couldn’t believe his eyes when he encountered the scene as he made his way up to Preikestolen (Pulpit Rock), a steep cliff that has a 1,982ft drop. Scroll down for video . Shocking: A baby crawls along the edge of a steep cliff in southern Norway while an adult snaps a keepsake photograph . Mr Sirevag’s photo has been circulated online and in the Norwegian press, leaving people shocked and outraged that the baby was put in a dangerous situation at the tourist attraction. He and his 11-year-old daughter were sitting down in a safe spot nearby when the family placed the baby, unaware of the danger that she faced, on the mountain ledge. He told MailOnline Travel: ‘I saw the mother and she was putting the baby down close to the edge and backing up a little bit so the other lady could get a clean photo of the baby and the Pulpit Rock in the background. ‘It’s a straight drop. You don’t want to go too close because it’s pretty scary. You’d be pretty much dead if you fall down there.’ Mr Sirevag snapped the photo and considered walking down to say something to the group, but they scooped up the baby and moved on. He added: ‘I was very shocked. It was over so quickly, I could hardly react.' Hiker Fred Sirevag, who snapped the photograph of the family, said he was stunned when the baby was placed so close to the mountain ledge . Mr Sirevag added: ‘I think they put the baby into a great risk. A baby can easily tip around and it’s really unpredictable and you never know when that will happen. ‘If the baby fell away from the mommy I don’t know if she could have caught the baby. ‘I thought this was such a crazy thing to do that people should know about this. It should never happen.’ Preben Falck, CEO of the Stavanger Tourist Association, encouraged people to use extreme caution when they hike up to Pulpit Rock. He told the Norwegian News Agency: ‘I have taken my children to Preikestolen and kept them at a safe distance away from the edge. 'All parents are different, but I wouldn't look after my children like that.’ Tourist draw: Tens of thousands of people visit Preikestolen, known as Pulpit Rock, in Forsand, Norway every year . Pulpit Rock towers over a fjord in the municipality of Forsand and is one of Norway’s most popular attractions, drawing tens of thousands of holidaymakers every year. Last year, a Spanish man plunged to his death while taking photos, reigniting the debate over whether a security fence should be installed to protect visitors. But Falck believes a fence or signs would spoil the experience: ‘We cannot put up signs telling that parents should not put their children down near the edge. Nor do I think we should put up fences and secure the area.’","A father photographed the shocking scene while he made his way up Pulpit Rock in southern Norway .

"Lava has reached empty lots of a Hawaii subdivision on Big Island Monday as officials eye evacuation routes for residents to escape the wrath of a nearby volcano. Residents of the Kaohe Homesteads have been eyeing the eruptions of the Kilauea volcano, as lava flows crossed onto vacant lots of the subdivision on a slow crawl to the northeast. Hawaii County spokesman Kevin Dayton says lava from the volcano has slowed and there are no evacuations ordered. Scroll down for video . Destruction: Lava flows reached empty lots of a remote development on Big Island, threatening to cut off roads and services . Officials say the lava is now moving about 750 feet per day, according to Hawaii News Now. Meanwhile, work continues to prepare unpaved, defunct roads to be used as alternate routes if lava reaches a major highway. Officials say that could happen within weeks. Homeowners worry that if lava reaches the highway, they will be cut off from the rest of the island. 'If it goes north of us and cuts off the highway, we're afraid we're going to lose services such as electric, water, information services like telephone, internet,' property manager Russell Bellman told MailOnline last week. One of the lots closest to the lava flow is government-owned land. Two others belong to private owners. Hawaii Volcano Observatory spokeswoman Janet Babb says the speed of lava depends on the supply of magma and what's going on inside the volcano. Observatory scientists flew over the flow Monday and said lava is about three miles from the highway. Danger: Residents hope the lava flow stops or moves out of the path of homes in the Kaohe Homesteads subdivision, a remote deelopment in 'paradise' Smoke and fire: Lava from the Kilauea volcano burned through 10 miles of forest before threatening a small town . Keep out: Officials shut down the Wao Kele o Puna reserve and have worked to construct alternative evacuation routes . The lava has moved through more than 10 miles of forest after spewing out of an open vent in June. The state closed the Wao Kele o Puna Forest Reserve last week until further notice out of safety concerns for visitors. The lava has destroyed trees and vegetation as it slowly flows through the forest, and clouds of smoke can be seen from the town.

"A businessman jailed for fraud after being 'swallowed' by his addiction to online gambling has written a repentant letter to his family revealing the double life he kept from them for 30 years. David Bradford, 58, of Waterthorpe, Sheffield, was jailed for two years in April after swindling a Welsh company out of more than £50,000 to repay private bank loans and secret gambling debts. His wife Denise and three children had no idea he was in trouble until his sentencing - and the father recently decided to come clean to them, telling them about the 'money bug' that wrecked their family. Happier times: David Bradford (right) is pictured with son Adam, (left) who was unaware that his father had a gambling problem and was thousands of pounds in debt until the day before his sentencing . In a repentant letter from behind bars, the former chair of governors at a children's school, who was paid £71,000 a year in his role for a healthcare supplies company, said he was 'stung by the power of money'. He said a love of money led to a mountain of debt which sparked his pursuit of a quick 'win'. Bradford has appealed to anyone falling into a similar situation to seek help and support at the first sign of trouble. In the letter, he writes: 'This is my truth. I am a fraudster. I am a gambler, maybe a compulsive gambler. 'I discovered money talked and those dreams on the horizon could be brought closer. The 'money bug' was a disease idolised by all. 'I became a keen follower. I did not have to look far to find a bank or organisation that would lend me money and it seemed this was the way one bettered oneself. Warning: Adam Bradford, (above) who received a letter from his father from prison, has warned people about the dangers of online gambling and has started a campaign calling for tighter regulations on the industry . 'I was swallowed down this tunnel to a point where I could only borrow money to finance the repayments of earlier borrowing, a self-perpetuating and self-defeating spiral of debt. 'I never shared the state of my debt ridden life - not with my family, not even with myself. 'This part of my life has an unknown beginning buried by me in my mind under lock and key. 'Along this journey of deceit I took to gambling - firstly as a way of making a quick win to kill this mountain of debt and then, as it failed to live up to those expectations, it became an escape with potential to cure my money ailments. 'The atmosphere of my life was turning very sour and yet I still was not brave enough to openly admit the absolutely devastating money mess I was burying myself in. 'But the atmosphere can be sourer, more putrid and in my dark side this was the natural course to take - fraud!' Mr Bradford said he gambled 'like it was an Olympic sport'. 'This is my truth. I am a fraudster. I am a gambler, maybe a compulsive gambler. 'I discovered money talked and those dreams on the horizon could be brought closer. 'The 'money bug' was a disease idolised by all.

'Along this journey of deceit I took to gambling - firstly as a way of making a quick win to kill this mountain of debt and then, as it failed to live up to those expectations, it became an escape with potential to cure my money ailments.' Now, the Bradford family face losing their home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, and say their lives have been left in turmoil by the revelations. He added: 'Now my family do not trust me and all my good points count for nothing. My friends have retreated and are ashamed even to call me an acquaintance. 'My colleagues, my MP and most who know me have put a big distance between me and them. I would do the same if I was them. 'My sentence extends to a family distraught, a family set to lose everything now. My friends' views of me are tainted and I am damaged forever. 'If anyone sees a little piece of themselves in my story may I offer them this advice - never lie. Seek help and support at the first sign of trouble.' His son Adam, 21, claimed after the sentencing that he 'was in absolute disbelief and disgust' at his father's actions. The young businessman has now launched a campaign calling for tighter regulations and control of the online gambling industry to protect those suffering from compulsive behaviours. He said: 'We will lose everything we've got. Our house is on the line, our life is in turmoil and my father is similarly suffering from psychological problems. 'Life will never be the same for us and my dad's letter shows for the first time how dangerous compulsive behaviour can be, made ever worse by the availability of money and gambling in the modern world. 'I hope my father's story and honesty helps others to know this situation is not as rare as it sounds, help and support is available. Do not be afraid to reach out and access it.' Apologetic: The fraudster sent four pages of scrawling writing to his family, in which he came clean about the double life that he had kept from them for 30 years .

Her daily fitness regime includes two sessions of one hour running intervals, teaching two classes of yoga and pilates and four high intensity interval training sessions each week. 'Most of these are with no equipment and can be done at home,' she said. 'I was training a lot more before children as I was racing triathlons and teaching a lot more fitness classes.

"Yohan Cabaye has advised Newcastle fans to lay off Alan Pardew and insists that the players are to blame for the club's early-season crisis. Recent Newcastle matches have turned toxic with supporters at home and away calling for Pardew to be sacked while aiming a constant torrent of abuse at him from the stands. Owner Mike Ashley has stood firm and so far not bowed to fan pressure by getting rid of Pardew, even though they are second-from-bottom and winless in the league this season. Yohan Cabaye (right) believes Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew (left) is the right man for the job . Yohan Cabaye has come out in support of his former boss at Newcastle United, under-fire Alan Pardew . Alan Pardew has endured a torrid time of late but Cabaye insists he is 'a good manager' who deserves time . French midfielder Cabaye moved to Paris Saint-Germain from Newcastle last January in a £20million deal . Cabaye, who played for Newcastle under Pardew for two-and-a-half years, said: 'The manager is in trouble, but he shouldn't get all the complaints because it's not only him. 'Even when I was there, the second season for me wasn't good and it was up to the players on the pitch. The manager gave us the way to play, but after that it's up to the players. 'We got the complaints two years ago because the players knew the job wasn't good from us. Now I hope it's the same. The players have to work harder to get the club higher in the league.' Newcastle supporters held numerous banners calling for Pardew to be sacked during the 1-0 defeat at Stoke . Cabaye was a firm fans' favourite on Tyneside and Pardew's side relied on his goals and invention . In the French midfielder's second season at Newcastle the club had a strong run in the Europa League but struggled in the league and were close to being relegated. They finished that 2012-13 season in 16th, just two places and five points above the drop zone. Back then, they were able to call on Cabaye in the heart of their midfield with his creativity on the ball and ability to score sensational strikes. But now there is no obvious player who has replaced him since he left in January, making a £19million switch to Paris Saint-Germain and goals have dried up since he left. Cabaye refused to play against Manchester City in August 2013 as he tried to orchestrate a move to Arsenal . Despite Pardew's criticism of Cabaye, the Frenchman insists Pardew's man-management skills are brilliant . The Frenchman maintains that the only reason he wanted to move was because he felt PSG were a bigger club who could offer him Champions League football and not due to any issues with Newcastle. He said: 'I like Pardew because he gave me confidence to play the way I did while I was there. Magpies owner Mike Ashley reportedly told a journalist Pardew would be sacked if Newcastle lost at Stoke . 'He is really close to the players and he talks a lot with them. He puts them in a good frame of mind to play well.' Ashley has also come under fire from angry supporters who are unhappy with the way he runs their club, but Cabaye added: 'I cannot complain about the owner. He was fantastic with me and with my family. 'The fans have their reasons and I respect them, but I respect the owner as well.'

"Half of drivers ignore speed limits on Britain’s motorways and town centre roads, shocking new figures show. Last year 47 per cent of cars travelled faster than the 70mph limit on motorways, but the government has ruled out doing anything about it. Motoring groups said the ‘default limit’ was now 80mph, because drivers know they will avoid prosecution. Scroll down for video . Most drivers think they will not be fined if they break the 70mph limit on motorways, driving groups claimed . Official data from the Department for Transport reveals the scale of law breaking on the nation’s roads. In 2013, 47 per cent of cars, 46 per cent of motorbikes and 48 per cent of vans broke the 70mph limit in free-flowing traffic. It also shows that in built up areas where the limit is 30mph, drivers are just as willing to speed. There are fears that the reluctance of police forces to stop people speeding on motorways could be encouraging drivers to think they will escape a ticket in residential roads, where speeding is more dangerous. The government has announced plans to increase the speed limit for HGVs on single carriageway roads from 40mph to 50mph. It follows data showing that 73 per cent of lorries breaks the current limit. Transport minister Baroness Kramer said: ‘There are a variety of reasons why it is appropriate to change the national HGV speed limits on single and dual carriageways. ‘One is that the low level of compliance with them is symptomatic of their being set at the wrong level compared to other limits. ‘So on single carriageways the non-compliance level for cars is 7 per cent and buses and coaches 26 per cent, compared to 73 per cent for articulated lorries.’ However, the government insists it is not reviewing national speed limits for other types of vehicles. The last Transport Secretary Philip Hammond announced plans to raise the motorway limit to 80mph. But the proposals have been shelved by his replacement, Patrick McLoughlin, with officials saying it is not a priority. Almost half of cars, motorbikes and vans break the 70mph speed limit on motorways in free flow traffic . There are fears that the 'flexibility' in motorway limits encourages people to break the law in built up areas where the speed limit is 30mph . Edmund King, President of the AA, said: ‘In decent weather in a modern car at a good distance from the care in front, 80mph is probably a safe speed. ‘But 50mph in an old car, on a pot-holed motorway, too close to the car in front is probably too fast.’ He said the ‘default speed limit’ on motorways is now 80mph. ‘One is rarely if ever stopped by the police and prosecuted between 80 and 80mph. AA President Edmund King warned drivers now think they can get away with speeding . ‘Therefore it is almost accepted as the common law speed limit. That’s why half of drivers tend to break it.’ But Mr King warned the flouting of the law on motorways risked creating a precedent in built-up areas, where ignoring the 30mph limit could become the norm. ‘If drivers are of the opinion that there is some flexibility around speed limits the danger is that when it comes to lower speed limits, which are much more crucial in road safety, we don’t want drivers to have that same flexibility. ‘Driving at 40mph in a 30mph area is incredibly dangerous.’ He called for variable limits for different times of the day. ‘In the UK we don’t trend to treat our drivers as intelligent. ‘There is probably a good case in some of our urban areas for a different limit during the day time when more people are around and in the middle of the night when no-one is around.’ Labour’s shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: ‘Road safety and law enforcement should be a top priority for any Government. Sadly, more than 10,000 frontline traffic police posts have gone since 2010. ‘Instead of increasing HGV speed limits, ministers need to take concrete steps to make our roads safe for all users, particularly children, older people and cyclists.’ A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Most drivers know that keeping to the speed limit can mean the difference between life and death in a collision, regardless of the road type. ‘We want people to drive safely at all times, which is we recently increased the fixed penalty to £100 for several driving offences, including careless driving, and why we have given local councils more flexibility to implement 20mph limits and zones.’","47% of cars, 46% of motorbikes and 48% of vans break 70mph limits .

"Cesc Fabregas and the rest of the Spain squad arrived in Madrid ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg. The Chelsea midfielder flew in fresh from his new club's win over Arsenal at Stamford Bridge. Sergio Ramos claimed he was optimistic he'll be able to play a part in this week's Euro 2016 qualifiers away to Slovakia and Luxembourg despite being forced off in Real Madrid's La Liga match on Sunday. Cesc Fabregas and Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos defender arrive for training with the national squad . Ramos had to be replaced at halftime during Real's 5-0 win at home to Athletic Bilbao and Real coach Carlo Ancelotti said the player had felt discomfort in a calf muscle. 'I am optimistic about the medical tests,' Ramos told reporters as he arrived at Spain's training base outside Madrid on Monday. 'I want to be involved in everything with the national team.' Ramos would be first choice in central defence if fit as Spain look to follow up their 5-1 success at home to Macedonia in their opening Group C match. If they qualify as expected from a pool that also includes Ukraine and Belarus, the 2010 world champions will be chasing a third consecutive continental title in France in two years' time. They play Slovakia in Zilina on Thursday and take on Luxembourg in Luxembourg City on Sunday. Real Madrid and Spain captain Iker Casillas turns up for training ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifiers . There are two new faces in coach Vicente del Bosque's squad: forward Rodrigo, who is on loan at Valencia from Benfica, and Bayern Munich left back Juan Bernat. Brazil-born Rodrigo, who played for Real Madrid and Spain at youth level and is a cousin of Bayern's Spain midfielder Thiago Alcantara, said he was determined to make the most of the experience. 'We all know how difficult it is to get here,' the 23-year-old told reporters. 'Spain is one of the best teams in the world, if not the best, and it takes a lot to make it into the squad. 'I am here to enjoy the football and the experience and give the best of myself.' Rodrigo is behind Chelsea striker Diego Costa and Valencia team mate Paco Alcacer in the pecking order up front and is unlikely to start either of this week's matches.

"House prices soared by 11.7 per cent over the past year to hit a new record high of £272,000, official figures revealed this morning. In the 12 months to July the cost of buying a home jumped in every region – but prices in London continued to pull away from the rest of the country. Property in the capital boomed by 19.1 per cent and by 12.1 per cent in the wider South East. With house prices running far ahead of inflation  and pay it is becoming increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to get on the ladder. In July, prices paid by first-time buyers were 13.5 per cent higher on average than in July 2013. The average price paid for a first home in July  was £209,000. Scroll down for video . House prices are almost double the national average in London and are growing more than twice as fast as most areas of the country . First time buyers are finding it increasingly difficult to get their foot on the housing ladder, as prices pull away from wages . Soaring house prices are pushing more and more people into paying stamp duty. With the average price of a home now £272,000, thousands of ordinary families are being forced to pay 3 per cent in tax - or £8,100. Stamp duty starts at 1 per cent for homes over £125,000, before jumping to 3 per cent on properties worth more than £250,000. Families in London can now expect to pay 4 per cent stamp duty because the average price of a property in the capital is now more than £500,000. The duty is levied at 5 per cent on homes worth more than £1million and 7 per cent for those worth over £2million. House prices across England - excluding London and the South East - grew by  7.9 per cent to hit an average of £206,000. This is just ahead of Wales, where prices increased by 7.4 per cent and Scotland which saw 7.6 per cent growth. House prices in Northern Ireland meanwhile increased by just 4.5 per cent. The average house price across the UK in July was £272,000. In England the average home is £284,000, £171,000 in Wales, £139,000 in Northern Ireland and £198,000 in Scotland. Prices in London were the highest in the country – at £514,000. The North East had the lowest average house price at £156,000. Several UK regions saw property prices reach fresh all-time highs in the month of July, with the East Midlands, the West Midlands and the South West now joining London, the East and the South East in having price levels higher than their pre-financial crisis peaks of 2007/08, the Office for National Statistics said. Average house prices in Scotland have now passed their pre-financial crisis peak of June 2008 and, alongside England, property values there are now at record levels, the ONS said. House prices in England are now 13 per cent above their previous high, while those in Scotland have climbed to 0.7 per cent above previous peak levels. Wales is not far behind Scotland, with prices there just 0.8 per cent below their 2008 peak. Northern Ireland remains the area with the furthest climb to recover to previous peak levels, with prices there 46.7 per cent below their peak. People are increasingly turning to mortgages lasting more than 30 years as house prices continue to soar . Figures released by the Council of Mortgage Lenders last week showed that the number of mortgages handed out to first-time buyers passed 30,000 in July, marking the first time this has happened during a one-month period since August 2007. But first-time buyers are typically having to borrow record amounts to get on the property ladder, with the average size of a new loan taken out by this sector standing at £127,500 in July, according to the CML’s figures. The current low interest rate environment is helping to keep borrowing costs down, but home owners have been warned to start thinking now about how they will cope with the prospect of higher payments when the Bank of England base rate eventually starts to move off its historic 0.5 per cent low.","London prices soared by 19.1% in the 12 months to July, figures reveal .

"Sarah McClay, a zookeeper, who was mauled to death at South Lakes Animal Park by a Sumatran tiger . The colleague of a zookeeper who was mauled to death by a tiger has told her inquest the big cat that attacked her was on a 'starve day' to recreate conditions in the wild. Sarah McClay, 24, was attacked in the big cat enclosure at South Lakes Wild Animal Park in Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria, on May 24 last year. She was going about her routine duties at the park when she was mauled by a male Sumatran tiger called Padang. She was taken by air ambulance to Royal Preston Hospital but later died from her injuries. At day two of an inquest into her death at South Cumbria Coroner's Court, colleague Emma Els told of how the two Sumatran tigers at the park were on a starve day, a tactic employed once a week to mimic the conditions of the wild. The inquest also heard how there had been a leg of meat in the keepers' corridor of the tiger house and the cats with their incredible sense of smell, would have sensed it. The hearing heard how Mrs Els had been in the tiger house to carry out some greasing of doors and had spoken with Miss McClay, who was the cat keeper on the day of the incident. Mrs Els, had run out of grease when she came to work on the doors in the Sumatran tiger side of the building. She said she left the tiger house and went to a digger working on the site, where a member of staff changed the cartridge, before she headed back. Speaking through her tears, Mrs Els, who was an animal carer at the zoo with around six years' experience, told the inquest: 'There were people outside. Somebody had shouted ""the tiger is out"", but people were always making jokes saying ""there's a cat behind the window"" and making jokes like that, so it took me a second to realise. 'But as I got closer, I could see there was something completely wrong. I started running towards the tiger house and, as I got to the viewing window, there was a Sumatran tiger. One of the tigers at the South Lakes Animal Park in Dalton-in-Furness. An inquest heard today that the tigers were on a 'starve day' on the day of the attack . The inquest also heard how there had been a leg of meat in the keepers' corridor of the tiger house and the cats with their incredible sense of smell, would have sensed it . 'I could see a Sumatran in that room and she was on her back with the tiger behind her and I remember shouting on the radio ""Padang has got Sarah, we need help"".' The inquest also heard evidence from Mrs Els' husband Cornelius, who was a maintenance man at the zoo. He heard over the radio that there had been an emergency and ran to the tiger house. He said: 'I heard my wife come on the radio. I couldn't quite hear what was the problem the first time because she was distressed. A post mortem examination found Miss McClay died from ‘multiple injuries’ which the pathologist described as ‘unsurvivable’ 'The second message said the tiger had got Sarah.' He added that staff went to get the firearms and he asked a colleague for a crow bar so they could force entry to the tiger building. Once inside, he secured door D2 - where witness Gareth Bell had seen a tiger take Miss McClay. He said door D1 was already secure, but doors G2 and G1 were open. A post mortem examination found Miss McClay died from ‘multiple injuries’ which the pathologist described as ‘unsurvivable’. The inquest continues.

"Lewis Hamilton was again happy to cast himself in the role of his hero Ayrton Senna, raising the possibility of infamy repeating itself on the typhoon-threatened Suzuka track on Sunday. It was here, unforgettably, that the rivalry of Senna and Alain Prost reached its nasty zenith with collisions in their title fights of 1989 and 1990. What chance Hamilton and his championship rival Nico Rosberg turning their silver cars against each other? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton driving at speed on a public road in Japan . Lewis Hamilton prepares to drive ahead of the second practice session at the Japanese Grand Prix . Hamilton (right) was again happy to cast himself in the role of his hero Ayrton Senna (left) His feud with teammate Nico Rosberg (left) has been compared to that of Senna and Alain Prost . Prost's Williams-Renault is closely followed by Senna's McLaren Honda in 1992 . Frenchman Prost raises both hands in despair after colliding with teammate Senna . Asked if an injustice — such as Rosberg causing him to crash at Spa six weeks ago, perhaps — would incite him to act as Senna did, Hamilton said: ‘Yeah, I think that’s human nature. I’m pretty sure everyone has been through an experience like that, and if they haven’t, good for them. ‘If someone does you wrong, you feel like going all out on them. That’s just normal. It could be from a relationship, where you’ve got a girl and some dude comes and messes with your chick, and you want to kill that dude. It’s the same kind of thing. The same kind of injustice.’ The analogy may have been a bit mid-Atlantic in its argot, a bit ill-judged in its tone. But it was hardly stranger than his remarks about the vagaries of ill-luck. ‘It’s like Mother Teresa,’ he said. ‘You can’t do anything about what she decides.’ A collision at Suzuka in 1989 between McLaren team-mates Alain Prost  and Ayrton Senna had handed the world title to Prost. The following year, at the same circuit, Senna claimed pole but was enraged when his appeal to switch to the cleaner side of the track was rejected. He vowed that if Prost — now driving for Ferrari and the only man who could beat Senna to the crown — gained the advantage into the first corner, Senna would try to take the lead regardless of the consequences. The two duly came together at the first corner, sending both off the track. The crash meant that Senna had clinched the drivers’ championship for McLaren for a second time. Given that the Blessed sister helped the poor of Calcutta rather than determined the fates of racing drivers, it can only be assumed he meant Mother Nature, whose reach purportedly extends far beyond the Indian subcontinent. Returning to Senna-Prost, Hamilton said: ‘I think Senna had a sheer belief that something was his.’ Hamilton was excusing Senna’s actions here in this bleak town in the Far East — taking Prost out on the first lap in 1990 — on the basis that the Brazilian was merely avenging the Frenchman crashing into him towards the end of the previous title decider. Senna's feud with Prost came to boiling point at Suzuka in 1989, where the Brazilian came off second best after a collision . The collision in Suzuka handed Prost the title in 1989 . Hamilton heads into the weekend three points clear of teammate and rival Rosberg . There are concerns about whether the Japanese Grand Prix will even take place due to the arrival of Typhoon Phanfone . Hamilton was aged only four and five on those occasions, but he claims to remember the two incidents. They are probably patched into his memory by the recent Senna movie that charts what are probably the two most memorable moments in motor-racing history. ‘It was a cool period of time in Formula One,’ he said. ‘I had just started watching at that time with my dad. When I watch it back nowadays, the second crash, that was cool. With the other one it’s very hard to call who was right or wrong when they were at the chicane. It wasn’t black and white. ‘I’ve always felt like I could relate or had a good connection with Ayrton. He was always my favourite driver. I have felt a lot of things in my life that I think he may have felt. I related to him more than any other driver.’ The similarities between the Senna-Prost era and Hamilton-Rosberg is helped by the German’s thoughtful manner, which makes him a latter-day ‘Professor’ Prost. Rosberg has made no promise to punt Hamilton off here, saying only: ‘It’s nice to hear comparisons like those because they are two of the greats. But personally I feel it’s a completely different battle.’ It is still a scrap for which any petrolhead would willingly set his alarm at 7.50am for an advertised start 10 minutes later in the dawn of your British Sabbath. But, be warned, you may not be tuning into the race but into a typhoon, waffling pundits or simply a package of highlights. Senna and Prost as teammates in November 1988 before the Australian Grand Prix . There is talk about a possible swap of teams between Ferrari's Fernando Alonso (right) and Red Bulls Sebastien Vettel (left) The Suzuka track, which Hamilton and Rosberg will compete on if the Grand Prix goes ahead . There is no certainty that the Japanese Grand Prix will actually take place because of Typhoon Phanfone’s expected arrival. Organisers spent Friday exchanging emails containing data from various meteorological authorities. They are delaying a decision on whether to shift the start of the race but, as of last night, said they were ‘95 per cent certain’ it would be staged as scheduled. What is really putting the wind up F1 people is that the next race is a week Sunday, 5,000 miles away in Russia. Getting the freight out on Monday, when the typhoon is most widely tipped to hit town, will be extremely hard. The scheduling is absurd. A storm was also brewing along the paddock concerning Fernando Alonso and his future at Ferrari. The growing feeling is that the Spaniard will leave at the end of the season, with his destination unknown. A swap deal with Sebastian Vettel? Go to McLaren, where he would probably force Jenson Button’s departure and be made outright No 1? Wait for any fallout at Mercedes?

"Caterham principal Manfredi Ravetto said on Friday there were no guarantees the Formula One team would make it to the end of the season but expressed confidence they could do so. Caterham chief Manfredi Ravetto is confident Caterham will survive the season . Caterham's future, a constant source of speculation in a paddock populated by teams hit hard by the high costs of competing, was thrown into doubt ahead of Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix when bailiffs raided their British factory. The seizure of various items raised questions about the team's participation at Suzuka but their two cars participated as usual in Friday practice. Speaking to reporters shortly after arriving in Japan, Ravetto recognised the uncertainty had not been dispelled entirely. 'I agree I did not provide you with a bankable guarantee that we will be here until the end of the season or next year, but who can?' he said after initially dodging the question about the team's survival. 'I can tell you that I am very much confident,' he added reiterating that the team's 2015 car was currently being developed in the Toyota wind-tunnel in Cologne, Germany. 'On the other side we are also realistic,' Ravetto added. 'We know where we are coming from, or at least where this team is coming from, so we are also quite relaxed in this respect.' The troubled team, who have never scored a point and are last in the standings, changed hands in July when Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes, frustrated by the lack of results, pulled the plug and sold it to a group of unidentified Swiss and Middle-Eastern investors. The Caterham team is still searching for their first point in Formula One ahead of the Japan Grand Prix . They are represented by former Jordan, MidlandF1, Spyker and HRT boss Colin Kolles, a specialist in keeping ailing teams afloat and who remains very much in the background. Caterham remain based at Leafield in central England but are now linked to the Caterham sportscar company in name only. Ravetto, who took over as principal last month, said the items seized by bailiffs had belonged to companies that had nothing to do with the Formula One team. QPR owner Tony Fernandes pulled out of Caterham after being frustrated by poor results . Caterham driver Kamui Kobayashi's car is carried off after crashing during practice in Suzuka . 'When they (the bailiffs) were in Leafield, not a single screwdriver was removed for the very simple reason that our solicitors got all the paperwork done in order to prove that it is a matter of totally different companies,' he said. Ravetto said parts bound for the Japanese Grand Prix had not been shipped back to Britain after the last race in Singapore. 'As far as I can see, the parts of the 2014 car for the Japanese Grand Prix are next door,' he added. 'There was a bailiff who removed certain stuff, but this is more memorabilia than race critical parts.'

"Gaming geeks can get their hands on a piece of history when 800 unearthed copies of the 'world's worst' video game go up for sale on eBay in the coming weeks. An excavation in New Mexico back in April turned up thousands of copies of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial that had been buried in a landfill in 1983. For years, the story that hundreds of thousands of copies of an Atari 2600 game buried in the desert had the air of an urban legend. Scroll down for video . Dig it: Archaeologists were joined by filmmakers and fans of the 'world's worst' game as it was unearthed earlier this year in New Mexico . That is, as CBS reports, until a team of archaeologists together with gamers and filmmakers came together at an Alamogordo landfill to dig up what might possibly be the biggest collection of the video game that's beloved for how terrible it is. The game was developed for Atari to coincide with the theatrical release of Steven Spielberg's now-classic film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. But it turned out to be a complete dud, leaving Atari with mountains of copies it kept in a warehouse in El Paso, Texas, in a stockpile of 750,000 unsold titles. James Heller told KBOI2 that, as an employee for Atari back in 1983, he was responsible for unloading the games, and dumped thousands into a landfill near Roswell, along with six truckloads of cement. But the games didn't stay buried, as an archaeological dig unearthed thousands of E.T. games in April. Fuel Entertainment and Xbox Entertainment Studios claimed a couple hundred copies for a documentary they are developing. Atari: The company was tasked with rolling out a game for Steven Spielberg's cinema classic and turned in a title that couldn't even excite audiences in 1982 . Legend: The game lives on, being played for viewers on YouTube, where the game is mocked for frustrating controls, lack of a story and being generally devoid of any interesting gameplay . Other copies are going to museums, including one in Rome. The rest will be put up for auction by the town of Alamogordo, which owns the landfill. What's still to be seen is who would want what was one of the biggest commercial flops of its time is still to be seen. 'It could be either worth 50 bucks apiece or be worth 5 bucks apiece,; an organizer, Joe Lewandowski, told CBS.","An excavation of a New Mexico landfill in April turned up thousands of copies of E.T. the Extra Terrestrial .

"Arsenal have completed their final training session ahead of their Premier League clash with Chelsea, a fixture they lost 6-0 last season. Aaron Ramsey and club captain Mikel Arteta will both miss the match through injury but Jack Wilshere trained without any issues as the Gunners prepared to get their revenge for last season's defeat. Arsene Wenger described that match at Stamford Bridge as one of the lowest points in his career while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain said it was a match he will remember for the rest of his life. Mid-week hat-trick hero Danny Welbeck and Calum Chambers in conversation in the Gunners' final training session before facing Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . World Cup winning German pair Mesut Ozil and Per Mertesacker have struggled for form after their summer exploits but are slowly getting back to their best . Alexis Sanchez, who has scored five goals since joining Arsenal, is no stranger to facing Joe Mourinho from his time playing for Barcelona in Spain . Gunners boss Arsene Wenger lost to Chelsea 6-0 in his 1000th game in charge of Arsenal, and said he wanted revenge against Mourinho's side . Speaking to Arsenal.com, Chamberlain said: 'It was a horrendous day. You would like to say it was one that you forget and don't remember, but I'm sure it's one that I'm going to remember for the rest of my life. 'It was funny because I was always saying that I'd never played at Stamford Bridge. I'd been waiting a few years to play there. It definitely didn't pan out the way I would have liked it to.' But the 21-year-old showed no signs of fear when talking about heading back to west London, and insisted Arsenal were ready to get their revenge. He said: 'They are big competition to us so we'll be looking to go there and make a statement early on in the season. I definitely believe we can.' Santi Cazorla played in a much deeper role than he is used to during the 4-1 win over Galatasaray in their Champions League group game last Wednesday .

"Dwight Yorke has insisted Christian Benteke must be given time to return to top form at Aston Villa. The ex-Villa hitman has called on the team to help ease the pressure on the striker after his injury lay-off. Benteke is in contention to make his comeback after almost six months out with a ruptured Achilles in Saturday's home clash with Manchester City. Dwight Yorke believes Christian Benteke (pictured) needs time to reach top form for Aston Villa . Benteke (right) is making his way back to full fitness after rupturing his Achilles almost six months ago . He has scored 34 goals in 67 games for Villa and played a key role in their survival in the Barclays Premier League since his £7million switch from Genk in 2012. And Yorke insisted, despite a positive start to the new season which sees Villa sit sixth, the returning 23-year-old cannot be expected to shoulder the burden on his own. 'The last two or three seasons have not been great and there was one in particular where Benteke kept them up. People in the team need to be doing a bit more for me,' he said. 'Winning football matches breeds confidence within the club. Benteke was a breath of fresh air when he first came in and everyone started playing to a certain level and I've not seen that when he's been injured. 'Villa are going through a difficult run of games but have got off to a good start and hopefully they can come through the next couple and progress.' 23-year-old scored a penalty in Villa's 3-0 under-21 win over Bolton on Monday as he steps up his recovery . Benteke scored a penalty in Villa's 3-0 under-21 win over Bolton on Monday as he neared a comeback from the injury which forced him to miss Belgium's World Cup campaign. He scored 11 goals last term before being ruled out in April and also suffered a hip problem during the season. His debut year, 2012-13, saw the striker smash 23 goals but ex-Manchester United ace Yorke believes he must be granted patience now. Belgian international has scored 34 goals in 67 games for Villa - including 23 in his debut season . 'It's been a long time and he has to take it easy but it is good news for Villa,' he said. 'He had an amazing first season and there's always one unknown candidate who comes in who people are not sure of, like (Leonardo) Ulloa at Leicester this season. 'There are always questions of whether he could do it the next year but unfortunately the injury knocked him down, he missed the World Cup and dropped behind (Romelu) Lukaku (for Belgium).'","Christian Benteke needs time to return to form for Aston Villa, believes Dwight Yorke .

"President Obama's top military general told a U.S. Senate panel on Tuesday that American troops might soon provide Iraqi forces with 'close combat advising' in the fight against the ISIS terror army. That clarification of the Pentagon's mission in the Middle East could mean that U.S. soldiers and Marines are embedded with Iraqi army units, helping them conduct warfare. Gen. Martin Dempsey, who chairs the military's joint chiefs of staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the American military is currently serving a purely advisory role. But in certain circumstances, he said, they might provide 'close combat advising.' Citing a hypothetically urgent mission focused on 'retaking Mosul' as anti-war protesters provided frequent interruptions, he said he could envision U.S. troops 'accompanying that mission.' Scroll down for video . 'I can't believe we're still protesting this s**t!': Anti-war protesters tried to preempt testimony from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Monday . Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey (right) said he might recommend inserting U.S. troops to 'accompany' Iraqis in combat situations, if airstrikes failed to neutralize ISIS . Protesters, from the far-left CODEPINK group, numbered at least 10 -- all of whom managed to get into the hearing room without a challenge from Capitol Police . Asked by New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte whether the president has ruled out the use of American ground forces in a combat role, Dempsey responded, 'Yes. But he has told me as well to come back to him on a case-by-case basis.' He said that if needed, he 'would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of ground forces.' In his opening statement, he said that 'if we reach the point where I believe our advisers should accompany Iraqi troops on attacks against specific ISIL targets, I will recommend that to the president.' ISIL is an alternate name for ISIS. President Obama has maintained that American forces won't have a combat mission in Iraq. But Oklahoma Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe said Tuesday that he's not convinced the White House is true to its word. 'It will take an army to beat an army, but instead the President presented a limited counter-terrorism strategy,' Inhofe said during the hearing. 'His claim of ""no boots on the ground"" is an insult to the men and women in Iraq today who are serving in harm’s way. We already have boots on the ground in Irbil and in Baghdad and throughout Iraq.' Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel faced multiple questions from lawmakers in the first high-stakes hearing examining Obama's expanded military campaign to counter the relentless terrorist threat from Middle East extremists. The U.S. military conducted strikes near Baghdad against ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. ISIS has seized large swaths of Iraq and Syria. Obama is seeking congressional support to train and equip vetted Syrian moderates fighting both the Islamic militants and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Dempsey said the United States is prepared to strike Islamic targets in Syria. 'This will not look like ""shock and awe"" because that is not how ISIL is organized. But it will be persistent and sustainable,' Dempsey said, referring to the air bombardment at the start of the Iraq war in March 2003. Hagel seconded him. 'Because ISIL operates freely across the Iraqi-Syrian border, and maintains a safe haven in Syria, our actions will not be restrained by a border in name only,' he said. 'I'm asking you to please leave -- you're acting very warlike yourselves!': Democratic Sen. Carl Levin scolded anti-war activists who interrupted his ISIS hearing multiple times . Doing Obama's bidding: Hagel, shown with the president after a Medal of Honor ceremony on Monday, is responsible for implementing his policies -- and taking blame if they fail or if 'mission creep' kicks in . Several lawmakers have their doubts about the United States being pulled into a larger war, with increasing numbers of American troops. The president has already dispatched more than 1,000 Americans three years after combat forces left Iraq. Many Republicans and Democrats have expressed reservations about the ability to identify moderates in a country awash with rebel formations and shifting alliances. The Islamic State grew out of the al-Qaeda movement, but the two are now fighting. In some instances, the moderate Free Syrian Army has teamed with al-Qaeda's local franchise, the Nusra Front. Hagel said the U.S. will monitor them closely to ensure that weapons don't fall into the wrong hands. 'There will always be risk in a program like this, but we believe that risk is justified by the imperative of destroying ISIL – and the necessity of having capable partners on the ground in Syria,' the defense secretary said. Anti-war protesters filled the front rows at the hearing, chanting 'No more war! No more war! No military solution!' at the start of the session and repeatedly interrupting testimony. 'War is not the answer!' one activist yelled as Hagel was introduced. Committee chairman Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, snapped. 'Would you please now leave? I'm asking you to please leave. You're acting very warlike yourself,' Levin told them. Hagel said the involvement will not be 'an easy or brief effort. We are at war with ISIL, as we are with al-Qaeda.' Gen. Dempsey said President Obama 'has told me ... to come back to him on a case-by-case basis' about whether American troops need to escalate their involvement in Iraq . Obama met Tuesday morning in the Oval Office with his new envoy, retired Gen. John Allen (2nd left) and his deputy Brett McGurk (left) along with National Security Adviser Susan Rice (right) Obama and Vice President Joe Biden met in the Oval Office with retired Marine Gen. John Allen, who is coordinating international efforts to combat the Islamic State militants. Brett McGurk, a top Iraq adviser at the State Department, also took part in the meeting. Racing to finish its work and leave Washington for midterm campaigning, House Republicans finalized legislation to authorize the mission to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels. The authorization under consideration will be included as an amendment to a spending bill Congress must pass to keep the government open until mid-December. That would give lawmakers the opportunity to hold a separate debate and vote on the matter – something members of both parties want. Votes could come as early as Wednesday. Bowing to congressional fears that any vote is tantamount to a war vote, the legislation includes a provision stating that 'nothing in this section shall be construed to constitute a specific statutory authorization for the introduction of U.S. armed forces into hostilities or into situations wherein hostilities are clearly indicated by the circumstances.' The provision reflects a congressional divide between hawks seeking tougher action than that proposed by Obama and lawmakers weary from more than a decade of U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The measure compels the Pentagon to present Congress with a plan 15 days before any training begins and requires ongoing updates every 90 days. The U.S. plan is to develop moderate Syrian forces at Saudi Arabian training sites before helping them return to the battlefield. It's unclear how long they would need to be trained to be battle-ready or how the U.S. could ensure their attention remained on fighting extremists and not just the Syrian government.","Gen.

As for what's on the menu, organisers have certainly taken heed of the PM's love of a cuppa, as tea has been available in plentiful supply. No shortage either of baked goods - his staff openly admit that he 'loves a scone' and they've been an omnipresent item at morning teas. NT organisers have promised to throw some 'steaks on the barbecue' for the PM, being one of his favourite Australia dishes but whether he will be tempted by traditional bush tucker, such as the odd witchetty grub, remains to be seen.

Mr Abbott will also get his hands dirty when he takes in a tour of a local nursery, having already taken part in seed planting ceremonies at a timber mill. As ever, the PM is moving at a fast pace, managing to visit and work at both the timber mill and a nearby cattle station, amid some criticism that it's been rather too 'stage-managed'. Locals say the PM should also find time to hear the concerns of 1100 people now out of a job after Rio Tinto's decision to suspend work at its Gove alumina refinery in the Northern Territory - directly affecting almost a quarter of the town's population. Is this how you do it? The PM waits for the order to open the gate at an NT cattle station . This stay was an election promise made by Mr Abbott, in which he said, not only that he would find time to stay with remote communities, but he would bring ministers and parliamentary secretaries along as well. He was greeted on Sunday with a traditional Welcome to Country ceremony by the Yirrkala community on the Gove Peninsula in north-east Arnhem Land by young and old community members.

"Don't mess with Slim Shady. US rapper Eminem is suing a New Zealand political party after it allegedly used his 2002 hit, Lose Yourself, in a TV commercial without permission. The governing National Party has flatly denied the allegations, which concern a catchy riff in their election TV commercial 'Keep The Team That's Working'. Scroll down to listen to the two tunes .

A still from the advertisement, 'Keep The Team That's Working', which Eminem's representatives allege used his classic track, 'Lose Yourself'. In a fiery statement, Eminem's publishers  Eight Mile Style LLC and Martin Affiliated LLC said they were seeking damages for copyright infringement. 'Eminem's publishers were not approached for permission to use any of Eminem's songs for this campaign advertisement,' Mr Martin said. 'It is both disappointing and sadly ironic that the political party responsible for championing the rights of music publishers in New Zealand by the introduction of the 3 strikes copyright reforms should itself have so little regard for copyright.' The statement continued: 'We do not hesitate to take immediate action to protect the integrity of Eminem's works, particularly where a party, as here, has sought to associate itself with Eminem and his work.' Lose Yourself was the theme song for Eminem's biopic 8 Mile. In the driver's seat: Prime Minister John Key has remained firmly ahead in the polls. The rappers agents have announced they will sue the New Zealand National Party. But the National Party said their song was sourced from an Australian-based production outfit. 'The National Party will be defending this action vigorously,' a spokesman told AAP. The party said it was alerted to the copyright infringement complaint two weeks ago and made a compromise to stop using the track. 'However, this has not satisfied the complainant,' the spokesman added. National Party campaign manager Steve Joyce said the party had gone through the required licensing procedures. 'We think it's pretty legal, we think these guys are just having a crack and have a bit of an eye for the main chance because it's an election campaign,' he told reporters. It is the final week of the country's parliamentary election campaign.

"Muslim community leader Keysar Trad has accused the Federal Government of exaggerating the home-grown militants problem. There are reports that Islamic radicals have Australia in their sights and that counter-terror agencies are preparing to lift the country's alert status to high. But the president of the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia (IFAA) says the concerted 'negative campaigns' against the building of mosques is a major part of the problem which has 'radicalised some of our youth'. 'We want to be part of the solution but denying us the ability to build more prayer facilities, enabling us to reach out to those lost souls, is making it too easy for the radical minority to win,' Mr Trad said. Keysar Trad arrives at a recent meeting with the Prime Minister and Attorney-General George Brandis to discuss the home-grown terror threat. 'I wonder whether sometimes they are just shooting in the dark, just don't know the dynamics of the situation are, or don't want a real solution' Attorney-General George Brandis and Prime Minister Tony Abbott have announced a suite of counter-terrorism and border protection measures in the past month worth more than $600 million . 'It was to their credit that we've had these meetings but the government, I wonder whether sometimes they are just shooting in the dark, just don't know the dynamics of the situation are, or don't want a real solution,' Mr Trad said. 'The level of alarm that has been raised I feel is exaggerated. This is a fear of just a handful of individuals. 'Anyone who knows anything about the mindset of these types of people is that when they go to these places that none of them ever really have the intention of coming back.' Among those are Mohammad Ali Baryalei, 33, who once worked as a bouncer for nightclubs in Sydney's Kings Cross party district. Now Australian authorities have identified him as a 'commander' for the so-called militant group the Islamic State, which is causing havoc in Syria and Iraq. Mohammad Ali Baryalei, 33, who once worked as a bouncer in Sydney has been identified as a commander for the so-called militant group the Islamic State . Baryalei's recruits include notorious jihadists Khaled Sharrouf (left) and Mohamed Elomar (right) Baryalei is believed to have recruited as many as 30 Australians into the service of the group Tony Abbott has labelled a 'death cult'. Among the fighters Baryalei has allegedly 'funnelled' into Syria are notorious jihadists Mohamed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf, both from western Sydney. Sharrouf was responsible for a gruesome image of his seven-year-old son wielding a decapitated head in August. Mr Trad claims these type of recruits are lured 'on the basis they are going to some sort of utopian state, which of course it is not'. Amira Karroum, the Gold Coast schoolgirl who followed Baryalei into the war zone and who was killed, along with her husband, during a battle with rival militants in Aleppo . Baryalei is also thought by Australian officials to have been behind the recruitment of Gold Coast private schoolgirl Amira Karroum and her husband Tyler Casey, who held dual Australian-US citizenship. Both were killed in January during a battle with hard-line ISIS militants. 'The reality if that the furtherest thing from the mind of these people is to come back to something that is not that utopia they are looking for,' the IFAA founder added. Mr Trad's life as a Muslim community representative has not been short on controversy, which includes a drawn-out defamation battle with a Sydney radio station in the Supreme Court and being the right-hand man of controversial cleric and former Grand Mufti Sheik Taj Al-Din Alhilali. However, he was invited to meet with the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General recently and came away from those talks doubting that the government really wants input from the Muslim community on possible solutions. Mr Trad's life as a Muslim community representative has not been without controversy, including an eight-year defamation court battle and working alongside former Grand Mufti Sheik Taj Al-Din Alhilali. Islamic Friendship Association President Keysar Trad (standing) at a multi-faith function with controversial cleric and former Grand Mufti Sheik Taj Al-Din Alhilali (second left) and Catholic Bishop Kevin Manning (far right) He says there are scant details available of what the local community programs to eradicate home-grown terror groups look like, telling Daily Mail Australia that a draft report was handed out at the meeting and taken back. 'We were handed a lengthy numbered draft report at the meeting regarding these counter-terror plans,' Mr Trad said. 'We had barely any time to digest the details before it was taken back at the end of the same meeting. We can't tell you what those proposed community programs look like because we, the community leaders, haven't really been involved.' At a meeting of Muslim leaders, Keysar Trad said: 'The reality is that the perception has now been created out there that these laws are aimed at Muslims, despite what the politicians say. We had an argument with the PM and the Attorney-General about this issue.' He has taken issue with proposed new laws where it will be an offence to travel to a country declared by agencies as a terrorist zone without 'a legitimate purpose'. He says they no longer differentiate between those who leave to do humanitarian work and others who depart for more sinister reasons. 'These laws, as we've heard, now provide for the presumption of guilt ahead of innocence,' he said. 'No matter what label you want to give it, it is reversing the onus of proof. 'There's so many unanswered questions, like what is considered humanitarian work or an allowable pilgrimage and then be told it is plausible for an Australian to join the military of a country fighting another state over disputed territory? 'If you are part of an army, we have seen what has taken place in Gaza, and innocent people are killed, then these are war crimes. 'We had an argument over this issue with the PM and the Attorney-General. The reality is that the perception has now been created out there that these laws are aimed at Muslims, despite what the politicians say. 'They should be used against all parts of the community, all religions and faiths. That's not what most Australians think, that's the truth.' 'This is a fear of just a handful of individuals' Keysar Trad has told government officials in meetings . He hopes the local programs flagged by the government include backing for more mosques. ''This is what we face, the dynamics of our community is that we can't reach every single person, the established places of worship that we have just don't have the resources to cater for everybody,' Mr Trad said. Mr Trad says Australia's 500,000 strong Muslim population is equally horrified by the violence wrought by the so-called Islamic State 'they have hijacked an ancient Islamic symbol and it should not be in the hands of such a violent group which does not represent'. 'But every time we want to establish another centre to reach out to more and more young people we face a lot of obstacles. It's the air of suspicion we face on a regular basis. 'A lot who have gone or have been talking about it, you look at their lifestyle their movements before they went. 'All you have to do is look at them, what did they do before they went, were they upstanding citizens or were they people who had serious concerns and had difficulty adjusting to life here in Australia and contributing to society? 'They are people who found it very very difficult to get accepted and belonging to Australia.' There are about 500,000 people of Muslim-background in Australia, representing 2.2 per cent of the population. Mr Trad says they are equally horrified but what has transpired overseas and shattered that 'they (ISIL) have hijacked an ancient Islamic symbol and it should not be in the hands of such a violent group which does not represent'. 'The problem with some of these young people is that they have this anger and suspicion, that they have been neglected. The community has not found a way to deliver services to them' Keysar Trad says of Australian militants who have linked with terror groups overseas . He believes there is only one, albeit small, window of opportunity for the return of radicals. 'If they somehow see the light and view these groups at some point as un-Islamic. 'But that is very unlikely. Once somebody has blood on their hands, it is very hard to make them see differently. 'Once they are in there they think they are an integral member of something which has a goal and an aim.' He says the first step is to stop them being marginalised. 'The problem with some of  these young people is that they have this anger and suspicion, that they have been neglected. The community has not found a way to deliver services to them,' he said. 'But this is a problem which is not too hard to fix.'","Keysar Trad is president of the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia .

Prosecutor Joanne Barker told the court: 'Mary Ryan was not at fault in any way for what happened that night. 'Had he [Hussain] been travelling at the speed limit the collision would not have occurred. 'It is not the prosecution case he was racing with the Mercedes vehicle behind.

"An experimental drug could help millions of women across the world combat cellulite . An experimental drug could help combat the dreaded cellulite that plagues millions of women across the world, new research has revealed. A trial carried out in the U.S. by Auxilium Pharmaceuticals has shown a 'significant improvement' in the appearance of 'orange peel' skin on the thighs and buttocks of the women taking part. Cellulite is a term to describe lumpy, dimpled flesh on the thighs, buttocks and abdomen, and is most common in adolescent and adult women. The new study could provide a ray of hope for those women left feeling self-conscious by the condition, which is not serious but can be unsightly. There are currently no treatments for cellulite in the U.S. that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The study involved 150 women between the ages of 18 and 45. Each participant received up to three treatment sessions of the drug Xiaflex (CCH) or a placebo. The treatment sessions were around 21 days apart and up to 12 injections were administered into the dimpled skin on the buttock or thigh. The findings revealed 68 per cent of those women receiving the high to mid dosage of the drug reported being 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with their cellulite treatment. That compared to just 34 per cent of the patients given the placebo. Cellulite is a localised metabolic disorder of tissue under the skin. It affects between 85 to 98 per cent women, of all ethnicities. The condition can involve the loss of elasticity or shrinking of collagen cords, called 'septae', that attach the skin to the muscle layers below. When fat in cellulite prone areas swells and expands, the septae tether the skin, which causes surface dimpling characteristic of cellulite. Xiaflex works by targeting and breaking those collagen tethers with the goal of reducing the skin dimpling and potentially resulting in the smoothing of the skin. Adrian Adams, chief executive and president of Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, said: 'We continue to be encouraged by the promising and positive results of our program. 'We believe these data establish proof of concerpt for CCH as a potential treatment for cellulite and enable Auxilium to pursue our development and regulatory strategy to most efficiently and effectively advance this exciting program. 'We look forward to initiating a planned Phase 2b clinical trial in the second quarter of 2015.' A trial carried out by Auxilium Pharmaceuticals in the U.S. tested the drug Xiaflex on a study-group of 150 women aged 18 to 45. Of those receiving high to mid doses, 68 per cent reported being 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with their treatment. Pictured is a diagram showing the difference between normal skin and cellulite . James Tursi, chief medical officer of the company, added: 'These data have exceeded our expectations, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in cellulite as measured by both physicians and patients. 'These are challenging endpoints and ones that we believe are critical in the context of regulatory consideration. 'We are continuing to analyse these exciting data and will be gathering key opinion leader and regulatory input and look forward to publishing and presenting our findings in peer-reviewed venues in the future.' Despite multiple therapeutic approaches for the attempted treatment of cellulite, there are no FDA-approved treatments and little scientific evidence that any current treatments are beneficial. Xiaflex is a medicine manufactured from biological sources, that already has FDA approval, as well as approval in Europe, Canada and Australia for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture - a progressive hand disease that prevents the patient from straightening and properly using their fingers. It is also FDA approved to treat men with curvature of the penis, a condition known as Peyronie's disease.","U.S. firm Auxilium Pharmaceuticals trialled the drug Xiaflex on 150 women .

"A controversial bookstore in Sydney's west has closed its doors as its owner Wissam Haddad - a school friend of convicted Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf - claims 90 per cent of his clientele gets harassed by ASIO. Mr Haddad said he made the choice to shutdown Bankstown's Al Risalah Centre due to financial reasons.

Wissam Haddad has closed down his Islamic bookstore in Bankstown, in Sydney's west . Mr Haddad is friends with Australian convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf is believed to be in Syria . Earlier this year, the fireband owner caused controversy after he defended Sharrouf when the terrorist posted a photo of a child - believed to be his son - holding up a severed head on social media. Mr Haddad told the ABC the new anti-terror laws touted by the government would target innocent Australian Muslims. 'Ninety per cent of people who come here have been visited by ASIO,' he said. 'My family members have been hassled and the family members of people who are regulars have also been hassled.' Khaled Sharrouf's son, believed to be aged seven, had to use both hands to hoist the decapitated head up as he posed for a chilling photo in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa . Sharrouf (right) posted photos of himself and a boy he claimed was his son holding a decapitated head . Mr Haddad - who is a supporter of terrorist organisation Islamic State - said ASIO had quizzed his associates about how the Al Risalah Centre was funded, what was taught and if he was connected to anyone overseas.

"An independent Scotland would be defended by a part-time air force, military analysts said yesterday. They suggested that the limited defence spending that would follow independence means the new country would be forced to run an air force that could operate only in office hours.

Scotland would claim 12 modern Typhoon fighters like the ones pictured above after a Yes vote. File image . The Swiss air force has aircraft ready to fly during office hours on weekdays only, because spending limits and shortage of pilots and personnel means it cannot fly around the clock. Austria has 12 modern Typhoon fighters – the same number Scotland would claim from the rest of the UK after a Yes vote – and operates them between 8am and 4pm. Lack of air defence capacity in Scotland would force RAF aircraft to intervene in the event of an out-of-hours emergency, for example the arrival in Scottish airspace of a hijacked airliner. The Scottish government has said it plans to spend £2.5billion a year on defence. It would claim two frigates and four minehunters from the Royal Navy, together with the Typhoons to be handed over by the RAF. After a decade of independence, it plans to have a standing army of 15,000. Mr Hunt said: ‘There is a danger of a limited Scottish defence budget resulting in what can be considered a very hollow force. ‘Such limitations on military capabilities are precisely why the US is likely to view independence as further fragmentation of European defence capabilities.’ Lack of air defence would force RAF aircraft to intervene in the event of an out-of-hours emergency.

"A Georgetown University student has pleaded guilty to possessing the deadly toxin ricin after allegedly getting inspiration from Breaking Bad - where it is used as a poison. Daniel H. Milzman, 19, admitted to keeping the substance, which can be used in biological warfare, in his desk drawer in the McCarthy Hall student accommodation at the Washington D.C. campus. He accepted the charge of having the material without a federally-required registration during a 30-minute plea hearing at a U.S. District Court today, while wearing an orange jumpsuit. Daniel H. Milzman, 19, admitted to keeping the substance, which can be used as a biological weapon, in his desk drawer inside Georgetown University's McCarthy Hall student accommodation (pictured) Milzman was arrested in March after telling his friend, a student adviser, he had made the substance in during a school break and had stashed it in his room. According to the Washington Post, he bought castor beans, the oil of which is used to make the dangerous substance, from a store in Bethedsa, Maryland, where he had lived with his parents., . The adviser then asked Milzman whether he intended to use it against another student whom he had previously been in a relationship with. But Milzman just shrugged, and his friend left to call the police. Officers arrived the next day and were led to the package in his drawer. Law enforcement confirmed that beforehand, Milzman had also searched for ricin-related terms online while watching various episodes of the television show. During today's hearing, U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. said: 'Daniel Milzman put himself and others in danger by cooking up a deadly poison. He is very lucky that none of his fellow students were hurt.' The charge carries a penalty of a fine of up to $250,000 and a prison term of up to five years.

"The Prime Minister has drawn a line in the sand with students and youth unemployed today, telling them to 'pull your weight' as he made it clear there will be no softening of the government's Work for the Dole program. 'I want to see every Australian pulling his or her weight. That's very important,' Mr Abbott said. There was an outcry from students and welfare groups after the May Budget, when Treasurer Joe Hockey announced the overhaul of Work for the Dole and unemployment benefits. 'Pull your weight'. Tony Abbott has today signalled no softening of the Work for the Dole scheme . An angry St Vincent de Paul Society CEO Dr John Falzon said: 'You don't help young help people into work by forcing them to live below the poverty line and you certainly don't help them into a job by forcing them to rely on charity to survive' But the Prime Minister fired another salvo today. 'The last thing we want is to see young people leaving school and going on to unemployment benefits,' the Prime Minister said. St Vincent de Paul Society CEO, Dr John Falzon, hit back: 'What we had hoped for was a jobs plan, what we have got instead is a bashing the young unemployed plan.' The PM said that school leavers did not have to rely on the dole 'particularly when there is going to be a stronger training system and more effective system in the future, than there has been in the past.' He said the government has missed the point and the labour market structure is the problem, not those seeking work. 'You don't help young help people into work by forcing them to live below the poverty line and you certainly don't help them into a job by forcing them to rely on charity to survive,' Dr Falzon added. The PM said that school leavers did not have to rely on the dole 'particularly when there is going to be a stronger training system and more effective system in the future, than there has been in the past.' From the start of 2015, new job-seekers under the age of 30 will have to wait up to six months before receiving unemployment benefits. Further, they will then have to participate in at least 25 hours per week under Work for the Dole, to receive any payments for the next six months. 'The problem is structural but the government insists on using the language of demonising and blame to the very people who are suffering the affects of that structure,' Dr Falzon added. A national day of action is planned by tertiary students to protest against the Work for the Dole changes and education overhaul. From the start of 2015, new job-seekers under the age of 30 will have to wait up to six months before receiving unemployment benefits.","The Prime Minister tells students 'pull your weight' and take on more training if they can't get a job .

"Wolfe pictured here at the internment camp where he was held . When American pilot Roland Wolfe crashed his British Spitfire into a peat bog in Ireland during World War Two, few thought it would ever be seen again. The pilot who bailed out immediately wanted to climb into the cockpit of another military aircraft and continue fighting for the allies. Knowing that his fighter was doomed, the young RAF Officer had radioed: 'I'm going over the side' before parachuting to safety moments before impact. But instead of fighting again the serviceman was interned in a camp - where captured UK and U.S. troops mixed freely with the German enemy. Despite managing to escape Ireland, neutral during the war, and make his way back to Britain, the 23-year-old was sent back to the camp. Fearing a diplomatic row, the British Government returned Wolfe to the most relaxed of 'prison' camps in Ireland where he was kept for a further two years. The pilot from Nebraska had been stripped of his U.S. citizenship after agreeing to fight for the British because the Americans had not yet joined the war. Now almost 70 years after the pilot from the 133 'Eagle' Squadron crash-landed in the north of Ireland in November 1941, his crashed plane has been recovered. The Spitfire was the first of 20 made with a donation from a Canadian millionaire called Willard Garfield Weston who wanted to support the Allies in the Battle of Britain with a £100,000 donation. Remarkably large parts of the plane have been recovered from the bog. Six . machine guns and about 1,000 rounds of ammunition were also discovered . by archaeologists searching the Inishowen Peninsula in Co Donegal. American Spitfire pilot Roland 'Bud' Wolfe lost his U.S. citizenship in 1941 when he signed up to fight for the RAF . The excavation was carried out as part of a BBC Northern Ireland programme. Historian Dan Snow said: 'The plane itself is obviously kind of wreckage and the big pieces survived. We're expecting to find things like the engine and there still may be personal effects in the cockpit. 'It's just incredible because it's just so wet here that the ground just sucked it up and the plane was able to burrow into it and it's been preserved. 'It's in amazing condition,' he told RTE radio. A team of Irish recruits at the Curragh Camp, just outside Dublin, where Wolfe was held for two years during World War Two . Historian Dan Snow led the project to dig the Spitfire out of the peat bog almost 70 years after the pilot bailed out of the doomed plane . Mr Snow said Mr Wolf was forced to . abandon his Spitfire over the Republic when its engine overheated about . 13 miles from his base at RAF Eglinton, now Derry International Airport, . in Northern Ireland. Aviation archeologist Simon Parry . told the Irish Independent that it was highly significant that the . doomed plane had been recovered. 'The . pilot was lucky to survive that day because if his engine had failed a . few minutes earlier he would have ended up in the sea,' he said. Landing on neutral soil, the 23-year-old pilot was interned at Curragh detention camp in Co Kildare for two years. With fishing trips, fox hunts and football matches it sounded almost like a holiday camp - and seemingly the ideal place to be holed up as war raged across the rest of Europe. The guards were only issued with blank rounds, visitors were permitted and there were frequent excursions to nearby pubs. Around 40 RAF pilots who crashed in Ireland were held in the corrugated iron huts alongside the German enemy. The crew of destroyed U-boats and Luftwaffe planes also ended up at the camp. The warring nations even played football matches against each other - with the Germans defeating the largely English team 8-3, in a precursor to their repeated post-war footballing triumphs over their North Atlantic enemy. Spitfires fly over Britain - the recovered fighter had been remarkably well preserved by the bog . But although servicemen were free to come and go from the camp Wolfe, who died in 1994, was determined to fight on. In December 1941, just two weeks . after his crash, the serviceman made his way into Dublin before hopping . onto a train to Belfast which was British territory. As his doomed plane came down he parachuted out before watching it plunge into the ground half a mile away. Although . he made his way back to RAF Eglinton, he was returned to the Irish camp . where he spent a further two years before it was closed. Belatedly . he got his wish, and in 1943 he was allowed to return to frontline . action as the tide of the war turned in the Allies direction. It is only because of the unusually soft ground that the crashed Spitfire could be recovered in the 70th year after the crash. The . Irish Defence Forces said the six Browning .303 machine guns and . approximately 1,000 rounds of ammunition were discovered by a team of . archaeologists from Queens University buried up to 30 feet in the bog. 'The . six machine guns and ammunition have been removed by the bomb disposal . team to a secure military location where they will be decommissioned and . cleaned before being handed over to the Derry Museum,' a spokesman . added. The plane will now be preserved and go on display at the Tower Museum in Derry.","Recovered Spitfire 'one of the first ever made'

"Rory McIlroy and Adam Scott walk the fairways together at the Memorial tournament in Ohio on Thursday at the start of what everyone, from the Northern Irishman downwards, hopes will be a summer-long rivalry. In Houston last month, the 25-year-old, wearing his fan’s hat, said he thought the game was lacking something in the absence of a heavyweight contest. In the swing: Rory McIlroy is keen to build up a rivalry with Adam Scott as he tees off in Ohio on Wednesday . ‘I think it would be great if we got back to the sort of rivalry we’ve seen in the past,’ said McIlroy. ‘When you look at the Tiger and Phil effect, wouldn’t it be great if we got back to something like that?’ At the time, both Scott and McIlroy had just blown tournaments in Florida. ‘No disrespect to the players who won but Adam and myself, players who have won majors and dealt with pressure, should be closing those tournaments out,’ he said. ‘We should be stepping up to the plate.’ Last weekend, on the best Sunday of the golfing year, both did just that with McIlroy winning in sensational style at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth and newly crowned world No1 Scott equally impressive in outlasting USPGA champion Jason Dufner in a play-off in Texas. Top of the tree: Adam Scott is the new World No 1 in the run up to the US Open . Now the pair compete in their final event before next month’s US Open at Pinehurst. Organisers have seized the opportunity to pair them up. ‘They’re both so talented and in form so it should be fun to watch,’ said event host Jack Nicklaus. As for the lingering fascination with his split from fiancee Caroline Wozniacki, McIlroy would not comment on reports he broke up from the Danish tennis star in a three-minute phone call. ‘I’m here to talk about my golf,’ he said. Also competing in Ohio are Justin Rose, who puts his major title on the line in a fortnight, and Luke Donald, who became a father for the third time last week.

"A man who stepped into traffic and then set himself on fire in an apparent suicide attempt has been connected to a woman found dead in a Cleveland home, authorities said. Hugo Ramos, who was in critical condition at a Cleveland hospital, is a homicide suspect in the death of a 25-year-old woman, Cleveland police said today. Her name and cause of death have not yet been released. Ramos, 28, told officers where her body could be found. Murder suspect Hugo Ramos, 28, allegedly abandoned three children in this car by the side of an Ohio highway then walked into traffic before attempting to set himself on fire on Monday . Officers forced their way into a home shortly before 3pm and found the body. Ramos pulled his car to the side of U.S. Route 20 in Lorain County, about 35 miles west of Cleveland, around 10.50am on Monday with three small children inside, the Ohio State Highway Patrol said. The children - aged seven, four and one - were not injured, Chronicle Online reported. At least one of them is believed to belong to Ramos, investigators said. Ramos then stepped in front of a large truck and was struck, authorities said. After that, he managed to get up and retrieve from his car a container filled with what authorities believe was gasoline. Ramos swallowed some of the gas, poured the remainder on his clothes and set himself on fire as the children sat in the car, investigators said. A bystander rushed over and put out the fire. Ramos was flown to Mercy Allen Hospital in Oberlin  where he was under police guard on Tuesday. Officials say 28-year-old Hugo Ramos got a container of gasoline from his car, swallowed some of it, poured the rest on his body and then set himself on fire .","Hugo Ramos, who was in critical condition at a Cleveland hospital, is a homicide suspect in the death of a 25-year-old woman, police said today .

"In what could be described as one of the most creative and original proposals ever, a man has popped the question to his girlfriend of four and a half years, through Scoopon. Sydney's Steve Brisson wanted to take the next step with his girlfriend Sayaka Shoji but didn't want to do it any old way, coming up with a crazy and elaborate plan, he knew she would love. So Steve decided to give Sayaka, who was hooked on Scoopon, a website which offers great discounts, a deal she couldn't refuse. SCROLL DOWN TO VIDEO . The happy couple : Steve brisson (right) and Sayaka Shoji (left) are now engaged after an elaborate proposal which offered her a deal to marry Steve on Scoopon . Steve(right) and Sayaka(left) have been dating for four and a half years and Steve wanted to take the next step by proposing, but in a very different way . 'I was looking at Sayaka on the couch, and she was checking Scoopon, Scoopon is like her second relationship, she loves it,' Steve told News.com.au. 'We cannot go anywhere without checking on Scoopon, we go to restaurants based on what deals she’s got on Scoopon. And I thought, that’s what I’ll do. I’ll use Scoopon.' The next step was setting up the interesting plan and the 33 year old decided to document it all from start to finish. In a youtube video he is first seen getting ready for the big night ahead, 'much to do to get ready for the big night,' he said. Steve had many plans to organise for the top secret mission, including picking a restaurant, an Indian restaurant was the one, and calling Scoopon to see if they would help him put up a 'Spend your whole life with a guy who is crazy about you' deal. Of course they agreed. 'First up, I styled the proposal like I was the deal, it was a lifetime opportunity, no exchange, things like that,' he told News.com.au. Steve (pictured) calling Scoopon to see if they will help him with his plan and put up a deal that ends with Will you marry me .

Steve Brisson (right) and now finance Sayaka Shoji (left) have been dating for four and a half years . Top secret mission : to explain the cameras at the restaurant he picked to propose he got the restaurant to write a fake notice . But The 33 year old Sydneysider went even further to make the moment, one of the most memorable for his girlfriend, he even got the restaurant to write a notice explaining why there would be a number of cameras there, when they dined. It read that the restaurant had been chosen as one of the top Indian restaurants in Sydney and they would be featured in a media story. It then said they were looking for local patrons, who knew loved their food, to come in and have dinner while they were shooting in the restaurant. Nervous and excited about what was about to happen, the video then goes on to see Steve excuse himself to go to the bathroom, hoping Sayaka would then check Scoopon for a juicy deal. She did of course, and was shocked in disbelief about what she was reading. 'Sayaka, the past four and a half years have been the best time in my life. I feel that I have found my best friend,' Steve said in the Scoopon article. Sayaka (pictured) had no idea when they arrived to eat at the Indian restaurant what was just about to happen . Steve left to go to the bathroom, hoping Sayaka (pictured) would check Scoopon to reveal the proposal. She did . Sayaka (pictured) smiles as she is starting to read through the personalised Scoopon deal. Steve (pictured in background) is waiting for her to read until the end so he can get down on bended knee .

'You love me and challenge me in ways I never thought possible and as soon as we met I knew that you were someone special.' 'We have seen so much of the world together but I know there is so much more adventure ahead of us. So the next part of that adventure starts right now,' he said. Then there was a big picture of Steve jumping into the air and the words 'Will you marry me'? Arriving back from the bathroom, Steve waited patiently for her to finish reading and then got down on bended knee and repeated the question, which she answered, YES. Another quirky addition to the Sccopon deal, included a few details in fine print, because every deal has fine print. It gave a list of things she may experience for the duration of the deal including, someone that doesn't washes the dishes as well as you do, someone who is obsessed with UFC and all sports as well as someone that can annoy you more than anyone else in the world. 'You love me and challenge me in ways I never thought possible and as soon as we met I knew that you were someone special,' Steve (left) wrote in his Scoopon proposal to Sayaka (right) The camera gets ready to film Sayaka (pictured) and her response to the proposal on Scoopon . After reading the Scoopon proposal, Steve gets down on bended knee to ask Sayaka properly, Will you marry me? She said yes . The whole event, documented on camera, saw the couple embrace after the elaborate proposal, ready to start celebrating. But the happy couple did keep the announcement under wraps for a little while longer. 'My mother’s not well, so we decided to surprise her at this event we were having for her on Saturday night,' Steve said. 'It was ridiculous, she thought it was the coolest thing!' Steve took to social media to spread his happiness about how well the plan went down and that Sayaka said yes. 'So, last week was kind of a big week. I can now let everyone know that after a TOP SECRET mission lasting months, that Sayaka and I are now engaged,' he posted on Facebook. 'We are absolutely thrilled and very excited. Big thanks to Scoopon Australia for making this such a great surprise.' The couple have not yet set a wedding date but here's wondering if it will be anything as elaborate as his proposal.

"Two weeks after Tiarna Middleton was born, her mother still has not been able to hold her daughter in her arms. In desperate need of a transplant, the baby has become the youngest in the world to be fitted with an artificial heart – and all her parents can do is hold her hand as she fights for life. Weighing 5lb 8oz, Tiarna was born with a rare condition that meant she was missing vital coronary arteries and the right side of her heart had not grown at all. Parents Sharney Gray, 22, and Gary Middleton, 25, launched an appeal to . encourage people to join the organ donor register in a bid to help find a . donor for their daughter, and Tiarna became both the youngest and smallest baby on the UK transplant waiting list. Tiarna Middleton, 13 days old, has become the youngest person in the UK to be fitted with an artificial heart . Tiarna was born with a serious heart condition and remains desperately ill. Image shows her parents, Sharney Gray and Gary Middleton and her brother, Jamie . But no suitable donors have been found . – and yesterday doctors pulled off a medical first by fitting the . 14-day-old with a ‘Berlin heart’ during a delicate ten-hour operation at . the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle. The 33lb machine supports the work of the heart and acts as a life-saving bridging device for children awaiting a transplant. Mr . Middleton, a freelance courier, said: ‘We have been on a total . emotional rollercoaster and are taking each day as it comes. Tiarna is . doing well in the circumstances.’ Tiarna . was born with an extremely rare condition called hypoplastic right . heart syndrome, which meant she had a blocked heart valve in the artery . going to the lungs. She . was kept alive initially by an ECMO machine, which takes over the work . of the heart and puts oxygen in the blood. In the meantime, Tiarna was . urgently listed for heart transplantation. To save her life, she would . need the heart of a baby aged three months or younger. Tiarna's parents are urging people to join the organ donor register in a bid to help their daughter and other people in a similar position to her . The child's mother said today:  'Anything can happen in the next 48 hours. She has nothing left to try so we hope this works.' But . ECMO is suitable only for short-term support, and with no donors . available and time running out, surgeons decided to try to fit a Berlin . heart as a last resort. They used a new small version of the device, . delivered from The Berlin Heart Company in Germany where it is made. Miss . Gray said: ‘She’s the smallest person they’ve tried that  on. She has . nothing left to try  so we hope this works. The  doctors at the Freeman . have done everything for her.’ The . couple from Gateshead, who already have a two-year-old son, Jamie, were . told Tiarna would be born with a heart condition when she was in the . womb and were asked if they wanted to continue with the pregnancy. Tiarna was given the device during a 10 hour operation yesterday. It is hoped it will keep her alive long enough for a donor heart to be found so she can have a transplant . A Berlin . heart is a device which can be used in people whose hearts are not . strong enough to pump enough blood around their bodies. It is used to allow time for a donor heart to be found. It is an air driven pump which takes over the work of the person's own heart. It can be used to take over the work of one or both sides of the heart. The Berlin heart consists of a plastic chamber which sits outside the body. It has a . blood filled side and an air filled side and the blood filled side of . the pump is connected directly to the child's own heart and main artery . by two tubes. It can be used for as long as several months but a person cannot remain on it indefinitely. Source: Great Ormond Street . Miss . Gray, a stay-at-home mother to their son, said: ‘We knew it was a very . serious and very rare condition but I could feel her kicking so I wasn’t . going to get rid of her.’ Tiarna . was delivered by caesarean and doctors soon discovered that her . coronary arteries had failed to form. Miss Gray said: ‘She was screaming . for seven hours and we thought she was OK but then she started to have . difficulty breathing and they had to perform CPR on her for 38 minutes.’ Medics said the Berlin . heart would keep Tiarna alive for longer than an ECMO machine could . have. It is possible to survive for as long as a year with the device, . but Richard Kirk, consultant paediatric cardiologist and transplant . physician at the Freeman Hospital, explained that was not desirable as . the baby has to remain in hospital. A heart transplant is still the only long-term solution for Tiarna. Miss . Gray said: ‘Now we are  just hoping someone will provide her with a . heart, someone could save her life. We’re in a really  difficult . position. ‘Babies under two . months can’t be organ donors in this country. She could take the heart . of a baby up to three months old but it all depends on weight and size. Time is just running out.’ She . added: ‘I haven’t even held her, all I’ve been able to do is hold her . hand. It is really frustrating. I can touch her but not pick her up.’ Dr Richard Kirk said: ‘We need to find a donor for her to go home and live a healthy and normal life.’","Tiarna Middleton was born with a serious heart condition 13 days ago .

"A serial murderer and rapist has been given the right to end his life under controversial Belgian euthanasia laws, it has emerged. Frank Van Den Bleeken, 50, has been behind bars for 30 years and has no hope of release because of his intensely violent urges. Now judges in Brussels have agreed that Van Den Bleeken can commit suicide with the help of medics. Jos Vander Velpen, the prisoner’s lawyer, said: ‘Over recent years, he has been seen by several doctors and psychologists and their conclusion is that he is suffering, and suffering unbearably.’ Scroll down for video . Nearing the end: Frank Van Den Bleeken, 50, has been behind bars for 30 years and has no hope of release because of his intensely violent urges. He has now been give the right to end his life . It will be the first time that a Belgian legal ruling about euthanasia which specifically applies to a serving prisoner has been handed down. It was rubber stamped by the country’s Justice Ministry, which is ultimately responsible for everyone serving time in jail. In all cases, patients must be conscious and have presented a ‘voluntary, considered and repeated’ request to die. Mr Vander Velpen said his client met all such conditions, and for the past four years had felt he ‘couldn’t stand to live like this any longer and could no longer accept the pain’. Van Den Bleeken will be transferred from his prison in Bruges to a hospital, where he will be euthanised. Belgium made euthanasia legal in 2002, making it only the second country in the world to do so after Holland. Pictured, the Belgian Parliament building in Brussels . Like every other country in the Union, Belgium does not have a death penalty, and technically doctors will only be helping Van Den Bleeken die. Van Den Bleeken himself said in recent TV documentary: ‘If people commit a sexual crime, help them to deal with it. Just locking them up helps no one - neither the individual, society or the victims. ‘I am a human being, and regardless of what I’ve done, I remain a human being. So, yes, give me euthanasia.’ Despite being a mainly Roman Catholic country, Belgium has always been at the forefront of liberalising euthanasia laws. It made euthanasia legal in 2002, making it only the second country in the world to do so after Holland. Last year alone, Belgium euthanised a record 1,807 people. Van Den Bleeken has only left prison once in the past three decades – to attend his mother’s funeral. A Belgian justice ministry spokesman said Van Den Bleeken would be euthanised ‘shortly’ at this own request. In February, Belgium became the second country in the world to authorise the killing of terminally ill children – sparking huge protests among religious and other groups. Holland allows euthanasia for children aged 12 and over, while Belgium has lifted all restrictions.","Frank Van Den Bleeken, 50, has been behind bars for 30 years .

"A British holidaymaker has received nearly £3,000 in compensation from Thomas Cook after he contracted E. coli while staying at a Tunisian resort. Carl Pallant, from Horsham, West Sussex, became so sick that he had to be admitted to hospital for several days following his visit to the Vincci Taj Sultan hotel in June 2013. The 29-year-old and his girlfriend booked the getaway through Thomas Cook and he reported that breakdowns in hygiene standards were rife within the resort’s restaurants. Yasmine Hammamet is a popular tourist destination in Tunisia thanks to its location on the Mediterranean Sea . Mr Pallant said in a statement that food was often served undercooked and birds were flying around the open buffet restaurants where food was uncovered. He said: ‘The conditions in the restaurant were really poor … I noticed bird faeces on tablecloths and birds landing on tables and chairs.’ His symptoms, including diarrhoea and stomach cramps, surfaced about two weeks after he returned to the UK, which is a normal timeframe for E. coli. He told the West Sussex County Times: ‘I went back to work for a week. It takes about two weeks for it to take effect. ‘By the second week I was really ill. It was awful, it was really awful. I have never been so ill in my life.’ When he was admitted to hospital, doctors weren’t sure what was wrong with him and they administered various tests over four days. They eventually determined that he had contracted E. coli on his holiday in the tourist resort of Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia. An E. coli infection can be caused by food that has been undercooked or washed in water which may have been contaminated by human or animal faeces. Holidaymaker Carl Pallant contracted E. coli while staying at a resort in Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia . Thomas Cook agreed to pay £2,935 in compensation to Mr Pallant, who filed a claim against the tour operator with Your Holiday Claims. In a statement, Thomas Cook said it is sorry that he fell ill while on holiday and it has extended an apology. The tour operator said: ‘We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, as Thomas Cook closely audits all the properties to which it operates to ensure that only the very highest hygiene standards are maintained. ‘We would kindly ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner.’","Carl Pallant, from Horsham, stayed at the Vincci Taj Sultan in June 2013 .

"A former National Australia Bank employee and a public servant have pleaded guilty to a $7 million insider trading scheme. Former NAB worker Lukas James Kamay and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) employee Christopher Russell Hill traded confidential market-sensitive information that netted about $7 million in profits. Kamay, 26, and Hill, 24, both pleaded guilty to six charges in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday. Kamay, 26, and Hill, 24, both pleaded guilty to six charges in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday for insider trading . Police allege that Hill, of Belconnen in the ACT, used his position with the ABS to access data on the labour force and retail trade to predict fluctuations in the Australian dollar before it was made publicly available. He then passed it to his university friend Kamay in Melbourne, who used the information to make foreign exchange derivative trades. Kamay and Hill are friends from Monash University and are accused of making net profit of $6.98 million over eight months between August last year and May this year by using advanced knowledge of government data. Hill used his position as  Canberra-based ABS employee to allegedly give Kamay information about official data releases on jobs, building approvals, capital expenditure and retail sales. Documents tendered to the court show Kamay bought an Albert Park unit featured on TV show The Block for $2.375 million. Kamay and Hill appeared in Melbourne Magistrates Court where they pleaded guilty to six charges . Kamay allegedly offered Hill $50,000 to give him the ABS data and would use this information to 'predict fluctuations in the Australian dollar'. He would buy foreign exchange derivative contracts minutes before the ABS's data release at 11.30am and would sell them shortly afterwards. The men were arrested in May as part of a joint AFP and ASIC investigation. Hill worked at the NAB's foreign exchange desk . Kamay, of Clifton Hill, worked for NAB in Melbourne on the foreign exchange desk but was not involved in derivatives trading, while Hill started with the ABS in January 2011 as a technical statistics expert preparing labour force and employment reports. After Hill was charged, The Australian Bureau of Statistics admitted it was difficult to counter the threat of a trusted insider leaking market-sensitive information. At a Senate estimates hearing on earlier this year ABS acting statistician Jonathan Palmer defended security protocols in place, describing the breach as unprecedented in the bureau's 100-year history. ""Fortunately in this case police were clear that this person acted alone,"" he said. ""That gives me some level of confidence."" The bureau has recruited Belinda Gibson, former deputy chair of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, to conduct a review. Staff must sign undertakings and declarations when they begin employment to show they are aware they risk jail if they leak sensitive information. Mr Palmer said there were strict access controls on sensitive information and the bureau reviews access logs. They were granted bail to face a directions hearing in the Victorian Supreme Court on October 1.

"The quest for the perfect selfie has led one California park to become overrun with thousands of hikers who are eroding the trails and overwhelming paramedics with emergency calls for dehydration and sprained ankles. Mission Peak in Fremont, California used to be a quiet park a few years ago, but ever since the rise of social media, the mountain peak has become a destination for inexperienced hikers looking to take pictures of the view and pose by the summit pole. 'Some days it's like a rock concert,' East Bay Regional Park Supervisor Gordon Willey told SFGate. 'Ten years ago this was just a quiet little park. But now, with social media, for some reason, it's just blowing up.' Scroll down for video . Extreme: A once-quiet California peak has recently become overrun with inexperienced hikers looking to take selfies at the summit . The view from above: Local officials estimate that 3,000 people make the trek up Mission Peak in Fremont on busy weekends, which is much more than the 500 it's designed to host . However, the trail is certainly not easy for those who are not used to the workout. It's three miles long up 2,000 feet, and no shade along the way to take breaks on 90-degree summer days. On busy weekends, health officials estimate that they are called to the trail to treat four or five people, usually suffering from twisted ankles, dehydration or heat stroke. And many bring their pets. Last summer, five dogs tragically died climbing up the peak with their masters. 'There's no shade, and no water, and sometimes people overestimate their abilities. They get halfway up and then we get a phone call,' said district police Lt Lance Brede. 'It pulls our resources away from other things.' Popualr: On busy summer weekends, local paramedics estimate they are called to the trail four to five times a day for people suffering from sprained ankles, dehydration and heatstroke . Dangerous: There is no shade to take a break out of the sun on the way up the trail. Last summer, five dogs died walking up the peak with their masters . Problems: Local officials are thinking of charging parking on the weekends and taking the summit pole down to curb the peak's popularity . Other issues include people taking shortcuts off the trail, leading to erosion on the mountain side. Neighbors are also complaining about the serious traffic up and down the trail. On weekends, the peak can average 3,000 visitors a day when the park is really only designed to accommodate 500 people at most. The mountain keeps getting more and more popular, with many looking to pose on the grafittied summit pole. 'That's why we're here. We want to take Facebook pictures,' Sidney Salenga, a chef from San Jose, told the Gate before his ascent on Wednesday. 'I saw some people posted pictures from the very top, and I thought, I want to go there.' To combat the growing problem of traffic on the trail, local authorities have started enforcing a curfew and have put up signs at the trailhead, warning hikers to bring water and proper shoes. They are also considering charging parking fees on the weekend and removing the pole from the summit, where several people have posed for their pictures.","An estimated 3,000 hikers visit Mission Peak in Fremont, California on summer weekend days .

"Witnesses say that there's a woman to blame after a fight broke out in front of a Nashville Margaritaville. Sommer Trent, 33, was arrested early Sunday morning after police say she tried to choke her husband because he wouldn't buy her a hat. According to the Charleston Daily Mail, Trent and her husband Jeff West were visiting from West Virginia to see the Tennessee Titans game against the Dallas Cowboys. Trouble in paradise: Sommer Trent, 33, was in Nashville with her husband Jeff West, 41, when she allegedly assaulted him because he wouldn't buy her a hat . Trent had to miss the game because she was in lockup in Davidson County. Police responded to the scene in downtown Nashville after onlookers said they saw Trent attempting to choke West. Trent had flown into a rage because West refused to buy her a cowboy hat, yelling at him and knocking his own cowboy hat into the street. Bystanders restrained Trent after she put her hands around her husband's neck, though police say he had no trouble breathing during the ordeal. Fans: The couple was in town to watch the Titans take on the Cowboys, a game Trent did not make it out of prison to see .

"It's a once in a lifetime opportunity that most would only dream about. But for Australia's very own Tim Gibson, he has the golden ticket to turn his long-lasting wish into a reality. The 29-year-old is no astronaut but not only is he heading outer space next year, he will also be the youngest Australian to travel beyond Earth. Melbourne resident Tim Gibson will be the youngest Australian to travel to space early next year . Mr Gibson was among 106 finalists sent to the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida to undergo in a rigorous week of tests by NASA in December for the worldwide competition run by the Lynx Space Academy. For Mr Gibson, a  hotel manager in Melbourne, flying to space has been a life-long passion. 'I could fly a plane before I knew how to drive and that's when I was about 15-years-old,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'So I've always been fascinated by space and the sky.' But while he's always dreamt of a career in piloting fighter jets for the Royal Australian Air Force, his eyesight failed him in pursuing his ultimate ambition. 'I got through to the point of enlistment but got declined after my eye test,' he said. 'I appealed that five times so that's how bad I wanted it.' So when the next best thing came along - if not better - he seized the opportunity with both hands. The 29-year-old, a former student from Griffith University in Queensland, says this is a dream come true . Mr Gibson will be documenting his once in a lifetime trip on his blog: www.timfinityandbeyond.com . Mr Gibson thought all hope was lost, until he saw an ad on TV which spoke to him directly. 'Do you want to go to space?' it asked. Mr Gibson's answer? Yes, he did. Mr Gibson (right) with astronaut Buzz Aldrin (left) 'I went out and bought nine cans of Lynx deodorant cans so I could enter the competition - I was pretty keen,' he said. From one million entrants, Mr Gibson is the only Australian among the lucky 23 people selected to lift off for the space mission early next year. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, was on hand to offer his congratulations to Mr Gibson in Florida. 'It's been an incredible experience so far - I never thought I'd ever meet someone like Buzz Aldrin let alone fly to space,' Mr Gibson said. 'I'm still pinching myself about it because I'm also the youngest Aussie to be flying to space. 'I can't wait to see those images of space with my very own eyes and yes, it's going to be the selfie to end all selfies.' The flight is scheduled to take off near Florida, powered by four liquid hydrogen rocket boosters. 'So we'll accelerate three times the speed of sound in under 60 seconds,' Mr Gibson said. 'I'll probably spend about 10 minutes in outer space, so the whole thing will be over in about an hour.' In the meantime, he's going to enjoy the ride with a whole new perspective. 'I hope to work in aerospace in the future,' Mr Gibson said. 'It's my passion and if I can't fly fighter jets, I'm still going to chase the dream. 'There's no better feeling of being up in the air. It just feels like I belong there.'","Tim Gibson is among the 23 selected for the worldwide competition run by the Lynx Space Academy .

"The calls to 911 raised an instant alarm: One caller said he shot his co-workers at a Colorado video game company and had hostages. Another in Florida said her father was drunk, wielding a machine gun and threatening their family. A third caller on New York's Long Island claimed to have killed his mother and threatened to shoot first responders. In each case, SWAT teams dispatched to the scene found no violent criminals or wounded victims — only video game players sitting at their computers, the startled victims of a hoax known as 'swatting.' Scroll down for video . Swatting: Video gamer pranksters are sending SWAT teams to their opponents homes using fake 911 calls about active shooters in sick prank called 'swatting.' Here, Nassau County police officers enter a home in Long Beach, N.Y., in search of an armed killer, based on a phone call that turned out to be a hoax . Authorities say the hoax that initially targeted celebrities has now become a way for players of combat-themed video games to retaliate against opponents while thousands of spectators watch. The perpetrators can watch their hijinks unfold minute by minute in a window that shows a live video image of other players. 'It's like creating your own episode of 'Cops,' said Dr. John Grohol, a research psychologist who studies online behavior, referring to the long-running reality TV show that follows officers on patrol. The players, who are often many miles away, look up their opponent's addresses in phone directories, sometimes using services that can find unlisted numbers. They also exploit online programs that trick 911 dispatchers into believing an emergency call is coming from the victim's phone or address. All the while, they conceal their own identities and locations. Authorities spent an estimated $100,000 to send more than 60 officers in April to the hoax in Long Beach, New York. Investigators said the caller was upset over losing a game of Call of Duty when he called police using Skype. SWAT officers found only a teenager wearing headphones. Swatter: Matthew Tollis of  Connecticut is accused of taking part in seven swatting calls. Tollis was allegedly part of a group that threatened to bomb the University of Connecticut, attack the home of an individual in Connecticut, create false threats to school across the country, and in one ghoulish call told police that a man with an assault rifle was headed to the new Sandy Hook Elementary School . In Bradenton, Florida, at least 15 officers showed up at the home of a professional video game player on Aug. 31 after a caller posing as his young daughter phoned in a report that he was armed and drunk. Instead, they found him playing Minecraft for a live audience over Twitch.tv, an online network with millions of viewers. 'The officers responding do not know, other than the information they're getting over the radio, exactly what is going on,' said Bradenton police Capt. William Fowler. Less than a week later, police received another bogus call routed through the man's phone that made it appear he had called in a bomb threat to a Bradenton gas station. A Connecticut man was arrested Sept. 10 on federal charges that he made swatting calls there and in at least four other states. Authorities say Matthew Tollis, 21, belonged to a group that referred to itself as TeAM Crucifix or Die. Other members live in the United Kingdom, according to the FBI, which is still trying to learn their identities. Swatting captured headlines several years ago, when a series of celebrity homes were targeted in Los Angeles. Police were so concerned about copycat crimes that they stopped releasing any public information when a hoax occurred. Officers made at least one arrest, a juvenile who targeted Justin Bieber and Ashton Kutcher. 'You can literally do it from around the world,' said Justin Cappos, assistant professor of computer science at New York University. 'It can be very challenging (to solve) depending on the sophistication of the person doing it.' Realizing the difficulty, police in Littleton, Colorado, sought help from FBI agents in Denver who are specially trained to solve cyber-crime. Grohol, the psychologist, said the prevalence of live game-streaming might be one reason for the trend. As the victim in the Colorado case, Jordan Mathewson, put it to KMGH-TV: 'They get to see all this go down right before their eyes and, you know, it's fun to them.' Intensely competitive war games that blur the lines of fantasy and reality could also contribute, said Dr. Kimberly Young, a psychologist who directs the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery in Bradford, Pennsylvania. 'They want to win at all costs, including jeopardizing someone's safety,' she said. 'Real life becomes almost meaningless because they're so entrenched and involved in these games. Swatting, to them, seems like part of the game.' A video of the Aug. 27 incident in Littleton posted on YouTube shows Mathewson playing a first-person shooter game when he hears officers approaching. 'I think we're getting swatted,' he says, raising his hands as heavily armed officers shout for him to get on the ground. He drops, and officers handcuff and frisk him. 'That's live streaming,' Mathewson tells the officers. 'I guess a joker thought it would be funny to call you guys in.'","'Swatting' has been used in the past to prank celebrities like Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher and Tom Cruise .

"A father-of-eight built an entire log cabin, complete with a window overlooking the wild frontier, in the basement of his suburban family home. Dennis Martin, 49, converted his drab basement in Helena, Alabama, into an authentic 1950s log cabin, complete with rifles in racks, a mounted deer head above the fireplace and food in vintage tins. He built his manly retreat in ten months as a way of escaping the pressures of the modern world.

Dennis Martin cleans a replica gun in the basement he converted into 1950s log cabin complete with rifles, a mounted deer head above the fireplace and food in vintage tins . Mr Martin said: 'Some of my fondest memories are hunting with my kids, hearing my grandfather's hunting stories and my yearly trip to a mountain cabin with my wife. 'I really wanted a space which captured those memories so I decided to build my own log cabin. 'I didn't have any land to build on, or the budget for a huge construction project, so I decided to build it in my basement.' The resourceful television director and occasional set builder constructed the cabin for only £65 by carefully sourcing material recycled from the 1950s.

It is made out of salvaged stonework and filled with soot, a charred log and an orange light to simulate a real fire . A fake window depicting an idyllic mountain scene to bring a touch of frontier style to the log cabin . Mr Martin, who has eight children aged three to 28 and one grandchild of three months, saved money by using salvaged wood to construct his cosy hideaway. He said: 'The free lumber came from shipping crates. I spent a week prying the wood apart and removing hundreds of nails. I used this wood for the walls, floor, gun rack shelf and table. 'To make the wood look like it was hand cut, I used a drawknife to randomly cut away the sharp edges of the boards. When I finished, the randomness created a beautiful hand-cut look.' Tins and jars with vintage labels sit on the shelves of Mr Martin's authentic 1950s cabin . Mr Martin, whose carpentry skills are self-taught, spent months ensuring his cabin looked like an authentic trappers' cabin - even down to the minutest details. He used square hand-cut nails and vintage screws from the 1950s to piece the cabin together. He printed replica labels from the 1950s for any food or cleaning products kept in the cabin. Mr Martin even included a photoshopped picture above the fireplace of what the cabin would look like from the outside if it was real. All the guns in the room are either air rifles, replicas or deactivated weapons. Mr Martin said: 'It's the details which make the room a 'total experience'. 'Occasionally I'll burn pipe tobacco in there to add to the wood, gun oil and firewood smells. 'Sometimes I'll even turn on cricket chirping sounds on my phone and stick it up on the bookshelf so it sounds like it's coming from outside. 'There's a photo album over near the window which is full of vintage deer hunting photos. 'The box by the window is full of vintage blankets and hunting clothes, and the books, magazines, ammo boxes, gun cleaning products, fishing tackle, knives and utensils are from the same era.'

"Two of Britain’s energy giants have a new claim to notoriety – their customer service is even worse than Ryanair’s. In a survey of around 3,600 consumers, Npower has ousted the controversial budget airline from the unwanted title of the worst for client care. It follows its introduction of a new billing system that left hundreds of thousands of families baffled about what they owed. Also making Ryanair look better was Scottish Power, which was ordered to pay a £750,000 penalty earlier this year for hitting customers who settle their bills with cash or cheque with unfair fees. Ryanair – which has risen from 100th to 98th in the league table compiled by consumer organisation Which? – has managed for years to annoy many of its customers with its baggage and payment fees and the combative attitude of its chief executive Michael O’Leary. Scroll down for video . Ryanair's combative CEO Micahel O'Leary, pictured, has annoyed many customers with his no-nonsense style . But Npower and Scottish Power are not alone in their sector as the other four of the ‘big six’ energy firms – British Gas, SSE, Eon and EDF – all feature in the bottom 20. Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?, said: ‘The big six energy companies have now hit rock bottom for customer service and, with record high levels of complaints, it is clear just how far they still have to go to put things right for their customers. ‘It’s disappointing that some of our biggest firms seem to have a lot to learn about keeping their customers happy. ‘This survey should be a wake-up call for the companies with the lowest customer scores.’ Npower was warned by energy regulator Ofgem earlier this year that it faces a multi-million pound fine unless it sorts out its billing system. According to Which! Npower have the worst customer service rating followed by Scottish Power . Thousands of customers were not sent bills for months, sometimes a year, despite repeated requests. The net result was they were then hit with huge bills – more than £1,000 in some cases – with demands to pay up or face enforcement action. There were also serious problems with direct debit payments. Some customers were owed hundreds of pounds by Npower as a result of over-payments, and have had difficulty getting their money back. In May, Scottish Power, which is owned by a Spanish firm, was ordered to pay £750,000 after Ofgem found it had hit thousands of customers who pay by cash and cheque with extra charges of £180 a year. The watchdog found the fees amounted to overcharging of around £100 a year. Other poor performers on customer service include TalkTalk, mobile phone operator EE, and BT. First place for service went to the telephone and internet bank First Direct, which is part of HSBC. Second went to natural cosmetics chain Lush, while in joint third place were John Lewis, Lakeland and Waitrose. Praise also went to Specsavers, Waterstones and Green Flag. Npower admitted problems but said these were being addressed. ‘We’re determined to improve and we’re already making progress,’ it said. Energy UK, which speaks for suppliers, said all the firms are well aware of the importance of customer service ‘and are working hard to improve’.","Npower and Scottish Power are worst for customer service according to list .

"A builder who looted a collection of First World War medals from the home of an elderly woman as he carried out renovation work was today branded ‘the lowest of the low’ by his victim. Gary Williams, 48, of Burnley, Lancashire, spotted the three medals through a bedroom window as he was fixing 65-year-old Jean Sanderson’s roof, then took them after asking to use the toilet. He later sold the precious items at a local pawnbrokers shop. The victim’s grandfather was a military medic who had been awarded the medals 96 years ago for serving his country in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Shocking crime: Gary Williams (left) spotted the three medals awarded to war hero Thomas Henry Lord (right) through a bedroom window as he was fixing the roof of the war hero's granddaughter's home in Burnley . The Star, British War and Allied Victory medals awarded to war hero Thomas Henry Lord were returned when the shocked pawnbroker read a public appeal about the theft and tipped off police. A solid silver flute was also stolen but not recovered. After Williams admitted burglary at Burnley Crown Court, grandmother-of-three Mrs Sanderson said: ‘What that man did was downright cruel. ‘I feel violated that he had been rummaging about - especially after I’d trusted him to do work. To think I paid him £400 and then he did this, it makes me sick. I have become quite cynical since this. ‘I would like to see him go to jail for what he has done. I want him to be punished but I fear he will get a slap on the wrist because of some personal problems he might have.’ The retired night care assistant added: ‘That won’t stop him from doing it again and that’s what bothers me, he could rob someone of a lot more. People like him are the lowest of the low. ‘I now don’t trust anyone to come to my house anymore - and that’s not fair on the honest people. Reunited: Grandmother-of-three Jean Sanderson (pictured), 65, said she felt 'violated' by the crime, which saw the theft of the Star, British War and Allied Victory medals which were awarded to her grandfather . ‘It’s sad that we live in this sort of . world. I’m sure my grandfather would have never have suspected this . sort of callous betrayal back home when he was serving his country.’ Medic: Mr Lord (right) was dispatched to the Middle East where he helped tend to the wounded on the battlefields and recover the bodies of the dead . Mr . Lord, who fought during the Mesopotamian campaign against the former . Ottoman Empire, is believed to have joined the military at the outbreak . of the First World War in 1914. He was dispatched to the Middle East where he helped tend to the wounded on the battlefields and recover the bodies of the dead. After the war he opened a fish and chip shop in Manchester with his late wife Margaret and died in 1940 aged in his 60s. All of his medals were made of solid silver and had the surname ‘Lord’ and initials ‘TH’ engraved in the back of them - and had different coloured ribbons attached. They were kept in Mrs Sanderson’s bedroom. The theft occurred between March and April after Williams turned up unannounced at Mrs Sanderson’s home and offered to do some building work. She added: ‘He did some roof work for me and fixed a gate and the back and front door. I suppose he was like a Jack of all trades - but on his van it said he was a roofer. ‘He came to me and said he noticed my back gate was falling to bits and the roof needed work. He was cold calling. I had thought it was a Good Samaritan type thing, that kind of thing. ‘He obviously knew how to work it and I suppose I was a bit or perhaps a lot naive. I thought he was doing a good thing for me and working on and off for about six weeks. ‘On a couple of occasions he said he was going to the loo and I just didn’t realise at the time that the medals had gone and I was devastated when I found out they were missing. Fought in Middle East: Mr Lord (second right, on second-from-back row), who fought during the Mesopotamian campaign against the former Ottoman Empire, is believed to have joined the military in 1914 . ‘These medals are very precious to me . and were a vital link to the family past. Thinking about what may happen . to them makes me feel sick - especially as they had been won by someone . who fought for his country. 'What that man did was downright cruel. I feel violated that he had been rummaging about - especially after I’d trusted him to do work' Jean Sanderson . ‘There . were very sentimental to me and (with the) D-Day commemorations, (I) feel sad that somebody would stoop so low as to steal war medals which . had been won for great bravery. ‘When my grandparents were alive times were very different. People would not think of stealing from you - now it seems to be happening way too much. ‘When I got them back I was absolutely over the moon but I am very paranoid now about who comes into the house and I am always checking the locks. ‘I don’t like leaving the house now. I used to go shopping, I liked to browse but now I make a list and get back as fast as I can. It has shaken me up and I feel very wary of strangers. Medals: Retired night care assistant Mrs Sanderson said she no longer trusts anyone to come to her house . ‘I live by myself and it’s made me feel uncomfortable. I hate being cynical but that’s what it has driven me to. It’s made me uncomfortable that someone can do that. ‘The man who stole his medals betrayed all those men that served in the war and sacrificed their lives to allow us all to live as we do today. I think most people appreciate the sacrifices they made. 'People like him are the lowest of the low. I now don’t trust anyone to come to my house anymore - and that’s not fair on the honest people. It’s sad that we live in this sort of world' Jean Sanderson . ‘Many like my grandson are really interested in what happened. I would dread to think what my grandfather would have thought, having served his country, for his medals to be stolen by a horrible thief decades later.’ Williams will be sentenced on November 14, after the hearing was adjourned for psychiatric reports. He was bailed on condition he does not contact Mrs Sanderson and must live at home and report to Burnley Police Station every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, between 12pm and 2pm. Judge Mr Recorder Anthony McLoughlin told him: ‘While you are being granted bail, all sentencing options remain open when you are eventually sentenced for this matter.’","Gary Williams, 48, took medals from Jean Sanderson's home in Burnley .

"Severe weather swept across Sydney on Tuesday, showering some southern suburbs in rain and hail, but it also brought some strange and surreal sky sensations with it. The beaches, city, and outer areas of Sydney were covered with bizarre bubbly looking clouds for much of the day that appeared more threatening than they actually were as the system soon moved out to sea. Called mammatus clouds - derived from the word mammary because of their round shape - these formations are most often associated with severe thunderstorms. Sydney's Bondi Beach got a makeover on Tuesday as a serious thunderstorm swept over the region . The storm brought with it strange bubbly clouds which spread across the greater Sydney area, seen here over St Mary's Cathedral in the CBD . Blue skies battled with the darkness for airspace in the inner-city suburbs . Bondi Beach got a particularly spectacular facelift as the collection of cloud pockets cast a huge shadow over the iconic stretch of sand. Just a hint of blue sky was visible at the horizon and many brave swimmers and surfers still took the plunge and went for a dip in the stormy water. In the city St Mary's Cathedral looked almost gothic against the strange sky setting as its turrets stood out against the startling scene above it. Storm clouds, known as mammatus clouds derived from the word mammary, swamped skyscrapers in the city centre . Sydney's iconic Bondi looked both spooky and spectacular under the thick blanket of clouds covering the sky . The strange scene was a little more bark that bite as the storm quickly moved out to sea . Skyscrapers in the CBD stuck out against the dark stormy sky, and earlier in the day the Bureau of Meteorology issued a storm warning for hail and damaging winds in the greater Sydney region, the Illawarra and parts of the Hunter. In other parts of Sydney strips of blue sky and sunshine were pushing through the dark blanket enveloping the city, and some even managed to catch the hint of a rainbow later in the day. The surreal clouds were captured over many part of the region, however other areas weren't so lucky and enjoyed a hail storm instead of a show. St Mary's Cathedral looked almost gothic against the strange sky setting as its turrets stood out against the startling scene above it . Some sunshine managed to peek through the clouds which blanketed the region . Picton, south west of Sydney, and Camden - in the region's west - were both hit with serious sized hailstorms but luckily the storm passed almost as quickly as it appeared. Earlier on Tuesday a number of students at a Catholic school in West Hoxton in Sydney's west were treated after it was suspected the oval they were sitting on may have been struck by lightning. The immediate threat has now passed according to the Bureau, however they are continuing to monitor the situation and have urged people to be aware of floodwater. Later in the day a rainbow was visible as the storm cleared up and took the clouds with it .","A severe weather warning was issued for the greater Sydney region on Tuesday .

"An 11-year-old girl ran away from a man in a white commercial van who attempted to abduct her from a Melbourne street. The man pulled up in the van, which had no windows, alongside the girl as she was walking along Francis St in Yarraville, an inner west Melbourne suburb, at about 3.25pm on Monday last week. Police have obtained security camera footage of a suspect van in the area soon after the September 8 incident which was being driven erratically. Detective Senior Constable Brendan O'Mahoney said the driver repeatedly asked the girl to get in the van when she became scared and ran home to alert her parents.

"Scotland's top civil servant has been accused of warning businesses to 'keep out' of the independence campaign. Sir Peter Housden is said to have urged companies not to get involved in the debate like a 'school bully', after warnings about threats to the economy if Scotland goes it alone. The row is the latest allegation of intimidation against opponents of Alex Salmond's dream of independence, with just two days until the historic referendum. Scroll down for video . Sir Peter Housden, permanent secretary for the Scottish Government, is accused of telling companies to 'keep out' of the independence debate . First Minister Alex Salmond had accused Downing Street of orchestrating a 'scaremongering' campaign by getting firms to speak out against independence . Mr Salmond has repeatedly accused the UK government and David Cameron of orchestrating 'scaremongering' stories from business leaders about the impact of independence. It followed warnings from banks, retailers, mobile phone companies and oil firms about the risk of prices rises and operations being moved south of the border. Sir Jeremy Heywood, the most senior civil servant in Downing Street, was accused of urging companies to speak out, which Number 10 denied. However, the Daily Telegraph today reported allegations that Sir Peter had told companies not to get involved in the campaign. In one case he was said to have called a business person and warned that it was 'inappropriate' to get involved, the newspaper said. A second person said Sir Peter had 'torn strips' off him after he raised questions about independence. Another director of a Scottish company claimed to have had calls from both Sir Peter, and Scottish finance minister John Swinney. The executive said: 'The conversations were always very clever and it was as though they were trying to trick me into saying something. They were saying, 'Keep out of it.' The Yes campaign has been bombarded with warnings from banks, retailers, mobile phone companies and oil firms about the risk of prices rises and operations being moved south of the border . It was claimed Sir Peter behaved like 'school bully' by trying to 'rebuke' firms about their concerns. However a spokesman for the Scottish government said 'public bodies funded by the taxpayer were properly reminded of their responsibility to remain neutral claims regarding [Sir Peter Housden] approaching other [non-public body] organisations are not true.' A spokesman for the Scottish National Party added: 'There has been plotting at senior levels of the UK Government to spread scare stories in the run-up to the referendum. 'We entirely reject these unsubstantiated accusations about individuals associated with the SNP and the Yes campaign, which appear to be an attempt to divert attention from Downing Street's campaign of bullying. 'We welcome and encourage all voices and views to the debate on Scotland's future – and no one can seriously claim that this debate is anything other than open, with many high-profile contributions from all sides.' Mr Salmond yesterday claimed the Mr Cameron's 'fingerprints are all over a scaremongering' campaign being orchestrated by Unionists. David Cameron used a speech last night to insist: 'To warn of the consequences is not to scare-monger' Dozens of major firms including BP, Asda, John Lewis, Vodafone, RBS, Lloyds and B&Q have issued warnings that independence could hit jobs and investment and put up prices. But Mr Salmond insisted the interventions by banks, telecoms companies, retailers and oil giants were being co-ordinated by Downing Street to frighten voters. Speaking during a pro-business event at Edinburgh airport, Mr Salmond said: 'When you try to pressurise people, pressurise companies, as the Prime Minister has undoubtedly been doing and indeed the Treasury, then that's a different circumstance. 'I think people in Scotland will know the Prime Minister's fingerprints are all over the scaremongering campaign and the Treasury's fingerprints are all over the bank campaign.' But Mr Cameron hit back in a speech in Aberdeen last night: 'To warn of the consequences is not to scare-monger. 'It is like warning a friend about a decision they might take that will affect the rest of their lives – and the lives of their children. 'I say all this because I don't want the people of Scotland to be sold a dream that disappears.'","Allegations that Sir Peter Housden told firms to 'keep out' of referendum .

"Falkland islanders are to hold their first ever vote on whether they want to remain British. The historic referendum – set for early next year –is intended to send a clear message to Argentina to keep its hands off. Yesterday’s announcement by the Falkland Islands Government came as . commemorative events took place to mark the 30th anniversary of their . liberation from Argentina’s military junta. Three decades after Margaret Thatcher sent 27,000 troops and more than 100 ships to repel the Argentinian invaders, Buenos Aires continues to set its sights on claiming the territory it calls Las Malvinas. Scroll down for video . Disputed territory: Falkland Islanders are to be given a vote to allow them to say whether they want to be considered as British or Argentinian . But the Falkland Islands government said it hopes a referendum will send a firm message to Argentinian president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner that islanders want to remain British. Reacting to the announcement, Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne said this is a 'truly significant moment'. The Falkland Islands, a rocky archipelago in the South Atlantic, are 7,780 miles from the UK and 1,140 miles from Buenos Aires. They have been under British control since 1833 - apart from the brief but bitter 74 days of occupation in 1982. Gavin Short, chairman of the Legislative Assembly, said: 'We are holding this referendum not because we have any doubts about who we are and what future we want, but to show the world just how certain we are about it. 'I have no doubt that the people of the Falklands wish for the islands to remain a self-governing overseas territory of the United Kingdom. The vote comes 30 years after Margaret Thatcher sent 27,000 troops and more than 100 ships to repel Argentinian invaders . 'We certainly have no desire to be ruled by the government in Buenos Aires, a fact that is immediately obvious to anyone who has visited the islands and heard our views. 'But we are aware that not everybody is able to come to these beautiful islands and to see this reality for themselves. 'And the Argentine government deploys misleading rhetoric that wrongly implies that we have no strong views or even that we are being held hostage by the UK military. This is simply absurd.' The Falkland Islands has a population of around 3,000 people, with just over half on the electoral roll and expected to take part in the vote. The referendum will be organised by the Falkland Islands government and will take place in the first half of next year. Mr Short said: 'We have thought carefully about how to convey a strong message to the outside world that expresses the views of the Falklands people in a clear, democratic and incontestable way. 'So we have decided, with the full support of the British Government, to hold a referendum on the Falkland Islands to eliminate any possible doubt about our wishes.' The Falklands government said it intends to invite international observers to verify the outcome of the referendum. It added that exact timings, the specific wording of the question and other details will be announced in the coming weeks. Argentina's Ms de Kirchner has been heating up the debate over the islands as key milestones in the 1982 conflict have passed. Last week she announced that Buenos Aires would be launching criminal proceedings against UK oil firms that are operating off the Falkland's coastline, saying they were operating illegally. Britain has accused the country of implementing a number of economic blockades on the small, isolated islands and of acting in a 'domineering way'. But British officials are adamant that there will be no change in the UK's sovereignty of the islands unless and until the Falklanders themselves wish it. Mr Browne, who arrived in the Falkland Islands yesterday, welcomed the announcement of a referendum. Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne said the referendum is a 'truly significant moment' 'Only the Falkland Islands people can determine how they wish to be governed, so I very much support this initiative by the Falkland Islands government,' he said. 'Indeed, I believe this referendum is a truly significant moment. 'It will give the Falkland Islands people the opportunity to send a clear message - not just to Argentina, but to the whole of the international community - that the islanders, and they alone, are masters of their fate.' He added that the British Government would respect whatever the outcome of the referendum might be. Islanders hope the referendum will send a clear message to Argentinian president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner that they want to remain British . 'I call on all governments who prize democracy and human rights to do likewise,' Mr Browne added. 'Whilst it is for the islanders to choose, let me be clear: the British Government greatly values the links between the UK and the Falkland Islands. 'We believe these should continue and deepen, long into the future. 'And if this proves to be the will of the Falkland Islands people, then we in the UK will not just respect it, but will continue actively to defend this act of self-determination from those who seek to challenge it.' The Government called for the referendum just two days before Ms de Kirchner is due to attend a UN committee in New York on de-colonisation. During the meeting she is expected to put the Argentinian position on the Falkland Islands. She will also be addressed by a group of young Falkland Islanders, most of whom were not born when the Falklands War took place in 1982. Speaking from London yesterday, they said they often get drowned out by the arguments over sovereignty taking place between the UK and Argentina. This will be the first referendum held on the islands, but in a poll in the mid-1980s, 94.5% of those who took part supported staying British. Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell, secretary of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Falkland Islands, said it was an 'extremely important decision' that would determine 'once and for all' the wishes of the islands' inhabitants. He said he expected a 'very similar result' to that in a referendum held by Gibraltar in 2002, in which the idea of Britain sharing sovereignty with Spain was rejected by 98.5% of residents. 'It will make it clear once and for all what the Falklands Islands want for their own destiny,' he said. 'I hope that the Argentinian government will respect the democratic wishes of the islanders.' Prime Minister David Cameron said Britain would 'respect and defend' the outcome of the referendum. 'I have always said that it is up to the Falkland Islanders themselves to choose whether they want to be British and that the world should listen to their views,' he said. 'Thirty years ago they made clear that they wanted to stay British. That's why British forces bravely liberated the island from Argentine invaders. 'Now the Argentine government wants to put that choice in doubt again, by shouting down the Islanders' ability to speak for themselves and punishing them for exercising their own free choice. 'That's why it's absolutely right that the Islanders have today set out how they intend to make their voices heard once more. And Britain will be resolute in supporting their choice. 'Next year's referendum will determine beyond doubt the views of the people of the Falklands. Britain will respect and defend their choice. 'We look to all UN members to live up to their responsibilities under the UN charter and accept the Islanders' decision about how they want to live.'","Island government hopes to send message to Argentina that they want to remain British .

"Democrats serving on a House committee tasked with investigating the  attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya said today that key questions about the September 11, 2012 assault had already been 'asked and answered' and the committee was at risk of 'wasting taxpayers' dollars.' They also argued that four months after it's creation, the committee, which was allotted $3.3 million in funding for 2014, has still yet to put forth clear objectives and a timeline to complete its investigation. 'If we do not define the scope of the committee's work in advance, this committee may end up being a committee in search of a mission, taking, on a life of it's own and costing taxpayers millions,' Rep. Adam Schiff, a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee argued. Scroll down for video . Rep. Elijah Cummings, center, said today during a press conference held by Democratic members of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, that the committee was at risk of 'wasting taxpayers' dollars.' To Cummings' left are Reps. Adam Smith and Linda Sanchez. To his right are Reps. Adam Schiff and Rep. Tammy Duckworth . The House Select Committee on Benghazi, whose formation was announced in early May by House Speaker John Boehner, will hold it's first public hearing tomorrow morning. Ahead of the hearing, the committee's five Democrats released a 133-page Compendium of Investigative Resources and a Benghazi on the Record online database that lists frequently asked questions about the Benghazi attack, including, 'Where was the president and what did he do on the night of the attacks?' Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on both the Benghazi committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform committee, said Tuesday that Democrats sifted through previous reports and hearings to create the database, and they hoped that their Republican colleagues would use it as a a research tool. 'In this time of austerity, we don't want to be wasting taxpayers' dollars,' Cummings said, after the government has already conducted numerous reviews of the events that occurred leading up to and during the attack. 'We need to make full use of the extensive investigations that have come before us already,' he said. 'We need to avoid duplication, conserve taxpayer dollars, and help improve the security of US facilities and personnel around the world.' Already, seven congressional committees have held investigations into Benghazi and they have released nine reports, the Democrats said. 'We should not be spending the time that we have on this committee reviewing questions that have already been answered in numerous investigations and reports,' Rep. Tammy Duckworth, a freshman Democrat on the committee, said today. 'If we want to make sure that no American diplomat, no American life, no american service member is ever put in the same kind of jeopardy again,' she continued, 'then we need to move beyond the questions that have already be answered.' Tomorrow's Benghazi committee hearing will supposedly do just that. The topic of the hearing is whether the State Department has implemented the 29 changes in policy recommended in an Accountability Review Board report released several months after the Benghazi attack. The ARB encouraged State to increase the number of U.S. forces at embassies in high-threat areas and rely less on local law enforcement for the protection of American personnel after it's investigation into the Benghazi assault found that 'systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department' were responsible for security that was 'inadequate' for the consulate in Benghazi. 'If we do not define the scope of the committee's work in advance, this committee may end up being a committee in search of a mission, taking, on a life of it's own and costing taxpayers millions,' Rep. Adam Schiff argued . House Republicans have criticized the Accountability Review Board in the past for failing to interview then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for its investigation, as well as two deputy secretaries of state. A news report released on Monday from The Daily Signal, an outlet ran by conservative think-tank The Heritage Foundation, claimed that ARB's investigation was further flawed because it did not have access to all of the documents relevant to it's inquires. Raymond Maxwell, a former deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, claims he stumbled upon State Department employees, including one of his subordinates, hiding information that could be damaging to Clinton or her allies. 'She told me, ""Ray, we are to go through these stacks and pull out anything that might put anybody in the [Near Eastern Affairs] front office or the seventh floor in a bad light"",' Maxwell's employee allegedly told him. Maxwell told The Daily Signal that those documents were set aside and put in basement room to be reviewed by Clinton's staff. Only the least damaging documents were provided to the ARB, he claimed. A State Department spokesman said on Monday that Maxwell's accusations were 'totally without merit.' Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican on the House's Benghazi committee, told The Daily Signal that the committee would investigate the charge nonetheless. 'I'm 100 percent confident the Benghazi Select Committee is going to dive deep on that issue,' he said. Cummings scoffed at the allegations on Tuesday, saying that when Maxwell was interviewed by Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa 'he never talked about this.' 'He had plenty of opportunities to do it, he didn't,' Cummings claimed, noting that the committee questioned him 'extensively.' 'But keep in mind we have allegations seem to come out every week,' he said, others of which have turned out to be erroneous.","The House's Select Committee on Benghazi has a $3.3 million budget for this year .

The . research grant has been awarded to a trio of university researchers . from the University of Pittsburgh’s Swanson School of Engineering, . Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the University . of Illinois. 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process that works in a similar way to a laser printer, by . building a solid object from a series of layers with each one printed . directly on top of the previous one. 4D printing takes 3D printing one step further by allowing 3D-printed . materials to be programmed to self-assemble into different shapes over . time.

Co-investigator . Jennifer Lewis added that current 3D printing technology allows the . researchers to build in complicated functionality—not just throughout an . entire structure, but also within specific areas of the structure. ‘If . you use materials that possess the ability to change their properties . or shape multiple times, you don’t have to build for a specific, . one-time use,’ she explained. The . research will use responsive fillers embedded within a hydrogel. They . claim this will open up new routes for producing the next generation of . smart sensors, coatings, textiles, and structural components. 4D printing takes 3D printing one step further by allowing 3D-printed materials to be programmed to self-assemble into different shapes over time . ‘The . ability to create one fabric that responds to light by changing its . colour, and to temperature by altering its permeability, and even to an . external force by hardening its structure, becomes possible through the . creation of responsive materials that are simultaneously adaptive, . flexible, lightweight, and strong,’ said Harvard University’s Ralph .

"A well-respected physical education teacher from Virginia landed behind bars for allegedly trying his hand at styling hair on an unsuspecting friend. Melvin Hunt, 61, a gym teacher at the private Riverside School in Chesterfield County, has been charged with misdemeanor assault in connection to the bizarre incident. The victim, a 44-year-old psychical education and health teacher from Elizabeth Davis Middle School, told police that Hunt chopped off 8 to 12 inches of hair on the right side of her head while hugging her in a school parking last week. Melvin Scissorhands: Physical education teacher Melvin Hunt, 61, has been charged with misdemeanor assault for allegedly cutting 8-12 inches of hair from a friend's head while hugging her . According to a police report obtained by Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Riverside School employee arrived at his friend’s place of work at around 3.30pm Friday to set out on a planned trip. While sitting in his car, Hunt informed the teacher that he no longer needed her to go with him. He then asked for the keys to the woman's car so he could place a letter inside for her to read later. The 44-year-old middle school gym teacher handed him the keys, and Hunt went over to the vehicle to put the note on the passenger seat. The court document states that when he returned to his car, he asked the woman for a hug. According to the complaint, as the couple embraced, Hunt firmly grasped the woman's ponytail and cut several inches of hair. She only realized what happened after she saw her chopped tresses fall to the ground. Educator: Hunt has been teaching physical education at Riverside School in Virginia for many years . The 61-year-old suspect then tossed his friend’s car keys over a fence and took off in his car, according to investigators. Police said Hunt and the women know each other but have not been dating, but in her request for an emergency order of protection the 44-year-old listed her relationship to Hunt as ‘girlfriend.’ Mr Hunt showed up for work Monday morning after his release from jail, but he has since been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. In 2007, the veteran gym teacher won the Virginia Middle School Physical Education Teacher of the Year.","Melvin Hunt, 61, charged with misdemeanor assault over the unsolicited haircut .

"If Scotland votes ‘Yes’ on Thursday Alex Salmond will go down in history as the man who led his country to independence – or needlessly tore apart the world’s most successful union after 300 years. But Mr Salmond will not have achieved the Scottish nationalists’ dream alone. Throughout his political life the SNP’s great hope has surrounded himself with a close-knit team of advisers which have run the party with ruthless efficiency. The spinners, backroom deal makers and millionaire backers have sacrificed everything for ‘the Cause’ - propelling Scotland to the brink of independence. Scroll down for video . Spin chief Kevin Pringle (left) is Alex Salmond's most-trusted lieutenant in the SNP inner circle dragging Scotland towards independence . Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon with her husband Peter Murrell - the chief executive of the SNP - following their wedding service at the Oran Mor in Glasgow in 2010 . Kevin Pringle, Mr Salmond's Alastair Campbell-style spin chief, is the main power behind the throne. But Mr Salmond also relies on the SNP chief executive Peter Murrell – husband of Scotland’s deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Together the four party chieftains have guided the party from multiple election defeats to the brink of breaking up the United Kingdom. The SNP's success was built on picking a team of backroom supporters united by two goals: winning elections and taking Scotland out of the Union. This is the backroom army which really runs the SNP. At the heart of the operation is Mr Pringle. Now in his forties, he joined the party in 1989 and swiftly rose to a position where he was the First Minister's most trusted lieutenant. Born in Perth, the son of a milkman and an auxiliary nurse, he started worrying about nuclear weapons at the age of 11, joined the SNP at the age of 18 and began working for the party as a researcher at 21 as soon as he graduated from Aberdeen University. He became director of communications in the decade that followed, leading up to the creation of the Scottish parliament. In 1998, a year after Scots voted in the devolution referendum, Miss Sturgeon said Mr Pringle was the SNP's ‘biggest asset'. When Mr Salmond stood down from Holyrood in 2000 to lead the SNP group in the Commons, leaving John Swinney to hold the reins in Edinburgh, Mr Pringle followed him to London. Colin Weir (left) and his wife Chris pose for pictures with champagne during a photocall in Falkirk, Scotland, after scooping the lottery in 2011 . The SNP supporters won £161million and have donated £4.5million of their fortune to the campaign to break up the Union . Stephen Noon . A senior policy adviser who wrote the SNP's 2011 manifesto and is now chief strategist at Yes Scotland. A Jesuit-educated former Young Conservative, he was spotted by Mr Salmond after he and two fellow Edinburgh University students draped the Lion Rampant over the railings in front of the Coronation Chair at Westminster Abbey. He later made the headlines when he claimed he was sacked as press secretary to the head of the Catholic Church in England for being gay. Noel Dolan . The former TV journalist has been with the party since 1999 before being appointed Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's top adviser in 2007 - a position he keeps to this day. He is undoubtedly one of the most popular spin doctors in Holyrood. Colin McAllister . The spin doctor headed the SNP's communications team when Mr Pringle went to London, is now a special adviser. In the corridors of power in Holyrood he is seen as ‘harder to like’ than Mr Dolan. Geoff Aberdein . A skilled amateur footballer with Edinburgh-based club Spartans, was only 24 when he joined Mr Salmond's operation and became known in the parliament as the First Minister's 'bag carrier'. He had worked part-time in the SNP leader's constituency office and was so dedicated to the cause of Nationalism that he turned down a job with the New York Times to remain with the party. In the years since 2007, Mr Aberdein's role has increased massively and he now has the grand, West Wing-style title of chief of staff. Insiders say he is almost as powerful as Mr Pringle once was. Stuart Nicolson . A former Scottish political editor at the Scottish Daily Mail, who has drastically cut the amount of time advisers spend with the media. Observers agree that he has become increasingly 'tetchy' in recent months and the entire communications team often shows disdain for a printed press that has repeatedly exposed the shortcomings of the independence campaign. Liz Lloyd . A Geordie who was once named one of Scotland's most eligible women and is one of the loudest defenders of the economics behind independence. Mr Pringle stood for the SNP in Edinburgh Central in the 2003 Holyrood election. He came third and was accused of 'anti-Englishness' after calling for the Duke of Wellington's statue in Princes Street to be removed to make way for one of Robert Burns. After a brief stint in the communications department at Scottish Gas, Mr Pringle returned to take control of Mr Salmond's spin team in the 2007 Scottish elections. Mr Pringle is now based in the party’s tiny HQ on Jackson's Entry, a small alley between Edinburgh's Royal Mile and Holyrood Road. This is the base for another passionate Nationalist who had settled on a political career behind the scenes: Mr Murrell, who had once been Mr Salmond's constituency assistant. Since 2001, when he replaced Mike Russell as chief executive, he has managed to make himself so invaluable that his remuneration package has soared from £35,000 to more than £100,000. Few people claim to know him well. He is rarely seen, except at elections and at party conferences. At these carefully choreographed conferences, he is nearly always present in the main auditorium, usually standing in the shadows to the side of the stage. He whispers instructions to Cabinet ministers as they prepare to make keynote speeches and is more powerful than anyone watching Mr Salmond's tub-thumping performances on the TV could possibly realise. Only after Miss Sturgeon's speech, when he kisses his wife, does he appear in the spotlight. Supporters credit him with creating one of Europe's most formidable election machines. But critics will never forgive him for ignoring warnings that one SNP candidate in 2011, Bill Walker, was a serial wifebeater. Walker was eventually sent to jail when his past caught up with him, while Mr Murrell survived calls for his resignation. The chief executive has worked closely with Mr Pringle over the years, and the pair were present at a crucial summit at the Craigellachie Hotel on Speyside in 2005. There they made a solemn vow 'to be ready for government before May 3, 2007, and in government thereafter.' But the SNP's operation is not a two-man team. Mr Salmond has also received crucial backing from long time SNP supporters Chris and Colin Weir – who happened to win the lottery in 2011. The pair have bankrolled an astonishing 80 per cent of Yes Scotland’s fight to break up Britain, donating £2.5million to the cause in just 12 months. It shows that the Ayrshire couple, who won £161m in a Euromillions draw in 2011, has donated a total of £4.5m to SNP and the Yes campaign since their win. It means almost 80 per cent of £4.9million funding for the separation campaign has come from just one source – something the grassroots campaign Unlock Democracy warned was ‘unhealthy’. The Weirs’ latest £2.5million pledge to Yes Scotland is their second to the pro-independence campaign, having previously donated £1million. And the couple, who scooped Scotland’s biggest ever lottery jackpot, also gave £1million to the SNP, in 2011.","First Minister supported by team of spinners and backroom dealers .

"An alarming number of Australians are excusing the actions of rapists or domestic violence offenders by shifting the blame on the victim, a new survey reveals. A nationwide survey of 17,500 people recorded their attitudes towards violence against women, where one in five people believe that if the victim is under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, then she is partially at fault for rape. The VicHealth report also found that 40 per cent of those who were surveyed thought many women who said they had been raped had given the man the wrong impression by leading him on and later had regrets, the Herald Sun reports. Scroll down for video . A new nationwide survey by VicHealth found one in five people believe the victim is to blame if she's drunk or drug affected . There's also an increase of viewpoints justifying rape and domestic violence . Among those surveyed, 16 per cent believed that women who were raped who said 'no' often mean to say 'yes'. The National Community Attitudes Survey also found disturbing views that justify rape and violence are on the rise. Compared to last year's figures, the number increased from four to 10 for those who thought rape occurred because men could not control their need for sex. Almost a quarter of Australians believed domestic violence is excusable if the attacker is unable to control their anger or regrets the act. VicHealth chief executive Jerril Rechter told the Herald Sun she had concerns over the number of people who defended such acts and were also under the impression women were part of the issue. 'A culture that excuses rape and violence is one that allows it to happen,' she said. 'Violence is a choice, not an instinct and it is never excusable.' Earlier this month a nationwide Our Watch campaign was launched as part of the foundation's strategy to prevent domestic violence in 20 years. The initiative, to stop violence against women and children through community and school programs, revealed that one woman is killed almost every week by a current or former partner in Australia.","A new nationwide survey by VicHealth found one in five people believe the victim is to blame if she's drunk or drug affected .

"Big collection: Bill Cosby and his wife Camille will open up their collection of African-American art to the public as part of the Smithsonian exhibit . Bill Cosby and his wife Camille plan to showcase their private collection of African-American art that they have amassed over a period of four decades for the first time in an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art in Washington DC announced on Monday that the entire Cosby collection will go on view in November in a unique exhibit juxtaposing African-American art with African art. The collection, which will be loaned to the museum, includes works by leading African-American artists such as Beauford Delaney, Faith Ringgold, Jacob Lawrence, Augusta Savage and Henry Ossawa Tanner. The Cosby collection of more than 300 African-American paintings, prints, sculptures and drawings has never been loaned or seen publicly, except for one work of art. 'It's so important to show art by African-American artists in this exhibition,' Cosby said in a written statement. 'To me, it's a way for people to see what exists and to give voice to many of these artists who were silenced for so long, some of whom will speak no more.' Cosby, 77, a comedian, actor and author is best known for the smash hit TV show he crafted, 'The Cosby Show,' which aired on NBC from 1984 to 1992. The show broke ground by featuring the Huxtables, a successful black family. He later starred in a CBS sitcom and is now in talks with NBC for a new extended-family sitcom with Cosby as the patriarch. The new project could air as early as next year. The exhibit 'Conversations: African and African-American Artworks in Dialogue' will open on Nov. 9 and will be on view through early 2016 in Washington. It will be organized by themes, placing pieces from African artists in the Smithsonian collection near similar works from African-American artists in Cosby's collection. Curators said it will explore ideas about history, creativity, power, identity and artistry. Highlight: This is an oil on canvas work by Henry Ossawa Tanner, titled The Thankful Poor. The entire collection will go on public view in November . Artistry: This oil on canvas work by Gerard Sekoto, titled Boy and the Candle, is part of the Cosby collection and the public will be able to see it in the flesh in November . Some highlights include rare 18th and early 19th-century portraits by Baltimore-based artist Joshua Johnston, explorations of black spirituality in the 1894 piece ""The Thankful Poor"" by Henry Ossawa Tanner and Cosby family quilts. 'The exhibition will encourage all of us to draw from the creativity that is Africa, to recognize the shared history that inextricably links Africa and the African diaspora and to seek the common threads that weave our stories together,' said Museum Director Johnnetta Betsch Cole, in announcing the exhibit. The exhibition of Cosby's collection is part of the African art museum's 50th anniversary.

"Anyone who’s ever been stuck on a train must have thought this at least once: maybe it would be quicker on foot. James Heptonstall did more than just wonder – he got up and ran like the clappers. In a daredevil challenge of man versus machine, the 30-year-old England touch-rugby player burst out through the train’s open doors, sprinted fearlessly up flights of steps and belted through city streets in an attempt to beat it to the next stop. Scroll down for video . Ready, set, go! As soon as the doors open, Mr Heptonstall is captured charging out of the doors (left) by his friend Noel Carroll. Footage from the GoPro camera on his head shows him running up the station's stairs . The race is on: GoPro footage shows Mr Heptonstall running through the streets towards Cannon Street Tube station, where he makes it to the carriage (pictured right) just moments before the doors close . Somewhere beneath him, the London Underground train he had just abandoned at Mansion House had already begun to clatter and trundle its way eastwards on the Circle Line, unhindered, and running perfectly on schedule. Had this been a Superman movie, our hero would have been billed as ‘Faster than a speeding train…’ Mr Heptonstall, however, had yet to cross the finish line. But what’s this? Above ground at Cannon Street, a panting young environmental consultant from Hampstead, dressed in shorts and running gear, comes skidding through the ticket barrier at high speed. He swipes his Oyster Card to get through. He leaps down the steps so fast he almost tumbles into the wall. In the carriage he vacated one stop earlier, all eyes are now on the platform entrance as the train doors are about to close. Waiting: Mr Heptonstall is seen standing behind closed doors as the tube carriage leaves Blackfriars station . First obstacle: Footage taken  on a GoPro camera shows him rushing through the first set of ticket barriers . Leaving the station: Before he bounds up the stairs that lead from Mansion House station to the street . Sprint: A map shows the route Mr Heptonstall took between Mansion House and Cannon Street stations . And then he appears! With a dramatic, triumphant lunge, he hurls himself back into the carriage – cheered and applauded by the same passengers who had watched him depart. Mission accomplished… with less than two seconds to spare. Now his Race The Tube video, filmed on a miniature camera strapped to his head, is becoming a favourite on YouTube and a talking point among weary Underground travellers across the network. Mr Heptonstall completed the 415-yard, platform to platform sprint in 1min 18secs. He clocked up an average speed approaching 11mph, on a route that included having to negotiate two ticket barriers and scale or descend 75 steps. The train took 1min 20secs to travel along 339 yards of track, timed from the moment its doors closed at Mansion House and opened at Cannon Street. Footage inside the carriage was taken on a second camera operated by his friend Noel Carroll. Video from Epic Challenges . On the street: Another friend films Mr Heptonstall as he sprints between the two stations in the City of London . Clock is ticking: Mr Heptonstall races down one street before setting his sights on the Tube station . Last leg: With the station just feet in front of him, Mr Heptonstall keeps up the pace as he continues the sprint . Destination: Video taken by a camera attached to Mr Heptonstall's head shows him running into Cannon Street . ‘At first the other people on the train didn’t really know what was going on,’ he said. ‘I did get a few suspicious looks, although to be fair, I was wearing sportswear with a camera strapped to my head. I belted out as soon as the doors opened and Noel explained to the carriage what we were trying to achieve. After that, they were all waiting on tenterhooks.’ His spectacular re-entry to the carriage provoked delight and admiration – and secured a dozen or so impartial witnesses to verify his feat, should he ever need them. Mr Heptonstall was inspired to tackle the ultimately pointless challenge by others who had completed similar quests on European transport networks. He often uses the Tube to get to work but confesses he is not a huge fan. ‘Sometimes I just run,’ he said. Final push: Tension mounts after Mr Heptonstall enters Cannon Street Tube station and leaps down the stairs . Anxious: Passengers inside the carriage can be seen waiting for Mr Heptonstall to reappear at Cannon Street . Desperate: Film taken from Mr Heptonstall's camera shows his view of the waiting carriage as he runs .

"Lynne Hansen, 58, did not sleep well last night. She was disturbed by the deadly crash that yesterday claimed the life of Aneri Patel, 16, at the exact same spot where her daughter, Emma, 20, was killed by a car seven years ago. The similarities were 'eerie'. Both young women were hit by inexperienced drivers near the bus stop on the corner of Railway Parade in Kogarah, in Sydney's south, around the same time of the morning. Mrs Hansen's first reaction to Monday's horrible news was to feel sorrow for Ms Patel's mother and father. '(I was thinking about) the poor parents, really, because we're the ones that live with it,' Mrs Hansen told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday. 'The other drivers, they go home eventually, they grow up,' she said. But for the parents, 'it's horrible, you never get over it.' Scroll down for video . Tragedy: In March 2007 pedestrian Emma Hanson, 20, was struck by a car at the exact same intersection where Aneri Patel, 16 was killed on Monday . CCTV footage showed the moment Emma and other bystanders were struck. Learner driver Rose Deng was behind the wheel of this red Toyota Echo which ploughed into pedestrians in Kogarah in March 2007. Aneri Patel, a 16-year-old student at Kogarah High School, was killed when she was struck by a 4WD driven by an unlicensed 26-year-old driver on Monday morning. Police arrested Puipuimaota Galuvao, 26, who was driving the car that struck and killed Ms Patel. It's believed the car mounted a footpath and hit the student outside a Kogarah chemist on Monday morning. Galuvao is the sister of former NRL star Joe Galuvao, a two-time premiership winner for Many Sea Eagles and Penrith Panthers. She has been charged with a number of driving offences including dangerous driving occasioning death and driving without a licence. She has been granted bail and will appear in Kogarah Local Court on October 14. Friends gather where Aneri Patel was killed yesterday, singing songs and lighting candles. The crash site in Kogarah yesterday. The scene in Kogarah on Monday. Two others were severely injured by the crash. An unlicensed driver was behind the wheel of the 4WD that killed the Kogarah High student and severely injured two others, a 51-year-old woman and an 84-year-old man, about 11:30am yesterday. The driver, a 26-year-old woman, was granted bail. According to Nine News, the sister of former NRL star Joe Galuvao was charged over the crash. Ms Hansen was killed in March 2007 when learner driver Rose Deng accidentally drove a red Toyota Echo into a waiting bus queue. No changes have been made to the intersection since the incident. The speed limit on Railway Parade was reduced from 60km/h to 50km/h. Kogarah mayor Stephen Agius told Daily Mail Australia that NSW police, Roads and Maritimes Services, police and council agreed  'no feasible engineering solutions would have prevented that (2007) crash occuring'. Mrs Hansen, whose family is from Orange, said bollards should be installed as a safety measure at the 'very tricky' intersection where both Emma and Aneri were hit. 'It is a tricky intersection. I think anyone who has driven there would agree with me,' Mrs Hansen said. 'You've really got to stop and think at that intersection.' She said inexperienced drivers would 'definitely' struggle with the intersection. Mum Lynne Hansen said the similarities between the crashes were 'eerie'. Pictured: Emma Hansen. Kogarah Chamber of Commerce president Megan Barker told Daily Mail Australia bollards should be put up to protect pedestrians. 'We definitely need some bollards there to protect pedestrians,' she said. 'We just need those lights looked at and the bus stop... moved down the road. 'It's right on the bend. It's in a bit of a bad spot, there, actually.' Mr Agius said Kogarah Council will act immediately should police and RMS investigations into Monday's accident make any recommendations. The driver who allegedly struck Ms Patel with a 4WD will face offences including dangerous driving occasioning death, negligent driving occasioning death, and driving a vehicle on the road without a licence. She will face Kogarah Local Court on October 14. Mrs Hansen said Emma was 'the most gorgeous girl, inside and out' who was loved by all'. She had been studying fashion design at Kogarah TAFE around the time of her death. Mrs Hansen said she had forgiven the driver, Ms Deng, for the accident which killed her daughter. But she still thinks about Emma everyday. 'I just feel so sorry for the (Aneri's) parents because you never get over it,' Mrs Hansen said. 'Really, you just look at what your child was like.. and how much you're going to miss your child and love them. Emma Hansen was a studying to become telephone counsellor to help people in need. Lifeline's Sutherland office set up a scholarship fund in her name - the Emma Hansen Memorial Fund - for people who want to study Telephone Counselling but cannot afford it.

"A grandfather has shot dead a lawyer and seriously wounded the father of his three-year-old grandchild during a custody battle in a Danish courtroom. The 67-year-old gunman, who has not been named, opened fire in the court in Copenhagen before being arrested nearby. A Danish tabloid newspaper posted a photo on its website showing a police officer aiming a weapon at a person on his knees, saying it showed the suspect being arrested . After the shooting, police sealed off the Town Hall Square in Raadhuspladsen in Copenhagen, where the court is situated . The gunman opened fire in the courtroom killing a 57-year-old lawyer and seriously wounding another man, the father of the gunman's three-year-old grandchild . Police and court officials confirmed that the victims were a 57-year-old lawyer and his client, a 31-year-old man who was in a custody dispute with the gunman's daughter. It is thought the shooting happened in the bailiff's court, which is part of the city court and when the gunman was apprehended, police seized a rifle used in the shooting. According to Ekstra Bladet, the 67-year-old entered the courtroom at 10 am this morning, with a sawn-off rifle, which he had hidden in a bag. Shortly after he fired a total of six shots, some in the courtroom and others in the hallway outside. Initial reports suggested one of the vicitms was shot inide the building and another outside, but officials later said they were both shot inside the court.

"Ex-postman David Livesey has been given a suspended sentence for stealing promotional meerkat toys intended for insurance customers . A postman stole dozens of meerkat toys destined for Comparethemarket.com customers and made hundreds of pounds selling them to collectors on eBay. David Livesey, 61, made almost £1,500 in the scam, which at first appeared 'simples', the catchphrase of Aleksandr the Meerkat in the now-famous British TV adverts. He helped himself to parcels which he recognised contained the collectors toys, which are handed out to customers of the insurance website. But Livesey's cash-making scheme was brought to an end after Royal Mail investigators discovered that 78 of the highly-prized toys had gone missing. They put an electronic tracking device in one of the meerkat parcels, which was later recovered after Livesey failed to deliver it. Inquiries revealed he had sold the toys for between £5 and £43 a time - and he mailed them out to his eBay buyers with used postage stamps. The 61-year-old, from Barnoldswick, Lancashire, also took several DVDs dispatched by Amazon during his two-year stealing spree. Livesey, now jobless and living on benefits, admitted he was a thief when challenged by his bosses. He admitted three counts of theft, which involved stealing a quantity of postal packets containing meerkats, stealing other postal packets between 2011 and 2014, and stealing the final packet on February 6 this year. Appearing at Burnley Crown Court, he also pleaded guilty to having in his possession used postage stamps for use in connection with fraud. He received six months in prison, suspended for a year, with a three month night-time curfew. He was also ordered to pay a £80 victim surcharge. Gerard Doran, prosecuting for the Royal Mail, told the hearing Livesey had been employed by the Royal Mail for nearly 13 years, having started in 2001. It was estimated he had stolen 78 meerkat toys and made a £1,430 profit by selling them through his eBay account. The toys were only available when insurance was bought or renewed through a company which advertised on Comparethemarket.com. Mr Doran said investigators conducted surveillance and two meerkat toys were introduced into the mail due to be sorted by Livesey. Aleksandr Orlov, the meerkat from the Compare The Market adverts, has become a cult character . Electronic tracking devices were placed in the packages and Livesey was watched while carrying out his round. When challenged, he agreed to be searched and the tagged package was later found in his van. When his home was searched, 31 used stamps and some DVDs were found. Eight boxes of meerkat postal packages with the address labels torn off were also discovered. Mr Doran said Livesey denied he had stolen all the recovered items from the post.

He admitted he had been stealing meerkat toys and selling them over the internet for over two years. He said he had the used stamps to dispatch goods sold on eBay.

'He recently had a significant operation for liver cancer, his wound had become infected and he had been readmitted to hospital on Saturday. 'His financial circumstances are quite bleak. He has remained out of work since these offences.' Sentencing, the judge Mr Recorder Anthony McLoughlin told Livesey he had been an experienced postal worker and had committed a breach of trust. He said meerkat toys had some 'cult interest' to people seeking to acquire them and added: 'You had some financial difficulties. That only explains it. It doesn't excuse what you were about. It went on for over two years.' He added: 'You have actually ruined the last 45 years of your working life by being found out for these offences. 'You have demonstrated genuine remorse rather than self pity for the circumstances you find yourself in.'","Postman took toys intended for insurance customers from the mail .

"They're every girl's secret slimming saviour - just ask fans Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey and Princess Beatrice. But, as Renée Zellweger proved in the hilarious bedroom scene with Hugh Grant in 2001 film Bridget Jones, Spanx, whilst super slimming, aren't the sexiest undergarment. Until now. The folks at Spanx have finally unveiled shapewear that aims to trim figures and still look good in the bedroom. Slimming and sexy? Spanx, who are famed for their figure trimming underwear, have unveiled a new £82 lace teddy, which they say is slimming and sexy - a far cry from their more traditional shapewear . Named the Lust Have collection, the company say they've combined the most sought-after trends of the season  with their famous slimming technology to create a 'luxurious lace slimming teddy'. Available in black and cream, the teddy comes with adjustable straps and un-structured cups to fit any bust size, whilst the poppered gusset gives a practical side to the teddy, say the makers.

Her secret weapon: Singer Adele even revealed that she wore Spanx under her dazzling black gown at the 2012 Grammy Awards . The undergarment, which can be worn without a bra, has also been designed with a cotton gusset with snaps for when nature calls and added back ruching aims to conceal any back fat. However, looking good doesn't come cheap - the teddy, which is available online and at Harrods, will set you back £82. Previously a red carpet secret, Spanx are now proudly worn by A-listers such as Kim and Kourtney Kardashian, Princess Beatrice, Jessica Alba and Beyonce.

'Apparently Freshpet food is the best food than ordinary dog food [sic],' he says. 'He wants to eat it every night, every day. Apparently now that's good food!' At one point in the commercial, which appears to be largely unscripted, the little boy tells viewers to call him - before giving out his telephone number. 'Just call the Apparently Kid when you see this commercial,' he says. 'Bye and apparently!'

'Well, it was great because apparently you're spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy, that's all you do is get dizzy,' he said. 'I've never ever been on live television.'

'I don't know what it means, but I use it in, ""Wow, this is apparently annoying"".'

"A pledge by David Cameron to maintain Scotland’s controversial public spending formula was yesterday branded by Conservative MPs as a ‘last-minute bribe’. Senior Tories warned the Prime Minister faces a ‘deferred bloodbath’ over the inducements offered to the Scots to persuade them to stay in the UK. Yesterday, Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg signed up to a ‘vow’ to the people of Scotland, including a guarantee to continue the Barnett allocation – which sees the Scots get more than £1,300 per head in public spending above the UK average. Scroll down for video . Vow: The promise to Scotland's voters was delivered on the front page of the left-wing Daily Record newspaper . But even Lord Barnett, who devised the formula in 1979, said last night that it was ‘grossly unfair’ and should be scrapped. The party leaders said the UK ‘exists to ensure opportunity and security for all by sharing our resources equitably across all four nations’. Mr Cameron used to argue that the formula was ‘coming to the end of its life’, but retreated from that position last year after talks with Mr Salmond. The Barnett formula was devised as a way of adjusting block grants to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to spend on devolved policy areas, based on population. Nationalists insist there are good reasons why Scotland receives more spending per head than the UK average, such as the difficulty of providing services in remote areas. But Lord Barnett said it was ‘a subterfuge of a formula’. Asked in an interview with Radio 4’s The World Tonight if he thought it should be axed altogether, the 91-year-old Labour peer said: ‘I do now.’ He said he would call a debate in the Lords next month and try to force a vote on the issue. Lord Barnett added that he had intended the formula to be used for a year or two, but it has now been 35 years. Unrest is already mounting at Westminster over the leaders’ pledge to agree an ‘extensive’ package of new powers for Edinburgh, including control of tax and welfare, within six weeks after a No vote. The boss of one of the biggest pollsters last night admitted that his industry may have got the referendum result completely wrong. Martin Boon, director of ICM, said the vote could be a ‘polling Waterloo’ if companies fail to predict the outcome. Recent forecasts suggest the result is on a knife edge. But Mr Boon said there was a ‘real danger’ to polling accuracy as data may have been corrupted. Results could be skewed by a surge in Yes votes among people who do not normally vote, because they are often below the radar of pollsters. On the other hand, ‘shy No’ supporters afraid of being accused of lacking patriotism may decline to tell surveyors how they plan to vote, he added. The situation recalls memories of the 1992 election, when polling firms predicted a knife-edge victory for Neil Kinnock – but John Major won by a slim overall majority. Mr Boon told BBC Radio 4 that the actual referendum result could see a much more comfortable victory for either side. ‘I think and hope that the best that we in the industry can hope for is that we dodge a bullet,’ he said. There is particular anger that Gordon Brown appears to be dictating the terms of commitments from the three parties. Mr Cameron has ruled out an English parliament, but said the need to rein in the right of Scottish MPs to vote on matters no longer affecting their constituents – the so-called West Lothian Question – was becoming ‘pressing’. Today’s Survation poll for the Daily Mail finds that even Scots believe the present system is unfair and that their MPs’ influence should be reduced as Holyrood becomes more powerful. It finds that, in the event of more powers being devolved to the Scottish Parliament, 58 per cent of Scots think their MPs should not still be able to vote on laws which only affect the rest of the UK – with just 21 per cent backing the status quo. There are growing demands from Tory MPs for a ‘grand committee’ of English MPs at Westminster, which would determine English-only affairs. ‘What price the union?’ said one senior Conservative MP angered by the last-ditch offers to the Scots. ‘And why is Gordon Brown the tail-wagging Westminster dog? ‘Nobody wants to cause trouble ahead of the referendum but these panicked offers mean Alex Salmond has won whatever the result.’ Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘I don’t see why people in the East Midlands should be worse off to the tune of thousands of pounds than the people of Scotland … we’ve always thought it was unfair, but now … it has to be dealt with. You can’t just give powers to Scotland without a fairer distribution of funding and solving the West Lothian Question.’ Former minister Christopher Chope added: ‘I can’t understand how they think they can deliver this without Parliament looking at the whole picture.This smacks of a last-minute bribe. The party leaders don’t have the authority to make a bribe on behalf of the people of the United Kingdom. ‘Taxation is an issue for Parliament … We don’t legislate by presidential-style decree.’ One Tory MP angered by the last-ditch offers asked: 'Why is Gordon Brown the tail-wagging Westminster dog?' 'These panicked offers mean Alex Salmond has won whatever the result,’ said one angry Tory MP . Gordon Brown last night attempted to rule out curbing the rights of Scottish MPs as part of a post-referendum deal. The former prime minister told Channel 4 News he does not think you can have ‘two classes of MPs at Westminster’. John Redwood, a former Cabinet minister, said: ‘If Scotland is going to decide some tax rates as well as spending for itself, so should England.’ JAMES SLACK'S ANALYSIS: The last-minute bribes being offered to stay in the UK . The ‘vow’ by David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, in the left-wing Daily Record newspaper yesterday, amounts to Westminster capitulating to demands made by the Scottish left-wing establishment in recent years. Yet, despite having huge constitutional and financial implications for everybody in the UK, the three party leaders cooked them up behind closed doors without any proper debate – and with Gordon Brown at the fore. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK examines the ‘bribes’ which have been offered north of the border in a desperate attempt to sway tomorrow’s referendum. A financial sweetener that perpetuates a system by which Scotland gets £1,623 – 19 per cent – more expenditure per head than England. The Barnett formula, devised in the 1970s by then Labour Chief Secretary to the Treasury Joel Barnett, was meant as a temporary measure to solve rows in the Callaghan government over how much money should be allocated to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Desperate: The Yes vote has had a strong final push and almost all polls have the two sides neck and neck . But politicians have repeatedly ducked the challenge of reforming it – mostly for fear of provoking a row with the Scots. The decision is yet another U-turn by David Cameron who said in 2008 the formula ‘cannot last forever’. The idea of resources shared ‘equitably’ will raise a hollow laugh across the rest of the UK, given the capitulation over Barnett. Unlike those living in England, Scots are already able to enjoy free social care for the elderly and free student tuition. Wales claims the decision to preserve Barnett will leave the country £300million a year poorer than if money was allocated fairly. A counter to claims by Alex Salmond that the NHS is under threat from Westminster. The running of the health service north of the border is already the responsibility of Holyrood. But new powers – expected to allow Holyrood to vary the income tax rate by at least 15p in the pound – would allow extra money to be raised for healthcare. With Scotland in charge of every aspect of its own NHS, there is little or no justification for allowing Scottish MPs to continue to vote on the running of the NHS in England. Deal: Alex Salmond and David Cameron in 2012 signing the agreement which led to tomorrow's referendum . A statement seemingly tossed out without consideration of the constitutional implications. The Scottish Parliament is the result of legislation enacted by Westminster, which could be repealed. No Parliament can bind its successor – yet the leaders are promising to do exactly that. Experts say the only way to make Holyrood permanent would be to introduce the UK’s first ever written constitution – a task that could take Parliament years to achieve. Cameron, Clegg and Miliband have no agreement among their parties to give new powers to the Scots or change the constitution. The deal has been hatched behind closed doors, with Brown taking a lead role. Mr Cameron can expect a rebellion by Tory MPs who want an English parliament in which Scots can not sway the vote on issues with no effect on their constituents. What is certain is that, in the event of a No vote, the last nine months of the current Parliament will be dominated by the fallout. There is already resentment that the vow was made in a Scottish newspaper, without any warning.","Three main parties promise £1,300 more than average spent on every Scot .

"A carriage forming part of the train that carried Sir Winston Churchill’s body from his funeral is to be restored in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of his death. Built in 1931, the Southern Railway luggage van no.2464 carried the illustrious former Prime Minister from his State Funeral at St. Paul's Cathedral, London, to his final resting place in Oxfordshire on January 30 1965. But the carriage was not always used for such prestigious events - it was originally built to transport simple goods, such as vegetables and newspapers, around the country. The carriage formed part of the train that carried Sir Winston Churchill’s body from his funeral and is currently being restored to mark the 50th anniversary of his death . It has now been loaned to the National Railway Museum in Shildon, where it will be exhibited early next year once cosmetic restoration work is complete. Senior Curator of rail vehicles at the National Railway Museum, Anthony Coulls, said: 'Until the 1960s, the carriage was a fairly normal goods van. It carried things like vegetables and newspapers, goods that needed to go from place to place as soon as possible. 'The carriage shows how the every day can become something quote important, and it is assured of its place on the national stage because of the part it played in Churchill's last journey. 'It is not a glamorous steam engine but it is something that is of great importance to the nation. Senior curator of rail vehicles at the National Railway Museum, Anthony Coulls, is working on the restoration ahead of the anniversary of Churchill's funeral in January . The funeral of Sir Winston Churchill is seen from inside St Paul's Cathedral in 1965 - by decree of the Queen his body lay in State in Westminster Hall for three days . 'A lot of people still feel strongly about Churchill so it is good to commemorate that.' Churchill's funeral was watched by 300 million of people on television and attended by representatives from 112 nations. The day saw thousands line the streets of London, where they paid their respects to one of Britain's most historical figures. The procession travelled through London to St Paul's Cathedral for the funeral service, before Churchill was laid to rest in the Oxfordshire Parish Churchyard of Bladon, situated close to Blenheim Palace, where he was born 90 years earlier. The curator said: 'The carriage  is assured of its place on the national stage because of the part it played in Churchill's last journey' The carriage had humble beginnings and was originally made to carry simple goods like vegetables and newspapers before being used for evacuations in World War II . The carriage was initially used as part of two evacuation trains during World War II, before later being transformed into the original umber and cream Pullman colours in the 1960s. In 1966, it was moved to Los Angeles to be preserved, but it was returned to the UK in 2007 and became a part of the Swanage Railway Trust collection. On loan to the National Railway Museum from the Swanage Railway Trust, the carriage will be exhibited in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Churchill's State Funeral on January 30 next year. Crowds cram the pavements in silent farewell as the gun-carriage bearing the coffin of Sir Winston Churchill is drawn by naval ratings up Ludgate Hill to St. Paul's . The streets of London came to a standstill for what was the first State Funeral for a non-royal family member since 1914, the former PM pictured in 1956 (right) Winston Churchill was born in 1874 at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, to aristocratic parents Lord and Lady Randolph Churchill. He was said to be a poor pupil at school and did not have a close relationship with his mother or father - who died aged 45 when Churchill was 20. He married Clementine Hozier in 1908 and had five children, Diana, Randolph, Sara, Marigold and Mary. Churchill first joined the army in 1893 and had an illustrious military career which saw him sent to Cuba, India and Sudan. Alongside his military life, he also worked as a war reporter and was taken prisoner in South Africa while reporting on the Second Boer War in 1899. Also pursuing political ambitions, Churchill won the seat for Oldham in 1900, later serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Lord of the Admiralty twice. He first became Prime Minister in May 1940, following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain during World War II. During the conflict, he was seen as a pillar of strength  and gave several memorable speeches that inspired the British public including a famous 1940 address to Parliament in which he bellowed 'we shall fight on the beaches...we shall fight in the hills....we shall never surrender'. After losing the 1945 election, Churchill served as Leader of the Opposition for 6 years before becoming Prime Minster again in 1951. He suffered a series of strokes during the 1950s and resigned as Prime Minister in 1955 due to his failing health. He finally left Parliament, standing down at the 1964 General Election, and died on January 24 1965 at the age of 90 - exactly 70 years after his father.

According to police it was his 20th offence in a string of convictions which include burglary, robbery and handling stolen goods. Omar is the Olympic champion's half-brother as they share the same father Mukhtar. Farah, 21 pleaded guilty to one count of attempted burglary with intent to steal at Kingston Crown Court today. He had previously spoken about the support Mo, 31, had given him, seeing him as a role model, while in a 2013 interview he said he had been training as a graphic designer in a bid to avoid getting into trouble. Today a judge branded his criminal record 'unimpressive', although the court heard he had not committed any further crimes since he tried breaking into the pensioner's home at around 7am March 2 last year. Prosecutor José Olivares-Chandler said: 'There were two elderly Polish occupants in a downstairs bedroom of this residential premises. 'There were woken by noise and it became clear there was a stranger at the window. 'The male occupant saw an arm, shouted and disturbed that stranger who ran off across the front garden, through the gate and away.' The elderly couple slept in a ground floor bedroom which overlooking their front garden. Despite being woken by Farah they did not see him but his fingerprints were found on the window. The prosecutor continued: 'He was arrested at a later date after details were circulated and gave no comment during interview.' Kingston Crown Court heard that Farah, 21, had 'numerous offences for dishonesty' and two for burglary . The court heard how Farah, who lived in Brentford, west London, had a string of previous convictions including two for burglary. Mr Olivares-Chandler said: 'Your honour will see that he has 15 convictions for 20 offences. 'There are numerous offences for dishonesty, but the two the Crown would like to draw reference two are domestic burglaries. Farah, who has been in Wandsworth prison since May, appeared in the dock in a grey cricket jumper and dark blue jeans. He pleaded guilty to one count of attempted burglary with intent to steal after prosecutors agreed to drop a more serious charge of burglary with intent. Andrew Turton, defending, claimed he was an 'opportunist' who had seen the chance to break into the property after visiting his girlfriend nearby. He said: 'On the same road lived his girlfriend, this was an opportunist, spur-of-the-moment burglary.' Sentencing him to 15 months imprisonment Judge Jones said: 'You are 21 years of age and you have got an unimpressive criminal record. 'Apart from matters of theft you have two previous residential burglaries and you have offences of robbery and handling stolen goods - not an attractive record [and] have been in custody for a fair amount of time. 'I arrive that a final sentence of 15 months' imprisonment, you have been in custody for a good while but not long enough.'","Omar Farah admitted one count of  attempted burglary with intent to steal .

"Business magnate Donald Trump has suggested he may be about to throw a lifeline to the bankrupt Atlantic City casino  that shut its doors early this morning. Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino became the fourth casino to go belly-up in the city this year when its last few gamblers left the blackjack table at 6am. But Mr Trump hinted that this may not be the end of the line for the resort. The real estate mogul took to social media to say he is considering buying back into both Trump Plaza and the beleaguered Trump Taj Mahal. Scroll down for video . Mr Trump hinted that this may not be the end of the line for Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino . Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino became the fourth casino to go belly-up in the city this year when its last few gamblers left the blackjack table at 6am this morning . He tweeted: 'I left Atlantic City years ago, good timing. Now I may buy back in, at much lower price, to save Plaza & Taj. They were run badly by funds!' The businessman opened Trump Plaza in 1984, when he described it as the finest building in Atlantic City - and possibly the nation. But he cut ties several years ago, and last month filed a lawsuit to get his name taken off of it. Despite its prime location at the heart of the Boardwalk, gamblers have been abandoning Trump Plaza - which has seen better days - for newer, ritzier casinos for years. Its owners, Trump Entertainment Resorts, allowed the casino to deteriorate, particularly after a sale for the bargain-basement price of $20 million to a California firm fell through last year. Business magnate Donald Trump has hinted that he might be planning to save Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino . Mr Trump cut ties with the casino several years ago and last month filed a lawsuit to get his name taken off of it . A lightly populated gambling floor of the Trump Plaza before it became the fourth casino to close in Atlantic City . The parent company has  threatened to shutter the Trump Taj Mahal Casino resort in November, which has also been on a steady decline in recent years. Showing some nostalgia for the old days, Mr Trump tweeted: 'It is so sad to see what has happened to Atlantic City. So many bad decisions by the pols over the years - airport, convention center, etc.' He added: 'Does anybody notice that Atlantic City lost its magic after I left years ago. I had the big boxing, introduced UFC (ask Dana),the best shows.' Jim Redmond, 60, from Montreal adores Atlantic City and regularly stayed at Trump Plaza. He noted that the hotel and casino's decline was steady over the last seven years. 'It did slip every year,' he said. 'This year they had no bedspreads and they totally gave up on the ice machines. Burned-out: What remains of the lights in  the illuminated facade of Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino . 'This year the Plaza bar was closed and the 24 hour cafe closed at 2 p.m. The higher-end restaurants were closed. 'It was so sad to see it get a little worse every year. They really seemed to give up about five years ago.' Atlantic City began the year with 12 casinos. It now has eight. Dealer Ruth Hardrick worked at Trump Plaza for 26 of its 30 years, but is now without a job. She is one of the roughly 8,000 Atlantic City casino workers have lost their jobs this year, and another 3,000 could join them if Trump Taj Mahal also goes under. 'What's the next step? Where do we go from here?' she asked. 'It's happening all over. A lot of us are in the same boat. You think something will come along (to save the casino). And it didn't.' Illuminated letters of the casino's name on the building's front and back facades burned out and were never replaced. Visitors to the Miss America pageant last week at Boardwalk Hall next door saw a neon sign proclaiming 'Trump Plaz Hotel & Cas.' On the Boardwalk side, the sign read, 'U Laza.' Many restaurants on the first and third floors have been shut down for months. Along an escalator leading to them, fake plastic plants were either missing or stolen from row after row of trays. A self-serve kiosk to redeem player's club points near the parking garage was disconnected and covered in dust. So far this year, Trump Plaza has taken in just $36.8 million from gamblers. The figure is down 31.5 per cent from the same period last year, and about the same amount as the Borgata casino wins during an average two-week period. Trump Plaza is a mere shadow of the casino Mr Trump remembers from Atlantic city's heyday . Trump Entertainment Resorts, allowed the casino to deteriorate, particularly after a sale for the bargain-basement price of $20 million to a California firm fell through last year . Things have changed since Mr Trump opened the casino in the summer of 1984. At the time he described it as the finest building in Atlantic City - and possibly the nation .

"Samuel Amin, 18, went missing at 2am on Saturday after leaving a bar next to the River Avon in Bath, Somerset . Fears were mounting yesterday that a teenager who vanished on a night out may have drowned in a notorious stretch of river - the sixth in five years. Samuel Amin, 18, went missing at 2am on Saturday after leaving a bar next to the River Avon in Bath, Somerset. Five people have drowned in the river since 2009 and there have been calls for increased safety measures. Samuel is described as being of Asian appearance, 5ft 7ins tall, of slim build with black short hair. He was wearing blue jeans and a red and black lumber-style jacket when he was last seen leaving OPA bar. Avon and Somerset Police has not begun searching the river but are still looking for the teenager. A spokesman said: 'If you see Samuel or know where he is, please call our 24-hour Police Enquiry Centre on 101 and quote reference MP2338/14.' Two people have already drowned this year after falling into the river - which runs right through the city centre - on nights out. In January Christopher Taylor, 21, drowned despite desperate attempts from the emergency services who raced to the scene. Then in April the body of Donovan Weale, 42, was pulled out of the water but he was pronounced dead at the Royal United Hospital in Bath. Other deaths in the river include Kharunigan Jayanatham in 2009, graphic designer Casper Flagg also in 2009, and Bath Spa University student James Bubear in 2011. All of the men had been returning from nights out when they went missing, apart from Kharunigan Jayanatham who lost his footing while on the phone and fell into the river. Five people have drowned in the river since 2009 and there have been calls for increased safety measures. File picture . Last year, a 930-yard stretch of fencing was put up along the towpath between Windsor Bridge and Victoria Bridge to improve safety. Calls were again made at the start of this year though to further improve safety following the most recent deaths. Three years ago, a Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents report made a series of recommendations to make the waterways safer, such as better highlighting ladders or placing signs dissuading people from walking along a towpath when drunk.","Samuel Amin, 18, went missing at 2am on Saturday after leaving a bar in Bath, Somerset .

"ISIS has made 'credible threats' to kill  Pope Francis, a top Iraqi diplomat has warned just days before the Pontiff visits the mainly Muslim nation of Albania. Habeeb Al Sadr issued the stark warning today  after Vatican officials insisted there was no threat to his safety - and said he will not ride in the bulletproof 'Popemobile' of his predecessor Benedict XVI. Mr Al Sadr, Iraq's ambassador to the Holy See, admitted he knew of no 'specific facts' or 'operational projects' but said: 'Just put two and two together... They want to kill the Pope.' Scroll down for video . Warning: The Pope will use the open-top car (pictured) from which he greets the faithful in St Peter's Square when he visits Albania on Sunday, despite Iraq's ambassador saying his life is in danger from ISIS extremists . Habeeb Al Sadr, said: 'Threats against the Pope are credible. Public statements and crimes against Christianity by Isis are a fact. Just put two and two together.' But the Pope calls his bulletproof glass vehicle a 'sardine can' Beloved: The Pope pictured at a Mass to celebrate several weddings at St Peter's Basilica on Sunday . The ambassador said the spread of extremists across the world meant Pope Francis is at risk anywhere - in Muslim countries, on trips to Britain and the U.S. and even in Rome. He told the Italian newspaper La Nazione: 'Threats against the Pope are credible. Public statements and crimes against Christianity by ISIS are a fact. Just put two and two together. 'Let me be clear, I am not aware of specific facts or operational projects. But what has been said by the self-declared ""Islamic state"" terrorists is clear. They want to kill the Pope. 'I think they could try to hit him during his travels or even in Rome, because there are members of ISIS who are not Arabs but also Canadians, Americans, French, British and Italian. 'This gang of criminals does not merely threaten. In Iraq they have violated or  destroyed some of the holiest sites of Shia Islam. They have hit places of worship in the Yazidi religion  and Christianity. They  forced 150,00 Christians to flee Mosul.' 'Sardine can': An armoured Popemobile was introduced after the 1981 assassination attempt on John Paul II (pictured in Nigeria) but Pope Francis has said he dislikes the vehicle and would prefer not to use it . Outdated: Pope Benedict XVI waves from the armoured vehicle in 2006 on a visit to Munich, Germany. The Iraqi ambassador warned the current Pontiff is at risk everywhere - including in Britain and the U.S. or even Rome . The ambassador said the ethos of the terrorists was 'convert or be killed' and described their murderous spread through Iraq as a 'genocide'. But he added Christians could not be 'prisoners of fear' and called on the Pope to send 'a message of hope to the Christians of the Middle East and around the world'. Iraqi ambassador to the Vatican Habeeb Al Sadr said visits to the UK and U.S. would also be dangerous . He added: 'With his wisdom and his courage could make this visit a bridge between our religions, a message of peace in the name of Abraham.' Iraq had among the first Christians in the world, in the form of Assyrians who have faced centuries of persecution since. Up to a million Christians are thought to have fled the country since British and U.S. troops invaded in 2003, with the violence of ISIS militants triggering a new exodus. The terrorists follow an extremist interpretation of Sunni Islam, declaring Shia Muslims and Sunnis who refused to kill as sworn enemies. Pope Francis will make a brief 11-hour visit to Albania, more than half of whose citizens are Sunni Muslims, this Sunday to mark the rebirth of religion after Communism fell in the early 1990s. He will celebrate Mass in a square named for Albania's most famous Catholic, Mother Teresa, in a bid to show how Catholics, Orthodox Christians and Muslims now live in harmony in the country where Catholics were once executed and sent to work camps. He is also due to visit Turkey at the end of November. Italian newspapers have claimed security sources fear violent jihadis previously in Iraq and Syria could return to their home countries and carry out an attack. Marauders: The terrorists under the self-styled banner 'Islamic State' have swept through Iraq and Syria . Isolated: The militants have declared Christians, Yazidi people and even other Sunni Muslims as their enemies . But the Vatican  insisted security officials were 'calm' about the visit this Sunday. Spokesman the Rev Federico Lombardi said the Pope will greet the crowds from the same open-top white car he uses in St Peter's Square. It makes a striking change from the moving bulletproof glass booth which entered regular use after the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in 1981. While his predecessor Benedict XVI  regularly appeared behind the glass, the Argentinian Pontiff ditched the 'sardine can' vehicle in June after saying it kept him too far from the faithful. Mr Lombardi said officials were concerned about ISIS, but added: 'There are no specific threats or risks that would change the pope's behaviour or the way the trip is organised.' The terrorists fight under the banners Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) - now calling themselves simply Islamic State. They have swept through the Middle East taking soldiers by surprise, killing thousands of people and recruiting hundreds of jihadis from western countries including Britain.","Pontiff due to visit Albania, which is majority Sunni Muslim, this Sunday .

"With these charming sculptures made of butter, it’s easy to see why artist Vipular Athukorale’s reputation is spreading fast. But be careful not to warm to them too much, or they’ll be toast. The sculptures measure up to two feet long and take months at a time to make. They include a vintage Rolls-Royce and a scene from Little Red Riding Hood. A soft touch: Talented artist - and former chef - Vipular Athukorale spends months at a time carefully crafting the slippery sculptures, including this one showing a scene from Little Red Riding Hood . The latter last week won the food art award at the Culinary Olympics, an international cuisine competition held every four years in Germany, although presumably it was a knife-edge decision. Mr Athukorale, 49, needs a smooth touch when painstakingly crafting the scenes using tiny scalpels. He said: ‘I started making butter sculptures nearly 30 years ago when I was working as a chef.

"Bride-to-be Kirsty Thomas spotted the wedding dress of her dreams and knew she had to have it. There was just one problem - she needed to lose 5st to fit into the A-line dress. Kirsty  weighed 15st 4lb and was a size 16 when she spotted the dress but discovered it was only made in a size 8. Scroll down for video . Kirsty, pictured before her weight loss, says she has also gained weight easily . Kirsty pictured in her dream size eight wedding dress on her special day in May this year . Determined Kirsty bought the dress anyway - and amazingly managed to lose all the weight ahead of her big day. Kirsty, 25, said: 'When I saw the dress, I just knew that I had to have it. 'The fact that it was only available in a size 8 was just the incentive I needed to really transform my life and get back into shape. 'I wanted a wedding album that I could be proud of and I knew the only way I was going to be able to achieve my goal was to fit into that dress.' Kirsty, from Maesteg, Bridgend, said: 'I had always put on a weight quite easily and needed to be careful what I ate. A chronic snacker, on a bad day Kirsty would eat whole pack of Jaffa Cakes . Kirsty was so overweight she found it difficult at times to keep balance and kept falling . 'I am the type of person who can easily put on 4lb over the course of a weekend if eating lots of fattening things and having ice cream for dessert. 'I noticed my weight creeping up and obviously that affected my general self-esteem. 'I put on a lot of weight after the birth of my eldest son. You are told when you are pregnant that you can eat for two, but that is a complete myth. 'You only need a few more calories in the very late stages of the pregnancy but otherwise you should just eat as you would normally. 'I put on a stone and a half throughout the pregnancy and I didn't lose it after my son was born.' She was so overweight she found it difficult at times to keep balance and kept falling. Her doctor said the falls were because of her weight. Kirsty's final trigger which encouraged to knuckle down and diet was a holiday in the Dominican Republic . Switching to a healthier low-fat diet, cutting out the snacking and beginning to exercise saw the pounds fall off . The final trigger which encouraged her to knuckle down and diet was a holiday in the Dominican Republic. Kirsty said: 'I remember walking down the beach and being approached by a group of women who were all in great shape and looked amazing in their bikinis. 'I felt so self-conscious because I was so badly out of shape and could see they were looking at me. I knew I had to change.' Mother-of-two Kirsty had bought the dress last August and when she finally tied the knot in May this year - just nine months later - she was a shapely size 8 weighing just 9st 12lb. She had lost a staggering 76lb, or 5st 4lb, - more than half a stone a month - and got the body she had always wanted. Kirsty achieved this feat by completely changing her diet and exercising regularly. She had previously snacked throughout the day and was incapable of just having one of her favourite Jaffa Cakes - on a bad day, she could munch her way through a whole packet. Kirsty was able to fit into her dream dress just nine months after buying it four sizes too small . Her other downfall was bread - she would eat five or six slices alongside her evening meal. Kirsty switched to a healthier low-fat diet, cut out the snacking and started eating low-calorie bread. She also started taking Forza Supplements Raspberry K2 capsules which she says helped take the edge off her appetite at weak moments and gave her extra energy to exercise more. And if she ever needed an extra incentive to carry on with the diet, she just looked at the white dress in the cupboard and dreamed of the day she would be able to fit into it. Kirsty said she felt like a new woman as she got back into shape. She said: 'Once I put my mind to it, I found it quite straightforward. Kirsty says her wedding day was the 'happiest' of her life and that she loved looking at the pictures afterwards . 'The Forza Raspberry K2 capsules were a big help. I started walking a lot and they gave me real energy and helped me to get out more.' At the end of her weight loss journey Kirsty was finally at the right weight to fit into her wedding dress. 'It meant so much to me,' she said. 'The dress fitted me perfectly and looked just as wonderful when I had bought it as a size 16 all those months ago. 'My wedding day was the happiest of my life and I loved looking at the pictures afterwards.

"A table drawn up by Oxfam showed The Netherlands is the best place to eat while Chad is the worst. The U.S. didn't make it into the top 20 . The Netherlands is the best place in the world to eat, according to new research. In contrast, people in Chad are the worst off when it comes to their food consumption. The UK only made number 13 in the survey while the U.S. came in at 21 on the table of the best countries to eat in terms of nutritional value and availability. The new report compiled by Oxfam saw researchers look at the food consumption in 125 countries. The researchers considered whether people have enough to eat, whether people can afford to eat, whether the food available is of good quality and the extent of diet related diseases. The results showed that the Netherlands is the best place in the world to eat, followed by France and Switzerland. The Netherlands took the top spot because it has comparatively low food prices, low diabetes levels and better nutritional diversity than its European rivals. Also in the top 12 were Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Australia, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and Portugal. However, these countries did not score well in all categories. The Netherlands has high levels of obesity with almost one in five of its population with a body mass index of more than 30. The healthy level is 18 to 25. Of the top rating countries, Australia has the highest obesity levels – 27 per cent of Australians are obese. At the bottom of the table, Chad is shown to be the worst place to eat as the food is of little nutritional value, it is expensive and it prepared with limited access to hygienic conditions. One in three children in Chad are also underweight. Joining Chad at the bottom of the table are Ethiopia and Angola. The rest of the bottom 10 are made up of sub-Saharan African countries and Yemen. All but one of the top 10 worst countries in terms of food availability, affordability and quality, were in sub-Saharan Africa . In these countries, diets are dominated by nutrient-poor cereals, roots and root vegetables. The research also revealed that the USA has the most affordable food in the world while Angola has the least affordable. Quality of food is highest in Iceland and it is lowest in Madagascar. The highest rate of diabetes is in Saudi Arabia and the country with the greatest obesity problem is Kuwait. 1. The Netherlands . 2. France . 3. Switzerland . 4. Denmark . 5. Sweden . 6. Austria . 7.

In contrast, there is very little obesity in Bangladesh, Nepal and Ethiopia. The Oxfam report shows that malnutrition is most prevalent in Burundi where 67 per cent of people are undernourished and 35 per cent of children are underweight. Yemen was the next worst for malnutrition followed by India and Madagascar. In India, 44 per cent of children were found to be underweight – the highest rate in the world. In contrast, in Saudi Arabia 18 per cent of people are diabetic and a third are obese. Kuwait has the highest level of obesity – 42 per cent - and in the U.S. and Egypt a third of the populations are also obese. Surprisingly, there are also high levels of obesity in some middle-income countries. The Netherlands was the best place to eat because the food is affordable and nutritionally diverse . Fiji, Mexico and Venezuela are all among the worst 10. The report does note, however, that the highest levels of obesity in the world are actually found in the Pacific Islands but that they were not included in the study. The island of Nauru has the highest obesity rates in the world – 71 per cent of the population is obese. Following the completion of the research, Oxfam has drawn up a list of things that need to be done to address some of the problems. These include investing in small-holder agriculture, tackling climate change and better regulating food speculation to prevent high price rises.","The rankings are based on the food availability, affordability, quality, and the rate of diet-related illnesses in each country .

"A handyman has been jailed for 10 years after he accidentally killed his girlfriend with a homemade cannon. Richard Fox, a 41-year-old explosives enthusiast, was loading the cannon at his trailer park home in Petrero - a small mountain community close to California's border with Mexico - when it exploded unexpectedly. Shrapnel from the unintentional blast penetrated the trailer, instantly killing Fox's girlfriend Jeanette Ogara, 38, but leaving the couple's four-year-old daughter Vanessa unharmed. Fox pleaded guilty to felony charges relating to the explosion of a destructive device causing death, and possession of materials to carry out such an act - with the prosecution accepting his argument that it had never been his intention to kill his girlfriend. Tragic: Shrapnel from the  cannon blast penetrated a trailer, instantly killing Jeanette Ogara, 38, (left). Richard Fox, 41, (right) has now been jailed for 10 years for the explosion of a destructive device causing death . The freak accident took place on March 3, 2012 when Fox and a friend stood outside the trailer drinking alcohol while they loaded the homemade cannon with powder extracted from fireworks. The 21-inch-long, two-inch-thick steel pipe exploded before he had finished preparing it, badly burning Fox and scattering large chunks of metal around the area. Several pieces of shrapnel penetrated the walls of the nearby trailer, where Fox had lived with Ms Ogara and their young daughter for a number of years. Ms Ogara was killed instantly, but the child and three other adults in the home were unharmed. Fox reportedly broke down in tears during his sentencing at the El Cajon branch of the San Diego County Superior Court, pleading with the family of his late girlfriend for forgiveness. 'I am truly sorry from the bottom of my heart,' the LA Times quoted him as saying. Pain: Richard Fox (pictured here earlier in his trial) broke down in tears during his sentencing at the El Cajon branch of the San Diego County Superior Court, pleading with the family of his late girlfriend for forgiveness . Scene: The freak accident took place on March 3, 2012 when Fox and a friend stood outside the trailer (pictured) drinking alcohol while they loaded the homemade cannon with powder extracted from fireworks . During the trial John Arnold, a neighbor, told U-T San Diego said Fox: 'liked experimenting with guns, and it looks like this experiment went bad.' He added that Fox 'adores Jeanette and Vanessa. They mean the world to him. I can’t imagine how he feels right now. He probably doesn’t want to live.' Moments after the cannon went off Fox phoned his brother Jerry and said: 'I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it should have been me.' Fox was treated at a hospital for shrapnel wounds to his right leg and arrested for investigation of exploding a device resulting in death.

"Catalan Dragons scrum-half Sam Williams is to rejoin Canberra Raiders following the French club's capture of Todd Carney. The 23-year-old Williams joined the Dragons on a short-term deal from St George Illawarra in June with a view to earning a long-term contract but is now headed back to the club at which his career began. Williams has played in nine of their last 11 matches but the anticipated arrival of Carney on a three-year deal means there will be no place for Williams at Stade Gilbert Brutus, where Thomas Bosc and Scott Dureau, who returned to Australia this summer to complete his recovery from injury, will compete for the scrum-half role. Sam William is headed back to Canberra with the arrival of Todd Carney squeezing him out of Catalans . Williams, who has signed a two-year deal with the Raiders, will make his final appearance for the Dragons if they lose their elimination play-off at Leeds on Saturday. 'Sam is a gifted playmaker who we believe will be a valuable asset for our squad,' said Raiders recruitment and high-performance manager David Hamilton. Williams played 42 first-grade matches for the Raiders before moving to St George in 2013. Todd Carney is set to be thrown a lifeline by Super League club Catalan Dragons after his NRL axing . Former State of Origin star Carney was de-registered from the NRL after being sacked by Cronulla . 'The Raiders are my home club with some of my best mates and a club I've always wanted to see successful so I'd love to be a part of any success we have in the future,' Williams said. Meanwhile, the Catalans are waiting for the Rugby Football League's board of directors to formally give the green light for them to register the 28-year-old Carney, who was de-registered by the NRL in June following a breach of discipline with Cronulla. Carney has previously been moved on from Canberra and the Sydney Roosters.","Sam Williams will return to the NRL as Catalans look to unveil Todd Carney .

"The Scottish independence referendum is still two days away, but the blame game has already begun. With the race still neck-and-neck, David Cameron is at pains to stress that other party leaders in Westminster backed his decision to give Alex Salmond his historic vote on separation. Amid claims those around the Prime Minister ignored warnings about the chance of Yes vote, Downing Street insiders insisted the campaign would be won and lost on Labour votes. Scroll down for video . David Cameron faces being the Prime Minister who oversaw the break-up of the Union, with critics claiming he left it too late to deliver the passion seen in last night's speech in Aberdeen . Mr Cameron today joined Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg in signing a joint 'vow' to devolve more powers to Scotland. But critics say the offer should have been made earlier, with some saying so-called Devo-Max should have been an option on the ballot paper in Thursday's vote. One former minister told The Times: 'It's 'essay crisis' politics. This is the worst example but it's part of a pattern. The whole thing has been a total shambles.' Last night Mr Cameron sought to deflect criticism of the decision to offer only a straight yes-no vote. He told BBC's Newsnight: 'I think it was right to have one question, because of course if Scotland wants more devolution, and I think Scotland wants more devolution, you have to answer the prior question: Do you want to stay in the UK? 'Of course that wasn't just my view, that was the view of the leaders of other UK parties who all thought it was important, let's settle the question of separation and then look at devolution. 'In this campaign the individual parties have set out their proposals, they've been quite strikingly similar, so it's been possible to make progress.' The Financial Times today reported claims that senior civil servants raised the alarm about the risks of the break-up of the UK. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and his predecessor Lord O'Donnell are both said to have been concerned about the threat posed by the Yes campaign. Government sources say it is up to Labour heavyweights like Gordon Brown, giving a speech in Clydebank today, to secure victory for the No campaign . Early in the referendum campaign, Sir Jeremy is said to have told ministers to make efforts to win over Yes voters, the newspaper reported. The Cabinet Office said this was 'simply not true', adding that the government's focus had been 'entirely on getting to the right outcome. Ministers and the civil service have worked hard to make the case for the UK'. Mr Cameron last night made his tenth and final trip to Scotland of the campaign, urging voters not to plunge the Union into a 'painful divorce'. He appeared teary-eyed as he issued his most emotional plea yet to voters ahead of Thursday's historic referendum: 'Please don't break this family apart.' But behind the scenes, aides admit the speech is likely to have little impact on the result. Some 99 per cent of Tories in Scotland are planning to vote No, according to some polls, and Mr Cameron's is deeply unpopular outside his own party. While the battle is being played out in Scotland, the implications of a Yes vote could have dire consequences in Westminster . Instead the biggest group being targeted by both sides in the campaign is working-class Labour supporters in the west of Scotland. Labour big beasts including Gordon Brown, John Reid, Ed Miliband and Alistair Darling have hit the campaign trail hard in recent days, after polls show support for independence among labour voters had almost doubled to 30 per cent. 'There is a real battle going on for Labour votes, and it is down to Labour to win it,' said a government source. 'It could all come down to 30 square miles and Glasgow, and it is up to Ed Miliband to deliver his voters for us.' Mr Cameron's passionate speech last night, which followed a similarly teary-eyed address in Edinburgh last week, has been well received. But many observers argued the same passion should have been shown much earlier in the campaign, with thousands of postal votes already cast. But Mr Cameron against sought to deflect criticism from his role as Prime Minister in the campaign. He told the BBC: 'It's not a campaign of the Conservative party against the SNP - it's a campaign of all of those parties and trade unions and voluntary bodies and charities and people who have nothing to do with politics who want Scotland to stay part of our family of nations and those who want us to leave.'

"More than 400 war heroes, army generals and rank-and-file soldiers have issued a plea to Scottish voters warning that independence would leave Britain's defences ‘irresponsibly weakened’. The former servicemen and women - who are all eligible to vote - have signed a statement entitled ‘We are stronger when we stand together’ urging Scots to vote against separation on Thursday. The signatories boast a who’s who of Scotland’s military history over the last seventy years, including six former heads of the Army in Scotland and the two WW2 veterans who helped sink the Bismark and its sister ship the Tirpitz - Lt Cdr Jock Moffat and Lt Cdr John Lorimer. In the statement, the veterans warn voters that the only way to safeguard Scotland’s interests in the future is to vote against independence. Scroll down for video . Warning: Military veterans including Jock Moffat, left, and John Lorimer, right, have spoken out against Scottish independence . They said: ‘As former members of the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force who are proud to call Scotland our home, we passionately believe that the people of Scotland will be stronger and more secure if we remain part of the United Kingdom. ‘We are in no doubt that were Scotland to break away from the United Kingdom the current arrangements for defending all these islands would be irresponsibly weakened.’ ‘We recognise that when deciding which way to vote we will all be influenced by many different factors. However in defence terms there is no question about it. We are a great deal better together.’ The statement also expressed concern over the SNP’s plans to set up a separate Scottish Defence Force with a budget of just £2.5billion a year. Plans: Alex Salmond says that an independent Scotland would set up a £2.5billion Scottish Defence Force . ‘We see no evidence that the SNP’s proposals for the defence and security of an independent Scotland could possibly provide us with a credible, effective defence force capable of securing the interests of Scotland and our people. ‘Britain’s armed forces represent a potent safeguard against those who mean us harm.’ It adds that Scotland stands to lose thousands of highly-skilled and high-value jobs in the wider defence industry, while Britain’s military would continue to offer ‘challenging and rewarding careers’ for many Scots if the union remains intact. ‘We are very proud of the remarkable contribution that Scots men and women have made to the Armed Forces and the important and integral part we have played in preserving our nation’s freedom and safeguarding our interests.’ Heritage: The Black Watch, one of the best-known Scottish battalions, while deployed in Iraq in 2004 . One signatory, Captain Frankie Caldwell of the Royal Tank Regiment, who left the army in 2010 after 27 years, added: ‘I have very strong emotional ties to the union. It would absolutely break my heart to see the Scottish element of the Union flag unpicked and separated from it when I’ve fought together with my English, Welsh and Northern Irish comrades.’ Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, added: ‘In no area is the case for our United Kingdom better made than in defence. Why, on this small island, would we split up the defences that have kept us safe for centuries?’ ‘We are stronger and safer together. These veterans know it and will be voting to keep Scotland secure as part of the United Kingdom on Thursday.’","400 soldiers write open letter urging Scots to vote against independence .

"For the first time in years, more than 1 million New Yorkers are smoking, according to data released Monday, marking a disturbing rise of tobacco use in the city that pioneered a number of anti-smoking initiatives that were emulated nationally. Sixteen percent of adult New Yorkers smoked in 2013, up from 14 percent in 2010, which was the city's lowest recorded rate, according to the findings released by New York City's Department of Health. Paula Halton, smoking a cigarette outside a Manhattan building on Monday, found it hard to believe there had been an increase in the numbers of smokers. Uptick: NYC's Department of Health released data Monday showing that for the first time since 2007 there are over 1 million smokers in the city. Mayor Bloomberg (at an anti-tobacco summit at right) made a huge push during his administration to curb smoking in the city. At left, former child star Ashley Olsen smokes a cigarette in New York City . 'I feel definitely like a minority compared to what it used to be,' the 39-year-old Brooklyn resident said. 'I can't imagine an adult picking up smoking now.' The rise in 2013, which is the most recent data available, is striking since it comes as smoking rates fall across the country. However, the national average — 18 percent — is still higher than it is in New York. The findings were culled from answers to the department's annual health survey of thousands city residents. 'We've had a plateau in the smoking rate for a couple of years, but now it is a statistically significant increase,' said Dr. Mary Bassett, the city's health commissioner. 'We now know the rise is real and we aim to do something about it.' Under Michael Bloomberg, who served 12 years as mayor beginning in 2002, New York radically reshaped its plans to curb smoking among its residents. Bloomberg's signature health initiative was to bar smoking in public parks and most other public places, including bars and restaurants, across the nation's largest city. While those decisions originally sparked controversy, the policy was later embraced by most New Yorkers and copied across the U.S. The city also funded several hard-hitting campaigns that used graphic imagery of smoke-damaged internal organs — and depictions of amputations and other smoking-related health complications — to scare off users, particularly children. Puffing away: Sixteen percent of adult New Yorkers smoked in 2013, up from 14 percent in 2010, which was the city's lowest recorded rate. Here, a pedestrian smokes in the pedestrian plaza near Times Square in New York . Moreover, a pack of cigarettes purchased in New York City is subject to more taxes than any other municipality in the nation. Bassett believes that city budget cutbacks caused by the economic downturn of the last six years is the largest culprit for the rise. 'The city used a whole host of tools to drive down smoking,' said Bassett, who was appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio after he took office in January. 'But we know we haven't been able to maintain the foot on the gas in the same way.' The city had to scale back on expensive television advertising and did away with some of its programs aimed at helping people quit, including one to provide nicotine replacements to smokers. The culture of smoking has also changed, Bassett said. The city has seen a rise in part-time smokers — including some social smokers who don't turn to cigarettes every day — and that is the demographic being targeted by the government's new $830,000 ad campaign entitled 'Imagine for Life.' 'We're aiming at smokers who think they don't smoke enough for it to hurt him,' Bassett said. 'This is a product that is not safe in any amount.' Bassett said the city also aims to bolster its support system for would-be quitters and emphasized that despite the recent rise in smoking, the number of smokers is still 25 percent lower than it was in 2002.

"A man surprised his girlfriend with the proposal of her dreams when he leapt out of Nick Saban's private bathroom  and presented her with a ring. Drew Clayton called in a favor from Saban, football coach the University of Alabama, and planted himself in his office, where now-fiancee Kayla Posey works as a student assistant. He swapped  the 2012 BCS National Championship ring on Saban's coffee table with Kayla's custom-made diamond, according to AL.com. Scroll down for video . Kayla Posey works as a student assistant for Nick Saban at the University of Alabama, where she also studies . Kayla began shining the rings on the coffee table with her dress before noticing that one of them was actually her custom-made diamond ring swapped in by Drew earlier that day . In need of a hiding place, Drew took up position in Saban's bathroom while he waited to carry out the less-than-conventional proposal. Nick Saban, who was once named the Most Powerful Coach in Sports by Forbes, previously served as head coach of the National Football League's Miami Dolphins. He has also coached for three other universities, including Louisiana State University, Michigan State University, and the University of Toledo. Kayla's co-workers at Saban's office helped orchestrate the plan, and sent her out to lunch on the day of the proposal so Clayton could set up. 'One of my main jobs was giving tours of the athletic facility,' Kayla said. 'I had four tours that day, so I was all dressed up, and my co-workers told me another tour had been added at the last minute.' Her now fiancé said: 'For 30 minutes, my stomach is churning and I'm waiting on Kayla to get back. 'It was a very well-kept bathroom, as we would expect from such a perfect coach.' Kayla got the shock of her life when boyfriend Drew sprung out of the bathroom and dropped to one knee . While waiting for her, Drew killed time by tucking into a box of Oatmeal Creme Pies he found in the bathroom. 'I was kind of hungry, so I figured he wouldn't miss one,' he said. Kayla had been told that an important guest was on his way and that she needed to shine the rings in Saban's office for the occasion. 'When I got into the office, one of the national championship boxes was closed,' she said. 'I started cleaning it with my dress and I opened the box.' Kayla said she was overwhelmed by everything Drew and her co-workers had done to pull off 'one of the greatest days of her life' -  which was all captured by a hidden camera .

"South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright has resigned after weeks of pressure . Rotherham's crime tsar finally caved in to three weeks of public outrage and quit yesterday over the sexual abuse of 1,400 children in the town. Shaun Wright, who had defied demands from political leaders of all parties to resign as South Yorkshire’s police and crime commissioner and refused to see why he should take any blame, claimed he was leaving ‘for the sake of the victims’. An acting commissioner will be appointed until a by-election is held, but former home secretary David Blunkett, who was among the MPs to welcome Mr Wright’s departure, rejected calls to stand as the region’s next PCC. It later emerged Mr Wright will not get a severance pay-off, but will keep his local authority pension, which he can claim from the age of 55. Mr Wright has faced demands to quit since a report by Professor Alexis Jay revealed that the authorities had repeatedly ignored warnings about the abuse of children by predominantly Asian men in Rotherham over 16 years. For five years until 2010, Mr Wright was at the heart of official failure to tackle the problem as the Labour councillor in charge of children’s services. He later successfully stood for election as the party’s PCC candidate. He refused to quit after the report’s publication last month, despite calls by the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary, the Deputy Prime Minister and Labour Party chiefs. He resigned from the party, pre-empting Labour attempts to sack him, but remained determined to hold on to his £85,000-a-year PCC job even after a humiliating appearance before a committee of MPs and emotional scenes at a public meeting in Rotherham, where women who had been abused as children denounced him. But yesterday he issued a statement saying the row was ‘detracting from the important issue, which should be everybody’s focus – the 1,400 victims in the report – and in providing support to victims and bringing to justice the criminals responsible for the atrocious crimes committed against them’. ‘With this in mind,’ he added, ‘I feel it is now right to step down . . . for the sake of those victims, for the sake of the public of South Yorkshire and to ensure the important issues outlined in the report about tackling child sexual exploitation can be discussed and considered in full and without distraction.’ Scroll down for video . His resignation came after a report found 1,400 had been abused over a 15-year period in Rotherham . A mother of one sexual abuse victim in the town said his late decision showed ‘how arrogant and indifferent he is’. The woman, whose 17-year-old daughter claims she was groomed on social media and abused by men in the region, said: ‘I hope he’s the first in a long line. ‘We need to get the rest of them out and then we’ll know that children in Rotherham are safe.’ Sarah Champion, Labour MP for Rotherham, said she was delighted Mr Wright had quit, but frustrated he did not do so as soon as the report came out because ‘he has taken the attention away from the victims and he has become the story. It is like a double insult to the victims and because of that I still feel very angry towards him’. John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said Mr Wright had ‘finally done the decent thing’ but for many it was ‘too little, too late’. He added Mr Wright had ‘failed the people of Rotherham and to try to remain in his post as police and crime commissioner was an insult to the victims and their families’. Mr Blunkett said it was a great pity that Mr Wright did not step down immediately. Theresa May, the Home Secretary, said she was pleased he had quit, adding: ‘It is right that where people failed in their duty they should take responsibility. The police and local council failed the victims of these awful crimes and failed the people of Rotherham.’ Mr Wright has been harangued in public meetings since the report revealed 'blatant' failures by authorities . Rotherham child abuse victim Sarah Wilson, whose sister Laura was murdered by a member of an Asian paedophile ring, confronted South Yorkshire police chief Shaun Wright earlier this month . 'My role as South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner has clearly become prominent in terms of public opinion and media coverage following the publication of Professor Alexis Jay's report. 'This is detracting from the important issue, which should be everybody's focus - the 1,400 victims outlined in the report - and in providing support to victims and bringing to justice the criminals responsible for the atrocious crimes committed against them. 'With this in mind, I feel that it is now right, to step down from the position of Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire, for the sake of those victims, for the sake of the public of South Yorkshire and to ensure that the important issues outlined in the report about tackling child sexual exploitation can be discussed and considered in full and without distraction. 'As I've previously stated, I entered into public service to make a positive difference in South Yorkshire. 'Protecting vulnerable people and particularly victims of child sexual exploitation has been my number one priority as Commissioner and much progress has been made over the last two years. 'My intention had always been to continue my work with South Yorkshire Police and partners in making all the necessary changes and improvements required to safeguard and support the victims of these horrific crimes, and indeed to protect further potential victims through preventative actions. 'On resigning, I therefore truly wish the force, all the very best in continuing the journey of positive transformational change of those essential services which protect and support our most vulnerable people.'","Shaun Wright was in charge of children's services before police role .

"The supermarket price war has driven down inflation to a four a half year low, official figures revealed this morning. Falling prices at the pump and grocery price cuts saw inflation drop to 1.5 per cent last month. It means CPI inflation has been below its target of 2 per cent for eight months in a row - the longest such run since 2005. The 'Consumer Price Index' measures inflation by tracking the price of an ordinary basket of everyday consumer goods - but does not include housing costs. It has been  below 2 per cent for eight months . The figure may ease pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates which have been at the historic low of 0.5 per cent for more than five years. Chancellor George Osborne tweeted: ‘Good news inflation has fallen again to just 1.5 per cent, below the 2 per cent target. But people still feeling impact of the Great Recession, so more to do.’ Chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander added: ‘Today's inflation figures are another step on the long road to our economic recovery after the great crash of 2008.’ But Labour shadow Treasury minister Catherine McKinnell said: ‘While this fall in the rate of inflation is welcome, the squeeze on working people continues.’ ‘The most recent figures show pay rising by a record low of just 0.6 per cent - less than half the rate of inflation. Wages after inflation have now fallen by over £1,600 a year under this Government.’ IHS Global Insight chief UK economist Howard Archer said August's muted CPI inflation figure was welcome news for consumers' purchasing power as they continue to be hampered by low earnings growth. Discount supermarkets like Aldi have eaten into the established giants' share of the market, helping to drive down the price of a weekly shop . He pointed out that inflation of 1.5 per cent in August was still more than double current underlying earnings growth of just 0.6 per cent in the three months to June. IHS Global Insight expects the Bank to raise interest rates to 0.75 per cent from 0.5 per cent in February, but added low inflation meant there was a growing possibility this could be delayed until the second quarter of next year. Mr Archer added: ‘An interest rate hike would highly likely be delayed if the Scots vote for independence on Thursday and there are signs that the economy is being adversely affected in the uncertain aftermath.’ Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said stable energy bills, lower import prices and weak wage growth will enable inflation to fall to as low as 1 per cent by the end of this year and remain weak in 2015. He said: ‘Although the low inflation outlook is unlikely to prevent the Bank's monetary policy committee from raising interest rates entirely over the next couple of years, it should limit the speed at which they rise.’ Food and drink prices fell by 0.2 per cent between July and August and are now 1.1 per cent lower than a year earlier - the biggest figure since June 2002. There was also downward pressure on the prices of furniture and household equipment. These falls offset rises among clothing and footwear, which jumped by 2.6 per cent between July and August. Alcohol and tobacco also rose 1 per cent between the same period. Today's data showed the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation, which includes housing costs, also fell to 2.4 per cent from 2.5 per cent.","CPI inflation has been below its target of 2% for eight months in a row .

"It was the writing refuge that inspired Evelyn Waugh to write the opening 1,300 words of Brideshead Revisited by the first night. And now historic hotel, Easton Court, in Chagford, Devon, is going on the market for £1.65million. The renowned writer had broken his leg while parachute training in the Second World War and was given unpaid leave. Author Evelyn Waugh checked into Easton Court, Devon, in January 1944 to start work on Brideshead Revisited, his most famous novel . So he checked into the peaceful hotel  on 31 January 1944 to start work on what would be his most famous novel. Mr Waugh wrote about the hotel being 'full of elderly women' who did not distract him from his work and explained how he would go on 'long and lonely walks'. He would also attend church in the village of Gidleigh and was at the hotel when he received the news of the birth of his fifth child. The writer said the hotel was 'something more than comfort' and added it had 'a tranquillity that makes it uniquely agreeable for both work and rest'. Evelyn Waugh completed Black Mischief in 1932, A Handful of Ashes in 1934 and started work on Brideshead Revisited at the peaceful hotel in Devon .

He said the eight-bedroom hotel was 'something more than comfort' and added it had 'a tranquillity that makes it uniquely agreeable for both work and rest' He explained how while at Easton Court he 'wrote with a zest that was quite strange' to him. The hotel was also visited by Patrick Leigh Fermor, who wrote The Traveller's Tree there, as well as CP Snow, John Steinbeck and poet John Betjeman. Emma Tallack, from estate agents Jackson-Stops, said: 'There has been plenty of people interested in the property because of its literary past.

"Gangs from coast to coast have toned down their use of colors and are even removing or altering tattoos to avoid being easily identified by police and witnesses, law enforcement officials have revealed. Nearly gone are the gang days of the 1980s and '90s, when the Bloods wore head-to-toe red, the Crips wore blue and Latin Kings wore black and gold. Today, the most you might see is part of a red handkerchief hanging out of a back pocket or a gold and black baseball cap, said Johnmichael O'Hare, a Hartford police sergeant who monitors gangs. In this September 5, 2014 photo, a reputed member of the Los Solidos street gang shows his tattoo to police in Hartford, Connecticut. Police said the tattoo of a theater mask with the words 'laugh now cry later' is a tell-tale sign of the street gang . A reputed member of the Los Solidos street gang shows his tattoos to police in Hartford, Connecticut earlier this month. The TSO and theater mask on his left arm are tell-tale signs of Los Solidos. TSO means The Solid Ones, the English translation of Los Solidos . 'Many of them don't wear colors. They tell us they're not in gangs,' O'Hare said. 'They're trying to avoid detection from law enforcement.' Gang members also don't want to stand out because they are committing more white-collar-type crimes, such as credit card and identity thefts, authorities say. 'If you want to go into Macys or Neiman Marcus and use a fraudulently obtained credit card and you have all these tattoos, it's more difficult,' said William Dunn, a Los Angeles police detective and author of the 2007 book, The Gangs of Los Angeles. Another impetus: laws passed in several states making it easier for police to target gangs. In Connecticut, officials can use racketeering laws once reserved for the mob to go after gangs. In Los Angeles, court injunctions allow police to enforce nighttime curfews and arrest people for hanging out in public and wearing gang colors. 'So we don't see so much wearing of the colors. We don't see so much of the tattooing,' Dunn said. When it comes to going to prison, gang members also don't want to be identified because they'll be placed in more restrictive conditions for security reasons, officials say. Wearing colors has long been a way for gang members to show solidarity, but the FBI says gang members are indeed shying away from displaying identifiers. Reputed members of the Los Solidos street gang are stopped by police in Hartford. Gang members are shying away from wearing their colors in an effort to avoid being detected by authorities, police said . Often the only time colors and other identifiers are now displayed is at gang functions and funerals, according to the FBI's 2013 National Gang report. While gangs are showing their colors less, they have given police another way to identify them - their use of Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites. 'Today they declare themselves gang members on the Internet,' O'Hare said. Still, he said, their detection-avoiding efforts on the street have made police officials' jobs a little harder. Hartford officers now have to get up close to identify gang members, he said. On a recent day, officers stopped a group of youths in commonplace T-shirts and shorts breaking a loitering law and made them all sit down. Making a statement: Bloods gang members gesturing their sign and wearing the typical head-to-toe red in 1993, Los Angeles, California (left) while taking part in a music video. Latin King Gang members outside the Federal Courthouse in New York City in support of a gang leader sentenced to life in prison in 1997 (right) O'Hare, interested in gathering information on gangs, got several of them to pull up their sleeves and pull down their shirt collars, revealing telltale tattoos of the Los Solidos gang — theater masks with the words 'laugh now cry later' and the letters TSO for The Solid Ones, the English translation of their group's name. Officers then let the youths go - but kept their names and suspected gang affiliations in the event of future encounters. In addition to well-established gangs like the Bloods and Latin Kings, police are dealing with smaller, neighborhood-based street gangs that can be just as violent and often wear no colors or tattoos at all, law enforcement officials say. The neighborhood gangs usually are friends who grew up together and claim several blocks as their territory, O'Hare said. One such neighborhood gang in Hartford, Money Green/Bedroc, often wore the kind of athletic jerseys popular among kids nationwide, according to a state grand jury report issued in December. The reputed leader, Donald Raynor, was arrested last year. Raynor, 29, is now on trial in state court in Hartford on a murder charge and awaits trial in five other cases involving attempted murder charges. Police say he led the particularly violent gang, which sold drugs and had 'hit squad' enforcers who were involved in shootings of rivals in 2007 and 2008. Raynor has pleaded not guilty in all the cases. Hartford police Sgt Johnmichael O'Hare shows officers the city's gunshot location program. The system uses microphones on the street to alert police to gunshots. It is part of a new plan to crack down on gang activity as members are shying away from wearing their colors in an effort to avoid being detected by authorities .

"A supporter of Scottish independence who died shortly before the referendum is set to take part in the vote anyway - because his family are placing a wreath in his memory outside a polling station.

When her father was dying, Ms Dunn reassured him that she would fight on his behalf. Poll: Mr McLean's family were heartbroken that he would be unable to cast his vote . 'I told him that he must look down on the celebrations with pride on the 19th,' she said. 'I told him his heart will be right there with me at the polling station. 'The wreath is his way of saying Yes on Thursday. It's so significant for me because that's my dad getting his final say. 'We're going to take it to the local polling station on Thursday. George, my eldest, is going to take it down. 'He can't put pen to paper but he can be there, right there, at the polls.

"NSW Premier Mike Baird announced his support for the clinical trial of medical marijuana on Tuesday . The legalisation of medical marijuana could become a reality sooner than expected in Australia as New South Wales becomes the second state after Victoria to support a clinical trial of the drug. On Tuesday the NSW government announced their support for the trial, and this will bring the legal use of cannabis and other forms of the drug for sufferers of chronic illness one step closer. Premier Mike Baird also declared his personal approval in parliament on Tuesday, and said he was moved by the story of 24-year-old Daniel Haslam, who has suffered with an agressive form of bowel cancer for the past four years. 'Why not take a stance to say to the rest of the country, this matters. It's time we did something about it,' Mr Baird told parliament, the ABC report. 'So I say at the same time, we want to give the terminally ill and those around them, their carers, their family, greater peace of mind. 'We also want to ensure that carers aren't forced to watch their loved ones suffer when their pain can be alleviated,' he continued. A working group has already been established, and will look at issues surrounding supply, distribution, before delivering a report at the end of this year. The government are also making the move to amend police guidelines so anyone found in possession of a small amount of marijuana who is on a register of terminally ill patients will not be charged. Labor has offered bipartisan support on the issue, and opposition leader John Robertson told the Sydney Morning Herald terminally ill people who wanted to use the drug for medicinal purposes: 'Should not suffer the further humiliation of being dragged through our courts and treated as criminals.' Scroll down for video . Mr Baird said he was moved by the plight of 24-year-old Daniel Haslam (left) whose mother Lucy (right) has been campaigning for the legalisation of the drug for those with chronic illness . Earlier this year before she addressed parliament about the issue Daily Mail Australia spoke to Lucy Haslam, Daniel's mother, about the relief that marijuana has brought to her son's life. Mrs Haslam, a retired nurse, and her husband Lou, a former police officer, have watched their son Daniel deteriorate from a fit and high achieving student to a frail and depressed young man. In a speech that Mrs Haslam delivered to Parliament House in Canberra in June, she detailed how her youngest son desperately clings to the hope and relief that illegal cannabis offers him. While Daniel continues his four year fight with cancer, the effects of chemotherapy have been detrimental. NSW Labor has provided bipartisan support for the trial and the the move to amend police guidlines so anyone found in possession of the drug who is on a register of terminally ill patients will not be charged . Cannabis provides solace for Daniel, unlike others such as antiemetic drugs which are supposed to relieve him from nausea and vomiting induced by cancer treatment. Mrs Haslam told ABC on Tuesday she was beside herself when she was notified of Mr Baird's decision. 'I think I gave him a big hug and a kiss. He's a very kind, caring man, you know he's a dad,' she said. 'I think he probably knows as any parent the horrible feeling of watching your child suffer and feeling powerless. He can empathise with that I think,' Mrs Haslam added. Mr Haslam has been suffering from bowel cancer for four years and has severe side effects from chemotherapy which cannabis helps to alleviate . Just last month the Victorian opposition leader Daniel Andrews said cannabis should be available for people who needed treatment in exceptional circumstances. Labor wants to legalise cannabis oil for the treatment of conditions such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, glaucoma and Parkinson's Disease. He said the same rules would not apply for recreational use. 'In some cases, parents are forced to choose between breaking the law and watching their child suffer,"" Mr Andrews said. 'Children are in pain, families are suffering, people are living in fear, and outdated laws are getting in the way.' The move follows public campaigns by Victorian families who have successfully treated their chronically ill children when other medicines have not worked.

"An extremist religious family with two small children have been rescued after being lost of sea for nearly three months when they attempted to abandon the U.S. in a small boat and sail 3,300 miles to the Polynesian island nation of Kiribati. The Gastonguays from northern Arizona set sail from San Diego in May with their newborn infant and 3-year-old daughter after deciding to 'take a leap of faith and see where God led us.' They believed that they needed to flee the nation because of what they see as government support for homosexuality and abortions and restrictions on their religious freedom. The family were almost immediately beset by storms that overwhelmed their small vessel and their limited nautical knowledge. They drifted for months and were running law on supplies before they were picked up by a passing tanker. On Friday the family landed in Chile and are expected to be flow home today on flights book by the U.S. State Department. Rescued: Hannah Gastonguay, her baby Rahab, husband Sean and the couple's 3-year-old daughter Ardith, were lost at sea for nearly three months . The months-long journey has been 'pretty exciting' and 'little scary at certain points,' 26-year-old Hannah Gastonguay told The Associated Press by telephone on Saturday. She said they wanted to go to Kiribati because 'we didn't want to go anywhere big.' She said they believed the island to be 'one of the least developed countries in the world.' Kiribati is a group of islands just off the equator and the international date line about halfway between Hawaii and Australia - more than 3,000 miles from the U.S. coastline. The total population is just over 100,000 people of primarily Micronesian descent. The nation has a long history with missionaries and is 96percent Christian. It has a higher Human Development Index than South Africa or India. Hannah Gastonguay said her family was fed up with government control in the U.S. As Christians they don't believe in 'abortion, homosexuality, in the state-controlled church,' she said. 'We were in the thick of it, but we prayed. Being out on that boat, I just knew I was going to see some miracles.' Hannah Gastonguay, 26, on being lost at sea with her two children . U.S. 'churches aren't their own,' Gastonguay said, suggesting that government regulation interfered with religious independence. Among other differences, she said they had a problem with being 'forced to pay these taxes that pay for abortions we don't agree with.' The Gastonguays weren't members of any church, and Hannah Gastonguay said their faith came from reading the Bible and through prayer. 'The Bible is pretty clear,' she said. The family moved in November from Ash Fork, Arizona, to San Diego, where they lived on their boat as they prepared to set sail. She said she gave birth to the couple's 8-month-old girl on the boat, which was docked in a slip at the time. In May, Hannah, her 30-year-old husband Sean, his father Mike, and the couple's daughters, 3-year-old Ardith and baby Rahab set off. They wouldn't touch land again for 91 days, she said. Across the sea: This is the remarkable journey of the Gastonguay family, who put to sea in May and is returning home on Sunday . She said at first, 'We were cruising.' But within a couple of weeks 'when we came out there, storm, storm, storm.' The boat had taken a beating, and they decided to set course for the Marquesas Islands. Instead, they found themselves in a 'twilight zone,' taking more and more damage, leaving them unable to make progress. They could have used a sail called a genoa, she said, but they risked snapping off the mast and losing their radio and ability to communicate. 'They were looking for a kind of adventure; they wanted to live on a Polynesian island but they didn't have sufficient expertise to navigate adequately.' Chilean police prefect Jose Luis Lope . They had been on the ocean for about two months and were low on supplies. They were out of food and were down to 'some juice and some honey.' She said they were able to catch fish, but they didn't see any boats. Still, we 'didn't feel like we were going to die or anything. We believed God would see us through,' she said. At one point a fishing ship came into contact with them but left without providing assistance. A Canadian cargo ship came along and offered supplies, but when they pulled up alongside it, the vessels bumped and the smaller ship sustained even more damage. They were getting hit by 'squall after, squall, after squall.' 'We were in the thick of it, but we prayed,' she said. 'Being out on that boat, I just knew I was going to see some miracles.' They watched the surrounding storms disperse, and 'next thing you know the sun is out. It's amazing.' Rescued: Sean Gastonguay, seen here with his 3-year-old daughter Ardit, is lucky to be alive after being rescued by a Venezuelan tanker and a Japanese freighter . Eventually, their boat was spotted by a helicopter that had taken off from a nearby Venezuelan fishing vessel, which ended up saving them. 'The captain said, ""Do you know where you're at? You're in the middle of nowhere,""' she said. They were on the Venezuelan ship for about five days before transferring to the Japanese cargo ship, where they were for nearly three weeks before landing in Chile on Friday. The Chilean newspaper Las Ultimas Noticias reported the story of their arrival. 'They were looking for a kind of adventure; they wanted to live on a Polynesian island but they didn't have sufficient expertise to navigate adequately,' police prefect Jose Luis Lopez, who took the family's statement at San Antonio, told the newspaper. Sean Gastonguay's brother Jimmy, who lives in Arizona, said he had provided a description of the family's vessel to the U.S. Coast Guard and exchanged emails with them once they were picked up by the first boat. 'There was some concern, but we were hoping for the best, and they eventually popped up,' he said. He was able to keep track of the family with the help of the Coast Guard as they were transferred from ship to ship. 'We're all happy. We have good peace of mind now,' he said. Hannah Gastonguay said the family will now 'go back to Arizona' and 'come up with a new plan.'","Gastonguay family left northern Arizona home in November to live on a boat in San Diego .

"Marine: Antoine Davis, 30, served as a marine in Iraq according to his ex-wife Tamaira Chesley . A former marine shot and killed his girlfriend before turning the gun on himself after a standoff in an Atlanta suburb with SWAT officers that lasted 12 hours, police say. Jessica Arrendale, 33, was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head along with Antoine Davis, 30, who police believe shot himself and Arrendale in a murder-suicide. Police found the couple's five-month-old infant safe inside and rushed her to the hospital to treat her for hypothermia. Officers arrived at the home in Smyrna in the early morning hours Sunday, responding to a call that there was someone in the home armed with a gun. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that police evacuated nearby homes as a precaution and attempted to make contact with the armed man inside. When officers made the decision to breach the doors around 1:30 p.m., they found the bodies of Arrendale and Davis, both killed by gunshot wounds to the head, Davis's reportedly self-inflicted. Shot down: Police say they entered the Smyrna townhouse around 1:30 p.m. but by then Jessica Arrendale, 33, was already killed . In addition to the couple's five-month-old, Fox 5 reports that Davis's two daughters from a previous marriage, ages 9 and 10, were in the home. Their mother, Tamaira Chesley, described how one daughter later told her that Davis stared at her for a 'very long time' before she asked him, 'Daddy, what are you doing?' Chesley says Davis then went upstairs with a gun and the daughter heard Arrendale screaming and then a 'boom.' 'I'm not sure where his depression came from,' Chesley says, but says there was a custody battle over the five-month-old daughter. Leslie Tidwell, a friend of Arrendale's, set up a GoFundMe page for her two children, writing on it that 'Jessica was the sole provider for her household.' Father: Davis's ex-wife Tamaira Chesley described Davis in kind terms, saying that lately he had been struggling with depression and mentioning a custody dispute he had with Arrendale . Lost: A GoFundMe page was set up for Arrendale to provide for her two daughters after her death, saying Arrendale was the sole provider . Arrendale's family did not give a statement, only telling Fox 5 they 'wished to grieve and surround ourselves with loved ones.' Davis and Arrendale's five-month-old is currently in custody of the Division of Family and Children Services.","Antoine Davis, 30, is believed to have shot his girlfriend, Jessica Arrendale, 33, before turning the gun on himself .

"One out of every eight albums sold worldwide is made by a British pop star – bringing billions into the country every year, figures revealed today. Britain’s music industry grew 9 per cent last year adding £3.8 billion to the economy, according to the trade body, UK Music. Global album sales, live concerts and cash made by song writing now support 111,000 full-time jobs in the country. Scroll down for video . Pop superstars Ellie Goulding (left) and Adele (right) are leading a boom in British music around the world . UK Music chief Jo Dipple said British pop industry now raised more money in taxes for the Government than the UK car industry. Ms Dipple said: ‘The young, bearded kids in the pub, making a racket on a Friday night, might just turn out to generate more revenue for Her Majesty’s Treasury than a car manufacturer. But they need support to get there.’ British stars from Adele to Ellie Goulding are selling out concerts worldwide with albums topping the charts across Europe and the States. Ms Dipple said everyone knew British music was world class – but claimed today’s report was the first time the industry could ‘put a figure to its value’. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said the music industry was one of the UK economy's biggest successes . She said: ‘Last year its contribution to our economy grew by 9 per cent. This is a big deal. We lead the world in song writing, composing, production, recordings and live performances. ‘You only have to glance at the 2014 Mercury nominees to understand what an eclectic, unique and world-leading bunch of musicians work in this country.’ Culture Minister, Sajid Javid added: ‘The UK Music industry is one of our biggest success stories. 'Not only does it make a tremendous contribution to driving economic growth, but it plays a pivotal role in taking British culture to every corner of the globe. ‘One in every eight albums sold anywhere in the world is by a British artist, and I know that, with the ongoing support from Government, this dynamic sector will continue to flourish and thrive.’ But Ms Dipple claimed the Government needed to do more to protect copyright and educate young people about paying for music and the problems of piracy. UK Music also called for Google and other web giants to give priority to licensed, online music services in search results and urged better access to bank finance for small music businesses. Ms Dipple said UK Music wanted to help government ‘develop policies as good as the music we produce’.","UK music industry grew 9% last year adding £3.8 billion to the economy .

"A Sudanese mother who was sentenced to death for marrying a Christian has told of how her captors repeatedly tried to convert her to Islam. Meriam Ibrahim, 27, was pregnant with her second child when she was sentenced to hang for apostasy by Sudan's courts under Sharia law. She was shackled to the floor of a women's prison in Khartoum, where she gave birth to her daughter Maya while her 21-month-old son Martin was by her side. Scroll down for video . Meriam Ibrahim, 27, was pregnant with her second child when she was sentenced to hang for apostasy  under Sharia law. Above, she is pictured holding her newborn daughter Maya while sat next to her toddler son Martin . Speaking out: Ibrahim told Fox News how her captors placed her under 'tremendous pressure' to renounce her religion by reciting parts of the Koran. She said: 'My faith was the only weapon I had in these confrontations' She was finally freed in in late June following an international outcry and was helped to travel to the U.S., where her husband Daniel Wani had citizenship. Now, Ibrahim has revealed how her captors placed her under 'tremendous pressure' to renounce her religion by reciting parts of the Koran. She said she was visited every day by imams from the Muslim Scholars Association, who read sections of the religious text to her in a bid to encourage her to convert to Islam. 'These were imams that created an intervention by reciting parts of the Koran for me. I faced a tremendous amount of pressure,' she told Fox News. Husband and wife: Ibrahim was arrested in August last year and in May, was sentenced to hanging and 100 lashes for adultery and apostasy for marrying Daniel Wani. Above, the couple are pictured on their wedding day . Horrific treatment: Ibrahim was shackled to the floor of a women's prison in Khartoum, where she gave birth to her daughter Maya (left). Right, she is seen leaving Italy for New Hampshire following her lengthy ordeal . 'I had my trust in God. My faith was the only weapon that I had in these confrontations with imams and Muslim scholars, because that's what I believe.' Ibrahim, whose mother was an Ethiopian Christian and father was a Muslim who abandoned the family when she was young, insisted she was raised a Christian 'from the start'. She said that she was forced to give birth to her daughter without medical treatment and with chains on her ankles, but added: 'I was sure God would stand by my side'. When asked why she didn't convert to Islam to escape her horrific situation, she replied: 'If I did, that would mean I gave up.' In June 23, Ibrahim was released from prison, but less than 24 hours later, she and her husband were arrested at a Sudanese airport as they sought to leave the country. Above, the family are seen following the re-arrest . Ibrahim was arrested in August last year and in May, was sentenced to hanging and 100 lashes for adultery and apostasy for marrying Mr Wani. Because her father was a Muslim, a strict Islamic judge said she had broken the law and must die. In June 23, she was released from prison, but less than 24 hours later, she and her husband were arrested at a Sudanese airport as they sought to leave the country with their two children. Last month, Ibrahim finally arrived in New Hampshire to start a new life with Mr Wani, a Christian from South Sudan, after her death sentenced was overturned.

At the time, her friend Maria Ajang said: 'She was so happy. She said: 'I'm so happy to see you guys here. I was crying and she told me don't cry, I'm here.' Meanwhile, Mr Wani sobbed uncontrollably and said: 'It's good to be home. There's a sense of relief.

"The woman whose eight-month-old baby boy may have lain next to the body for 'several days' was 'not depressed' according to people who knew her. The woman had given birth to the boy while the baby's father was in jail, Daily Mail Australia has been told, but the mother who was in her thirties was 'very happy, very positive and loved being a mother'. Police are contacting relatives of the little boy, who was in critical condition when officers entered the fibro Department of Housing dwelling in Wollongong, south of Sydney, on Tuesday and found the infant with the body of his dead mother.

"BBC bosses were accused of a ‘cop out’ last night when, hours after attacking the campaign to get Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead to number one, they decided to play it anyway. The corporation confirmed it would play a ‘brief excerpt’ of the song during tomorrow’s chart show, prompting claims the broadcaster is being ‘manipulated by anarchists’. The decision means that, less than a week after the death of Baroness Thatcher, Britain’s greatest peacetime prime minister, the words ‘the witch is dead’ may be broadcast on Radio 1. Scroll down for video . Climbing up the charts: The Wizard Of Oz track which has had a surge of popularity in the wake of Baroness Thatcher's death is on course for a place in the top five . Online push: A message running on the Facebook group which has been set up to push the song in this week's chart . Allies of Lady Thatcher branded the . plans ‘utterly disrespectful’, and claimed they had handed a propaganda . victory to left-wing agitators who have propelled the song, from The . Wizard Of Oz, towards the top of the charts. Tory MPs branded the decision to play . ‘up to five seconds’ of the song a ‘cop out’ by the new BBC director . general Lord Hall and BBC executives. Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead reached . number three in the official chart yesterday and last night required . only 5,000 more sales to take second place. It was already number one in . the iTunes chart. After hours of private talks, the BBC . said the Radio 1 chart show would contain a ‘news item’ explaining why . the song was in the charts and that a short clip of the song would be . played. Facing the first crisis of his . leadership, Lord Hall issued a statement saying he did not believe the . song should be banned. He said: ‘I understand the concerns about this . campaign. I personally believe it is distasteful and inappropriate. The BBC will nplay the 1939 tune during Radio 1's top 40 countdown, hosted by Jameela Jamil, left.  It is still some distance behind the week’s biggest selling single, Need U (100%) by Duke Dumont , right, FT A*M*E . Place in the charts: The song is the shortest top 10 single ever, with the most popular version running to 51 seconds . ‘However I do believe it would be . wrong to ban the song outright as free speech is an important principle . and a ban would only give it more publicity.’ Lord Hall held a series of . conversations with Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper and director of radio . Graham Ellis about how to deal with the growing storm. But Mr Cooper . told Radio 4’s PM programme that it had been his decision to air the . clip, not Lord Hall’s. The power of a Facebook campaign should not be underestimated. In 2009 a Facebook campaign was designed to prevent another X Factor number one. As a consequence Rock band Rage Against the Machine won the most competitive battle in years for the Christmas number one. The . band's single, Killing In The Name, sold 500,000 downloads beating X . Factor winner Joe McElderry's The Climb by 50,000 copies to clinch the . top spot. In a blog posted on the BBC’s website, . Mr Cooper wrote: ‘I find the campaign to promote the song in response . to the death of Baroness Thatcher as distasteful as anyone.’ He . acknowledged there was ‘understandable anger’ from people who were . ‘appalled by this campaign’. But he said the chart show could not . ‘ignore a high new entry which clearly reflects the views of a big . enough portion of the record-buying public to propel it up the charts’. Mr Cooper added: ‘To ban the record . from our airwaves completely would risk giving the campaign the oxygen . of further publicity and might inflame an already delicate situation.’ The BBC would not confirm exactly what . part of the song would be aired tomorrow, but most of the lyrics . contain the offensive phrase. Mr Cooper said the station was ‘still making a decision’ on whether to include the actual words in the clip it chooses. But the BBC’s explanation did not satisfy many Tory MPs. Thatcherite former defence minister . Sir Gerald Howarth told the Mail: ‘A lot of people will feel this . decision is a cop-out. The BBC used to have a charter requiring it to . observe taste and decency. The director general himself has said this . song is tasteless. Do they not now believe in taste and decency? ‘It is utterly disrespectful to play . this song when Margaret Thatcher put her life on the line for her . country and came within inches of death at Brighton in 1984. ‘Playing this song, even a part of it, . will play into the hands of the politically-inspired campaign by Trots . and the Socialist Worker Party who have never forgiven Margaret Thatcher . for destroying socialism.’ New director general Tony Hall defended playing the clip, saying: 'I do believe it would be wrong to ban the song outright as free speech is an important principle and a ban would only give it more publicity' Tory MP Andrew Rosindell added: ‘We have broadcasting rules which prevent the playing of songs which project hatred. ‘This song is being used to project hatred at a time of national mourning – it’s the same thing.’ Philip Davies, a Conservative member of the Commons culture select committee, had argued for the whole song to be played. But he contrasted the ‘typical BBC . fudge’ with Lady Thatcher’s leadership style. ‘It’s definitely true that . Mrs Thatcher would never have fudged a decision in the way the BBC has, . which is probably why she didn’t have a great deal of time for the . BBC.’ Tory MP Mark Pritchard said: ‘I am . surprised they are prepared to be manipulated so readily by the agenda . of anarchists and the hard left.’ But even before the decision on the . chart show was reached yesterday, Radio 2 had already broadcast a . 15-second clip of the song during a discussion on the Jeremy Vine Show, . presented by Jane Garvey. A spokesman for Radio 2 said: ‘In . order to fully illustrate the subject for listeners a short clip of the . song was played as part of a reasoned debate around the topic.’ But former Radio 1 DJ Mike Read, an . admirer of Lady Thatcher, said the BBC should play the song – because . the former Prime Minister was  ‘tough enough’ not to have cared.

"A high school student has been suspended for dealing  out of his locker. But this teenager was not handling drugs or shifting stolen goods - he was selling Pepsi. Grade 12 student Keenan Shaw, 17,  was handed a two-day suspension from Winston Churchill High School in Lethbridge, Alberta, last week, after he was found to be selling the soda at a profit form his school locker. The budding businessman was told that the sales violated the school's nutrition and marketing policies and that he was operating a business without a licence, the Calgary Sun reported. Under the school board's Healthy Nutritional Choices Policy, sugary sodas are not allowed in the schools. Diet versions, on the other hand, are permitted. Grade 12 student Keenan Shaw, 17, was handed a two-day suspension from Winston Churchill High School in Lethbridge, Alberta, for selling Pepsi to fellow students at a profit out of his school locker . Keenan noted that compared to what other students have been known to sell at the high school, his own transgressions were in fact minor. 'I'm not going to name any names, but I know a couple of people selling marijuana, he said. 'There's kids selling smokes, there was a kid last year selling meth, as well as a kid selling acid.' The student has been told that he will be expelled from the school should he continue to sell the bootleg soda. Keenan's mother, Alyssa Shaw-Letourneau, claimed that  the school's punishment for her son is too extreme. 'From a business perspective, what he did was actually very smart, and if you look at [it] from the perspective of profit, 140 per cent is pretty good,' she said. Cheryl Gilmore, superintendent of the Lethbridge public school board, yesterday said she could not speak about the individual student's case, CBC News reported. But she explained that the school rules state that a principal has to be consulted before an item can be sold on school property. 'We can't just have anyone coming into the school selling anything they want in the school,' she said. 'There's a distribution of merchandise policy, but we would never suspend someone. We would talk to them about it, we would talk to them about why it doesn't follow our nutrition policy. 'So there would be lots of talk and fair warning, and opportunity to work with the school administration, before it would ever get to the point of a suspension.' Although selling a Pepsi isn't enough for a suspension, Gilmore said 'persistent or chronic disobedience or disregard for district or school rules' is sufficient grounds. Keenan now says that he's learned his lesson - although it might not be the one the school intended for him. 'I've learned a lot about business and authority as well as supply and demand, as well as how location ties into all these factors,' he said. The student has now shifted his fledgling business outside to the sidewalk. 'I can walk out to the sidewalk, make the trade off, and walk back into the school,' Shaw said, noting that he'd sold a couple cans by finding that 'little loophole.'","Grade 12 student Keenan Shaw, 17, was handed a two-day suspension .

"Hundreds of young Dutch men and women turned Amsterdam's central Dam square into a blizzard of red goop, as they pelted each other mercilessly with overripe tomatoes. The event was set up as a protest against Russian sanctions blocking imports of European fresh produce. However, most participants turned out to experience the joy of smacking a loved one - or total stranger - with tomato pulp at close range. Camaraderie: Dozens of participants pose for the camera with red tomato goop dripping from their clothes . The idea was taken from Spain's famed annual La Tomatina festival in Bunol. Participant Lois Bloedjes said: 'It was hard in there. It was mean. But it was fun . 'Everything became one big pile of mush. There were people swimming in it on the ground.' Her sister Sil described the smell in the mush pit as 'awful' and 'somewhat like beer,' but the tomatoes that actually got in her mouth - 'the taste was actually not bad.' All out war: Hundreds of people threw tomatoes at loved ones and strangers during the food fight extravaganza . Tickets to the one-hour fight on Sunday cost 15 euros (£12) each and around 1,000 were sold. Organiser Joep Verbunt said proceeds will go to tomato growers hurt by the sanctions. The Netherlands vies with Mexico as the world's largest tomato exporter, and it sent £80million worth to Russia last year. Dutch farmers have been offered a subsidy to either dispose of excess crops or donate them to food banks. Verbunt purchased 120,000 tomatoes labeled unfit for human consumption for the event. Down and out: A man and a woman on the ground were the primary targets for these rowdy participants . Tomato shower: This exuberant participant enjoyed getting his first tomato shower during the event . With music pumping from a podium, the participants - most of whom were wearing white before the fight started - counted down from 10 to zero. Then a shipping container full of the fruit was emptied into the arena. The area was fenced off to prevent casual passers-by from being hit - but many tried to climb the fences or peer inside to see what was happening. The leftover tomato sludge will be cleaned and sent to a biogas production facility. Unbridled chaos: The free-for-all tomato fight proved to be a popular attraction in Amsterdam on Sunday . 'It was beautiful,' said participant Dennis de Jong, who exited the arena with tomato chunks in his hair, down his pants, and even a few bits stinging his eyes where they had seeped in past the swimming goggles he wore for protection. 'They have to do this every year.' The idea for the tomato fight was initiated following the Russian boycott of EU agriculture products which has adversely affected many tomato growers in the Netherlands. Organiser Joep Verbunt says the event was a collaborative effort to provide support to hard-pressed farmers who are struggling financially.","Food fight took inspiration from La Tomantina festival near Valencia .

"Hundreds of Scottish nationalists renewed their attack on the BBC at a rally in Glasgow tonight. Up to 500 independence supporters gathered in the city's George Square two days ahead of the historic referendum set to take place on Thursday. The crowds repeatedly chanted 'BBC, shame on you' as a series of speakers delivered arguments in favour of independence. Rally: Hundreds of people gathered in Glasgow to show support for Scottish independence . Chaotic: Protesters spoke out in favour of breaking up the UK at the event ahead of Thursday's referendum . The rally comes shortly after a group of up to 1,000 protesters marched on the headquarters of BBC Scotland, accusing the Corporation of bias in its referendum coverage. Anger has particularly focused on the BBC's political editor Nick Robinson, who clashed with Alex Salmond in a fiery interview last week. At this evening's event, the Yes supporters chanted 'Where's the cameras, BBC?' and 'You can shove your TV licence up your a***.' The crowds, which also sang 500 Miles by the Scottish band the Proclaimers and several renditions of Flower of Scotland, gathered around 6pm and had largely dispersed within an hour and a half. Speakers included comedian Hardeep Singh Kohli and Deacon Blue's lead singer Ricky Ross. Warning: The event's organiser asked supporters to ensure that it passed off peacefully . Passion: The Yes campaign has long been much more vocal than opponents of independence . Carnival: One woman paints a saltire on the face of another at the rally in George Square . Prior to the event, organiser Martin Compston, an actor who starred in Monarch of the Glen, pleaded for calm after a series of unpleasant attacks on anti-independence politicians and campaigners by nationalist supporters. Speaking at the event, Mr Compston said: 'I wanted to get people together, one thing I want to stress is this is not a celebration yet but it's about invigorating people. 'I felt that it was being portrayed that the Yes campaign was quite negative so I was keen for people to come together and show how positive it is.' Supporter Josephine Howe, 54, said she would vote for independence despite being a lifelong Labour voter. Entertainment: A bagpipes player was one of several musicians to play during the gathering . All smiles: Fans of independence attempted to dispel the image of intimidation associated with the Yes side . 'I wanted to take part and show my solidarity with other voters,' she said. 'The amount of people getting involved in politics again has been great, my 16-year-old granddaughter knows more about politics than I do and she can't wait to vote. 'I was Labour all my life and so was my dad and my grandfather but so many supporters just don't trust then anymore and they want a change, and the SNP have done a good job of making their case.' Banners at Sunday's demonstration described the BBC as the 'British Biased Corporation', with one placard saying the corporation was 'anti-democracy, anti-truth'. Anger: Several of those attending the event said they felt let down by the Labour party . Flag-waving: Many of those attending had saltire flags and other campaign paraphernalia . The event raised alarm among some campaigners, who have suggested that the Yes campaign is using intimidatory tactics to suppress opposition. Mr Robinson was accused of 'heckling' Mr Salmond at a press conference last week as he repeatedly pushed the First Minister to explain the economic consequences of Scottish independence. The fiery exchange came after the BBC reported that Royal Bank of Scotland was set to move its headquarters to London, quoting anonymous Government sources. Asked by the Sunday Herald whether he thought the BBC was biased, Mr Salmond said: 'Yes, absolutely. Of course it is. 'The problem with Nick... I mean, don't get me wrong, I like these folk, but they don't realise they're biased. It's the unconscious bias which is the most extraordinary thing of all.'","Independence supporters showed their anger with BBC's alleged bias .

"A New Jersey father is outraged after officials at his daughter's school accidentally released the child to a complete stranger last week. Gemar Mills, 31, from Paterson, says staff at Dale Avenue School put the life of his 3-year-old daughter, Madison, at risk by allowing her to go home with a woman who mistook the toddler for her granddaughter. The grandmother had not seen her granddaughter for nine months when she went to the Paterson school last week to pick up the girl, also named Madison. Scroll down for video . Reunited: Gemar Mills, 31, hugs his daughter, Madison, who last week went missing for 30 minutes after her school allowed another student's grandmother to take her home . Explanation: The administration of Dale Avenue School said the mix-up occurred because the grandmother had not seeing her granddaughter for nine months, and the child was also named Madison . Two staff members at the pre-K school signed off on the toddler’s release and sent her home with the woman, who reportedly kissed and hugged Madison, according to The Paterson Press. It was not until the 3-year-old arrived home that the mix-up became apparent and Madison Mills was promptly returned back to the school. But according to Gemar Mills, his 3-year-old, who suffers from a peanut allergy, could have died in the time it took the other family to bring the child back. ‘The grandmother said, “I took her to the store and I gave her a granola bar,""’ Mills told NBC New York. ‘Well, she has a peanut allergy, so it was a miracle she didn't eat the peanut version.’ Officials at Dale Avenue School realized that Madison Mills was sent home with the wrong person when her mother called the school to say she was coming to pick up the toddler, but was told that the girl already had been picked up by someone else. 'Within minutes, the school principal realized the mistake and she worked quickly to ensure the child was returned safely to the school, which she was (within 30 minutes). Our head of security was notified, and so was the child's mother.' school spokeswoman Terry Corallo said in a statement. Close call: Mr Mills said the woman who picked up his daughter, who suffers from a peanut allergy, bought her a granola bar, which luckily did not contain nuts . Mr Mills, who himself is a school principal at Malcolm X Shabazz High School in Newark, said his young daughter was left shaken by the incident. Furious: Mills, who works as a school principal, said officials at his daughter's school were negligent . ‘She keeps telling me, “I went to the lady's house and then the man yelled out, 'That's not our baby, bring her back,’’ he said. ‘She remembers that stuff.’ Gemar Mills added that little Madison is now afraid to go back to school because she does not want to end up with the other family. According to the father, officials at the Paterson school, which has some 340 students from pre-K to second grade, failed to contact police to report his daughter missing in violation of their own policy, and then contacted the grandmother instead of calling him or his wife first, 7Online reported. ‘How can we trust that they're going to keep any child safe?’ he wondered. The school administration has suspended a security guard and a teaching assistant without pay for allowing letting Madison Mills go home with a stranger. In the aftermath of the mix-up, the school now requires adults to show identification before picking up a child. Mr Mills has reported the incident to child protective services and contacted an attorney. Meanwhile, the school district has hired an investigator look into the matter.","Gemar Mills says his daughter, Madison, could have died had the woman given her peanuts .

"The taboo that sometimes still surrounds the subject of breastfeeding in public can leave many new mums feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable. While there are many places that happily accept that a nursing mother needs to feed her child when out and about, plenty of new mums still feel judged when doing so in public. One woman who wants to help stamp out those feelings is fertility expert and author Emma Cannon, who has opened her doors to new mums who want a cuppa while feeding their child and perhaps a little advice too. Feeling comfortable: A new breastfeeding cafe will open in Chelsea, London and provide breastfeeding advice for new mums . Emma has launched a drop in 'cafe' service in London so these mums can receive midwifery help and breastfeeding advice in a welcoming atmosphere. Emma says, 'I breast fed both my children for over a year and personally I never experienced any problems and was never made to feel uncomfortable, but I do think it depends on the individual. 'Although I was always discrete I equally was more concerned with the needs of my babies than with other people's prejudice. But I do know that not everyone feels this way, which is why I want to help women it they want to breastfeed.' Breast is best: The breastfeeding cafe will help support mums and treat any underlying difficulties that they may have . The idea of the cafe is that new mums can share advice and tea as well as benefiting from qualified medical care. Emma added: 'If they don't feel like breastfeeding and they just want advice about feeding then that is ok too-we can support new mums in whatever way feels right to them. 'The purpose of the cafe is not to hide women away, it is to give them a place to get good advice'. Time for tea: Fertility expert and author Emma Cannon, pictured, has launched a drop in service where mums can feel relaxed and welcome . From September the cafe, which will cost £175 for a six month membership, will be able to support and help mums as well as treat the underlying reasons behind any difficulties experienced. Unlike many other breastfeeding facilities and courses out there, where the post-natal attention is mainly based on the baby, Emma says her clinic concentrates on the mother's needs and goes by the motto 'nourish the mother to nourish the child.' Emma says: 'At my clinic, the Fertility Rooms, from where I have launched the breastfeeding cafe, we take an integrated approach. 'That means women don't just get advice on traditional methods of breastfeeding, but they get advice on foods, which improve milk supplies. 'They can also benefit from acupuncture if need be to help with mastitis, lack of milk supplies and any other minor ailment. We teach women that by looking after themselves, they are able to look after their baby.' Feeling relaxed: The breastfeeding cafe also provides acupuncture, nutritional support and traditional remedies to help restore a mother's energy . Midwife Anna Cannon says: 'During the early days it can be overwhelming adjusting to motherhood and recovering from the birth. Sometimes the early challenges of breastfeeding and understanding your baby's feeding cues can be very confusing. 'We can advise on correct position and attachment, managing wind and colic, how to increase milk supply, feeding plans, prevention and treatment of sore nipples, mastitis or engorgement. 'We can also help with identification of tongue tie and referral for treatment and advice on conditions such as thrush if necessary'. Emma adds: 'I like nothing better than to see a mother feeding her baby when I know the difficult journey she went on to become a mother and how much she longed for that baby.' The Breastfeeding Cafe is held every Thursday from 10am-2pm in Chelsea, London.","Fertility expert and author Emma Cannon has launched a drop-in service .

"A new study looking into the cannabis use of almost 4000 teenagers across Australia and New Zealand has revealed the drug has a high chance of causing adverse problems in users' adult life. The report, which was published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal, assessed the data from three long running studies by looking at five different levels of cannabis user patterns in children aged under 17 - never, less than monthly, monthly or more, weekly or more, and daily. Dr Edmund Silins, the lead author of the study, described the findings as 'startling' and said that although daily users recorded the most adverse conclusions, 'there was a sliding scale of effects'. The study analysed data from three long running studies of almost 4000 teenagers aged under 17 across Australia and New Zealand . 'There was a clear dose response effect which means the more frequently they used it, the more likely they were to experience a range of harm in adult hood,' Dr Silins told Daily Mail Australia. 'For daily users, by the age of 25, they were over 60 percent less likely to have completed high school or to have obtained a degree and seven times more likely to attempt suicide.' 'They are 18 times more likely to be cannabis dependant and eight times as likely to use other illicit drugs.' 'The risks of those outcomes were still there for people who smoked less frequently, but they were reduced.' Researchers also found that the risks still remained even after they took a wide range of confounding factors into account. Daily smokers were 60 percent less likely to have completed high school or to have obtained a degree and seven times more likely to attempt suicide by the age of 25 . 'We were able to include in the analysis, 53 other factors which might explain the association which we observed. They were things like socio-economic status, gender, parental mental health and drug use and peer drug use,' Dr Silins said. 'We found that even after taking those factors into account, the associations still held up.' Dr Silins said the findings have implications for both prevention and government policy on cannabis. Daily smokers were also 18 times more likely to be cannabis dependant and eight times as likely to use other illicit drugs by their mid 20s . He said finding a way to prevent or delay the sue of cannabis in young adults would have enormous health and social benefits and that policy makers need to evaluate and be aware of the harms associated with the drug as law reforms take place. 'The findings are relevant given the movement in some countries to decriminalise or legalise cannabis raising a possibility that cannabis might become more accessible to young people,' the report states. The report was completed in association with the Cannabis Cohort Research Consortium which was 'formed in order to be able to address important questions around cannabis use and make more efficient use of existing data that had already been collected,' Mr Silins said.","The study analysed data from three long running studies of almost 4000 teenagers aged under 17 across Australia and New Zealand .

"The Los Angeles police officer who detained Django Unchained actress Daniele Watts has spoken out to defend his actions and said he never suspected her of being a prostitute - despite her claims otherwise. Sergeant Jim Parker told the Los Angeles Times that he never intended to arrest Watts or her boyfriend Brian James Lucas when he was called to an LA studio parking lot for a report of two people have sex in a car. 'I figured I could take care of this call and go get coffee and that was it,' Sgt Parker told the newspaper. Scroll down for video . Sgt Jim Parker (not pictured) defended his actions when he detained Daniele Watts (right) because she wouldn't give him her identification. He claims she turned the incident into a 'long, drawn-out drama' Watts has defended her decision not to hand over her identification and says she was harassed by the LAPD and that she had done nothing wrong . Instead, he says, Watts turned it into a 'long, drawn-out drama.' Watts says she was accused of being a prostitute and targeted because she is black and her boyfriend is white. Witnesses told TMZ that they watched Watts and her boyfriend having sex in their car with the door open. They watched her get out and wipe herself with a tissue then throw it on the ground, according to the gossip site. Watts maintains she was merely making out with him. She was handcuffed and detained after she refused to show the officer her identification and tried to walk away. 'I was trying to ID them and leave. Nobody wanted them arrested for having sex in public,' Sgt Parker told the Times. 'But then she went into her tirade.' Miss Watts told CNN that she stands by her decision not handing over her ID. 'I believe what this country stands for and I believe in freedom and I believe in a country that calls itself the land of the free and the home of the brave,' she said on Monday. 'If I am within my amendment rights, my constitutional rights to say no, unless you're charging me with a crime, I will not be giving you my ID, that is a right that I stand up for.' California law allows police to handcuff and detain people in order to identify them. The LAPD says it is conducting a review of the incident. The department is also investigating a complain Miss Watts file against Sgt Parker. A recording of the encounter, obtained by the TMZ and the Times, shows Parker explaining: 'Somebody called, which gives me the right to be here, so it gives me the right to identify you by law.' Watts responds: 'Do you know how many times I’ve been called, the cops have been called just for being black? Just because we’re black and he’s white? I’m just being really honest, sir.'

"The fate of the United Kingdom is in the balance, with tomorrow’s Scottish independence referendum still on a knife-edge, an exclusive poll reveals. With only 24 hours to go in the increasingly rancorous campaign, the No side has a four-point lead – on 52 per cent compared with 48 per cent for Yes. But the Survation survey for the Daily Mail suggests that the separatists are closing the gap – and that the outcome now depends on around 350,000 voters who have still to make up their minds. Scroll down for video . It also indicates that Labour is again haemorrhaging support to Yes, with a third of those who voted for the party in the 2011 Scottish elections intending to back independence. The three pro-Union parties were yesterday engaged in a last-minute whirlwind of campaign visits as they seek to shore up the No vote. Writing in today’s Scottish Daily Mail, Better Together leader Alistair Darling warns: ‘I’m not exaggerating when I say Thursday is probably the most important day of our democratic lives. ‘From 7am until 10pm, Scotland and the UK will be in limbo, and everything which we have built over these last three centuries will hang in the balance.’ David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg yesterday signed a ‘vow’ to hand Edinburgh more powers if the Scots choose to stay – and promised to preserve the controversial funding formula which guarantees Scotland more public cash. Alistair Darling, who has warned that Thursday is probably one of the 'most important days in our democratic lives' The No campaign also seized on leaked documents suggesting the SNP would have to cut hundreds of millions of pounds from the NHS budget after the referendum. The Yes campaign described Westminster leaders’ last-ditch commitment as an ‘insult’ and asked why it was being made at such a late stage. Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond will today issue an appeal to voters not to be swayed by the ‘increasingly desperate and absurd scare stories being generated daily from Downing Street’. He will describe tomorrow’s referendum as ‘the greatest empowering moment any of us will ever have’. Today’s Survation poll is one of the final tests of public opinion before polling stations open. Voters were canvassed online between September 12 and yesterday morning. Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond will today issue an appeal to voters not to be swayed by the ‘increasingly desperate and absurd scare stories being generated daily from Downing Street’ The headline results show that 44.1 per cent of Scots plan to back independence, up from 42.4 per cent in a comparable poll from last week. Support for a No vote remains virtually static at 47.7 per cent, with 8.3 per cent undecided. Overall, this points to a final result of 52 per cent No and 48 per cent Yes. The poll confirms a gender divide across Scotland, with 49 per cent of men planning to vote Yes and 46 per cent saying No. Just 39 per cent of women plan to vote Yes, with 49 per cent choosing No. Alarmingly for the No camp, the poll indicates a shift back to Yes among Labour voters, who may decide the outcome. While 91 per cent of those who voted Conservative in the 2011 Holyrood elections are backing No, just 60 per cent of Labour voters plan to do the same. Damian Lyons Lowe, chief executive of Survation, said: ‘In terms of the race itself, with 8 per cent of the electorate still undecided, there is still everything to fight for and this poll should leave no room for complacency for the Better Together campaign.","No campaign takes a four-point lead into tomorrow's independence vote .

"Runaway grapes have been blamed for two of the three women suing Woolworths after slipping over on the floors at three of the supermarket chain’s stores in Queensland. Following Andrea Downie filing a $320,000 claim last month alleging she slipped on a grape and injured her back last year at the Tewantan store, another two women are now claiming for injuries. The two most recent claims, filed by Turner Freeman Lawyers in Ipswich on September 3, said Woolworths failed to keep the supermarket floors clean, Channel Nine reported. Redbank Plains resident Melissa Ann Haidle, 32, claims also she slipped on a grape as she walked down the bread aisle at Plainland on March 10 last year, causing her to fall backwards and injure her right knee. Her claim covers past and future loss of income from earnings and medical expenses. Melissa Ann Haidle claims she slipped on a grape as she walked down the bread aisle at Plainland on March 10 last year . While Ipswich woman Silvana Jevtic says she slipped on a 'green leafy substance' on the floor opposite the ice machines at the Yamanto Shopping Centre on March 31, 2012. Ms Jevtic alleged as she began to fall, her right foot jarred while she was holding onto her shopping trolley and her body twisted forcefully. Ms Jevtic 's District Court claim said although she did not hit the floor, she still injured her lower back. Daily Mail Australia is yet to have heard back from Woolworths about the two most recent claims. Andrea Downie says she slipped on a grape while shopping and can no longer work . This comes as Ms Downie claims the fall injured her back and caused an existing condition of post-traumatic stress disorder to flare up, meaning she could not return to work, reported the Courier Mail. Ms Downie is suing Woolworths claiming that the supermarket failed to keeps its floors clean. She also claims the grape was 'in clear view' of staff and that the supermarket chain failed to have an 'adequate system of inspecting floors'. Ms Downie claimed Woolworths staff failed to be alert to hazards and spills, or warn her about loose grapes on the floor. She also said Woolworths should place mats on the floor of the produce section to stop loose grapes from 'escaping' onto the floor. Woolworths defended itself against the claims saying that Ms Downie did not complain to staff about the fall when it occurred and that it is 'uncertain' of the truth of her claim. Scroll down for video . Ms Downie allegedly slipped wile shopping at the Tewantin story. The company says it is 'uncertain' if Ms Downie really did slip and fall, but if she did the damages she is claiming are 'excessive' 'If the fall occurred as alleged by [Ms Downie], it was not reported to anyone at Woolworths on the day,' the company states in its defence, reported the Courier Mail. Woolworths stated that if the incident did occur, the damages claimed by Ms Downie were 'grossly excessive and unreasonable' and any loss of income results from her pre-existing physical and psychiatric conditions. Woolworths offered to settle the case in April and the case will go to trial on November 17. Woolworths declined to comment further on the matter. Lawyer Sam Macedone told Today that the case was 'very interesting' because the incident was reported after the event. He advised anyone involved in a slip-and-fall incident to report the accident to management immediately. 'If you fall over and you believe it’s their fault, you’ve slipped on something that’s on the floor, make a report of it straight away… Make sure it's on the record,' he said.","Andrea Downie claims she slipped on a grape at Woolworths last year .

"A school has sent letters of apology to parents after 11-year-old pupils were given homework containing graphic references to a man’s severed penis. The Year 7 pupils at Mortimer Community College in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, were told in an assignment to read an extract from 1996 travel book Notes from a Small Island by Bill Bryson. But the relevant part of the book referred to the famous 1993 case of US couple John and Lorena Bobbit, saying how the wife ‘cuts off her husband's d*** and flings it out the window in a fit of pique’. Letters of apology: Pupils at Mortimer Community College (pictured) in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, were told in an assignment to read an extract from a book which contained graphic references to a man's severed penis . One parent described the homework assignment as ‘disgusting’, claiming the passage was packed with ‘filthy innuendos’ - but the school said the homework had been given out by mistake. Headmistresses Claire Mullane said: ‘This was a mistake. A member of staff had asked the students to read the extract but had not read it herself first. ‘She was supposed to have picked out a specific paragraph for the pupils to read rather than the whole extract. We in no way condone that sort of approach, however it was an error.’ The extract - part of 11 pages taken from the Bill Bryson book - made reference to the case of Mr and Mrs Bobbit, which hit the headlines 21 years ago when she sliced off his penis with an 8in knife. Famous incident: The relevant part of the book referred to the 1993 case of US couple Lorena (left) and John Bobbitt (right), saying how the wife 'cuts off her husband's d*** and flings it out the window in a fit of pique' Extract: The pupils had to read from 1996 travel book Notes from a Small Island (left) by Bill Bryson (right) Specific extracts from books by Mr Bryson are used by many schools as part of English lessons. Consider how much news space in Britain is devoted to marginal American figures like Oliver North, Lorena Bobbitt, and OJ. Simpson - a man who played a sport that most Britons don't understand and then made commercials for rental cars and that was it - and compare that with all the news reported in any year from  Scandinavia,  Austria, Switzerland, Greece,  Portugal and Spain. It's crazy really. If there's a political crisis in Italy or a nuclear spill in Karlsruhe, it gets maybe eight inches on an inside page. But if some woman in S***kicker, West Virginia, cuts off her husband's d*** and flings it out the window in a fit of pique, it's second lead on the 9 O'clock News and The Sunday Times is mobilizing the 'Insight' team. You figure it. [Strong language asterisked by MailOnline] . Mrs Mullane, 62, added: ‘Once we were aware of what had happened, we acted on it immediately and spoke to the class in question and apologised to them. ‘Myself and the member of staff have now written to parents of the pupils concerned and they should have received those letters at the weekend.’ One mother, whose child was given the homework, said: ‘I was disgusted that she came home with this. I appreciate the school apologised - but, in my eyes, the damage is done because the kids have read it now. ‘The headteacher said the extract should not have been included in the 11 pages given out. 'The whole thing was full of filthy innuendos. How the Government can say this is acceptable to use in school is beyond me. ‘What other people do in their homes with their children is entirely up to them, but my child does not hear anything like this at home. I’m mortified she has been spoon fed this from a teacher.’ Ofsted's last inspection of the school in December 2012 found it was 'good' - an improvement from its previous rating in 2010 of 'satisfactory'. It caters for almost 850 pupils aged between 11 and 16. In 1993, Ecuadorian-born Lorena Bobbitt was 24 and working as a manicurist in Manassas, Virginia while enduring physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her husband John Wayne Bobbitt. On June 23, 1993, he returned from a night of drinking and started to row with his then-wife. Mrs Bobbitt later told authorities that he raped her, but he was acquitted of the alleged attack. After he fell asleep, she went out to the kitchen and picked up an 8in knife before returning to the bedroom and slicing off his penis. She says the night was 'a blur'. In court: Mrs Bobbitt told authorities that her husband raped her, but he was acquitted of the alleged attack . Eight inches: The knife used by Mrs Bobbitt to cut off her husband's penis, used as evidence in her trial . Leaving him bleeding in their bed, she then jumped in the car and drove off, throwing the severed penis out of the window into a field. But moments later, she realised the severity of what she had done and alerted 911. A painstaking search uncovered his penis before doctors worked for nine hours to reattach it. This year marks 20 years since she was found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. Jurors agreed an 'irresistible impulse' provoked by abuse led her to attack her husband. Mrs Bobbitt is now living in Gainesville, Virginia, where she works in real estate, enjoys zumba and raises money for women's shelters. She has an eight-year-old daughter with a partner of 16 years.

He was jailed for assaulting Miss Elliott, and they never married . Popular chap: Mr Bobbitt is pictured at a water park in Las Vegas, Nevada, with Playboy Playmates in 1994. He became an actor in the pornography industry after the attack . Her ex-husband found that the surgeons' work to reattach his severed pens had been a success and he starred in a few pornographic films, including 'John Wayne Bobbitt Uncut'. In an interview last year, Mr Bobbitt claimed he had slept with around 70 women since the attack. But his celebrity lifestyle caught up with him and in 1994 he was jailed for 15 days for assaulting his then-fiance Kristina Elliott. They never married. He went on to marry two other women - a businesswoman in 2001 to whom he was wed for just 23 days, and a woman in 2002. The latter marriage ended after two years.","Year 7 pupils in South Shields told to read Notes from a Small Island .

"As disguises go, this one was definitely pants. This hapless burglar, who has become a laughing stock after he was spotted wearing his pants on his face during a raid on a bar's stockroom, is being sought by police in Belarus.

"David Cameron today accused Ed Miliband of 'wanting to live in a Marxist universe' as the two leaders clashed over how to tackle crippling energy bills. The Prime Minister accused the Labour leader of wanting to impose state control on markets while increasing costs for families with extra green levies. But Mr Miliband hit back, claiming the Tories could not decide if his policy to freeze bills for two years was 'a good idea or a communist plot'. Pressure: Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) and his shadow chancellor Ed Balls look shocked as David Cameron attacks their policy . Mr Miliband used his speech to last . month's Labour conference to announce he would promise millions of . families and businesses that bills will not rise from the 2015 election . until January 2017. The . energy price freeze drew immediate comparisons with the stance taken by . left-wing Labour governments in the 1970s to make dramatic interventions . in the way industry is run. Mr Miliband also promised to scrap the . energy watchdog Ofgem and use the 20 months to overall the competition . and transparency rules to smash the dominance of the Big Six energy . firms. It will save the average household £120 each and businesses will be £1,800 better off on their gas and electricity bills. Mr . Cameron initially dismissed the idea as 'nuts' but this week admitted . the idea of curbing rises had struck a chord with voters. Chancellor George Osborne claimed the Labour leader had put forward the same argument 'Karl Marx made in Das Kapital'. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Miliband said: 'Is freezing energy prices a good idea or a Communist plot?' Mr Cameron replied: 'I will leave the Communist plot to him.' He went on: 'You are committed to a new decarbonisation target that would add £125 to every bill in the country.' Clash: Prime Minister David Cameron dismissed Labour's energy bills freeze as a 'gimmick' and accused Labour party leader Ed Miliband of lurching to the left with state controls on business . The PM accused Mr Miliband of not understanding that national governments are unable to influence global oil and gas prices. 'I . know you want to live in some sort of Marxist universe where you can . control these things but you need a basic lesson in economics.' Mr Cameron said if Mr . Miliband did introduce the price freeze, it would only lead to higher . energy costs for households and businesses in the long-term. 'This . isn't a policy, it's a gimmick and the reason it's a gimmick is that . you are in favour of a decarbonisation target that would add £125 to . everybody's bill. 'Now it is obvious why you want to talk about the cost of living, because you do not have an economic policy any more.' Bills: Tackling the cost of living has become a major political battleground . But Mr Miliband hit back, telling the Prime Minister he had no answer to Labour's new policy to freeze energy prices. The Labour leader said the Government's policy to help consumers switch to the lowest energy tariff would not help 90 per cent of the population, whereas his policy would benefit 27 million households and 2.4 million businesses across the country. Mr Miliband said: 'What is clear is that you are floundering around and you have no answer to Labour's energy price freeze. 'You didn't even defend your own policy, which won't benefit 90 per cent of the country. You have no idea. 'You say you want to bring energy prices down but can you confirm that energy prices have gone up by £300 since you became Prime Minister?' But Mr Cameron insisted energy prices doubled under Labour and electricity prices went up by 50 per cent.","Labour would legislate to freeze bills from May 2015 to January 2017 .

"A US man who is on a federal aviation watch list was asked to undergo additional screening after his flight landed because security officers apparently failed to carry out the necessary checks before he boarded the plane. The flight carrying Kahler Nygard was already in the sky by the time Transportation Security Administration officials realised the error. The 22-year-old was once on a ‘no-fly list’ but is now on a ‘selectee list’ that calls for a more rigorous screening process than usual before boarding. Scroll down for video . Kahler Nygard (right) was asked to undergo additional security screening when he landed at Denver's airport . But Kahler insists the appropriate screening was completed before he boarded the Spirit Airlines flight in Minneapolis and claims the TSA’s attempt to do an additional check was harassment. Kahler, from Orono, Minnesota, and a friend documented his experience in a series of mobile phone videos that have been posted online. When the flight landed in Denver earlier this month, Kahler was asked to disembark before all other passengers and submit himself to a secondary search. One of the videos shows him in the terminal at Denver International Airport, where he was greeted by a group of TSA officers who asked him to step into a private area so they could ‘screen your body and your bags’. YouTube moment: Kahler Nygard's used his mobile phone to film his encounter with TSA officers . In the video, Kahler refuses to co-operate and questions why the search is required and whether he is being detained. The TSA does not have the authority to detain passengers. The officer, who is wearing latex gloves, tells him: ‘We need to do some screening that may or may not have been completed in Minneapolis.’ When Kahler asks the officer why the screening has to be done after his flight landed, he is told: 'Because it wasn't completed in Minneapolis.' But Kahler refuses to accompany him as the argument goes back and forth: ‘If I travelled from point A to point B safely why does there now need to be more screening before I am allowed to leave? That would lead to me believe that I am being detained would it not? Are you detaining me?’ Kahler decides to walk away after the officer informs him he is not being detained but that he would be apprehended by Denver police if he doesn’t agree to the search. He later flew back to Minneapolis without any trouble. TSA officers surround Kahler Nygard as he is told that some screening 'may or may not have been completed' Another video shows him exiting the plane in Denver in front of confused passengers. He tells the camera: 'I’m the only one walking off the airplane right now, so this is really interesting. 'They let me fly all the way to Denver so here I am. Look at everybody here, they’re wondering what’s going on with this guy. No, I have not committed a crime.’ A third video, recorded by a friend, purports to show Kahler being patted down by a security officer at Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport before he boarded the flight to Denver. A TSA officer speaks to a co-worker or supervisor after Kahler Nygard refused to co-operate . Passengers who are on the ‘selectee list’ receive a boarding pass with four bold S’s printed on it. That alerts security officers that more rigorous screening, including a physical patdown and a bag check, is required. But reports by Fox affiliate KMSP-TV in Minneapolis and NBC affiliate KUSA in Denver suggest that the extra screening did not occur. A Spirit Airlines spokesperson told KMSP-TV that the flagged boarding pass was noticed by an airline employee who contacted the TSA. The TSA told MailOnline Travel that it is reviewing the incident and 'all passengers are thoroughly screened before boarding a commercial aircraft.’ A TSA officer informed Kahler Nygard that he would be apprehended by police if he didn't agree to the search . Kahler told KUSA he found out three years ago he was on the US government’s ‘no-fly list’ but no one would tell him why. He insisted he has no connection to terrorism and has suggested that he landed himself in trouble with comments he previously posted on a political website used by people who consider themselves ‘sovereign citizens’. Three years ago he was turned away and detained when he attempted to board a flight from Colorado to Minnesota. MailOnline has contacted the TSA, Spirit Airlines and Denver Police Department for comment.","Kahler Nygard was asked to exit the plane in front of other passengers .

"Four gang members who murdered a teenage rapper and left his friend severely disfigured after they had been mocked on a YouTube video have been jailed for a total of 107 years. Mohammed Hussain, 22, Rubel Miah, 19, his brother Javed Miah, 21, and Fahim Khan, 20, drove around Bedford in a hired white Range Rover armed with knives and meat cleavers. Their victim, aspiring rapper Isaac Stone, 19, was chased and trapped by the gang, before being punched, kicked and stabbed repeatedly, with a wound which penetrated his left lung proving fatal. His friend Shajidur Rahman, 20, was left permanently disfigured with deep scars to his face and head after an attack carried out by Rubel Miah and Fahim Khan. His nose was amputated and he suffered four deep slashes to his head and face. Shajidur Rahman, 20, said he tried to defend himself but after the second or third blows he felt 'dizzy' Mohammed Hussain (left), 22 and Rubel Miah (right), 19, are part of the gang guilty of the murder of Isaac Stone . Fahim Khan (left), 20, and Javed Miah (right) 21, were also convicted of murder at Luton crown court . Prosecutor Vincent Coughlin QC told Luton crown court that the motive for the 'murderous attack' at 6.20 at night on Saturday January 25 this year was not entirely clear. But the day before, an amateur music video called 'Go Missing' was posted on YouTube in which Isaac Stone, Shajidur Rahman and others appeared. In the course of the film, alcohol was sprayed over the name 'Raz' that had been painted on a wall. 'It upset someone,' said Mr Coughlin. The prosecutor described how 'perhaps for show' a white Range Rover had been hired from Luton for £150 and in Bedford two meat cleavers were bought for £2.99 each from a hardware shop. Aspiring rapper Isaac Stone was murdered by the gang of four in January this year . The group encountered Isaac Stone, who was driving a white Corsa with Mr Rahman and two others as passengers. The jury was shown CCTV which showed a fast-moving street brawl ending with Isaac being cornered behind a parked car. By the time he arrived at Bedford hospital there was no sign of a pulse and he was pronounced dead at 7.15pm. Giving evidence, Shajidur Rahmah, who has been permanently disfigured, said he had seen two defendants, Rubel Miah and Fahim Khan, earlier that night in an alleyway. He said they told him they had not got a problem with him, but had a problem with Isaac and another youth. Mr Rahmah added that he thought there was to be a fight with no weapons. He went on: 'Everyone froze. We said 'we have got to sort it.' We never anticipated it would lead to what happened. 'It happened so quick. We stopped. We did not think weapons were involved. We thought it was a fist fight. Isaac said ""They have got something in their hands.""' Mr Rahmah went on to say they got out of the car and Rubel Miah and Fahim Khan came towards them. 'Fahim came up to me,' he said. 'I thought he had a hammer. It had a blue wrapping over the handle. I got hit by Fahim. I didn't know at the time that it was a meat cleaver.' He tried to defend himself but after the second or third blows he felt 'dizzy'. His nose was sliced off with a meat cleaver and left at the scene. The four youths all denied murder, attempted murder and two counts of possession of an offensive weapon. Isaac Stone, 19, was punched, kicked and stabbed several times, with a wound to his left lung proving fatal . But the jury  convicted all four of Isaac's murder. The youths were cleared of the attempted murder of Shajidur Rahman, but Rubel Miah and Fahim Khan were found guilty of causing him grievous bodily harm with intent. All four were convicted of two charges of possessing offensive weapons. In June 2012, Rubel Miah and Fahim Khan were sentenced for their part in a shooting of a car dealer at the Peri Peri restaurant in Bedford. Each received three years for possessing a shotgun with intent to cause fear of violence. Rubel's uncle Aktar Miah, then 25, was found guilty of attempted murder and received a life sentence saying he must serve a minimum term of 12 years before being considered for parole. Isaac's mother Yvette Lendore said: 'Everybody loved Isaac and Isaac loved everybody. 'He was no angel but he was not a horrible or vindictive person. 'He used to play for Bedford Town, which is where he got the name Dynamic because he was so quick. 'Then he got into his music and just loved it. I am not going to lie, it is not all positive things in that music but some people take the words literally but they are just lyrics'. She said he was the first pupil to be made a prefect at Harrowden Middle School and that between 800 and 900 people turned up at his funeral.","Youths hired white range rover and bought two meat cleavers for £2.99 each .

"At first glance, it may look like a log covered in insects, or even two snakes moving in tandem. But this wriggling mass is made up of hundreds of fungus gnat larvae, or larval Sciaridae, swarming together. It is thought the insects travel en masse to deter predators, and those on the inside are the dominant members of the group being shielded by the lesser members. Scroll down for video . The stuff of nightmares? This wriggling mass is made up of hundreds of fungus gnat larva, or larval Sciaridae, swarming together. It is thought the insects travel en masse to put off predators and those on the outside are the dominant members of the group . While they appear more conspicuous, they ‘look hard,’ Dr Erica McAlister, fly curator at the Natural History Museum, London, told MailOnline. ‘Birds are more likely to think it’s a snake than larvae,’ she said. Dr Sophie Evison, a biology lecturer at Leeds University explained that the insects are demonstrating ‘the selfish herd theory’. This is when individuals within a population – in this case gnat larvae - attempt to reduce the odds of being eaten by putting others of their own species between themselves and predators, resulting in an aggregation, or swarm. The theory was proposed by W. D. Hamilton in 1971 to explain the gregarious behaviour observed in a variety of animals, including insects, schools of fish and even herds of wildebeest. ‘The outer layer of larvae are more exposed than creatures towards the centre, so the less dominant ones are on the outside,’ she said. The idea is that subordinate animals will be forced into higher risk positions and you can see the larvae changing places in the swarm as it wiggles along. It is thought that the tiny creatures signify their dominance using chemical trails, which lots of insects use to move along together. Steve Ormerod, Professor of Ecology at Cardiff University’s School of Biosciences, told MailOnline: ‘Aggregations of insects can occur around resources such as food, shelter or, in adult insects, mates. ‘The avoidance of predators can also cause aggregations - where the likelihood of any individual being preyed upon is reduced where the predator or swamped or affected by some consequence of group behaviour.’ The sight was captured at an unknown location in the U.S. where the larvae seem to be 'walking' along the pavement. While gnat larvae aggregations may seem rare, many examples have been documented in that species, and in others such as sawfly in Brazil, where Dr Evison said they are common. ‘You’re unlikely to see them in this climate because it’s not warm enough. Insects are exothermic and rely on the sun to warm up,’ she said. Professor Jim Hardie, Director of Science at the Royal Entomological Society, said: 'There are over 400 species of fungus gnats in the UK and the larvae, of some species at least, will form these swarms.' Fungus gnats usually feed on fungi and rotting leaves, while the adults fly around houses in the summer. 'Not much is known about the larval stages or life cycles, but the normal environment for larvae and their fungus food supply, is moist. 'If the area dries out or populations build too high, a cohesive mass may be assisted by an aggregation,' he said. Charles Brues of Harvard University, wrote an account of this strange sight over 50 years ago. He wrote: ‘On the morning of June 15, 1949 we witnessed a mass migration of fungus-gnat larvae in the rainforest zone of Negros Island - an island in the Philippines - at an altitude of about 4,000ft (1,200 metres). ‘Close to a temporary shelter in which we were housed, my wife noticed a strange crawling object moving over the wet, muddy soil. ‘Closer examination at once disclosed that this was an irregular, band-like mass of small dipterous maggots.’ He identified them as Heerwiirmer or snake-worms. ‘…The mass of larvae was moving slowly in a very irregular band about a foot in length, less than an inch in width and layered to a depth of about half an inch. ‘As has been described in some previously observed cases, the individual larvae were moving on the slimy bodies of their fellows so that progression is accomplished by the forward motion of those on the top, while those at the rear, as they are uncovered, move with a sort of superficial, belt-like, rolling motion over the cramped individuals in the lower layers. ‘Thus, the mass moves onward, but the larvae are continually changing position with reference to one another.’","It's thought the insects travel en masse to deter predators .

"New footage shows a beaming Rik Mayall lounging in an armchair and reciting Shakespeare's thoughts on death in what would become his last TV interview. The comic star of Bottom and The Young Ones, who died  aged 56 in June, talked about his literary heroes just weeks before he suffered an 'acute cardiac event' returning from a morning run. The interview came as he recited a cheeky 'bedtime story' for an adults' version of Jackanory, the famed BBC storytime show. Scroll down for video . Depth: Rik Mayall's final screen interview shows the beaming star quoting Shakespeare's Macbeth on the futility of life. 'See, I mean he could write,' he said. 'He was a belter, old Shakey Bill. He could squeak a nib' Anarchic: The appearance came decades after the late star prompted a storm of complaints with an animated reading of George's Marvellous Medicine, by Roald Dahl, on the children's TV show favourite Jackanory . His appearance would have come more than 20 years after he gave a memorably anarchic reading on Jackanory of George's Marvellous Medicine by Roald Dahl - prompting a storm of complaints to the BBC. Mr Mayall, who appeared to be in perfect health until his death, sat in an armchair as he talked about his favourite storytellers and recited one of the most famous soliloquies from Macbeth. 'Storytelling has always been one of my great pleasures', he said. 'I'd love Shakey Bill to tell me a story, I mean, William Shakespeare, he could squeak a nib couldn't he? '""Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace to the last syllable of recorded time, and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Quoting Act 5 of Shakespeare's Macbeth, the star says: 'Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace to the last syllable of recorded time, and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death' The death in June of the comedian (pictured right in The New Statesman) prompted an outpouring of tributes . '""Out, out brief candle. Life's but a passing shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his weary hour upon the stage and then, is heard no more. '""It is a tale told by an idiot. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""' 'See, I mean he could write, he was a belter, old Shakey Bill, he could squeak a nib. 'So imagine someone who could write as well as that saying: 'Good even Rik, I have a story to tell you. You'd go: 'Er, go on then. What? What?' Popular: Rik Mayall as Richie with Adrian Edmondson as Eddie in the 1990s BBC hit Bottom . The passage recited by the comedian comes at the climax of Macbeth, as the traitor king of the title is surrounded by English troops and facing his own death. In the original work, Shakespeare uses 'walking shadow' instead of Mayall's 'passing shadow', but the effect is the same. It is seen as the moment when he realises the futility of everything he has done in the play up to that point, including murdering the king and deceiving those closest to him. Mr Mayall's other favourite storytellers were more light-hearted. 'When I was young I saw some of my heroes doing it on the telly,' he said. 'We're talking about Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, Arthur Lowe, Ian McKellan, Kenneth Williams. These were all guys telling stories to me. 'It's one of telly's great things. I personally like doing it too, I did Jackanory - I did Roald Dahl tale called George's Marvellous Medicine which there was a bit of a fuss about at the time. 'It was basically a story about a boy trying to poison his grandmother and I did it in kind of a lively way so there were complaints. .I'd like to have [American horror actor] Vince Price read me a story. He's got such a lovely voice and such a great manner. 'I think [American horror author] HP Lovecraft is who I'd like to have read me a story as well, probably Marilyn of course, Kate Moss.' The comedian's sudden death in June prompted an outpouring of tributes from colleagues and his wife Barbara, who thanked the press for 'all the wonderful coverage', adding: 'It would have made him very happy.' She added: 'I am sure that you all know Rik's response would be something along the lines of.....""well thanks very much all of you.............now f*** off!!!""' Although not part of the show itself, the interview was carried out while filming an episode of Crackanory - an adults' version of the classic TV show Jackanory - which will air next week. Tongue-in-cheek: The comedian read a story about a weather presenter who can control the elements . Starring alongside David Mitchell, Vic Reeves and Johnny Vegas, the comedian reads Tony Way's The Weather Man, a tongue-in-cheek story about a weather presenter who can control the elements but whose hero is Michael Fish. Publicity producer Aidan Hackett, who interviewed him, said: 'He gave the best interview out of anyone we spoke to. He was really lovely - exactly how you would expect Rik to be. 'We had really good fun. He was taking the p*** out of us, but we were all having a laugh.'

"A grieving mother burned to death after setting fire to herself in a train toilet - on the 14th anniversary of the day she killed her son. Rachel James had spent 10 years in a mental hospital after stabbing her 5-year-old son Perry to death. She had been released to live alone in the community and was travelling on a train from Northampton to London when she went into a cubicle and set herself alight after pouring petrol over herself, an inquest heard today. Tragic: Rachel James, left, burned to death after setting fire to herself in a train toilet on the 14th anniversary of the day she killer her son Perry, right . The fire brought the train to a halt just to the north of Leighton Buzzard station in Bedfordshire. The overhead power lines were switched off and other passengers were evacuated. Firefighters put out the blaze on Monday April 11. Passenger Christopher Gardener told Bedfordshire Deputy Coroner Bob Amos that he was sitting in a carriage with his back to the toilet wall. A younger woman was in the toilet when Ms James asked him if it was occupied. He said Ms James, who had long blonde hair and was well tanned, waited and the two women walked past each other. He said: 'Shortly afterwards there was a whooshing noise that was ever so powerful. A flash flame went past me very, very quickly . It must have passed by my side. There were no injuries to me. Horrific: The fire involving Rachel James brought this train to a halt just to the north of Leighton Buzzard station in Bedfordshire . 'I thought there had been a terrible accident. I went to the toilet door and flames were coming out. The door appeared to be locked. 'She was screaming, not for help but screaming in agony. I couldn’t open the door. I banged on it and rattled the lock.' Mr Gardener said he pulled the emergency stop button and jumped out of the safe side of the train, running to the front to alert the driver. He said thick black smoke was coming from the carriage. When aged 29 Ms James had been charged with the murder of Perry and attempted murder of his 9 year old brother Aaron in an attack on April 11 1997. She appeared at Watford magistrates court and was sent to a psychiatric hospital. The single mother - who was then called Helen Philips - stabbed Perry to death and stabbed Aaron and battered him with a hammer after snapping under the pressure of debts at their flat in Northend, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. The first her neighbours knew of the tragedy was when she appeared in the window of her flat with Perry’s lifeless body in her arms. Death: Rachel James stabbed and killed her son Perry at their flat in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which is pictured in 1997 . She had threatened to turn on the gas and blow the house up if anyone came near. Police got into the flat to find Perry dead. An ambulance rushed the older boy to hospital with stab wounds to his head. The inquest heard the 43-year-old, who was living in a council flat in Whitehall Road, Uxbridge, West London had been deeply troubled about the death of Perry. Her friend Marlene Glover said Ms James had stayed with her and her husband John in Milton Keynes the previous night and they had agreed to accompany her as far as Leighton Buzzard on her return back to London on the train. Mrs Glover said : 'She said it was the 14th anniversary of her son’s death. She seemed ok but was depressed about the anniversary. She said: ""I have got to face it.""' She said Ms James had told her that she had been told that she had tried to contact her older son but had been told he did not want to see her. 'Family life was something she wanted but could not have. She had tried to kill herself a year before. It was Mother’s Day a week before this happened and it was the anniversary of her son’s death.' The impression they had of Ms James was that she feared that she was going to have to go back to hospital. John Glover told the hearing: 'I think she was a little bit paranoid and thought that the Mental Health People were after her. 'That is why she wanted us to go on the train with her to Leighton Buzzard as that was the only stop before London. In recording a verdict of suicide, . Deputy Coroner Bob Amos said: 'Rachel James experienced trauma and loss . in life to a degree that any normal man or woman would find difficult to . comprehend. Detained: Rachel James - then called Helen Philips - is pictured being arrested by police officers in 1997 . 'She suffered a profound . psychotic episode in 1997 in which she took the life of her child. I . understand it was her intention in the same event to take her own life. 'She was convicted of manslaughter and detained under the Mental Health Act. 'She recovered significantly in the following years but she never recovered that which she wanted most, a family life. 'Her son (Aaron) was estranged . and her two children born subsequently to that terrible event were . adopted, removed into care straight from birth. 'One can only imagine the . consequence the emotional trauma that caused with the father. In . November 2006 he took his own life by setting fire to himself. 'In early 2011 she attempted to speak to her son (Aaron) but it came to nought. 'I do find that in effect she was saying farewell to them. 'She was in the cubicle for a very short period of time, at most 60 seconds. 'She had time to do little more . than complete the necessary physical actions in order to set fire to . herself. She must have made up her mind resolutely before entering the . cubicle. 'I do conclude that she took her own life.' The cause of death was 'incineration.'

"The wife of a former NFL player has said the league did more to protect her enraged husband than to help her when she called for help as he was smashing the walls of their home with a baseball bat. Dewan Smith-Williams says she called her husband Wally Williams' NFL liaison and was told: 'Don't call the police.' Ms Smith-Williams is speaking out about the abuse the says she suffered at her husband's hands to help raise awareness about the spouses of violent NFL players. Cry for help: Dewan Smith-Williams says when her husband became violent, she called his NFL liaison, who told her, 'Don't call the police' The league's handling of the Ray Rice domestic violence arrest has engulfed professional football in scandal and threatens to undercut the popularity of the most profitable sport in America. Rice was suspended for just two games after he was charged. When video from the incident emerged last week that showed him punching his then-fiance and knocking her out, fans were outraged. The league responded by banning Rice indefinitely - despite claims that officials had already seen the video. Ms Smith-Williams told the New York Daily News that the NFL offered her no help when she hid in fear from her 6-foot-2 offensive lineman husband while he was playing for the New Orleans Saints. Williams retired from the NFL in 2003, after ten seasons. 'He went and got a baseball bat and was hitting the walls and doors. I ran into a room, shut the door and called his NFL liaison to say I was really afraid,' she told the Daily News. Wally Williams, right, played ten years in the NFL as an offensive lineman - retiring in 2003 . The liaison told her: 'Don’t call the police, we’ll handle it.’ She says she was instructed to let her husband leave the house and that the NFL liaison would call her back to make sure she was OK. She never got a return phone call, she claims. Mr Williams, currently a football commentator on CBS sports radio in Baltimore, could not be reached for comment. She says NFL teams, league officials and even the police 'turn their heads to everything until something horrible is exposed.' Ms Smith-Williams is still married to her husband - though they live separately. She left him and moved to Ohio, where she became a psychiatric nurse who deals with victims of domestic abuse.","Dewan Smith-Williams says she begged her husband Wally Williams' NFL liaison for help and help never came .

Leaving: Hernandez is en route to becoming a Real player and confirming his United departure . Real manager Carlo Ancelotti kept quiet about the move for 26-year-old Hernandez after the loss, but conceded that his side needed to change after letting a two-goal lead slip. 'This defeat changes nothing regarding the transfer market,' Ancelotti insisted. 'It's our problem, of concentration. We have to work much harder not to make these mistakes.

"A Texas woman who has been on death row for eight years following the 2004 death of her girlfriend's son will be executed tomorrow. Lisa Ann Coleman, 38, of Arlington, Texas, was found guilty of capital murder in the death of nine-year-old Davontae Williams, who had been beaten and bound, and whose body bore more than 250 scars when officials discovered him on July 26, 2004. He had also been starved, weighing a mere 35 pounds at the time of his death. Tragic end: Lisa Ann Coleman (left) will be executed tomorrow after being convicted of capital murder in the 2004 death of her girlfriend's son, Davontae Williams (right) Coleman's girlfriend, Marcella Williams, was also charged with capital murder and is currently serving a life sentence after reaching a plea deal in her son's death. Prosecutor's in Coleman's case used the charge of kidnapping to justify asking for the death penalty. According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, they argued that Coleman 'did not allow Davontae to have visitors, kept him from visiting others by restraining him and told people he was not at the apartment when he was there.' The young boy's ultimate cause of death was malnutrition. Paramedics who arrived on the scene after it was reported the child was having trouble breathing found him dressed in nothing but bandages and a diaper, and reported that the boy had clearly been dead for several hours. A jury deliberated for just three hours in June 2006 before recommending the death penalty. Williams, who was just 14-years-old when she gave birth to Davontae, had been investigated by Child Protective Services seven time between 1995 and 2002. In 2002, they lost track of  the family. Life in prison: Davontae's mother, Marcella Williams (above) is serving life in prison after reaching a plea deal in the death of her son, who weighed just 35 pounds when he succumbed to malnutrition . Death row: Coleman's mugshot at the time of her initial arrest back in 2004 . Coleman’s appellate attorney, John Stickels, filed a clemency application in August asking that Texas governor Rick Perry commute her sentence to life in prison, but a board voted unanimously earlier this week to not recommend commutation. 'What she’s really guilty of is being a black lesbian,' Stickels said. 'If she is executed, it will be because of her sexual orientation. Her sexual orientation played a role in the state choosing to seek the death penalty and in her getting the death penalty.' According to The Austin Chronicle, four witnesses who lived in the same apartment complex as Williams and Coleman report seeing Davontae around the neighborhood unrestrained and in good spirits just days before his death. These witnesses all submitted affidavits on Coleman's behalf to help her attorneys as they attempted to appeal her case by questioning the legitimacy of the kidnapping charges. Coleman will be will be the sixth woman put to death in Texas since 1982, and the ninth person this year. The last woman to be executed in Texas was Suzanne Basso, who received a lethal injection on February 5, 2014.","Lisa Ann Coleman, 38, will be executed tomorrow for the death of nine-year-old Davontae Williams .

"A Utah man killed his estranged wife and shot his daughter in the hand as she tried to flee the scene before turning the gun on himself Friday evening in a horrific murder-suicide. 52-year-old Richard Candland, of Ogden, Utah, killed his estranged wife, 51-year-old Cynthia Candland, just weeks after she filed for divorce. He also shot his 22-year-old daughter Heather Candland as she was fleeing the scene, who luckily manged to get out and call authorities. Scroll down for video .

The daughter called police around 5 pm Friday after she got away from her enraged father. Cynthia, who taught nursing at nearby Weber State University, had filed for divorce from her husband on Aug. 25, and sought a restraining order from him at the same time according to the Standard-Examiner. It is not known at this point why she wanted a restraining order, though coworkers seem to think it may have had something to do with a domestic abuse situation. 'She did fear for her life but it had only been over the past few months, it was a sudden change that had taken place in her family life,' said Susan Thornton, chair of the Weber State School of Nursing. Others say she wanted to keep her husband from touching her savings account and retirement fund. One neighbor, Jalene Ward, told Fox 13 Salt Lake City that Richard admitted he struggled with depression at times. Family: Heather (above with brother Bryan) was able to call for help, but it was too late to save her mother's life . It is also not known yet why Richard became angry enough at his daughter Heather to shoot the recent college graduate. She was treated at a local hospital and released.

"Darrell Simester, 44, was found living in squalid living conditions with torn clothes at a farm near Newport . A 'vulnerable' missing man was kept like a slave and forced to work 15-hour days with no pay for 13 years, a trial has heard. Darrell Simester, 44, was found living in squalid living conditions at Cariad Farm, near Newport, with teeth missing and burns on his legs. He slept in a rat-infested shed and was allegedly told he would be buried with the horses if he tried to escape, Cardiff Crown Court heard. Daniel Doran, 67, and his son David Dan Doran, 42, denied a charge of requiring Mr Simester to perform compulsory labour between April 2010 and March 2013. Mr Simester disappeared after arguing with friends on a holiday in the south Wales resort of Porthcawl in 2000. A jury heard the 44-year-old regularly washed himself in an animal's feeding trough and used a broken outdoor toilet that would only flush with a bucket of water and a stick. Prosecuting counsel John Hipkin QC said when Mr Simester was eventually tracked down by his worried family from Kidderminster they found him in a 'horrific state' and virtually unrecognisable. Doctors later found him in poor health - with a large and painful hernia protruding from his groin and scrotum, cystic swelling to his back, burns to his legs and callouses on his feet. Mr Hipkin said: 'His brother Duncan walked through the farm gate - he saw a man shovelling manure into a wheel barrow. 'Duncan approached him and after a little time recognised it was his brother. He was in a bad physical condition. 'He was hunched over and wearing ripped clothes and shoes. Darrell Simester for his own part didn't recognise his own brother and looked scared. 'His father when he saw him described him as being in a horrific state, hunched over and barely able to walk. He was filthy.' Scroll down for video .

Mr Simester (left) was suffering with a large and painful hernia protruding from his groin and scrotum, cystic swelling to his back and burns to his legs when he was found . He said there was little doubt that Mr Simester was kept against his will. 'Darrell Simester was a man of timid disposition who for 13 years was forced to work against his will and under menace,' said Mr Hipkin. 'A local police officer who entered his caravan said it looked as if it had been simply left to rot... and considered it to be unfit for human habitation. 'While accommodated in the shed... He was not provided with any bedding or covers and would place his jacket that he had worked in covered in manure over him to keep him warm. 'The toilet which Darrell used was broken and did not flush. He had to use a stick to get rid of his excreta. 'Darrell Simester regarded the defendants as his bosses. He worked (virtually) every day for 13 years. Daniel Doran, 67, and his son David Dan Doran, 42, denied a charge of requiring Mr Simester to perform compulsory labour at Cardiff Crown Court . 'His working day would start at 7am and and he would finish between 9pm and 10pm. He did not receive any pay at all. 'You (the jury) will have to decide whether Mr Simester remained at the farm as a volunteer because he preferred life there, or whether he was coerced to stay while under some form of threat.' Mr Simester told officers he had tried to leave on two occasions - once after a spade had been thrown at him - but he had been caught and taken back to the farm by David Doran. 'Darrell was told he would be buried out the back where the horses who had been shot were buried', said Mr Simester. His parents Tony Simester, 66, and Jean, 61, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, contacted the police around 50 times but were never able to locate their son. But after years of searching, they finally tracked him down in the remote farm in south Wales following an anonymous tip-off. Police raided the farm and took Darrell away for medical treatment. He was suffering with a large and painful hernia protruding from his groin and scrotum, cystic swelling to his back, burns to his legs, a fungal infection and callouses on his feet and terrible teeth. The family said Darrell had been to the hospital several times since he came home and had undergone an operation. His father said his problems were 'all down to the conditions he has been subjected to over the last 13 years', but his mother confirmed he was 'getting stronger and coping very well'.

"Steven St. Jacques has been charged with stealing $100 in birthday money from an autistic man . A 27-year-old man has been charged with stealing $100 in birthday money from an autistic man in a crime that was captured by video cameras. Police say they charged Steven St. Jacques of Stamford on Monday with second-degree larceny after a search of his home turned up clothing that matched those worn by the suspect in the video. Officers say they received important tips after posting the video of last Tuesday's robbery on YouTube at the Connecticut park. The surveillance footage of the theft at Veteran's Park shows the suspect entering the park from Old Main Street behind Patrick Kogut, the 27-year-old victim. The suspect then followed the victim into a breezeway where he can be seen engaging Kogut in conversation and talking him into pulling the cash out of his pocket. Kogut excitedly shows the suspect the money, which he had received for his birthday from his family. He puts it into the suspect's hand and he is seen examining it before apparently taunting Kogut by holding it in front of him but not letting him have it back.

"The only thing protecting Earth from a 'city-killer'-sized asteroid has been 'blind luck', according to former astronaut Ed Lu. But despite the serious nature of the threat, a recent report claims Nasa's efforts to protect the Earth has fallen short. The space agency won't meet its goal to find 90 percent of potentially dangerous asteroids larger than 460ft (140 metres) in diameter, the agency's Inspector General said. Scroll down for video . Nasa won't meet its goal to find 90 percent of potentially dangerous asteroids larger than 460ft (140 metres) in diameter, the agency's Inspector General said . The shortfall comes despite a 10-fold increase in Nasa's annual asteroid budget over the past five years - from $4 million ($2.47 million) in 2009 to $40 million ($24.7 million) in 2014. The money was set aside to track and assess potentially dangerous asteroids and comets, or so-called 'Near-Earth Objects' (NEOs), that fly within about 28 million miles (45 million km) of Earth. The agency's efforts are poorly coordinated, ill-managed and under-staffed, according to a 32-page report. The report, titled 'Nasa's Efforts to Identify Near-Earth Objects and Mitigate Hazards,' was led by Nasa's Inspector General Paul Martin. This graphic shows the orbits of all the known Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), numbering over 1,400 as of early 2013. These are the asteroids considered hazardous because they are fairly large (at least 460 feet or 140 meters in size), and because they follow orbits that pass close to the Earth's orbit . Humanity, says Brian Cox, is at risk of being wiped out by asteroids – and we’re not taking the threat seriously. ‘There is an asteroid with our name on it and it will hit us,’ Professor Cox told MailOnline. In fact, the Earth had a ‘near-miss’ only a few months ago. ‘We didn’t see it,’ says the 46-year-old physicist. ‘We saw it on the way out, but if it had just been a bit further over it would have probably wiped us out. These things happen.’ The bus-sized asteroid, named 2014 EC, came within 38,300 (61,637km) miles of Earth in March - around a sixth of the distance between the moon and our planet. No one really knows when a serious impact could happen. ‘It could be tomorrow,’ Professor Cox said. ‘The thing that bothers me about that is we do know how to do something about it.’ But ideas such as this aren’t progressing fast enough, he claims. ‘I think its human stupidity we need to worry about. ‘It’s the way we behave, but also just the way we don’t accumulate knowledge at the rate that we could.’ ‘We just don’t. I mean, you can see it by the figures. We spend virtually as much on it as everyone else, which is sod all.’ 'Nasa estimates that it has identified only about 10 percent of all asteroids 460ft (140 metres) and larger,' Mr Martin wrote. 'Given its current pace and resources, [Nasa] has stated that it will not meet the goal of identifying 90 per cent of such objects by 2020.' A one-person office manages a 'loosely structured conglomerate of research activities that are not well integrated and (which) lack overarching program oversight, objectives and established milestones to track progress,' the report said. Nasa has found about 95 per cent of the largest and potentially most destructive asteroids, those measuring about 0.62 mile (1 km) or larger in diameter. About 66 million years ago, a 6.2-mile (10-km) -wide object hit what is now Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, triggering global climate changes that are believed to have led to the demise of the dinosaurs. More recently, a fragment of an asteroid estimated to be just 59ft (18 meters) in diameter exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia. The force of the explosion last year matched the energy released in 30 atomic bombs, blowing out windows and destroying buildings. More than 1,000 people were injured by flying debris. 'Recent research suggests that Chelyabinsk-type events occur every 30 to 40 years,' the Office of Inspector General report said, adding that most impacts would occur in the ocean rather than in populated areas. The aftermath of Chelyabinsk. Although Nasa is monitoring the skies, no one really knows when a serious impact could happen. As of July 2014, the agency has discovered about 11,230 NEOs, including 862 of the largest asteroids . Since 1998, Nasa has spent about $100 million (£61.6 million) on programmes to find, assess and mitigate potentially threatening space neighbours. As of July 2014, the agency has discovered about 11,230 NEOs, including 862 of the largest asteroids. That figure includes only about 10 per cent of the smaller nearby asteroids that are about 460 ft (140 meters) wide, far short of the agency's goal to find 90 percent by 2020, the report said. The report made five recommendations for improving up Nasa's asteroid detection efforts, including adding at least four to six employees to help manage the program and coordinating projects with other U.S. and international agencies and with privately funded initiatives. Nasa's Associate Administrator for Science John Grunsfeld said in a letter to Mr Martin he expects a new NEO program to be in place by September 2015.

"Rymel Downer, 25, was jailed for 17 years after a man was shot in the mouth in south Manchester in May, last year . A man has been jailed for an attempted murder outside a barber’s shop after his DNA was found on a lollipop in the burnt-out getaway car. Rymel Downer, 25, was jailed for 17 years after a man was shot in the mouth in south Manchester in May, last year. The 21-year-old victim was hit when three shots were fired from a BMW 330D on Lloyd Street South, Fallowfield, at 3.30pm on May 25. The getaway car was later found burnt out in Whalley Range. But forensics teams recovered a lollipop next to the gearstick, containing Downer’s DNA. A CD wallet left in the vehicle also had Downer’s fingerprints on it. Detectives gathered further evidence against him. It included mobile phone records which proved he was in south Manchester at the time of the shooting. Det Chief Insp Pete Marsh, of GMP’s Major Incident Team, said: 'It is utterly miraculous that the young victim survived this attempt on his life. 'Everything about this incident points to a concerted effort to kill the victim and it is only by the tiniest of margins that he survived. 'Downer was clearly confident of getting away with his crime, however officers quickly build up a wealth of evidence against him and today justice has been done.' Downer, of Moss Side, was found guilty of attempted murder following a trial at Manchester Crown Court . After the shooting the victim was bundled into a car and driven to hospital where he had emergency surgery and survived his ordeal.

"The iPhone 6 won't be in the hands of consumers until Friday, but Apple-obsessed Americans can now rest easy knowing the long-awaited electronics have arrived stateside. Or so says a pilot who's taken photos upon landing in Alaska of what he claims are mounds of the coveted devices in his plane's cargo hold. They're all bound up for safe keeping during the flight over from China, but according to the pilot there are plenty to go around. They're stateside! A pilot posted to the Apple-lover's forum MacRumors.com this picture of himself alongside a trove of new iPhones after landing in Anchorage en route from China . 'I just flew 195,000 iPhone 6 & 6+ from China to US,' the pilot, under the username goforblacksky, wrote on the web forum MacRumors on Monday. For fellow posters who thought that didn't sound like enough of the wildly popular phones, the pilot offered some reassurance. 'Believe me, this is not the only airplane hauling stuff. I'm guessing about 20 - 30 heavy's a day coming out of China,' he wrote. 'Another crew will take the airplane on to Chicago. It'll be on the ground at O'hare about 9am Sept. 15.' Another photo posted on the forum showed a plane being loaded up in China with iPhones. A search for the tail number of that plane indicated the aircraft has crisscrossed from several cities in China to Germany, Austria, Los Angeles, Chicago as well as Alaska and others over the last several days. The pilot even made a joke for the particularly eager.

On the inside: The photos taken by MacRumors commenter goforblacksky quickly became nearly as coveted as the new iPhones, which become available Friday . Apple Inc said many customers will need to wait until next month for their new iPhones after a record 4 million first-day pre-orders were logged, double the number for the iPhone 5 two years ago. The company said demand had outstripped supply of the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which feature larger screens and longer battery life. Deliveries of pre-orders will begin on Friday and will continue through October. Bumper first-day pre-orders point to first-weekend sales of up to 10 million units, analysts estimated. About 2 million pre-orders were received for the iPhone 5 in the first 24 hours after it went on sale in September 2012. Apple sold 5 million of these phones in the first weekend. Apple sold 9 million iPhone 5Ss and 5Cs, which were launched last year, in the first three days in stores. The company did not reveal pre-order numbers for these phones. Raymond James analysts said they expect sales of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus to top 9 million in the first weekend. The company routinely grapples with iPhone supply constraints, particularly in years that involve a smartphone re-design. The company said the new iPhone models will be available to customers in its stores in the United States, Canada, Australia and some other countries on Friday morning. AT&T Inc, Sprint Corp, T-Mobile US Inc, Verizon Wireless and some Apple authorized resellers will also start selling the phones on Friday. Source: Reuters . 'I gave it a little extra gas coming over the Pacific, just to get them here a little quicker. You're welcome.' The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will be delivered to customers starting Friday and throughout September, but many won't be delivered until October, Apple said. Phones will still be available Friday on a walk-in basis at Apple retail stores and from various wireless carriers and authorized Apple resellers. Apple's website had intermittent outages last Friday because of heavy traffic as orders began online. The company said the 4 million orders set a new 24-hour record, beating the 2 million orders in 2012. That was for the iPhone 5, the previous time Apple increased the iPhone's screen size. Last year, Apple sold 9 million iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c phones in the first three days they were on sale, but the company didn't say how many came in the first 24 hours of advance orders.

Aftermath: A suicide bomber detonated a Toyota Corolla loaded with explosives in the middle of a military convoy, injuring at least 20 and killing 7, including two Americans . The attack took place just after 8:00 a.m., when a Toyota Corolla loaded with explosives was driven into a convoy and detonated across from the U.S. embassy in Kabul, according to Agence France-Presse. It was rush hour, and dozens of Afghan civilians were caught in the blast. The 27-year-old captain of Afghanistan's national rugby, Sayed Mustafa Saadat, happened to be nearby. 'I rushed to help survivors. I picked up a local man who had a broken leg and was badly burnt,' he told AFP. 'I carried him all the way to the hospital, running,' he added. 'It took about 10 minutes, but I don't know if he survived.' Taliban spokesman Abdulqahar Balkhi said the group was responsible for the attack, tweeting that a 'powerful explosion destroyed 1 military vehicle, killing/wounding a number of American terrorists.'

The watch became Eisenhower's favourite and two years after receiving it he wore it into the White House where he was appointed the 34th President. Just before his death in 1969, Eisenhower gave the Rolex Oyster Perpetual DateJust watch to his long-serving aide Sergeant John Moaney, who had been by his side during the war. He had also lived in the White House with him. The watch was engraved with Eisenhower's initials and was the 150,000th made by Rolex .

"Tribunal: Dr Arun Singhal, 65, allegedly told a depressed woman patient in Huyton, Liverpool , that he would only sign a sick note for her if she paid for it . A FAMILY doctor stunned a suicidal patient by telling her: ‘You can go and jolly well do it now,’ a medical tribunal was told. Dr Arun Singhal, 65, is said to have twice advised the woman to kill herself during medical consultations, adding: ‘If you don’t know how to do it, it’s on the internet.’ The GP is also said to have told the patient she was a ‘disgrace’ and even added a false entry on her records claiming she had threatened to kill him. The distraught patient used a mobile phone to secretly record some of his comments during one of the consultations and he is now facing a disciplinary hearing. Yesterday she sobbed as she recalled how she had to gasp for breath when her family doctor advised her to kill herself during a row at his surgery. The woman, who is in her 30s, had warned Singhal she was contemplating suicide after learning she was to be called to give evidence as a witness in a rape trial. She was concerned that some of her neighbours were involved in the case. The hearing listened to the recording of their conversation in which the doctor refused to give her a sick note excusing her from appearing in court unless she paid him privately. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester was told the incidents took place over two consultations in 2011 after the woman – known as Patient A – registered with Singhal’s surgery. She had suffered various mental health issues and had initially gone to see Singhal claiming her anti-depressant medication was not working and she was feeling suicidal. As she was leaving the surgery in Huyton, Liverpool, she thought she heard the doctor urging her to commit suicide, saying: ‘You should go home and kill yourself.’ She told the hearing: ‘At the time I was feeling really depressed and it wasn’t until I got home that I thought, I’m sure he told me to go and kill myself when he patted me.’ A further consultation was booked in December 2011 after Patient A was asked to give evidence in the rape trial and she decided to record the meeting in sceret. In the recording played to the hearing, the doctor and Patient A are heard arguing about the sick note, before she said: ‘I’m going to commit suicide.’ The doctor replied: ‘You can go and jolly well do it now; if you don’t know how to do it, it’s on the internet.’ Surgery: The woman, who was on antidepressants, taped her appointment with Dr Singhal in Huyton, Liverpool . She said: ‘You’re my doctor and you’re telling me to kill myself? I’m suicidal!’ The doctor replied: ‘You are trying to blackmail me. If you are suicidal, you should go and do it.’ The woman then called him ‘a disgrace of a doctor’, and he said: ‘You’re a disgrace to be a patient.’ Asked why she had taped the second consultation, she said: ‘I was feeling very suicidal. ‘I knew he had said it to me previously. I thought he might say it again.’ Singhal is also accused of failing to include a reference to the woman’s expression of suicidal intent in her patient notes and even added a false entry claiming she had threatened to kill him. Boyd Morwood, for the General Medical Council, said: ‘Quite clearly, if the doctor is found to have said these words to Patient A, the GMC’s case is that this would be an abrogation of his position of trust, present a danger to Patient A because of her vulnerable position and undermine her trust in the profession.’ The hearing, which is expected to last five days, is going ahead in the doctor’s absence after the panel heard he did not wish to take part.

"A new season and with it comes new battles, both on the pitch and in the studios. In much the same way as clubs have fought for talent, the major TV channels have been battling for the best punditry talent. Alan Hansen’s retirement has left a void at the BBC and Paul Scholes’s arrival is being perceived as a major coup for BT. How will they fare in the shake-up? Here, Sportsmail runs the rule over the punditry teams that will be discussing the action this season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Adrian Chiles make controversial jokes about Polish on-air . Assistant: England assistant manager Gary Neville has been a revelation since joining Sky as a pundit . SKY . Star men: Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher, Graeme Souness, Jamie Redknapp, Jeff Stelling . Sky still represent the gold standard in punditry, with Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher, Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp offering by far the best and most detailed analysis of football. Neville and Carragher, in particular, have formed an excellent and occasionally combative partnership on Monday Night Football – ‘no one grows up wanting to be a Gary Neville’ – and Ed Chamberlin does an excellent job in steering those discussions. Souness has retained greater punditry authority than just about every other player from his generation, not least because he is willing and able to criticise. The organisation continue to lead the way in terms of technology, succeeding far more adequately than the rest in explaining how a goal was scored, rather than simply describing what happened. The fact that Sky have made compelling viewing of Jeff Stelling and a group of ex-pros watching TV only supports the notion that they are the most creative and effective at what they do. Of course they stand on a bigger platform than the rest, but they press home the advantage well, only losing a modicum of credit for their understandable yet irritating over-marketing of the weaker matches. Rating: 9/10 . MNF: Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville are the benchmark for punditry on Monday Night Football . End of an era: Alan Hansen's MOTD career spanned three decades, Alan Shearer will stay on . BBC . Star men: Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Martin Keown, Robbie Savage . The frequent and increasingly popular criticisms of the BBC are harsh, with Match of the Day rightly retaining iconic status in an era of dedicated channels and blanket coverage. But has been left behind by Sky and BT are growing rapidly. In spite of the challenges it faces in a ballooned market, it still offers a fine service. In Gary Lineker, they have arguably the best anchor of all, while Martin Keown is one of the few former players who can match the Sky group for analysis. Danny Murphy is also excellent at explaining the game, but overall the BBC lack the dynamism of Carragher and Neville. Perhaps it’s time to lose the chairs. Alan Shearer continues to get generous allocations for contributions that rarely offer significant insight, though he is improving. And Robbie Savage is more eloquent and sharper than his class clown image. The BBC have taken strides to freshen the image of its football such as filtering in some new faces like Murphy, who should get more airtime, but still lag some way behind Sky. Rating: 8/10 . Poor relation: Phil Neville was a commentator and pundit for BBC during the World Cup, it didn't go well . Old and new: Graeme Souness is an old-hand at punditry but Paul Scholes is relatively new on the scene . ITV . Star men: Adrian Chiles, Lee Dixon, Paul Scholes . ITV retain the ultimate love-or-hate anchor in Chiles. To some he is simply unbearable, for reasons largely lost on this reporter. To others, he is recognised as a professional broadcaster from a broadcaster’s background who tries to inject a modicum of humour into the dreadfully serious world of football. Dixon is a superb analyst and supplements the broadcasts, but Roy Keane’s return to coaching will be a blow, not least because of the absence of his aggression. The will-he, won’t-he saga over the possibility of a punch to Adrian Chiles has now all but disappeared. Signing Scholes for Champions League matches is also a major coup. Scholes’s open criticisms of Jack Wilshere, Wayne Rooney and Manchester United have stunned viewers of his panel work and readers of his Paddy Power blog. Rating: 7/10 . Marmite: People seem to either love or hate Adrian Chiles, seen here trying to cool down in Brazil . BT Sport . Star men: Jake Humphrey, Paul Scholes, Jose Mourinho, Rio Ferdinand . Humphrey is an excellent anchor and around him a solid team is starting to develop. Signing Scholes from under Sky’s clutches was a brilliant coup, while Jose Mourinho will do sporadic work and is always box office. The Chelsea boss will be able to appear in competitions which Chelsea no longer feature in, which could mean next month’s Community Shield between Arsenal and Manchester City. Rio Ferdinand is not to everyone’s  taste, but he speaks from a position of tremendous authority on the current game and is improving. What excites most is that BT are doing something different, not only in the sense that they offer a wider coverage than the terrestrial channels, but also in their studio gimmicks. While the BBC have their sofa, BT will get Owen Hargreaves and David James to deliver a free-kick masterclass on their indoor studio pitch. It’s a bit clunky, but early days… . Rating: 7.5/10 . New kids on the block: BT Sport with Jake Humphreys, Michael Owen, Steve McManaman and David James .

Subs not used: Bialkowski, Bajner, Bru, Henshall . Goals: Tesche (63), Antonio (90) It was a superb solo effort from the 31-year-old who glided down the right flank and cut in past both Eric Lichaj and Kelvin Wilson before curling the ball into the corner of the net. The Irish midfielder had already served Forest notice of his threat heading an early effort straight at Karl Darlow before bursting into the box and onto Connor Sammon’s flick and blasting over the bar in 12th minute. Forest had their chances to take the lead prior to Town’s opener with Matty Fryatt the main danger. He missed out on a golden opportunity when teammate Britt Assombalonga took Chris Burke’s cross off his toes. A minute later the ball did drop for Fryatt three yards out but he struck the post. After quarter of an hour Ipswich left back Tyrone Mings made a vital tackle to stop Assombalonga in the visitors’ area and from the resulting corner Fryatt headed wide from close range. The free flowing football continued into the second half with both sides pushing forward in search of goals. Jonny Williams, making his first start for the Tractor Boys in his second loan spell their from Crystal Palace, looked impressive. His persistence was impressive in winning one corner and minutes later Henri Lansbury ended another of his runs with a clumsy tackle that earned him a booking.

At the other end Dean Gerken made a fantastic reflex save low to his right to beat out Michail Antonio’s snap shot from Jack Hunt’s cross. But the Ipswich stopper was powerless to keep out then Forest equaliser soon afterwards. Lansbury floated a corner kick to the far post where German midfielder Robert Tesche rose unopposed to head powerfully home for his first Forest goal. Forest could have taken the lead when Chris Burke’s wicked shot curled just wide instead it was Murphy who struck again. Mings played a neat one-two with Tabb and whipped in an inviting ball that Murphy nodded home from close range. The home side could have struck straight back but Christophe Berra cleared Antonio’s effort off the line before a flying Gerken denied Assombalonga from the rebound. But Antonio was not to be denied and deep into stoppage time another Lansbury corner went to the far post and he powered home a header.

"Taxi drivers have proposed ten new road signs for Britain’s cities - including warnings about potholes, rickshaws and school run congestion zones. They have also identified ten senseless signs they say should be scrapped such as warnings about horse-drawn vehicles and migratory toads on roads. And Highway Code updates that cabbies suggest include bans on texting, wearing killer heels and relying on Google Maps while driving. Warning: London taxi drivers have proposed ten new road signs for Britain's cities - including warnings about potholes, rickshaws and school run congestion zones . Distraction: The drivers questioned said they want road signs put in place to warn them of pedestrians texting while crossing the road . Nearly 600 London black cab drivers - famous for their forthright views - were asked about new ways of improving road safety. An overwhelming 79 per cent wanted the minimum driving age upped to 18 and more than half, 56 per cent, think new drivers should face a night time curfew. Nearly three quarters, 73 per cent, think elderly drivers should have to re-sit their test at the age of 70, while 55 per cent want jaywalking, or wreckless road crossing by pedestrians, made illegal in the UK, as it is in the US. Hazard: Taxi drivers said that pedestrians should remove their headphones before crossing the road . Suggestions: The cabbies put forward 10 new road signs, including warnings about bicycles, middle-aged men in Lycra and congestion outside schools . When it comes to new road signs, six in ten want one warning of ‘Craters Ahead’ to be put on badly potholed roads, while more than half, 52 per cent, would like to see a warning of ‘Rickshaws clogging up road’ in areas like London’s West End where they slow down traffic. And middle-aged men in Lycra fell foul of 24 per cent of the questioned cabbies, who declared the cyclists to be such a menace that they required a dedicated warning sign. After a spate of deaths of cyclists on . London’s roads, 36 per cent want to see a ‘Bicycles turning’ warning . sign introduced, while around a third suggested that warnings about . pedestrians wearing headphones could be introduced. Other suggestions included warnings about congestion near schools, a 'Caution Tourist Area' sign, and a sign to encourage mobile users to pay more attention to traffic. Unnecessary: The drivers also wanted to see the back of outdated signs, including warnings of horse drawn vehicles in the road . The final proposal from 21 per cent is that there should be a single, consistent design - a red circle with a red slash through the picture - when something is outlawed, and to avoid confusion, they said that the current alternative ‘No’ design - a red circle containing a picture - should be scrapped. Taxi drivers said they also wanted to ditched the 'horse drawn vehicles likely to be on the road’ as they believe it is outdated, and 57 per cent want to do away with ‘migratory toad crossing’, as they cabbies think stopping for toads would cause accidents. They survey, carried out by black cab app Hailo, also asked drivers how they would like to update the Highway Code, with 72 per cent calling for a ban on texting or social media updates while driving, and 58 per cent asking for an instruction not to stop when pulled over by police until it is safe to do so. Congestion: The drivers complained that tourists and rickshaws both caused traffic hold-ups . Driving in heels over three inches in height should be banned, according to 44 per cent, and 38 per cent want to see driving barefoot outlawed. A warning against relying on Google Maps as a satellite navigation tool is proposed by 36 per cent.Safety suggestions cabbies have for pedestrians include avoiding using their mobiles while crossing roads (cited by 75 per cent), always getting out of cars curb-side (63 per cent) and removing headphones before crossing roads (63 per cent). Hailo founder Russell Hall said: 'Cabbies have their fingers on the pulse when it comes to road safety - they are an authority on city streets. The knowledge: Russell Hall, founder of black cab app Hailo, said taxi drivers had been asked for their views on road safety because they are an authority on city streets . 'It’s important that we stop and take the time to reassess road safety and what works for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers alike to ensure we move with the times. 'The new road signs address modern day life. 'Potholes are a common gripe of all drivers and something to be wary of on UK roads. 'Similarly, much more attention needs to be paid to cyclists on the road. 'Lifestyles play a huge part too from the school run drop off to the increased number of people carrying technology such as headphones and mobiles these days.'","More than 600 London taxi drivers quizzed on safety improvements .

"A mother who five-month-old baby was crushed to death on a baggage carousel at a Spanish airport has taken her case to court. Nathania Terry from Maryland watched in horror as her daughter Vashti Terry was killed last year at Alicante Airport. Ms Terry is now suing Netherlands-based Industries, a global supplier of luggage handling systems for airports and parcel and postal carriers. Nathania Terry from Maryland (right) watched in horror as her daughter Vashti Terry (left) was killed last year at Alicante Airport . She is seeking punitive damages for wrongful death, negligence, design defects and failure to warn, reports Court House News. Ms Terry had just landed in Spain in September 2013 after flying with her two children - Vashti and an older boy. 'Upon arrival in Alicante, Spain, Ms. Terry ushered her children toward the baggage claim,' the complaint states. 'Vashti was sitting in her car seat. Ms. Terry placed Vashti's car seat on a non-moving, or stationary, belt while she reached to retrieve Vashti's stroller from the end of the belt. The little girl was crushed in the gap, seen center, between two moving parts of the carousel . Her head reportedly became crushed between the two parts as her mother looked on helplessly . 'The belt suddenly and without warning turned on, throwing Vashti into a crevice where two different conveyor belts abutted. 'Ms. Terry frantically tried to rescue Vashti, but her efforts were unsuccessful. Five-month old Vashti was crushed to death on Sept. 18, 2013.' Ms Terry claims the conveyor belts at the airport, designed and manufactured by Vanderlande, had sensors that activated them when they detected objects. She says that when she put her daughter's car-seat on the belt it then started and there was no way to stop the conveyor and no warning about activating sensors. Vashti Terry was killed last year at Alicante Airport (pictured) Spanish authorities said in a statement last year that the luggage carousel complied with safety standards. In a statement, authorities insisted the machine was not to blame for the tragedy and that the luggage carousel adhered to legal standards. It was 'not attributable to the installation [of the machine], designed for the passage of luggage and not for the movement of people... It was due to neglect of those who were in charge of the child'.","Nathania Terry watched in horror as daughter Vashti Terry was killed .

"David Cameron clashed with the new Pope yesterday over his claims that the Falkland Islands had been ‘usurped’ by the British. Pope Francis, the former Cardinal of Buenos Aires, believes the South Atlantic territories are ‘Argentine soil’. But the Prime Minister said yesterday that he ‘respectfully’ disagreed with him and called on him to accept the result of the recent Falklands referendum. Scroll down for video . Vocal: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured right today at a press conference in Brussels, today said he disagreed with the new pope, Francis I, pictured left at a Mass this morning, over the Falkland Islands . Referring to the method used in the . Vatican to denote that a new Pope has been elected, Mr Cameron said: ‘As . it were, the white smoke over the Falklands was pretty clear.’ His intervention threatens to undermine relations between Britain and the Holy See just days after Pope Francis took over. Asked about the Pontiff’s views on . the Falklands at an EU summit in Brussels  yesterday, he said: ‘Well I . don’t agree with him – respectfully obviously. New role: Pope Francis prepares to greet cardinals - but it's his comments that the Falklands are 'Argentinian soil usurped by the British' which have garnered as much attention by the British government . The newly appointed Pope Francis stumbled after . being introduced to the College of Cardinals, and his comments on the Falklands have appeared to have given the bumps to David Cameron . ‘There was a pretty extraordinarily . clear referendum in the Falkland Islands and I think that is a message . to everyone in the world that the people of these islands have chosen . very clearly the future they want. ‘And that choice should be respected by everybody.’ The white smoke is a reference to the voting procedure at the papal conclave in the Vatican. After each vote, black smoke emerges from a chimney if no result has been reached. White smoke means a Pope has been chosen. New job: Pope Francis is greeted by Cardinal Timothy Dolan as he meets the Cardinals for the first time . One friend: Pope Francis is greeted by Cardinal Angelo Sodano at a meeting in the Vatican - but British PM David Cameron appears not to have got off on the best footing with the Pontiff . Pope Francis was elected on Wednesday . night after several rounds of voting, just days after the residents of . the Falklands voted 99.8 per cent in favour of remaining a British . dependency. Only three people voted against the . idea of remaining British. Nevertheless, the vote was still rejected as a . publicity stunt by Argentinian president Cristina Kirchner. In 2010, the Pope, as Cardinal of Buenos Aires, declared: ‘The Malvinas are ours’. Controversy: Pope Francis delivered a speech today as he met the Cardinals for the first time after his election, at the Vatican . The Argentinian Pope Francis has sparked with Kirchner in the past over Gay marriage and implied that women should not hold office . And during a Mass last year to mark . the 30th anniversary of the war, he said: ‘We come to pray for those who . have fallen, sons of the homeland who set out to defend his mother, the . homeland, to claim the country that is theirs and they were usurped.’ Argentina regards the Falklands as their territory even though Britain took control before Argentina existed as a nation. They say the population is implanted, . even though Argentina’s population is mainly descended from Spanish . settlers who largely wiped out the native Americans.' Unanimous verdict: Islanders celebrated late into the night after the referendum in Port Stanley, Falkland Islands, meant only three votes out of 1,517 were cast against the islands remaining British . Kirchner maintains that the Falklands are Argentina's land. Pictured, the 40 Commando, Royal Marines in  Port Howard, West Falkland during the war . Argentine soldiers, still with their weapons, waiting to be moved from Port Stanley airport shortly  after the surrender of the Falkland Islands to the British force. No fear: Then archbishop of Buenos Aires, Jorge Bergoglio, now Pope Francis, washing feet of drug addicts at a rehabilitation center to addicts in a shantytown of Buenos Aires . Cleansing: Pope Francis, pictured washing the feet of Aids victims - it will be interesting to see how he plans to approach the subject as he takes over as the head of the Catholic Church . With the people: Pope Francis during the inauguration of a chapel at a shanty town in Buenos Aires - he asked for people to donate money to charity rather than pay to see his inauguration in Rome .

"An SAS counter-terrorist rescue team is primed and ready to deploy on a mission to fly into Syria and rescue British hostage David Haines as soon as his location has been pinpointed. The team,  based a few hours' away in Cyprus, will be whisked into the war-torn country as soon as Britain's intelligence agencies are confident they have located the aid worker kidnapped by ISIS and David Cameron gives the go-ahead for them to go in. The Director of Special Forces, a British major general, has already briefed the Prime Minister on the likely success of a rescue operation and the dangers to troops being inserted into what is arguably the most dangerous country on earth. Scroll down for video . The target: David Haines was kidnapped 18 months ago from a refugee camp where he was working inSyria (pictured at home with daughter Athea Lilith) It comes after US commandos failed earlier this summer in an attempt to rescue 44-year-old Mr Haines - along with executed American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff - as the hostages had been moved by the jihadist fighters before they were able to get to them. The UK's secret intelligence service MI6, Arabic experts at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham and the SAS are working together in a race against time to establish Mr Haines's location before the terrorists carry out their threat to execute him - and to reach him before he is moved once again. The first priority is to obtain 'proof of life', and officials will be working on the assumption that Mr Haines is still alive because ISIS has not released a video of his execution. But intelligence sources believe that the Scottish aid worker, who was kidnapped from a refugee camp in Atmeh, northern Syria 18 months ago, is being moved relatively frequently from one safe house to another. Race against time: This video grab shows a masked militant threatening to kill Mr Haines. The first priority - before sending in the SAS - is to obtain 'proof of life', and officials will be working on the assumption that Mr Haines is still alive because ISIS has not released a video of his execution . Ready to go: The team, based a few hours' away in Cyprus, will be whisked into the war-torn country by Chinook helicopter as soon as Britain's intelligence agencies are confident they have located the aid worker (stock image of British Royal Marines on a mission in Iraq in 2002) Firepower: A Special Forces AC-130 gunship may be used for air support during the mission . Hard to track: Mr Haines was abducted in Atmeh, northern Syria, but intelligence sources believe the Scottish aid worker is being moved relatively frequently from one safe house to another . So the first stage in any rescue operation is the 'find' - potentially the most difficult phase - before the hostage's location is 'fixed'. The SAS will need to know the exact room of the house in the street of the city, town or village, where he is being held. They will need to know how many terrorists are on guard, their weapons and where the closest reinforcements are based. With this level of intelligence they can begin to fine tune the plan and start the number crunching process, which will deliver the number of troops and the assets, such as helicopters and combat air support and medical staff, needed to deliver a successful operation. One of the greatest intelligence gathering assets at the SAS's disposal is the RAF Sentinel R1 spy plane, inside which is a bewildering array of gadgetry supposedly capable of 'seeing inside buildings' and intercepting mobile phone calls. But the real hardcore information will come from human sources, disaffected members of ISIS ready to deal with either MI6 or the CIA. It is their information, which is likely to pinpoint the 'fix' - the exact location to within a matter of yards of the hostage's location . Once the 'fix' has been established, the extraction begins. Hellfire: They will have air support from Predator drones armed with Hellfire missiles and 500lb bombs, and RAF Tornados based in Cyprus . High tech: One of the greatest intelligence gathering assets at the SAS's disposal is the RAF Sentinel R1 spy plane, inside which is a bewildering array of gadgetry supposedly capable of 'seeing inside buildings' and intercepting mobile phone calls . Last leg: Ground crew prepare a Royal Air Force (RAF) Tornado GR4 fighter bomber at RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, where Haines will likely be taken back to should the mission prove a success . A squadron-sized SAS force, around 90 to 100 troopers, supported by members of the Special Forces Support Group, will insert into the target area and begin the actual rescue. They will fly over to Syria - or Iraq if he has been moved across the border - in Black Hawk or heavier duty Chinook helicopters. This is the crucial phase and where the element of surprise is vital. The operation will be launched at night during the very early hours, before the first muslim prayers of the day. They will have air support from Predator drones armed with Hellfire missiles and 500lb bombs, and RAF Tornados based in Cyprus. If Americans are assisting the mission there could also be support from US Air Force AC130 Spectre gunships, which are equipped with a 30mm cannon, a 40mm Bofors auto-cannon, missiles and bombs. From the moment of 'contact' with the enemy, the SAS may have just minutes to rescue Mr Haines and other hostages. The SAS will be equipped with sniper rifles, US Special operations assault rifles, grenade launchers, pistols, stun grenades, silenced weapons, night vision goggles and real-time video satellite-linked to a ground operations room in a safe location - like that used when President Obama watched the US special forces mission to kill Osama Bin Laden. The SAS will assume that the guards could be wearing suicide vests and under orders to kill the hostages at the first sign of trouble. The 'find, fix, extraction' mission does not allow for prisoners being taken, so the capture of the militant 'Jihadi John' who executed Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff - and who threatened Mr Haines in the video released this week - will not be a priority. Not a priority: The 'find, fix, extraction' mission does not allow for prisoners being taken, so the capture of the militant 'Jihadi John', pictured moments before he beheaded U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff will not be a priority . Once the hostages have been freed the exfiltration process begins. This will involve moving as quickly as possible to a secure and heavily defended rendezvous point, where the SAS and the hostages can be flown out of the target area via helicopter to a safe location, probably Cyprus. Once back at a British base, Mr Haines would be flown back to the UK, if necessary on a specially equipped medical flight. The key to any military operation is simplicity. The more working parts the greater the risk of mistakes. The failure of Operation Eagle Claw, the botched US special forces mission to rescue American citizens imprisoned in the US Embassy in Iran in 1980, still lives long in the memory of all special forces units. Even today the SAS's working mantra is 'if it can go wrong, it will go wrong'. Consequently all plans are based around that assumption. And while the SAS see it as their duty to 'risk all' in attempting to rescue a British hostage, the Government is likely to be more cautious with senior advisers assessing the 'cost and benefits' of a raid, with the obvious fear being mission failure could see members of the SAS killed or, even worse, captured.","The SAS team is awaiting orders in Cyprus to rescue David Haines in Syria .

"President Barack Obama insisted on Wednesday that he would not send ground troops into Iraqi combat zones to fight the ISIS terrorist army, directly contradicting his top general who said a day earlier that the president asked him for boots-on-the-ground recommendations 'on a case-by-case basis.' In a gymnasium full of servicemen and women at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, Obama seemed also to push back against the political battering he's taken in recent days, making broad claims of America's greatness while he's at the helm. 'I want to be clear,' he said, 'The American forces that have been deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission. They will support Iraqi forces on the ground as they fight for their own country against these terrorists.' 'As your commander-in-chief,' Obama insisted, 'I will not commit you and the rest of our armed forces to fighting another ground war in Iraq.' Scroll down for videos . Smartphone generation: Soldiers scrambled for digital souvenirs as Obama took the stage Wednesday at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa . The president insisted that he won't put combat boots on the ground in Iraq to fight the ISIS terror army . InstaPOTUS: Obama posed behind a soldier as she took a selfie before his speech in Tampa . On Tuesday, however, Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told lawmakers that circumstances on the ground could drive him to push for American combat troops to be embedded with Iraqi army units. 'If we reach the point where I believe our advisers should accompany Iraqi troops on attacks against specific ISIL targets,' Dempsey said, using an alternative name for the terror group, 'I will recommend that to the president.' Dempsey was testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Asked by New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte whether the president had ruled out the use of American ground forces in a combat role, Dempsey responded, 'Yes. But he has told me as well to come back to him on a case-by-case basis.' He said that if needed, he 'would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of ground forces.' But on Wednesday Obama was single-minded, dismissing all thoughts of putting U.S. troops in the path of incoming fire. American forces are currently limited to an advisory role, which includes direct contact with Iraqi command centers. 'We'll use our air power,' Obama assured his audience of soldiers, drawing his boundaries. 'We will train and equip our partners. We will advise them and we will assist them. We will lead a broad coalition of countries who have a stake in this fight.' Citing both the Iraq conflict and the emergence of a new Ebola virus epidemic in west Africa, Obama emphasized what he said were 'America's unique abilities and responsibilities to lead.' On Monday night the White House announced a deployment of 3,000 ground troops and Army engineers to intervene in Liberia, a country that has already seen more than 2,400 diagnosed cases and 1,300 deaths from the disease. Mobbed: The youngest servicemen and women clamored to shake Obama's hand and snap photos of the commander-in-chief . Stars in their eyes: Servicewomen wore broad smiles as Obama spoke about American greatness . 'It is America that has the unique capability to mobilize against an organization like ISIL,' he said. 'In a world full of broader social challenges, it is America that has the unique capability and know-how to help contain and combat a threat like Ebola.' And underscoring his mop-up approach to diplomacy and his renewed emphasis on international aid payments, Obama said the world is still reliant on the U.S. to help solve its largest problems. 'That's the story, across the board,' he said. 'If there is a hurricane, if there is a typhoon, if there is some sort of crisis, if there is an earthquake, if there is a need for a rescue mission, when the world is threatened and the world needs help, it calls on America.' 'Even the countries that complain about America: When they need help, who do they call? They call on us.' 'And then,' he told his military audience, 'America calls on you.' The president's biggest applause line: 'Our reach is long. If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven. We will find you eventually' Awkward moment: Silence took over when the president boasted that American troops would be pulled out of Afghanistan at year's end . Contradiction: Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a US Senate panel on Tuesday that Obama asked him to make ground-troop recommendations 'on a case-by-case basis' 'This is a moment of American leadership,' Obama said. 'And thanks to you, it is a moment that we are gonna meet.' Aside from his early roll call of the various armed services, Obama's biggest applause line was his direct threat to ISIS. 'Whether in Iraq or in Syria,' the president said, 'these terrorists will learn the same thing that leaders of al-Qaeda already know: We mean what we say.' 'Our reach is long. If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven. We will find you eventually.' Less popular was his triumphant statement to the servicemen and women that 'in three months, because of you, our combat mission will be over in Afghanistan and our war in Afghanistan will come to a responsible end.' Pausing for applause, Obama was met instead by silence – suddenly reminiscent of the tepid response he received during an August 26 speech to the American Legion. 'That's because of you,' he said again.","The US president spoke to servicemen and women at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida after a briefing from US Central Command staff .

"The Southwest United States was told to prepare for major flooding from Tropical Storm Odile beginning Wednesday a week after severe weather washed out a major interstate in Nevada. Odile passed over the Baja California peninsula Monday, flooding roadways and destroying homes with 110 mile per hour gusts, before turning northeast. Southwestern states were hit with flooding last week in the wake of Tropical Storm Norbert, as Phoenix experienced its wettest day on record with 3.29 inches of rainfall, Mashable reported. Scroll down for video . Rain clouds: Residents in Mesa, Arizona, took free sandbags to defend their property from floodwater ahead of Tropical Storm Odile . This came in the middle of a long drought year for the region, and the dry weather could spell disaster with the onset of sudden rain as Odile passes into the United States. An update from NOAA's National Hurricane Center Wednesday morning reported that rainfall of three to six inches could be expected, with up to nine inches in certain areas. AccuWeather meteorologist Ken Clark projected that 'there is the potential for devastating, catastrophic and historic flooding in this scenario.' The National Weather Service put flash flood watches into effect for significant portions of Arizona and New Mexico and parts of Southern California, Nevada and West Texas. 'Travel on Interstate-10 between El Paso, Texas, and Phoenix will be dangerous,' Clark said. Dry riverbeds also create conditions for flash floods to be increasingly dangerous. Historic: Rainfall in the region could potentially be higher than it was last week when Phoenix experienced its wettest day in the wake of Tropical Storm Norbert . Swept: Odile's winds were down to sustained gusts of 40 mph Wednesday morning after hitting speeds of 110 mph over Baja California . Residents in the regions expected to be worst hit began preparing for high water. 'It flooded my whole property, my horse pens, and my garage was under about,' Roger Fuller told the Associated Press. 'This time around, we're trying to keep the water off the property.' Odile's winds have calmed to 40 miles per hour, according to NOAA. The storm had sustained gusts of 110 miles per hour when it crashed through resort areas in Mexico's Baja California.

"Shane Geraghty booted a 78th-minute penalty to end London Irish's long wait for a win at the home of 10-times Premiership champions Leicester Tigers. The centre's easy kick earned the Irish a 22-19 win, their first Premiership victory at Welford Road since 2003, and also ended a run of 10 matches without a win in all competitions against Leicester. After Owen Williams kicked a massive 55-metre penalty to level the scores at 19-19 in the 70th minute, the match looked to be heading for a draw and a valuable two points for the Tigers after last week's thrashing at Bath. London Irish players celebrate their victory over the Leicester Tigers at Welford Road . But with time running out, referee Greg Garner awarded a controversial penalty which was greeted by boos from the Welford Road crowd. Geraghty kicked 17 points in all, Irish's solitary try coming from prop Halani Aulika, while Vereniki Goneva scored for Leicester. Freddie Burns added 11 points with the boot. Geraghty and Leicester number eight Jordan Crane both received yellow cards. Leicester boss Richard Cockerill hinted he might go into the transfer market after last week's record 45-0 defeat at Bath, due to an injury crisis that has robbed him of almost half his 45-man squad. He called on a side which again had an unfamiliar look to show some ""steel and backbone"" against an Irish side that had a shocking record at Welford Road. With first-choice centres Manu Tuilagi and Anthony Allen out, Goneva moved to outside centre, allowing winger Miles Benjamin to make his first start of the season. Flanker Kieran Low made his first start of the season for Irish who had much the better of a poor first half and turned round 13-6 up thanks to the try by prop Aulika and a conversion and two penalties from Geraghty. Shane Geraghty kicks the straight-forward penalty that won the match for the Exiles . Fly-half Freddie Burns kicked two penalties for Leicester but also missed two from long range. Geraghty put the Irish ahead with his first penalty in the fifth minute and five minutes later the visitors thought they had scored when Alex Lewington put fellow winger James Short over, only to see the try chalked off for obstruction by number eight Luke Narraway. Burns missed penalties either side of a successful one for Geraghty and it took a fine tackle by Leicester winger Blaine Scully to stop Blair Cowan scoring after the flanker had split the Tigers defence with a fine run from halfway. Cowan was lucky to escape a yellow card when he appeared to punch Leicester flanker Jamie Gibson during a melee, and after consulting the TMO the referee reversed the penalty he had given to Irish and warned Cowan and both captains. Leicester's Blaine Scully is tackled during their defeat at home to the Exiles . Burns finally put Leicester on the scoreboard with a 29th-minute penalty but they failed to collect the restart, Lewington plucking the ball out of the air and launching an attack that led to the visitors' try. After Lewington had been forced into touch just short of the line, Leicester messed up their line-out. The Irish however won theirs through former Tigers lock George Skivington and the forwards drove Aulika over for an easy try, which Geraghty converted. Geraghty, however, played little further part in the half. He was yellow-carded for handling in a ruck near his own posts, allowing Burns to slot an easy penalty. Irish fly-half Chris Noakes missed a long-range penalty and centre Fergus Mulchrone failed to capitalise on an interception on his own line, throwing a speculative pass into thin air just past halfway, near half-time. Eight minutes after the break Burns reduced the deficit with his third penalty. Kieran Low embraces Geraghty after he kicks the match-winning penalty for Irish . Aulika wasted a chance when knocking on within sight of the Leicester posts before Geraghty slotted another penalty to make it 16-9. Leicester equalised minutes later when Goneva caught the Irish napping, picking up at the base of a ruck and sprinting 15 metres to score while the Irish watched Ben Youngs organise his attackers. Burns kicked the conversion. Yet Geraghty put the Irish back in front again with another penalty after Crane had been sin-binned for dangerous play. Burns missed a long-range penalty and such was Leicester's desperation that centre Owen Williams then attempted one from five metres inside his own half - and it sailed over. But two minutes from time Burns clinched victory for Irish with a simple penalty after Mathew Tait had been penalised for handling on the floor.","London Irish's Shane Geraghty kicked penalty in the 78th minute to inflict a second successive loss on the Leicester Tigers .

"ISIS has released a slickly produced new video warning the United States of the carnage it wants to inflict in Iraq if President Obama deploys troops to the war-torn nation as he attempts to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the terror group. Resembling a blockbuster movie trailer, the disturbing 52-second video entitled 'Flames of War' shows militants blowing up tanks in dramatic slow motion, wounded US soldiers apparently being executed and the White House in the sights of a shaky camera. It then shows a clip of the president from before the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq saying that combat troops will never return to the Middle Eastern nation, before the video ends with a text overlay that reads, 'Flames of War -- fighting has just begun ... Coming soon.' Scroll down for video . Threatening: The video is widely seen as a response to the Obama administration's decision to consider deploying troops to Iraq . The video's timing, released yesterday, suggests it was a direct response to General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who told the Senate Armed Services Committee that fighting in Iraq may require the use of ground troops. The video was released by the al-Hayat Media Center, which has become known for its propaganda videos for ISIS which include high-production values, CGI explosions and slow motion footage. The video also appears to mock the United States by including an image of the infamous 'Mission Accomplished' banner that made an appearance on board USS Abraham Lincoln during George W. Bush's victory speech in 2003 following the US-led invasion of Iraq. President Bush's former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld also makes an appearance in the video, walking through Iraq during the occupation. Destruction: During the video ISIS soldiers are seen to unleash multiple and successful strikes on US troops and tanks in the Middle East . Blast: The video - which bears all the hallmarks of a highly produced Hollywood trailer shows the destruction of US military targets at the hands of ISIS . That image is then followed by a picture of the White House at night, filmed by a moving camera from what is presumably a car driving past. The movie is just the latest heavily edited video from ISIS, that has included gruesome footage of the beheadings of two American journalists and a British aid worker. General Dempsey told a U.S. Senate panel on Tuesday that American troops might soon provide Iraqi forces with 'close combat advising' in the fight against the ISIS terror army. That clarification of the Pentagon's mission in the Middle East could mean that U.S. soldiers and Marines are embedded with Iraqi army units, helping them conduct warfare. Heavily armed: New York City police officers stand guard in Times Square on September 17, 2014 in New York City. A blog affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) mentioned Times Square as a target for bombing . Slow motion: ISIS militants are seen to heroically survive American attacks and retaliate with superior force in the video . Gen. Martin Dempsey, who chairs the military's joint chiefs of staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the American military is currently serving a purely advisory role. But in certain circumstances, he said, they might provide 'close combat advising.' Citing a hypothetically urgent mission focused on 'retaking Mosul' as anti-war protesters provided frequent interruptions, he said he could envision U.S. troops 'accompanying that mission.' Asked by New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte whether the president has ruled out the use of American ground forces in a combat role, Dempsey responded, 'Yes. But he has told me as well to come back to him on a case-by-case basis.' He said that if needed, he 'would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of ground forces.' Mocking: The video attacks President George W. Bush's assertion in 2003 that the invasion of Iraq was completed . Ominous: The video shows a brief and shaky clip of a car driving past the White House filming it - clearly threatening the home of the US president . In his opening statement, he said that 'if we reach the point where I believe our advisers should accompany Iraqi troops on attacks against specific ISIL targets, I will recommend that to the president.' ISIL is an alternate name for ISIS. President Obama has maintained that American forces won't have a combat mission in Iraq. But Oklahoma Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe said Tuesday that he's not convinced the White House is true to its word. 'It will take an army to beat an army, but instead the President presented a limited counter-terrorism strategy,' Inhofe said during the hearing. 'His claim of ""no boots on the ground"" is an insult to the men and women in Iraq today who are serving in harm’s way. We already have boots on the ground in Irbil and in Baghdad and throughout Iraq.' Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey (right) said he might recommend inserting U.S. troops to 'accompany' Iraqis in combat situations, if airstrikes failed to neutralize ISIS . Protesters, from the far-left CODEPINK group, numbered at least 10 -- all of whom managed to get into the hearing room without a challenge from Capitol Police . Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel faced multiple questions from lawmakers in the first high-stakes hearing examining Obama's expanded military campaign to counter the relentless terrorist threat from Middle East extremists. The U.S. military conducted strikes near Baghdad against ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. ISIS has seized large swaths of Iraq and Syria. Obama is seeking congressional support to train and equip vetted Syrian moderates fighting both the Islamic militants and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Dempsey said the United States is prepared to strike Islamic targets in Syria. 'This will not look like ""shock and awe"" because that is not how ISIL is organized. But it will be persistent and sustainable,' Dempsey said, referring to the air bombardment at the start of the Iraq war in March 2003. Hagel seconded him. 'Because ISIL operates freely across the Iraqi-Syrian border, and maintains a safe haven in Syria, our actions will not be restrained by a border in name only,' he said. Doing Obama's bidding: Hagel, shown with the president after a Medal of Honor ceremony on Monday, is responsible for implementing his policies -- and taking blame if they fail or if 'mission creep' kicks in . Several lawmakers have their doubts about the United States being pulled into a larger war, with increasing numbers of American troops. The president has already dispatched more than 1,000 Americans three years after combat forces left Iraq. Many Republicans and Democrats have expressed reservations about the ability to identify moderates in a country awash with rebel formations and shifting alliances. The Islamic State grew out of the al-Qaeda movement, but the two are now fighting. In some instances, the moderate Free Syrian Army has teamed with al-Qaeda's local franchise, the Nusra Front. Hagel said the U.S. will monitor them closely to ensure that weapons don't fall into the wrong hands. 'There will always be risk in a program like this, but we believe that risk is justified by the imperative of destroying ISIL – and the necessity of having capable partners on the ground in Syria,' the defense secretary said. Anti-war protesters filled the front rows at the hearing, chanting 'No more war! No more war! No military solution!' at the start of the session and repeatedly interrupting testimony. 'War is not the answer!' one activist yelled as Hagel was introduced. Committee chairman Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, snapped. 'Would you please now leave? I'm asking you to please leave. You're acting very warlike yourself,' Levin told them. Hagel said the involvement will not be 'an easy or brief effort. We are at war with ISIL, as we are with al-Qaeda.'","ISIS release video threat to the United State on Tuesday entitled 'Flames of War'

"One of Silicon Valley's most successful investors has launched a scathing attack on Twitter, accusing the firm of 'a lot of pot smoking'. Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and early Facebook investor, also said the firm was 'horribly mismanaged.' in an interview with CNBC. 'Twitter is hard to evaluate, they have a lot of potential' he said before launching into a tirade. Scroll down for video . Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and early Facebook investor, also said Twitter was 'horribly mismanaged.' in an interview with CNBC. One Twitter investor responded to the claim by reminding Thiel of an early investstment, likening it to 'Waterworld'. In 2008 the Silicon Valley billionaire gave $1.25million to the Seasteading Institute, an organisation that aspires to launch a floating colony into international waters, freeing them and like-minded thinkers to live by libertarian ideals. Mr Thiel told Details magazine: 'The United States Constitution had things you could do at the beginning that you couldn't do later. So the question is, can you go back to the beginning of things? How do you start over?' The floating sovereign nations that Mr Thiel imagines would be built on oil-rig-like platforms anchored in areas free of regulation, laws, and moral conventions. 'It's a horribly mismanaged company-probably a lot of pot-smoking going on there,' he said. However, despite this, he claimed the firm could still succeed. 'But it's such a solid franchise it may even work with all that.' He also stopped short of calling for the Twitter CEO Dick Costolo to quit. 'I'm not sure they could do that much better. The CEO can't really change things that much in these companies. 'You'd have to fire everybody and start over.' Thiel, who does not own shares of Twitter, said the founders of the social media site set the tone for the company's culture and it's hard to change. 'One of the paradoxes is when you have a business model as good as Twitter-where you have 140 characters, no one can copy it, no one can compete-you can be screwing a lot of other stuff,' he said. The venture capital firm where he is a partner, Founders Fund, also takes a shot at Twitter in its manifesto, 'We wanted flying cars. Instead we got 140 characters.' Twitter did not have any immediate comment, but one early Twitter investor did. One investor bought up Thiel's backing of a 'Waterworld' project for a floating city. In a tweet, Jason Goldman pointed out Thiel has previously talked about plans to create an ocean platform to live on. 'Yo but how high were you when you decided to go live on an ocean platform. 'No not like. It *is* Waterworld man.' he said. Twitter did not have any immediate comment, but one early Twitter investor did-in a tweet, which Costolo responded to tongue-in-cheek . He also then asked Twitter CEO to retweet the comment as his official statement, which Costolo responded to tongue-in-cheek, saying 'working my way through a giant bag of Doritos. I'll catch up with you later.'
