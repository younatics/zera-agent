A driver has been jailed for four years after leaving his friend to die at the side of the road after he was thrown from his car in a head-on smash. James Maughan, 20, was driving a Suzuki 4x4 when he failed to stop at a road junction and smashed into an oncoming VW Golf. The impact caused his passenger Travis O’Neil, who was riding in the back without a seatbelt, to be thrown from the car. But as witnesses gathered to give 19-year-old Mr O’Neil first aid, Maughan reversed his 4x4 off a grass verge and drove away. Jailed: James Maughan, pictured left, has been sentenced to four years at a young offenders institution for causing the death of his friend Travis O'Neil, pictured right, by dangerous driving . Scene: Maughan was behind the wheel when he crashed his Suzuki 4x4 into a VW Golf in Sheffield. Mr O'Neil was in the backseat without a seat-belt and was thrown from the car . The 4x4, bought by Mr O’Neil earlier . that day, was later found burned out, prosecutor Michael Rawlinson told . Sheffield Crown Court. Mr O’Neil, whose girlfriend Chelsea Lynch was expecting a baby, was rushed to hospital but died from his injuries an hour later. In a victim impact statement read out in court Miss Lynch said: 'How am I going to explain to my daughter she has to grow up without a daddy?' Maughan was due to stand trial but changed his plea to guilty to causing death by dangerous driving last November. Mr Rawlinson told the court the junction was clearly marked but he went straight across, spun out of control and hit a road sign. Maughan, of no fixed address and who has a three-year-old daughter, claimed he abandoned the vehicle nearby and did not set it on fire. Serious injuries: Maughan fled the scene of the crash, leaving Mr O'Neil lying on the road. Witnesses called an ambulance but Mr O'Neil died an hour later in hospital . He handed himself in to police after a public appeal for information following the smash on Arbourthorne Road, Sheffield. He told police he blamed NHS support worker June Jones who was driving the Golf for the crash. The public gallery was packed as family and relatives of both Travis and Maughan waited for the sentence. Michael Blakey, defending, said: 'Travis was his close friend, he is devastated and it will live with him for the rest of his life. He apologises.' While awaiting the court case in July this year Maughan was jailed for 13 months for possessing an imitation offensive weapon. He also admitted assaulting a prison warder with a pan of hot water while in custody. Recorder David Gordon sent him to a young offenders’ institution for four years and banned him from driving for five years. He will serve at least half of his detention. The judge told him: 'You will have to live with this on your conscience for the rest of your life.'

With tomatoes at one end and potatoes at the other, it looks like the product of some Frankenstein food laboratory. But far from being the latest genetically modified monster, this horticultural wonder is entirely natural. Called the TomTato, each plant can yield more than 500 sweet cherry tomatoes as well as a decent crop of white potatoes. On sale: Thompson & Morgan worker Michael Perry with the TomTato plant sold by his company . It is produced using a hi-tech grafting process and was unveiled to the public yesterday before going on sale to gardeners in the UK for the first time. The project took a lot longer to bear fruit than the plant does, however. It began 15 years ago when Paul Hansord, horticultural director of mail order gardening company Thompson & Morgan, was on a trip to the US. He spotted a potato plant growing separately under a tomato plant and learned that it is possible to graft the two together because they belong to the same family. Hybrid: The 'TomTato' plant produces cherry tomatoes from its stem and potatoes from its roots . His problem was how to develop the idea so the plants could be sold commercially. The stumbling block had been how to produce tiny potato plants which have stems the same thickness as seedling tomatoes, so that the two can be joined together perfectly. But after a process of trial and error, and with the help of grafting specialists, Thompson & Morgan hit upon a method using a variety of potato that produces the right size shoot. Careful variations in the temperature at . which the tomato and potato are initially grown are also made to ensure . the two plants are a perfect match before being joined together. ‘At the start, we thought it’d just be a novelty thing to do. But as the trials developed we realised what we had produced was really high yield, had fantastic flavour and could be done commercially for the first time,’ Mr Hansord said yesterday. An exotic red lime that will give cocktails added colour and marmalade an extra tang has gone on sale in Britain. The red lime, pictured, thought to be a cross between a lemon and a mandarin, is native to India. The trees are being sold for £34.99 by Suttons Seeds of Devon and can be grown in a conservatory or on a patio. The firm says: ‘The peel is reddish-orange. The pulp has a limelike aroma and is a deep orange colour. They are very juicy.’ ‘It can be planted from late April and produces trusses full of tomatoes which have a traditional tangy, sweet flavour from July to October and a good hearty crop of potatoes of a versatile variety, which can be boiled, mashed, roasted or made into chips, for late in the season.’ Mr Hansord added: ‘Each TomTato plant is specially grafted by hand to create this unique double cropping feature. There’s no genetic modification – it’s an all-natural, and safe process.’ Production begins in a specialist laboratory in Holland, where the delicate grafting process takes place. The plants are then shipped back to the UK and grown on in greenhouses until they are big enough to be sold. The TomTato – which has been dubbed a ‘veg plot in a pot’ – can be grown inside or outside, in a large patio pot or 40-litre bag, on the allotment or in the vegetable patch, says Ipswich-based Thompson & Morgan. It is selling the 3.5in plants from next spring for £14.99 each, or two for £29.98 plus one free, via www.thompson-morgan.com or by phone on 0844 573 1818.","'TomTato' is made from two separate plants grafted together .

Plot: Dominic Di Chiera, 50, ordered thousands of pounds of expensive equipment on BBC accounts to embarrass his boss . A BBC technical operations manager used the corporation’s account to order nearly £8,000 worth of specialist electrical equipment during an act of 'revenge' against his manager after his contract was terminated. Former BBC News team leader Dominic Di Chiera, 50, sought to blow his boss’s budget to embarrass him at a time of severe staff cuts after finding out his contract wasn't being renewed. But his spending spree was picked up by his manager who tracked the orders back to Di Chiera who was then arrested. Australian-born Di Chiera pleaded guilty . to seven counts of fraud by false representation, namely fraudulently . using a BBC account to make purchase orders totalling £7,773.63 between . June 4 and 26. Di Chiera, who joined the beeb in January last year after fourteen years at Channel 4, was sentenced yesterday to a twelve-month community order with 200 hours community service work. He was also ordered to pay £1,000 compensation to the BBC. Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court heard how Di Chiera ordered a 3D Blu-ray player, LED televisions, a mobile phone, camera drive and other electrical items after finding out his contract wouldn't be renewed. Four items were recovered by police when they searched his matrimonial home in Battersea, London, but the court heard he hid the rest around the BBC building. Prosecutor Miss Louise Burnell told the court: 'Di Chiera was making fraudulent purchase orders for electrical equipment using the BBC account and having many of the items delivered to his home address.' The court heard how his manager, Huw Davies, noticed a suspicious order made on the BBC account just days before Di Chiera's contract was due to terminate on June 30. Caught out: Di Chiera's manager spotted a 'suspicious order' on the accounts and tracked it back to him . 'It was reported to an investigating . manager and the purchase order history revealed Mr Di Chiera had used . the account on behalf of the BBC and many orders were delivered to his . home address.' The court was told Di Chiera admitted the items had been delivered to his home and blamed the stress of his contract coming to an end for his 'silly' actions. The police were called and Di Chiera’s home was searched the same day and he was later questioned by officers. 'He said he had hidden many of the items within the BBC, but it is a mammoth task to search the building for them and the items have not been recovered.' Di Chiera told the probation service Mr Davies had put him under huge pressure and he was working sixteen-hour days at the BBC. He felt whatever he did was not sufficient to satisfy management and said the frauds were an act of 'revenge' to make his boss look bad by going over budget. Sentenced: Di Chiera was ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service after pleading guilty to seven counts of fraud at Hammersmith Magistrates Court . Di Chiera’s lawyer Juleun Lim told the court: 'None of these items were retained by him. He’s ordered them and they have been put back into circulation in the BBC stock. 'His motivation was to effect negatively his manager over the budget and make him look bad so that when the budget was reviewed there would be an overspend. 'His manager was treating him very unfairly and putting a tremendous amount of pressure on him and he likens it to being bullied. 'His work was good and when he was told his contract would not be renewed the pressure got to him and to use his words: ""I suffered a mental breakdown."" 'He is sorry he acted in the way that he did and he does wish to make amends. 'He is unemployed and actively seeking work in the same field.' Di Chiera was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. He was employed at a variety of BBC sites and has also worked for Channel 4 and BSkyB.","Dominic Di Chiera, 50, wanted to blow his boss's budget to embarrass him .

City dealers promised to send each other champagne, Ferraris and free curry as they rigged crucial interest rates. The details emerged yesterday as British broking giant ICAP was fined £54million by UK and US authorities over the so-called Libor scandal. Brokers spoke about lavishing each other with gifts as they helped to skew the interbank lending rate. Caught out: ICAP, founded by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, is the first broker to be fined for involvement in the Libor scandal . In emails between them, one dubbed . himself ‘Lord Libor’ and one ‘Lord Bailiff’ while another boasted: ‘As . for kickbacks etc we can discuss that at lunch’. ICAP . is the latest corporate giant to be hauled before regulators over the . global conspiracy. The company will pay fines totalling £54million after . being censured by a US  watchdog and Britain’s Financial Conduct . Authority. Three former brokers at the firm now also face criminal charges in the US and could each serve 30 years in jail. Britons . Daniel Wilkinson and Colin Goodman and New Zealand-based Darrell Read . are accused of ‘showing a cavalier disregard’ for the interests of the . markets. ICAP’s involvement . may also be embarrassing for Prime Minister David Cameron, who is an . ally of the firm’s boss Michael Spencer. Mr Spencer has donated around . £2.6million to the Conservative Party and worked as its Treasurer until . 2010. Last night Mr Cameron faced calls from Labour to hand the . donations back. Mr Spencer said he felt ‘an absolute sense of revulsion’ at the behaviour of his former staff but said he had not considered . resigning. ‘It becomes a . dangerous world if the head of a company has to take responsibility for . activities of which he has no knowledge at all in a big organisation,’ he said. Under pressure: The prosecution has sparked calls for David Cameron to hand over more than £4million of party donations from ICAP founder and former Tory party treasurer Michael Spencer . John Mann, the MP for Bassetlaw, has called for all previous donations from Michael Spencer and his company go to Armed forces charities . Regulators believe . that ICAP’s London brokers manipulated Libor for the Japanese yen to . help a trader from Swiss bank UBS make millions of dollars on financial . markets. Between 2006 and . 2011, ICAP’s brokers allegedly emailed ‘skewed’ suggestions to other . banks about what they thought the rate for the day should be. Some . banks were also urged to submit higher or lower rates based on which . way the UBS trader – confirmed by sources last night as Thomas Hayes – . was betting. In return, one . broker received £5,000 every three months in kickbacks, regulators said. In one email, a broker says: ‘Make 6m [six months] go lower! They r . going up. [Senior trader]will buy you a Ferrari next year if you move 3m . up and no change 6m’ All . three ICAP brokers at the centre of the scandal have been fired but . regulators said at least seven other ICAP staff participated in the . wrongdoing. UBS trader Hayes was earlier this year charged with eight counts of conspiracy to defraud by the Serious Fraud Office. Tracey . McDermott, director of enforcement at the FCA, said: ‘The misconduct in . relation to Libor has cast a shadow over the financial services . industry. ‘The findings we . publish today illustrate... individuals within the industry acting with a . cavalier disregard both for regulatory obligations and the interests of . the markets.’ Regulators . said lax controls by bank bosses enabled the conspiracy to go on for . years.

David Reynolds (pictured) was found guilty at City of London Magistrates Court of assault by beating after he broke a bouncer's nose in a row over a £500 bar bill at a five-star hotel . A City analyst who broke a bouncer’s nose in a row over a £500 bar bill at a five-star hotel, while claiming he was related the Queen, is facing jail after being convicted of assault today. David Reynolds, 31, punched Arza Daery after he was kicked out of the Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge following a three hour drinking session. City of London Magistrates Court heard his credit card was declined on December 18th due to a malfunction on the machine. Earlier, the court had heard how Reynolds launched into a foul-mouthed tirade against staff at the hotel then punching the bouncer. Reynolds had claimed staff had 'grossly over-reacted' and that he 'absolutely did not' hit the bouncer. However, he was convicted of one count of assault by beating by magistrates who found his drunken account less reliable than that of the two bouncers. Giving evidence, Mr Reynolds said: 'We had drunk quite a lot, we drunk more than we probably should have. 'We asked for the bill and we wished to leave. There was a problem with the card machine. 'I thought they grossly over-reacted by calling security who were hovering in the background. 'The bar staff were quite inconsiderate given we had been guests at the hotel. 'I did use bad language outside which I apologise for. 'We were treated extremely badly given we had just gone there for a few drinks, which had been very enjoyable up until that point. 'I absolutely did not punch Mr Draey, I never have been in a fight in my life, I have never punched anyone - that is not who I am. 'I use words and the words I used that night were regrettable.' Jonathan Swain, prosecuting, had earlier said: 'Mr Reynolds was very drunk and as a result, he was asked to leave by management. 'He was escorted from the premises by Mr Draey. While outside, there was an unprovoked assault by Mr Reynolds. 'He . punched Mr Draey in the face. There was no threat of violence by either . individual and as a result, a struggle ensued. He was held by two door . staff until the police arrived. City of London Magistrates Court heard his credit card was declined on December 18th due to a malfunction on the machine . 'In essence the question is whether that violence was justified and the Crown says it was not.' Reynolds . was taken to the pavement outside the hotel when the victim, who had . his hands behind his back, started talking to him. Giving evidence, Mr Draey told the court his injury was so severe that he had a 'black eye at Christmas'. He added: 'I was called to the bar and found two gentlemen who were unable to pay for their drinks. 'I tried to communicate with them, but he [Reynolds] was not responding. When he did it was gibberish. 'We didn't want them in the bar because they were too drunk and had been abusive. 'When outside, I thought they were going to push some plant pots over as they were going towards them. 'I . was a couple of feet away and Reynolds kept coming back and forth . calling the doormen names and calling me a c*** - all kinds of swear . words. 'I work at a five star hotel, I don't really respond to that kind of abuse. 'I was completely passive and no threat to him whatsoever. He kept telling me I was going to regret it, calling me a c***. My hands were behind my back and then he hit me. 'It . was a punch, he punched me in the face in my nose with a closed fist. It was hard enough to break my nose - I got several fractures. Reynolds, 31, punched Arza Daery (pictured) after he was kicked out of the Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge following a three hour drinking session . 'As soon as he punched me me and my colleague grabbed him, I got blood all over him. 'I was on top of him and asked him 'would you like me to hit you?' He said yes, but I didn't hit him. 'I had to spend Christmas with a black eye, it got a lot worse. For months after when I blew my nose, blood was coming out.' Reynolds' card was eventually accepted for the £500 bill, but he was so drunk that Mr Draey did not even think he was English. The court heard how an inebriated Reynolds spat abuse at the bouncers and bizarrely claimed he was related to the Royal family. Cleuber Martins, the second bouncer, said: 'The defendant was talking in French. 'He . was shouting some bad swear words, calling everyone a c***, claiming to . be related to the Royal family, saying we were all going to lose our . jobs. 'He kept saying ""you deserve it, you're all c***s, I'm related to the Queen"".' The investment analyst stared straight ahead as the verdict was read out. Magistrate chair Mena Rego said: 'We have heard a great deal of alcohol was consumed by you a d your friends and this undoubtedly would have had a bearing on your account and behaviour. 'We gave greater weight to the account of the bouncers. 'You were taken to the ground by Mr Martins and restrained by Mr Draey who was on top of you. 'He suffered a punch on the nose caused by an unprovoked attack.' Reynolds, of Highbury, north London, is due to be sentenced on October 4th.","David Reynolds, 31, punched Arza Daery at Berkeley Hotel, Knightsbridge .

Ed Miliband was accused of ‘economic vandalism’ yesterday after his shock proposal to fix energy prices wiped almost £2billion from the value of Britain’s two largest power firms. The Labour leader faced a storm of criticism at his ‘insane’ plan to enforce price controls if he enters Downing Street. A defiant Mr Miliband said it was possible that a government he led would also seek to control other markets, fuelling speculation that Labour might step in to regulate water, rail and petrol. Scroll down for video . Fight: Ed Miliband has face a storm of criticism for his plan to plan to freeze energy bills for 20 months . On ice: Labour has produced models of an energy bill in a block of ice to show how the party would freeze prices for two years . In a brutal backlash against his announcement, energy investors warned the 1970s-style policies would lead to economic shutdown. Shares in British Gas owner Centrica and SSE – the only two ‘big six’ power giants on the London Stock Exchange – plunged by 5 per cent, wiping £1.9billion from their combined value. More than 200 pensions and investment funds holding the life savings of millions of people across the UK are exposed to Centrica’s share price. And the giant company warned ‘it would not be economically viable to continue’ supplying energy in Britain if prices were capped while costs were rising. Lord Mandelson, a former Business Secretary under Labour, last night criticised Mr Miliband’s demand for a resetting of the energy market. He said: ‘I believe that perceptions of Labour policy are in danger of being taken backwards. 'At the Business Department I tried to move on from the conventional choice in industrial policy between state control and laissez faire.' Critics said Mr Miliband had the chance to change the industry when he was Energy Secretary before the last election, but chose not to. Backlash: Energy investors warned the 1970s-style policies would lead to economic shutdown . Challenge: In an open letter to the ¿big six¿ energy companies, Mr Miliband said that the public had lost faith in them . Official figures show that the largest rise in energy prices since 1997 was during the years when Mr Miliband had the job. A senior regulatory source said: ‘Miliband was presented with a plan in 2010, which aimed to secure the supply of affordable energy to British households – but he sat on it and did nothing.’ Centrica’s largest shareholder, Neil Woodford from Invesco, who controls the savings and pension investments of millions, fiercely attacked the Labour leader. He said: ‘This policy is economic vandalism at a time when this country needs all the help it can get. It is insane. If Centrica and SSE cannot make any money supplying electricity to the retail market then they won’t supply it. The lights will go off, the economy will shut down.’ One former Labour government minister warned Mr Miliband’s ‘socialist’ policies would push unemployment beyond three million. Digby Jones, who served as trade minister under Gordon Brown, said: ‘The sheer damage it will do to the economy does not bear thinking about. They are talking that this will be the end of the energy market – it’s far more dangerous. 'This is sheer, unbridled socialism. He is going to hijack the organs of management.’ The crossbench peer, a former head of business group the CBI, added: ‘I go around the world, banging the drum for Britain, trying to get companies to invest in Britain. Yesterday just made that a little more difficult. He is going to sacrifice Britain’s prosperity on the altar of social tribalism.’ Mr Miliband dismissed the idea that his party conference speech on Tuesday marked a shift to the Left, and rejected his ‘Red Ed’ nickname. ‘I’m One Nation Ed,’ he said. ‘I think what people are interested in is not labels, people are interested in how somebody’s going to tackle the problems in their life.’ Polls suggest that Mr Miliband’s confrontation with the energy firms could prove popular. A recent YouGov poll found that 38 per cent of Britons trusted energy companies less than the year before, and 76 per cent wanted government to do more to reduce energy prices. In an open letter to the ‘big six’ energy companies, Mr Miliband said that the public had lost faith in them: ‘There is a crisis of confidence. We face a stark choice. We can work together on the basis of this price freeze to make the market work in the future. 'Or you can reinforce in the public mind that you are part of the problem not the solution.’ Mr Miliband conceded it was possible firms might try to increase bills just before the proposed price freeze kicked in, but warned them that would be against the law. Energy analyst Peter Atherton from Liberum Capital told the Daily Mail: ‘This is a clarion call to disinvest from the UK energy sector. It’s a screaming headline that people should rush to pull their money out of Britain. ‘That’s why, in the 25 years since privatisation, no-one has gone near energy price controls.’ The move is also likely to breach EU rules and could be slapped down as illegal, he claimed. Tony Cocker, the chief executive of E.on, wrote to Mr Miliband to say ‘at a stroke’ bills could be greatly reduced by funding green levies through general taxation rather than loading them on to households. The value of Centrica, owner of British Gas, and Scottish and Southern Energy fell by a combined £2billion in London trading . Ed Miliband’s attempt to fix energy prices has already had a devastating impact on the shares of Britain’s power giants. The value of Centrica, owner of British Gas, and Scottish and Southern Energy fell by a combined £2billion in London trading. This was no knee-jerk reaction. City analysts and investors believe that Mr Miliband has made a major blunder that could potentially damage energy investment between now and 2017 – the point at which his price freeze would be lifted. Here are my predictions for what could be the fall-out from his declaration. Markets require certainty of pricing to invest. As a result, major shareholders will not fund new energy projects if they do not believe that their spending will be profitable. City analysts and investors believe that Mr Miliband has made a major blunder that could potentially damage energy investment between now and 2017 . The UK faces a one-in-four chance of power cuts this winter, according to confidential calculations by the energy regulator Ofgem. Mr Miliband’s price freeze would make it  more likely that such outages would occur, as long-awaited investment in new storage facilities, particularly for gas, would be delayed. Centrica and SSE, the only UK-owned power companies, have the largest number of mothballed gas-production facilities. With no guarantees that economic energy prices can be delivered, those plants are unlikely to be brought back into production as the Government had hoped. The Government and EDF – the state-owned French company – are currently in intense negotiations over a guaranteed price for future nuclear energy output. The talks have reached a stalemate, as the Treasury has been reluctant to accept EDF’s demand for  £98 per kilowatt hour. Mr  Miliband’s intervention could make the negotiation of a future price even more difficult. Some believe it may cause EDF to pull back from one of the biggest investments ever planned for the UK. The prospects of greater competition in the energy supply market will be crushed.  A number of new, smaller  competitors have recently entered the market, seeking  to undercut the bigger operators. There will be no prospect of that if prices are controlled by a new Labour government. The immediate impact of Mr Miliband’s speech will be felt by every person in the country with a pension fund invested in the UK’s power firms.  Profits and dividends would have to be cut to deal with his proposed price controls; this would be particularly painful for the three million private investors in Centrica, who bought shares following the Tell Sid campaign in 1986. A price freeze would also destroy faith in private-sector investment in our utility companies. It could have a disastrous effect on the upcoming share offering of the Royal Mail, if investors believe that an incoming Labour government would seek to impose new price controls on the postal service as well. Ed Miliband may have declared war on energy price rises, but he was the minister who brought in crippling green taxes which greatly inflated fuel and power bills for every household. Mr Miliband was Labour’s Energy Secretary between 2008 and 2010 when household energy bills rose at more than double the pace than they have done under the Coalition. Mr Miliband pushed through the Climate Change Act in 2008, committing the UK to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. He committed Britain to building thousands of wind farms and other costly green measures as he warned ‘there is no low-cost energy future’. To pay for them, green ‘stealth taxes’ were added to household bills. Green levies now account for £110 or 11 per cent of the average £1,000 household energy bill. By 2020, the figure will rise to an average of £280. Yesterday energy firms said a more ‘honest’ approach would be for the Government to pay for green measures out of general taxation. Alistair Phillips-Davies, boss of Scottish and Southern Energy, said: ‘If Labour removed these stealth taxes from bills and paid for them through taxation, not only would it reduce bills, it would have the progressive effect of shifting the burden of paying from those who can’t afford to pay to those who can.’ Gas bills jumped nearly 28 per cent in 2008 and 2009, while the price of electricity rose more than 14 per cent. The Office for National Statistics figures show gas bills rose about 13 per cent and electricity bills by just over 6 per cent in 2011 and 2012 – the first full two years of the current government.","Shares in British Gas owner Centrica and SSE plunged by five per cent .

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 18:31 EST, 25 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:03 EST, 26 September 2013 . More than half of women in Britain are still working when they reach the age of 60, new figures have revealed. According to official statistics, the number of women forced to carry on working into their sixties has risen sharply over the past decade. In 1993 only 35.1 per cent of women had a job when they reached the age of 60, but just twenty years later this has jumped to 51.5 per cent. The figures, from the Office for . National Statistics, highlight the crippling impact of the rising . pension age on a generation of women who are having to wait longer than . ever before they can retire. Women . used to be able to get their state pension from the age of 60. At the . moment they can claim the money at the age of 61 and nine months. However this is set to rise to 65 in 2018, 66 in 2020 and 67 by 2028. With no state pension to replace their income, many simply have ‘no choice’ but to keep on working, experts claim. They . said the problem has been exacerbated by rock-bottom savings rates and . poor company pensions as well as the additional burden of grown-up . offspring who can struggle to get by without financial support. While some women are keen to work, enjoying the social interaction and the intellectual stimulation as well as the money, experts insisted yesterday that many would choose to retire if they felt that was a viable option. Neil Duncan-Jordan, from the National Pensioners Convention, said: ‘Of course there will be individuals who have exciting, interesting jobs which they feel able to keep on doing for years and years. Outrage: George Osborne caused fury at a conference earlier this year after celebrating the enormous savings he had made from the Pensions Bill . ‘But for the vast majority of women, they have no choice but to keep working because their pensions are so poor and the Government is increasing the state pension age. Women have been treated extremely badly.’ The ONS figures show sharp increases among employment rates for all women in their sixties. For 61-year-old women, the percentage working has jumped from 28 per cent to 43 per cent since 1993, with similar increases among older women. Under Labour’s old timetable the state pension age was due to increase to 67 between 2034 and 2036. But the Coalition has moved this to between 2026 and 2028 – a hugely lucrative decision. This measure alone will save the country ‘approximately £71billion,’ according to official estimates in the Pensions Bill. At a conference in London earlier this year, George Osborne triggered fury after celebrating the ‘absolutely enormous savings’ from the controversial policy. He said: ‘The savings dwarf almost everything else you do. They are absolutely enormous savings.’ The Chancellor added: ‘I found it actually one of the less controversial things we have done, and yet it probably has saved more money than anything else we have done.’ Caroline Abrahams, from Age UK, said: ‘People are living longer and generally in better health, so many are likely to want and be able to carry on working. ‘However rock-bottom annuity rates combined with low interest rates on savings mean that others have no choice but to carry on working because they cannot afford to retire.’ While the number of workers in Britain has reached a record high of nearly 30million, it is largely pensioners who are fuelling the boom. Since 2008, the number of people between the age of 16 and 64 has jumped by 673,000, but those who actually have a job fell by 76,000. Meanwhile the number of people aged 65 and over who are working has rocketed over the last five years. Between April and June 2008, 695,000 so-called ‘grey workers’ had a job. Today there are more than one million workers in this age group. This is partly down to the Government’s decision to scrap the default retirement age, which has meant bosses can no longer kick out a worker simply because they have reached the age of 65. As a result, more and more people are deciding to work into their late sixties and seventies – with many saying they simply cannot afford to retire due to a lack of money. Pensions minister Steve Webb said: ‘We took action so older people were no longer discriminated against by abolishing the default retirement age. There are now more older women in work, despite difficult economic conditions.’ Men are squeezed out by rise of the working mum . Jill Kirby, author of The Price of Parenthood said the pressure on working mothers is increasing . The percentage of British men who work has collapsed over the last 40 years, while the number of working women has rocketed, the Office for National Statistics revealed yesterday. The figures highlight an extraordinary social change which has been fuelled by the ballooning number of working mothers. While the majority used to stay at home with their children, many now choose to work – or are forced to for financial reasons. In 1971, 92 per cent of men between the age of 16 and 64 had a job. Today just 76 per cent of men in this age group are working. But the percentage of women in work has jumped from 53 to 67 per cent over the last 42 years. In fact nearly three-quarters of mothers who are married or living with a partner have a job, compared to only two-thirds in 1996 – a sign of rapid social change, according to the ONS. At present, there are 15.3million working men and 13.5million working women, but experts predict the number of working women will overtake working men within 15 years. Family expert Jill Kirby, author of The Price of Parenthood, said: ‘The pressure continues to increase for mothers to work. Yet we know from studies and surveys that mothers would like to have more time for their families.’ Lynne Burnham, from campaign group Mothers at Home Matter, said: ‘For mothers to be at home, to forego the second income, is a choice fewer families can afford to make. It is coming to be seen as the privilege of a rich elite.’","The figures, from the Office for .

A gang that deliberately crashed a 12 tonne bus with 26 passengers on board as part of a huge 'crash-for-cash' scam, has been described as a 'a professionally-planned, highly-organised group' by police. Four people were found guilty at Sheffield Crown Court today of playing a part in a fraud conspiracy worth almost £500,000. Seven other people had already pleaded guilty. The damage on the bus that was deliberately crashed with 26 passengers on board as part of a huge scam . The gang that arranged for the crash to happen has been described as a 'a professionally-planned, highly-organised group' by police . South Yorkshire Police said inquiries began after an apparently routine, minor collision involving a bus and a Vauxhall Zafira in the Burngreave area of Sheffield, on June 17, 2011. The bus driver, Adam Herbert, was in on the plot. The force said investigations into claims following the bus crash led to a wider inquiry into the activities of a Sheffield-based accident claims company called City Claims 4 U, run by defendants Mohammed Omar Gulzar and Shoaib Nawaz. A spokesman said they went on to identify suspects involved in 10 incidents in Halifax, Sheffield and Rotherham. Shoaib Nawaz (left) and Mohammed Omar Gulzar (right) ran accident claims company City Claims 4 U . Bus driver Adam Herbert was in on the plot . He said a series of warrants were executed at a number of addresses linked to City Claims 4 U after officers received information that it had been submitting fraudulent claims to insurance companies. These claims were boosted by false claims for the hiring out of replacement vehicles provided by CCC Hire 4 U - another company owned by Gulzar. Today, four people were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud insurance companies between January 1 and July 31, 2011. They were Gulzar, 31, of Sheffield; Nawaz, 25, of Sheffield; Sami Ahmed Selam, 37, of Flint, and Javed Khan, 46, of Birmingham. Those who pleaded guilty are: Herbert, 25, of Sheffield; Saeeda Ali Bi, 39, of Sheffield; Safaida Bi, 30, of Bradford; Mohammed Abbas Jaffar, 25, of Coventry; Saif Allah Kara Glenn, 25, of Coventry; Osman Bakri, 25, of Sheffield, and Dusan Pacan, 27, of Sheffield. Dc Mark Wootton, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a professionally-planned, highly-organised group of individuals who set out to defraud a number of insurance companies by making deliberate false claims and pocketing the money for themselves. 'The fraud involved false claims for personal injury, vehicle damage, over-inflated recovery and storage costs, together with extortionate and false claims for hire vehicles from CCC Hire 4 U, a company owned and run by Mohammed Omar Gulzar.' South Yorkshire Police's Economic Crime Unit manager, Graham Wragg said: 'The police have a duty to protect life and, while some of the accidents were totally fictitious, others involved members of the public and placed them in danger. Sami Ahmed Selam (left) and Javed Khan (right) were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud insurance companies . Osman Bakri pleaded guilty . 'After their convictions today, the police will use the Proceeds of Crime Act to recover, as far as possible, any benefit these fraudsters had from their criminal activity.' Officers said they worked closely with the Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB), a London-based industry organisation, and FirstGroup to identify and gather evidence. IFB director Ben Fletcher said they are currently investigating more than 90 criminal gangs involved in 'crash-for-cash' fraud. He said: 'Scams like this expose the shocking lengths fraudsters go to make money through what they wrongly assume is a victimless crime. '""Crash-for-cash"" costs the insurance . industry £392 million per year, but it's honest policyholders who . ultimately have their pockets picked by the fraudsters. 'But beyond the financial impact, this is a dangerous crime. Stage managing crashes is reckless. 'No-one can control that series of events . and fraudsters are gambling with the lives of innocent people when they . try to do so - particularly when a 12-tonne bus is involved.' Saeeda Ali Bi (left) and Dusan Pacan (right) were part of a gang that deliberately crashed a 12 tonne bus . Dave Alexander, regional managing director for First UK Bus in the North Region, said: 'Our passengers and their safety and security is our highest priority. Although the collision in question was a minor bump, the consequences could have been much worse. 'To have potentially put people's lives at risk, by staging a collision was dangerous, callous and quite unbelievable. 'I can assure our customers that we will continue to relentlessly pursue any instances of fraud on our buses, because ultimately it's the honest, fare paying customer who is the real victim when unscrupulous people try and cheat the system.' Those convicted will be sentenced at a date to be fixed.","Crash-for-cash gang described as 'highly-organised' by police .

Unions today demanded a Labour government seize control of Royal Mail and the railways. In a further sign of the party lurching to the left, the Labour conference voted to demand the renationalisation of train firms and postal deliveries. Ed Miliband moved quickly to try to reject the idea, claiming there was not the money available for a future government to buy back privatised services. Labour members and unions demanded Labour promise to renationalise the Royal Mail and the railways . The Labour leader yesterday delivered what was widely seen as one of the most left-wing speeches by a party chief for decades. He vowed to use state controls to block energy bill rises, seize land which developers refuse to build on and drive up wages in some sectors. Today delegates backed motions calling for Labour to renationaliste the railways and reverse the coalition's plans to sell-off the Royal Mail. Tosh McDonald, vice president of the train drivers' union Aslef, said it was ‘a nonsense’ that most of the railways remain in private ownership, claiming that higher fares should not subsidise investment in the network. In a speech to the Labour Party conference in Brighton, Mr McDonald said East Coast Mainline, which is publicly owned, made £800 million for the Treasury, while only 1.3 per cent of its income came from the taxpayer. Labour leader Ed Miliband has faced claims he wants to return Britain to 1970s-style state control . By comparison, he said, the Virgin-run West Coast Mainline took 13 per cent of its income from the Government. In an emergency motion put to the conference, which was seconded by Aslef and tabled by railway workers' union the TSSA, delegates were asked to support the renationalising of the railways. The motion stated: ‘Conference calls on a future Labour government to run our railways in the interest of passengers by retaining and extending this successful model of public ownership to each franchise as it expires and by integrating track and train operations.’ Mick Carney, president of the TSSA, said the model of privatisation had failed and urged Mr Miliband to be as tough with rail firms as he has promised to be with energy companies by ordering a two-year freeze in bills. He said: ‘Privatisation has failed. It has failed with the energy companies, where year on year prices rocket, so it is no surprise to see them bleating on after Ed's announcement yesterday. ‘It has failed in the water industry, where before this year we had seven of the wettest summers on record and yet as soon as the sun comes out they are screaming for hosepipe bans because the huge profits they have made have lined the pockets of shareholders and not fixed pipes. ‘It has failed the NHS and, unless we fight, it will fail the Royal Mail. The list goes on and it has failed our railways.’ Meanwhile the Communication Workers' Union (CWU) led the calls to keep the Royal Mail in public hands. Katy Clark, Labour MP for North Ayrshire and Arran, defied Mr Miliband to offer her support to the campaign after claiming it would be a ‘disaster’ for postal services should privatisation go-ahead. But the Labour leadership moved to rebuff the calls. A senior party source said: ‘Renationalisation is not out policy. Conference is entitled to its view. We are going to do the right thing. We are not going to spend money we do not have.’","Party conference in Brighton votes for renationalisation of services .

Ed Miliband's attempt to distance himself from controversial spin doctor Damian McBride ran into serious trouble last night. The Labour leader insists he asked Gordon Brown to sack Mr McBride because of his ‘reprehensible’ briefings against colleagues. But Mr McBride says he and Mr Miliband worked together for eight years and enjoyed ‘four years of real friendship’. Friends?: Ed Miliband, left, shared 'four years of real friendship' with the spin doctor he blasted as 'reprehensible', according to an extract of Damian McBride's memoirs, Power Trip . In the latest extracts from his explosive memoir, serialised in the Daily Mail, he claims Mr Miliband – far from being concerned about smears against other politicians – only complained when he felt the spin doctor had undermined him by revealing his part in Gordon Brown’s botched decision not to call an election in 2007. ‘Ed didn’t particularly care whether I was guilty or not; I was just a convenient person to blame,’ he said. Revelations: Spin doctor Damian McBride walking with Gordon Brown during his premiership . Distance: Ed Miliband tried to distance himself from the controversy on The Andrew Marr Show yesterday . Douglas Alexander has been implicated in the leak of a hugely damaging account of how Gordon Brown was once snubbed five times by Barack Obama. A source close to the shadow foreign secretary is said to have told the Press about Mr Brown’s disastrous New York trip in 2009, when he was only able to snatch a chat with the President in a UN kitchen. Allegations about the source of the leak are made in the explosive memoirs of Damian McBride. Yesterday, Mr Alexander said at a party conference meeting he had ‘paid a price’ for opposing Mr McBride’s ‘destructive’ style of politics and had wanted him sacked. But Mr McBride replied on Twitter: ‘When Douglas poses as the voice of probity and unity, I draw the line.’ Why? Because that created the impression he'd been wronged by someone close to Gordon and Ed Balls. That, in turn, allowed him to get some distance from the sinking ship in Number Ten, plus some victim status with Labour MPs.' Mr McBride’s sensational book lifts the lid on years of amoral feuding, plotting and character assassination at the heart of Labour and has overshadowed the start of its annual conference. Other key revelations in the latest extracts include: . Mr McBride’s book Power Trip, to be published this week, has revealed how the former spin doctor has confessed to discrediting Mr Brown’s enemies and rivals by tipping off the media about drug use, spousal abuse, alcoholism and extra-marital affairs. It has proved acutely embarrassing for Mr Miliband and Mr Balls, since they were at the heart of what has been branded a ‘malign and awful’ political operation run by Mr Brown. On BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday, Mr Miliband was asked whether he could ‘look into your heart during that period and say to yourself that you were completely clean’. The Labour leader insisted he had not been part of the brutal culture of spin and smear, adding: ‘I was concerned about the activities of Damian McBride and indeed I complained to Gordon Brown. ‘I was worried that there were indications that he was briefing against colleagues and I didn’t think that was the way politics should be practised.’ But in today’s book extracts, Mr McBride says Mr Miliband dumped him solely to further his own political career. Mr McBride recalls Mr Miliband calling him and declaring ‘we are finished’ in a voice like a computer’s. Ed Miliband: ‘I was concerned about the activities of Damian McBride and indeed I complained to Gordon Brown. I was worried he was briefing against colleagues and I didn’t think that was the way politics should be practised.’ Former Cabinet Minister Dame Tessa Jowell: ‘Gordon [Brown] is not an innocent, it is inconceivable he did not know what Damian was doing. Damian clearly felt it was implicitly sanctioned. In the absence of a very clear statement by Gordon that he didn’t know about it, it damages his reputation.’ Former Spin doctor Alastair Campbell: ‘He [Gordon Brown] had a real flaw for this need for truly horrible people to be around him, doing truly horrible things and giving him, the Labour Party, and politics, a bad name. I am still angry about Damian McBride.’ Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna: ‘If any good comes from Damian McBride’s indulgence, it’s to remind people that that’s not the way we do things. Everybody who was around then, and is still around, knows how damaging that was. Think how much more we could have achieved  if so much energy had not been expended on this nonsense.’ Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper: ‘It happened some years ago, but I think it’s a sign of how much the Labour Party has changed. The very different climate, the very different way in which Ed Miliband is managing things and operating things now, that’s a good thing. We don’t want to go back to the navel-gazing of the past.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls:  ‘He was a law unto himself, it now seems.’","Damian McBride says they were friends when working together for 8 years .

Scroll down for video . Presented with a box full of nuts, this baby red squirrel couldn't resist diving in... head first . With only a short break for a quick scratch, the lucky chap went straight back to feeding when also offered a handful of nuts . And the RSNE’s efforts are paying off – the red squirrel population is growing for the first time in 140 years. The conservationists estimate reds now total 10,000-15,000, still dwarfed by the 2-4million greys. Mr Gallagher, 38, built a squirrel box at his home in Choppington, Northumberland, after noticing reds hopping in from a nearby wood, and now he gets up to six visitors a day. ‘It’s very important people know about the risk of losing the red squirrel,’ he said. ‘They are such cute, funny little creatures. I would encourage everyone to report any sightings of reds and help keep them safe.’ Aside from being bullied out of food, the reds are also being killed off by squirrel pox, which greys carry but are immune to. The RSNE protects and feeds the red and culls the grey – which is officially classed as vermin – and a new survey of theirs shows a 7 per cent rise in reds and 18 per cent fall in greys. This small garden in Northumberland has become a haven for the illusive Red Squirrel - just like this inquisitive little fellow . Since moving into the terrace house in Choppington over a year ago Gary Gallagher has seen his garden over run with the UK native red species - who cant get enough of the food he leaves them . The creatures have become so accustomed to him, they can be photographed extremely close . RSNE project manager Nick Mason said: ‘Greys and reds can’t live together, the reds will always lose. We have to trap the greys and shoot them, sadly there is no other way if we are to ensure the reds don’t become extinct in England. 'The figures for the last year show a hopeful picture for the reds.’ Mr Gallagher, 38, became involved in the project after discovering red squirrels running into his back garden at Choppington, Northumberland, from a nearby wood. It is the first time in 140 years the red squirrel is celebrating a resurgence, according to wildlife group Red Squirrel Northern England . Mr Gallagher, 38, became involved in the project after discovering red squirrels running into his back garden from a nearby wood . The inquisitive creatures, personified by Squirrel Nutkin in the Beatrix Potter books are tame enough to feed from his hand when topping up his garden feeding boxes .

'I put some nuts and seeds out and the next day there were five in the garden. I became interested in them, discovered they were at risk of dying out and decided to do all I could - little as it is - to protect them.

The family moved there about six or . seven years ago, after Mr Wallwork divorced his first wife Donna . Farrimond, the children’s mother, who is disabled and lives in Wigan. Chief Fire Officer for Sligo Paul . Coyle said an investigation of the property discovered a blockage close . to the top of the chimney. He told the court through a statement . that he concluded a ‘coincidental and incredible’ set of circumstances . were responsible for the deaths. The amount of carbon monoxide in the . room would have risen quickly to ‘very dangerous’ levels as the family . sat there unaware. The bodies of Mr Wallwork and his . children were found the next day when his step-daughter, Vicky, arrived . after failing to get any response by phone. After repeatedly banging on doors and . windows of the bungalow in Gurteen, she saw Mr Wallwork unresponsive in . an armchair with the children on the floor and the television and . Christmas lights still on. Mrs Wallwork, who was in hospital being . treated for cancer at the time, died about six months later. Pathologist . Dr Michael Curtis said the cause of all three deaths was carbon . monoxide poisoning with high levels detected in the blood. Coroner Alan Walsh recorded verdicts . of accidental death and added: ‘I have found it to be one of the most . tragic cases I have heard in the court after sitting here for 12 years.’ After the hearing, Mr Wallwork’s brother-in-law Arthur Flather said: . ‘Trevor was a devoted dad, brother, son and uncle. ‘He was much-loved and the children . were gorgeous and their teachers both in Ireland and England said how . well-behaved they were. As a family we want to encourage people to fit . carbon monoxide poisoning detectors.’ Hearing: Donna Farrimond, ex-wife of Trevor Wallwork, and mother of their children Kimberley and Harry Wallwork, outside Bolton Coroner's Court . Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless, poisonous gas produced by incomplete burning of carbon-based fuels, including gas, oil, wood and coal. When CO enters the body, it prevents the blood from bringing oxygen to cells, tissues, and organs. Around 11 people die from CO poisoning each year in the UK - according to the Heath Safety Executive. Symptoms include headaches or dizziness, breathlessness, nausea, loss of consciousness and tiredness. Carbon Monoxide can be produced by any combustion appliance, including those that burn fossil fuels such as oil, wood and coal. If you have one of these appliances you should make sure that it is serviced and maintained by a competent person and the chimney is regularly swept.","Trevor Wallwork and his two children died while watching TV in their home .

Tribunal: Fire station commander Warren Simpson, 48, is suing his bosses for alleged race discrimination . A black fire station commander is suing bosses for race discrimination, claiming colleagues nicknamed him ‘Frank’ after the boxer Frank Bruno. Warren Simpson says he suffered victimisation, harassment and bullying and was passed over for promotion for seven years. The Birmingham-based commander, 48, alleges his career was not  supported in the same way as white colleagues, leaving him ‘demeaned, subjugated and belittled’. The commander, believed to be the highest-ranked black officer in the West Midlands Fire Service, is taking his brigade to an employment tribunal after claiming he was victim of race discrimination, including victimisation, harassment and bullying. Mr Simpson joined the brigade in 1985 . and worked at various stations before becoming a station commander at . fire service headquarters in Birmingham. His wife Cordell Simpson represented him at the city tribunal. She claimed he had been referred to as ‘Frank’ after the ex-world champion Bruno. Mrs . Simpson added: 'Mr Simpson believes his development has not been . supported in a comparable way of that of his white colleagues.' The . discrimination accusation was denied by David Maxwell, representing . West Midlands Fire Service, who labelled harassment and bullying claims . as 'absolutely preposterous'. He . suggested Mr Simpson had his 'ups and downs' with a boss but that they . were good friends. He also accused the commander of ‘over-reacting’. The . hearing was also told that the fire station commander had been on sick . leave at one stage and that an occupational health report had been . prepared. Mr Simpson . had previously told the tribunal he wanted a face-to-face meeting with . one of his bosses to discuss the way he was being treated. 'Discrimination': Warren Simpson claims that bosses at West Midlands Fire Service blocked him from rising above the rank of station commander . The father-of-three said he also requested a transfer to another fire station, but the service said there had been only four vacancies available at the time at other stations. Mrs Simpson added: 'In conclusion, it is submitted that Mr Simpson has experienced racial discrimination, victimisation and harassment in the form of a constant shifting of the goalposts by the respondents. 'They have sought to block his progression beyond that of station commander, demean, subjugate and belittle him, ignoring him when he raises serious concerns and then adding insult to injury by claiming it is all in his head and sending him for a mental health assessment.' The hearing ended on Friday and a judgement is expected in mid-November. Mr Simpson, from Corby in Northamptonshire, is being represented by the group Race 4 Justice, which said that he was the highest-ranked black fire service officer in the West Midlands. Waiting game: Mr Simpson, who is said to be the highest-ranked black officer in he West Midlands Fire Service, will find out the results of his employment tribunal in November .","Warren Simpson is the highest-ranked black fire officer in the West Midlands .

A thief who took part in a raid on a petrol station which caused £165,000 of damage after a cash machine was blown up has been jailed. Damien Limb, 27, was the driver during the heist on the Texaco garage, where a masked gang pumped oxygen and propane gas into the cash point to blow it open. The explosion catapulted the machine's heavy door 25 metres, leaving £20,000 in bank notes strewn across the ground at the garage in Weyhill, Hampshire. Caught: Damien Limb was jailed for three and a half years for his part in the raid on the petrol station, where a gang blew up a cash machine, scattering £20,000 across the forecourt and causing £165,000 of damage . However, the thieves only managed to scoop up just £3,400 before making their getaway. At Winchester Crown Court, Limb was jailed for three years and six months for conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to cause criminal damage with unknown persons. The court heard how in March the gang prized open the cash machine using a crowbar, before pumping the dangerous mix in through hoses and sealing the hole with paper. Seconds later the mixture ignited, causing a huge blast, which hurled debris up to 34 metres away. The mangled cash machine door sliced through a thick stanchion 'like a knife through butter'. The heist was captured on CCTV, which showed three men clad in black scrambling around in a desperate bid to grab the £20 notes littering the ground. Over £16,000 cash was recovered, but the damage the garage totalled £150,000, with another £15,000 for the cash machine. Limb is the only member of the gang arrested so far. The court heard how he had been connected to the raid after police followed a trail of cash and wheel tracks from the cylinders’ trolley from the scene, under a bridge where a receipt for water and a small amount of petrol from a garage in Bristol was found. The thieves used oxygen and propane gas to blow up the cash machine, causing £165,000 of damage to the garage's canopy and petrol pumps . Michael Warren, prosecuting, said: 'As a result of that explosion, police were called and were quickly on the scene and the equipment used to blow the ATM was found. 'Two canisters of oxygen and propane gas were around the corner and also against a wall was a five foot wrecking bar, a Volvic bottle with petrol in it and a wick and by that a bottle top that had the defendant’s DNA and a partial match for two other people. 'It is not a particularly well known method of attacking an ATM machine and it had devastating results.' Richard Onslow, defending, said Limb, who has a string of previous convictions for burglary and attacking cash machines, had fallen in with the wrong crowd but he was no mastermind. Mr Onslow said, 'He was asked to provide transport, which he did for this enterprise. The court heard how the door of the cash machine was blown 25 metres, and sliced through a thick stanchion 'like a knife through butter' 'Asked to carry three others and canisters of oxygen and propane to Weyhill which he did, told where to park and he remained in the van. 'He knew that some damage would be caused to the ATM but he did not expect what happened was going to happen. 'As he waited in the van he heard the explosion and the others returned. The defendant is not the leading light in this conspiracy but he accepts he was wrong by becoming involved in it.” Judge Jane Miller QC told Limb that the gang was lucky no one had been hurt in the blast. She said, 'Had anyone been passing at the time, clearly some injuries would have been caused.' Speaking after the case, detective constable Paul Harfield added: 'The gang is fortunate to be alive because they had no control over that explosion and they could hurt others.'","Damien Limb, 27, was driver for the gang who blew up ATM during raid .

Perched on railing with a can of lager in one hand and a cigarette in the other, this mother is hardly setting a shining example to children filing out of a nearby primary school. The unnamed woman must have found the stress of the 3pm school run too hard to take as she swigged from the can while waiting opposite a man with a pram for her own child to come out of the school gates. The feckless mother was photographed by a furious fellow parent, also waiting outside Macaulay Primary Academy, in Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire. Bad example: A woman was spotted drinking from a can of lager outside a primary school in Grimsby, north east Lincolnshire. She is thought to be a parent waiting to pick her child up . He said: 'Children being exposed to this kind of behaviour will start to believe it is acceptable if something isn't done to stop this in the future. 'Isn't it an offence to drink in public at this time?' The photograph also drew the condemnation of the school's headteacher Julie Saunders who said she has since spoken to the parents involved. She said: 'Clearly this is not the sort of thing we want to see outside the school; it is not a good example. It is the first time this has happened. I have spoken to the parents about it and have had a positive response. 'If there are any more reports like this, I shall be speaking to the PCSOs for the area.' Mrs Saunders highlighted the rules for parents dropping off and collecting children from the school, adding: 'I do not allow smoking on our site and I have a code of conduct for parents because they come into the school. 'There is a level of behaviour which is not accepted. We do not allow smoking and there is no shouting or swearing or physical abuse and parents are not allowed to come in under the influence of drink or drugs.' North East Lincolnshire Councillor Ian Lindley, said that the mother's behaviour sends out the wrong kind of message to children at the school. The feckless mother was photographed by a furious fellow parent, also waiting outside Macaulay Primary Academy, in Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire . He said: 'We don’t like to dictate to parents about smoking and drinking, but they have to be reasonable where they do it. 'We are always trying to promote healthy lifestyles, particularly with children. 'Drinking in public, which we see a lot of on the West Marsh, is a difficult issue. 'All we can do is try to discourage people because it sends out the wrong message to young people that it is somehow socially acceptable.' The woman was pictured as the Association of Police Chiefs launched a campaign against drinking in public and related antisocial behaviour. The organisation says that 50 per cent of all violent crime is alcohol related, with half of domestic violence incidents and around a third of child abuse cases involving offenders who are under the influence of alcohol. As part of the nationwide campaign, Grimsby police officers will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the photo taken outside Macaulay Primary Academy and intend to name and shame those who drink irresponsibly in the town. Police and Crime Commissioner for Humberside, Matthew Grove, said: 'The clear message has to be that those who drink too much need to take responsibility for their own actions and this is something I will be working to address. 'In the cold light of day, many of the people I have seen behaving badly because of drink should feel embarrassed by their actions, and we must find ways to ensure the embarrassment lasts longer than the hangover.'","The unnamed woman was photographed at a school in Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire .

But it seems that one of the world's smallest primates, the cotton-top tamarin, has a lot to say behind the backs of zookeepers. Keepers at New York City's Central Park Zoo have recorded the chattering whispers of non-human primates for the first time ever. Scroll down for sound clip . Keepers at New York City's Central Park Zoo set out to record the primate's alarm calls when they were scared of people, but instead discovered the cotton-top tamarins (pictured) seemingly fell silent when a distrusted zoo worker entered their enclosure . They set out to record the primate's . alarm calls used when they are scared of people, but instead discovered the . monkeys seemingly fell silent when a distrusted zoo worker entered their . enclosure. However, when the keepers analysed their recordings - or audio spectrograms - at a later date, they were shocked to discover that the animals were communicating very quietly in whispers, io9 reported. Researchers Rachel Morrison and Diana Reiss who published their findings in the journal Zoo Biology, said the whispering could be evidence of convergent evolution in communication strategies used by social and cooperative species. The small cotton-top tamarins might whisper to each other in the tropical forests of northwestern Columbia in South America where they live. In another study, scientists suggest why apes do not have any musical talent, when humans, parrots, small birds, elephants and whales do. Matz Larsson, senior physician at the Lung Clinic at Örebro University Hospital, believes the ability to mimic and imitate things . like music and speech is the result of the fact that synchronised group . movement makes it possible to perceive sounds from the . surroundings better. A sound clip of the tamarin's whisper . When they analysed their recordings at a later date, they were shocked to discover that the cotton-top tamarins (pictured) were communicating very quietly in whispers. The researchers said the whispering could be evidence of convergent evolution in communication strategies used by social and cooperative species . The study asserts that the evolution of vocal learning, including musical traits, is influenced by the need of a species to deal with the disturbing sounds that are created in connection with locomotion. Dr Larsson said: 'When several people with . legs of roughly the same length move together, we tend to unconsciously . move in rhythm. When our footsteps occur simultaneously, a brief . interval of silence occurs. 'In . the middle of each stride we can hear our surroundings better. It . becomes easier to hear a pursuer, and perhaps easier to conduct a . conversation as well.' So it follows that apes in treetops and on the ground move unpredictably and irregularly and when humans made the transition to walking on two legs, the sounds of their . movements became significantly more predictable, making it possible for . them to listen to nature better and thereby increase their chances of . survival. In another study, scientists have found out why apes like the Orangutans pictured, do not have any musical talent, when humans, parrots, small birds, elephants and whales do . Dr Larsson explained that a behaviour that has survival value tends to produce dopamine, sometimes known as the 'reward molecule'. In dangerous terrain, this could result in the stimulation of rhythmic movements and enhanced listening to surrounding sounds in nature. If that kind of synchronised behaviour was rewarding in dangerous environments it may as well have been rewarding for the brain in relative safety, resulting in activities such as hand-clapping, foot-stamping and yelping around the campfire. From there it was just a short step to dance and rhythm and the hormone dopamine flows when we listen to music.","Zookeepers at New York City's Central Park Zoo have recorded the whispered communications of the cotton-top tamarin .

Assault: Litisha Henry (right), 23, was left with a swollen face, chipped teeth, clumps of her hair missing and cuts, bruises and scratches over her body after the attack by Franklin White (left), 44, in Rochester, Kent . The attack began at 2.20am on March 17 after the couple had argued following a night out together, before White launched a ferocious attack on his victim, punching her and dragging her by her hair. Miss Henry begged him to stop and witnesses who tried to intervene were threatened with violence. She said: 'I was on the floor - I begged him to stop and he just laughed. I was confused, I didn't really know what was going on. At one point I thought he was going to kill me because he wouldn't stop.'

Miss Henry added: 'When it happened I found out he'd done it to a few people before and obviously they'd never come forward to the police. 'So I'm just happy that he knows now that he can't get away with doing what he did, because no-one's ever come forward before.

Too close for comfort: Paul Goldstein is nearly bitten by the caiman as it bares its teeth after being pulled out of the pool at Pousada Araras Lodge in Pantanal, Brazil . The 10ft reptile had gotten stuck in the pool at Pousada Araras Lodge in Pantanal, where Mr Goldstein, from Wimbledon, was staying with a group he was guiding. Wimbledon-based Paul explains: ‘I was alerted by one of my tour clients after breakfast that an adult caiman was at the bottom of the pool. ’The creature had got himself stuck and local guide Juan and Ingrid Girahn from the lodge did their best to help free it from its chlorine-based incarceration. ’It proved very hard and also dangerous as a bite from this ten foot close relative of the crocodile would be more than a little graze.' Helping hands: The caiman was discovered in the lodge's pool and staff and guests immediately came to its aid . See you later alligator: After trying several different methods, the staff concluded that they needed to pull the caiman out of the pool by hand - tail first . Tail end: The 10ft reptile struggled as its rescuers began to pull it by its tail . ’This is a heavy animal so once I realised it was a struggle I got involved but it twisted out of our grasp. ’It was not until I saw the photos that I realised it was that close to biting me. ’Eventually . it was freed and skulked down to a nearby shrunken pool to go fishing, . it seemed the caiman was unimpressed by the whole ordeal.’ Caimans hail from the alligator family and closely resembles its cousins in appearance. The . caimans, native to Central and South America, are generally smaller . than alligators, and normally grow to be between four and six feet. Taking a risk: A helpful Mr Goldstein comes around to lend a hand to free the caiman, moving dangerously close to its front . Sharp edge: As he leans in, the caiman launches itself towards him with an open mouth, ready to take a chunk out of his leg .","Reptile nearly bites photographer in the leg during rescue mission .

Yvette Cooper sparked a  furious row over immigration last night after accusing the Tories of using the ‘language of the National Front’. The shadow home secretary used her speech to the Labour Party  conference to launch a ferocious attack on the Tories’ crackdown on illegal immigration. One Conservative MP last night described Miss Cooper’s intervention as ‘despicable’, and said it showed Labour was still not serious about tackling illegal immigrants. Controversy: The Home Office vans drove through six London boroughs as part of an initiative to reduce illegal immigration . Miss Cooper singled out a Home Office advertising campaign which warned those here illegally to ‘Go home or face arrest’. The ads, displayed on billboards carried by vans, were trialled in several London boroughs during the summer. Miss . Cooper also criticised immigration checks at Tube stations, which she . said were based on racial profiling. She said both measures were . ‘divisive gimmicks’ and ‘an utter disgrace’. She . added: ‘Unlike the Tories, we will not do checks at Tube stations . asking British people to prove their immigration status, targeted at . people for the colour of their skin. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the Labour conference the part had to talk about immigration . Labour today promised to make identity theft a specific criminal offence, in a bid to stem the tide of online crime. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the Labour Party conference that police are struggling to cope with net fraud. The British Retail Consortium estimates online crime in the retail sector alone costs £200million a year. Although fraudsters can be convicted of a series of crimes, a Labour source said the lack of an offence specifically relating to identity theft ‘leads to some confusion about how to arrest or charge people’. Miss Cooper said: 'We live our lives online now – but criminals know that too. It’s a big risk for business. And it’s a big cost for all of us. ‘When the credit card companies and banks write off fraud we all lose out from higher charges. The problem is escalating by the day. ‘The police can’t do this alone. They don’t stand a chance. We need changes in the law to make it easier to prosecute identity theft.’ Labour would also set up a new quango, Fraudwatch, to co-ordinate action against online criminals. ‘And . unlike the Tories, we won’t do ad vans sent to the highest black  and . ethnic British communities, borrowing the language of the 1970s National . Front. ‘Just consider . those ad vans were driving past the homes of families whose parents and . grandparents had to endure those same slogans scrawled high in graffiti . 40 years ago, whose children now run local businesses, work in hospitals . and schools, serve their country in our armed forces.’ Conservative . MP Nick de Bois fiercely rejected Miss Cooper’s claims and warned . Labour could not be trusted to deal with the legacy of illegal . immigration it had left behind. Mr . de Bois said: ‘I am very supportive of the ad vans – we want people who . are here illegally to go home and it is in their interests to offer . them the option of a voluntary return. ‘Yvette . Cooper’s comments are disgraceful and show just how out of touch Labour . is with public concerns about illegal immigration. They are nothing . more than an attempt to cover up Labour’s abject failure on the issue. It is despicable.’ Nick . Clegg has pledged to veto any repeat of the Home Office initiative. But . polls suggest the tough message is supported by the public. A . 20,000-strong survey by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft showed 79 . per cent of people backed the ‘Go home’ vans. Vans displaying billboards warning . overstaying migrants ‘Go home, or you'll be picked up and deported’ toured six London boroughs in July. The Liberal Democrats claim not to have been consulted about the vans, with Nick Clegg insisting he will veto plans to use them nationwide. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said they were ‘not the British way of doing things’. Miss Cooper added: ‘It really comes to something when even (UKIP leader) Nigel Farage says you have gone too far. ‘Those ad vans were not about illegal immigration and I say enough of the divisive gimmicks, they are an utter disgrace.’ Labour’s flagship immigration policy unravelled this week, after Ed Miliband vowed to force companies which bring skilled foreign workers into the UK to also hire a ‘local’ apprentice. But it emerged that the apprenticeships would have to be offered to anyone from within the EU. Ms Cooper rejected the idea that Labour could not debate immigration. She added: ‘Some people say Labour shouldn't talk about immigration. That it is pandering to prejudice or to the right. I disagree. ‘We don't have a mature and honest debate about immigration, we leave it to the divisive politics of the right. ‘That's why we have set out practical policies but I will not join an arms race of rhetoric on immigration. ‘And this party will never use immigration to play divide and rule.’ But Conservative Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: 'Conservatives have cut net immigration by a third since 2010 but shamefully Labour have opposed every single step we have taken to achieve that. Labour let the British people down badly when they were in office with uncontrolled immigration, net migration of more than 2.2 million and abuse of the visa system which was rife. ‘It is clear that the same old Labour Party have learned nothing from their past mistakes. They have no idea how to control immigration so that it works in our national interest. They have no credibility on this issue and the British people will never trust them on it again.’","Billboards caused a storm after touring six London boroughs .

The men who spent eight days clinging to the hull of a boat after being stranded at sea have spoken of their near-death experience and how they survived on seaweed and will. Anthony Douglas, 57, and Mike Russell, 58, from Freeport, Bahamas, set out on a fishing trip on September 7 on a 16-foot boat when a fierce storm caused it to capsize. They were eventually rescued on September 14 when a passing freighter spotted the men near Palm Beach County and a coast guard helicopter lifted them to safety. Speaking from his home in Abaco Island, Anthony Douglas described how the storm flooded their boat with water before a giant wave caused them to capsize. Miracle: Anthony Douglas and Mike Russell, pictured, were rescued by the US Coast Guard off the coast of Florida after spending eight days lost at sea . He told The Bahamas Tribune the boat ride was easy until 'out of nowhere bad weather appeared from all sides'. 'The weather came from all four parts of the sky. I could see Bimini from where we were, but I could not beat the weather. 'Water started coming into the boat . and then a wave came and threw us out. I had a searchlight in the pants . and it didn’t fall out so I grabbed and tried to look for Big Mike, . because we got thrown in two different directions. 'When I saw him, he was going under and so I swam to him, grabbed him and put him on top of the boat,' he said. The pair spent the next eight days . adrift, taking turns sleeping for a couple of minutes at a time, sucking . on seaweed to survive and praying someone would see them. 'We were having conversations with . people that were not there, pretending to eat food, we knew we didn’t . have, we were just losing it,' Anthony explained. 'It got so bad that around day six . Big Mike jumped in the water and said to me ""I’m holding you back, you . can survive without me"".' He jumped in behind him and told him: 'We are going to get out of here together,' before dragging him back on to the hull and tying their shirts together. 'Keep praying. Pray from your heart not from your belly,' he said. US Coast Guard officers had just finished a training mission, like the one seen in this file photo, before rescuing the two stranded men . 'The boat wasn’t balanced, we had to . stay straight or the boat would have turned over. We saw so many boats . pass us. 'I almost got run over from a tanker and nobody still saw us. The best day of our lives was when we saw that chopper.' The men's prayers were answered when a tow boat spotted them soon after, gave them water and contacted the U.S. Coast Guard. A helicopter whisked them to land where they were treated at Delray Beach Medical Center. According to the Sun Sentinel, they . were severely hydrated, the sun and salt water left their skin damaged . and their hands raw from gripping the fiberglass. Most people can only survive without water for three days. 'They were really exposed and really deteriorating quickly,' Coast Guard rescue swimmer Kyle Stallings said to The Sun Sentinel. Stallings . also said the victims were completely waterlogged when found. He said . their skin was deteriorating and their eyes were drooping. 'They were both in tears.

Over a hundred police officers were called to help move drills from a potential fracking site this afternoon - but only a few activists showed up to protest. Officers have been drafted in to assist energy company Cuadrilla remove their exploratory drilling equipment from the site in Balcombe, West Sussex. The operation is expected to cost the taxpayer around £3million. Protest: Only a few activists, pictured, arrived to protest at the removal of the equipment today . Action: Three activists speak with police officers who have been drafted in to assist the removal of the drills . Removed: A protestor is arrested by police, pictured, bringing the total number of arrests up to 124 . But rather than a sea of activists - officers today were faced with less than 20 protestors. Just two of those were arrested. Rows of officers from four local forces were stationed outside the entrance to the site - which still has around 50 activists camping outside it - this morning. They then stood guard as the equipment was moved away on the back of HGV lorries. As the drills were driven from from the now infamous site on the outskirts of the village, officers walked beside the lorries while they travelled down the small country lanes. Arrest: Another protestor is removed by police from the site in West Sussex . Guard: Police protect the Cuadrilla fracking equipment as it leaves the site . Protection: Officers then move to surround the equipment as it is taken away on a lorry . At one point, police from Surrey, Thames Valley, Hampshire and the Metropolitan Police, escorted some activists away from the lorries. Some protestors have said they feel they are outnumbered by the large police presence - especially as Cuadrilla have hired security guards with dogs from G4S. The operation is expected to last until Saturday. However it could continue next year as Cuadrilla are applying for planning permission to further assess the levels of underground oil. The site has been in the news since July when Cuadrilla were hired to carry out a period of exploratory drilling. Campaigners flocked to the Balcombe site and camped outside for several weeks to highlight their objection to the controversial method - which involves using high-pressure liquid pumped deep underground to split shale rock and release gas. Presence: Around 100 officers from four forces attended the site . Outnumbered: The massive police presence dwarfed the number of activists . At one point around a hundred police – including trained riot officers –  were brought in to break up one blockade. A total of 124 people have been arrested at the site since the protests began, including Green MP Caroline Lucas. She was charged with public disorder offences after she took part in a sit-in at the site's entrance last month. However, earlier this month Cuadrilla admitted Balcombe was unlikely to become a fracking site. The company  said there are likely to be other more suitable sites instead. It said: The site is unlikely to go into full production. We are not ruling it out completely. The fact is that we have a large licence area and there are likely to be more suitable sites elsewhere.’ At the time Prime Minister David Cameron insisted that every part of the country must be prepared to accept fracking sites to extract shale gas from deep underground.

The father of a 4-year-old boy who accidentally shot and killed his 6-year-old friend while the two were playing was indicted on Thursday by a grand jury on six counts of child endangerment. Anthony Senatore, 33, from Toms River, New Jersey, was arrested in April after his son allegedly shot Brandon Holt, 6, in the head with a .22 calibre rifle. He was charged with endangering the welfare of a minor. Thursday’s indictment by an Ocean Country jury brought no new charges, according to The Star Ledger. Dead: Brandon Holt, 6, was shot in the head in April by his friend who was 4 years old . Sad loss: Brandon and his father, Ron Holt on the beach. The boy was shot accidentally . Accident: Brandon and his 4-year-old friend (not pictured) were playing 'pretend shooting' when the horrific incident happened . Senatore faces five counts of second-degree child endangerment, one count of third-degree child endangerment and a disorderly persons’ offense. The tragic accident happened on April 8 in a quiet residential area of the Ocean County community in New Jersey at a home near the edge of a cul-de-sac. Brandon and Senatore’s son were playing ‘pretend shooting’ when Senatore’s little boy ran into his parents’ bedroom and emerged moments later with the rifle. He went outside where Brandon was sitting in a golf cart. The rifle, authorities said, fired. Brandon was shot in the head. Brandon died the next evening at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune. Fought for his life: The young boy was rushed to hospital but died the next day . Killed: Brandon was shot by Anthony Senatore's .22 calibre rifle, one of five shot guns in Senatore's home . Gone: The Holts say they are glad the case is moving forward but that it will never bring back their son . The family donated Brandon's organs in the hope that something good could come from the tragedy.Brandon’s father, Ron Holt, said at the time: 'We both decided that it would help carry his name, that he's helping somebody.' The charges allege that in addition to the loaded .22 caliber rifle used to fire the fatal shot, a Stevens 12-gauge shotgun, two Harrington & Richardson shotguns and a Remington 12-gauge shotgun were all found unsecured, in close proximity to ammunition and accessible to Senatore’s children, ages 12, 8 and 4. Under New Jersey law, residents do not need to register rifles, but they do need a gun purchaser’s identification card to buy them. It is considered a disorderly persons’ offense if someone fails to secure the weapon or install a trigger lock if a child younger than 16 can gain access to loaded firearms in the home. Illegal: It is an offense to not secure weapons in a home where children younger than 16 can gain access to the loaded firearms . Devastated: Brandon's parents, Ronald and Christine Holt lost their little six-year-old boy. They donated his organs after he died . Anthony Senatore Sr., the boy’s grandfather, offered his condolences to the Holt family, according to the The Star-Ledger earlier this year. ‘My heart - I can’t even express it in words.’ Kevin L. Parsons, an attorney representing the Holts, said the family is happy the case is moving forward, ‘but it doesn’t really heal anything, it doesn’t change anything’.","Anthony Senatore, 33, was arrested in April after the death of six-year-old Brandon Holt .

A man who hurled buckets of human excrement at his neighbours’ property has been jailed. Leslie Collins had made local residents’ lives 'hell' for ten years after he repeatedly ignored court orders and carried on with his noisy and illegal woodworking business in a residential cul-de-sac. The 68-year-old carpenter also waged a spiteful campaign against a couple next door, Michael and Shirley Pollard, by throwing buckets of human excrement mixed with oil and water over the fence into their garden and up the house wall. Collins, of Rockland Rise, Whitwick, . Leicestershire, was jailed for a total of two years and 10 months - of . which he is expected to serve half. He . admitted twice breaching an anti-social behaviour order, relating to . the throwing of human waste, as well as damaging the Pollards’ drainpipe, in March and April this year. Collins . also admitted operating a waste facility - a wood recycling business - . without an environment permit, between February and November last year. After . the hearing at Leicester Crown Court, the Pollards and two other . couples who attended court spoke of their delight at the jail sentence.

Mr Pollard, 68, said: 'In the end I installed a CCTV camera in a tree in the garden that captured him throwing excrement and putting cement down my drain. 'We had nails and glass put on the drive and I must have had 25 punctures over the years.' Another neighbour Joan Elliott, 82, said: 'Now he’s in prison, we’re going to have peace and quiet at last.

'Collins would shout abuse at us and even swore at visiting grandchildren.' Her husband Rodney Walne, 71, said: 'Thankfully, the judge understood how bad it’s been. Collins has got what he deserves.' During the hearing, Tim Green, prosecuting on behalf of the Environment Agency, said: 'It was a deliberate and sustained campaign of anti-social behaviour.

In the heart of Florida's citrus grove region, a small group of elephants are after oranges. At the newly opened National Elephant Center in Fellsmere, Florida, the pachyderms have discovered how to pluck the fruit from the trees with their trunks and pop it into their mouths. Fresh Valencia oranges are not the only thing that makes the 200-acre center unique. It is also the only such site operated by the U.S. zoo community to house displaced elephants. Four African elephants living at the new National Elephant Centre, in the heart of Florida's citrus grove, are eating up to 300 oranges a day from old trees . Scott Krus, left, and Mike Tanton, right, work with a young elephant at the National Elephant Center in Fellsmere, Florida. Four African elephants are now living on 25 acres of the 200-plus acre citrus grove. Officials hope to build a total of five barns across the entire land and house a dozen elephants . The CEO of the National Elephant Center, Jeff Bolling, checks the tusks of one of the four African elephants living on 25 acres in the Florida's citrus grove region. There are estimates that 10% of the entire African elephant population was poached for ivory last year . The center is open to two categories of the mammoth mammals: those sent for a limited stay by zoos that need to temporarily free up space for renovations or breeding; and elephants that need a permanent home when their previous institutional or private owners can no longer care for them. The center's primary goal is to ensure the elephant's long-term survival. The animal is listed as endangered, or at high risk of extinction, in Asia, and vulnerable in Africa. 'There's an estimate that maybe 10 percent of the entire African elephant population was poached for ivory last year,' John Lehnhardt said. 'Give that 10 or 15 years, and there may be nothing left.' Currently residing at the center are four African elephants whose permanent home is Disney's Animal Kingdom, located about an hour north of the refuge. Jeff Bolling, the CEO of the National Elephant Center near Fellsmere, Florida, checks one of the four African elephants. The land is leased from a private citrus grove at $1 per year . The National Elephant Center's executive director, John Lehnhardt, said the climate in central Florida is perfect for elephants . Moyo, a 32-year-old female with only one tusk, was the first to discover and appreciate the oranges. She is accompanied by her calves, 10-year-old Tufani and 5-year-old Tsavo; and Thandi, a 33-year-old female affectionately known as the group's 'auntie'. Tufani is starting to grow up and the older females are trying to move him out of the group, which typically only includes females and calves. Adult males live alone and the center is set up to help him in that rite of passage. 'It's a good place for transitioning for this young boy from his family group while still allowing him to be close to them,' Lehnhardt said. 'They need to go out there and compete with other males. Learn the hierarchy.' The family spends most of its days roaming a 25-acre patch that includes a pond and muddy area. Lehnhardt, who has worked with elephants for four decades at Disney and elsewhere, says he hopes eventually to take advantage of the site's full 225 acres, which he envisions with an education center and five barns to house up to a dozen elephants or more. 'A lot more elephants could live here and live here very well,' he said. The land was leased in September 2011 from a private citrus grove for 40 years at $1 a year. That allows for the bulk of funding, which comes mostly from roughly 70 zoos, to cover construction costs estimated at least $2.4 million, and operating costs that reach about $50,000 a month. Most of the operating expenses pay for supplemental food for the elephants, although the property provides roughly 100 different varieties of plants, almost all of which are edible. The elephants are foraging on them as they would in the wild. An elephant roams a 25 acre compound at the National Elephant Center near Fellsmere, Florida. Officials at the center said many more elephants could live there . One of the four African elephants living at the newly opened National Elephant Center peers out of a fenced enclosure at the center. The primary goal of the center is to support the individual welfare and long-term sustaninablity of elephants, which are on the endangered list . The center's board of directors originally set their sights on a larger, 326-acre parcel in St. Lucie County, but the county wanted to impose limits on the number of elephants on site and require a pledge from the center that it would not use bull hooks on the animals. The hooks look like pokers and are used in some circuses to train and discipline elephants. The center did not make that commitment to get the St. Lucie property but now has in Fellsmere. No bull hooks were seen on the property during a recent visit. The elephants arrived in May — peak orange season — and Lehnhardt says Moyo was the first to discover the fruit. Smelling the trees, she tried to grab one that kept getting away from her. Finally, she sucked the orange with the end of her trunk and put it in her mouth. 'Then you saw her go, ''Oh my God,'' and she started grabbing and shoving oranges down her mouth as fast as she could,' Lehnhardt said. Moyo and her companions roamed from row to row, feeding on roughly 300 oranges each a day, until not a single one remained. Come next spring, they'll be at it again. 'We were surprised about that because generally citrus hasn't been something you feed elephants,' said John Lehnhardt, the center's volunteer executive director. 'We didn't think they would be all that excited, but they discovered how to pick the oranges themselves.' On a recent morning visit, the elephants were called from the habitat to the barn for a bath and medical checkup. Each elephant was brought in separately, through moving steel bars and gates resembling a maze. Jeff Bolling, the center's chief operations officer, held a bucket of food — some elephants were given bite-size Twizzlers — while using a clicker to reinforce their good behavior. All were fed pellet-sized bites of manufactured grain made specifically for elephants. Florida's National Elephant Center is run by the U.S. zoo community to house displaced elephants, mostly on a temporary basis. Some animals will come from zoos during renovations periods or breeding . Close-up of the tusk of one of the four elephants living on the 200 acre National Elephant Center in Florida. There are estimates that 10% of the entire African elephant population was poached for ivory last year. Some believe that if this rate continues there could be no more wild elephants in less than 20 years . 'Good. Steady. Good job,' Bolling told Thandi as she turned to get her other side washed. Bolling has worked with her for 15 years at Disney and the two know each other well. She allowed Bolling to scratch her tongue and throw food in her mouth. 'You're a good girl,' he told her as her worn-out tusks knocked on the steel bars, creating a ringing sound that drowned out the sound of the clicker. With the other elephants, particularly troublemaker Tufani, the caretakers distance themselves at trunk's length for safety, even though both Lenhhardt and Bolling were at Animal Kingdom in Orlando when he was born. Disney will eventually decide whether to take the elephants back, leave them at the center indefinitely or break up the group and send them to other institutions. The situation has drawn some criticism from other animal welfare groups, which say the elephants shouldn't be moved frequently. 'That's really like a revolving door for the elephants,' said Catherine Doyle, director of science, research and advocacy for the Performing Animal Welfare Society in northern California. The eight Asian and African elephants at her sanctuary are there indefinitely. 'If you are really trying to do what's right for an elephant, you would be providing a lifelong home for these animals and you would be trying to establish larger social groups that were stable and permanent.' Some advocates say that if the center starts offering lifelong care for the animals, it could fulfill a need in North America for a place where elephants' health can be monitored and the elderly and neglected properly cared for. 'They would be perfect candidates to retire there,' said Nick Atwood, campaigns coordinator with Animal Rights Foundation of Florida. The center's directors have considered also welcoming other threatened and endangered animals, such as rhinos. For now, though, the focus will remain on elephants. 'This is my retirement giveback to elephants,' Lehnhardt said, a way to help a species that 'was very kind to me over 37 years.' 'They are going to have to carry me out in a box,' Lehnhardt, 65, said, his voice cracking. 'And that day will be great. It would have been very worth it.'","New habit surprises keepers, who don't normally feed the mammals citrus .

Guns, gangs and violence are often the things associated with Grant Theft Auto, but one group of gamers play the smash hit to point something altogether less dangerous than a pistol... a camera. These stunning images may look like they were taken by professionals using quality equpiment but they were actually snapped by a group of photographers gathered into a group on GTA V. Phil Rose, a professional landscape photographer, began taking shots with the game's camera phone app and was so amazed by the level of detail he began uploading his images to the web. Future photography: British born photographer Phil Rose uses GTA V's camera phone feature to take these stunning images. He travels around the massive landscape of the game to find beauty spots before using his real life skills to perfectly frame the pictures. He shared the images on a blog which was shared by gamers. Soon Phil, 45, had requests of tens . of photographers looking to join his Flickr group 'Landscape . photographers of Los Santos and Blaine County', named after the fictional city in which the game is set. The group has a strict policy of no . selfies, shooting and killing images or those of a violent or sexual . reference, eliminating some of the traditional features associated with . GTA. Phil, originally from the UK but . currently living in Washington State, USA, hopes his group of snap-happy . gamers can eventually have an in-game get-together when Grand Theft . Auto's online mode is activated in the coming weeks. Camera community: Although these pictures are all taken by the 45-year-old, who lives in Washington, GTA photography has taken off since the launch of the latest game. Phil said he has been inundated with requests from other players who want to join his 'posse', Landscape . photographers of Los Santos and Blaine County . He said: 'It is pretty close to the . experience of taking photographs with a camera phone - no exposure . control, minimal zoom but at least there's a rule-of-thirds overlay. 'I wish there were in store camera . shops as there are gun shops. I want to be able to buy a replica of my . Pentax K5ii so I can do HDR or even under or over expose images. 'I want to be able to blur headlights or freeze a leaping deer . Keeping it clean: The rules of Phil's in-game photography club are very strict with no . selfies, shooting and killing images or those of a violent or sexual . reference allowed. He said by banning some of the scene's normally associated with GTA, they can show how the game can be used for more cultured pursuits. 'I made the group because I realised I . could make realistic images and art. I'm fascinated by the future of . gaming and I see that it will become more and more like reality, and I . think this is one minor way of pushing that forward. 'The game is beautiful, spacious, . interesting, hilarious. 'There is no reason that one . shouldn't be able to put together a 'posse' in-game, which is dedicated . to wandering the hills of Blaine County and chatting via Bluetooth . headsets about life, the universe and photography, whilst taking . pictures and even giving composition suggestions.' Real life: Professional snapper Phil Rose, above, did not have any zoom, aperture or exposure control in the game, so he had to rely on his trained eye to see the perfect picture. The GTA fan is now hoping that game developers Rock Star will introduce more camera features so that gamers can enjoy culture as well as crime.","Pro photographer Phil Rose uses character's camera phone to take snaps .

A Florida police officer who forced a young woman to lift her shirt and shake out her bra during a routine traffic stop has been suspended without pay for one day. The punishment was handed down to Lakeland Police Officer Dustin Fetz Wednesday after video of the May 21 traffic stop of Zoe Brugger sparked outrage in Lakeland and across the country. Despite search tactics that the State's Attorney called 'highly questionable' and 'demeaning,' the a Lakeland police investigation found that Fetz didn't violate the department's strip-search policy. He was technically suspended not for making Miss Brugger shake out her bra, but instead for not using his microphone to record audio during the traffic stop - or for several previous stops he made, according to the Lakeland Ledger. Scroll down for video . Pulled over: Lakeland Police Officer Dustin Fetz pulled over Zoe Brugger for a broken headlight, and was convinced that she was hiding drugs - which prompted the strange search . Contraband: After being pulled over for a broken headlight in Lakeland, Florida, Zoe Brugger had to shake out her bra twice while the police officer searched for drugs - an action that State Attorney Jerry Hill calls 'highly questionable' and 'demeaning' Shake down: Officer Fetz didn't find any drugs on Brugger, or in the car . Excruciating: At the end of the search, Brugger says that the officer told her 'I'm done scaring you, and now you can go home' Miss Brugger, who had given birth to a . baby boy just days earlier, can be seen crying as she lifts her shirt . in dashcam video of the traffic search. Officers found no evidence of . drugs or other illegal substances when they pulled Miss Brugger and . boyfriend Larry Fields over this spring for having only one working . headlight. Brugger told ABC Action News that Fetz 'made me go through the whole humiliating ordeal with shaking my bra out, right there in the middle of this parking lot on Beacon Road.' When no drugs appeared, Fetz 'told me that he was taking me to Bartow jail for driving on a suspended license and that they had an x-ray machine there and they were definitely going to find what I had hidden inside of me,' Brugger said. Brugger was driving on an invalid license, which was enough reason to arrest her. But Fetz didn't. Instead he asked to search the vehicle, and when the couple relented, he searched it anyway. Another office who showed up as backup considered the search improper. Fetz broke another rule during the stop by leaving the audio off in the dash camera. If the audio had been turned on, 'there would be little to no speculation as to what occurred during that traffic stop,' said State Attorney Investigator Mike Brown. At the end of the stop, Fetz told Brugger 'I'm done scaring you, and now you can do home,' she told The News Herald. After the incident, she filed a complaint and notified the State Attorney's Office. Bold: Brugger, left, had just returned from picking up her boyfriend from work. He was in the car the whole time Officer Fetz searched Brugger . State Attorney Jerry Hill called for an investigation and wrote a critical letter to the Lakeland Police Department saying that the search was 'highly questionable' and not only 'demeaning' but 'ineffective and possibly dangerous.' He cited the fact that, if Brugger had been concealing a weapon, asking her to shake out her bra would have just given her access to that weapon. Fetz, on the other hand, told investigators that the search method 'is a known technique that is used by some LPD officers though he can't recall formally being trained to use it. 'Looking back on the incident (Fetz) recognizes that he was overzealous in his attempt to locate illegal drugs or contraband in the car,' Brown said. Fetz was put on a four day suspension with pay during the investigation and returned to work on June 18. The Lakeland Police Department will now be conducting their own investigation of the incident, in order to determine whether or not to terminate Fetz. 'This department does not condone the alleged actions as have been reported in recent days and any officer proven to be involved in this type of behavior will be dealt with accordingly, including possible termination,' Lakeland Police Chief Lisa Womack said in a statement.","Zoe Brugger was pulled over for a broken headlight, when the officer suspected there were drugs in the vehicle .

A Missouri lawyer has been accused of posting nude pictures of a Virginia prosecutor to Twitter after they broke up. Denise Lunsford, the elected prosecutor for Albermarle County, has filed for a retraining order against David Cosgrove, claiming that the St Louis lawyer harassed her after they split in August. Lunsford, who has been in a lengthy relationship with another man despite her illicit meetings with Cosgrove over an 11-month period, claimed she did not even know the images had been taken. Cosgrove has countered that she not only knew the photographs had been taken, but she even went through the pictures to delete the most unflattering and keep the best ones. In court: Missouri lawyer David Cosgrove, left, allegedly posted nude images of Virginia prosecutor Denise Lunsford on Twitter after they broke up earlier this year. She is filing for a restraining order . She has asked that Cosgrove be . required to stay away from her, stop communicating with her and stop . posting her image or name on social media. A hearing is scheduled for . October 3. In her complaint, . Lunsford said she and Cosgrove dated in the late 1980s while attending . Washington & Lee School of Law and rekindled the relationship last . September. After the relationship began again, they had . a dozen romantic rendezvous in various cities including Louisville, . Lexington, Washington, D.C., and on Captiva Island, Florida. NBC 29 reported that the meetings came even though she is in a 'longstanding relationship' with another man in Virginia. The couple is not married. Lunsford said that when the most . recent relationship ended, Cosgrove posted nude photos of her on his . Twitter account, which have since been removed. They were not included . in court documents. Lunsford, 49, said she was unaware that most of the photos had been taken. Accused: Cosgrove allegedly shared the images on Twitter, but they have since been deleted. Lunsford said she was not even aware of them being taken but Cosgrove has argued that she edited them . She added that Cosgrove phoned, texted and emailed her so much after their relationship ended that she had to change her phone number. Her St. Louis County attorney, Susan Roach, said he also started posting other disturbing images such as one of a bloodied female figure. Questionable: Cosgrove accused Lunsford of staying friends with Albemarle County supervisor Chris Dumler after he'd been charged with forcible sodomy . 'I can't think of anything too much more unsettling,' Roach said. 'I think it's very disturbing.' Neither Cosgrove nor his attorney, Michael Downey, responded to phone messages left Wednesday seeking comment. But in his response to the Lunsford's filing, Cosgrove called the allegations baseless and said he would seek sanctions against her and Roach. Cosgrove said in his response that Lunsford knew he took the nude and semi-nude photos of her that he posted online and even went through the images to delete the most unflattering ones. He accuses Lunsford of abusing the protective order process by trying to use it to punish him and to protect her political ambitions. The documents from Cosgrove also accuse his former flame of continuing a friendship with former Albemarle County supervisor Chris Dumler after he'd been charged with forcible sodomy. He claims that Lunsford even invited Dumler and his girlfriend to her home, where they watched an R-rated movie with Lunsford and her children - calling into question her professional ethics, he said. Cosgrove was once former Governor Bob Holden's chief legal counsel. He was also an assistant attorney general in Missouri from 1993 to 1999, then worked for three years as chief consumer protection prosecutor for the Massachusetts Attorney General's office, according to his law firm's website. Lunsford was elected Albemarle County Commonwealth's attorney in 2007 and re-elected in 2011.

As the bitter civil war in Syria rages, these photos show just how desperate the rebels are to fight back against the government. A makeshift rocket - compiled of debris scavenged from the rubble-strewn streets - shows a crowd of Free Syrian Army fighters frantically trying to construct weapons in their fight against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. A gas canister and a scaffold pole have been hastily assembled and carted along in the back of a tractor, before the battered container is launched into the air. Free Syrian Army fighters prepare to fire a home-made rocket in Ashrafieh, Aleppo . Their desperate measures to retaliate come after the British government has announced a further £100 million in humanitarian funding . Children run past the men, some of whom are in uniforms, others in their civilian clothes and trainers, who gather around their home-made weapon in Ashrafieh, Aleppo. The rebels, who want to overthrow their defiant leader, have continued to wage war in a battle that began with a nationwide uprising in 2011. Since then thousands have been killed, deadly chemical weapons deployed and continuous fighting in the streets. Despite the ongoing fighting, pain and global uproar at the pain and suffering caused to innocent civilians, neither the rebels nor Assad refuse to back down in their quest to control the country. Desperate measure: A Free Syrian Army fighter rides a tractor as he moves a home-made cannon in Ashrafieh, Aleppo . The rebels' army's desperate measures to retaliate come after the British government has announced a further £100 million ($160.7 million) in humanitarian funding to help bring food, water and medicine to those affected by Syria's civil war. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced the funding Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, saying that as the international community seeks a political solution to the crisis, it mustn't ignore the needs of ordinary Syrians. He said there is a 'huge gap' in humanitarian funding for Syria and urged other nations present at the assembly to meet the shortfall. The new funding means Britain has now committed 500 million pounds to the Syrian humanitarian crisis. One day earlier, the U.S. announced $339 million in additional humanitarian aid to refugees and countries affected by the war. Oxfam's chief executive Mark Goldring said: 'We welcome the UK Government's extremely generous commitment of an extra £100 million of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people. 'This money will make a real difference in getting basics such as food, water and medicine to many vulnerable Syrians.

Bowman did not know the location of the wound. Dead: Paul Oliver of the San Diego Chargers committed suicide on Tuesday night in Georgia . 'Great guy': Former Chargers teammates say Oliver was 'the happiest guy ever' Oliver played for the Chargers from 2007 to 2011.His teammate, Quentin Jammer, now with the Denver Broncos, said Oliver was not the ‘type of guy’ to commit suicide. ‘He was a good friend of mine. Great guy, great guy,’ Jammer told USA Today Sports. He said he had not spoken to Oliver in a while. ‘I wish now I could reach out to him. If I'd have known…’ Jammer said. Oliver played with the Chargers until the 2011 off season, but then was re-signed later that year because of injuries to other players.He also spent time with the New Orleans Saints. Chargers free safety Eric Weddle said he was ‘devastated’. NFL player: Paul Oliver was with the Chargers for four years . Great loss: Eric Weddle of the San Diego Chargers said he is 'devastated' over Oliver's suicide . Good friend: Quentin Jammer of the San Diego Chargers said Oliver was 'not the type' to commit suicide . ‘Words can't really express how as an ex-teammate — I was with him for five years — you have so many memories and so many thoughts.’ The Chargers selected Oliver in the fourth round of the 2007 supplemental draft, and he played in 57 games, with 12 starts. He became a free agent in 2012. An official statement from the team said: 'Everyone in the Chargers family is sad today after hearing the news about Paul. He was part of our family for five years. At just 29 years old, he had a lifetime in front of him.' Oliver was a star cornerback for the University of Georgia, where he had seven interceptions, 114 tackles and three sacks during his three seasons in Athens. He turned pro and entered the supplemental draft after he was ruled academically ineligible before the 2007 season. Georgia coach Mark Richt described Oliver's death as 'heartbreaking', according to USA Today. 'I was crushed this morning when I heard it, quite frankly,' Richt said. 'I haven' t been able to keep it off my mind, to be honest with you. We have to find a way to reach out and help any way we can.' Oliver, who is a native of Kennesaw, Georgia, and a graduate of Harrison High School, played with  the Bulldogs during the 2004-06 seasons. His death comes a year after another Chargers player committed suicide. Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau, who played 20 seasons in the NFL, shot himself in the chest at age 43.

Just a great teammate and great friend.' Oliver is survived by his wife, Chelsea Young, and two children.

Divers have been combing the ship and surrounding areas for the bodies of Italian passenger Maria Grazia Trecarichi and Indian crew member Russel Rebello since the ship was judged sufficiently secure for investigation on Tuesday. Mrs Trecarichi and Mr Rebello are presumed to have drowned along with 30 others when the vessel capsized off the Italian coast in January 2012. Searching: Italian Fire Brigade Divers meet yesterday for an operational briefing to search for Costa Concordia victims . Missing: Yesterday the search resumed for the missing bodies of Maria Grazia Trecarichi and Russel Rebello, whose bodies were never found after the Costa Concordia capsized on January 13 . Last week, following a 19-hour . operation to right the ship, the families of the two remaining missing . victims arrived on the island of Giglio in the hope that their loved . ones' remains would be found. Franco . Gabrielli of Italy’s civil protection agency said the bones had been . discovered in an area that had previously been identified as of major . interest. He said: ‘On first impression they seem to be the remains of the people we are looking for.’ DNA tests are yet to begin, with the Civil Protection agency saying the identification process will take at least a week. The bones were found beneath the ship on the seabed this morning, sources told news agency Adnkronos. As it was: The Costa Concordia lay on its side for more than a year before rescuers were able to move it . Salvage: The capsized cruise liner was brought pulled from the sea bed into its original floating position, shown here in three stages, during the a lengthy 'parbuckling' operation outside Giglio harbour in September. Righted: Crews have been able to go to work on the crippled cruise ship after the 19-hour operation . Moving in: Overseen by Italian police, divers have now been able to access the part of the seabed where the ship once lay . Determined: Ennio Aquilino, the Search Operations Director for Costa Concordia victims co-ordinates the search and rescue effort . Captain Francesco Schettino, pictured leaving a court in Grosseto earlier this week, is charged with manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the ship before all aboard were evacuated . Police . and coast guard divers were in the water between 9am and 11am UK time, . but returned without the remains to inform the prosecutor. They planned . to return to bring up the body or bodies on Thursday afternoon. The brother of Indian waiter Rebello said his entire family was praying that he had been found. He said: ‘I’ve been waiting for a week since they began work on the ship. I’m trying to control myself but I’m very emotional. ‘I’ve . already warned my sister-in-law and my mother and they are praying that . the remains turn out to be those of my brother. It’s important to have a . place to cry and a place to pray.’ Mrs Trecarichi, the last remaining missing passenger, was on the cruise to celebrate . her 50th birthday with her friend Luisa, her daughter Stefania and her . daughter’s friend. The two young people survived. As . the ship sank, Mrs Trecarichi rang her husband, but in a heartbreaking . twist of fate he failed to answer, having gone to bed early. She had not got onto a lifeboat with her daughter because she had returned to her cabin to get a warm jacket. The Sicilian mother-of-one then rang a friend, saying that Stefania was on a boat and she was waiting for the next one. The phone call was then interrupted by a shout: 'My God my God we are sliding into the water.' Her grieving husband Elio Vincenzi spoke last week of his hope that he will finally be able to bring his wife home. He said: ‘I want to bring her home back to Sicily, her homeland.

Tragic: Tributes have poured in for the teenager who killed himself just 12 days before his 16th birthday . The situation had become so bad that single mother had decided to take herself and Todd back to their home town of Edmonton, Alberta, later this year. But before they fled the bullies, tragedy struck on the morning of September 9 when Kim found her son dead in his room after he had taken his own life. Bullied: Todd was targeted at home and in school . Speaking to the Canadian Press Kim told how Todd had received online taunts the night before he died, she said: 'I told him to go to bed and not worry about it.' Todd would not allow his mother to see the contents of his Facebok messages, but having now investigated the types of messages her son had been bombarded with, she said they were 'disgusting'. She continued: 'They have pages and pages of taunts and abuse. 'They were the nastiest things I've ever heard. I can't even repeat — some of the things were just disgusting.' Speaking of her son's character, she said she was unsure why  Todd was the subject of such torment, saying he was 'just a normal kid who wanted to fit in'. According to his mother, the teenager wanted to become a welder and was excited about taking his driver's test on his 16th birthday which was 12 days after his death. He had even showed his mom pictures of his favourite car he hoped to drive someday, a classic Buick Skylark. Kim said the bullying started in the schoolyard but as her son got older, the insults came through his computer and phone. 'It was usually at night when it would happen. There was no peace.', she said. Todd was was a week into Grade 10 at North Battleford Comprehensive High School when he died. Shannon Lessard, a spokeswoman with the Living Sky School Division, said the school were not aware of the bullying as nobody had reported it. Kim Loik said she now wants justice, which includes a criminal charge against the bullies who tormented her child. Heartbroken: Kim Loik, above, wants Canadian politicians to introduce country wide anti-bullying laws . Action: A banner made by Todd's mother to promote the introduction of a Canada-wide anti-bullying law . She also wants laws across Canada which will protect the victims of bullying and their families. She said: 'It can't be province-to-province. It has to be one law preventing this from ever happening again to anybody. 'There's so many kids out there in pain and suffering that deal with this daily and they shouldn't.' Moving: A poem posted on Todd's tribute page by his mother . Kim has since set up a Facebok page in memory of Todd called 'Todd's safe haven'. Among the well wishing posts are some calling for a change in the way bullying his tackled in schools. One, from Leona Sterling, says: 'Hearts hurting for you and your family today. 'We have to do things differently. We must teach our children the value of every human. Todd's eyes are soft and gentle looking. May you find comfort in the gift he was to you.' Another posted: 'Heartfelt condolences to your family. Sending you light, love and strength. You are in my thoughts...may you be at peace now young angel.' Federal Justice Minister Peter MacKay tweeted about the incident, saying: 'More proof that cyberbullying must be addressed. #BullyingHurts'. Federal NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair also talked about the boy's death on Twitter, saying: 'Let's all work together to fight bullying and put an end to these tragedies.' Earlier this week, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall sent Loik an email offering his condolences. He told reporters Wednesday that the province is looking at anti-bullying initiatives, including an online forum where youngsters can report abuse.","Todd Loik was tormented at school and online by vile bullies .

The 64-year-old Fox News anchor explains in an interview on CBS' 60 Minutes that one night he awoke with the title of the book in his head. He says he believes he got that message from the Holy Spirit. Fox News commentator and author Bill O'Reilly (pictured in 2012) has written a new book titled Killing Jesus: A History . O'Reilly says the book is a researched, historic account. Despite its de-emphasis of religion, he is using his special gifts from God in a positive way. The anchor, who is Catholic, says it's all part of God's plan for him. Bill O'Reill's Killing Lincoln was a New York Times best sellerKilling Lincoln by Bill O'Reilly . O'Reilly's interview with Norah O'Donnell will air on the 46th-season premiere of 60 Minutes on Sunday evening. Published by Henry Holt and Co., Killing Jesus follows O'Reilly's two best sellers, Killing Lincoln and Killing Kennedy. O'Reilly's book about Abraham Lincoln was panned by critics in 2011 for spinning a web of mistakes about the former president. He was criticized for the book's lack of references and footnotes to back up its claims. The book was subsequently banned from Ford Theatre bookstores despite riding high on the New York Times best-seller list for two months. O'Reilly has also made headlines in the past over his highly publicized divorce from Maureen McPhilmy. The former couple, who have two children together, divorced in 2011 and became entwined in a bitter custody battle. O'Reilly was accused in March this year of running a smear campaign against his wife of 15 years and even trying to ban her from the Catholic Church, according to Gawker blogger John Cook. The news anchor allegedly told the church that his ex wife was receiving communion even though she'd been divorced and remarried and that she'd been telling their children that her second marriage was valid in the eyes of God. For this, McPhilmy was allegedly reprimanded by her Long Island parish in writing. McPhilmy remarried a Nassau County detective - whose career was also allegedly in jeopardy from O'Reilly's reported smear campaign.

Failed: Jestin Anthony Joseph, 24, went to the McDonald's in Forth Worth and tried to shoot people in the restaurant but his gun misfired . Customers and employees at a McDonald’s restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas, could have been killed in a robbery on Tuesday night if the robber’s gun had not malfunctioned. Jestin Anthony Joseph, 24, of Allen in Collin County, tried to fire his gun multiple times while pointing it directly at people during the failed heist at the McDonald’s at 4800 South Freeway. Fort Worth police say he pulled the trigger at least five times, but the gun did not fire. Police could not explain why the gun didn’t fire inside the store, apart from it being a moment of divine intervention. ‘I’ve never seen anything like that before,’ said Fort Worth Police Sgt Joe Loughman. ‘It must not have been their time to go.’ Joseph went outside the restaurant on two occasions and successfully managed to fire the gun, once into the air and later toward a passing car. Fort Worth Police Sgt. Joe Loughman said at least 15 employees and patrons, including children, were inside the McDonald’s when Joseph entered shortly after 9pm. Loughman said the man walked into the store, first asking for a water cup from a cashier, according to the Star Telegram. After walking to the beverage machine, he pulled out a semiautomatic handgun and pointed it at employees and patrons, demanding their possessions. At least one man tried to wrestle the gun away from the suspect, Loughman said. As people started to run from the restaurant, the man pointed the gun at those inside and pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire. Loughman said the man went outside twice, got his gun to work and fired two rounds in the direction of a passing vehicle. The driver never stopped. Danger at McDonald's: The incident took place at the fast-food restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas, on Tuesday . Behind bars: Joseph is being held on a $500,000 bail at Mansfield Jail on suspicion of five counts of aggravated robbery . The suspect then ran south along the service road toward Interstate 20, tossing the gun as he fled. He was arrested shortly afterward by officers responding to the robbery. No one was reported injured. Joseph was in the Mansfield Jail on Wednesday night on outstanding warrants and on suspicion of five counts of aggravated robbery, with total bail set at $500,000. Joseph’s mother had gone to the Allen police station about four hours before the robbery to tell officers that she feared her son was suicidal. The mother, who asked not to be identified, said she alerted Allen police after her son told her over the phone that people were after him, according to the Star Telegram. ‘He said, “They’re trying to kill me, Mama! I’m going to die tonight! I’m going to die tonight!”’ she said. Serial criminal: Sgt Jon Felty of Allen Police, who has dealt with Joseph in past incidents, says the man is believed to suffer from 'extreme paranoia' She said she believes her son had a mental breakdown, just as his father did a few years ago. She said she believes it runs in his father’s family. ‘The only thing I can say to you is that was not my son yesterday. He was not in his right mind.’ Joseph’s mother said she believes the gun malfunctioned ‘because we were praying’. McDonald’s USA said in a statement: ‘We are extremely grateful that no one was hurt during the situation that occurred on our property Tuesday evening. The safety of our customers and employees is extremely important, and we are fully cooperating with the Fort Worth Police Department in their ongoing investigation.’ Joseph has had run-ins with the law about a half-dozen times since 2005, including for possession of drug paraphernalia and later for assault, according to Sgt. Jon Felty, a spokesman for the Allen Police Department. ‘In some of the other contacts we’ve had with him, he kind of lives a transient lifestyle,’ Felty said. ‘Oftentimes he seems to suffer from extreme paranoia.’ When she heard about the incident involving her son in Fort Worth, Joseph’s mother said she was happy that no one was hurt.","The robber, Jestin Anthony Joseph, 24, pulled the trigger 'at least five times' while pointing directly at people .

Public attack: Trista Reynolds follows her ex Justin DiPietro on Wednesday to demand answers about what happened on the night their daughter Ayla disappeared in 2011 . Trista Reynolds, right, and Phoebe DiPietro yell at each other outside the Cumberland County Courthouse on Wednesday in Portland, Maine. Ms Reynolds confronted her ex outside court about her missing daughter Ayla, who disappeared while in his care two year ago . On leaving the police station, DiPietro looked away from the mob and stayed composed until he eventually took off running. Reynolds and others gave chase before giving up. On Wednesday, DiPietro . pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four days in jail for violating . conditions of his release following his July arrest for . allegedly assaulting an ex in Portland. Prosecutors dropped the assault charge itself, telling the judge that the former girlfriend was uncooperative. Ayla Reynolds disappeared in December 2011 from the Waterville, Maine home where DiPietro, who had custody of her, was living with his mother. Her body has not been found and she is presumed dead. Investigators have said they suspect foul play and that DiPietro and others in the house the night before she was reported missing haven't been totally forthcoming. In hopes of pressuring prosecutors to bring charges against DiPietro, Trista Reynolds for the past two weeks has been releasing details she says police told her about Ayla's blood being found in multiple spots inside the DiPietro home. DiPietro has said he has no idea what happened to his daughter or who is responsible. He declined to comment on Wednesday outside the courthouse. Trista Reynolds, 25, pictured this month, holds a photo of her 20-month-old daughter Ayla as she reveals the details of new evidence photos shown to her by police in Westbrook, Maine . Earlier this week, Trista Reynolds . released new details from evidence photographs taken in the wake of her . daughter's disappearance where she claims blood was spattered on a car . seat and baby doll. In a . statement posted online on Monday, Reynolds provided previously . unreleased details she said police investigators told her about her . daughter's case. Reynolds says she wants the public to appeal to the . state attorney general's office to file charges against DiPietro. Ms Reynolds said in January this year, Maine State Police showed her a slideshow of evidence pictures of blood in different locations at her ex-boyfriend's home. In a statement posted to websites JusticeForAyla and United4Ayla on Monday, Ms Reynolds claims that Ayla’s blood was found in several rooms inside the house, on the sofa and on the little girl's car seat in DiPietro’s vehicle. According to Ms Reynolds, droplets were also found on Ayla's princess slippers and smeared across the face of a baby doll she played with. The mother said it looked as if her daughter had tried to wipe away the blood. Blood was also found on DiPietro's sneakers, according to the statement and on the mattress and sheets in the father's basement bedroom. Ms Reynolds also alleged that police showed her pictures of blood splashes on the floor and walls. Fighting for the truth: Trista Reynolds cradles her one-month-old son Anthony as she discusses the disappearance of her daughter Ayla two years ago . She told BangorDailyNews.com last . week: 'After seeing [the evidence], it has started to settle in my mind . that Ayla more than likely really is deceased and not coming back. I’m . not just able to close my eyes and not see her blood.' Copies of the photographs or other evidence were not given to Ms Reynolds. Maine Deputy Attorney General Bill Stokes says decisions on whether to file charges are based on evidence, not public pressure. Miss Reynolds also has two sons. She gave birth to Anthony last month and has a two-year-old son Raymond. By . revealing details of alleged evidence, Ms Reynolds intends to put pressure on the three people . who were at the home when Ayla disappeared on December 17 - her . ex-boyfriend Justin, his sister Elisha and Justin's girlfriend Courtney Roberts. No one has ever been charged in the case. Justin DiPietro told police that his daughter disappeared during the night. Miss Reynolds was attending a ten-day rehab program at the time her daughter disappeared. The mother also claims that police have failed to keep her up-to-date on developments in her daughter's case.

Maine investigators confirmed that they met with Ms Reynolds in January 2013 but re-iterated that they have 'no reaction' to her decision to speak publicly. The news of the bloodstains last weekend came several days after DiPietro's arrest for violating the conditions of his bail for a . different charge. DiPietro was charged with the domestic . violence assault of his ex-girlfriend Courtney Roberts in July and one . of his bail conditions was that he not use or possess alcohol. Earlier this month he was stopped by traffic police due to his car's expired . inspection sticker. The officer discovered alcohol in the car and he was . brought in.

Ms Reynolds says that police showed her pictures of her daughter's blood that was found in DiPietro's basement, room, and truck. A sample of the blood showed that the toddler's saliva was mixed with it, leading Ms Reynolds to believe that she suffered. Police have not arrested DiPietro . because there is no evidence to prove that he was the one who killed his . daughter but they have said that they do not think it is reasonable to . believe that she is still alive.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:14 EST, 26 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:47 EST, 26 September 2013 . Charles Taylor lost his appeal against a war-crimes conviction today as judges confirmed a 50-year jail term against the former Liberian president. The appeals chamber of the Special Court for Sierra Leone confirmed Taylor's conviction on 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including terrorism, murder, rape and using child soldiers. That makes him the first former head of state convicted by an international court since Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders after the Second World War. Convicted: Former Liberian president Charles . Taylor, left, at the Special Court for Sierra Leone for his . appeal judgment at The Hague today, where judges confirmed his 50-year . sentence for crimes against humanity . He now faces spending the rest of his life behind bars, with the UK among the nations offering to hold the convicted war criminal. If he is sent to Britain he is expected to be a 'category A' inmate suited only for a maximum security prison, with a cost to the British taxpayer of up to £80,000 a year. The court's ruling today comes more than a decade after Taylor helped rebels go on a murderous rampage across war-torn Sierra Leone, raping, murdering and mutilating tens of thousands of innocent victims. 'Brutal violence': Presiding Judge George Gelaga King said Taylor had aided and abetted savage crimes committed by militants in Sierra Leone . Presiding Judge George Gelaga King said Taylor had aided and abetted crimes committed by Revolutionary United Front and Armed Forces Revolutionary Council rebels, while knowing well the kinds of crimes they were committing. 'Their primary purpose was to spread terror. Brutal violence was purposefully unleashed against civilians with the purpose of making them afraid, afraid that there would be more violence if they continued to resist,' he said. 'Governments and the international community were also afraid that unless the RUF and the AFRC demands were met, thousands more killings, mutilations, abductions and rapes of civilians would follow.' Taylor, 65, dressed in a crisp suit, gold coloured tie, gold cufflinks and gold-rimmed lasses, sat impassively throughout the hour-long reading of the appeals judgment at the U.N.-backed court in The Hague. The court found Taylor provided crucial aid to rebels in Sierra Leone during that country's 11-year civil war, which left an estimated 50,000 people dead before its conclusion in 2002. Thousands more were left mutilated in a conflict that became known for its extreme cruelty, as rival rebel groups hacked off the limbs of their victims and carved their groups' initials into opponents. The rebels developed gruesome terms for the mutilations, offering victims the choice of 'long sleeves' or 'short sleeves' - having their hands hacked off or their arms sliced off above the elbow. Prosecutors said he used the proceeds from so-called blood diamonds mined in the conflict zone to finance Taylor's activities, which included advising and helping the rebels. During Taylor's four-year initial trial, judges heard accounts from Sierra Leone civilians who had been mutilated by rebels or who had seen their close relatives murdered. They also heard evidence from supermodel Naomi Campbell, who was questioned about blood diamonds Taylor was accused of having sent to her hotel room. She described the objects she received as looking like 'dirty pebbles.' 'Dirty pebbles': Naomi Campbell is seen holding the bible being sworn in at the Special Court for Sierra Leone, where she was questioned about blood diamonds Taylor was accused of having sent to her hotel room . In Sierra Leone's capital Freetown, victims were jubilant. 'It's a victory for me against tyranny,' said Edward Conteh, , who lost his lower left arm when rebels chopped it off with an axe. 'I'm happy Charles Taylor is behind bars for 50 years because I'm a victim of the war.' 'Impunity must stop in Africa, so I'm very happy over the decision,' he told the Associated Press. 'At 65, I don't know whether he will ever breathe the free air that I do breathe.' Mr Conteh, who today leads an organisation that aids war amputees, said Taylor's sentence closed a chapter but that some 2,000 people still live with amputations and other serious injuries from the war. Many live in abject poverty with little means to support their families. Civil war: In this June 10, 1997 file photo, soldiers from the Revolutionary United Front supported by Taylor ride in a pick-up truck at their base on the outskirts of Freetown, Sierra Leone . The reaction back home: Men gather at a popular downtown Monrovia tea shop known as a hotspot for political debate to watch the announcement of today's appeal verdict . Taylor is the first former head of state convicted by an international war crimes court since the Second World War and Thursday's confirmation was welcomed as underscoring a new era of accountability for heads of state. However, it also appeared to establish duelling sets of jurisprudence at two international courts on opposite sides of The Hague on the question of when senior officials can support one side in another country's civil war - an issue world leaders must consider if they mull over arming rebels in Syria. The Sierra Leone appeals panel rejected a controversial February ruling by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which said that to prove a leader has aided and abetted a crime, the assistance has to be specifically directed at committing a crime. In that case, the former chief of staff of the Yugoslav national army was acquitted of aiding and abetting atrocities by Bosnian Serb forces even though he had sent them arms and other supplies. Taylor's case appeared to swing the pendulum back towards a lower burden of proof for prosecutors. His lawyer complained that the two rulings have created 'entirely chaotic jurisprudence' at international tribunals. If Taylor had been prosecuted by the Yugoslav tribunal 'I dare say the outcome would have been different, and that courthouse is less than 10 kilometres (six miles) away from this courthouse,' Morris Anyah said. But international law expert Michael Scharf, of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, said the ruling 'righted the ship' after the Yugoslav court had made prosecuting leaders who support rebels much more difficult. But Morris Anyah, Taylor's lead . defence lawyer, complained that Taylor had been prosecuted because of a . lack of friends in high places. Referring . to the diplomatic row over action against the regime in Syria, Mr Anyah . said: 'But for two powerful nations, two members of the Security . Council - Russia and China - Bashar Assad would have been charged and . indicted by the International Criminal Court. That is not happening . simply because of political reasons. 'Had . Charles Taylor had as friends any of the five permanent members of the . Security Council ... this case I dare say would probably not have had . the sort of traction it had.' Because . Syria is not a member of the International Criminal Court, only the . Security Council asking the court to investigate could trigger . jurisdiction there. And Taylor's supporters in Liberia remained loyal to the former warlord who was later democratically elected the country's president. The very idea of international courts has come under fire across Africa. The ICC has been accused of neo-colonial meddling in Kenya as it pursues cases against its president and deputy president. 'This is complete international gangsterism,' said Cyril Allen, former secretary general of Liberia's National Patriotic Party. 'The ICC was set up for Africans, to intimidate them and get their resources.' Taylor's brother-in-law Arthur Saye said he was not surprised by the verdict. 'From day one my position has been that the trial of Mr Taylor was orchestrated by the powers that be - the Western powers,' he told the Associated Press. 'This was an international conspiracy.' Several African states are considering withdrawing from the ICC, which has only ever prosecuted Africans.",Judges upheld former Liberian leaders conviction on 11 counts of war crimes .

A Real Housewife has come under fire for promoting 'marital rape' in her book about how to 'keep the romance alive and the home fires burning'. Melissa Gorga who came to fame for her role on Real Housewives of New Jersey has penned a book about her marriage and one portion that her husband Joe contributed is causing outrage. 'Men, I know you think your woman isn't the type who wants to be taken. But trust me, she is. Every girl wants to get her hair pulled once in a while. If your wife says ""no,"" turn her around, and rip her clothes off. She wants to be dominated,' he wrote. 'Women don't realize how easy men are. Just give us what we want.' Outrage: Melissa Gorga's new book talks at length about her sex life with her husband and she says that wives should do everything to please their husband and avoid fights . The couple's sex life is discussed at length in the book by both of the Gorgas, and Melissa advocates both 'real passionate sex and maintenance sex'. 'Maintenance sex keeps the wheels greased, the lines of communication open, and the fights to a minimum,' she wrote, according to Jezebel. Her frequent mentions of fights that are avoided using sex has raised some eyebrows about their tempestuous relationship. 'In the beginning, Joe wanted to have sex every single day, at least once, if not twice or three times…If I didn't give it to him once a day, he'd get upset,' she wrote. Weighing in: Joe Gorga says that even if the woman says no, men should dominate them and force them to have sex . Family values: Gorga (left) is Teresa Guidice's (right) sister-in-law . 'I can do something that pisses him off on a Monday, but if we had sex on Sunday night, it blows over more easily. But if we haven't done it for two days and I give him attitude? It could be a huge fight.' Joe Gorga is the brother of Teresa Giudice, who is another one of the stars on the New Jersey-based reality show. In spite of her tips about how she has to be home when her husband gets home and how she dresses to impress him, Gorga maintains that the book- like their marriage- is all about 'mutual respect'. 'I think it's controversial in many ways because we do really live an old school type of marriage but with a modern twist,' she said in a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight. The Gorgas have three children- two boys and a girl- and Gorga has said that she will be happy to give the book to her daughter when she gets married someday so that she knows how to approach her own marriage. Though her marriage is said to be 'hot and happy', her continual fights with Teresa remain a regular storyline on the reality show. In the beginning, Joe wanted to have sex every single day, at least once, if not twice or three times…If I didn't give it to him once a day, he'd get upset.I can do something that pisses him off on a Monday, but if we had sex on Sunday night, it blows over more easily. But if we haven't done it for two days and I give him attitude? It could be a huge fight. Love: Joe has been at Melissa's side during a number of book appearances . There's real passionate sex and maintenance sex. You need them both for a healthy marriage. Maintenance sex keeps the wheels greased, the lines of communication open, and the fights to a minimum.The way I see it, if a wife is a puttana, her husband will never feel the urge to go outside the marriage to actual whores, or strip clubs. He won't hit on women in bars, or drool over his friend's girlfriends or the secretary. He'll rush home to his wife, who makes sure he'll have a good time (the best time) in the comfort of his own home.Back in our early years, we'd go to the bar, and I'd make the rounds and talk to everyone. When we got home, Joe would say, ""I feel like we didn't hang out. Like you talked to everyone else more."" Now, you might think, ""Why is he so needy?"" He's not. Joe doesn't need me to hold his hand at a party. It's about respect and loyalty…We arrive together. We stay near each other. We leave together. JOE GORGA'S QUOTES FROM THE BOOK: . Men, .

Benedict XVI has emerged from his self-imposed silence of seven months to deny covering up the sexually abusive priests scandal and defend Christianity to non-believers. The emeritus pope released a letter to one of Italy's best-known atheists, which was his first work published since he retired - and his first-ever denial of personal responsibility for the sex scandal. But what made the letter published yesterday in Italy's La Repubblica more remarkable was that it appeared just two weeks after Pope Francis penned a similar note to the newspaper's atheist editor. In and out: Pope Francis (left) and Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI pray together in Castel Gandolfo, Italy, in March . It gives evidence that the two men in white, who live across the Vatican gardens from one another, are of the same mind about the need for such dialogue and may even be collaborating on it. The Vatican said the letters’ appearance was just a coincidence. Benedict wrote his to mathematician and atheist Piergiorgio Odifreddi, who in 2011 penned a book titled ‘Dear Pope, I'm Writing to You.’ The book was Mr Odifreddi's reaction to Benedict's classic ‘Introduction to Christianity’. In his book, Mr Odifreddi posed a series of arguments about Catholicism, including the sex abuse scandal. For nearly a quarter of a century, the former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger headed the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican office responsible for handling abuse cases. He was prefect when the scandal first exploded in the US in 2002 and was pope when it erupted on a global scale in 2010 with revelations of thousands of victims in Europe and beyond. It emerged bishops had covered up for paedophile priests and Vatican officials turned a blind eye to the crimes - in some cases actively interfering with bishops trying to report paedophiles to police. In his letter, Benedict denies responsibility. ‘I never tried to cover these things up,’ he wrote. Greetings: Pope Francis (left) meets Pope Emeritus Benedict (right) XVI in Castel Gandolfo in March. Benedict has emerged from his self-imposed silence to publish a lengthy letter to one of Italy's most well-known atheists . ‘That the power of evil penetrated so far into the interior world of the faith is a suffering that we must bear, but at the same time, we must do everything to prevent it from repeating,’ he wrote, according to Repubblica. ‘Neither is it comforting to know that, according to research, the percentage of priests who commit these crimes isn't any higher than the percentage of other similar professions. ‘Regardless, one shouldn't present this deviation as if it were something specific to Catholicism.’ As prefect, Cardinal Ratzinger in 2001 . compelled bishops around the world to send all credible cases of abuse . to his office for review. 'I never tried to cover these things up. That the power of evil penetrated so far into the interior world of the faith is a suffering that we must bear' Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI . He took the move because it had become clear to him that bishops were merely shuffling abusive priests around, rather than subjecting them to church trials. He actually tried in 1988 to get around the cumbersome church trials, asking the Vatican's legal office for quicker ways to permanently remove priests who raped and molested children. But he was rebuffed, with the legal office saying that doing so would compromise the priests' ability to defend themselves. Cardinal Ratzinger was hamstrung by Pope John Paul II's unspoken policy against letting young men leave the priesthood and his overriding concern with preserving the rights of accused clerics, often at the expense of victims. This was a concern formed in part by his experiences in communist-controlled Poland, where priests were often accused of trumped-up charges. Eventually, a year after the abuse scandal exploded in the US, Cardinal Ratzinger pushed through administrative changes in 2003 and 2004 that enabled his office to permanently remove abusers without going through a church trial. Big problem: The former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (left) was hamstrung by the unspoken policy of Pope John Paul II (right) against letting young men leave the priesthood . But that decision came decades after his office began receiving a steady stream of documentation about the scale of abuse in the US - far too late, according to victims. ‘In the church's entire history, no one knew more but did less to protect kids than Benedict,’ said Barbara Dorris, outreach director of the US-based victims' advocacy group SNAP, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. ‘As head of CDF, thousands of cases of predator priests crossed his desk. Did he choose to warn families or call police about even one of those dangerous clerics? No. That, by definition, is a cover-up.’ 'In the church's entire history, no one knew more but did less to protect kids than Benedict' Barbara Dorris, Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests . After the 2010 explosion of abuse cases, the Vatican issued informal guidelines ordering bishops to report suspected abusers to police in countries where it is required. But the Vatican has yet to remove or sanction any bishop who covered up for an abuser. Benedict became the first pope in 600 years to resign when he retired on February 28, setting the stage for the election of Pope Francis two weeks later. Benedict said at the time that he would spend his final years ‘hidden from the world,’ living in a converted monastery tucked behind St. Peter's Basilica, reading and praying. His decision to cloister himself was in part due to his own shy, bookish nature, but also to make clear that he was no longer pope and that his successor was in charge. Benedict has been seen only a handful of times since his retirement and only once with Pope Francis, at an official Vatican ceremony in July. Speaking: Pope Benedict XVI delivers a message and blessing to faithful from the central loggia of St Peter's Basilica after the Easter Holy Mass at the Vatican in April 2012 . A prolific writer, he has published nothing since retiring except for the encyclical ‘The Light of Faith,’ which was signed by Pope Francis but was actually written almost entirely by Benedict. Pope Francis responded in the same pages to a series of questions posed to him by Repubblica's atheist editor in editorials this summer. Pope Francis's letter was clearly not penned by his own hand: It involved language that is much closer to Benedict's style, including arcane references to early church fathers like Tertullian whom only Benedict and a few others at the Vatican have ever cited. But Vatican spokesman, the Reverend . Federico Lombardi, denied the two had collaborated on it. ‘They are . autonomous and distinct initiatives,’ he said. 'If you want to substitute God with Nature, the question remains: What does this Nature consist of?' Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI . In Benedict's letter, he takes Mr Odifreddi to task for what he said was the ‘aggressiveness’ of his book, and responds to many of the arguments with piqued criticism himself. ‘What you say about the figure of Jesus isn't worthy of your scientific standing,’ wrote Benedict, who authored a highly praised, three-volume work on the Jesus Christ during his pontificate. He similarly criticizes Mr Odifreddi's ‘religion of mathematics’ as ‘empty’ since it doesn't even consider three fundamental themes for humanity: freedom, love and evil. On evolution, he wrote: ‘If you want to substitute God with Nature, the question remains: What does this Nature consist of? Nowhere do you define it and it appears rather like an irrational divinity that doesn't explain anything.’ Mr Odifreddi, for his part, wrote in an accompanying piece yesterday that he was stunned to have received the letter, though he said he wrote the book precisely in hopes Benedict might read it. He said he sought, and obtained, Benedict's permission to publish the letter. He planned to re-issue his book with Benedict's letter included, calling the exchange ‘an unprecedented dialogue between a theologian pope and an atheist mathematician, divided in most everything but drawn together by at least one objective: the search for Truth.’","Benedict releases letter to well-known atheist after seven-month silence .

Milan is the the home of high-octane glamour, while London has the edgy young talent - but for the big names, only Paris, the grande dame of fashion, will do. This season's shows got off to a sunny start, courtesy of up-and-coming name Christine Phung whose S/S14 offering was unveiled on a rooftop with stunning views of the Eiffel Tower behind. The collection itself was a composed effort in cobalt, white and grey, with sports-inspired tailoring and loose flowing maxis setting the tone. Vive la France: Christine Phung's S/S14 collection was backdropped by stunning views of the Eiffel Tower . Sheer genius: Chung's vision included plenty of delicate chiffon and a fluid sihouette . Phung, who previously worked for Christophe Lemaire,  Chloé and Vanessa Bruno, has only been designing since 2008 but already has numerous awards to her name - and the new collection showed why. Elsewhere, CSI actor Gary Dourdan appeared on the catwalk at Paris' inaugural Islamic Fashion Festival where Ghea Panggabean, Hindi Mahdi, Hoda Haddad, Tom Abang Saufi and Jonathan Liang unveiled designs tailored for those who want to cover up. But the star of today's show was undoubtedly Phung, whose elegant ensembles shimmered in the warm September sunshine. Talented though Phung is, Paris doesn't really get going until later this week, starting with Rochas tomorrow, where rumours that creative director Marco Zanini is leaving for Schiaparelli have dogged the run-up to the show. Thursday sees the first of the big guns with Lanvin, Carven and Roland Mouret all on the schedule. Alexander Wang is also on the bill with his second collection for Balenciaga and is expected to enjoy a celebrity-studded front row, with Kristen Stewart and Alexa Chung among the names likely to turn out to support the young designer. Composed: Chung's restrained cobalt, white and grey palette helped her collection hang together neatly . Elegant: Full skirts, neatly cropped trousers and beautifully tailored jackets were highlights of Chung's offering . Come the weekend, all eyes will be on Paris as the fashion world's heavyweights take to the runway, beginning with Raf Simons presenting his third collection for Christian Dior. Also on the schedule is Isabel Marant, whose debut collection for H&M will appear in just over a month's time, and Vivienne Westwood, fresh from a typically controversial showing at London Fashion Week. Other names showing in the Parisian capital over the weekend include Jean Paul Gaultier, Chloé, edgy fashion favourite Haider Ackermann and the ever-popular Celine. If that wasn't enough, there's also Givenchy, John Galliano, Kenzo and Loewe to enjoy before Stella McCartney kicks off next week with a show on Monday morning.

They have fought for the best positions on the Nascar track and now two of the sport's drivers are fighting over who owns a racing car hauler. Seven vehicles allegedly stolen from racing driver Jennifer Jo Cobb last year have been removed by police from two garages belonging to Nascar driver Mike Harmon. The removal of the vehicles from Mr Harmon's garage in Catawba County, North Carolina, comes two weeks after he was arrested on a separate charge of breaking into Ms Cobb's property and stealing her car transporter. Denial: Mike Harmon denies stealing a hauler from Ms Cobb's property . Off track: Nascar driver Jennifer Jo Cobb is in dispute with her former business partner . Mr Harmon, who denies he stole the hauler, told WBTV: 'I've never stolen as much as a piece of bubble gum. To be arrested for a felony is ridiculous.' He added: 'Why would you put yourself in harm's way like that?' Until last year the drivers raced on the same side, with Mr Harmon acting as Miss Cobb's team manager when she raced for the Nationwide team. This year however, the 40-year-old from Kansas City is racing in the Camping World Truck Series under her own name - Jennifer Jo Cobb Racing Team. Mr Harmon, who has not been charged with stealing the seven vehicles taken from his garage, is under a judge's order to keep his distance from Ms Cobb. The hauler, valued at $279,000, has still not been found. Rowan District Attorney’s Office investigators have not yet said if charges will be brought against Mr Harmon for the second time this month, according to the Charlotte Observer. Mr Harmon, 55, was not available for comment when the newspaper approached him. Team Cobb: Jennifer Jo Cobb left her old race team last year to start a new one under her own name . At the heart of the missing vehicles saga is a dispute between Ms Cobb and her former JJC Racing business partner David Novak over the ownership of the trailer and racing equipment. The former business partners have been in litigation over the ownership of the team since parting ways in December. Mr Novak cut ties 'personally and professionally' with Ms Cobb in December, according to a statement he released last year. In February Mr Novak had a team van confiscated from Ms Cobb, who has had only one top ten finish in 85 combined starts, when she was making a public appearance with her team in Florida, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. Mr Novak claimed he owned the van and showed documents to police allegedly proving he had made payments and insured the van. Allegations: Mike Harmon practices for the Daytona Speedway earlier this year. Seven vehicles allegedly belonging to Jennifer Cobb were found in his garage this week . Mr Harmon became involved because he had helped arrange Ms Cobb and Mr Novak's venture in 2010. He said he helped Mr Novak collect the trailer, which was taken to Denver, North Carolina, in December. Ms Cobb took the trailer back in January, claiming that it belonged to her. Earlier in the month Mr Harmon told Associated Press: 'I just want to do my racing deal and let them fight it out court. They was in the relationship, this is their fight. Mr Harmon, who is best known for a crash that nearly split his car in two on a practice lap in 2002, described Ms Cobb as 'pure evil' and said: 'She doesn't care about anybody but Jennifer.' Both drivers plan to finish the racing season. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Missing vehicles seized two weeks after charge for stealing a hauler .

The barbaric practice of flattening girls' chests to disguise their sexual development has spread from Africa to the UK, women's campaigners warned today. Girls as young as 10 are having their breasts pounded with hot irons, often by their mothers, to hide the signs of puberty and so protect them against rape and unwanted pregnancy. A traditional practice in Cameroon, experts are now warning that it has spread to Britain where it is being practised behind closed doors in families of Cameroonian extraction. The practice of breast-ironing pubescent Cameroonian girls is said to have spread to Britain - their mothers want to delay sexual advances on their daughters so they can get an education (file picture) Today women's charity CAMEWomen's and Girls' Development Organisation (CAWOGIDO) is holding a conference in London on the painful, unpleasant and often dangerous custom. The charity's Margaret Nyuydzewira said breast-ironing, as it is known, is often used when a girl's breast develop early, and is done in private, between the girl and her mother. 'Of course it's happening in the UK, but like everywhere else, no-one wants to talk about it,' she said. Ms Nyuydzewira told MailOnline: 'I am an African woman living in a Cameroonian community in London and it is happening in my community but no-one talks about it. 'Mothers are doing it to their daughters and telling them it is for their own good, because they believe that. 'Their daughters are not reporting it so no-one talks about it.' She said the practice, which is not illegal in Cameroon, was happening 'behind closed doors' in the UK and needed to be stopped before it became widespread. Cameroonian women: The custom of breast-ironing is said to be practised by mothers on their daughters . She said: 'It is harmful, but we are told it is a cultural practice.  This is what they said about female genital mutilation (FGM) at first, but now it is admitted that that is wrong.  We need the same to happen for breast-ironing' Ms Nyuydzewira said she was contacted by a police officer who arrested a woman for breast-ironing her daughter. She said: 'There was a discussion of the laws were and she was released in the end because it was a cultural practice, but I say if it harms kids then it should be against the law.' The Association of Chief Police Officers . (ACPO) said the practice was known to them, and that any reports of it . would be treated as a form of child abuse and passed to the Crown . Prosecution Service so a case could be built. As well as being excruciatingly painful, breast-ironing can cause problems including burns, abscesses, an inability to breastfeed, cysts and permanent disfigurement. Britain's Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, says it is 'only a matter of time' before a prosecution over female genital mutilation is brought . It also damages the girl's confidence. The campaigner added: 'I have seen girls become shy and withdrawn because of it.  They are too afraid to get undressed in front of anyone because they have been so disfigured.' There are more than 200 ethnic groups in Cameroon with different customs, but all of them are said practise breast-ironing, using hot objects including stones or coconut shells. The aim is to make the girls less desirable to men, and thereby protect them from unwanted sexual advances, disease or even pregnancy. In a country where marriage at 13 is common, mothers mutilate their daughters to give them a chance of studying for longer. The UN, which estimates that 3.8m pubescent girls are affected by the custom, says the practice is more common in the Christian and animist south of Cameroon than in the Muslim north, because Christian mothers are keener to see their daughters educated before they are married off. Female genital mutilation (FGM), or female circumsion, in which a young girl's clitoris is cut off because it gives sexual pleasure, is illegal in the UK but affects thousands of young girls here, according to research. One report said 2,000 girls had sought help at London hospitals in just three years after undergoing FGM. A practice associated with communities in Africa, particularly Mali, Somalia, Sudan and Kenya, its defenders say it is a cultural ritual.  But it leaves young girls in pain, disfigured, open to infection and unable to enjoy sex. Earlier this month Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said it was 'only a matter of time' before a prosecution was brought for FGM. 'I think a prosecution is much closer now than it's been at any stage since this was made a criminal offence in this country,' he said.","Pubescent girls' chests are flattened protect them from rape or pregnancy .

Glamorous cigarette packaging tempts young people who have never smoked to take up the habit, research suggests. A Cancer Research UK funded study found youngsters preferred novelty packaging to plain packs. It comes after research earlier this month from the same department at the University of Stirling found that putting graphic warnings on the back of cigarette packs had little impact on teen smokers. Glamorous cigarette packaging tempts young people who have never smoked to take up the habit while plain packets deter them, research suggests . That study found that teenagers' ability to recall images depicting diseased lungs, rotten teeth and neck cancer, was less than 10 per cent, while three written warnings on the back of packs with no supporting images were recalled by less than one per cent of more than 1,000 teenagers. The new research, published in the journal BMJ Open, examined the reactions of 1,025 UK children aged 11 to 16 who had never tried smoking. They were given three different types of cigarette packs: regular, novelty and plain, standardised packs. Novelty packs included those with an unusual shape, colour or system of opening, while standardised packs were brown with all branding removed apart from a brand name. Researchers found that children preferred the colourful and novelty packs from leading manufacturers. They included Silk Cut Superslim's slim pack shape, the Marlborough Bright Leaf pack which opens at the side in the style of a Zippo lighter, and Pall Mall's bright pink pack. Children who liked these packs were the same children who said they were more tempted to smoke, the study also found. In . one example, those receptive to the Silk Cut pack were more than four . times as likely to be susceptible to smoking than those who were not . receptive to this pack. Less than 10 per cent of teenagers can recall the graphic pictures on cigarette packets . In contrast, plain, standardised packaging reduced the appeal of smoking to the youngsters. In July, the Government denied claims it had caved in to the tobacco industry after it put plans to introduce plain cigarette packaging on hold. A decision has been delayed so more time can be spent examining how similar plans are working in Australia. Cancer Research UK said the delay meant the ‘tobacco industry is reaping the benefits of slickly designed packs that help to recruit new smokers’. Almost 570 children under-16 start smoking in the UK every day. Dr Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said: ‘This study provides further evidence that the more attractive the tobacco packaging, the more likely children are to be tempted to light up their first cigarette - the first step to a deadly addiction which will kill half of them if they become long-term smokers. ‘The Government must protect children from the lure of sophisticated marketing and show its priority is the health of young people, not the profits of the tobacco industry. ‘We urge the Government to introduce plain, standardised tobacco packaging to reduce the number of young people who take up smoking.’ Professor Gerard Hastings, Cancer Research UK's social marketing expert at the University of Stirling, said: ‘This research continues to build the case to protect vulnerable children from the might of the tobacco industry's marketing. ‘The UK must follow the lead of Australia and introduce plain, standardised packs as soon as possible. ‘Meanwhile we mustn't overlook the likelihood of the tobacco industry to seek new marketing opportunities within the pack, and to develop soft looking and special coatings to sex-up packs. ‘The tobacco industry is desperately turning to any measures available to peddle its products and secure profits from the smokers of the future. ‘We must act now to de-glamorise this deadly habit.’","Young people prefer novelty cigarette packets to plain ones .

Pressure: More women have been turning to surgery to help them get back into shape after giving birth . For lots of women, returning to work after childbirth once meant worrying about a new wardrobe for their post-pregnancy figure. Now, many think it’s a surgeon’s job to get them back in shape – and quickly. Fearful of returning to work in anything other than a slimline state, growing numbers of new mothers are going under the knife to speedily regain their pre-pregnancy look. Many are even signing up for ‘two-in-one’ tummy tuck and breast lift surgery, inspired by celebrity mothers who seem to snap back into shape soon after giving birth. And some are paying up to £10,000 for the package, which was once the preserve of the rich and famous. Judy Evans, a consultant plastic surgeon at the Circle hospital in Bath, said the two-in-one package is becoming ‘incredibly popular’ with women who are about to return to work after maternity leave. They have time to have surgery – but not enough to have two separate operations, she told a plastic surgery conference yesterday. However, would-be patients are warned that their bodies will not return to normal instantly and that major surgery requires several weeks of recovery. Raj Ragoowansi, a Harley Street cosmetic surgeon, said the number of middle-class women coming to him for ‘yummy mummy tummy tucks’ has doubled in the last five years. He told the annual conference of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons’: ‘Middle-class mums are realising it is a great way of rejuvenating and re-invigorating yourself. ‘After pregnancy, women want to tighten up those bits that tend to go a bit saggy. That is perfectly natural.’ Popular: One plastic surgeon says the number of women visiting his clinic for tummy tucks has doubled in the last five years (library image) Surgeons say women should wait at least nine months after childbirth before deciding on cosmetic procedures. Hormonal fluctuations can lead to women making decisions they would later regret, while breast surgery can make it difficult to breast feed. And women must never sign up to have cosmetic surgery at the same time as a Caesarean section, they warn. Those who rush into cosmetic surgery may also find their cash has been wasted if they decide to have another baby. Mr Ragoowansi added: ‘If you have the surgery and then have another child the chances are you will need to have it done again. ‘It is best to wait until after you have had all the children you want and then after nine months come to a surgeon.’","Many new mothers are signing up for a £10,000 'two-in-one' tummy tuck and breast lift to get back in shape .

Two brothers who were imprisoned for 25 years for the murder of a Detroit marijuana dealer and released last year only to await a retrial and possible re-imprisonment have now had their names cleared for good. The murder charges against Raymond, 47, and Thomas Highers, 48, will be dismissed thanks to a lack of evidence pinning them to the 1987 crime. The case is expected to be officially dropped Thursday by Wayne County, Michigan Circuit Court Judge Lawrence Talon, the same judge who ordered the brothers be released after a quarter century in prison on August 13, 2012 after new evidence warranted a retrial. Initial release: Michael and Scott Highers hug their long imprisoned brother Thomas after he and Raymond's 2012 release . Free and clear: Raymond Highers and his brother Thomas walk out of Wayne County Dickerson prison after 25 years behind bars . Talon ordered a new trial for the brothers and let them out on bond after new witness testimony suggested they may have been misidentified in the 1987 slaying of 65-year-old Robert Karey in his east side Detroit home. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy appealed the ruling to the state Court of Appeals, which declined to reverse it. The case was scheduled for trial on Oct. 8. ‘Just as we did 26 years ago, we firmly believe in the evidence in this case,’ Worthy said Wednesday in a release. ‘We have worked diligently to bring this case to trial. With the passage of time it is an unfortunate reality that this case cannot be put back together and we must dismiss it.’ The brothers got the news that their 26-year-long saga was over from their attorney. Raymond was at work while Tommy was having lunch with his girlfriend. Joyce Fox hugs Raymond Highers, center, as Tom Highers watches after they were released on bond pending a new trial from Dickerson Detention Facility in Detroit in 2012 . The brothers were convicted of killing a 65-year-old drug dealer in 1987, but a new witness came forward in 2012 discounting original testimony. This week, the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office decided not to retry . Justice: 'Being able to correct an injustice, there¿s no greater feeling,' defense attorney Valerie Newman said.'They would have died in prison. It¿s a testament to the human character that they hold no bitterness.' ‘I’m just elated,’ Tommy told the Detroit Free Press. ‘It means a fresh start for me. It means freedom for me to do the things I want to do, to visit family in other states. I have no felony conviction on my record.’ His little brother, of course, agreed. ‘It means freedom and life. It’s been a long day coming,’ Raymond said. ‘Over 26 years, we’ve fought for this, and it’s finally here. It’s like being vindicated.’ Karey was shot to death in his home near Detroit's City Airport. The Highers brothers, now 47, were convicted in 1988 in a non-jury trial of felony murder and assault with intent to murder. The case was reopened in March 2012 after a man came forward who said he was one of a few Grosse Pointe North High School graduates at Karey's house the night he was shot. John Hielscher said he was scared at the time to say anything, and didn't learn for two decades that the Highers had been convicted. Two of the former graduates testified in July 2012 that they went to Karey's back door to buy marijuana. They said they were interrupted by several armed black men who rushed into the backyard and ordered them to leave. The Highers are white. Prosecutors had questioned the witnesses' credibility throughout the hearing, suggesting there was a conspiracy to free the Highers brothers. Worthy's decision to seek a dismissal in the case came as a surprise to the brothers, according to Gabi Silver, defense attorney for Thomas Highers. ‘We were geared up and ready for trial,’ Silver told The Associated Press Wednesday afternoon. ‘We're ready. We have all our witnesses lined up. That's not to say that it shouldn't have happened. It should have been dismissed a long time ago.’ Since their release, the Highers are readjusting to life outside prison walls. Both have jobs, she said. ‘I don't think you can ever make up for 20 years behind bars,’ Silver added. ‘You can't give them back their lives. There is nothing that can make up for it.’ 'I¿m just elated,' Thomas, 48, said. 'It means a fresh start for me. It means freedom for me to do the things I want to do, to visit family in other states. I have no felony conviction on my record.'","Detroit brothers Raymond and Thomas Highers, 47 and 48, were wrongly convicted of a 1987 murder of a 65-year-old drug dealer named Robert Karey .

Unconvinced: Christopher Pincher said Mr Miliband’s policy could cost consumers more in the long run . Tory MPs have challenged David Cameron to bring down energy bills by cutting green taxes. Helping smaller firms to compete with the dominant Big Six would also lower prices, they added. This week Ed Miliband pledged to freeze energy bills for two years if Labour wins the next election. The proposal has been savaged by power firms, which saw another £800million wiped from their values yesterday. Christopher Pincher, a Conservative member of the Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee, said Mr Miliband’s policy could cost consumers more in the long run. Controlling bills without controlling wholesale and distribution costs would leave energy firms vulnerable to price spikes for gas and oil, he warned. This could result in them requiring bail-outs. ‘This is what happened in the 1970s,’ he said. ‘British Leyland and British Steel, nationalised industries, made a loss and the Government had to cover it – so the consumer still picks up the tab.’ His committee colleague Peter Lilley, a former Tory cabinet minister, said ministers were ‘aggravating’ the burden of soaring bills with levies to promote the use of renewable energy. Green taxes currently account for about 10 per cent of the average electricity bill. Under government projections this will rise to 33 per cent by 2020. Not impressed: Peter Lilley (left) said ministers were ‘aggravating’ the burden of soaring bills. Andrew Tyrie (right) said such green levies 'put Britain on a crash programme of carbon reduction which is very costly' ‘The only thing that the government directly controls in terms of energy bills are the additional costs imposed through unjustifiable green energy taxes,’ Mr Lilley said. ‘Governments are responsible for all those costs, and yet they pretend price rises are because energy firms are raising profits. 'We need to abandon these attempts to replace carbon with sources of energy which are twice as expensive, and we need to do more to encourage competition.’ Price freeze: Ed Miliband introduced the policy in his flagship speech to the Labour Party conference earlier this week . Andrew Tyrie, Tory chairman of the Treasury select committee, said such green levies - introduced as a result of the Climate Change Act, passed when Mr Miliband was Energy Secretary in 2008 - ‘put Britain on a crash programme of carbon reduction which is very costly.’ He said the legislation, passed with overwhelming cross-party support, was ‘a profound mistake’. Meanwhile, former Tory leadership candidate David Davis and Dominic Raab both called for the Government to invest in a new generation of nuclear power stations. This would increase electricity bills but lead to more homegrown energy, securing Britain’s power supplies. Mr Raab admitted that green subsidies ‘inflate bills’, but said encouraging competition with initiatives such as group-switching - when large numbers of customers band together to change suppliers - would ‘bring bills down, reduce carbon emissions and strengthen consumer clout against the energy giants’. Energy firms are currently trying to raise private sector funding for £110billion of new infrastructure and nuclear power stations, which they say could be jeopardised by Mr Miliband’s price freeze. When asked about the Labour leader’s speech, Tony Blair said only that it was ‘excellently delivered’, pointedly refusing to comment on its content. Britain's biggest power companies saw a further £800million wiped from their value yesterday in a second day of turmoil. Shares . in British Gas owner Centrica and SSE were punished again in a . relentless investor backlash over Ed Miliband’s election vow to freeze . power prices. The . two companies, which between them supply 21million homes across Britain, . have now seen a staggering £2.8billion stripped from their value in the . past 48 hours. In the day following the Labour leader’s pledge, which . the industry says will increase the likelihood of power cuts, the stock . market values of both groups plunged by £2billion. More than a million . small shareholders will have seen their holdings hammered by the fall. ‘Unfortunately . we see this saga dragging on, with impracticality of the proposals . juxtaposed against their populist nature,’ said respected energy analyst . Angelos Anastasiou at Whitman Howard. Another analyst Peter Atherton, at Liberum, warned of ‘a potentially open-ended loss during the price freeze’. Former business secretary Peter Mandelson went further, suggesting Mr Miliband had taken the party backwards. ‘At the Business Department I tried to move on from the conventional choice in industrial policy between state control and laissez-faire,’ he said. Lord Mandelson, one of the architects of New Labour and its pro-business agenda, came under attack himself from the shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, who called him ‘plain wrong’. She accused the peer of looking after his own financial interests; he is a director of Russian conglomerate Sistema, which operates in the oil industry, and earns a reported £200,000 a year, plus a share of profits. ‘Lord Mandelson may not have to worry about his energy bills, but a lot of consumers and businesses do,’ she said. Three of the Big Six – npower, EDF and Scottish Power – already give customers the chance to fix their own bills until 2017, with npower advertising the offer online with the tagline: ‘Why wait for Ed?’ Under the deals, customers pay above-average bills now, in the hope that price rises will eventually outstrip their premium. Power firms claim that if the Government paid the green taxes instead of consumers, everyone would save money. MPs say that while this would take the heat off energy firms, it would hit consumers just as hard as the money would have to be raised with other taxes.","Tory MPs challenge PM to bring down energy bills by cutting green taxes .

Outside court: Chloe Brennan, 40, insisted at London's High Court that her father's siblings had 'never liked her and didn't want to know her' As the only child of a wealthy diplomat’s son, she was treated like a ‘princess’ by her father and believed he had promised to leave her his fortune. So Chloe Brennan was shocked to learn after he died that his siblings had ‘encouraged’ him to sign a deathbed will they had drawn-up without legal advice which left the bulk of his estate to them. She launched a High Court battle to have the will declared invalid, accusing relatives of her father, Francois Devillebichot, of conspiring to cheat her out of £500,000 of her inheritance. But yesterday a judge threw out her claim, ruling that despite suspicions there was no proof that the will was unlawful. Mrs Brennan, 40, alleged her father’s siblings never liked her because she had ‘shamed’ their respectable family by being born out of wedlock. Her grandfather, Georges Devillebichot, was a French diplomat who lived in London and married an English woman, setting up home in Knightsbridge and raising their four children. But his son Francois went through a hippy stage and was not married to Mrs Brennan’s mother when she was born in 1972, causing his family to resent her, she claimed. Despite this, she said her father ‘treated her like a princess’ and promised on her wedding day that he would leave everything to her. But after he died of throat cancer aged 65 in 2011, she learnt that the will he had signed days earlier left most of his £620,000 estate – including his home in Harrow, North London and flat in Cannes – to his sisters Anne and Lucille, his brother Phillippe and the children of a third sister, Jackie. Property: When her father Francois Devillebichot succumbed to cancer in March 2011, the home-made will was produced, leaving the bulk of his fortune - including Harrow home (pictured) - to his sisters and brother . Involved: Claiming that her father promised to leave her everything on her wedding day, Mrs Brennan accused his sisters Jackie, and Anne (pictured), who is in her 60s, of being 'part of a conspiracy' Mrs Brennan, who had become . financially dependent on her father after she was diagnosed with . multiple sclerosis, was left only £100,000, the High Court was told. She . claimed the siblings exerted ‘undue influence’ on their dying brother . to get him to sign the will. ‘I . am the only child of my father,’ Mrs Brennan said. ‘We had a close . father-daughter relationship. 'He knew of my medical condition and we . discussed financial matters before his death. My father thought he was . leaving his estate to me.’ Evidence: Miss Brennan told London's High Court (pictured) that her father and mother - whom he met in his 'hippy' days - were not married when she was born and felt her existence 'brought shame on the family' Picturesque: Also included in the fortune was a flat in the luxury holiday resort of Cannes in south-east France . She added: ‘The siblings took advantage of my father’s admission to hospital by making and arranging the will. A lawyer does not have to be present when a will is drawn up or altered for it to be legal. Only a few things are required to make a will – or an amendment to it – legal. It must be made voluntarily in writing by someone of sound mind who is over 18. And it has to be signed in the presence of two adult witnesses, who must themselves also both sign the will in the presence of the person making it. The witnesses cannot be beneficiaries of the will. A will can be changed by making an official alteration called a codicil, which must be signed and witnessed in the same way as when it is drawn up, or by making a fresh will. The will should name the beneficiaries and say what should happen if they die before the person making the will. The will should also name the executor. Although lawyers are not a legal requirement, the Government advises getting legal advice unless the will is simple. ‘If . he did sign the will, he was compelled to sign any document put before . him, without ever knowing the full and real contents of it or its . implications. The circumstances around the making of the will raise . suspicion.’ Mrs Brennan, . from Reading, claimed that after her father’s death his siblings refused . to accept that she was his child and she had to undergo DNA testing and . obtain a court order to prove her paternity. But . Luke Harris, for the siblings, fiercely denied this claim and said the . way Mr Devillebichot’s assets were divided was ‘perfectly . understandable’. He said . the £100,000 left to Mrs Brennan ‘reflected his favourable treatment of . his daughter during his life’ and the fact that he was ‘getting tired’ of giving her money. Judge . Mark Herbert QC ruled that despite the ‘colossal distrust’ that blighted . the family, Mrs Brennan’s father had not been subjected to any ‘undue . influence’ and knew what he was doing when he signed the will. He . recognised that suspicions were raised by the absence of legal advice . and the fact that the will was ‘encouraged and drawn up by members of . the family who stand to benefit under it’. But . dismissing Mrs Brennan’s challenge, the judge said her accusations of . dishonesty were not backed up by evidence that the will had been . executed wrongly according to law.","Chloe Brennan, 40, of Reading, insisted father's siblings 'never liked her'

BT has been accused of ripping off the taxpayer in a £1.2billion government-backed scheme to install broadband in rural areas. After ministers pledged in 2011 that 90 per cent of the UK would have superfast internet by 2015, contracts worth £230million were offered to telecoms firms to take on the mammoth task of connecting areas with few people living in them. But MPs said yesterday that consumers were ‘getting a raw deal despite the generous public subsidy’ and that it had not been in the interests of taxpayers to award all 26 contracts to BT. Claims: BT has 'exploited' its deal to install broadband to rural areas of the UK, a new report has suggested . A report by the Public Accounts Committee found that the lack of competition has driven up prices, while the programme is now two years behind schedule and costing local councils £230million more than the £730million anticipated. A further 18 contracts worth £250million, which are to be awarded in 2015, are also expected to go to BT. The MPs also accused the telecoms firm of exploiting its position by failing to pass on information about which areas of the country will not be covered by the programme, meaning other firms could not come in to offer services. Hit out: Margaret Hodge, Public Accounts Committee chair, said the consumer was failing to get the benefits of healthy competition . And it was criticised for including a clause in its contracts with local authorities that prevent them from disclosing the costs involved to others that are still negotiating their broadband connections. This lack of transparency, the report concluded, meant BT ‘exploited its quasi-monopoly position’ to limit access to both the wholesale and retail market ‘to the detriment of the consumer’. Margaret Hodge, the committee’s chairman, said: ‘The consumer is failing to get the benefits of healthy competition and BT will end up owning assets created from £1.2billion of public money. BT is supposed to provide at least 90 per cent coverage in rural areas, but it is preventing local authorities from publishing information on the areas the company will and will not cover. ‘Details of speed and coverage in each local project are also being kept confidential, preventing other suppliers from developing schemes aimed at reaching the remaining 10 per cent of premises and stopping communities and others from identifying alternative ways of providing superfast broadband.’ BT’s outgoings are also £200million less than anticipated when the scheme was set up. Mrs Hodge concluded: ‘The lack of transparency over BT’s costs is a serious risk to value for money.’ But . Communications Minister Ed Vaizey denied that BT was ripping off the . country and said it was offering ‘great value for money’. He . said: ‘It is true we are investing £1.2billion in superfast broadband; . it’s not true the costs are out of control. BT’s costs stack up. They . put the money up front. We will see all the invoices BT present. ‘I . don’t anticipate BT trying to pull a fast one. BT is delivering under . our scheme to up to 10,000 homes now; it will deliver to millions of . people over the next two years with the best value-for-money, . government-sponsored broadband scheme you will pretty much find anywhere . in the world.’ Dispute: A BT spokesman said they were 'disturbed' by the report, which they believe was 'wrong' A BT spokesman said: ‘We are disturbed by the report, which we believe is simply wrong and fails to take on board a point-by-point correction we sent to the committee several weeks ago. ‘We have been transparent from the start and willing to invest when others have not. It is mystifying that we are being criticised for accepting onerous terms in exchange for  public subsidy – terms which drove others away. The taxpayer is undoubtedly getting value for money.’ Dominique Lazanski, digital policy analyst at the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘There needs to be far more transparency about BT’s costs, take-up rates and roll-out plans to ensure that taxpayers are not being fleeced and so that other suppliers can get on with filling the black spots not covered by BT. ‘Taxpayers should be deeply concerned that the broadband programme in its current form has seen hundreds of millions of pounds of their money wasted as a result of a centralised, one-size-fits-all scheme for fixed-line only internet connections.’","Ministers pledged in 2011 that 90 per cent of the UK would have broadband .

Increase: The number of adoptions has increased 28 per cent in just two years (library image) Adoptions have risen to a 20-year high of nearly 4,000. The total has increased by more than 28 per cent in just two years following pressure from ministers to relax rules that excluded couples taking a child of a different race. Children’s Minister Ed Timpson said the increase was ‘hugely encouraging’. But charities warned that the adoption process is still taking too long, with the average time a child spends in state care standing at two years and seven months, a figure unchanged in five years. And the number of babies adopted before reaching their first birthday remained below 100. The figures, for the 12 month period ending in March,  showed there were 3,980 children adopted from state care, where they had been living either in children’s homes or with foster parents. Adoptions were up by 510 in a year and 890 since 2011. However, numbers of care orders have also risen by more than 10,000 since the Baby P scandal in 2008 encouraged social workers to remove more children from dangerous homes. According to the 2013 count, there were 68,110 children in care this spring – the highest since adoption records in their present form were started in 1992. Mr Timpson said: ‘It is hugely encouraging that the number of children adopted from care has risen to the highest level yet – but too many children are still waiting too long for stable, loving homes.  More needs to be done to recruit adoptive parents.’ Education Secretary Michael Gove, who was himself adopted at the age of four months, has led the drive to prevent children languishing in state care system. He says children in care are highly likely to fail at school and fall into crime and benefit dependency as adults. Mr Gove has tried to persuade social workers to push for more adoptions in the face of what some critics say is deep-seated prejudice against adoption in council children’s service departments. Positive: Children's Minister Ed Timpson, pictured with his wife Julia above, said the increase was 'hugely encouraging,' but there was still work to do to find many children loving homes . New rules say a child must not be denied adoption because the would-be adopters are not from the same ethnic or cultural background, and adopters should not be turned away because they are the wrong race, age or are too middle class. A spokesman for the Department for . Education said: ‘The Government is radically reforming adoption so that . children who are waiting to be adopted are provided with stable and . loving homes much more swiftly, giving them the opportunity to settle . and bond with their adoptive families.’ Acknowledging . concerns that some children would be better off returned to their . natural parents than adopted, the spokesman added: ‘Adoption is not the . right approach for every child. ‘We . are improving the skills of social workers so they are able to judge . what is best for each child and taking forward comprehensive reforms to . fostering services and children’s residential care.’ Radical: The Department for Education, headed by Gove who was adopted himself, have made several changes to the adoption process, including tackling the issue and rules surrounding mixed race adoption .","For the 12 month period ending in March, 3,980 children were adopted .

The number of private sector workers saving into a company pension has collapsed to 2.7million, the lowest level since records began in 1953, official figures revealed yesterday. The statistics expose the rapid destruction of pension saving in Britain, with a drop of 200,000 in the last year alone. The Office for National Statistics figures mean that, with a private sector workforce of 24.2million, only 11.2 per cent of private sector workers are actively saving into a company pension scheme. Doing the maths: The statistics expose the rapid destruction of pension saving in Britain (file picture) In 1967 – the year that pension saving among private sector workers peaked – the figure was 8.1million, equal to 81 per cent of a private sector workforce of ten million, according to the ONS. The decline is forcing a generation to work-till-they-drop. A record-breaking number are working beyond state pension age. Yesterday the pensions minister said the shocking figures highlight the importance of ‘crucial’ reforms, which force bosses to pay into a pension for their workers. In the public sector, the situation is very different. Of the 5.7million state workers, who have been nicknamed ‘the pensions aristocracy’, 5.1million, or 89.5 per cent, are members of an occupational pension scheme. Recent changes, making them pay more into . their pensions and to retire later, have triggered strikes, including . this week’s four-hour walkout by firemen. Unhappy: Recent changes, making them pay more into their pensions and to retire later, have triggered strikes, including this week's four-hour walkout by firemen (pictured at West Bromwich Community Fire Station) But they still enjoy the most generous type of pension, known as a ‘defined benefit’ scheme. 'The scale of the challenge is clear. Too few people are saving for their retirement, which is why our pension reforms are so crucial' Pensions minister Steve Webb . These schemes promise to pay workers a percentage of their final salary, or an average of their salary over their career, when they retire. But this generous and guaranteed type of pension is almost extinct in the private sector. There, workers are being put into ‘defined contribution’ schemes, which make no guarantees about the size of a pension at retirement, with bosses typically paying far less into the scheme. Since 2000, the number of private sector workers with a gold-plated ‘defined benefit’ pension has crashed from 4.6million to only 1.7million, and is expected to keep falling. Huge challenge: Pensions minister Steve Webb said the figures highlight the importance of 'crucial' reforms . This means that of the 6.8million workers who are paying into a ‘defined benefit’ pension, three-quarters work in the public sector. More than half of homeowners  aged 50 or over plan to use their property to pay for their retirement, a study says. They are known as the ‘home is pension’ generation, or ‘hippies’. Last year, only 28 per cent of homeowners in this age group who are still working said they planned to rely on their homes as their pension, but this has almost doubled to 52 per cent this year, according to the study from insurance firm LV=. On average, their home is worth £258,000. Their options include downsizing to a smaller property or taking out an equity release loan, which ‘releases’ cash from their home. It is only paid back when they die. The study, of 1,014 homeowners, is further evidence of the pensions crisis. The Government is trying to end the pensions crisis by making all bosses pay into a pension for their workers, and requiring them to sign up their workers to a scheme. New rules mean that over the next five years all workers aged between 22 and state pension age who earn more than £9,440 are being ‘automatically enrolled’ into a scheme. Yesterday’s ONS figures do not include the impact of automatic enrolment because the figures relate to April. The automatic enrolment rules did not begin until October. Around 1.6million have been automatically enrolled since October, according to the Department for Work and Pensions. Fewer than 10 per cent are believed to have ‘opted out’. Pensions minister Steve Webb said: ‘The scale of the challenge is clear. Too few people are saving for their retirement, which is why our pension reforms are so crucial.’ The collapse of pensions in the private sector was kick-started by Gordon Brown’s raid in his first Budget as Chancellor in 1997. He abolished the tax credit that pension funds could claim from the Treasury on dividends. It is estimated to have cost them £6billion a year ever since.","The statistics expose the rapid destruction of pension saving in Britain .

'We remain hopeful that the improvements we've seen in his health will continue. 'As a result, I will not be making any official announcement related to my future plans for public office so that I can focus on the continued care and recovery of my father.'

Amanda Holden has made an extraordinary defence of her affair with actor Neil Morrissey, claiming she cheated on her husband because she needed ‘love and affirmation’. The Britain’s Got Talent judge was married to comedian Les Dennis when she began the five-week fling in 2000, but insists that the relationship was ‘not about sex’. She and Dennis split when news of the affair emerged. Although they were briefly reconciled, they separated in 2002 and were divorced the following year. Holden's affair with Morrissey began while filming the BBC drama Happy Birthday Shakespeare . Miss Holden, 42, who is now married to music producer Chris Hughes, has previously described the fall-out from her affair with Morrissey, 51, the star of Men Behaving Badly, as ‘one of the darkest periods of my life’. However, she said that despite his reputation as a hellraiser, she initially fell for him because he was ‘loving and caring’ and said he was wrongly blamed for his role in the scandal. ‘I don’t believe women have affairs for no reason,’ she said. ‘Women don’t seek sex – we seek love and affirmation. If a woman has an affair, there is normally a problem in their marriage. Neil rightly or wrongly got loads of stick. The actress went on to marry Chris Hughes in December, 2008, and they have two children . ‘I feel like it was my fault – I was the one who was married. ‘I want to change the general perception of him, as he was very caring and very loving and very worried about me because I lost so much weight. He used to cook for me and look after me and babysit the dogs.’ Miss Holden met Dennis when she was just 22 and he 38. They were together for four years before marrying in June 1995. She said that following her affair with Morrissey, which began while filming the BBC drama Happy Birthday Shakespeare, she was ‘thrown together’ with him again when she moved out of the home she shared with Dennis. ‘Our relationship continued longer than it would have done had we not been so in the public eye, because we had no one else to turn to,’ she said in an interview in the November issue of Good Housekeeping, which is out today. The actress went on to marry Hughes in December 2008 and they have two children. Dennis also has two children from a subsequent marriage to 42-year-old life coach Claire Nicholson. Speaking previously about her affair with Morrissey, Miss Holden said the backlash was the worst thing that ever happened to her. ‘I found the fall from grace incredibly hard to deal with,’ she said. ‘I can’t bear not to be liked. Then I had an affair and overnight turned into this awful person. ‘There are no hard feelings with Les. I wish him the best but we’ve both moved on.’","The Britain’s Got Talent judge had fling with actor Neil Morrissey in 2000 .

A woman was faced with a 50/50 chance of survival after doctors failed to spot her rare heart condition on two separate occasions. Hollie Sassienie and filmmaker husband Darren, from London, were expecting their first child after 10 years together. It should have been the happiest time of their lives. 'We were really excited. Our baby was planned, we were delighted and our families were over the moon for us,' says Hollie, an entrepreneur and conference organiser for . the Economist, now 32. Hollie Sassienie and filmmaker husband Darren, from London, were expecting their first child after 10 years together . 'We busied ourselves with work, by that time we worked for ourselves from home, planning out the nursery and thinking of names. 'Just before I fell pregnant, I'd been to the doctor as I'd been feeling really quite breathless and was worried that I could never seem to quite catch my breath, but the doctor told me it was anxiety and not to worry.' All Hollie's scans progressed normally and the first half of her pregnancy went without any major problems. But one day, when she was in her 21st week of pregnancy, Hollie suddenly fainted at home. Concerned, she saw her GP who ran a series of tests. Nothing came up as abnormal and she was told to go home and rest. At 29 weeks Hollie passed out six times and had a fit. She went to hospital but was told to go home . By 24 weeks Hollie was extremely breathless. 'I couldn't make it up the stairs without having to sit down half way to try and catch my breath,' she says. 'I couldn't even make it to the toilet in the night without gasping for air. It was really quite scary, but everyone reassured me it was simply the growing baby taking up space and pressing under my ribcage that was making me lose my breath. 'I'm asthmatic anyway so thought that it could have been that having an effect too. 'I saw other mothers in the second trimester looking and feeling great, with bags of energy - not me. I spent more and more time resting. I couldn't walk our dog. It was all I could do to make it out of bed.' At 29 weeks Hollie took a turn for the worse. Over the course of a weekend she passed out six times. and at 5am one Sunday morning she started fitting after trying to make it from the bathroom back to bed. Darren, woken by the noise, rang for an ambulance immediately. Paramedics quickly arrived, checked Hollie over and took her to the local hospital where she was declared well enough to go home and rest. The following day while in bed, Hollie passed out again, vomited and suffered diarrhoea. Admitted to Watford General for a second time, her obstetrician recommended a cardiologist run an echo and ultrasound on her heart to rule out any complications. Hollie was advised that the 29-week-old baby she was carrying would in all likelihood be delivered in 48 hours . The news was bleak. Hollie had pulmonary arterial hypertension, a condition that hardens the arteries from the lungs to the heart. Women suffering it are advised not to fall pregnant as their mortality rate climbs to 50 per cent. Hollie was advised that the 29-week-old baby she was carrying would in all likelihood be delivered by C-section in the next 48 hours to increase her own chances of survival. First, she was rushed to a specialist unit at Hammersmith Hospital some 30 miles away. 'It was scary but I don't think I really realised the seriousness of the condition,' says Hollie. 'It wasn't until I opened my eyes at about 2am in the morning and found my parents, siblings and husband sat round my bed, all with ashen faces, that it started to sink in just how critical my condition was. Hollie responded really well to the infusion of drugs to the heart, so was able to give birth at 34 weeks . 'When the care team explained that I needed to get all my affairs in place as I might not get through the delivery, it really hit home just how ill I actually was. 'Luckily I responded really well to the infusion of drugs they were pumping straight into my heart to reduce its size and give me the best chance of survival.  I was still very breathless, but the signs were improving.' Baby Gabriella was eventually delivered by C-section at 34 weeks, weighing 5lb 2oz. Gabriella, now 14 months old, was taken to the hospital next door, Queen Charlotte's, while Hollie was rushed back to intensive care where she spent the next 10 days. Hollie takes strong medication every day and it's likely she will require a heart and lung transplant in the future . Two women with the same condition had previously died on day five and seven after being diagnosed, but Hollie pulled through that critical period and was allowed home a week later. 'Knowing Gabriella was already home and waiting for me really spurred me on to get better. 'I had to learn to walk again and still had a cocktail of drugs being injected straight into my heart every day, but that feeling of being home is the best ever. Gabriella, now 14 months old, was delivered by C-section at 34 weeks, weighing 5lb 2oz . 'My husband Darren was the only one who really knew how scared I was during that whole time.  He was brilliant and couldn't have been more positive. 'He was talking to specialists and sufferers all over the world to ensure we were armed with all the information we needed. 'His support and the love and care of my family, combined with wanting to meet my baby, gave me the strength I needed to get through that incredibly difficult time.' Hollie takes strong medication every day and it's likely will require a heart and lung transplant in the future. Housebound for the first 10 months after diagnosis, she came up with the idea of Sassy Bloom, a monthly gift box for new mums containing unique, practical and beautiful gifts for mum and baby. 'I am hoping the business will do well so we can give something back and help further the research,' she says. Hollie's life expectancy has increased from 3-5 years to 10 years and more, and recently she was delighted to meet a mother who had lived with the condition for over 20 years. 'Today is a beautiful day. I am well, I have a wonderful daughter, amazing husband and fabulous family and a new business that I manage from home,' says Hollie.","Pregnant Hollie Sassienie started to faint and have fits at 29 weeks .

One of the two British women arrested for drug trafficking in Peru is to plead guilty after striking a deal that could see her walk free from prison in less than three years. Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly, both 20, were caught with £1.5 million worth of cocaine in their suitcases at Lima International Airport on August 6 and insisted they had been forced to carry the drugs. But now Miss Reid has told The Mail on Sunday from her prison cell that she is going to admit travelling to the South American country with the intention of collecting the drugs and smuggling them back to Spain. 'I'm guilty': Melissa Reid is escorted from a court appearance by Peruvian police. She is to admit attempting to smuggle cocaine after striking a deal that could see her walk free from prison in less than three years . Her lawyer has agreed a plea bargain with prosecutors that will see her plead guilty to drugs trafficking in return for a formal sentence of six years and eight months. Miss McCollum Connolly’s lawyer has hinted that she too may plead guilty, and was reported as saying: ‘It could happen.’ Melissa’s family, who feared she could be jailed for up to 25 years, are hopeful that the deal could mean she is freed in as little as two-and-a-half years. They also believe the early guilty plea could pave the way for her to be transferred back to Britain. The two girls, who had been working in Ibiza bars, have said they were forced to carry the cocaine by a British drug gang who threatened them and their families. Now Miss Reid, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, has agreed not to pursue the line of defence that she was kidnapped at gunpoint and forced to carry the drugs. And prosecutors have agreed to drop claims that she was being paid to carry the cocaine. Charges: Miss Reid in cuffs with co-accused Michaella McCollum Connolly. The pair were caught with £1.5million worth of cocaine in their suitcases . It means she is able to plead guilty to the charges without having to admit to being a willing and fully paid-up smuggler. Miss Reid spoke to this newspaper on Friday by phone from the notorious Virgen de Fatima prison in Lima. She said: ‘I am really scared about what I am about to do but I am also relieved that there could be a light at the end of the tunnel. ‘I’m now coming to terms with the fact I am so far away from my family. This is real. After a lot of thought and advice from my lawyer I am going to go in front of the judge and admit I was in possession of the drugs and that I went to Peru to pick up drugs to take to Spain – I am willing to plead guilty to that. ‘I did it under duress, I still maintain that, and I am glad I do not have to say I accepted money to do it. ‘I am aware that I will have a drugs conviction, which could cause me many problems, but I am trying not to focus on that. ‘Pleading guilty is going to enable me to get back to my family in Scotland sooner rather than later. I do not want to be in jail until I’m 35 – I can’t get those years back.’ Miss Reid explained she had protested her innocence at first in the hope that the authorities would be able to track down the gang members but now accepts that is ‘too risky’ a strategy. Pausing to compose herself as her voice faltered with emotion, she continued: ‘I cannot take that chance and face 15 to 25 years in jail after being found guilty at trial. The authorities here have done nothing in terms of trying to get evidence of others involved. We told them what we knew but it is almost like they don’t seem to want to look. It has been so frustrating and disheartening. ‘They don’t believe we were forced and they seem to think it’s our job to find the evidence – but it’s very hard to do that from behind bars. This is the easy way out for them.’ 'I did it under duress, I still maintain that': A photo provided by Peru's National Police shows the moment Miss McCollum Connolly, left, and Miss Reid were detained at the airport in Lima, Peru, trying to return to Spain . It is anticipated that once a plea is offered and accepted, Miss Reid will be moved to Ancon 2 prison, two hours outside Lima. She expressed concern that she may be separated from Michaella, from Northern Ireland, whom she says is ‘like a sister’ to her. She said: ‘We keep each other going.’ Miss Reid is expecting to attend a deposition hearing on September 24 where she will  be asked to admit her guilt in front of a judge. A further court appearance will then be set for one or  two months’ time to formally announce the sentence. A term of six years and eight months is, crucially, below the seven-year limit that entitles prisoners in Peru to a reduction in sentence. It also entitles foreign prisoners to apply for a transfer to their own country. As part of the plea bargain, Miss Reid is expected to be ordered to pay a fine in the region of £5,000 and could also be hit with additional costs. New home: It is anticipated that once a plea is offered and accepted, Miss Reid, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, will be moved to a new cell here, the Ancon 2 prison, two hours outside Lima . Her father Billy, 53, an energy company manager, said yesterday that lawyers had told him the Peruvian system could allow for the eventual sentence to be less than three years . ‘We are considering this as good a result as we could have hoped for,’ he said. Mr Reid, who recently returned from Peru, continued: ‘It seems strange to be happy about the prospect of your 20-year-old daughter being sentenced to six years and eight months in jail, but we are delighted. Crucially, we could start pushing for her to be transferred to Scotland. ‘I am not proud of what has happened but I ask anyone to put themselves in the position of a 19-year-old who was threatened and told their family was at risk, and think how they would have acted. ‘Melissa is a loving, friendly, outgoing person. She has been unfairly introduced to unscrupulous thugs and criminals and did not realise what was going on until it was too late.’ Miss Reid’s lawyer Meyer Fishman confirmed last night that a sentence of six years and eight months was agreed in return for a plea of guilty during his meeting with the prosecutor.

A woman accused of swindling almost £250,000 from an elderly multi-millionairess told police that the money had been given to her as presents. Susan Butt, 48, said cheques she received from Joyce Harrison were gifts to help her set up and run a bar/restaurant with her partner. However, police found records of payments made by Butt’s business to restaurants in London, on car parking in Knightsbridge, on designer clothing and to a scuba diving firm and a marina. Susan Butt at Guildford Crown Court, is accused of taking £250,000 from the late wife of multi-millionaire Peter Harrison, computer tycoon and a vice president of Chelsea football club . Mrs Harrison, who has since died aged 77, was the former wife of computer tycoon and vice-president of Chelsea Football Club, Peter Harrison. Butt said nobody in the Harrison family was aware of the payments, including the Harrison’s’ son-in-law, Peter Lee, who managed the family’s finances, because Mrs Harrison thought they would disapprove. She described the situation as 'secret squirrel'. Yet before she died, in September last year, Mrs Harrison gave a statement to police in which she told officers: 'I feel stupid to have been taken in by Susan Butt. I feel betrayed by her.' Jurors heard that Butt had been the live-in lover of the Harrisons' son, Nicholas and claimed that she had been ill-treated by him. Justin Rouse, defending, said the abuse had forged a bond between his client and Mrs Harrison because the elderly lady had been beaten by her former husband. Jurors heard that Butt had claimed that she had been ill-treated by the Harrisons' son, Nicholas. The court heard Butt and Mrs Harrison forged a bond because the elderly lady had been beaten by her former husband . Prosecutor Ian Acheson said: 'It was this bond of trust that the defendant exploited in order to defraud Mrs Harrison.' Butt is accused of filling in pre-signed blank cheques totalling £237,500, despite already having received £650,000 from Mrs Harrison to buy a house. A total of £174,500 was paid to the account of Pacific Bar & Grill - Butt’s business in Reigate, Surrey. Of that £140,000 was then paid into a savings account. In a police interview read to the court, detectives asked Butt why she had gone to 'Joy' Harrison for more money when she had so much already in a high-interest account. 'How much do you think starting a business costs?', replied Butt. She said spending at restaurants and other visits to upmarket parts of London were visits to clients or suppliers or as research with their restaurant staff. Guildford Crown Court (pictured) heard Mrs Harrison had already given Butt £650,000 to buy a house . Explaining luxury items such as a Hugo Boss suit for her partner and spending at a posh leather goods shop, she said: 'We needed to be smart.' She admitted the company accounts had been used to pay a Scuba company and a marina in March last year but said that it was because she had had the wrong credit card with her on both occasions. 'It has gone straight back into the account afterwards,' she said. 'Where is it shown going back in?' asked the officer. 'It would have been afterwards,' she replied. Talking about the entire situation and the secretive element of it, she insisted: 'It was never a loan because I was never asked to pay it back. 'She never wanted it back. 'She wanted to help us but didn’t want anybody else to bully her.' When officers spoke to Mrs Harrison, who lived in Brockham, Surrey, she told them: 'I had no idea she was writing out cheques to herself or the Pacific Bar & Grill. I was horrified.' She said she and Butt had been friends and that she trusted her to fill in cheques she had already signed, to pay bills. Butt, of Hookwood, Surrey, denies fraud and theft.

Two women accused of drug smuggling in Peru could serve their sentences in the UK if Britain agrees to a transfer, Peruvian prosecutors said. Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum, 20, were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine in their suitcases as they tried to check-in for a flight from Lima to Madrid, on August 6. The women claimed they were kidnapped in Ibiza and forced to carry the drugs by gun-toting Colombian gangsters who threatened them and their families. Indication: The two women accused of drug smuggling might enter guilty pleas to secure transfers to UK jails . But this week, they suggested they would plead guilty in order to secure shorter sentences, after conceding that detectives did not believe their story. They are expected to receive a sentence of six years and eight months if they admit drug trafficking at their next court hearing. Now, Peruvian counter narcotics prosecutor Luis Mendoza has said the women could apply to serve their sentences in Britain. He said: 'It's very possible that they may complete their sentence in the United Kingdom.' Miss Reid's father William, 53, from Glasgow, claimed they would apply for her to be moved to a UK prison at the earliest opportunity, saying: 'We could start pushing for her to be transferred to Scotland.'

Charities warn of dire conditions and claim poorer inmates are forced to prostitute themselves in return for food. However, Miss Reid has compared it to a 'Brownie camp', and said she spent a whole day helping Miss McCollum Connolly to dye her hair brown and take out her hair extensions.

Antonov was, we will see, the primary mover, Mr Baranauskas profited to . a lesser extent, but both these gentleman had bank accounts in a Swiss . bank which has branches in Germany and Zurich. 'Over . the course of the period, securities and cash funds were transferred . from Snoras’ accounts, either owned or at least controlled and managed . by both these gentleman, in vast quantities. 'The core of this case are those unlawful transfers which are known here simply as theft.' He . added: 'There are 33 transfers of either cash funds or securities from . accounts in the name of Snoras bank to accounts owned, managed or . controlled by Mr Antonov or Mr Baranauskas. 'They . stole a colossal amount of money and forged documents purporting to . show that the money had not left Snoras accounts, and gave those . documents to the central bank to give the impression that Snoras had its . head above the water. Antonov, left, and partner Baranauskas, right, are accused of stealing €470million (£396million) in assets and $10million (£6million) cash and squirrelling it away in a network of foreign bank accounts . Accused: Vladimir Antonov (L) former chairman of Portsmouth FC and former director of Snoras Bankis accused of being the main mover in an 'asset-stripping' fraud that crippled the bank . 'But in fact as a result of the actions of these gentleman it was below the water.' Both men deny the allegations, which they claim are part of a political 'conspiracy on the part of the Lithuanian authorities and central bank'. But this was dismissed by Mr Hardy who said it is in fact a 'straight forward and massive case of alleged fraud of a major bank'. He said: 'On or about 22 June 2011 Mr Antonov became de facto chairman of Portsmouth Football Club. He resigned from that position on 29 November. 'You may remember, and this is not to be held against Mr Antonov in any way, but Portsmouth Football Club is a basket case economy. 'But when Mr Antonov resigned he cited from the government in Lithuania. We say that in reality this is a legitimate form of interference if ever there was one.' Snoras . bank employed more than 2,300 people across 250 branches with more than . one million customers before it was nationalised in 2011, the court was . told. The bank owned a 34 . per cent stake in the Lithuania Morning newspaper, the country's best-seller which was part of a media group which also owned a television channel and news website. Antonov and Baranauskas, who are both . fighting extradition, are each accused of five offences of fraud and . theft and are on conditional bail. Their full extradition hearing before District Judge John Zani is expected to last nearly two weeks. James . Lewis QC, defending Antonov, told the court his client would not . receive a fair trial in Lithuania and the European arrest warrants had . been issued for 'political reasons'. 'The pressure is on the Lithuanian authorities to secure a conviction,' he said. 'That . pressure is so great it will not be resisted. The current government of . Lithuania want to remove Mr Antonov for political reasons.' Mr . Lewis said there was an 'anti-Russian sentiment' in Lithuania which had . not been dispelled by the country’s current Conservative government. The Lithuania Morning had run a story from WikiLeaks cables . revealing the Lithuanian government's concerns about Russian influence . in the former Soviet state's mass media, Mr Lewis said. Mr Lewis told the court that politicians in Lithuania 'consistently exploited' a feeling of hostility towards Russian influence. 'One certainly sees the will there to replace political opponents in the media,' he said. An investigation commission in Lithuania - which has similar powers to a British parliamentary select committee - looked into the nationalisation of Snoras bank and found 'no evidence of a decrease in assets,' Mr Lewis said. 'The allegation against Mr Antonov and Mr Baranauskas is they stole securities,' he said. 'You will hear, and it is the case, that they were transferred from an Austrian bank to a Swiss bank and these securities were still in control of Snoras bank. No one said they are gone or they have disappeared.' Both men sat at the back of court in smart suits as the case against them was outlined. They both deny any dishonesty. The extradition hearing, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.","Ex Pompey chairman Vladimir Antonov, 37, and Raimondas Baranauskas, 55, are fighting extradition to Lithuania .

A £200,000-a-year IT boss charged with stabbing his estranged wife and her lover was found hanged in his prison cell amid fears he would be forced to move jails, an inquest heard. Father-of-two Peter Mason, 58, was arrested after Deborah Mason and her new partner Michael Longden were seriously injured outside their shared home. Deborah suffered multiple stab wounds and her boyfriend was stabbed seven times in the horror attack on July 1 last year. Victims: Deborah Mason (left) and her boyfriend Michael Longden (right) were stabbed multiple times outside their home in Ledbury, . Herefordshire, on Sunday. Her estranged husband has been charged with . two counts of attempted murder . But before he could be brought to trial for attempted murder Mason, an IT director for Hewlett Packard, was found dead in his cell at HMP Gloucester. Mason, who had been placed on a number of suicide watches after his arrest, became increasingly anxious at the prospect of leaving the closing prison, an inquest was told. He had been in custody since July 2012 and suffered depression and anxiety issues and dealt with them by escaping to be by himself in his cell. But Mason, who had tried to kill himself three times following the stabbing, had been improving following a course of mental health work and was removed from suicide watch. He had begun participating within the prison with his inmates and had even got a job in the library. But his mood became worse when he was moved from his usual C Wing to A Wing and then worse again when on January 11 he was told the prison was closing. He told staff he was adamant he wanted to 'be left in a cell on his own' and did not want to share with another person, Gloucestershire Coroners Court was told. Custody: Mr Mason, who had two children with Deborah, had been held at HMP Gloucester, pictured, since 2012 . Despite the improvements mental health notes record that Mason’s mood plummeted when he found out he would be moved. The inquest heard he became 'extremely anxious' that he would have to share a cell. Mason was found hanging from his bunk bed on January 19 by a prison officer who was checking the prisoners after night lockdown. A note was found with a picture of the father's children attached near to his body, the inquest heard. Giving evidence mental health nurse Hanna Rigby said one occasion she had been called to see Mason after he had pressed his cell bell asking for assistance. She said: 'He was acutely anxious and very stressed. He was surrounded by all his belongings in bags, and for someone who likes to be in control and order of his belongings I think it was very difficult. 'He was moving around all the bags and his facial expressions were very stressed and very worried. 'He was very worried he would have to share his cell with somebody else as the cell he had been put in had bunkbeds. 'We sat and chatted for a while as I reassured him he would not be sharing a cell. 'He made some comments about how, if he was to share the cell, he might even harm the other person or himself to remove himself from that situation. 'He adamantly denied having thoughts about harming himself though. He wanted to be left in his cell, on his own to his own devices.' Scene: Mrs Mason and Mr Longden were attacked outside their Ledbury home (pictured) In a statement given by Dr Andrew Green, a GP, he said: 'Peter appeared a little unsettled due to the news Gloucester was closing.He was extremely anxious whether he would have to share his cell.' A hand-written pencil note, addressed to his children and friend, was found in a stack of papers under Mason's bed. Officials also found a pair of shoes which had the laces tied into a noose - which is thought he used to practice making the ligature which killed him. In a statement read to the court PC Hannah Mackie said: 'I found a large bundle of letters which appeared to be from his solicitor relating to his case. 'There was one piece of paper, written in pencil and attached to a picture of two children, which appeared to be his own. 'It appeared to be a goodbye note but it did not appear to talk about taking his own life, nor was it dated. 'I also found a pair of prison issue shoes which had the laces tied in nooses with a slip knot in each end. These appeared to be practice knots.' The inquest heard on the night Mason died he asked staff for his medication early, meaning he would not have to leave his cell after the 5pm lockdown. Following the shut down Mason was found hanged in his cell at 6.45pm. The inquest was not told what he used as a noose. Recording a conclusion of suicide the jury foreman told Deputy Coroner Tom Osborne: 'Mr Peter Mason died from pressure to the neck in keeping with hanging on January 19 2013 at HMP Gloucester.

Comedy panel shows may be considered by some as one of the lowest forms of humour - but top comedian David Mitchell insists that they are in fact wittier than sitcoms or sketch shows. The popular funnyman has written his own sketch show and hosted panel programmes as well as appearing in long-running sitcom Peep Show. He said today that of all the forms of comedy, panels give the greatest scope for spontaneous creativity because they are improvised by skilled comedians. Panel show: David Mitchell, who will soon by appearing on Was It Something I Said? with Micky Flanagan and Richard Ayoade, has defended the controversial TV format . Mr Mitchell, whose new panel show is about to debut on Channel 4, was responding to claims by writer Charlie Higson that scripted comedy had been squeezed out of the schedules by cheaper alternatives. The former Fast Show star told Radio Times that there had been no successful sketch shows since Little Britain, adding: 'They are quite expensive to make and panel shows are also cheaper.' But Mr Mitchell, 39, suggested that the rise of panel shows might be no bad thing - despite having made his name in Peep Show and sketch show That Mitchell and Webb Look. He said that his forthcoming show, Was It Something I Said?, provided a level of spontaneity which could not be matched by scripted comedy. Origins: Mr Mitchell first made his name on Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show alongside Robert Webb . Was It Something I Said? (Channel 4): . David Mitchell's new show, also featuring Richard Ayoade and Micky . Flanagan, is based on quotations and premieres on October 6. Would . I Lie to You? (BBC1): The comedian has been a team captain on the show, . in which guests try to discern truth from falsehood, since it started . in 2007. The Bubble . (BBC2): Mr Mitchell hosted the 2010 show in which celebrities were kept . in isolation for a week and then made to work out what had really . happened in the news in their absence. The . Unbelievable Truth (Radio 4): He also presents the long-running radio . show in which guests give made-up lectures mixing lies with true facts. Other . shows: Mr Mitchell has been a popular presence as a guest on QI, Have I . Got News for You, Mock the Week, 8 Out of 10 Cats and The Big Fat Quiz . of the Year. 'There was a quote from Catherine Zeta Jones about playing golf with her husband Michael Douglas,' he told the Independent. 'We essentially all started to imagine the scene of the two of them . playing golf and that was very enjoyable and turned into a really fun . bit of TV. 'It is . moments like that which, for me, justify the existence of panel shows . because no-one would ever have written those words. It purely came out . of that combination of people which proves panel shows can produce funny . TV in a way you could never write into a sitcom or a sketch show and . thereby justifies its place on screen.' The . programme, which debuts next weekend and features Micky Flanagan and . Richard Ayoade as team captains, is based on questions about quotations . and tweets. It is not the first panel show on which Mr Mitchell has regularly featured - he is a team captain on Would I Lie to You?, and hosted BBC2's short-lived The Bubble. In addition, he has been a frequent guest on Britain's most popular panel shows such as Have I Got News for You, Mock the Week, 8 Out of 10 Cats and QI. He said that the key to a good panel show is allowing the guests the space to come up with creative jokes. 'Usually the panellists are people who are bright and want to talk, and you need them to keep talking so you can't slap them down hard because they might go quiet and then you're stuck,' he added. 'You never know in that kind of comic situation where a chat is going and some of the best material comes when things are allowed to run and breathe.'","Fast Show star Charlie Higson claimed panel shows had squeezed out scripted comedy from the schedules .

A baker who owns a cookery school has failed to impress judges in a bread-baking competition - but her seven-year-old daughter rose to the challenge making it through to the final. Katarina Willingham, 34, and her daughter Lola baked two bread rolls each and entered the Tiptree World Bread Awards in London. Less than a week after delivering the freshly-baked dough, the cookery school owner was informed she had not made it through. Talented: Young baker Lola, seven, pipped her cookery-school mother to the post in a bread-making competition . But it turned out her daughter was the star in the family as she progressed to the next round after judges gave her a place in the final. The primary school pupil spent more than two hours carefully baking her two rolls using her Slovakian great-grandmother's homemade recipe. Mrs Willingham, who owns the Lemon & Soul Cookery School in Southampton, Hampshire, was disappointed with her own result but is proud of her daughter. Proud: Mother Katarina Willingham, said while she was disappointed with her result, she is thrilled and proud for her daughter Lola . Write caption here . She said: 'I spotted the competition while browsing online and thought it would be a great idea and a bit of fun if both Lola and I entered.

'It was disappointing to not make it through to the final but I'm over the moon that Lola has progressed in the competition.' Only two contestants were selected for the final that takes place on October 8, where the winner will be treated to a special Waitrose cookery course. Lola has been baking since she was two years old and seems to have risen to the challenge of competitive bread baking. Lola baked 'two brilliant Slovakian sour dough bread rolls' that took her through to the final, her mother said . In the genes: Mrs Willingham's three daughters, from left, Victoria, Nadia and Lola, all enjoy baking and will be supporting Lola in the final round of the competition .

Jailed: Stuart Hall, who was sentenced to prison for indecent assault earlier this year, could be questioned again after new allegations emerged . Stuart Hall is set to be questioned over fresh allegations of sexual assault after a woman complained that he had raped her, it was claimed today. Lancashire Police confirmed that they had received 'further allegations' about the veteran broadcaster, who is currently in jail for indecent assault. The new claims are said to have been made by a woman who told police that Hall, 83, repeatedly raped her when she was a teenager. The former presenter of It's A Knockout was jailed for 15 months in June after he admitted 14 counts of indecent assault against girls as young as nine. Following widespread outrage over the 'unduly lenient' prison term, Hall's sentence was doubled at the Court of Appeal. A police spokesman said: 'We can confirm that we have received further allegations against Mr Hall and we are working closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to determine the most appropriate course of action. It remains an ongoing investigation.' The latest allegations were made by a relative of friends of Hall, according to Sky News. Hall, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, admitted 14 counts of indecent assault against girls aged between nine and 17 over a period of almost 20 years after initially denying the allegations. When Hall's sentence was increased to 30 months, judges criticised his public denials of his victims' claims when he knew he was guilty. Claims: Hall is alleged to have attacked a family friend of his when she was a teenager, according to reports . Host: Hall with Tessa Sanderson and Toyah Willcox during his days as presenter of It's A Knockout . Lord Judge said the court regarded his original denials - describing the claims against him as 'cruel, pernicious and spurious' in a statement made from the steps of a court - as a 'seriously aggravating' feature in the case. He said that when Hall attacked his victims' claims, he knew the truth and, as an expert in the use of the media, was fully alert to the possible advantages of manipulating it. The case was referred to the Court of Appeal by Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who argued that Hall's sentence failed to adequately reflect the gravity of his offending and the public concern about such crimes. In July, it emerged that police had received further allegations against Hall, including a claim that he raped a 12-year-old girl. At least 17 women are said to be suing Hall, who has tried to pay off his victims in out-of-court settlements which have been derided as 'paltry'.

Russian secret services are probing whether exiled tycoon Boris Berezovsky is still alive after faking his death in England, according to an astonishing claim today. The staunch enemy of Vladimir Putin is believed by British police to have committed suicide by hanging in a bathroom at an ex-wife's home in Ascot on March 23. At the time, there was speculation in Britain that he could have been killed in a hit by Russian secret services, and in Moscow that MI5 could have behind his demise. Conspiracy theory: A Russian newspaper published these images of how oligarch Boris Berezovsky might look in disguise as secret services confirmed they are investigating claims he may still be alive . Recent reports in Russia have cited sceptics claiming that his death was staged - possibly by British secret services. And today a Moscow tabloid newspaper claims both the FSB, the country's domestic secret service, and the Investigative Committee, seen as equivalent of the FBI, are probing whether he is still alive. The paper also published bizarre artist's impressions of what Berezovsky might look like in disguise. 'We are seriously considering a version that Berezovsky didn't die,' an anomymous special services source is quoted as saying by Komsomolskaya Pravda, a leading pro-Putin newspaper. 'Our staff have conducted certain investigations which gave us grounds to believe that he is alive.' Enemies: Berezovsky fled Russia soon after Putin was elected Kremlin president in 2000, fearing arrest on charges he claimed were political . There was no immediate official comment today from the FSB and Investigative Committee. Berezovsky, a scheming power behind the vodka throne of Boris Yeltsin, fled Russia soon after Putin was elected Kremlin president in 2000, fearing arrest on charges he claimed were political. Earlier Putin had been his protege. Soon after Berezovsky's death, Putin said that he had received appeals from the tycoon to be allowed to return to Russia, evidently admitting his errors in calling from Britain for the strongman to be toppled. 'It was clear that Berezovsky didn't act alone, but with a help of security service specialists. We are working on versions that British or Israeli security services were involved in mocking it up,' the source was quoted as saying in Komsomolskaya Pravda. Berezovsky's corpse was reported to have been found by his bodyguard who smashed down a bathroom door. Unanswered questions: A police Forensic Investigation Unit on the road leading to Berezovsky's home, where his body was found in a bath on March 24. He is believed to have committed suicide . The source echoes other recent Russian reports in saying that no photographs have emerged of his corpse, and that his coffin was sealed at his May 8 burial, contrary to normal Russian Orthodox funerals. 'There were cases when I organised 'deaths' of people who were scared of revenge, and staged mock funerals,' he said. 'They were very similar to Berezovsky's funeral, with a body in a closed casket, and with his close circle though dressed in mourning colours - in this case there were even mini-skirts -  walking with smiles on their faces.' The colourful father of six was buried in Surrey reportedly with two ex-wives and two long term mistresses present as well as a number of glamorous lovers. The report claimed that with his death, criminal cases against Berezovsky ceased 'as there is no-one to prosecute, so his wealth will not be taken away'. In fact, however, the Russian government and others with claims against him are seeking compensation from his estate on what was left of the fortune of a mathematics professor turned business mogul who was his country's first billionaire after the collapse of the USSR. At the time of his death, it was claimed that Berezovsky - who is believed to have held an Israeli passport in the past, and to have had British citizenship at the time of his death under the name Platon Elinen - had lost all his money. A report by the Sunday Times last weekend claimed that in fact he was worth around £500 million.  In the week before he died, he replaced his will cutting out his first and second wives.","Putin enemy thought to have committed suicide at ex-wife's home in England .

Farmer Chris Pickering, of York, was disgusted when he found the animal in pain on Tuesday and immediately pulled the crossbow out. Cruel: Police are investigating the callous crossbow attack on a small herd of cows which has left one heifer blinded in one eye .

How anybody could shoot a defenceless animal in its eye with a crossbow is unbelievable. 'I got to the field and saw the crossbow just sticking out of her eye. 'I didn't want the crossbow to catch on anything like a hedge and pull her whole eyeball out, so I yanked the crossbow out of the cow's eye. 'We gave her antibiotics and some painkillers to keep her calm. 'I spoke to the vet straight away and . someone came out to look at her last night, and they've said that she . seems to be okay.

The crossbow bolt was fully embedded in the cow's eye socket and Mr Pickering pulled it out himself . 'We're just going to keep a close eye on her and see she's okay. 'We've left her in the field with her friends, as there are five cows altogether, and we thought it would distress her less if we kept things normal. 'These cows are part of a conservation grazing programme in conjunction with Natural England. 'They're on the land to graze rough grass down to make the ground more friendly for birds and other wildlife, to prevent it going back to scrub land.' Will Durrant, a walker who found the cow, said: 'Who in their right mind would shoot an animal with a crossbow? It's ridiculous' The cow is one of a small protected herd grazing land as part of a wildlife conservation programme . Mr Pickering, . who is the farmer responsible for the animals on behalf of BHE .

Rapist: Salvafor Orozco was jailed today for nine years after being convicted of rape . A rapist has been jailed for nine years because of forensic evidence preserved by his victims thanks to an EastEnders storyline 25 years ago. Salvador Orozco, 49, dragged his victim off the street and subjected her to a brutal sexual attack in Gateshead in 1990. He fled to Hawaii and evaded justice for more than two decades, until new technology allowed him to identified and brought back to the UK for trial. During the trial his victim, who was 20 at the time of the attack, told jurors at Newcastle Crown Court that the vital evidence which led to his conviction was only preserved because she remembered an Eastenders storyline. When character Kathy Beale, played by Gillian Taylforth, was raped by James Willmott-Brown, in 1988, her attacker was convicted in part because she knew to write down a comprehensive account, and to avoid washing to preserve evidence on her body. She said: “Kathy had been raped by Willmott-Brown and I remember watching the story. 'I knew I had not to have a shower or bath and I knew it was important to remember as much as I could.' The court heard that during the attack Orozco has put on an oriental accent, saying :'My name’s Sushi. It’s Japanese.' He was living in Gateshead at the time and working as a doorman at a club before making the attack on 17 May not far from Gateshead Metro Station. After the attack the victim rushed . home and her husband discovered her wrapped in a duvet in the living . room, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Inspiration: This scene from a 1988 episode of EastEnders, in which character Kathy Beale is raped by James Willmott-Brown ensured that the victim preserved the evidence of the assault . Her . injuries were so severe that she could not be examined at first but . samples were taken from her which would ultimately lead to the . conviction of Orozco. He was extradited from his home in Hawaii earlier this year on the strength of the forensic evidence, which was able to be used after a cold case review six years ago. At court Orozco claimed that he had had consensual sex with the woman, but he was convicted of rape by the jury. He was cleared of attempted buggery and jurors were unable to reach a decision on a charge of indecent assault. Sentencing today, Judge John Milford said: 'I find it very unlikely that a 20-year-old married woman would choose to engage in consensual relations with a complete stranger that she had just met. 'The complainant to me was an honest woman. You on the other-hand did not give a favourable impression and gave me no doubt about how this started. Attack: The then 20-year-old was on her way home in May 1990 when she claims Orozco dragged her from the Gateshead Metro Station and brutally raped her . 'You grabbed her from behind, dragged her into a yard and detained her against her will in a state of abject terror. The effect this rape has had on the victim was very considerable.

Paul Ward, 19, was sentenced to 14 years for the abuse of a 10-month-old baby with cutlery . A teenage paedophile almost killed a 10-month-old baby boy by abusing him with cutlery. The infant had to undergo emergency surgery and was close to death after the abuse by Paul Ward. The 19-year-old, from Leeds, was jailed for 14 years after being convicted of three counts of assault by penetration of a child under 13 and one charge of wounding with intent at Leeds Crown Court. Judge Neil Clarke told Ward it was 'perhaps the most unpleasant' case of abuse he had come across. The court was told that the child suffered a ruptured bowel in the incident on January 26. He was left bleeding heavily and fitting. The baby had to be revived twice in hospital and now has a colostomy bag. Judge Clarke told Ward: 'On two occasions [the baby] nearly passed away. 'Doctors said the injuries to his bowel were acutely painful. 'It would have been obvious to you that he would have been in distress and severe pain and yet you continued to do it. 'You did that not just intending serious harm, but with a sexual motive. This is perhaps the most unpleasant abuse of a baby that I have ever come across.' Ward denied three charges of assault but was convicted by a jury. He was sentenced to 14 years on September 19 and will initially be sent to a young offenders' institution. The judge also ordered an eight year extension to his licence on release. Detective Inspector Lawrence Bone, of Leeds District Safeguarding Unit, said: 'Ward was found guilty of appalling sexual abuse against a baby that he had been entrusted to care for. Judge told Ward at Leeds Crown Court it was the 'most unpleasant' case of abuse he had come across . 'He is clearly a callous and dangerous individual who has scant regard for the pain and suffering the child has endured. The victim had to undergo emergency surgery and the prognosis remains uncertain. 'This has been a particularly harrowing case for everyone involved to deal and one which required very sensitive and professional handling. 'We hope Ward's imprisonment will help to provide some degree of comfort to the child's family. Ward’s name will be on the sex offender register for life.","Paul Ward, 19, from Leeds, was sentenced to 14 years for abuse .

The United Nations has moved to distance itself from the outspoken Brazilian official who attacked the government’s welfare reforms. Furious Tories branded Raquel Rolnik a ‘loopy Brazilian leftie’ after she flew into the UK to criticise the ‘bedroom tax’ changes to housing benefit. Now the UN has slapped her down, insisting she is not a member of staff and has nothing to do with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Controversy: The UN's Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, Raquel Rolnik, declared: 'My immediate recommendation is that the bedroom tax is abolished' Miss Rolnik’s extraordinary intervention in British politics, claiming cuts to benefits was an infringement of human rights, sparked warnings that she had undermined the impartiality of the UN. In her two-week tour Miss Rolnik, who is the UN special rapporteur on housing, repeatedly borrowed Labour’s favoured description of the policy as a bedroom tax and appeared with campaigners at protest rallies. She also suggested the idea of rent controls in the private sector, condemned the right-to-buy policy on council homes and insisted more public money should be spent on building social housing. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps wrote to Mr Ban demanding an investigation into the official’s conduct. But aides to the Secretary-General have disowned her remarks. Jane Connors, from the Officer of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, insisted Miss Rolnik was in the UK in an ‘independent capacity’ and is ‘neither accountable to nor appointed by’ Mr Ban. Disowned: United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has distanced himself from Miss Rolnik's remarks . In a letter to Mr Shapps she said: ‘Ms Raquel Rolnik is one of 72 independent experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council - the led UN body responsible for human rights – on the basis of their expertise and independence, and following a competitive selection process. ‘As in the case of all mandate holders, Ms Rolnik serves in an independent capacity and in accordance with a Code of Conduct adopted by the Council. ‘She is not a staff member of the United Nations, is neither accountable to nor appointed by the Secretary-General, and does not receive any compensation beyond a daily allowance when engaged in mandated activities.’ Miss Rolnik is expected to submit a final report to the UN in March next year. But the slap down from Mr Ban’s officials will limit the impact of her final recommendations. Mr Shapps said: ‘People expect the UN to be neutral, yet on this occasion a former Workers Party politician came with a clear agenda.’ Ministers say the removal of the ‘spare room subsidy’ brings social housing into line with the private sector where renters do not get spare rooms for free. The change will is expected to save around £500 million every year. Tenants affected by the shake-up will face a 14 per cent cut in housing benefit for the first excess bedroom, and 25 per cent where two or more bedrooms are unused. Ministers, who estimate the average affected household will lose £14 a week, say the policy will save taxpayers £500million a year. They also say it will encourage people to move into smaller properties to relieve pressure on stock, helping families crammed into homes that are too small. During her visit Miss Rolnik revealed a shaky grasp of UK house prices by saying: ‘How many people can afford to buy a £120,000 apartment? Not many.’ MPs pointed out that in Brazil tens of millions of people are condemned to living in shanty towns, or favelas . The Brazilian, who has spent much of her five-year UN post looking at human rights violations in countries including Rwanda, Kazakhstan, and Indonesia, has decided that Britain’s housing system is ‘going backwards’. She said at the end of her visit: ‘My immediate recommendation is that the bedroom tax is abolished. 'I was very shocked to hear how many people feel abused in their human rights by this decision and why - being so vulnerable - they should pay for the cost of the economic downturn, which was brought about by the financial crisis. ‘The right to housing is not about a roof anywhere, at any cost, without any social ties. ‘It is not about reshuffling people according to a snapshot of the number of bedrooms at a given night. 'It is about enabling environments for people to maintain their family and community bonds, their local schools, work places and health services allowing them to exercise other rights, like education, work, food and health.’ The academic, brought up a Marxist, actually offered an animal sacrifice to Karl Marx . Her lengthy CV lists countless . qualifications, civic achievements, books and publications – but Raquel . Rolnik makes no mention of dabbling in witchcraft. Yet . the architect and urban planner appears to be an avid follower of . Candomble, an African-Brazilian religion that originated during the . slave trade.

According to her elder sister .

UN special rapporteur’s fascination with Candomble rekindled memories . of another controversial figure’s links with the religion that worships . African gods. In . 2001, Peter Mandelson was ridiculed when reports emerged that his . Brazilian partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, had engaged a Candomble . witch doctor to put a hex on political enemies in a ceremony involving . the slaughter of a chicken. It . was claimed that the Labour spin doctor – now a peer – held a live . chicken by the neck while a priest in Rio de Janeiro cut off its head, . splashing Mr Mandelson with blood. Mother-of-two .

Polish grandfather died in the Holocaust and her parents emigrated to . Brazil. She has held various government positions, speaks six languages, . and was appointed to her UN post in 2008. In . an interview, her sister Suely gave more clues about Raquel’s . upbringing and background. She said: ‘My little sister –  who is much . younger than me – and I have always felt the same. 'I was born in Belenzinho [a . poor area of Sao Paulo], my parents are immigrants and we never tried to . hide this, we do not feel well in high class, bourgeois places. ‘She . was always brilliant academically.

But the university didn’t . accept her thesis. ‘I greatly admire her work, her courage, the work she is doing with the UN is fantastic, she is very precocious.’ Suely said Raquel came to live with her in Paris in the 1970s and became interested in French philosophers. ‘When she went to do her Masters, she offered an ebo – an animal sacrifice – to Marx, so he would leave her in peace. ‘Because, . as well as having a Marxist formation at the university, when we were . small our parents put us in the Leftist Zionist movement. ‘Raquel had a really solid Marxist formation.

The National Security Agency eavesdropped on civil rights icon Martin Luther King and heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali as well as other leading critics of the Vietnam War in a secret program later deemed 'disreputable,' declassified documents revealed Wednesday. The six-year spying program, dubbed 'Minaret,' had been exposed in the 1970s but the targets of the surveillance had been kept secret until now. The documents showed how the NSA tracked King and his colleague Whitney Young, boxing star Ali, journalists from the New York Times and the Washington Post, and two members of Congress, Senator Frank Church of Idaho and Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee. Huge following: Martin Luther King waves to his supporters on the Mall in Washington DC in 1963, government spies were concerned his activities might have been fueled by foreign powers and so tapped his calls . The declassified NSA historical account of the episode called the spying 'disreputable if not outright illegal.' The documents were published after the government panel overseeing classification ruled in favor of researchers at George Washington University who had long sought the release of the secret papers. The intensity of anti-war dissent at home led President Lyndon Johnson to ask US intelligence agencies in 1967 to find out if some protests were fueled by foreign powers. The NSA worked with other spy agencies to draw up 'watch lists' of anti-war critics and to tap their overseas phone calls. Former heavyweight champ, Muhammad Ali pictured here in 1960, was also considered a threat by the programme which has since been deemed 'disreputable if not outright illegal' The program continued after Richard Nixon entered the White House in 1969, and historians say it reflected a climate of paranoia pervading his presidency. US Attorney General Elliot Richardson shut down the NSA program in 1973, just as the Nixon administration was engulfed in scandal. The 1975 disclosure of the NSA program, along with other domestic spying on Americans, caused public outrage and one of the senators who had been tapped, Church, led reforms that created stricter limits on surveillance and spy agencies. But the NSA has been accused of overstepping its authority and flouting civil rights protections since the attacks of September 11, 2001. The agency carried out warrantless wiretapping between 2001-2004 and recent revelations from US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden have exposed far-reaching electronic surveillance of phone records and Internet traffic. The researchers who published the documents Wednesday said the spying abuses during the Vietnam War era far surpass the excesses of the current program. Matthew Aid and William Burr for George . Washington University's National Security Archive, a research institute . that seeks to check government secrecy added that there is no evidence the NSA still operates in such a way. They wrote: 'As shocking as the recent revelations about the NSA's domestic eavesdropping have been, there has been no evidence so far of today's signal intelligence corps taking a step like this, to monitor the White House's political enemies.'","Ali and King were bugged along with journalists from the New York Times and Washington Post and two members of congress .

Mr Dale's extraordinarily intervention came as Mr McBride was plugging his explosive memoirs Power Trip on ITV's Daybreak on Tuesday morning. Mr Holmes often appears in the background of TV broadcasts, holding up placards campaigning against nuclear power. As he tried to use the interest in the McBride book to further his cause this morning, he came up against Mr Dale, who runs BiteBack, the firm publishing Power Trip. The barking of the protester's dog - which eagerly joined in the commotion - could be heard by TV viewers as the struggle continued. But the terrier - carrying placards reading 'No Nukes' on its back - failed to live up to the loyalty expected from dogs, jumping up and biting its owner on the rear. Sussex Police said a 50-year-old man from Pembury, Kent, voluntarily attended a police station today, admitted common assault and received a police caution. Chief Superintendent Paul Morrison said: 'We respect the rights of people to protest peacefully. We will investigate fairly any allegation regardless of who is involved and we will seek the most appropriate resolution.'

Immediately after the incident Mr Dale remained defiant, writing on Twitter: 'Oh dear, I seem to have gone . nuclear... Mirror photographer tells me I did what the snappers have . wanted to do for years!' But today he struck a more regretful tone, apologising to Mr Holmes as well as his own family, friends, work colleagues and even Labour leader Ed Miliband. Writing on his blog, Mr Dale said: 'I . did apologise personally to Mr Holmes on Tuesday afternoon and we shook . hands. He agreed to let the matter rest, but I have no complaint that . he changed his mind on reflection. 'Since the events of Tuesday I have . gone through what happened over and over again in my mind.

I will . pay for a new placard for him and also make a donation to a charity of . his choice.' Fight: Others piled in to help Mr Dale in his efforts to stop the broadcast being interrupted . Publicity: Protester Mr Holmes is a regular on the media circuit, hoping to see his banners caught on camera . Mr Dale said he has been told by police that they regard the matter as closed and he thanked them for 'the fair and courteous way they have dealt with me throughout'. He went on: 'Above all I want to issue this public apology for my behaviour. 'I want to apologise and say sorry to Stuart Holmes, who is a passionate campaigner and well known to everyone who attends party conferences and was perfectly entitled to do as he did on Tuesday in trying to get attention for his causes. It was totally out of character for me to react to him in the way I did. 'I also want to apologise for the blogpost I wrote after the incident.

Two schoolchildren have been suspended for a year for firing airsoft guns at fellow pupils, prompting anger from their parents who believe the punishment was too severe. Aidan Clark and Khalid Caraballo were among six children involved in an airsoft war in Khalid's parents' front yard when their pellets hit pupils at a nearby school bus stop. The two boys, both 13, and another boy involved who cannot be named, were suspended for a year on Tuesday after a disciplinary hearing where it was claimed the plastic pellets were of sufficient force to cause welts on students who were struck. Aidan Clark and Khalid Caraballo (pictured) were suspended for a year on Tuesday after a disciplinary hearing into them firing airsoft guns at Khalid's mother's home in Virginia. The school made it clear that its investigation found that the children were running in the street, near to the school bus stop, allowing it to claim jurisdiction. But Khalid's mother Solangel Caraballo said the boys were firing the pellet guns on private property and should never have been disciplined by the school system. 'My son is my private property,' she told WAVY.com. 'He does not become the school's property until he goes to the bus stop, gets on the bus, and goes to school.' The boys were firing the off rounds at Khalid's mother's home (pictured) with another four children when they hit pupils at a nearby school bus stop . And Khalid insisted that all the shots were fired on his parents' property. 'It's unfair because we were in our yard,' he said. 'I didn't have anything at school at anytime'. He said all the witnesses for the school's investigation against him were at one point involved in the airsoft war or had visited him on his private property that day. Khalid's two friends, including Aidan, admitted leaving the front yard and chasing each other but insist that Khalid never left his property and that neither of them fired their airsoft pistols in the street. And now Khalid's parents have accused the school of bullying their son after an official released the boy's disciplinary record on Twitter. Angry: Khalid's mother, Solangel Caraballo, (pictured) has slammed Virginia Beach City Public School System, insisting education bosses have no power over her son when he is in her care . Virginia Beach School Board Chairman Daniel Edwards tweeted: 'We can share that this is not Khalid Caraballo's first disciplinary infraction. 'He has been disciplined six times in less than 18 months for increasingly aggressive behavior including harassment, bullying and fighting that resulted in injuries.' Eileen Cox, a spokesman for the . 68,000-student Virginia Beach, Virginia, school system, said it has . responsibility for students' safety to and from school. Matthew Delaney, principal of Larkspur Middle School, said in a written statement that he hoped the suspended students would learn that 'there will be consequences when they do things that can result in harm to another person.'

With the suspension on his school record, Khalid admited he is worried about his future. 'It's terrible. I won't get the chance to go to a good college,' he told WAVY.com. 'It's on your school record. The school said I had possession of a firearm. They aren't going to ask me any questions. They are going to think it was a real gun, and I was trying to hurt someone.'

Facing jail: Pensioner Douglas Bailey, 79, has been told to expect a likely jail sentence after he admitted beating his wife to death with his walking stick last year while he suffered from dementia . An elderly dementia sufferer has admitted beating his 82-year-old wife to death with a walking stick in row over the central heating. Hazel Bailey was found beaten to death in the bedroom of the bungalow where she lived with her husband in Winsford, Cheshire, in September last year. Douglas Bailey, 79, attacked his wife of 50 years with a walking stick after they argued over their finances, police confirmed. Today Bailey pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility at Chester Crown Court. Recorder of Chester, Judge Elgin Edwards, adjourned sentencing after the court heard that both defence and prosecution psychiatrists had agreed that Bailey was 'suffering from dementia at the time'. Judge Edwards said: 'It’s a very troubling, worrying and tragic case from all points of view.' 'Tragedy is by no means too strong a term,' he said. But the judge also warned Bailey, who has been in custody since his arrest: 'No court wants to send a man of 79 to a lengthy custodial sentence, or indeed any custodial sentence. 'But I want to make it quite clear so as not to build up any hopes, it does not mean there will not be a custodial sentence. It depends on the risk to the community. It’s a complex exercise.' The frail-looking defendant, wearing a black jumper and tracksuit bottoms, nodded and said he understood what the judge was saying. The court heard that the case had been delayed for 12 months while psychiatric assessments took place. The judge added: 'Although we have had to go through all these hoops to get here, this is the correct decision. This is manslaughter, not murder.' The full facts of the case were not opened in court but it is understood that the alarm was raised by a neighbour when Bailey, a former builder and wallpaper factory worker, answered the door to a window cleaner who saw that his hands were covered in blood. Det Insp Helen Spooner, from Cheshire Police, said: 'It’s always been the view that in a case like this it is important that we didn’t get a miscarriage of justice. 'If someone is mentally unwell and that explains their actions then they should be dealt with appropriately.' She said specialist medical evidence had been 'very unclear' and had not always agreed, which is what caused the 12-month delay in the case. Chester Crown Court, pictured, heard that the case had been delayed for 12 months while psychiatric assessments took place . She added: 'He has given a clear account to the police of what happened. 'My stance is that clearly Mr Bailey has taken his wife’s life. He gave us a clear account of assaults over a period of time. 'My concern is how we will now manage him if he is released into the community.' The officer said it was 'a very sad case'. The court heard the killing took place between September 4 and September 8 last year. Sentencing was adjourned to October 29 at Chester Crown Court.","Douglas Bailey, 79, attacked his wife of 50 years arguing over finances .

This was on top of a basic salary of between £25,970 and £28,068 a year, according to figures obtained by local newspaper the Ham & High. During the last financial year, repairs staff took home £2,626,534 - a year in which Haringey repairs service (HRS) smashed its budget by an incredible £1.53million. Several staff have now been suspended as the inquiry into the 'level of earnings for some operatives' is carried out, a council source said. Concerned: Lib Dem Councillor Richard Wilson has demanded an investigation to expose the truth . One worker, who did not want to be named, said: 'What they have had to do [to counteract the overspend] is change the way working is done and innocent people have lost their jobs for it.' The bonus system was introduced by Homes for Haringey . in October 2011 to 'improve productivity, quality and residents' satisfaction with repairs'. It is not known how much the repairs service - set up in April 2006 - thought it would pay out when it introduced the scheme in one of the most deprived areas of England. A Homes for Haringey spokesman said the massive budget-busting sum spent in 2012/13 would 'not impact on the repairs service Homes for Haringey offers tenants and leaseholders'. He said: 'During 2012/13, we carried out more than 53,000 repairs on behalf of our tenants and this did lead to an overspend on the repairs budget in 2012/13. 'We have now launched an improvement project - overseen by the Homes for Haringey board and a recently appointed a new senior manager for repairs - that is helping us to drive down costs while continuing to improve customer satisfaction.' But Councillor Richard Wilson, housing spokesman for Haringey's Liberal Democrat opposition, demanded an investigation to expose the truth. Cllr Wilson said: 'I am very concerned . that bonuses paid to repairs staff have soared to more than £2million - . whilst at the same time many local council tenants and leaseholders are . tightening their belts and struggling to make ends meet. 'I have received many complaints from residents about housing repairs not being done promptly or correctly so I am very surprised that such high bonuses have been paid. 'This is public money that should have gone on housing services for local people.' Homes for Haringey manages about 20,000 houses for the council.","Repair workers at Haringey Council in north London have received a staggering £3.7million in bonuses in less than two years .

Downloadable games that encourage children to spend parents' cash to proceed are being probed by the Office of Fair Trading . Video games that pressure children into spending hundreds of pounds when playing online face a crackdown from the Office Of Fair Trading. Many computer, console and mobile phone games offer players the opportunity to buy extra lives or abilities when online. It has led to many parents being left with huge credit card or mobile phone bills. Now an OFT investigation has found children are particularly vulnerable because they could feel they are letting other players down if they do not buy the content. Many games also blurred the distinction between spending virtual currency and real money and used statements or images to encourage children to make a purchase. The investigation found some games included ‘potentially unfair and aggressive commercial practices to which children may be particularly susceptible’. Now the OFT has proposed payments made by children while playing games online will not be deemed authorised, and should not be taken, unless the account holder - such as a parent - has given their informed consent. And they state that consumers should be told upfront about potential costs for playing the games, and any other important information such as whether their personal details will be shared with third parties. But Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, has criticised the OFT proposals as ‘flaccid’. He said: ‘When games like My Little Pony and others charge £69 a pop for children to buy “gems”, there is something almost sinister happening. ‘Many of these free games take advantage of children’s confusion between virtual and real money and some parents’ technical illiteracy. ‘The OFT consultation is flaccid - the problems are apparent and games makers and app stores need to be held to account. Children can unknowingly run up bills of hundreds playing games that have been downloaded for 'free' ‘We need rules that stop bait pricing on games predominantly marketed or targeted at children: wealth warnings both at the start of games and inside app stores to indicate it is an in-app purchase game, and caps put on how much can be spent on such purchases within an hour, which can only be removed by the cardholder.’ The OFT launched its investigation in April following concerns that users could run up substantial costs paying for content such as upgraded membership or virtual currency in forms including coins, gems or fruit. Typically, players can access only certain areas of these games for free and must pay for higher levels or features. OFT executive director Cavendish Elithorn said: ‘This is a new and innovative industry that has grown very rapidly in recent years, but it needs to ensure it is treating consumers fairly and that children are protected. ‘The way the sector has worked with us since we launched our investigation is encouraging, and we’ve already seen some positive changes to its practices. 'These principles provide a clear benchmark for how games makers should be operating. Once they are finalised, we will expect the industry to follow them, or risk enforcement action. ‘In the meantime, we want to hear what parents, consumer groups, industry and anyone else with an interest thinks about our principles before we finalise them later this year. ‘This is a global industry so we’re also sharing our principles with our enforcement partners worldwide with the goal of achieving some common international standards.’ Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the guidelines need to be enforced. She said: ‘The scandal of online games which try to pressure or trick players into making extra purchases must end. We’ve seen parents turning to us after their children inadvertently run up huge bills for downloads, so we welcome the OFT’s moves to clamp down on the practice. ‘After an unexpected £200 bill landed on his doormat, one of our clients assumed he’d been the victim of fraud. But after approaching his bank, he was told that the bill was in fact down to a game his 10-year-old son enjoyed playing. 'He was shocked to be told that as the extra costs were laid out in the small print, the only way to get his money back would be to sue his son. ‘It’s good to see that the OFT are considering action to make games include clear information on costs, and require authorisation for the account holder before children can make in-app purchases. 'The final rules must be backed up by strong enforcement action to ensure that consumers are properly protected.’ A spokesman at the Department of Culture said: ‘We welcome the OFT’s investigation into this very important issue. The Government is committed to ensuring that consumers, and particularly children, are properly protected. ‘We will be studying the OFT findings and proposed remedies and will be interested to see how the industry responds.’ Credit crunch: Will Smith, 6, unwittingly racked up a £2,000 bill on his grandfather's credit card playing Tiny Monsters (pictured) Schoolboy Will Smith, 6, unwittingly racked up a £2,000 credit card bill playing an online game on his grandfather’s iPad.

"PUBLISHED: . 10:26 EST, 26 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:27 EST, 26 September 2013 . Distress: Amanda Hutton, pictured outside court yesterday, wept as a pathologist spoke of finding her 'mummified' son . The mummified corpse of a four-year-old boy who starved to death was found in a cot cuddling his favourite soft toy, a jury heard. Hamzah Khan was found by a policeman in a severe state of decay more than two years after he had died. His body had been kept upstairs by his mother Amanda Hutton, who continued to claim child benefit, and is now on trial at Bradford Crown Court for the manslaughter of her son. Hutton, who wept in the dock for 40 minutes while a pathologist described her son's decayed and malnourished body, yesterday told the court that the boy had starved himself to death. Pathologist Dr Matthew Lyall described to jurors how he was called to examine Hamzah, who weighed less than when he was born, and found evidence that he was malnourished for two years before his death in 2009. He was called to Hutton's terraced house in Bradford, Yorkshire, in September 2011. Jurors later heard how the property was covered in flies and exuded a stench 'almost beyond description'. Dr Lyall said: 'He was lying supine - on his back - accompanied by a soft toy which his right arm was encircling. He was severely decomposed and mummified.' The pathologist said Hamzah was clothed in a babygro for an infant aged six to nine months, and even that was ‘slightly too big for the child’s body.' He said the boy was mummified, having decomposed in dry conditions, with leathery skin and tight, rigid limbs. The child’s body weighed just 4lbs 5oz, his bones were visible beneath the skin, and his duvet was coated in maggots, pupae cases and insects. Flea eggs were on . the child’s hands and head. He agreed there was an “abundant” amount of insects and flies. He said a Hamzah was also wearing a T-shirt for a three or four year old which was 'much too large'. He said he could not be sure of a precise cause of death due to the level of decay, but that all evidence pointed to starvation. 'It seems reasonable to conclude Hamzah Khan was suffering from malnutrition and entirely possible that malnutrition or dehydration could have contributed or, in part, caused his death.' 'Irrespective of the cause of malnutrition I would expect a competent parent to recognise the severe growth retardation evident in the child and seek medical assistance.' The court heard Hamzah was registered with a GP 15 months after he was born but he never saw a doctor before his death. Scroll down for video . Dead: The four-year-old boy's body decomposed for two years before it was recovered by police . A host of experts examined Hamzah’s teeth, hair and bones, and all showed signs of malnourishment. Prof Archibald Malcolm, a histopathologist specialising in bones, found Hamzah was suffering ‘profound’ osteoporosis and said there was no credible explanation other than malnutrition. Forensic anthropologist Dr Julie Roberts evidence Hamzah’s bones of ‘extreme stunting of growth’, which had left the child with the skeleton of a child aged between 12 and 18 months. Paediatric dietician Jacqueline Lowdon said Hamzah’s diet had been ‘grossly inadequate.’ Earlier the court heard Hutton did nothing to alert the emergency services about her son's plight and even ordered pizza within hours of his death, Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, told the court. Hamzah's body was found in September 2011 after police community support officer Jodie Worsley went to the house on a number of occasions due to concerns raised by neighbours. The court heard how there was terrible smell coming from the terraced house and, when Hutton eventually opened the door, there were flies buzzing around her. Police went into the property and 'what they discovered disturbed even hardened officers,' Mr Greaney said. Accused: Hutton, pictured at an earlier hearing, denies killing her son by starving him to death . The prosecutor said Hutton was an abuser of alcohol and cannabis and had been subjected to violence by Hamzah's father, Aftab Khan, who lived away from the home. In police interviews Hutton said her son had become particularly unwell on December 14, 2009 and died the next day. She told police that things deteriorated after her son's death and she began to drink a bottle of vodka a day. Her house contained a huge amount of rubbish, rotting matter, faeces and empty bottles and smell 'almost beyond description,' the jury have heard. The prosecution say Hutton was guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence on two grounds - that she failed to feed him adequately and failed to seek medical assistance for him. Jurors will hear further medical evidence tomorrow before Hutton takes to the witness box in her own defence on Monday.

An ultra running grandmother is proving age is no barrier to sporting achievement as she prepares to take on her toughest challenge yet. This weekend, Mimi Anderson, 51, from Kent, will take part in the Spartathlon - a 153 mile race in Greece from Sparta to Athens. The undulating and at times off-road route follows in the the footsteps of Pheidippides, an ancient Athenian long distance runner, who was said to make the same journey to deliver a message during the battle of Marathon in 490BC. Doing the double: Mimi intends to run from Sparta to Athens and back again, a total of 306 miles . The story of the Greek's feat of endurance inspired the foundation of the modern marathon - but that's a snip in comparison at 26.2 miles (the distance from Marathon to Athens). But even running 153 miles non-stop isn't enough of a challenge for Mimi, who is a grandmother to Theo, aged five, and Finley, two. So she's not only going to run from Sparta to Athens, once she gets there she will turn around and run back again, bringing her total running journey to 306 miles. Accomplishment: The grandmother has previously ran the Badwater ultra marathon in Death Valley twice in a row . The challenge is also heightened by the fact the run out must be completed in under 36 hours and people who don't reach the check points in time will not be permitted to continue. Mimi told the MailOnline how she hopes to become the first woman to complete the double  Spartathlon. She said: 'There is something very special about this race. The Spartathlon is a really tough event not only because of the distance of 153 miles in under 36 hrs but because of all the cut-offs along the route which can get competitors into panic (including me). 'As long as my body holds up and it still puts a smile on . my face, my trainers will stay firmly attached to my feet' 'Only one person as far as I was aware had done it both ways and certainly no female had achieved it. It was suggested that I should give it a go - I love a challenge! 'I am under no illusions that this is going to be nothing other than an extremely tough challenge but I will give it everything I've got and fingers crossed my legs will carry me back to Athens.' This isn't the first time Mimi will have completed a dual ultra event. In 2011 she ran the Badwater ultra route twice - a total distance of 292 miles in scorching conditions - the first woman ever to do so. She has won numerous world records for her endurance feats including the fastest crossing on foot across Ireland (345 miles in three days, 15 hours and nearly 37 minutes) and the furthest distance covered on a treadmill by a female over seven days. Many ultra runners will attest that completing such long distances isn't just about your athletic ability but also about being disciplined about eating and drinking enough to fuel your performance. So Mimi had to overcome another obstacle to make her running dreams possible - beat anorexia. Keep on running: Mimi said she'll carry on as long as she's enjoying it as she strives to see what she can achieve . Remember you . are never too old to take up running, give it a go . She suffered from the eating disorder in her youth for 15 years and said it was taking up running at the age of 36 that gave her the incentive to battle the condition. She explains: 'Running means I have to eat, otherwise my body simply wouldn't have . enough energy. So I'm no longer afraid of food, it's not the enemy but an . essential part of life. Running quite literally has given me back my . life which otherwise may have turned out so differently.' Mimi said she does suffer from the odd niggle which means she might have to back off from training occasionally but she avoids major problems by having regular sports massages and treatments with an osteopath. Despite having already achieved so much, Mimi said her drive to continue comes from her love of competing. She said: 'I enjoy the buzz and atmosphere of racing, competing against other people and seeing if I'm capable of achieving what I set out to do in a particular event. 'I always have a goal whether it's a time or going for a podium place, or a world record. I'm always striving to find the limits of my endurance.' She added that she'll continue running ultras for as long as she can. She said: 'I'll keep going as long as I am enjoying them. I won't be able to compete at the . level I'm at currently for very much longer, simply because the women . coming into the sport now are just fantastic and a good 20 years younger . than me. 'But as long as my body holds up and it still puts a smile on . my face, my trainers will stay firmly attached to my feet!' Mimi is running the double Spartathlon to raise money for the 10 Million Metres Campaign, which was set up by Alex Flynn when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease four years ago.

The management of Havard School 'contend that its acts do not constitute trademark infringement' and have issued a counter-claim, the lawyer added.

A seven-year-old boy died in a fire in a slum house after the wealthy landlord who owned the property left the batteries out of the smoke alarm. Ajit Singh, 50, has been jailed for taking a series of health and safety shortcuts across the 14 properties he owned in Kettering, Northamptonshire, which left them 'like a death-trap'. There was only one smoke detector in the terraced house where young Mateusz Wlodarczyk lived, a court heard, and its battery had been disconnected, meaning it failed to go off when a fire broke out due to an electrical fault. Death-trap: Landlord Ajit Singh, pictured left, had not ensured there were adequate smoke alarms of fire exits in the house where seven-year-old Mateusz Wlodarczyk, right, died in a blaze . There were also no fire doors in the . premises and the front door could only be opened from the inside with a . key - preventing the occupants from escaping quickly. Firefighters battled to rescue the boy after the blaze took hold of the property in Edinburgh Road on May 22 last year. But he suffocated after inhaling thick plumes of smoke. An inquest heard that if the fire alarm had been fitted then the youngster would have probably survived. Earlier this year Singh - who himself lives in a swanky £350,000 detached house in Kettering - pleaded guilty to failing to take general fire precautions at nine properties he owned in run-down areas of the town. He was jailed yesterday for nine months by Judge Rupert Mayo and also ordered to pay £7,500 in costs. Slum: Investigators inspect the scene of the house fire in Edinburgh Road, Kettering, one of 14 properties owned by Ajit Singh - eight of which were deemed unsafe . Prosecutor Cameron Crowe told the court: 'Legislation means that the person responsible for a property is required legally to maintain a standard of fire safety to properly secure the safety of the occupants. 'The fire precautions fell woefully short at Edinburgh Road and the fire subsequently claimed the life of a seven-year-old boy. 'The lengths taken to prevent fire at other properties owned by Singh was grossly inadequate.' Northampton Crown Court heard that most of the houses for which Singh faced charges were lived in by several people - known as houses of multiple occupancy - which greatly increased the risk of fire. Two other men, who acted as property managers for Singh, escaped jail after being sentenced for the same charges relating to different properties. Managers: Huseyin Ozzengin (left) and Waldemar Ordynowski (right) will serve suspended sentences and undertake unpaid work . Husseyin Ozzengin, 45, from Kettering, was handed a four-month sentence, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work. And Waldemar Ordynowski, 41, from Kettering, was sentenced to three months, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to do 175 hours of unpaid work. The pair were also ordered to pay £2,000 in court costs. Speaking outside court, Martyn Emberson, chief fire officer of Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'This case clearly demonstrates how seriously fire safety breaches are viewed by the courts. 'I hope it sends a clear message to landlords and managing agents across the county.' He added that fire services actively investigate houses of multiple occupancy as they are the highest risk premises, often housing vulnerable people who might be exploited by landlords. The failure to take general fire precaution charges relates to breaches of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order. Under the order the person responsible for a property must ensure adequate fire alarms and protectors are in place in a property, adequate emergency escape routes and exits are in place, and adequate 'fire compartmenation' is in place, to prevent the spread of fire and smoke.","Ajit Singh owned 14 properties accross Kettering, Northamptonshire .

When Sharron Kahn Luttrell first signed up to do her bit for the community by helping to train service dogs, she had little idea what an effect it would have on her life and how it would challenge her preconceptions. Training Neads puppy Daisy was literally no walk in the park. Instead every weekend, the Massachusetts mother-of-two found herself in the company of her co-trainer Keith - an inmate sent to prison for 40 years when he was 16 - just a few months older than Luttrell's own daughter. To her - and his - surprise they developed a deep and lasting friendship as they bonded over Daisy. Swapping notes and tips in the prison waiting room, Luttrell soon realized this adorable Labrador had the power to change all of their lives. Her experiences make up the heart-warming memoir Weekends With Daisy, which is currently being developed into a film by CBS Films. In training: Sharron and son Josh introduce Daisy to the sights and sounds of a busy street . Life changing: Sharron Luttrell helped a prisoner named Keith train service dog Daisy . ‘Keith had never taken care of anything. He says he was a selfish kid but you can’t be that way with a puppy,' Luttrell, who has helped train three dogs with him, told MailOnline. 'You have to control your reactions and emotions. When he goes out into . society he will take those qualities with him.' It wasn't just Keith who was helped by Daisy. The cute puppy, the color of butterscotch, also taught Luttrell important lessons about patience, perseverance and the ability to judge a person based on their current actions rather than their past. It was a chance encounter with a service dog at a grocery store that first let to the unlikely alliance between Luttrell and Keith. There she had met another Neads trainer who told her about the program and it seemed the perfect solution to her growing 'empty nest' anxiety. When she first heard of the National Education for Assistance Dog Services program Luttrell had been at a . crossroads in her life, with her two children fast growing up and . needing her less leaving her feeling 'isolated and lost'. The . Neads program, which uses inmates to intensively train service dogs, . gave Luttrell the new focus she was looking for. Dedication: Keith worked hard teaching Daisy commands and tricks, such as 'say your prayers' Work out: Inmates train with their puppies in the prison yard . When she first met Keith at a medium security facility in Rhode Island, Luttrell thought her only challenge would be solving those early puppy problems common to anyone with a young dog. Luttrell found herself turning to Keith for advice, but she had no idea what he had done to be behind bars. At first the obvious elephant in the room was not addressed and the Neads program limits interaction between inmates and weekend puppy raisers. But curiosity got the better of Luttrell - she was a former reporter, after all. More... Mother claims South Carolina school TURNED AWAY her autistic 4-year-old daughter, service dog . Hay there! Hilarious moment grinning horse photo-bombs picture (and other pets get in on the craze too proving no picture is safe) She learned his last name and gasped when she read court documents laying out in clinical detail the shocking nature of his brutal crime. A crime described by the judge as an ‘exhibition of human savagery at its worst’. Keith had been sentenced to a 40-year sentence for accessory to murder when he was 16, after beating a man, who was then shot dead by his friend. ‘Keith was no longer a generic, gentle inmate who trained puppies … he was someone capable of taking another’s life without a thought,’ she said. However, their shared goal of helping Daisy and the person who would one day rely on the dog helped Luttrell overcome her feelings of terror and disgust at Keith's crime. 'For Daisy's sake, for Keith's, for . mine, and for the person out there who would eventually rely on Daisy, I . had to drop the ugliness of Keith's past', she said. She added: ‘[Keith’s] grown tremendously. There’s no good outlet to grow in prison. The puppy program is . something meaningful in that place. It gave him confidence.’ Part of the family: Daisy with Luttrell's children Aviva and Joshua . Here to help: Daisy, at the front, with other Neads service dogs . The puppy program helps inmates as much as the disabled people who eventually become paired up with the dogs. Luttrell said that another inmate she trains with told her that before joining the program everyone told him he was ‘a piece of s***’ and he felt that way too ‘but now he has a different definition’. Despite her bond with Keith, Luttrell says finding out the background to her inmate co-trainers still remains difficult. Her emotions were tested again when, by chance, she discovered the new inmate she was working with had been Keith’s co-defendant – the man who had pulled the trigger on that fateful night. ‘My blood went cold,’ she said, as she recalled how a prison guard had read out his full name, which identified him. Socialized: The job of the weekend puppy raisers is to expose the dogs to new experiences, such as train rides . Helping hand: Daisy picks up a discarded mitten - a trick she was taught by Keith and Sharron . Knowing the co-trainers have committed horrendous crimes is something the mother struggles with. She said the only way she copes with it is by focusing on how Keith and his co-defendant had been teenagers at the time. Neads - the National Education for Assistance Dog Services - is a training progam that teaches puppies to become service dogs. Neads uses a variety of breeds, from Labradors and poodles to collies and labradoodles. The dogs are trained by inmates, who then hand their puppies to volunteer trainers at weekends so they can get used to the noises, sights and sounds of the outside world. Training begins when the puppies are eight weeks old, and takes about 18 months to complete. It costs $25,000 to fully train and pair one of the service dogs with the individual they are matched to. The training is vigorous but Neads has a long waiting list of people willing to adopt the dogs that don't graduate. ‘They’re so foolish [at that age]’ she said. ‘So impulsive, not operating at full capacity. But that said, you just don’t go around killing people.’ Captain Lefebvre, who helps oversee the prison program, has also witnessed the change in inmates involved in the training. He told Luttrell the ‘best trainers are those who consider their work a chance to redeem themselves’. ‘They know they can’t make up for the damage they did … but they can chip away at it.’ For Luttrell, who has now helped train seven puppies, the Neads progam opened the door to a new experience and, as an added bonus, her family gets to have a puppy on weekends. ‘We’re not looking for a dog,’ Luttrell said. ‘I don’t want to go through the end-of-life part again. It’s still too raw [after losing Tucker]’ She said three of the seven dogs she has worked with have 'flunked' the program but her current charge – Rescue – is with her for only one more weekend before graduating. Despite being in the program since 2008 the goodbyes never get easier.  ‘That final weekend I spend lots of time on the floor, snuggling,’ she said. Best friends: Daisy with David, the young boy she was placed with after graduating as a service dog . Luttrell always makes a photo album of her time with the dog to pass on to its new owner, who could be disabled, or need a balance dog, and also shares pictures with the inmate who helped co-train the dog. Daisy not only helped Luttrell focus and learn how to diffuse tensions with her teenage children, the adorable yellow Labrador also helped her see how dogs can transform the lives of the inmates who train them and the people they go on to serve. For Luttrell, she has found fulfillment and a new community and, while she admits she still feels frivolous walking into prison each weekend to pick up a puppy, the Neads program gives her a purpose and a way to reach out and help others.

The mother of a tragic 13-year-old who took her own life four years ago following vicious cyber-bullying has spoken out today to warn students about the perils of social media. Donna Faye Witsell's daughter Hope committed suicide after a topless picture she sent her boyfriend was stolen by another girl student and quickly sent around another dozen schools in Ruskin, Florida. Addressing students of John Hopkins Middle School in St. Petersburg about the issue of cyber-bullying, Witsell cautioned that 'There's no facial expressions that go through the Internet. It doesn't go through your phone.' Scroll Down for Video . Tragic: Hope Witsell took her own life in September 2009 after being bullied over the Internet by fellow students at her school in Rankin, Florida . Mission: Donna Faye Witsell spoke to students at John Hopkins Middle School in St. Petersburg of the need to respect social media and not to bully each other using the Internet . Heartbroken by her loss, Witsell said that Hope should be in her senior year of high school preparing for homecoming, football and the prom. Instead, Witsell is touring schools educating students Hope's age about the perils of instant decisions using social media apps such as Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Singled out because a 'sext' she sent her-then boyfriend was callously sent around without thought of recourse to her feelings, Witsell told those gathered how her daughters life was made a misery. 'She was ridiculed. She was called names. She was spat on. She was shoved into lockers,' said Witsell according to WTSP.Com. Shame: Hope Witsell was pursued on the Internet and physically abused by her bullies at Shields Middle School in Ruskin, Florida . Hurt: The Witsell family were obviously devastated by the death of their Hope and want to see it never happen again . That was in the spring term of 2009 and before Hope could do anything the photograph had gone viral. According to a CNN investigation in the aftermath of Hope's suicide, they discovered that Shields Middle School in Ruskin, Florida, did alert Witsell and her husband. 'The assistant principal had a meeting with my husband and I and pretty much told us that he did not see the image but that he had heard that it was Hope and when he confronted Hope, Hope did not deny it. She wasn't proud of it but she didn't lie,' Hope's mother said to CNN. However, what Hope did not tell her parents was that the picture sparked remorseless bullying online and actual physical brutality by fellow students aged 12 and 13-years-old. They called her a 'slut' and a 'whore' and a 'skank' said her friend Kyla Stich. One other friend, Lexi Leber, said, 'We had to make like a wall, we had people surrounding her, and she had to be in the middle because people would come by and try to hit her and push her into a locker or something. 'She was afraid to walk alone, she was afraid someone would do something to her, like verbally attack her, so she would always have someone with her,' Leber added. Mother and Daughter: Donna Faye Witsell with Hope - Donna is working with schools in the Florida area to make sure that cyber-bullying is understood by parents and students alike . Hurt: Donna Witsell says another student grabbed the boyfriend's phone and sent the image to students at more than a dozen different schools . On the Internet the bullying was centered around a MySpace page called 'Shield Middle School Burn Book' which had a 'Hope Hater Page'. Summer vacation gave the teen a respite, but when school recommenced the bullying simply started back up where it had been left. Then, on Saturday, September 12th, 2009, Hope lent a hand to her father to mow the lawn, then ate a seafood dinner with the rest of her family and went upstairs to watch television. Donna Witsell recalls the harrowing moment she went to say goodnight to her daughter. 'I went upstairs to go in her room and kiss her goodnight. That was when I found her. I screamed for my husband. And started doing CPR,' said Witsell. It was to no avail - Hope had used her favorite scarves to hang herself with from her canopy bed. After her daughter's death, her older sister, Samantha Beattie was shocked to find that the bullying was still going on. 'I knew she had MySpace and Facebook. There were people putting comments on there: 'Did Hope really kill herself?' 'I can't believe that whore did that.' Just obscene things that I would never expect from a 12-year-old or a 13-year-old,' said Samantha. Witsell wants students to know it doesn't have to happen to anyone else. 'They have that power. They have that control. They have it whether they hit delete. They have the power to stop hate,' she said.","Hope Witsell took her own life in 2009 after horrific online bullying after a 'sext' she sent to her boyfriend was maliciously posted to social media .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 00:27 EST, 25 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:12 EST, 25 September 2013 . Brad Reinke of Muncie, Ind opened a letter last month from an insurance underwriting specialist and learned he had seven months to find a new home for his family's pit bulls or lose his home insurance. 'Due to a potential liability hazard, the aggressive dog should be removed from the premises,' the letter from Shelter Insurance Companies read. 'No aggressive dog or aggressive breed of dog should replace this dog.' Such ultimatums are not uncommon for home owners who have what insurance companies deem 'dangerous dog' breeds. Brad Reinke sits with his dogs Lexi and Tito at his home in Muncie, Ind just seven months before he may have to give them away . Dog bites accounted for more than one-third of all homeowners insurance liability claims paid out in 2012, costing more than $489 million, according to the Insurance Information Institute (III). There were 16,459 dog bite claims last year. The average cost of settling those claims was $29,752. Reinke believes his insurance agency jumped to conclusions about his pit bull, however, based on what an underwriter saw through a window and what she heard: barking. 'We've been here for five of the seven years that we've had this company insure our house,'Reinke, a highway technician at the Indiana Department of Transportation, told The Star Press. 'I don't see how they can say they're aggressive when they've never met the dogs. This is pretty much discriminating against the breed, pretty much stereotyping the breed through the window.' Insurance agency officials don't disagree there is a bias, but say that's based on past experience. When Reinke's mother, Jana, a co-signer on her son's mortgage, visited Shelter Insurance agent Joshua Aber in Muncie, she accused him of being discriminatory toward pit bulls. 'Yes, I am,' she quoted him as saying. 'That's exactly what he said.' Owner Brad Reinke has seven months to choose between his dog Lexi or his insurance policy . Aber told The Star Press that excluding aggressive breeds of dogs from homeowners' coverage is common in the insurance industry, and has been for decades. 'If anyone in town knows you have a pit bull, no one is going to insure it unless you have a separate liability policy that you can buy for those breeds,' Aber said. 'I don't sell it.' However, before he could help the Reinkes find a broker who would sell them a stand-alone liability insurance policy for the dogs, 'she threw the letter at me and called us dog racists,' Aber told The Star Press. 'I couldn't help her because she didn't want to be helped. We're here to help people. That letter was meant for them to get coverage for those dogs somewhere else so they don't have a gap in their policy.' Pit bulls are not a common dog for homeowners, according to Aber. 'I have a thousand homeowner policies, he said. 'If 1 percent have pit bulls, that's probably pretty accurate. People who live in tenant property, non-owner occupants, have pit bulls. A lot of times, they end up at the pound and get adopted by people who are more responsible. It is what it is. Some people are fans of the dog and seek it out.' Owner Brad Reinke has seven months to choose between his dog Tito or his insurance policy . Aber said he has no reason to doubt the Reinkes are responsible dog owners. 'There are people who love this breed and think it can be saved and rehabilitated,'he said. 'I'm not here to say it can't, but I offer a product that has rules with it.' Some insurance companies don't want to insure pit bulls or other dogs they consider high risk, said Insurance Information Institute Vice President Loretta Worters. 'It really depends on the company how they handle what are considered aggressive dogs,'she told The Star Press. 'Some companies who have had large losses from certain breeds will not insure them. Some companies will have what's called a 'one bite rule.' If your dog bites someone, the company will pay for the occurrence, but then either will cancel the insurance or may exclude the dog from the policy, so if the dog bites someone again, the homeowner will be liable.' Other insurers look at each dog individually and do not judge based on breed, Worters added. 'They are aware that even normally docile dogs may bite when they are frightened or when defending their puppies, owners or food,' she said. 'The most dangerous dogs are those that fall victim to human shortcomings such as poor training, irresponsible ownership and breeding activities that foster viciousness.' Brad Reinke sits with his dog Lexi at his home in Muncie, Ind just seven months before his insurance policy may be cancelled . Neither of Reinke's dogs has ever bitten anyone. 'They're not even remotely close to being aggressive,' Reinke said of Lexi, a white female rescue dog whom he sent to obedience school as a condition of adopting her, and Tito, a black male with a white streak on his face and a white chest. When The Star Press visited Reinke's home, both dogs barked, sniffed and wanted attention for a minute or two before calming down and posing for photographs. Lexi seemed lazy, and sat on Reinke's lap. When he let the dogs out in the front yard unrestrained, they didn't leave the property. Tito played fetch with a tennis ball. Some insurance companies would take that into consideration when deciding coverage, but they don't have to, which was the case with the Reinke's insurance provider. Brad Reinke sits with his dogs Lexi and Tito at his home in Muncie, Ind seven months before he has to choose between his dogs or his insurance policy . State Farm Insurance, which insures one out of every four homes in Indiana, asks each potential customer whether or not their dog has bitten anyone, said spokeswoman Missy Dundov. 'Based on that answer and possible follow-up answers, we then determine if they qualify for homeowners insurance,' she said. 'We do not require a stand-alone liability policy. Either they qualify for our homeowners policy or do not.' State Farm alone had 3,670 dog bite claims nationally last year and paid more than $108 million as a result. Among the top 10 states for dog bite claims in 2012 for State Farm was Indiana, coming in at seventh, one spot ahead of Florida. Man and woman's best friend bites more than 4.7 million a year, according to the American Veterinary Association, the U.S., Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each year, 800,000 Americans seek medical attention for those bites. Shelter Insurance has given the Reinkes until April to remove the dogs, which the couple have no intention of doing. Brad Reinke said he planned to start shopping around for a new policy after the first of the year.","Such ultimatums are not uncommon for home owners who have what insurance companies deem 'dangerous dog' breeds.

A parents' group in Russia says Elton John's concert should be banned because it contravenes 'gay propaganda' laws . A Russian parents' committee has asked President Vladimir Putin to cancel a planned concert by gay musician Elton John, saying he intended to violate a ban on 'homosexual propaganda'. In an open letter to Putin, the local parents' group in central Ural region was reported by media as saying: 'The singer intends to come out in support of local sodomites and break the current Russian law, directed at protecting children.' Critics say the law banning gay 'propaganda' among minors - which has prompted calls for a boycott of Russia's hosting of the 2014 Winter Olympics - is discriminatory, barring people from being open about their sexual orientation. The law is part of a broader attempt by Putin to win over Russians in the mostly conservative country following protests against his rule among urban and often middle class voters over his return to the Kremlin last May. The parents' committee was unavailable for comment today, Reuters reported, and a spokesman for the singer said he wished to make no comment. Sir Elton John, who reminisced in an interview earlier this month about having sex on a Moscow rooftop with a translator during his 1979 Soviet Union tour, said he wanted to perform in Russia to support the gay community. 'As a gay man, I can't leave those people on their own without going over there and supporting them. I don't know what's going to happen, but I've got to go,' he said in the interview. Elton will perform on December 6 in Moscow and December 7 in Kazan. One of the world's most prominent gay celebrities, he lives with his partner David Furnish, with whom he is in a civil union, and they are bringing up two children together. He has campaigned for gay rights in Britain and in Ukraine where he was denied the right in 2009 to adopt a child because of his age and marital status. Hard line on homosexuals: Russia's president Vladimir Putin is hoping to win over conservative voters . This summer, anti-gay campaigners warned Elton not to wear 'flamboyant' clothes at his planned concert in Krasnodar in July.  The concert was later cancelled when the singer fell ill. 'Promoting homosexuality' is an offence in several Russian regions, including Krasnodar, St Petersburg, and Novosibirsk. Last year Madonna was sued by Russian anti-gay groups for £7m for violating the local laws after they claimed her concert in St Petersburg, in which she spoke in favour of gay rights, 'promoted homosexuality'.  The lawsuit was later thrown out of court. Elton John and David Furnish are raising two sons - adoptions by same-sex foreigners is banned in Russia . Lady Gaga criticised the law in concerts in St Petersburg last year, leading Moscow to implement a harsher visa regimes for performers coming to Russia. U.S. singer Cher turned down an invitation to perform at the Winter Games in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi because of the anti-gay propaganda, saying the decision was a 'no brainer'. Russia's anti-gay stance has hardened considerably in recent years.  Earlier this year Putin announced a ban on adoptions by foreign same-sex couples, claiming that the children could be 'psychologically damaged'. The decision followed the commissioning of a report into so called 'psychological damage' suffered by a boy was who was adopted by two gay women in the US.","The gay singer is due to perform gigs in Moscow and Kazan in December .

A male pop fan who idolised Britney Spears has undergone a sex change operation to make himself look more like the star. Transsexual Kara Hays has now spent over £60,000 on gender re-alignment surgery and breast implants. The 26-year-old, who was born a man and used to be known as Kody, now has long-flowing blonde hair in imitation of the 90s pop singer. Kara has now spent £60,000 to look more like 90s pop legend Britney Spears . Transsexual Kara Hays, 26, was named Kody before undergoing a sex change and procedures to look like her idol . Ms. Hays said after deciding to have a sex change choosing which woman he wanted to look like was a natural choice. 'When you feel like you’re a girl living in a boy’s body and you try to change you want that validation that you look like a girl. I viewed her as a very strong woman, everybody wanted to date her.

'I focused on Britney and Christina Aguilera for my inspiration: they were the stars that were around when I was younger, they are who you looked up to. 'Nowadays people have Lady Gaga and Katy Perry. 'I was just thinking, I want to be a girl now, who do I emulate?' And it is not merely just in looks that the 26-year-old takes after her idol, as she even claims to have had a mental breakdown around the same time as Britney - shaving off her head to join her beloved heroine.

Kara said: 'I was in a really bad mood one day and just went into the salon and told them to take my extensions out. 'I thought if Britney has the strength to do it then I do too. 'People told me it was such a bold statement, I felt so liberated. 'I’ve never felt good enough and I tried to do anything to make myself ugly, this was one of those things.' The 26-year-old has forked out a fortune on achieving what she calls the perfect look . Kara, pictured left with her father, and in a High School photograph, right, always dreamed of looking more like Britney . The 26-year-old says her new appearance, which has turned her into a lookalike of the pop singer who shot to fame with her debut album '...Baby One More Time' in 1999, has finally brought her happiness following years of anguish. After shocking classmates by turning up at a Halloween dance, aged just 12, dressed in a red vinyl body suit in homage to Britney's costume in her 'Oops I did it again' video - he caused uproar in the Bible-belt town in Ohio, US, where he grew up. But at the age of 15, his parents allowed him to see a doctor and he was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 1999 and began taking female hormones.

The aspiring actress said: 'Once I changed, I went through school perfectly normally, I had to adhere to the rules and dress code like everyone else. 'I felt like I was put under a microscope though. I felt like I couldn’t have any form of scandalous situation because I was already a scandal in itself. 'It was almost like I went through puberty twice.' Kara began experimenting with drink and drugs once she had graduated high school, and moved to Los Angeles in an attempt to pursue a career in acting. She began being mistaken as Britney and was even referred to as the mega star by members of the paparazzi, something she claims was 'incredibly validating'. Kara later moved to New York to attend the New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts for a year, graduating last year before starting on a degree in public relations.","Kara Hays, 26, from Ohio, has spent a fortune attempting to emulate the 90s pop singer .

Emily Craig, 20 and Shaun Bowden, 31, were arrested in various states of undress by police after concerned members of the public phoned 911 at 8.40 a.m. to the North Charleston store on August 28th. A police spokesman said that officers were dispatched 'in reference to a male and female entering a display shed on the property, closing the door behind themselves and remaining inside.' Busted: Emily Craig, 20, and Shaun Bowden, 31, were nabbed after cops were called to the store in North Charleston at the end of August at 8:40AM . When police arrived to the outdoor display shed they noted that Craig was 'partially clothed: the top of her dress was untied, hanging at her waist.' Bowden had no shirt on and 'had his pants down near his knees'. He was found to have his penis exposed. During a court hearing last Thursday, Craig pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and providing a false name to police. She was sentenced to time served, the 22 days she spent in custody following her arrest. Bowden, who did not show up in court, was tried in absentia and found guilty of disorderly conduct and indecent exposure. Bowden was also sentenced a concurrent 30-day jail sentence. The judge revoked his $400 bond and issued a bench warrant for his immediate arrest. Shed: Bowden had no shirt on and 'had his pants down near his knees'. He was found to have his penis exposed . The excitable couple were arrested for disorderly conduct and Bowden was also given an indecent exposure count for, 'having his genitals within public view.'

The Republican Study Committee (RSC), an informal caucus that provides research and writes legislation for conservative partisans, plans to offer a 200-page bill that would repeal President Obama's 900-page health care overhaul and its 20,000 pages of related federal regulations. But right-wingers will undoubtedly hit a . roadblock with Democrats when they learn that the bill would ban the . use of federal tax dollars for funding abortions. Sponsored by Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, The American Health Care Reform Act would repeal the Obamacare law and offer taxpayers direct subsidies so they can choose their own insurance plans on the open market. The tax deductions, valued at $7,500 for individuals and $20,000 for families, would be portable from job to job. Americans would be permitted to pocket whatever portion of the subsidies they don't spend, and insurance plan purchases would be permitted across state lines on a nationwide basis for the first time. More attractively for conservative Republicans, the proposal would cut federal bureaucrats out of the health care-buying process, giving Americans full authority to decide what kind of insurance suits them. 'This is about giving Americans all the choices and none of the grief,' a Republican House staffer to an RSC member told MailOnline. 'Basically, we've had it up to here with voters telling us to kill Obamacare before it kills them.' A billboard in New York City promotes a plan to defund Obamacare. The conservative Heritage Foudnation sponsored the ad . Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise (L) and Tennessee Rep. Phil Roe (R) lead the Republican Study Committee and promoted their bill Wednesday on Capitol HIll . 'We think people are smart enough and will find the best plan for their family,' Scalise told The Daily Caller, which first reported the details of the RSC's plan. Scalise stressed Republicans' belief that Americans should have a wider berth when choosing their health insurance, and said the RSC's bill would provide options 'if sex change operations are not something you want ... if you want a bare-bones policy, [or] if you want a Cadillac plan.' 'By allowing people to buy health insurance across state lines and pool together so small businesses and families can get the same buying power as large corporations,' he said Wednesday in a press release, 'we can lower costs and increase choices while removing Washington bureaucrats from your health care decisions.' According to a bill summary provided to MailOnline, the proposal would provide for a 10-year $25 'high risk pool' fund, intended to offset the health care costs of Americans suffering from pre-existing conditions that could otherwise make them ineligible for some private insurance plans. The law would also prohibit the spending of federal health care dollars to provide abortion services. The Obama administration has made hay in recent months over Republicans' reluctance to offer an alternative to the Obamacare law while simultaneously complaining that it represents a government takeover of one-seventh of America's private-sector economy. While House GOP leaders have held more than 40 separate votes to repeal the law, they nave failed to rally around a single replacement proposal. President Obama has taken public victory laps this year on his health care law, but his hand-picked press conference companions don't reflect the country's mood, polls show . The cheerleader: Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius addressed health care providers on Monday in Florida, as part of a tour to quell concerns before the Obamacare law's October 1 enrollment deadline . 'They offer no hope of a better situation when it comes to healthcare for all those millions of Americans,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said on Monday. 'They say, ""Sorry, we’re going to take away those refunds, we’re going to take away the benefits that you’ve already enjoyed,"" all in the name of an ideological agenda. The president engaged Republicans directly on Monday, saying that he is 'more than willing to work with them where they've got specific suggestions that they can show will make our health care system work better.' But he, too, insisted that the GOP had not proferred a workable alternative. 'Remember,' he said, 'initially this . was like ""repeal and replace,"" and the replace thing has kind of gone . off to the wayside. Now it's just ""repeal.""' The . White House has not commented Wednesday on the RSC's reported proposal. But the liberal Slate website called it an impractical 'health care . unicorn.' Tea party-affiliated conservatives rallied in Washington on Sept. 10, demanding the kind of Obamacare exemptions for all taxpayers that members of Congress and their staffers have already won from the White House . President Obama has also complained this week about reports that the GOP plans to use the Obamacare law as a bargaining chip in an upcoming federal budget fight. President Barack Obama is sticking to his guns as the October 1 Obamacare deadline approaches for individual taxpayers . During a Wednesday speech to the Business Roundtable, he blamed GOP partisanship for holding the federal budget, and a planned increase in the federal debt ceiling, hostage to a health care law repeal. 'This town, Washington, is locked up,' Obama said, blaming a 'small faction' of Republicans intent on derailing 'progress' on various issues. Congressional Republicans, he claimed, are 'extort[ing]' the White House with threats of a debt default. 'What we now have,' said Obama, 'is a ideological fight that's been mounted in the House of Representatives that says, we're not going to pass a budget and we will threaten a government shutdown unless we repeal the Affordable Care Act.' 'We have not seen this in the past, that a budget is contingent on us eliminating a program that was voted on, passed by both chambers of Congress, ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court, is two weeks from being fully implemented, and that helps 30 million people finally get health care coverage.' Sen. Chuck Schumer, an outspoken New York Democrat, predicted an electoral disaster last week for Republicans who go to the mat for an Obamacare repeal. 'What’s going on here – and I’ve never seen anything quite like this – is, this small few who represent maybe five percent of the electorate dictate what’s going on, hold the country by the neck and paralyze things,' Schumer said. 'The good news is, we do have elections. And if they succeed in their platform, they will fail the way Mitt Romney failed.' Seventy-four GOP representatives – far more than five percent but not enough to form a House majority – have signed on to a plan that ties a budget 'continuing resolution' to the repeal or defunding of the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature legislative achievement, even at the risk of shutting down the government in a stalemate. Republican moderates have resisted, citing fears that Americans would hold the Republican Party responsible for any government shutdown. A consensus is slowly building among House moderates, however, for a plan that would call for a one-year moratorium on Obamacare enforcement. Anti-Obamacare protesters may have the pulse of America after all, judging from the latest polling data to emerge about the Affordable Care Act . 'I think you’re seeing more of us in the House gravitating toward a one-year delay,' Scalise told The Daily Caller, 'as the most – right now, the most – likely way to get relief from Obamacare and to keep this fight going.' According to the Republican Study Committee, its American Health Care Reform Act would: . The first hard deadlines attached to the law are just two weeks away, but the White House has already announced a one-year delay before insurance coverage mandates will be enforced against employers. Rep. Phil Roe, a Tennessee Republican who is a medical doctor, told a gaggle of reporters Wednesday morning that delaying implementation for individual taxpayers as well would 'allow people to find out what a pig in the poke they bought.' Roe said another year of breathing room would give taxpayers 'some clarity for the rule-making. It'll also give us the chance to go out and define clearly what they have now with the current law, and what they could have.' He held a copy of the Republican Study Committee's plan in his right hand as he spoke. 'Unfortunately, during the Obamacare debate no one asked me or any of the other Republican doctors what we thought, despite requesting several meetings with the president because I saw this train wreck coming,' he said Wednesday in a statement. 'We know the president’s health care law is unworkable and that is exactly why Chairman Scalise asked me to help draft a replacement bill. Our bill will not increase taxes, does not rely on mandates, expands coverage and lowers costs.' The Affordable Care Act is reaching new lows in popularity among ordinary taxpayers. A Pew Research Center/USA Today poll released this week found that 53 per cent of Americans disapprove of the health care law, a number that matches the highest the poll has measured since the law passed in Congress. And an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that just 12 per cent of Americans believe the implementation of Obamacare will be positive for their families.","Plan would completely replace Obamacare with tax deductions of up to $20,000 .

A young mother gave birth to a baby boy in the front seat of a taxi - then received a £40 valeting bill from the driver two days later. Jenny Larkin, 22, was forced to call for a cab in the early hours of the morning after going into labour in Redcar, North Yorkshire. But as driver Steven Morrell pulled up outside the maternity unit Miss Larkin started giving birth and midwives had no choice but to deliver the baby in the vehicle. Newborn: Mother-of-three Jenny Larkin, 22, was given a £40 valeting bill after giving birth to her son Finlay (centre) in the back of a taxi. She is pictured here with her partner Tim Galloway, 29 . The mother-of-three, who travelled to hospital with partner Tim Galloway, 29, in the back of the car later named her 7lb 15oz  child Finley. Driver Mr Morrell, who works for J&P Taxis, put plastic sheeting down in the front of the vehicle but the seat was damaged anyway. He said that he lost two days' takings while the vehicle was off the road. Miss Larkin said: 'Tim told them it was for . maternity and when he came he had some plastic sheeting on the front . seat and said it was fine for me to sit there. New child: Baby Finlay Larkin weighed a healthy 7lb 15oz when he arrived into the world in the front seat of a taxi outside a hospital in Middlesbrough . 'Mortified': Miss Larkin said she cannot afford the £40 taxi valeting bill. She said: 'We are on benefits and £40 is a lot of money. We had paid £16 already for the fare' 'We . got on the A174 and I said the baby was coming. By the time we were . pulling up at the hospital, the baby was already coming out. 'Five . midwives rushed out to see what the situation was and there my baby boy . was, hanging down and in a bit of shock. I had to deliver him there. That's when he said to my partner ""I want the cleaning bill"".' Miss Larkin was admitted to James Cook University Hospital's maternity unit in Middlesbrough after giving birth in the early hours of last Friday morning. Both mother and baby were discharged later the same day after being checked over. Taxi company: Jenny Larkin used self-employed driver Steven Morrell who works for J&P Taxis . Newborn: Jenny with her newborn son Finlay. She also has two other children Elise, five, and Ruby, two . The following Monday the driver turned up at their home and presented them with a cleaning bill for £40. Jenny, who also has two girls Elise, five, and Ruby, two, said: 'I was absolutely mortified. He knew he was going to maternity before he even set off and had put plastic sheets on the front seat. 'We are on benefits and £40 is a lot of money. We had paid £16 already for the fare. 'Tim said to him, ""how do you expect us to pay that sort of money?"" and he said ""pay us when you've got it"".' The taxi driver, who is responsible for the cleaning and maintenance of his own cab as part of his self-employed contract with J&P Taxis, said such events are 'one of the hazards of the job'. He added: 'Unfortunately someone's got to pay for it. I don't think I'm being nasty asking for the valeting cost back. 'I couldn't work on Friday or Saturday because the interior was still wet so I lost two days' takings.'

"By . Laura Collins In Billings, Montana and James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 23:46 EST, 25 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:02 EST, 26 September 2013 . Rapist: This Sept. 12, 2013 file photo released by the Montana State Prison shows Stacey Rambold, a 54-year-old teacher who is serving a 30-day sentence in prison for raping a former student who later killed herself . Stacey Rambold, 48, the man sentenced to just 30-days behind bars even after admitting raping a 14-year-old girl will walk free from prison today after completing his controversially short sentence. His lenient punishment for the 2007 rape of Cherice Moralez, who killed herself three-years later, was handed down to him by District Judge Todd Baugh and the comments made by Baugh about Moralez sparked national outrage. Rambold is due to walk out of the Montana State Prison in Deer Lodge at 11 a.m. but Moralez's mother Auliea Hanlon spoke on Tuesday of her hopes that the Montana Supreme Court will overturn Judge Baugh's decision and re-sentence the former Billings high school teacher. Indeed, the prosecutors in the case have appealed the sentence, claiming it is illegal and on Tuesday the Montana and Pennsylvania chapters of the National Organization of Womenfiled a complaint with a judicial review board on behalf of more than 140,000 who signed a petition against the sentence. The case attracted international attention when Baugh handed down a one-month sentence to Rambold and said that Moralez, 'seemed older than her chronological age"" and she was ""as much in control of the situation.' Hanlon told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she wants to avoid Rambold. 'I never saw him until we were in a courtroom all those years,' she said. 'I hope I never see him again. Blocked: . Montana Supreme Court voted 4-2 barring Judge Todd Baugh (pictured) from holding a hearing to possibly amend rapist's 30-day sentence' Disgusted: Auliea Hanlon told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she never wants to see Stacey Rombold, the man who raped her daughter and that she is yet to see justice for her daughters sexual assault . Earlier this month, Montana's highest court ruled today that a state judge does not have the authority to amend a controversial 30-day sentence he handed down to Rombold. The lenient jail term and the judge's provocative argumentation sparked widespread outrage among women's groups and victims’ advocates. Amid public outcry and growing pressure from the persecution, who vowed to appeal the sentence, Judge Baugh apologized earlier this month for his earlier remarks and called a hearing to re-examine and possibly amend Rambold's sentence - a move the state attorney general challenged as being outside Baugh's legal authority. On Friday 6th of September, Montana . Supreme Court agreed, ruling 4-2 against Baugh's planned unilateral . action, and paving the way for prosecutors to file an appeal. ‘We . conclude that the stated intent of the District Court (Baugh) to alter . the initially imposed oral sentence in today's scheduled hearing is . unlawful and that the proceeding should be arrested,’ the court ruled, . without commenting on the validity of the sentence itself. Horror: Cherice Moralez, pictured, shot herself dead in her mother's bed after being repeatedly raped by a teacher who will serve just 30 days in jail . The decision came down just hours before the state judge was to convene the hearing to reconsider the sentence. In a bizarre twist, the defense joined the prosecution in opposing the scheduled hearing , saying that it would be 'without legal authority.' The prosecution said the 54-year-old disgraced educator probably should have received a minimum of two years in prison instead of the 15-year-term with all but a month suspended that Baugh had given him. Earlier in September, Judge Baugh caused further outrage by claiming that his paltry sentence ‘actually upped’ the convicted rapist’s ‘debt to society’. In a written addendum to his sentence handed down in Billings District Court Monday the judge stated: ‘Had the defendant pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury three years ago, he would have had a basis from which to argue for a minimum sentence.’ Victim Cherice Moralez committed suicide on February 6, 2010. She shot herself in her mother’s bed just three weeks before her 17th birthday. Teacher: Rambold, 54, lost his house, his job, his teaching license and his wife as a result of the charges. His lawyer suggested, and the judge seemed to agree on Monday, that he had been 'punished enough' According to her mother, Auliea Hanlon, the pending trial of teacher Stacey Rambold - 49 when the rapes were committed - and trauma of the abuse were ‘major factors’ in her daughter’s death. Speaking to MailOnline Mrs Hanlon said that her daughter had been ‘in hell,’ shunned by classmates and bullied following the revelations of the abuse. Her death complicated the prosecution of former Billings Senior High School teacher Rambold, now 54, who was arrested and charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent in 2008. Prosecutors who had sought to put Rambold behind bars instead settled for a three-year deferred prosecution. According to the terms of the agreement the case would be dismissed after this term if Rambold pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent and entered a three-stage sex offender treatment program. But in December 2012 the case was revived when it transpired that Rambold had violated the terms of the program, having contact with minors and engaging in a sexual relationship [not with a minor] without informing his counselor. In his written explanation Judge Baugh maintained that these violations were ‘not significant’. He stated: ‘There were violations of the treatment program, but involved no violence, no inappropriate sexual conduct, and no new criminal activity. ‘Defendant’s old treatment provider recommended that the Defendant still be assessed as a low risk offender and treatable in the community. Critic: Auliea Hanlon, Cherice's . mother criticized the judge's apology as 'meaningless' ‘Knowing that the Defendant had enrolled in another sexual offender treatment program, the Court is faced with deciding if the Defendant should go to prison for relatively minor infractions.’ Judge Baugh went on to state that there was other information that could not be publicly released but had played a part in the court’s decision: a July 2013 pre-sentence report from the Department of Corrections, an August 2009 psychological/psychosocial evaluation of Rambold, and two interviews with the victim in 2009. Judge Baugh was forced to apologize for his comments in court, in which he claimed that the victim was ‘older than her chronological years’ and ‘in control of the situation’ in which she was raped in Rambold’s car, his then marital home and on school premises. Similarly he drew fierce criticism when appearing to diminish the crime as, in defending his sentence, he said: ‘I think people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape ... but it wasn’t this forcible, beat up rape.’ In his addendum he conceded: ‘Rape under any circumstances is a horrible violent offense. Some involved physical beatings, broken bones. Others, as here, involve young victims legally not capable of consenting. All are traumatic and all are crimes.’ Though he stated that he believed a prison sentence to be ‘appropriate’ in this case Judge Baugh   stood by his decision to suspend all but 31 days of Rambold’s 15 years plus one day’s credit for time served. He said: ‘Based on all circumstances, the Court upped Mr Rambold’s debt to society from the almost expired three years Deferred Prosecution Agreement to the 15 years suspended sentence.’ Rambold’s sentence puts him on probation for 15 years and requires him to finish sex-offender treatment and to register as a convicted sex offender. Yellowstone County prosecutor Scott Twito is still reviewing the sentence with a view to finding some legal grounds for appeal, and Judge Baugh’s explanation and defense of his decision will do little to silence the voices of those clamoring for his resignation. 'Bad form': Judge Baugh is running for re-election next year. Protestors vowed to ensure he doesn't receive a fifth term . Tens of thousands have signed an online petition calling for him to be removed from his post and yesterday hundreds protested his sentence outside Billings District Court House. Speaking to MailOnline Cherry’s mother said: ‘Rambold took away everything beautiful in my life and he just gets to walk away. He confessed. He did it. ‘With this sentence the judge just lets everyone off – he lets the school off and he lets him off.’","Montana teacher Stacey Rambold, 48, was sentenced to 30 days in prison for raping a 14-year-old girl last month .

She was the former merchant navy sailor turned sixties icon, cabaret star, baroness and one of the most famous beauties of the age. But April Ashley's pretty face hid a secret. She had been born a boy named George Jamieson and, at the age of 25, became one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Now her incredible story is the subject of a new exhibition, April Ashley: Portrait of a Lady, which opens tomorrow at the Museum of Liverpool. Scroll down for video . Pioneer: 60s model April Ashley, 78, was the first Briton to undergo gender reassignment surgery . Cabaret star: Backstage at Le Carrousel, the Paris club where she worked as a drag queen, in 1958 . 'I'm very excited,' revealed Ashley, now 78. 'I could never have . imagined that when I left Liverpool sixty years ago I would one day . return to an exhibition about my life in the Museum!' 'April has had an astonishing life but . throughout it all she has fought for her rights, and provided advice and . support for those suffering similar discrimination,' added curator Gary Everett. Born in 1935 in Liverpool, the former George Jamieson was one of six children born to a father serving in the navy and an abusive mother. 'She used to hang me upside-down and bang my head on the floor,' Ashley explained, in a candid interview with the Telegraph. 'She also whipped me so badly that there was a hole in my back the doctor could put his thumb into.' Desperate to get away, Ashley joined the merchant navy at 14 but it proved an unhappy experience, compounded by the fact that at the age of 15, she remained sexually underdeveloped. Family: George Jamieson (centre) suffered terribly at the hands of his abusive mother while growing up . Unbearable: April, pictured as a boy (left) and as a pre-op transsexual (right) says surgery changed her life . Discharged after attempting suicide, she was sent to a mental institution in Omskirk before being released and moving to London in 1950. Here, her astonishing transformation began, speeding up after she moved to Paris and became a cabaret drag queen, performing under the name of April E. By the age of 25, April, who says she had felt that she was in the wrong body from the age of three, had concluded that dressing and living as a woman wasn't enough and in 1960, she underwent gender realignment surgery at the hands of pioneering surgeon Dr Georges Burou in the Moroccan city of Casablanca. 'I knew I couldn’t have gone on living like that,' she told the Telegraph of her decision to submit to a type of surgery that was then in its infancy. 'Anything was preferable, really. And, as soon as I woke up, I had the most extraordinary feeling. Even though I’d lost a lot of blood and all my hair had fallen out, it was as though my brain was in tune with the rest of my body for the first time in my life.' Glamorous: April in a photograph taken by David Bailey during her modelling heyday in 1961 . Icon: Bailey (left) is the subject of an exhibition of his own and was played by Aneurin Barnard in a 2012 film . Stunning: April bears a striking resemblance to Liz Taylor in this sultry 1964 photograph . After a lengthy recovery, April returned to the UK where her modelling career took off courtesy of appearances in Vogue and shoots with photographer David Bailey. But her origins - and her operation - remained secret until in 1961, a 'friend' sold her story to the Sunday People. The fall out was devastating and both her modelling and fledgling film careers were crushed by the scandal. After being 'outed' as transsexual, April's life - in particular her romances - regularly made the headlines, including her . controversial divorce from The Honourable Arthur Corbett - later 3rd Baron Rowallan – . in 1970. The judge ruled that April remained a biological man and the . marriage was therefore invalid and annulled - setting a legal precedent that endured until 2004 when the law was finally changed. Since then, she has lived a wonderfully full life, claiming to have had affairs with Omar Sharif, Michael Hutchence and Grayson Perry albeit while struggling to scratch a living as a waitress, hostess and art seller in Paris. Recognition: April is presented with her MBE for services to transgender equality by Prince Charles in 2012 . Two years ago, April moved home to the UK and now lives in a south London flat. She also, in 2012, was awarded an MBE for services to transgender equality. Nevertheless, she has admitted that she still feels a sense of isolation, despite her achievements and the growing public acceptance of transgender people. 'I’m so tired of being told I’m loved,' she said, speaking to the Telegraph, 'and then people don’t even bother ringing me up to see how I am.' With the launch of the new exhibition, perhaps that will finally change. April Ashley: Portrait of a Lady runs until September 2014 at the Museum of Liverpool.

Sorensen’s full title is 1st Lieutenant of the 303rd Explosive Ordnance Disposal Battalion, 8th Military Police Brigade, 8th Theater Sustainment Command. And as bulky as the title sounds, it doesn’t have nearly the heft of the bomb suit, called an EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal). ‘Whenever EOD goes out in the bomb suits for a manual approach, it's really important that we're able to work and sweat in the suit and still be able perform, so making it a competition when we train helps with that. Running a mile like this is definitely a challenge,’ said the 1st Lieutenant, who is her unit’s executive officer. 'It's really important that we're able to work and sweat in the suit and still be able perform, so making it a competition when we train helps with that,' said Sorensen . Shattered: Sorensen ran a mile in the 75-pound suit in 11 minutes, 6 seconds, beating the previous record by over two minutes . Her 18 months of training paid off Monday as throngs of her colleagues piled onto the bleachers at the University of Hawaii-Manoa track to watch her make the attempt. Sorenson briefly warmed up beforehand, wearing bright pink—an unassuming hue for a woman about to haul 75 pounds of bomb-proof gear for a mile in Hawaii heat. The impressive lady quickly removed the EOD suit once her record run was over, but she was eager to convey her excitement after catching her breath. ‘We finally did it, it feels awesome, and I really appreciate everybody coming out for it,’ she said. According to Hawaii News Now, Sorensen compared the run to the grueling last few miles of a marathon. The .

Scientists believe it will be decades before the Gulf of Mexico sea floor, damaged across almost 60-square-miles, recovers from the 2010 BP oil spill, according to a recently published study. The most severe damage from the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster stretches almost two miles in all directions from the toxic spill, with moderate damage stretching 10.6 miles to the southwest and 5.3 miles to the northeast – a total of 57-square-miles. The study was conducted by a team of scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency, BP and multiple scholars. The findings were published last month in PLOS One, a scientific journal. A total disaster: Dispersant clotted oil and fresh crude floating May 6, 2010, on the surface nine miles from the Deepwater Horizon oil well spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Based on 68 sediment samples collected between one-third of a mile and 78 miles from the spill site in two surveys from September to October, 2010, the study is the first to attempt to quantify the extent of damage resulting from the blown-out Macondo well. ‘Recovery rates in the deep sea are likely to be slow, on the order of decades or longer,’ the study said. As part of the research, bottom-dwelling organisms referred to as benthos were sifted from the collected sediment and tested for pollution. The sediment itself was also tested for toxins. Chemicals including barium, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and total petroleum hydrocarbons were found to have permeated the sea floor, the study said. Barium is key component in the slurry often referred to as heavy mud, which is used to drill the well. The other chemical compounds are also known to be in the spilled oil, the study said. Firestarter: A Briggs employee places an igniter package in oil contained by fire boom in the Gulf of Mexico to start a controlled burn . Blown out: Dark clouds of smoke billowed over the Gulf of Mexico while controlled fires were used to burn off oil on the surface . Mapping the concentrations of these chemicals found in the sediment enabled scientists to determine the oil spill’s foot print, as well as outline the severity of damage across the spill zone – while at the same time delineating damage caused by natural seepage. This data, in addition to the known differences in biodiversity found across different locations in the Gulf of Mexico, revealed a startling discovery – the more contaminated areas were far less diverse than non-polluted areas. ‘It is apparent that the Deepwater . Horizon blow out and subsequent oil spill did adversely affect deep-sea . soft-sediment benthos,’ said the study. ‘The tremendous biodiversity of meiofauna in the deep-sea area of the Gulf of Mexico we studied has been reduced dramatically,’ researcher Jeff Baguley, of the University of Nevada-Reno, told the New Orleans Times-Picayune. The floor-dwelling organisms scientists were studying are less than one-hundredth of an inch long. Toxic spill: Ribbons of oil in Gulf waters look like tiger stripes from high above the Gulf of Mexico near the source of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . A wide swath: Almost 60-square-miles of sea floor was damaged by the oil spill, it may take decades to recover . Additional damage is also believed to have impacted marine life not living on the Gulf of Mexico’s floor, likely caused by underwater oil plumes that took time to sink. ‘There were likely mid-water impacts to plankton and a variety of mid-water species,’ the study said. The oil and heavy mud mixture will have to fully degrade in order for the deep sea animals to fully recover. Without exposure to light, oxygen and other elements essential to degradation, the study says, the recovery may take a significant amount of time. ‘Recovery of soft-bottom benthos after previous shallow-water oil spills has been documented to take years to decades,’ the study said. Despite the study being peer-reviewed . and deemed to be accurate, according to the Times-Picayune, BP refuted . the claims made by researchers. Land and sea: Workers remove oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig spill from parts of Gulf Shores beach, Alabama . ‘The . paper provides no data to support a claim that it could take decades . for these deep sea species to recover’ Jason Ryan, press officer for BP . America, said in a statement. ‘In fact, the researchers acknowledge that . little is known about recovery rates of these communities following an . event such as this.’ Mr . Ryan did not dispute the damage caused to the area by the spill, rather . he further blasted the study by saying it was already revealed by a . different team of scientists almost two years ago. The team of scientists said they have further sediment samples from 2011 they are studying, and expect results within the next year. Any further conclusions will be based on those findings. 'We are now in the process of analyzing data collected from a subsequent cruise in the spring of 2011,' NOAA's Cynthia Cooksey told the Times-Picayune. 'Those data will not be available for another year, but will also inform how we look at conditions over time.'","Damage from the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico extends almost 60-square-miles from the blown-out well .

Dyson Allen, 19, who started a housefire while 'out of his head' on drink and drugs that killed three young children and their elder brother as he tried to save them, has been jailed for life . A teenager who started a housefire while 'out of his head' on drink and drugs that killed three young children and their elder brother as he tried to save them, has been jailed for life. Four-year-olds Holly and Ella Smith and their two-year-old brother Jordan were asleep as the blaze took hold in Freckleton, Lancashire, while elder brother Reece, 19, was overcome by fumes as he went upstairs to try to rescue them. All four died from the effects of smoke inhalation from the blaze on January 7 last year. In July, Dyson Allen, 19, was convicted of four counts of manslaughter by a jury at Preston Crown Court, who found he had set fire to a bedroom wardrobe. A birthday party was being held for the children’s mother, Michelle Smith, at the address in Lytham Road. Heavy cannabis user Allen had spent the day drinking vodka and smoking cannabis from a bong. Sentencing him to life, Mr Justice Males said he had no motive to harm the children or anyone in the Smith family. He said: 'So why did you do it? In one sense, what prompted you to do this terrible thing - not only starting a fire in a room where defenceless young children were asleep but waiting for several minutes before raising the alarm - is a mystery. 'But in another sense, why you did it seems clear enough. It was because you were out of your head due to the lethal combination of alcohol and cannabis which you had taken that day and because of your fascination with fire, particularly when you are affected by drink or drugs.' The judge continued: 'If you had not been drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis, four young people would still be alive and several other lives would not have been blighted. 'But although you were intoxicated, you were not so intoxicated that you did not know what you were doing. 'While you did not intend to cause serious harm to the children, you knew what you were doing in starting the fire and you had ample experience of the danger of fire. 'He said a life term was required because Allen was someone who poses a significant risk of harm to the public.' Four-year-olds Holly and Ella Smith and their two-year-old brother Jordan were asleep as the blaze took hold . Allen - who sobbed throughout the hearing - would only be released when he was no longer deemed a risk, he said. Allen was cleared of murdering the siblings. He denied all the charges and claimed it was not him who had started the fire. The defendant was the only other person who was upstairs at the dormer bungalow when the fire broke out, said the Crown. Reece Smith (pictured) died as he tried to save his twin sisters and little brother . The fatal fire took hold from hanging clothes in a wardrobe in the bedroom shared by the three young children and their mother. Three family friends were also in the house with the defendant who was a friend of another of Ms Smith’s sons. Allen was a regular visitor and stayed overnight the evening before the blaze, the jury was told. He spent most of the night on January 7 in the second upstairs bedroom, according to those who were in the house, said prosecutor Neil Flewitt QC. Ms Smith, 37, said she said remembered the lights going off and then the defendant jumped down the stairs and shouted 'Fire' before he ran through the kitchen and out of the back door. Ms Smith told police that smoke alarms had been fitted at the top and bottom of the stairs but Reece had taken them down in the days before the fire because one or both of them kept making beeping noises. Mr Flewitt told the jury that several 'extremely detailed investigations' had taken place into the cause of the fire and the unanimous view of the experts was that it was started deliberately. One expert concluded the fire started in the hanging clothes in the wardrobe, and the most likely source of ignition was a naked flame. Giving evidence, Allen admitted his involvement in starting a locker fire when he was a pupil at his former high school and also setting fire to a local field. But he denied claims that he sprayed flaming aerosols at a house party in March 2011. Mr Justice Males said he had not grown out of a history of playing with fires. He said he was satisfied that under the influence of drugs and drink he did terrorise teenage girls at the 2011 party with his makeshift 'flame thrower'. And the week before the deaths he lit an aerosol spray at the house in Lytham Road. The judge said Allen left the bedroom and waited for the fire to take hold. The scene of the housefire in which four siblings died. Following detailed investigations' into the cause of the fire, experts agreed that it was started deliberately . He only came down the stairs to raise the alarm when the intense heat melted the aluminium light fitting and caused the electricity in the house to fail. 'The fire had awoken the three children,' said Mr Justice Males. 'They could be heard calling for their mother. 'One of the twins, Ella, stood on the molten carpet and suffered what must have been agonising burns to her feet. 'But in the dark and the heat and the smoke the frightened children were unable to find their way out of the bedroom and all attempts to rescue them were beaten back due to the smoke.' He told Allen he had lied repeatedly to the police and in court, and also in his evidence had tried to shift the blame on to a young girl with a troubled background who was also at the party. He accepted that Allen regretted the deaths but added that 'remorse is to be judged by your conduct as a whole, including the many lies you told in an attempt to save your own skin with no apparent sense of shame'. 'This is a factor to which I can give very limited weight,' he said. Four-year-old Holly and Ella Smith's bedroom where Dyson Allen started the fire which killed them and their two brothers . The charred remains of clothes recovered from the children's room . Allen's propensity to play with fire was fuelled by drink and drugs, Mr Justice Males continued. 'But you have failed completely to recognise the dangerous nature of such conduct which, when you are drunk or drugged, you regard as funny or as a kind of party trick. 'I do not accept that there is now little or no risk because you have learned your lesson. 'If you were going to learn a lesson, it might have been expected that you would do so long ago when on one occasion you injured yourself as a result of your games with fire. But you did not learn then and your games continued.' The judge said many of the witnesses present in the house were either drunk or stoned which 'presented obvious challenges'. But he said the 'meticulous and highly professional work' of Lancashire Fire & Rescue Service had left no doubt the fire was started deliberately and without that it was doubtful whether Allen would have been brought to justice. David Fish QC, defending, said his client was 'industrious' until he started taking cannabis in his mid-teens. The drug use 'took its toll' and he lost his job as an apprentice mechanic. He said it may be concluded that the deaths would not have happened if the defendant had not consumed cannabis on the night of the fire. 'This was, and remains, an entirely motiveless offence,' he said. 'No-one on either side can identify any motive at all.'There had been no bad blood between Dyson Allen and the Smith family. 'We say the taking of drugs explains but does not excuse these offences.' Allen maintains his innocence, but a psychiatrist who saw him as part of his pre-sentence report had noted that cannabis use could 'completely erase' events from memory. Mr Fish said the defendant came from 'a broken and, it may be thought, dysfunctional home'. He had never known his father and was not close with his mother. Allen had been staying temporarily at the Smith house at the time of the fire after he had a row with his grandmother about his cannabis use. 'He got on well with the whole of the Smith family,' said his barrister. 'He was personally very happy there.'","Dyson Allen, 19, had taken a 'lethal combination' of alcohol and cannabis .

The shambolic Olympic security firm G4S is bidding for the right to print Britain’s banknotes, it emerged last night. The embattled group has teamed up with a French company to try to get its hands on the lucrative £1billion contract. Currently the work is done by the British firm De La Rue, which was first commissioned to print UK banknotes at the outbreak of the First World War. G4S, which has faced calls to be barred from public work after a string of scandals, wants to take over the contract . Now G4S, which has faced calls to be barred from public work after a string of scandals, wants to take over the contract. It has joined forces with France’s Oberthur Technologies, which would take control of the printing process itself. Labour MP Keith Vaz, who has called for the company to be blacklisted from future taxpayer contracts, demanded G4S pull out of the bidding. He said: ‘G4s have failed the public on numerous occasions. ‘At a recent public meeting Jon Shaw, a G4S director, agreed with the Home Affairs Select Committee that companies that fail to deliver on public contracts should be on a high risk register. The group faced public outrage last summer when it failed to provide enough guards for the Olympic venues. The army was drafted in to make up the shortfall . ‘In light of this they should withdraw their application for this important contract until they have got their house in order.’ Before 2003 the Bank of England managed its own banknote printing. In 2003 the Bank gave the work to De La Rue, which has held the contract for ten years. Now it is has put the job out to tender. The winning company will be responsible for printing notes from 2015 to 2025, with the possibility of extending the work even further to 2028. But even if G4S and its Franco partner win, they will have to print the notes in the UK. Any successful company can only print the notes using the Bank’s secure printing works in Debden in the Epping Forest. From there the notes are taken securely to the Bank’s cash distribution centres around the country. The Bank has issued paper banknotes ever since the central bank was created in 1694 as a way of raising money for King William III’s war against France. But now it is planning to issue plastic notes, which can survive a spin in the washing machine. Polymer banknotes, as well as being hard to fake, are durable and stay cleaner for longer because the material is more resistant to dirt and moisture. Whichever firm wins the contract will have to be able to produce them as well as paper notes, the Bank has said. Current provider De La Rue entered the plastic banknote market earlier this year with deals to supply Fiji and Mauritius. G4S has been embroiled in a number of public blunders over the last 18 months. The group faced public outrage last summer when it failed to provide enough guards for the Olympic venues. The army was drafted in to make up the shortfall, and G4S was forced to pay compensation. In July the company was accused of charging taxpayers for electronic tags on prisoners who were either dead, in jail or had left the country. Ministers said they would review the company’s entire portfolio of government work - worth almost £1billion a year. The blunders happened on the watch of flamboyant boss Nick Buckles, who was forced to resign earlier this year after a humiliating warning that the company’s profits would fall short of expectations.

I couldn't believe it after all these years.' Dave had saved up to buy the ring for Brenda before the pair married in September 1969. She had only been wearing it for three years when she lost it while uprooting veg near their home on the outskirts of Mawnan Smith, Cornwall. But the treasure hunter managed to find the ring in almost exactly the same spot where Brenda had dropped it. Happy day: Incredibly, the ring was still in near-perfect condition, despite being buried beneath soil for 41 years . Mr Caunter's brother Arthur handing him the ring before his wedding: He had saved up for the 9-carat band . The couple took the ring to a local jewellers to have a small crack repaired but it's now as good as new and back on Brenda's finger. She said: 'I was working in the field when I took my gloves off, and that's probably when it came off. 'When we got the phone call to say it had been found I didn't know what to say.' The ring's locator, who wishes to remain anonymous, said: 'It was in absolutely perfect condition, despite the number of years it had been there. 'I'm interested in history and I have often found medieval coins which are absolutely fascinating. That's why I was up there.'","Green-fingered Brenda Caunter, 62, lost ring on her allotment in 1972 .

Reluctant: Joshua Silverman won't be pinning his hopes on popularity in jail after he was given the chance to escape - and called 911 . A prisoner won't be pinning his hopes on popularity in jail after finding himself caught up in the middle of an escape - and calling 911. Joshua Silverman was given the chance to flee when two other inmates hijacked the van he was being transported in, which had been left unattended outside a hospital in Weatherford, Oklahoma. Unbelievably, instead of making a run for it, he dialed 911 and alerted the police about the escape. 'Ma'am, you're probably not going to believe this, but I'm a prisoner in a van, and I'm here with a couple of these other cats,' he politely explained to the emergency operator. 'A couple of the guys that were in the van jacked the van at the hospital.' The security vehicle was being driven by guards from the Prison Transportation Service when it stopped at the hospital on Tuesday to drop off some ill inmates. The guards accompanied the sick prisoners into the building - leaving eight other inmates unsupervised in the vehicle. They also left keys in the van's ignition so the prisoners could have air conditioning. Inmates Lester Burns and Michael Coleman took their chance to escape - kicking out a partition in the van, before moving up front and driving off. They travelled for about a mile before ditching the vehicle and fleeing on foot, according to police. However, Silverman, one of six inmates left behind, was reluctant to escape. Still shackled, he managed to climb out of the van and dial 911 with a mobile phone police believe he might have found in the vehicle. Scroll down for video . Hijack: Prisoners Lester Burns and Michael Coleman drove the stolen van for about a mile before ditching it and fleeing on foot. They were recaptured by police on Tuesday evening . Silverman struggled to explain the van's whereabouts to the operator - but volunteered to walk to a nearby road to flag down an officer. 'We're in Oklahoma somewhere. I don't know because we're not on a road and I'm not from here,' he said. 'I just don't want to get shot by no cops or nothing.' The operator then asked Silverman where the rest of the prisoners were. 'We're all in the van,' said Silverman. 'Two of the dudes took off. The dudes that were doing whatever they were doing took off.' The prisoner remained on the phone until a police officer arrived on the scene. Stolen: The inmates commandeered a van operated by Prisoner Transportation Services . Silverman, who was in custody on drug-related charges, was being taken to Wisconsin when the van was hijacked, according to Weatherford assistant police chief Louis Flowers. Wisconsin court records indicate the prisoner had been convicted of bail jumping, drug manufacturing and disorderly conduct over the past few years. Mr Flowers said Silverman's call had helped police narrow their search for Burns and Coleman, who were recaptured and taken back into custody on Tuesday evening. 'It helped us locate them a lot quicker,' said Mr Flowers. 'We didn't know what direction they were traveling in and his call helped us pinpoint their location.' All of the inmates were from jails in the western and northern U.S. and were being transported to agencies in those parts of the country.

A murderer who was executed by lethal injection yesterday said that his fate should serve as a warning to stop people taking drugs. Arturo Diaz, 37, died in Hunstville prison, Texas, after being injected with pentobarbital as punishment for killing a young man in 1999. His death was witnessed by his mother and grandmother, as well as relatives of Michael Nichols, whom Diaz murdered. Before he received his injection, Diaz said he hoped his death 'serves as an example for some youngsters... Think about it before you do drugs'. He also turned to Forrest Nichols, Michael's father, and said: 'I hope this can bring some relief for you and your family'. He had previously smiled and blown a kiss to his watching relatives, telling them in Spanish 'I am with God'. After the injections Diaz took several deep breaths, started snoring, and stopped moving in less than a minute. Mr Nichols described the execution as 'way too easy'. Diaz, from the small town of Las Milpas, killed Michael Nichols, then 25, in his apartment in the nearby town of McAllen. He later confessed to being drunk and on drugs during the attack. Evidence suggested that he had tried to steal Mr Nichols's pickup truck as well, but could not get out of a locked gate in the apartment complex. Execution: Diaz was given a lethal injection of pentobarbital strapped to this stretcher in the death chamber in Hunstville, Texas . His shoeprint was found on the gate's keypad and DNA evidence was also found on a beer bottle in the apartment. He was also convicted of attempted murder and aggravated robbery.

Quiet day at the office: Radio 1 Djs including Fearne Cotton, pictured, today, were banned from speaking . Listeners of Radio 1 witnessed something of a first today when they tuned into the BBC's popular music station to hear... music. And only music. Presenters Nick Grimshaw, Fearne Cotton, Scott Mills and Greg James are being forced to keep schtum for 12 hours - with Twitter as the only outlet for their usual chatter. Continuous music has played from 7am until 7pm - and judging by the reactions on Twitter, listeners were pleased to have some respite from the vocal inputs of the station's DJs. The station, which is keen to attract . a somewhat younger audience than the 30-year-old crowd who used to tune . into Chris Moyles, announced the stunt as the end to their Even More . Music Month of September - which saw 'some of the biggest names in . music' perform in the station's live lounge including Justin Timberlake . and Laura Mvula. The only verbal interruptions came in the form of from news updates from the Radio 1 Newsbeat team, Chris Smith and Tulip Mazunda. Those who were desperate to get some . of the usual banter during today's spell of quiet were invited to turn . to the station's official Twitter feed, @BBCR1, where the four DJs were . granted a chance to let off steam. From . the start, listeners expressed their relief at the calm, with Jack Goff . tweeting at the time of Nick Grimshaw's usual breakfast show: 'Been . listening for almost 2 hours now and not heard Nick Grimshaw's voice . once. #perfect'. Several Twitter users said that it was good to hear the station doing what it was designed for.

Relief: Nick Grimshaw's breakfast show was the first moment listeners heard - and relished - the sound of music uninterrupted . Sound of silence: Listeners said that it was a change to hear a music station playing actual music . Miffed: Some Twitter users confessed that they missed the casual banter of the Radio 1 presenters as music rang out over the airwaves . Bemused: The stunt passed some listeners by for several hours before they realised the presenters were nowhere to be heard . Michael Ridout tweeted: 'It's so good listening to the radio when there's no talking. Well played'. There . were, however, one or two who apparently missed the friendly chit-chat . of Fearne et al. Twitter user . Harry Foster wrote: 'Don't like . that #Radio1 aren't letting the DJs talk today. That's what I listen . for'. And Neil Phillips was . one who confessed that he hadn't even noticed the difference, tweeting - . at around 3.30pm - 'Listening to #radio1 since 7.50am, only just . noticed no one is talking. In a world of my own'. Meanwhile, the presenters themselves appeared to have adopted coping strategies to deal with this day-long challenge. Phew! Challenge complete, Fearne Cotton, left, leaves the BBC Radio 1 studio after the challenge, which kicked off with Nick Grimshaw, pictured right, this morning . Fidgety Fearne: The presenter finds it tough to get used to the alternative to usual listener phone-ins . A picture is worth... Fearne Cotton creates doodles to describe the songs that are coming up. Any guesses? Fearne Cotton seemed to get a bit . angsty without any verbal feedback, and began demanding more interaction . from Radio 1 listeners. In the end she took to inflicting 'doodles' on the Twitter feed to help listeners 'guess' which songs were coming up. Scott Mills apparently found the challenge almost impossible, tweeting after less than an hour: 'I WANNA TALK!!!!' And the DJs eventually made do with 'writing along' to the lyrics of songs such as Mariah Carey's We Belong Together. Chatterboxes: Greg James, left, and Scott Mills, right, were forced to keep silent throughout their shows . Too tough: Scott Mills almost caves in on his airwaves silence, relying on Twitter to release the tension . Write-along: The presenters do their best to join in, but it just isn't quite the same on Twitter... Of course, there was still time for those endearing antics for which the Radio 1 team are so beloved. Scott Mills's sidekick Chris at one stage took over the Twitter feed while Mills had gone for a break and changed his profile picture. Greg James - who took over from 4pm - joked that he had spent the previous day scheduling tweets so he could bunk off in Brighton. By 7pm, all will be back to normal, and the presenters will return to their usual slots on Monday morning.","Twitter users express relief for Radio 1's 12-hour DJ silence .

The Brazilian athlete was rushed to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Souza weighed 185 pounds, according to Sherdog.com. Souza's Nova Uniao teammate, Andre Santos, believes the fighter's shocking death was related to his weight loss. 'We don’t have much information yet, but we do know that is related to his weight cut,' he told MMA Fighting. 'He’s my student but he also trains at Nova Uniao for about a year. 'I wasn’t with him during this process because I have a fight scheduled in Russia, so he spent the night at Nova Uniao’s gym. 'His sister called me saying that he had passed out so I went to the hospital, but he was already dead when I got there.' MMA fighters are known to lose as . much as 20 pounds within five days in preparation for a weigh-in  getting rid of excess water and sticking to a strict diet.

A chemical in Martian soil could burn away any evidence of life before scientists are able to find it. Perchlorate, a salt made up of chlorine and oxygen, has been shown to interfere with techniques used by the Mars Curiosity rover to analyse soil samples. The chemical was first discovered last year when Curiosity trekked around Mars’ Rocknest sand dune. Perchlorate, a salt made up of chlorine and oxygen, has been shown to interfere with techniques used by the Mars Curiosity rover to analyse soil samples . When heated, perchlorates can cause a chemical reaction that destroys organic carbon. Daniel Glavin, an astrobiologist at Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said he now believes the troublesome perchlorates are likely prevalent throughout the Martian surface. 'The presence of perchlorates isn't good news for some of the techniques we're currently using with Curiosity,' said Mr Glavin. 'This may change the way we search for organics in the future on Mars.' The Curiosity rover's Sample Analysis on Mars (SAM) system tests soil by heating them in an instrument, called a pyrolysis gas chromatograph mass spectrometer. The chemical was first discovered last year when Curiosity trekked around Mars' Rocknest sand dune . These break the samples down into their chemical components and determine precisely how much of each of those components is present in the sample. Any perchlorate salts in the heated sample decompose as the temperature goes above 200 degrees Celsius and release pure oxygen. Perchlorates are the salts derived from perchloric acid (pictured). Hydrogen atom are shown in white, oxygen in red and chlorine in green . Organic molecules in the sample exposed to this oxygen will then combust into carbon dioxide, destroying the molecular evidence of their presence. Luckily, Glavin said, some organic carbon would likely survive, either incased in more heat-resistant materials or detected before the breakdown of perchlorates. But Glavin noted that scientists can account for the destroyed organic carbon by assuming a certain amount of perchlorate will always be in the Martian soil. In future tests, scientists can calculate how much organic carbon burnt away with the decomposing perchlorates in order to estimate the original amount of organic material in the soil. 'It will be absolutely critical as we move on to other samples to compare them to the Rocknest dune to infer the presence or absence of Martian organic material,' said Glavin. Glavin added that Curiosity has the potential to avoid the perchlorate problem in the future by using techniques that do not involve heating the soil to the point where perchlorates break down. The rover already carries an apparatus capable of that, which it hasn't yet used.","Perchlorates have been shown to interfere with Curiosity's analysis .

Divers have found the body of a missing U.S. stunt pilot whose plane crashed into a lake in northeast China while attempting a tricky maneuver in the rain, the head of the team searching for him said Friday. David Riggs, whose U.S. pilot's license had been suspended, had been missing since Tuesday's accident outside the city of Shenyang in which his young female Chinese translator died. Riggs was in China to take part in an air show and was apparently rehearsing one of his tricks when the accident occurred. Zhang Fang said Riggs' body was found during a search of the bottom of Lake Caihu by divers from the Dalian branch of the Beihai Rescue Bureau. Dangerous pilot: David Riggs twice had his pilot's license suspended in the US before crashing Tuesday to his death . 'It's likely he was killed on impact, but we don't know for sure yet,' Fang said by telephone from the accident scene. Riggs' high-performance single-engine Lancair 320 plane broke into pieces after hitting the lake and some parts had been recovered, including one of its two seats. The cause of the accident remains under investigation. The plane was not equipped with a ""black box"" recorder because of its small size. Zhang said Riggs crashed while attempting a stunt in which the wheels of his plane were to drag along the lake surface at high speed. He had just taken off in a light rain, but there was no indication he had violated any flying regulations, Zhang said. Other reports said Chinese officials had urged Riggs not to take off, but Zhang said he had no information about that. Riggs was a well-known Hollywood stunt pilot, and the center of considerable controversy over a string of legal problems and penchant for self-promotion. Fearless: Mr Riggs often performed dangerous stunts at very high speeds . Riggs' website touts his credentials as a holder of several aviation speed world records, but doesn't mention the fact his U.S. pilot's license had been suspended twice. The first time was after buzzing the famed Santa Monica pier in Los Angeles in his Vodochody L-39 Albatros jet trainer. Riggs was sentenced to 60 days of community service and 60 days in jail for reckless flying. He lost his license again in November for selling rides in his plane without permission. The prosecution came after a plane piloted by a business partner crashed, killing both people on board. Death machine: Mr Riggs crashed flying his plane while practicing stunts for an upcoming airshow . Riggs had a stack of other legal problems, including convictions for bank, wire and passport fraud. He aroused such contempt among some pilots that a website - aviationcriminal.com - was devoted to chronicling his misdoings. His website describes him as CEO of California-based Mach One Aviation, Inc. and as a 'Hollywood stunt pilot, movie producer and world aviation speed record holder.' It said his aerial performances had featured in movies and television shows including 'Iron Man,' 'Jarhead,' and the James Bond film 'Casino Royale.' China's official Xinhua News Agency said other U.S. flyers scheduled to take part in Friday's opening ceremony had pulled out of the show. Pilots and aircraft from Sweden, France and Lithuania were due to take part in the show.","David Riggs crashed his plane Tuesday while practicing stunts .

The elderly grandfather had been on the run for 36 years when he was arrested this week (right) Detective Sgt Joel Ware, from Garland County Sheriff's Department, told ABC: 'It's good to have him answer to justice, . but to take an elderly person with medical issues, who has otherwise . lived a quiet, peaceful life, never causing any problems, went to church . every Sunday, it was bittersweet.' The officer said that Morrow had been very cooperative during his arrest but emotional although there appeared to be some relief after he had spent the past three decades always looking over his shoulder. Morrow had been living as law-abiding Mr Wilson for 36 years. He had got married and had three children and grandchildren. His family were unaware that the elderly grandfather had been living under an alias and had fled a criminal past. On the lam: Morrow, in a mugshot from 1973, had kept his criminal past a secret from his wife, children and grandchildren . Morrow is being held on a charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. He is in Garland County Jail waiting to be extradited to California. Morrow had escaped from the California Institute for Men in Chino on August 27, 1977, federal authorities said, while serving time for first-degree robbery. He has not yet revealed how he escaped from prison but Sgt Ware said it was a 'pretty good plan'. Morrow was finally tracked down after investigators matched his fingerprints to those of a man using the name of Carl Frank Wilson, who was arrested in Saline County, Arkansas, in 1984. Some neighbors told ArkansasMatters.com they knew Murrow had been incarcerated before but they had no idea he had escaped prison. 'You . live beside somebody for fourteen years, but you really don't know . them. You thought you knew them. That's what's spooky,' neighbor Randy . Edmonds told the station. Security: Morrow escaped from the California Institute for Men in Chino on August 27, 1977 and is now being extradited back to the state . 'We knew him as Frank, but he was a good neighbor we never had any trouble with him. He was just up here raising a family,' Sherry Miller told Channel 7 News. She was neighbors with Morrow for more than 20 years. Arkansas FBI Supervisory Special Agent Kimberly Brunell said: 'This case is special in that he escaped so many years ago, but it just highlights law enforcement working together.' Morrow is being held on a charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.","Michael Ray Morrow was sentenced in .

A professional horse trainer has been shot dead in front of his partner in the Long Island home they shared in what police believe was a targeted attack. Ross Reisner, a popular riding school instructor in the Hamptons, was killed by a bullet fired through the window of his house on Tuesday evening. The 50-year-old's family described it as a 'planned, professional murder' and police believe the gunman was deliberately targeting the couple. Targeted: Ross Reisner, right, was at home with his partner Kevin Murray, left, when he was shot . They had just finished dinner at about 8.45pm when several bullets were fired, killing Mr Reisner and grazing the arm of Kevin Murray, whom he had been in a relationship with for 26 years. Neighbors in quiet, wealthy Setauket, on Long Island's Gold Coast, recalled hearing gunfire and screams for help. 'I did hear a male voice screaming, ""Oh God, help him. Please help me. Help him,"" neighbor Michelle O’Toole told CBS New York. The victim's family said a high-powered weapon was used in the attack and Suffolk County police commander John Fitzpatrick said: 'It's clear that person was firing at them.' He added that the gunman had stood in the couple's yard and waited for the men to appear in the window before shooting. The suspect is then believed to have fled on foot. Gunned down: The attacker is believed to have fired through the window of the couple's home on Tuesday . Stake out: Police markers are left in the couple's lawn. The gunman is believed to have fired from the yard . Mr Reisner's brother told the Daily News a 45-year-old long-time friend from Manhattan was allegedly being sought over the murder. 'He was an old friend and now this . craziness. There was something weird . going on, some bad blood,' Ian Reisner claimed. His brother was a well-known equestrian in the North East, who had been competing since he was a teenager. He had recently opened a horse farm in Mattituck with childhood friend Bobby Ginsberg, and the two had been enjoying a successful start to their venture. 'When it came to his training and his riding, he was very serious and dedicated to it - he loved to win,' Mr Ginsberg said. 'On his downtime, he was just one of the funniest people you'd ever hope to meet.' Well known: Ross Reisner, pictured left with rider Grace Duy, was a professional trainer . Tributes: Many of the riders Ross, pictured right, helped train posted pictures and tributes to him online . He told Three Village Patch he was shocked that his friend and business partner had been murdered, and added: 'Everybody knew Ross. He always had clients at the horse shows. He was always striving to be a great trainer and rider.' The victim's brother said: 'He taught members of high profile families how to ride. He was at the top of his profession.' Mr Reisner was shot dead in the $600,000 home the couple had been remodeling. 'They had just built their dream house five-and-a-half years ago,' Ms O’Toole, who says she heard at least six gun shots, said. Mr Reisner was due to take a riding team to the U.S. Equestrian Federation finals in New Jersey next month. As news of his death reached equestrian circles, many posted tributes to their trainer and fellow horseman on Facebook. Dedicated: Ross, with his partner of 26 years, Kevin, was a keen horseman . Shocking: The quiet neighborhood where the couple had their dream home is reeling from news of the shooting . Grace Duy described him as 'not just an amazing trainer but an extraordinary friend.' Many others, including Alexandra Maracic, posted photos of Mr Reisner walking show jumping courses with them and offering advice at competitions. Shanette Barth Cohen, who runs the Hampton Classic horse show, said: 'He was very well-liked and it’s a real shock and sad for the whole Long Island equestrian community.'","Ross Reisner shot dead in front of his partner at their dream house .

Fitness fail: Chief Constable Jacqui Cheer attempted the 'bleep test' but came up short . The police chief who helped catch the Suffolk Strangler has become the first Chief Constable to fail to meet the new police fitness targets. Jacqui Cheer, boss of the Cleveland force, is believed to be the highest ranking officer to flunk the bleep test - while trying to set an example to her staff. The force admitted she scored 4.2 on the test, compared to the 5.4 her rank and file officers will need to ensure their jobs are safe when the fitness checks come in officially in 12 months' time. Mrs Cheer, 52, joined Essex Police in 1984 and spent 28 years in uniform. She headed the investigation of the five prostitute murders in Ipswich in 2006, for which serial killer Steve Wright was jailed. Mrs Cheer was played by the TV and film actress Jo McInnes in Five Daughters, the television drama based on the case. It is understood many Cleveland officers already regard the targets as a farce and their own commander failing to measure up has made them even more scornful. One source said: ‘They just think the whole thing is a nonsense anyway. They think it's a complete joke.’ Expert Prof Craig Jackson, co-author of the report Are Police Fitness Tests Accurate?, said: ‘This is what happens when senior management try to lead by example. ‘It can go horribly wrong. ‘People might think it was just paying lip service to the fitness test and I would be interested to know if she did any training for it. Plodding is out of the question for officers if they want to pass the 'bleep test'. The setting for these tests is usually a large sports hall and the candidates must run continuously between two points set 15 metres apart. The pace for the runs is set by an audio track that plays continuous beeps, with officers required to reach the fixed points before the beep sounds. The interval between the beeps gradually lessens, so officers have to run faster and faster. The total amount of running time is usually around three and a half minutes. Officers are allowed three warnings if they fall behind the pace. If they can't speed up sufficiently and hit the fixed points before the beep sounds the instructor will fail them. ‘The only way she could turn this into a success by getting fit and passing it. That would win over the officers and people's perceptions.’ Some forces favour an assault course which mimics what front line officers do during the working day, such as crawling and climbing. The Birmingham City University expert's research suggests this obstacle course is unfair because it excludes too many female officers while letting too many podgy males through. But he believes the shuttle run used by forces such as Cleveland is fair to both sexes and ‘a fail is a fail’. He was not aware of any other Chief Constables taking and failing the test. ‘It's good to see one having a go but it seems to have backfired in this particular case and is not good PR,’ he added. A spokesman for the Police Federation . of England and Wales said: ‘The Police Federation feels that police . officers should be fit to perform the role they do and we need to be . realistic about the fact that a Chief Constable is not going to be . knocking down doors and arresting people in the town centre on a . Saturday night. ‘We . do have some concerns about the fairness of national fitness testing . proposals, and will continue to engage with ACPO and the College of . Policing to ensure these concerns are addressed.’ Time trial: The bleep test involves a series of 15-metre shuttle runs at ever increasing speed . After rising through the ranks, Mrs Cheer joined Suffolk Constabulary in 2006 as Assistant Chief Constable after working in the Home Office Reform Unit. After helping snare the Suffolk Strangler, she joined Cleveland Police - initially as Temporary Chief Constable - in 2011 when predecessor Sean Price was suspended and later sacked for misconduct following a probe into corruption allegations at the force. Under the Government plans, officers have to reach level 5.4 of the bleep or 'beep test', which involves completing a series of 15-metre shuttle runs at ever increasing speed. If they succeed, they will have been able to run for 3 minutes 34 seconds. Those who fail will be given a fitness plan and 12 months to measure up - or face dismissal for 'unsatisfactory performance'. At one stage, failure was to be regarded as a disciplinary offence. Now officers are given support and time to pass. A Cleveland Police spokeswoman said: ‘The fitness tests started as a pilot this month and will be implemented in September 2014 for officers who undertake safety training for roles such as patrolling. ‘Over the summer, a familiarisation exercise was run so that officers could see what the tests would entail, and the Chief Constable took part in the full day as she was keen to see what tests the officers would undergo, as well as supporting her staff. ‘As she does not undertake an active operational role, she is not required to take the fitness test.’The Association of Chief Police Officers refused to comment Mrs Cheer's performance, saying it would not discuss a specific case. ACC Robin Merrett, national fitness working group lead said: ‘Annual fitness testing is being introduced to policing and involves a 15m shuttle run to be completed to an endurance level of 5:4 and is compliant with equality legislation.’ There is no obstacle course or upper strength testing as part of this annual fitness test. ‘We will be ensuring that the fitness test does not unlawfully discriminate against gender or other protected groups, and for the first 12 month the College of Policing will audit data on pass and failures to understand how specific groups are performing.’ The College of Policing, which is the guiding light of the new fitness regime, underlined there was no instant dismissal threat for officers who failed to measure up. The scheme was being piloted for 12 months and staff would be given support to pass.If an officer repeatedly failed it would be an operational matter for the individual force whether disciplinary measures were required. But there was no reference in the official guidelines to dismissal, the College said.","Cleveland Police Chief Constable Jacqui Cheer came up short on a time trial .

Duewa Lee (pictured), 37, was sentenced to life in prison on Thursday for brutally torturing her fiancee's 12-year-old daughter . A Northern California woman who burned, whipped and brutalized her fiancé's daughter while he was in prison has been convicted of torture and sentenced to life behind bars. A judge sentenced 37-year-old Duewa Lee immediately following her conviction by a jury on Thursday on 11 felony counts. Lee received an indeterminate life term on the torture conviction, plus another nine years for the other counts related to the abuses endured by the girl. The girl was 12 at the time of the abuse and is now 14. She told jurors that over several months Lee burned her with an iron and hot spatulas, threw her down stairs, refused to let her eat, smashed her head into a window and forced her to stand for hours. 'I had to stand in the corner, and I had to hold both of my hands up in the air, and I had to hold one of my legs up,' said the 12- year-old victim in her testimony in the Sacramento Superior court on Tuesday. Deputy District Attorney Nancy Cochrane said in her opening statement that the abuse began when the girl's father, Wade Curtis Carter, who is now 40, was arrested for robbery in 2011 and then imprisoned. Wade Curtis Carter (pictured), 40, is the 12-year-old victim's imprisoned father . According to The Sacramento Bee Lee had six children of her own and was pregnant with a seventh by the imprisoned Carter. According to Assistant Public Defender Mike Nelson, 'Duewa Lee did not cause the injuries to (the girl), her father did.' The girl said in her testimony on Tuesday that she got in trouble with her father on occasion for lying and was forced to stand in a corner. He never made her raise her hands in the air and lift one foot off the floor. Everything was generally OK in the home, the girl testified, until her father's arrest in 2011. Then, she said, Lee gave her housework and yelled at her. Her relationship with Lee crumbled. The girl told how she was standing in Lee's bedroom corner one night and, 'she turned her iron on, and she thought I was lying about something, and she burned me with the iron... 'She was yelling in my face, and she burned me. … She said something about her being pregnant and me trying to make her feel bad.' 'She would say, ""This is what you get"" for whatever I did,' the girl told the jury. According to United Press International, the victim has been in protective custody ever since she got help from a DMV employee. Lee took the child to the DMV, and when Lee was in the bathroom, the victim pleaded for help. Investigators took the victim to get medical attention for her injuries. They believe that was the first time any of her wounds were treated . Sacramento Child protective Services also took Lee's six biological children into custody. They would not comment on their condition.","Duewa Lee also threw the child down the stairs .

The owners of a Colorado cantaloupe farm behind one of the deadliest foodborne illness outbreaks in U.S. history have been arrested by federal authorities. Jensen Farms, owned by Eric and Ryan Jensen, was revealed to be the source of contaminated melons that killed 33 people and sickened at least 140 across 28 states in 2011. The Jensens, who went bankrupt in the wake of the contamination scandal, are charged with introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Eric Jensen, pictured, and his brother Ryan were both taken into custody by federal investigators today . 'As this case so tragically reminds us, food processors play a critical role in ensuring that our food is safe,' U.S. Attorney John Walsh said. 'They bear a special responsibility to ensure that the food they produce and sell is not dangerous to the public. Where they fail to live up to that responsibility, and as these charges demonstrate, this office and the Food and Drug Administration have a responsibility to act forcefully to enforce the law.' The Denver Post reports that federal investigators rarely pursue criminal charges against owners involved foodborne illness cases - and only if there is evidence that they knew of or ignored evidence of possible contamination. There has been no public indication that there was such a lapse that led to the cantilope disaster as Jensen Farms two years ago, according to the Post. It is unknown whether federal investigators have evidence of the Jensens ignoring information about possible contamination. An investigation found that the process the Jensens used for washing their melons allowed dirty water to pool and re-contaminate countless cantaloupes (stock picture) Instead, investigators have questioned the methods that the Granada, Colorado, farm used to cleaning the how fruit that was picked from fields. At the time, federal guidelines were not clear on whether melons should be washing in a bath of sanitizing solution or simply sprayed off with fresh water. The Jensens had upgraded their facilities prior to the outbreak to use the fresh water method. However, investigators found that the process was originally meant to be used with potatoes and allowed dirty water to collect and re-contaminate the melons.","The 2011 listeria outbreak was second-deadliest foodborne illness incident in U.S. history .

A former professional boxer has been arrested for allegedly murdering his manager in 1987 after a DNA breakthrough allegedly tied him to the crime scene. Exum Speight, 50, was arrested at his home in San Fernando, California on Tuesday in connection with the death of Douglas Stumler, who was found stabbed and strangled at his home 26 years ago. Stumler, 30, worked for the county Housing Authority and had been managing Speight for two years as a side job when he was found dead in his West Los Angeles apartment. A concerned friend discovered his body two days after his death amid signs of a lengthy and violent struggle at the apartment, LAPD Detective Rick Jackson told the Los Angeles Times. Cold case: Former pro-boxer Exum Speight, left, has been arrested for allegedly killing his manager, Douglas Stumler (right), in 1987. The arrest came after DNA allegedly connected him to the scene . Speight had been a suspect early on in the case because he had argued with Stumler over some stolen property. The two men had lived together at one point during the mid-1980s, police said. But Speight was never charged in the death and he continued his boxing career until 2001. He retired having lost 39 of his 50 professional fights. Most famously, Speight was defeated by current heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko in a technical knockout in Austria on November 30, 1996. It was Klitschko's second professional fight. But in 2010, the LA Police Department sent DNA to the Cold Case DNA Program at the National Institute of Justice which found DNA on Stumler's body matched Speight, authorities said. Former star: Old footage shows Speight taking on current heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko in 1996. He lost the fight and eventually retired from boxing in 2001 . New life: Speight, now 50, recently worked as a security guard at a Venice Beach marijuana clinic . Police began collecting witness statements and eventually prosecutors drew up a warrant for his arrest. He was taken into custody by an LAPD-FBI fugitive task force a day later. Stumler was born in Indiana and moved to Los Angeles after graduating from the University of Indiana about six years before his death. He had spent March 29, 1987 with a friend and returned to his apartment alone, but when the friend called him that night, he did not respond, Jackson told the LA Times. He also failed to meet with friends at a Hoosiers NCAA basketball game and, when he didn't turn up for work that week, friends decided to check on him.

Bud Selig plans to retire as baseball commissioner in January 2015 after a term of more than 22 years, he said today. His term has been marked by robust growth in attendance and revenue along with a canceled World Series and a drug scandal. The 79-year-old Selig said in 2003 that he would retire in 2006 but has repeatedly accepted new contracts. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig seen speaking at a news conference at the league's offices in New York in 2008 . Bud Selig, right, gives New York Yankees' Hideki Matsui the MVP trophy after Game 6 of the Major League Baseball World Series in 2009 . Some owners, even his wife, have been skeptical in the past that he really would do it, but this marked the first time he issued a formal statement that he intends to step down from the sport's top job. 'I look forward to continuing its extraordinary growth and addressing several significant issues during the remainder of my term,' he said. Selig said he will soon announce a transition plan that will include a reorganization of central baseball management. He said he will leave on Jan. 24, 2015, which would mark the second-longest term for a baseball commissioner behind Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who served from November 1920 to November 1944. Selig bought the Seattle Pilots in bankruptcy court in 1970 and moved the team to Milwaukee. He became a leading owner by the early 1980s in his role as chairman of the Player Relations Committee, which determined labor policy. He was part of the group that forced . Fay Vincent's resignation and he took over as acting commissioner on . Sept. 9, 1992, in his role as chairman of the executive council. While . he presided over a 7½-month strike in 1994-95 that led to the . cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years, MLB and . its players have had labor peace since. Although he repeatedly said he would not take the job full time, he was formally elected commissioner July 9, 1998. Bud Selig was the man who announced all games through September 2001 were cancelled in the wake of the terror attacks in New York and Washington, D.C (Safeco Field sat empty after 9/11) He turned running the Brewers over to his daughter Wendy, but the Selig family did not sell the franchise until 2005. Selig agreed to new contracts in 2001 and 2004. He first announced his planned retirement in 2003, telling a group from Associated Press Sports Editors he would leave when his current term expired at the end of 2006. 'For a guy who took it in Sept. 9, 1992, and I told my wife it was two-to-four months — 14 years later ... I think that will be enough.'There's no question, because there are other things I really would like to do.' Asked again if this was his final term, Selig responded; 'Oh, there's no question.' He then agreed to new contracts in 2004, 2008 and 2012. Selig was at the helm while baseball was criticized for being slow to react to the rise of performance-enhancing drugs. Management didn't have a drug agreement with its players from October 1985 until August 2002, and drug testing with penalties didn't start until 2004. Selig has repeatedly defended his record, saying baseball acted as fast as it could in a matter that was subject to bargaining with players. Owners have repeatedly praised his financial stewardship, which has led to record franchise values as shown by the $2 billion sale of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012. MLB revenues, which totaled $1.7 billion in 1992, are projected to top $8 billion this year, and the average player salary has tripled under his tenure to more than $3 million.","Selig said in 2003 that he'd retire in 2006 but went back on his word .

An unemployed punter has lost out on more than £8,000 after a bookmaker gave him the wrong odds on a winning bet. Oshane Grant, 42, of Easton, Bristol, was expecting to pocket £9,250 if France, Serbia and Argentina’s football teams all scored at least three goals in their World Cup 2014 qualifying matches. His £100 accumulator with Coral came good when Serbia put three past Wales, France scored four against Belarus and Argentina smashed five past Paraguay in their games last Tuesday. Bet: Oshane Grant, 42, of Easton, Bristol, was expecting to pocket £9,250 if France, Serbia and Argentina's football teams all scored at least three goals in their World Cup 2014 qualifiers . Mr Grant celebrated with a night out with friends before he had picked up his winnings. He was also planning on handing some cash to relatives and spending the rest on a car and decorating his home. But he lost out when Coral refused to pay the full amount. The bookmaker admitted that a clerk had mistakenly given him the odds of the three teams all scoring four or more goals - rather than three. They said they would only pay him £1,216.67 - the total he would have got with the correct odds. But Mr Grant said: ‘I don’t want to hear their excuses. I would like them to give me my money. I went in there, asked for the odds which they had to telephone for and made my bets.

In April 2012, Coral refused to pay out £1,250 on Stoke-based golf fan Lee Beardmore's winning £1 bet on the US Masters. The 39-year-old backed Bubba Watson £1 each-way at 40-1 to win - but an error on his slip gave him Tom Watson's odds of 1000-1. Coral gave him £66 as a goodwill offer. And in September 2008, Jack Waland from County Durham was given 325-1 on Ronaldo scoring first and Manchester United beating Middlesbrough 3-1 in a football match. But when the bet came in, Coral told the 25-year-old student it would only pay him £65 - rather than £815 - based on the 25-1 odds he should have got. Coral apologised and said the error was made by a new staff member. However, one mistake had a happy outcome. In July 2012, Amber Galligan . accidentally bet on different horses to the ones her disabled father had . picked out - but it ended up seeing her convert a £2 stake into a cool . £394,487.

Boris Johnson today put himself on a collision course with David Cameron as he revived calls for an amnesty for illegal immigrants. The Mayor of London said the government had to be 'honest' that when someone has been in Britain for 15 or 20 years 'authorities no longer really pursue you'. But the Prime Minister has rejected the idea, warning last week that it would send out a ‘terrible signal of Britain as a soft touch’. Scroll down for video . Amnesty: Boris Johnson defied warnings from David Cameron to back the idea of allowing illegal immigrants to stay in the UK . The coalition has sought to take a tougher line on immigration, unveiling a raft of measures to curb benefit tourism and deport people in the UK illegally. But Mr Johnson said the failure of border agency staff and the police to find illegal immigrants and send them home meant there was already effectively an amnesty in place. And he blamed 'ambulance-chasing lawyers' who clogged up the legal system with repeated appeals against deportation. Appearing on his new monthly radio phone-in on LBC 97.3, the London Mayor said: 'This is a chronic problem and if you . look at what has happened in this country over the last 20 years, we . have continuously failed to evict anybody. ‘If you look at the number of people . who are staying here illegally and you measure that against the number . that are meant to be on planes, it is absolutely astonishingly small. ‘The culture of human rights, the . immense power of the ambulance-chasing lawyers who immediately come in . and offer people protection against eviction, insert all sorts of delays . into the procedure. It is blindingly difficult to get people on to . planes. ‘They melt away into the maquis, into . the undergrowth, and they are lost again. It is one of the reasons . people lost confidence in the immigration system.’ Ask Boris: Mr Johnson was speaking on his new monthly radio phone-in about the government's approach to immigration . Checks: Mr Johnson told co-host Nick Ferrari (left) that the authorities stop looking for people who have been in the UK illegally for 15 or 20 years . Mr Johnson said he remained convinced . about the need for an amnesty despite the fact that Mr Cameron and other . party leaders ‘turned their machine guns on me’ when he first suggested . it in 2008. ‘We effectively have it,’ he said . after being asked about a recent operation to remove dozens of Romanian . squatters from a derelict former football club in the capital. ‘If you have been here for 10 or 12 . years, I’m afraid the authorities no longer really pursue you. They give . up. Why not be honest about what is going on? Boris Johnson today revealed he could be tempted to run for mayor again - but only if hundreds of thousands of people line the streets demanding it. The Mayor of London dodged questions about his ambitions to be Prime Minister when his term ends in 2016. Instead he revealed he has been talking to friends about the possibility of breaking his promise to only serve eight years in City Hall. Mr Johnson joked that he could be persuaded to stand again if London saw a ‘Reverse Morsi’, referring to the mass protests taking place in Cairo against the Egyptian president. He said politicians should be careful not to ‘do things for too long’ but admitted that he had discussed the idea of staying on with friends. ‘You mean, if it was a sort of a 'reverse Morsi' situation? If there were hundreds of thousands of people actively calling for an extension of the administration?’ he asked. ‘The truth is that there are so many things we are trying to do at the moment that I know I am not going to be able to get in in time for 2016 that it is becoming increasingly... ‘I won't deny it, it is something I think about and something that I've even talked to friends about.' ‘Ultimately you have got to reflect . reality. Otherwise they are not engaged in the economy, they are not . being honest with the system, they are not paying their taxes properly . and it is completely crazy. ‘But the key thing is to kick ‘em out - . get them before they hit first base. Stop them coming in in such . numbers and be much, much tougher in your general approach to borders.’ The Lib Dems suggested an amnesty in . their 2010 election manifesto, but leader Nick Clegg ditched the policy . in March because it was 'seen by many as a reward for breaking the law'. Last week Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi . claimed offering an amnesty to more than half a million illegal migrants . would make financial sense by enabling them to pay tax rather than . subsisting on cash-in-hand jobs. It would boost Tory support among ethnic minorities and stop the undercutting of low-income workers, Mr Zahawi claimed. But he was slapped down by Mr Cameron, who said: ‘It’s not what we are going to implement. I’ve never supported an amnesty. ‘I think that it would send a terrible signal of Britain as a soft touch. ‘What this Government is doing is . making sure we have strong control of our borders, strong control of . immigration, a proper policy of returning people who don’t have a right . to be in the UK.’ Today Mr Zahawi insisted he and Mr Johnson were proposing the 'sensible approach'. 'We have got to tackle this issue because we have got to create harmonious societies,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. 'There are people who've been here for 12 or 15 years working in the cash economy, the black economy. 'If you can bring them out of the shadows, bring them into the real economy, they can contribute to the tax system ... GBP3 billion a year, according to the London School of Economics. 'Coupled with that, you need rigour in your immigration system, border checks, UKBA being able to get people out of the country, not allowing them to use ... human rights legislation.' Warning: David Cameron rejected the idea of an amnesty during a Brussels press conference last week, insisting it would paint Britain as a 'soft touch' The mayor fielded a lot of calls about London’s bus and rail system, and defended controversial bonuses given to transport bosses following last year’s Olympics. He has followed Mr Clegg in hosting a regular phone-in, although the Deputy Prime Minister answers calls one a week. After David Cameron was accused of jinxing tennis star Laura Robson by tweeting a message of support, Mr Johnson declined to use the radio appearance to wish Andy Murray good luck at Wimbledon. ‘If I say `Go Andy!’ or something like that, I will be accused of blighting his chances,’ he joked. However, he did not blame the Prime Minister for cheering on British sports heroes who have later gone down to defeat. ‘David Cameron, like all politicians, wants to offer support to great British athletic stars,’ he said.","London Mayor says it is 'completely crazy' that people who have been in the UK for years are not paying taxes .

Labour's flagship immigration policy was unravelling last night hours after it was launched. Ed Miliband announced that all firms bringing in skilled staff from outside Europe should be forced to take on an equal number of ‘local’ apprentices. The Labour leader, who has struggled to get on the front foot on immigration, said the policy would cut the recruitment of migrants by businesses and improve the skills of British youngsters. Top team: Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) chats with shadow chancellor Ed Balls and shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeves backstage, during the first day of Labour's annual party conference in Brighton . But – under pressure from the Conservatives – Labour was later forced to admit that the 125,000 apprenticeships envisaged by the scheme would be open to youngsters from across the European Union. The idea also met a backlash from the business lobby, which warned the new ‘apprentice tax’ would damage competitiveness and fail to tackle immigration. 'Immigration benefits Britain': John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said businesses should be able to choose the talents and resources the need . A Shadow Cabinet source insisted the policy had been discussed with senior industry figures, adding: ‘Business is cool with this.’ But Simon Walker, of the Institute of Directors, said the initiative would make it ‘even harder’ for firms to take on staff. ‘Several of Labour’s proposals are completely removed from reality and betray the fact that their authors can have had no experience of running a business,’ he said. ‘Compelling companies to take on an apprentice for every non-EU employee is a daft policy which would damage many small and medium-sized businesses just as they are starting to grow.’ John Longworth, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘This is an apprentice tax on employers and job creation. ‘It serves neither to control immigration, where we should have a points system linked more strongly to economic benefit, nor help young people, who should be encouraged and properly supported rather than being used to control immigration by other means. Businesses need to be able to choose the talents and resources they need, and sometimes cannot find in the UK. This immigration benefits Britain. Pressure: Ed Miliband announced that all firms bringing in skilled staff from outside Europe should be forced to take on an equal number of ¿local¿ apprentices . ‘Penalising good companies by making the grant of a work permit conditional on taking on a UK apprentice just raises business costs and new red tape.’ Rumours abounded yesterday that Ed Miliband had had voice coaching to improve his public image. His voice appeared to have dropped an octave when he made a pre-conference appearance on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday. Mr Miliband’s nasal voice has been the subject of speculation, especially over a 2011 nose operation to correct a deviated septum. Labour sources denied voice coaching, saying a cold might explain his deeper voice. The last Labour government’s ‘open door’ policy on migrants has faced fierce public criticism and Mr Miliband yesterday said he wanted a future administration to cut immigration levels. ‘I do want to get low-skill immigration down and therefore overall immigration down,’ he said. The centrepiece of his plan, which he said would be in Labour’s first Queen’s Speech, would be the new policy on apprentices, affecting all firms employing more than 50 people. Mr Miliband said: ‘Any firm that wants . to bring in a foreign worker from outside the EU will also have to train . up someone who is a local worker.’ Tory sources quickly pointed out that . the measure would be illegal under EU law unless youngsters from . elsewhere in Europe were able to apply for the apprenticeships. Labour later climbed down, admitting that young people from across the EU would be eligible. A source said the ‘vast majority’ of the apprenticeships were likely to go to British youngsters. But critics last night pointed out that the posts would be attractive to young people in countries such as Spain, where youth unemployment is running at more than  50 per cent. The Labour leader also announced he would increase fines on employers paying below the minimum wage from £5,000 to £50,000 as part of action against exploitation of migrant workers. He also said he wanted to see the minimum wage ‘go up over time’. An attempt by Labour to restore its battered economic credibility was running into trouble last night before it had even been launched. Journalists had been briefed that Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls will today pledge to have the party’s tax and spending plans audited by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility to give them a gloss of respectability. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has written to the OBR's chairman Robert Chote asking him to amend the watchdog's charter to allow it to scrutinise Labour's plans . But last night it emerged that the OBR’s charter prevents it from offering a view on the spending plans of opposition parties. The agency was set up by George Osborne to provide independent economic forecasts and scrutinise government spending plans. Mr Balls has now written to the OBR’s chairman Robert Chote asking him to amend the watchdog’s charter to allow it to scrutinise Labour’s plans. The move came after Treasury minister Sajid Javid released an analysis by officials which he said showed Labour promises would require more than £1,000 extra borrowing per household in 2015. The analysis suggested Labour’s plans would blow a £28billion black hole in the nation’s finances. Mr Balls dismissed the report as ‘nonsense’. But today he will acknowledge the importance of having Labour’s election plans fully costed to give voters confidence in them. He will say: ‘In tough times it’s even more important that all our policies and commitments are properly costed and funded. ‘The British people rightly want to know that the sums add up. So we will go one step further and ask the independent OBR – the watchdog set up by this Government – to independently audit the costings of every individual spending and tax measure in Labour’s manifesto at the next election. ‘This is the first time a shadow chancellor – the first time any political party in Britain – has ever said it wants this kind of independent audit. A radical change from what’s gone before, but the right thing to do to help restore trust in politics.’ Mr Balls will concede that Labour will face more tough choices and admit that growth and jobs ‘cannot magic the whole deficit away at a stroke’.","Labour's flagship policy to take on a British trainee for every worker from outside the EU was unravelling last night .

Leading radiographer Paul Welch, 59, who has been accused of using a hospital computer to search the web for 'upskirt' images . A man in charge of hospital x-rays used his NHS computer to look for 'upskirt' photos of X-factor judge Nicole Scherzinger, Jennifer Aniston and Britney Spears, a disciplinary panel was told today. Leading radiographer Paul Welch was caught using the hospital computer to search for indecent images of celebrities and erotic fiction about incest, it was claimed. The 59-year-old left his job after he was faced with allegations that he had used a NHS reception computer to search for naked and upskirt pictures  of the stars who also included Beyonce and Miley Cyrus. The married father-of-two also allegedly used the hospital PC to search for father-daughter sex tales during internet sessions. The NHS radiographer denied the claims but retired after 38 years of work following an internal investigation by hospital chiefs, who held him responsible for the searches. Welch was in charge of the radiography department at the West Berkshire Community Hospital in Thatcham, Berkshire, when a colleague 'stumbled upon' the search terms in the browser history on the PC. He was identified as the prime suspect after it emerged he was the only person working in the radiography department at the time when computer records showed the searches were made between May 10 and May 18 last year. When he was quizzed in an internal NHS probe, Welch admitted searching for one unnamed American actress who runs her own lingerie line because he said he knew her personally. However, he denied he had searched for other inappropriate material on the PC just minutes later and described it as a 'coincidence', a disciplinary panel from the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) heard today, which went ahead in his absence. Mary Page, counsel for the HCPC, said the searches took place on May 10, 11 and 18 last year at the reception desk computer in the hospital’s radiography department. The radiographer denied the claims and retired after 38 years of work following an internal investigation by hospital chiefs, who held him responsible for the searches, a disciplinary hearing was told today . 'The inappropriate searches were stumbled upon by a colleague of the registrant (Welch) as they were searching on the computer in the reception area in the hospital,' she said. 'When searching in the search engine box, you put in a number of letters and an auto-fill function shows you previous searches. 'When the colleague saw the list of previous searches, she was immediately concerned as to their content. 'One that particularly concerned her was a search of a female that was known as an acquaintance of the registrant.' The panel was told that woman was an American actress who has her own underwear line. The married father-of-two also allegedly used the hospital PC at West Berkshire Community Hospital to search for taboo father-daughter sex tales . Miss Page said naked pictures of the actress were searched for by Welch on May 10 last year. Twenty seconds later, this was followed by searches for 'Naked celebrities', and 'Nicole Scherzinger panties'. The following day, there was a search for 'Christine Bleakley Simon Cowell 50th birthday party upskirt'. There were also searches for 'Naked celebrities', 'Beyonce Upskirt', 'Britney Spears birthday no panties', and 'Miley Cyrus upskirt'. Miss Page continued that Mr Welch made a number of searches for incest terms. Searches were made for explicit shots of celebrities, including Miley Cyrus . She added: 'Rota documents were compared to the searches and the registrant was identified as the most likely staff member to be responsible. 'Those searches took place between 5pm and 5.30pm approaching the end of the day and towards after-hours.' Miss Page said Welch was interviewed about the searches by Geoff Pinney, a senior pathologist at the Royal Berkshire Hospital Trust, during an internal inquiry in July last year. She said: 'He admitted he may have used the computer and he confirmed searching for female AB. 'He denied searching for any of the other terms found on the search history - even though they were just minutes later - and said it was a coincidence only.' Welch claimed he had been 'set up' by disgruntled staff' and that everyone knew the generic log-in details for the computer and that the PC may even have been accessed remotely. He told Mr Pinney: 'Yes, I’ve heard of Britney Spears but I’m not into celebrities or anything to do with them.' Giving evidence, Mr Pinney told the panel in London that he did not believe the experienced radiologist’s side of the story. 'The opinion I formed during the interview was that the registrant was lying to me,' he said. Welch, ofTilehurst, Reading, Berkshire, retired after the NHS trust inquiry concluded that he had breached its computer use policies. He wrote a letter to the HCPC panel today saying he had 'no intention of returning to work as a radiographer' and therefore would not be attending to hear if was to be struck off. In her closing statement to the panel, Miss Page said: 'The circumstantial evidence, taken altogether, is persuasive. 'You can see the pattern of searches and the timing of the searches with just seconds or minutes between them. 'The registrant was the only man in the department accessing this computer. 'It’s a generalisation but it is more likely that a man would be searching and looking for these search terms than a woman. 'In this scenario, I would suggest the search terms are inappropriate. They are not medically justified. 'The only reason for these search terms is for personal pleasure or personal gratification. They are sexual in nature and not appropriate.' Miss Page said Welch’s behaviour undermined public confidence in his profession. She added: 'Whilst it may not trouble an ordinary member of the public to find out the registrant was doing this in his own time at home, it clearly damages the reputation of this individual as it was being done on work equipment. 'It clearly raises questions about the registant’s judgement, if nothing else.' The panel retired to consider its judgment this afternoon. It must decide if Welch is guilty of misconduct, and if so whether that impairs him to practice as a radiographer.","Paul Welch allegedly used NHS computer to search for naked pictures .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:14 EST, 25 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:59 EST, 25 September 2013 . Ed Miliband today challenged David Cameron to sign up to TV debates at the next election. The Labour leader told the Prime Minister to 'stop ducking and diving' and agree to repeat the live broadcasts first seen during the 2010 campaign. Mr Miliband ruled out the idea of UKIP leader Nigel Farage being given a place insisting it should be the same format as last time, with Lib Dems, Labour and Tories represented. Challenge: Ed Miliband said David Cameron had to agree to the TV debates so voters can make a choice about who they want to be Prime Minister . Many senior Tories blame the debates in 2010 for Mr Cameron's failure to secure an outright majority. He performed badly in the first encounter, while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg benefited from being comparatively unknown. Conservative strategists feared Mr Farage could enjoy a similar boost in the polls if he was given a platform in the debates. But Mr Miliband made clear it should be a straight battle between the three main party leaders. Speaking during a Q&A session at the Labour party conference, Mr Miliband said: 'It is time for David Cameron to stop ducking and diving to agree to the TV debates just like the last general election, so the country can make its choice.' In 2010 each main broadcaster hosted a debate, including Sky News, ITV and BBC. Rerun: Mr Miliband wants the same format seen in 2010, with the Tory, Lib Dem and Labour leaders going head-to-head . Mr Clegg enjoyed a surge in the polls in the 2010 polls as a relatively unknown figure alongside Mr Cameron and Gordon Brown. Until recently Labour had hoped to capitalise on the rise of UKIP, hoping it would split the centre-right vote and allow them to clinch crucial swing seats. But recent polls suggest UKIP has taken support from all the main parties. Mr Farage has said he is prepared to take legal action to get into televised leaders’ debates if Mr Cameron tries to freeze him out. Challenge: UKIP leader Nigel Farage has threatened to go to court to secure a place on a leaders' TV debate . The Prime Minister has publicly expressed concern that the three debates 'sucked the life' out of the last campaign. He has called for future debates to take place in the months before the May 2015 vote, rather than in the final weeks - a plan that has been privately ridiculed by broadcasters. 'I think TV debates are good. I enjoyed them last time - particularly the last one. We have a fixed-term Parliament now, so we can think about it in a slightly different way,' he said in December. 'I haven’t made my mind up exactly what we should do. My reflection on last time was that they did take all the life out of the campaign. 'The press and all of us were interested in the run-up to the debate, the debate and the post-debate analysis, not the rest of the campaign, which I really enjoy. 'I like campaigning, I like being out there, the public meetings, the awkward moments, the difficulties. 'It is an incredibly exciting time, trying to explain what you are about and what you are trying to do. I found the TV debates took all the life out of it.' Downing Street signalled that Mr Cameron would agree to the debates, but again questioned the format. Aides . pointed out that in January Mr Cameron said: 'I'm in favour of them, I . think they are good and I think we should go on having them, and I will . play my part in trying to make that happen.' A . Number 10 spokesman added: 'As for what format they will take, they are . still quite a long way off and it is yet to be discussed.' Former Tory spin doctor Andy Coulson has warned that the Tories should not pull out, using an article in GQ magazine to tell Mr Cameron: 'Don't be chicken'. He argued that Mr Cameron actually won two of the three debates last time. 'They sealed the deal on the question of him being seen as PM material.' He added: 'It's also nonsense to suggest the debates starved the public of discussion on the big issues. The debate format allowed for more direct exposure to the leaders views.'","Labour leader calls for a rerun of the 2010 format with Tories and Lib Dems .

"By . Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 00:57 EST, 27 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:06 EST, 27 September 2013 . A council has proposed a tough new housing scheme that will prioritise workers, former servicemen and charity volunteers over those who don't make a contribution to society. Under the controversial scheme set to be introduced by Stoke on Trent City Council, prospective tenants who work more than 12 hours a week will move to the top of the pile for social housing. Foster parents' applications will also be fast-tracked as they too are seen as having made a contribution to the community. Tenant Board chairman Jim Gibson, who runs Chell Heath Residents’ Association, said: 'It is important that we look after those who look after us. If someone puts themselves on the front line for their community then we ought to help them when they need our support.' Prospective tenants in Stoke-on-Trent who work more than 12 hours a week will move to the top of the pile for social housing . Under the scheme the council would ditch its three housing bands with five – urgent, high-need with community contribution, high-need, low-need with community contribution and low-need. The scheme is a response to overwhelming demand. Around 6,500 people are seeking 19,000 council houses in Stoke-on-Trent but just 1,600 are typically reallocated every year, reports The Daily Express. Councillor Janine Bridges, ­cabinet member for housing, said: 'We are keen to ensure that those families who are working or volunteering get a chance to rent low-cost accommodation close to their work. 'These aren’t just our views but reflect the views of the local ­community and the plans have been drawn up by our tenants themselves.' Help for heroes: Military personnel will also get priority treatment under the plans . The news comes as it emerged that the long-term unemployed are to be told they must do an unpaid full-time job or be stripped of their benefits. A dramatic extension of the conditions attached to unemployment handouts  will be unveiled at the Conservative party conference next week, according to well-placed sources. Ministers are convinced a new U.S.-style ‘work for the dole’ scheme will help to reduce  Britain’s vast benefits bill and curb the something-for-nothing culture. It is expected that claimants who go through the Government’s main back-to-work scheme, the Work Programme, but fail to find a job, will be required to take part in unpaid community activities or work experience. Those who refuse to do so face losing their welfare payments. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s not acceptable for people to expect to live a life on benefits if they’re able to work.’","Stoke-on-Trent set to prioritise home-seekers who 'contribute to society'

It has long been hailed as the ultimate way to let off steam by some members of the fairer sex. Now, U.S. scientists have discovered that not only does retail therapy exist, but that it could be caused by an individual's fear of sudden death. Researchers found materialistic people find terrorism and war more stressful than others - and are more likely to spend compulsively to help them cope. Psychologists believe the rise of materialism around the world and its therapeutic effect on extreme stress might be a response to fear of death caused by acts of terrorism, disease and natural disasters. U.S. scientists have discovered that not only does retail therapy exist, but that it could be caused by an individual's fear of death. Researchers found materialistic people find terrorism and war more stressful than others and are more likely to spend compulsively to help them cope . The scientists from Michigan State University said people with possession obsessions often have lower self-esteem than others so are more likely splurge in the wake of severe psychological trauma. Ayalla Ruvio, a business professor who studied people's shopping habits while rockets fell in Israel, said: 'When the going gets tough, the materialistic go shopping. 'And this compulsive and impulsive spending is likely to produce even greater stress and lower well-being. Essentially, materialism appears to make bad events even worse.' Dr Ruvio led a two-part study of Israeli citizens living in a town that came under extreme rocket attacks for about six months in 2007. Psychologists believe the rise of materialism around the world and its therapeutic effect on extreme stress might be a response to fear of death caused by acts of terrorism, disease and natural disasters. The aftermath of an airstrike in Gaza is pictured . She compared 139 residents of the southern town with 170 from another town that was not under attack to see how their symptoms of post-traumatic stress and shopping habits varied. Along with researchers from the University of Haifa in Israel and the University of Illinois, Dr Ruvio analysed the psychological condition of the two groups. The psychologists found that, when faced with a mortal threat, those who where highly materialistic suffered much higher levels of post-traumatic stress, while their tendency to buy impulsively and compulsively was increased. Dr Ruvio compared 139 Israeli residents of a town hit by rockets with 170 people from another town that wasn't under attack to see how their symptoms of post-traumatic stress and shopping habits varied. A market in Jerusalem is pictured . Dr Ruvio said: 'The relationship between materialism and stress may be more harmful than commonly thought.' The second stage of their research, which was published in the Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, surveyed 855 Americans about their materialistic nature and fear of death. They found that shopping was used to relieve feelings of stress and anxiety about death among more materialistic people, but this was in response to fear of a variety of life-threatening events like car accidents, criminal attacks and natural disasters.","U.S. scientists found materialistic people find terrorism and .

A police watchdog has decided that tasering a man who then suffered a life-threatening heart attack was justified. James McCarthy, 23, is suing Merseyside Police after he was hit twice with a Taser at a hotel in Liverpool in September last year. His solicitor Sophie Khan said: 'James McCarthy does not accept the findings of the IPCC investigation. He disputes that the Taser use was justified. Warning: Medics told the police watchdog the use of Taser nay have led to a 22-year-old suffering a serious heart attack . 'My client suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of the Taser and sustained a serious injury following the incident. 'Mr McCarthy is now pursuing a civil . claim against Merseyside Police for damages. Mr McCarthy has asked for . his privacy to be respected whilst he recovers for his injury.' Police watchdog the Independent . Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said that use of the stun guns was . justified, but that one of the officers involved should have more . training. Debilitating: The electrified dart fired from the Taser delivered a 50,000-volt shock (Stock picture) The team was called to a Premier Inn . in Albert Dock at around 2.50am on September 30 last year where a group . of men were fighting. Mr McCarthy was hit twice, including by one discharge that lasted 11 seconds, and suffered a cardiac arrest. Tasers are being fired up to five times a day in the UK as police officers rely increasingly on the potentially deadly stun guns. There has been a huge investment in the 50,000-volt weapons in the decade since they were introduced, and police chiefs estimate they are now fired as often as 1,800 times a year. Senior officers are bracing for criticism as use of the stun guns soars. Figures published earlier this month show the number of confrontations involving Tasers more than doubled between 2009 and 2011, from 3,500 to 7,250. There are 14,700 officers trained to use Tasers, after their availability was expanded from highly trained marksmen to specialist units and beat officers. Because of the potential threat of . violence, the IPCC found that using the stun guns was 'proportionate and . appropriate', but that one officer was not aware of how long he was . passing electric current through the Taser and there was a delay in . checking whether Mr McCarthy was OK. The IPCC said that medical staff told . them that the cardiac arrest could have been caused by the Taser, but . that the presence of cocaine and cannabis in his system and raised . adrenaline levels could have contributed. IPCC commissioner James . Dipple-Johnstone said: 'It is a difficult judgment to make in the heat . of an incident, but it is important for public confidence that police . officers are able to account for their decision to use force, including . Taser, and that any force used against the public is at the minimum . level required. 'In this case, officers responded to a . violent situation involving a number of people. 'Our investigation found . they had valid concerns for both their safety and that of the public . and, as such, use of force including Taser was reasonable. 'However, our investigation did . identify areas for improvement in how long the Taser was used for and . how long it took for welfare checks to be made by officers when the . subject of the Taser use was restrained and suffering a medical . emergency.

"PUBLISHED: . 05:44 EST, 27 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:29 EST, 27 September 2013 . A thrill-seeker has become the first person to be fined for 'tombstoning' off a notorious bridge where a 22-year-old died last year. Michael Sharkey, 24, was spotted jumping several times from the 30ft-high Devil’s Bridge in Cumbria. He was fined £170 after admitting breaching a local bylaw, and officers said his prosecution was the first of its kind in the county. It is the same spot where Darrell Teal, 22, of Manchester, died in July last year. Taking action: A court in Cumbria has issued its first fine to a tombstoner who was repeatedly jumping from a bridge where a young man died last year . Devil’s Bridge is notoriously dangerous because there is only a small area of deep water to jump in to from the bridge in Kirkby Lonsdale. The 14th Century bridge has been used for decades by people ‘tombstoning’ into the River Lune, but after several injuries over the years, signs have been erected warning people not to. Fatal spot: It is the same spot where Darrell Teal, 22, of Manchester, died in July last year . Police said that the hot summer this year had led to an increase in people jumping, despite Mr Teal’s death last year. Sharkey, of Gressingham Drive, Lancaster, was fined after pleading guilty at Kendal Magistrates’ Court for the offence. Two other men, both from Rossendale, Lancashire (aged 24 and 33), are also in the process of being prosecuted. Inspector Paul Latham said: 'It is simply crass stupidity to jump from Devil’s Bridge. 'There are a number of risks associated with jumping off a bridge including hitting rocks, misjudging the depth of water and sudden immersion in cold water. 'This prosecution is the first one I am aware of and certainly the first one in relation to Devil’s Bridge. 'We have actually seen an increase in people jumping this year, because of the hot weather.' He said that Sharkey was prosecuted when a local councillor spotted him repeatedly jumping from the bridge in August. The police were called and Sharkey was pointed out to officers. He was issued with a court summons and pleaded guilty to breaching the bylaw. Inspector Latham said: 'There is a problem at the bridge because thrill seekers say that you should be able to do what you want and that the police are being party-poopers. 'But it is very dangerous to jump there. We have to think of the consequences and the impact that jumping has had on the family of the man who died there last year. Devil's Bridge has been a popular tombstoning spot for decades . Taking action: After numerous incidents, the local council put up signs banning people from jumping off the bridge in line with a byelaw . 'This fine shows we do take this . activity very seriously, and work closely with South Lakeland District . Council to tackle the dangers. If someone jumping is reported to us we . will attend and take further action as appropriate. 'However, . the responsibility for keeping each other safe falls on the entire . community. Police cannot be there all the time and we encourage members . of the public to either report anyone seen jumping, or to speak to them . and advise them of the risks in jumping. 'There is also personal responsibility people need to take to protect their own health and safety. It is an incredibly dangerous activity and I would ask anyone who is considering jumping to think about the risks and effects it will have on family should anything untoward happen. The warning hasn't prevented thrill-seekers from continuing to launch themselves from the bridge into the river where they must aim for a small deeper channel . During the hot summer, the adrenaline-pumping past-time has attracted young thrill-seekers and spectators to the river . 'Jumping from the bridge is particularly common during the summer months, and we will continue to work with the local community next summer to reiterate the dangers.' John Barwise, Neighbourhood Enforcement Officer for South Lakeland District Council, said: 'The fine imposed on the male who contravened the SLDC byelaw that prohibits jumping off Devil’s Bridge into the River Lune was a direct result of a joint enforcement operation carried out by SLDC`s Enforcement Team and Cumbria Police during the summer of 2013. 'The prosecution sends out a clear message that SLDC and Cumbria Police will not tolerate the irresponsible actions of members of the public who contravene the byelaw and risk death or serious injury by jumping off the bridge.' Tombstoning is also popular among youngsters in Plymouth . A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police told the Mail Online he was not aware of any fines issued for tombstoning, and officers would advise against it as opposed to prosecute . A spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: 'Jumping from piers, cliffs, rocks or other structures into the sea can be very dangerous. 'What was a deep pool at lunchtime might be a shallow puddle by tea-time due to tidal conditions - and you don't know what other hazards might be under the surface.' In the past eight years, this perilous pursuit has claimed the lives of 20 people and left more than 60 seriously injured, according to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. These figures include two suspected tombstoning incidents last year, where Darrell Teal, 22, died after jumping into the River Lune from the 40ft-high Devil’s Bridge at Kirkby Lonsdale in Cumbria. A few days later 15-year-old Daniel McCullagh drowned after he was swept away by strong currents as him as his friends tombstoned off a 20ft-high bridge over the River Nene at Woodford Lock near Kettering, Northamptonshire. This year there have not been any deaths from tombstoning, but there have so far been three reported injuries to date. In the last eight years there have been 74 reported injuries from tombstoning, according to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. 2007 claimed the most lives to tombstoning within this period, with six people dying doing the sport.","Michael Sharkey, 24, was spotted jumping from the Devil’s Bridge in Cumbria .

Hint: Mayor of London Boris Johnson, pictured today at the opening of Kings Cross Square, has said he wants to return to the Commons . Boris Johnson has hinted that he wants to return to Westminster, amid growing rumours that a Tory MP will be forced out to make way for him. The London Mayor revealed that watching the Commons debate on Syria, which led to a humiliating defeat for his party leader David Cameron, made him pine for the chamber’s green benches. In an interview Mr Johnson said: ‘For the first time in years I wished I was in Parliament.’ Mr Johnson has pledged to serve out his second term as mayor, which concludes in 2016. He previously served as Tory MP for Henley-on-Thames from 2001 to 2008. There is nothing to prevent someone holding the mayoralty and a parliamentary seat at the same time; Mr Johnson’s predecessor Ken Livingstone did so for a year. But allies last night admitted that he has ‘not decided’ whether to run for Parliament again in 2015, allowing him to be in place for a potential Tory leadership election if Mr Cameron were to lose the General Election. ‘He just doesn’t know yet,’ said one source. ‘The only time he’s thought about it recently was over Syria. ‘He’s loving being mayor and he’ll do that until 2016.’ Mr Johnson made the comments in an interview with the Financial Times. His plans are expected to seize the headlines next Monday when he  travels to the Tory Party conference in Manchester for a rally with grassroots supporters. Aides say he will make a ‘highly political’ speech on Tuesday denouncing UKIP and the Labour Party. But his opposition to the High Speed 2 rail line, backed by Mr Cameron, and his support for the immediate building of a new hub airport will put him publicly at odds with the Prime Minister. Rumours that Mr Johnson’s return to Westminster could be imminent were fuelled yesterday when it was confirmed that the executive of the Conservative association in the safe Tory seat of Reigate has refused to confirm the sitting MP Crispin Blunt as the candidate for the next election. Rumours: The executive of the Conservative Association in the safe Tory seat of Reigate refused to confirm if Crispin Blunt MP, pictured, was a candidate in the next election . Mr Blunt, a former prisons minister, offended senior figures in his local party in 2010 when he announced that he had separated from his wife so that he can ‘come to terms with his homosexuality’. Local reports suggest that Reigate officials would like to replace Mr Blunt with Mr Johnson, but the Mayor’s aides deny that he has been in talks. ‘Boris hasn’t been approached. He hasn’t had any talks with them,’ a source said. Mr Blunt will now have to face a full vote of his constituency party to see if he can survive. If Mr Johnson does decide to return to Parliament he will not be short of offers from Tory associations. The Conservatives announced yesterday that they will hold an open primary in Tonbridge and Malling, the Kent seat where veteran Sir John Stanley is standing down. Other MPs are said to be prepared to quit close to the election in 2015 to pave the way for Mr Johnson’s return.

Thieves have taken £1million worth of gold bars from an Air France plane leading to accusations of an inside job. The solid gold ingots were part of a multi-million pound cargo of nine cases containing 300 kilograms of gold. Detectives said that 44 kilos of gold ingots were taken from a plane travelling from the French capital to Zurich last Thursday. They were being handled by the American Brink's secure transportation company, which regularly transfers valuables on the same route. The nine cases set off from Charles de Gaulle airport but only seven cases reached the tarmac on the other side, police said. 'We are investigating the matter, and especially the possibility that this was an inside job,' said an investigating source. The news comes just two weeks after £170million worth of pure cocaine . was found being shipped from South America to Paris on board another Air . France aircraft. The record-breaking 1.3 tonne haul was packed into 30 separate suitcases and all originated in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. All had been registered to passengers who did not exist and were not registered on the flight. Six members of an international drug gang, including three Britons, were arrested following the discovery on September 11th. The other three are Italian and are thought to have connections to the country's infamous Mafia. Three Venezuelan soldiers, a first sergeant, a second sergeant and a first lieutenant, were arrested on Sunday and will be charged, the country's prosecutor's office said. According to Venezuela’s Justice and Interior Minister, Miguel Rodriguez, it is ‘almost certain’ there were accomplices working within Air France. He said: ‘How can the cocaine shipment reach France and it gets taken out without going through the normal controls?’ The news will be embarrassing for Air France whose staff is already facing investigation over a record-breaking £170million haul of cocaine discovered on a flight from Venezuela on September 11th . Record Haul: French Interior minister Manuel Valls talks to journalists in front of cocaine seized by in Nanterre, France . Film from security cameras at the Simon Bolivar International Airport in Caracas were being examined, and staff questioned, he added. None of the suspects have been named to assist police in tracking down other gang members who may go into hiding. Around 900kilos of the cocaine was seized at Charles de Gaulle airport itself, while the remaining 400kg was already in a truck on its way to Luxembourg. Charles de Gaulle airport itself has a notorious reputation for lax security, with baggage regularly stolen. An incredible four tonnes of cocaine has been seized in France since the start of the year – putting the country firmly at the centre of drug routes into Europe. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime considers Britain to be the centre of Europe’s lucrative cocaine market it, and much of it arrives through France.","Police are concerned that the robbery could be an inside job .

A shamed police officer who was dismissed for gross misconduct was found dead on the day he was due to be charged with sex offences. Former PC Gareth Gricks, 53, was found hanged at his home in Dunton, Norfolk, by a family member. Norfolk Police said that he was suspected of being involved in online sex abuse of children in South East Asia, and would use forums to make contact with young girls. He was about to be charged with nine sex offences when he was found dead on 6 August this year, an inquest into his death heard. The charges were three counts of . arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence, one of making . indecent images of children and five counts of sexual assault against a . woman. Gricks is understood to have told his family some details about the investigation a few days earlier. The divorcee, who has adult children, was arrested at his home after returning from a holiday in Thailand in July and was then dismissed from the force for gross misconduct. The child sex offences are thought to relate to victims between the ages of 10 and 16. The sexual assault was committed in the UK. Officers also found more than 100 indecent images on Gricks's computer - though they have confirmed that none of the offences was committed while he was on duty. A death notice published in a regional paper five days after Gricks died described him as 'a dearly-loved dad, granddad, son and brother, . who will be sadly missed by all his family and friends.' He had a profile on a dating website, where he called himself laid-back and romantic. Misconduct: Gareth Gricks was dismissed from Norfolk Police in response to the allegations . It said: 'I work shifts . and have plenty of time off for travelling during the week or weekends, . so don't worry about distance! I am romantic and like to eat out or chill out at home.' Temporary . Assistant Chief Constable Nick Dean said: ‘Norfolk Constabulary took . immediate action on being notified of the officer’s suspected criminal . activity. Norfolk Police . said that he would have had some contact with children during his . duties, but never worked in a role related specifically related to young . offenders or child sex abuse victims in his 20-year policing career. ‘As a result of his death, there can be no criminal prosecution and the investigation, effectively, ceases. ‘However, in recognition of his role and the serious nature of the offences he was due to face, it is right and proper that this information is placed in the public domain, not only to demonstrate police action but also to give victims of sexual abuse a voice when this cannot be achieved through the judicial process.'","Gareth Gricks, 53, was found hanged at his home in Dunton, Norfolk .

So it is no great surprise that Professor Brian Cox should bare a striking resemblance to the natural treasure as he re-created one of his first TV magazine covers. The 45-year-old posed with an armadillo in a mock-up of the Radio Times ‘Zoo Quest’ cover with Sir Attenborough in 1959. Look zoo it is: Professor Brian Cox recreates an iconic Radio Times cover of his broadcasting predecessor Sir David Attenborough . The humorous shoot is part of a series of covers and events to mark the magazine’s forth-coming 90th anniversary. On another cover, Kirsty Young recreates an iconic cover of her broadcasting predecessor Sue Lawley. Speaking at this year’s covers party, 87-year-old Attenborough appointed Professor Cox his successor in a speech. The broadcaster and naturalist whose career has endured for 60 years said: ‘If I had a torch, I would hand it to you.’ Best foot forward: Kirsty Young recreates an iconic Radio Times cover featuring Sue Lawley . Therefore the obvious comparison of ‘then and now’ to celebrate their coming birthday fell in recreating Sir Attenborough’s first photo shoot. Holding 12-year-old armadillo Bruce – loaned to the magazine from a private zoo in Oxford – Professor Cox smiles as he imitates the TV legends 1950s quiff. The two men recently missed each other while visiting Australia on lecture tours. As part of the birthday celebrations the magazine is also running a competition inviting readers to create their own cover photo. Competition entrants will have to download the Blippar app from an Apple store or Google play. After opening the app, entrants – who have until October 15 –should hold their phone or tablet over the cover then take a photo. Animal magic: The shoot was part of the Radio Times' 90th anniversary celebrations . The magazine will feature a selection of the best covers in a future edition, and the editor will select one winner to receive an exclusive invitation to our Covers Party in January 2014. But Sir Attenborough is unlikely to take part. In a recent interview told how he avoids social media and apps because of internet trolls. He said: ‘The worst thing is that on some of these social networks, people actually pretend they’re me and put out false messages. ‘There are at least two sites that say they are me and I have to get a lawyer to get them taken down. On Facebook and twitter there are obscene ones. ‘They’re horrible, rude – sexy rude – god knows why they do it, I don’t. So if anyone wants to know, I do not have any social networking.’ His new series The Rise of Animals: Triumph of the vertebrates is currently winning millions of viewers on BBC2. The first cover of the Radio Times was published September 1923. Earlier this month Sir Attenborough was ranked the second most photographed face of the Radio Times, after the Queen, he has appeared on 20 covers throughout his work in television. Radio Times Editor Ben Preston , said: 'Over the last 90 years Radio Times covers have featured the good and great of British broadcasting reflecting the history of television and radio and the country itself.‘ . Professor Cox, who presented Horizon, is best known for his work on science programmes for the BBC, boosting the popularity of subjects such as astronomy and physics.","Brian Cox poses with an armadillo in a mock-up of a classic cover .

A mother and her three daughters are giving a new meaning to the term Land Girls by taking over the running of a farm following the death of their husband and father. When farmer Michael Besent sadly died from cancer four years ago, his grieving wife Carol, 52, decided to carry on the family business rather than give it up. And while mourning the untimely loss of their father, his three daughters backed their mother’s decision by going to work on the 700 acre mixed arable farm as well. Farm girls: L-R Harriet, 25, Carol, 52, Georgina, 28, and Katy, 21, run the 700 acre mixed arable and dairy family farm in the heart of Dorset . Now the four women are pulling up trees in the largely male-dominated farming community by making a success of the one million pound a year business. Carol runs the farm with middle daughter Harriet, who has a university degree in agricultural studies, and has roped in daughters Georgina, 28, and Katy, 21, for manual labour. The four women are now in one of their busiest times of the year when they bring in the harvest of 250 acres of barley and wheat, a task that requires 14 hour days. Katy operates the combine harvester while Harriet, 25, drives the tractor and trailer alongside it to take the yield of 400 tonnes of barley corn. Success story: The four women are pulling up trees in the largely male-dominated farming community by making a success of the one million pound a year business . Tragic: Carol's husband died four years ago and rather than give up the family farm Carol and her daughters have taken the unusual step of running the 700 acre mixed arable and dairy farm themselves . In charge: Carol runs the farm with middle daughter Harriet, who has a university degree in agricultural studies, and has roped in daughters Georgina, 28, and Katy, 21, for manual labour . Georgina takes charge of milking the herd of 180 dairy cows and although modern machinery extracts the milk, it’s a job that still requires getting up at the crack of dawn. Higher Melcombe Farm, in the village of Ansty, near Dorchester, Dorset, was run by Michael’s father, Peter, who called the business Besent and Sons. The irony of the name has not been lost on Carol who has considered renaming it Besent and Daughters but decided not to in honour of her late husband. Harriet had intended to work on the farm and manage it one day after being taught the ropes by her father but she found herself thrown in at the deep end after he died. Home farm: Harriet, 25, is in charge of the day to day running of the family farm . Milking it: Georgina takes charge of milking the herd of 180 dairy cows and although modern machinery extracts the milk, it's a job that still requires getting up at the crack of dawn . Behind the wheel: Katy operates the combine harvester while Harriet, 25, drives the tractor and trailer alongside it to take the yield of 400 tonnes of barley corn . She said: 'It would have been easy to give the farm up after dad died but that would have meant his life’s work would have just gone. 'Carrying and sometimes struggling on makes us all feel closer to him in some way. 'I hope he would be pleased and proud of what we are doing and keeping the farm in the Besent name.' Mother Carol said: 'There is quite a troop of us. We are all blonde and all females and I think what we are doing has surprised quite a few people. 'Many people have been very supportive and have given us advice but farms aren’t traditionally run by women and some of the traditional farmers see things differently. 'But there aren’t many things that the girls can’t do although sometimes we need a little brawn and we do have a dairyman for that. Loss: Their father was diagnosed with prostate cancer and died in 2009 aged 50. At the time Harriet was about to start her final year at Newcastle University while Katy was doing her A-Levels . Close: The girls say that sarrying and sometimes struggling on makes them all feel closer to their late father in some way . Non-conventional: 'Many people have been very supportive and have given us advice but farms aren't traditionally run by women and some of the traditional farmers see things differently,' they say . 'Delivery drivers often turn up and start addressing the dairyman thinking that he is in charge but it raises a few eyebrows when he tells them they should be talking to Harriet. 'I am sure Michael would be terribly proud of us all, the girls especially. To cope with the death of your father and have to run a 700 acre farm on top of that is an awful lot to deal with.' Michael Besent was aged nine when he moved onto Higher Melcombe Farm with his parents, Peter and Mary. He took over the running of the business with Carol after they married in 1984 and they went on to have their three daughters. But he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and died in 2009 aged 50. At the time Harriet was about to start her final year at Newcastle University while Katy was doing her A-Levels. Home: Michael Besent was aged nine when he moved onto Higher Melcombe Farm with his parents, Peter and Mary and now the girls have taken over . Family: Their father took over the running of the business with Carol after they married in 1984 and they went on to have their three daughters . Carol said: 'Harriet planned to come home and eventually run the farm but unfortunately my husband died too soon and she missed out on being shown the ropes in terms of managing the farm.' Harriet said: 'It is not just our gender that surprises a few people but also our age. 'When I tell people that I am a farmer that don’t take it seriously and think I have a hobby farm with a few ponies.' Georgina has trained to be a schoolteacher and is about to start her first job in teaching but has spent the summer mucking in on the farm. Katy has recently completed a degree in environmental geo-sciences at Bristol University and has returned to the farm to help out. Tough job: 'When I tell people that I am a farmer that don't take it seriously and think I have a hobby farm with a few ponies,' says Carol . Busy: It is a busy time of year because the girls have 250 acres of barley and wheat that needs harvesting . Carol said: 'This is a very busy time of year because we have 250 acres of barley and wheat that needs harvesting and we are an autumn calving farm as well. 'Katy drives the combine harvester and she has to grease it and fuel it as well and Harriet drives the tractor and trailer to take the corn off the combine. 'Harriet is up at 5am and feeds the animals and we then have breakfast and talk about what jobs need doing on the farm that day.'","Carol Besent and her three daughters run their farm in Dorchester .

The meteor that exploded over Russia in February caused a thin stratospheric dust belt that travelled around the world in just four days. NASA satellites made the unprecedented measurements of the meteor which is thought to have released 30 times more energy than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. The meteor fireball measuring 18 meters across and weighing 11,000 metric tons, screamed into Earth's atmosphere at 41,600 mph. Scroll down for videos... Satellite data from Nasa has revealed that that four days after the bolide explosion, the faster, higher portion of the plume (red) had snaked its way entirely around the northern hemisphere and back to Chelyabinsk in Russia . Burning from the friction with Earth's thin air, the space rock exploded 14.5 miles (23.3km) above the Russian town Chelyabinsk. For comparison, the meteor that triggered mass extinctions, including the dinosaurs, measured about 10 kilometres across and released about 1 billion times the energy of the atom bomb. Some of the surviving pieces of the Chelyabinsk bolide fell to the ground. But the explosion also deposited hundreds of tons of dust up in the stratosphere forming a thin but cohesive and persistent dust belt. The meteor fireball, pictured, that crashed into Russia in February was part of a 656-feet wide asteroid called 2011 EO40. Spanish astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor and claim it came from the Apollo asteroid that regularly crosses passed Earth as it orbits the sun . Experts said the meteor that left a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, weighed around 100,000 tonnes and measured 55 feet in diameter . ‘We wanted to know if our satellite could detect the meteor dust,’ said atmospheric physicist Nick Gorkavyi of Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center. ‘Indeed, we saw the formation of a new dust belt in Earth's stratosphere, and achieved the first space-based observation of the long-term evolution of a bolide plume.’ Gorkavyi and colleagues combined a series of satellite measurements with atmospheric models to simulate how the plume from the bolide explosion evolved as the stratospheric jet stream carried it around the Northern Hemisphere. About 3.5 hours after the initial explosion, the Ozone Mapping Profiling Suite on the Nasa-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite detected the plume high in the atmosphere at an altitude of about 25 miles (40 kilometers), moving east at about 190 mph. VIDEO: Nasa tracks the aftermath of the Chelyabinsk meteor explosion . Burning from the friction with Earth's thin air, the space rock exploded 14.5 miles (23.3km) above the Russian town Chelyabinsk . The day after the explosion, the satellite detected the plume continuing its eastward flow in the jet and reaching the Aleutian Islands. Larger, heavier particles began to lose altitude and speed, while their smaller, lighter counterparts stayed aloft and retained speed – consistent with wind speed variations at the different altitudes. Just four days after the explosion, the faster, higher portion of the plume had snaked its way entirely around the Northern Hemisphere and back to Chelyabinsk. At least three months later, a detectable belt of bolide dust was still present around the planet. Spanish astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor that were scattered across the Russian town of Chelyabinsk, where the meteor landed, and claim it came from the large Apollo asteroid that regularly crosses passed Earth as it orbits the sun. They added that the piece may have broken off because of the stress caused by the gravitaional pull of the planets and the sun, or could have been caused by the asteroid hitting into something else during its orbit. Over 1,000 people were injured by the exploding rock and scientists managed to recover more than 50 tiny fragments of the meteor, allowing them to study its contents and origin. As it raced through the sky, the 50-foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it, creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball. Although some debris fell to earth, ‘whipping up a pillar of ice, water and steam’ and creating a 20-foot-wide crater, the damage in nearby towns was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding. The city of Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border, took the brunt of the impact . Local residents said they witnessed burning objects in the sky of the Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk regions . ‘Of course, the Chelyabinsk bolide is much smaller than the “dinosaurs killer,” and this is good,’ said Gorkavyi. ‘We have the unique opportunity to safely study a potentially very dangerous type of event.’ Collectors from around the world will be keen to get hold of a piece of the meteor. Film director Steven Spielberg is a noted collector. In October a 9in piece of the Seymchan meteorite found in Siberia in 1960 sold in New York for $43,750 (£28,200). Astronomers have also revealed that the meteor could have hit UK cities if it had hit at a slightly different time of day.","The meteor created a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake near town of Chelyabinsk .

One user asked for around £6,500 for a small piece, while another offered 18 pieces for £11 each. Locals searching for meteorite fragments have gathered at a frozen lake where a chunk of meteorite hit. One user asked for around £6,500 for a small piece, while another offered 18 pieces for £11 each . Meanwhile, experts say the meteor could have hit a UK city with the force of a nuclear bomb if it had entered the atmosphere at a different time of day. The meteor penetrated Earth's atmosphere at a speed of at least 33,0000mph. As it raced through the sky, the 50-foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it, creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball somewhere between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am local time on Friday. Although some debris fell to earth, ‘whipping up a pillar of ice, water and steam’ and creating a 20-foot-wide crater, the damage in nearby towns was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding. Shockwave: People heading to work in Chelyabinsk, Russia, heard what sounded like an explosion, saw a bright light and then felt a shockwave when a meteor soared across the sky above them . The meteor was undeniably traumatic, but it also brought a sense of co-operation in a troubled region. Large numbers of volunteers came forward to help fix the damage caused by the explosion and many residents came together on the internet. Many joked yesterday about what had happened in the troubled pocket of Russia, with one of the most popular jests: Residents of the meteor were terrified to see Chelyabinsk approaching. Chelyabinsk, nicknamed Tankograd because it produced the famed Soviet T-34 tanks, can be as grim as its backbone heavy industries. In 1957, a waste tank at the Mayak nuclear weapons plant in the Chelyabinsk region exploded, contaminating 9,200 square miles and prompting authorities to evacuate 10,000 nearby residents. It is now Russia's main nuclear waste disposal facility and a vast plant for disposing of chemical weapons lies 50 miles east of the city. The focus of the meteor hunters' efforts was a frozen reservoir outside the nearby town of Chebarkul, where the largest meteorite pieces are thought to have crashed, reports The Sunday Times. Russian authorities stopped a group of locals searching around a hole in the ice as they want people to stay away from the fragments until scientists from Moscow have tested them. Russian authorities also said the search for the meteorite may have to wait until spring when the region's ice and snow thaws. 'The web is awash with people saying they want to buy this stuff,"" said Oleg Karpov, a Chelyabinsk local. 'Maybe this thing was not that bad after all if a few of us make some money out of it.' Collectors from around the world will be keen to get hold of a piece. Film director Steven Spielberg is a noted collector. In October a 9in piece of the Seymchan meteorite found in Siberia in 1960 sold in New York for $43,750 (£28,200). Astronomers have also revealed that the meteor could have hit UK cities if it had hit at a slightly different time of day. Nasa said that when the meteor entered the atmosphere, it exploded with the force of a nuclear weapon. The revelation, based on an analysis of the earth's rotation, comes as scientists reveal that they are planning a state-of-the-art detection system to give warning of incoming asteroids and meteorites, reports the Observer. The announcement of the decision to build the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System, or Atlas, on Hawaii was made following the meteorite crash in Russia. If the meteorite had hit at a different time of day, it could have struck the UK with devastating consequences . Hours after a meteor exploded over Russia and injured more than 1,000 people and an asteroid passed relatively close to Earth, people in California reported seeing an unusual flash of light over the San Francisco Bay area that left many startled and thrilled. Based on reports, the light streaking in the Northern California sky was a sporadic meteor, or fireball, and not a major event, said Mike Hankey, operations manager for the American Meteor Society in Genesee, New York. The group recorded at least 35 reports of the event, he said. 'Fireballs happen every single night, all around the world,' he said. Experts say smaller meteorites hit earth five to 10 times a year but chances of a large meteor passing, such as the one that streaked over Chelyabinsk, Russia, are much rarer.","'Meteor hunters' are out in force as collectors offer large sums .

Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a bill Friday that would fund the federal government through the end of December, but at a cost: the entire Affordable Care Act – Obamacare – would be zeroed out of the budget. The GOP has effectively called the White House's bluff with a 230-189 House vote, setting up a Capitol Hill showdown that the president has said will result in a veto if such legislation should ever reach his desk. Passing a so-called 'continuing resolution' to keep programs funded past the end of September, however, will put Republicans in a position to claim they took measures to avert a government-wide shutdown. It also puts the ball firmly in Senate Republicans' court. Scroll down for video . Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner agreed this week to his caucus' demand to tie defunding Obamacare to any budget vote . All eyes on Ted: Texas Sen. Cruz is seen as the glue holding together any Senate GOP push to force the White House and other Democrats to negotiate . There are just 45 GOP senators, not enough to pass a bill that would defund or delay President Obama's signature health care industry overhaul. But any 41 of them could block the Senate from passing a continuing resolution that's at odds with the House's version. If conservative Republicans in the Senate, like Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, can marshal their forces and hold the line against the 52 Democrats and the handful of independents who caucus with them, a stalemate could force those on the political left to negotiate. Cruz made headlines this week by . declaring that he would do 'everything and anything possible to defund . Obamacare' in the Senate. 'The . House has delivered,' Texas Republican Rep. Kevin Brady announced . Friday. 'Now it's time to fully support our senators as they work to . unite their colleagues behind defunding this terrible health care . takeover.' Hit the road, Jack: Obama has said he will veto any bill that defunds his signature health care overhaul, but his administration may have to negotiate in order to break a Senate logjam . 'It only takes 41 of 45 Senate Republicans to hold the line,' Brady added. 'I believe in Senator Ted Cruz and I’m confident he will prevail. It all comes down to the Senate.' Republicans have taken heat for risking a government shutdown, and the public's mercurial wrath. They have historically shied away from such threats, fearing a repeat of the 1995 shutdown that the public blamed on them. But with the growing unpopularity of Obamacare, all bets are off: Americans could just as easily blame the White House and Senate Democrats for being inflexible. While many in the GOP want Obamacare repealed, others have said they will angle for a one-year delay in its implementation so they can float alternatives and urge the public to rally around them. 'Let's slow down this law,' urged Illinois Rep. Randy Hultgren, 'and look for simpler and smarter healthcare solutions.' A negotiated settlement that lands on that turf would be palatable to wide swaths of the American public, polls show, since the Obama administration has already granted a one-year hiatus to businesses, and granted numerous outright exemptions to favored political groups. The GOP's newfound fervor can be traced to tea party rallies like the September 10 'Exempt America' protest on the west lawn of the Capitol . Pressure: Boehner released a video message on Thursday complaining that Obama will negotiate with the Russian president, but not with Republicans . 'Big Business, Big Labor and even Members of Congress and their staffs are exempt from Obamacare,' observed Jenny Beth Martin, who leads the Tea Party Nation group of far-right conservatives. 'We are asking that the American people be exempted, too.' The White House, through its Office of . Management and Budget, has forecast a bleak future for any funding bill . that reaches the Oval Office without a provision to fund the Obamacare . law. 'The Administration strongly opposes' the House bill, OMB said Thursday, 'because . it advances a narrow ideological agenda that threatens our economy and the . interests of the middle class. The Resolution would defund the Affordable Care . Act, denying millions of hard-working middle class families the security of . affordable health coverage.' Josh Earnest, the White House's principal press deputy, told reporters Friday on Air Force One,  that 'you can expect that the president will have conversations with congressional leaders in the days ahead, but I don’t have any specific meetings to talk to you about right now.'","Senate Democrats face a showdown after House Republicans pass measure funding the entire government until Dec. 31 – except Obamacare .

Films that layer many plots and relationships on top of one another, such as Love Actually, push our brains to breaking point, a new study suggests. Scientists say that 'hyperlink films' such as the Hugh Grant hit as well as grittier titles such as Crash and Babel that follow a number of stories in parallel throughout, require a lot of brain power to understand due to the number of emotional relationships that the viewer needs to keep track of. Hyperlink films reflect patterns that can be seen in social networks, but the number of storylines they can feature is restricted due to the limitations of the human brain. Scientists say that 'hyperlink films' such as Love Actually (pictured) - that follow a number of stories in parallel throughout - require a lot of brain power to understand. This is due to the number of emotional relationships that the viewer needs to keep track of . Hyperlink films, such as Love Actually (pictured) reflect patterns that can be seen in social networks, but the number of storylines they can feature is restricted due to the limitations of the human brain . They use cinematic devices such as flashbacks, interspersing scenes out of chronological order, split screens and voiceovers to squeeze as many storylines into one film as possible, creating complex layered plots. Psycholoist Dr Jaimie Krems of Arizona State University, said: 'Because of our evolved psychology, humans cannot break through the cognitive glass ceiling that naturally limits our ability to handle social relationships, or to understand complex interpersonal dramas.' Films such as Love Actually, Crash or Babel follow similar rules to regular social groups,according to Dr Krems and his colleague Professor Robin Dunbar of Oxford University. Existing work in the field has shown that someone can generally maintain a maximum of 150 friends and acquaintances in a regular social group, which breaks down into four or five in a 'support group', 12 to 15 people in a 'sympathy group' and 30 to 50 people in an 'affinity group' with the rest as acquaintances. For the study published in the journal Human Nature, the team analysed 12 hyperlink films and 10 female interest conventional films and found they all followed rules that can be seen in the real world. Dr Krems and Professor Dunbar found that an average hyperlink film contains 31.4 characters that were central to the plot, similar in size to someone's affinity group in modern society. They also analysed works of Shakespeare which had approximately 28 characters per play, which similarly reflects a less intimate social set-up. Dr Krems believes hyperlink films fail when they try to copy reality but push viewers too far by involving too many characters. This shortfall in our ability to keep up with more relationships than we do in reality means that, despite virtual social networks like Facebook our brains have not evolved to handle so many friends . On the other hand, 'female interest films' had a smaller cast of around 20 relevant characters on average - which is in the range of a conventional sympathy group and reflects female social networks in real life, according to the pair. Dr Krems believes that the hyperlink films copy reality and fail when they try to push viewers too far by involving too many characters. This shortfall in our ability to keep up with more relationships than we do in reality means that, despite virtual social networks like Facebook and Twitter giving us the tools to maintain large social groups, out brains have not evolved to handle them, they claimed. Professor Dunbar said: 'Despite the promise it holds, digital and other new media may not help us engineer social networks or social cohesion on a larger scale, because our minds simply cannot understand or handle the mind states of more than a handful of people at once.' Films such as Babel (pictured) follow similar rules to regular social groups, the researchers said.

An Oklahoma man has been charged with first-degree murder after allegedly killing a man who commented on a picture his girlfriend posted of herself on Facebook. Police say Antwion Courtez Martin, 20, went to the apartment of Edmond James Tyree, 48, on July 17 and shot him dead. He also allegedly shot and wounded Tyree's visiting friend Michael Joe Hale. Five days before his death, Tyree had written 'damm' [sic] on a picture Sharda Perkins, 21, had posted of herself clad in a skimpy swimsuit on her Facebook page, presumably intended as a compliment. Locked up: Antwion Courtez Martin has been charged in the shooting death of Edmond James Tyree . Below Tyree's comment, Martin, whose Facebook moniker is 'Twon Goinsteady Martin' questioned Tyree on the compliment, using an obscenity. On July 17, Tyree was shot dead in his apartment by a gunman and Hale, a disabled Iraq war veteran, was shot and injured. According to NewsOK, Hale said the shooter was accompanied by one or two accomplices, one of whom urged him on, saying, 'What's taking so long? Hurry up and pop a cap in his ass.' Killer body: The photograph Sharda Perkins posted of herself under which Edmond James Tyree wrote the four letters that led to his death . War of words: Unbelievably, police say Tyree's misspelled 'Damn' on Perkins' picture so enraged Martin that he shot him dead five days after the comment was made . Police say Hale was able to positively identify Martin through Facebook while he lay injured in hospital. According to NewsOK, Tyree had shown Hale a picture of Perkins on Facebook and told him that they had 'been together' once but had both agreed it was a mistake. 'He had mentioned to me a couple of weeks prior that they had been together. They both agreed it was a mistake... but everything's cool. They were still friends and left it at that. That's what he told me,' Hale said. Shot at home: Police say Edmond Tyree was shot dead for writing a complimentary Facebook comment about another man's girlfriend . Social network: Police were led to Martin through Tyree's Facebook account - the same way Martin became aware of Tyree . When he looked at Tyree's Facebook page, he noticed that Perkins was one of only a few friends Tyree had on Facebook. When he clicked on Perkins' profile, he saw pictures of her with Martin and recognized him as the shooter. 'It was pure dumb luck that he had his picture on her Facebook page,' Hale told NewOK. Police are still looking for the accomplices in the July 17 shooting. Young couple: Martin will be separated from his girlfriend Perkins for some time if he is convicted of first-degree murder in the shooting death of Edmond James Tyree . According to Perkins' Facebook page, she has been dating Martin since April this year. In a July 25 posting, somewhat ironically above a link about the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin case entitled, 'Do I even have to explain how messed up this is?', she appears to deny her boyfriend's involvement in the crime. 'Ur face n some serious a** charges for some s**t you didn't even do,' she wrote, adding that she believes Martin will be exonerated and that the couple will be back together soon. Martin is charged with first-degree murder and shooting with intent to kill. He remains in Oklahoma County jail.","Police say Antwion Martin shot Edmond Tyree dead for commenting on a picture of his girlfriend .

In an email exchange, Lake Mary, FL Police Chief Steve Bracknell agreed that George Zimmerman is a ‘ticking time bomb.’ Mr Bracknell, head of police where Mr Zimmerman lives, was responding to an angry email from a resident complaining cops aren’t protecting citizens from the increasingly erratic, gun-toting, Stand Your Ground expert. The police chief agreed with the angry citizen’s assessment of Mr Zimmerman. Mr Zimmerman rose into the national consciousness after admitting to killing unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin while on a neighborhood watch patrol. He was found innocent of murder in a dramatic verdict watched live on television by millions. SCROLL DOWN TO READ FULL EMAIL EXCHANGE . A 'ticking time bomb': Locals, as well as police, are clearly concerned with the perceived danger posed to them by George Zimmerman (right) Reacting to the latest incident involving Lake Mary’s most famous resident and his trademark firearm, local resident Santiago Rodriguez emailed Mr Bracknell through a generic contact form on the Lake Mary Police Department’s website. Mr Santiago railed against the department for what he felt was a lack of purpose in the department’s response to Mr Zimmerman allegedly threatening his estranged wife with a gun, smashing her iPad and punching his father-in-law in the face, according to reports. Frustrated: A clearly frustrated Steve Bracknell has vented to both reporters and locals about Mr Zimmerman's propensity for firearms-related incidents . Among the many complaints made to Mr Bucknell about the department, the concerned resident said ‘’Zimmerman is a Sandy Hook, Aurora waiting to happen. Your job is to protect the communities you serve and you are failing big time,’ read the email chain first made public by Think Progress. The embattled police chief responded to the email, surprising Mr Rodriguez. ‘Your reference to Sandy Hook............................. I agree.’ In his second email, Mr Santiago thanked Mr Bracknell for replying, then countered that ‘George is a ticking time bomb… sooner or later another mother and father is going to be on CNN lshing out against the system due to this man snapping.’ The chief again agreed. ‘As for your final thoughts, again, on a personal note, I agree.’ These comments come hot on the heels of Chief Bracknell venting his frustration with Mr Zimmerman to a Los Angeles Times reporter Sept 9. ‘Man, it would be fantastic if you have an apartment out there [in California] for George Zimmerman,’ Bracknell joked to the reporter. ‘This guy is killing me.’ Neither Chief Bracknell, nor a public information officer for the Lake Mary Police Department responded to attempts by MailOnline to reach them. Mr Bracknell did backpedal a bit to ThinkProgress when asked for further comment on his recent remarks. Explaining that he did not agree with Mr Rodriguez, the chief told the site he was ‘referring to the fact that [Zimmerman] seems to be involved in incidents’ involving firearms.’ The Sandy Hook reference is a nod to the December shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown CT., that left 20 innocent children and six adult dead.

Additionally, to help people who have not owned tablets before the new Kindles come with a feature called 'Mayday', which lets users speak to a live customer service representative in a video window when downloading apps or using certain features. The helpers can explain new features or troubleshoot problems while guiding users with on-screen hand scribbles. They can even take control of the device remotely. CEO Jeff Bezos introduced the feature, saying it is 'completely unique' and takes advantage of Amazon's massive cloud computing and customer service infrastructure. It also builds on Amazon's reputation for excellent customer service. This image shows the new 8.9-inch Amazon Kindle HDX tablet, centre, the 7-inch Kindle HDX, left, and an updated Kindle HD, right. The HDX models are four times faster at handling graphics. The new Kindle HD has a magnesium alloy case but has the same processor as older Kindle Fire models . 'You shouldn't have to be afraid of your device,' Bezos said. In a demo, Bezos asked an on-screen customer service representative to recommend an app. The rep suggested Angry Birds: Star Wars II, while also giving instructions on how to set time limits on various activities for children. While the new Kindles are upgraded in several ways, Amazon also cut the price on what will be its entry-level, updated 7-inch tablet, the Kindle Fire HD with 8GB of memory now costing $139 in the U.S. The new Kindle Fire HD has a magnesium alloy body, like the HDX models, but has the same screen resolution and processing power of the older models. Stephen Baker, a consumer technology analyst with research firm NPD Group, said the price cut to the Kindle Fire HD will do more to help Amazon compete in the tablet market than the added features on the newer models. In the U.S, the 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HDX, pictured, starts at $379 for 8GB memory. The 7-inch model starts at $229, also for 8GB. Prices and release dates for the UK have not yet been announced . 'That's where that model needs to be priced,' Baker said, explaining that there are numerous manufacturers with tablets with screens that measure seven inches diagonally, all priced around the same mark. 'A big focus in that 7-inch category is just price.' Between May and July, Kindles accounted for 17 per cent of all tablets sold in the U.S. compared to 48 per cent for Apple's iPad and 8 per cent for Samsung's Galaxy line, according to NPD. Globally, Amazon's shipments between April and June were down 59 per cent from a year earlier, at 470,000. Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, pictured, poses with the 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HDX at an event in Seattle . This is compared to 14.6 million for Apple's iPad, down 17 percent from a year ago, and 10.8 million for Samsung's Galaxy line, up 539 per cent. Amazon sells most of its Kindles around the Christmas holidays, Baker said. Beyond the improved specifications, Amazon also unveiled more features that incorporate data from its IMDb movie database partner. With the newer tablets, users who turn on the 'X-ray' feature can see a small window that lists the name of a song that is playing in some TV shows and movies. One tap brings up the option to buy the song. Users can also look for all music in a show and zip to the exact spot where a particular song is playing. People who have set up Amazon's video player as an app on their TVs or through game consoles can also follow along in real-time on their tablets, getting information on actors and trivia related to the shows on their larger screen. Music lovers can see song lyrics when they play songs bought from Amazon, lyrics are highlighted as they are sung and tapping on the lyrics will zip to the appropriate point in the song. Bezos said these services are only possible because Amazon provides the hardware, operating system, applications, cloud infrastructure and services for the devices. The 'hardest and coolest' services such as its Mayday service lie at the intersection of 'customer delight' and 'deep integration through the entire stack,' he added. Amazon also unveiled new 'origami covers' that lie flat when closed over the screen but can be folded and snapped into place as a stand that works both in horizontal and vertical position. They'll come in seven different colours in the U.S for between $45 and $70.","Amazon's Kindle Fire HDX tablets come in 7-inch and 8.9-inch versions .

Early humans were able to hunt animals as large as a prehistoric elephant, according to fossils found at an ancient butchery site in Kent. Dr Francis Wenban-Smith discovered the remains of an extinct straight-tusked elephant along with a number of flint tools dating back 420,000 years ago in Ebbsfleet. It is thought the elephant, which was twice the size of today’s African variety, died after being hunted for its meat. Dr Francis Wenban-Smith discovered the remains of an extinct straight-tusked elephant along with a number of flint tools dating back 420,000 years ago in Ebbsfleet, Kent . The discovery was made during the construction of the High Speed 1 rail link from the Channel Tunnel to London in 2003. ‘My first thought was ""Oh no, how do we tell the High Speed 1 team that there is more archaeology to be dealt with?""’, Dr Wenban-Smith of Southampton University told MailOnline. ‘The Eureka moment for me was finding a flint core in amongst the elephant's rib cage - this confirmed the human association with the elephant. I was ecstatic.’ Researchers believe the deposits date to a warm period around 420,000 years ago, called Hoxnian interglacial. Since the excavation, Dr Wenban-Smith (pictured) has been carrying out a detailed analysis of evidence recovered from the site, including a number of flint tools found . It is thought the elephant, which was twice the size of today's African variety and up to four times the weight of family car, died after being hunted for its meat . How skilled early humans were in hunting is still a matter of hot debate, according to Southampton University’s Dr Francs Wenban-Smith. Prior to the discovery of these flint tools, evidence was largely based on clues about the age and sex of body parts of possible prey animals. ‘In this case, we infer the Ebbsfleet Elephant was hunted because the half-dozen Stone Age elephant butchery sites known from Europe are mostly prime adult males, and we do not think these would most often have died naturally,’ said Dr Francs Wenban-Smith. Since the excavation, Dr Wenban-Smith has been carrying out a detailed analysis of evidence recovered from the site. These include 80 undisturbed flint artefacts found scattered around the elephant carcass and used to butcher it. ‘Although there is no direct evidence of how this particular animal met its end, the discovery of flint tools close to the carcass confirm butchery for its meat, probably by a group of at least four individuals,’ said Dr Wenban-Smith. ‘The finding is massively important for our understanding of what early hominins were doing, and how they were able to colonise new terrain. ‘It's so rare to find undisturbed remains of any sort from this period. This new evidence confirms the importance of elephant in their diet.' Although it seems incredible that they could have killed such an animal, Dr Wenban Smith claims it must have been possible with wooden spears . Researchers believe the deposits date to a warm period around 420,000 years ago, called Hoxnian interglacial . ‘We know hominins of this period had these, and an elephant skeleton with a wooden spear through its ribs was found at the site of Lehringen in Germany in 1948,’ he said. These early humans suffered local extinction in Northern Europe during the great ice age known as the Anglian glaciation 450,000 years ago, but re-established themselves as the climate grew warmer again in the following Hoxnian interglacial. An ability to hunt large mammals, and in particular elephants, as suggested by the Ebbsfleet find, would go some way to explaining how these people then managed to push northwards again into what is now Britain. The flint artefacts of these pioneer settlers are of a characteristic type known as Clactonian, mostly comprising simple razor-sharp flakes that would have been ideal for cutting meat, sometimes with notches on them that would have helped cut through the tougher animal hide. ‘The discovery of flint tools close to the carcass confirm butchery for its meat, probably by a group of at least four individuals,’ said Dr Wenban-Smith (pictured) of Southampton University . The discovery of this previously undisturbed elephant grave site is unique in Britain – where only a handful of other elephant skeletons have been found and none of which have produced similar evidence of human exploitation. Dr Wenban-Smith explained the Ebbsfleet area would have been very different from today: ‘Rich fossilised remains surrounding the elephant skeleton, including pollen, snails and a wide variety of vertebrates, provide a remarkable record of the climate and environment the early humans inhabited. ‘Analysis of these deposits show they lived at a time of peak interglacial warmth, when the Ebbsfleet Valley was a lush, densely wooded tributary of the Thames, containing a quiet, almost stagnant swamp.‘ .","Discovery was made during the construction of HS1 rail link in 2003 .

A quick-witted ranger captured the macabre but comic scene, which saw both animals suffer some discomfort but survive. A greedy toad found deep in the Peruvian rainforest tried to swallow a hapless bat whole but only succeeded in making itself look like a bizarre mutant animal as it failed to eat its super-sized meal. A quick-witted ranger captured the comic scene, which saw both animals suffer some discomfort but survive . The cane toad is a large, terrestrial amphibian that is native to Central and South America, but has been introduced to various islands throughout Oceania and the Caribbean. The cane toad is a prolific breeder - females lay single-clump spawns with thousands of eggs. Its reproductive success is partly because of opportunistic feeding as the toad has a diet of both dead and living matter. Adults average 10 to 15 cm in length but the largest recorded specimen weighed 2.65 kg  and measured 38 cm long. The cane toad is an old species and a fossil toad dating from the late Miocene of Colombia is indistinguishable from modern cane toads from northern South America. The species has poison glands and the tadpoles are highly toxic to most animals if ingested. The cane toad is now considered a pest and an invasive species in some of the regions it was introduced into as a method of pest control. Park ranger Yufani Olaya spotted the strange behaviour in the Cerros de Amotape national park, the Rainforest Expeditions blog reported. He said the cane toad was sitting on the ground with its mouth open as it optimistically waited for its lunch to appear and seemed to get lucky as a low-flying bat entered its area. Experts believe bats fly close to the ground despite the rick of predators to pick up insects and Mr Olaya said the bat passed incredibly close to the toad, almost flying into its mouth. The toad reportedly snatched at the bat, but it is not clear whether this was a refex action or a deliberate move to snare a large dinner. Whatever the case, the creature clamped its powerful jaws around the furry critter, cramming it into its mouth. The photograph captures the toad's discomfort as it battles to swallow the mammal whole, despite the bat's wings and tail sticking out of its mouth. It is not clear if the cane toad (like the one pictured) deliberately lunged at the bat or expected its meal to be slightly smaller, but the creature reportedly clamped its powerful jaws around the furry critter, cramming it into its mouth . Adam Leaché, assistant professor of herpetology at the University of Washington, told NBC News: 'Toads are voracious and will eat pretty much anything that moves and can fit in their mouth.' However, he said he had not seen another toad attempt the same move before. While the creatures can swallow large beetles and centipedes with ease, the bat was either too large or too furry for the hungry amphibian as it spat out its dinner. Charles Linkem, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington, explained that as cane toads do not have teeth, the animal tried to crush and swallow the bat. A happy ending: Despite almost becoming dinner, the bat escaped unscathed and flew away quickly after its incarceration in the toad's mouth. A short-tailed fruit bat that lives in the Peruvian rainforest is pictured . He told NBC News: 'The bat was a little big for that. The . toad may have tried to reposition its mouth to swallow and that was when . the bat was able to escape.' Amazingly, despite the ordeal the bat escaped unscathed and flew away quickly after its incarceration. The amphibians are known to eat almost anything, which perhaps accounts why they have invaded so many habitats. Dr Linkem said: 'It could be this population of toads have . developed a strategy for feeding on low flying bats and that this is . more common, but never observed before now.'","A ranger captured the moment a cane toad attacked an airborne bat in the Peruvian rainforest .

Athletes such as Usain Bolt (pictured) have distinct genetic codes that give them their explosive and sustained fitness, according to a new study . Scientists have discovered a certain genetic characteristic, or genotype, is more common in power athletes like sprinters than in normal people and even endurance athletes. Usain Bolt and Mo Farah have distinct genetic codes that give them their explosive and sustained fitness, according to a new study. Polish researchers found the variety of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene is two to three times more common in elite power athletes than nonathletic people. The adjustment to the AGT gene may alter how the renin-angiotensin system performs, changing the way blood pressure, body salt, and fluid balance are regulated in the body. But scientists think the characteristic might give the likes of Bolt a boost by increasing the production of a hormone called angiotensin II, which is crucial for muscle performance. Genetic tests on Polish international elite power and endurance athletes who had competed in World and European Championships, World Cups, or Olympic Games as well as  non athletes, were carried out by Dr Ciszczyk of University of Szczecin in Poland. Overall, 100 power-oriented athletes, including sprinters, jumpers and power lifters as well as 123 endurance athletes, such as long-distance runners, swimmers and rowers were tested, while 344 non-athletes were studied for comparison. They found the adjustment to the AGT gene was found in 40 per cent of power athletes, compared 18 per cent of non-athletes, while it was found in just 13 per cent of the endurance athletes. However, results published in Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research showed there was no real difference between the higher and the lower ranks of elite power athletes who had the gene. 100 power-oriented athletes, including sprinters like Mo Farah (pictured right), plus 123 endurance athletes and 344 non-athletes were studied for comparison. Scientists found the adjustment to the AGT gene was found in 40 per cent of power athletes, compared 18 per cent of non-athletes . The scientists pointed out that while the characteristic was nearly three time more common among the power athletes than endurance athletes, the exact effect the gene had on strength and performance was yet to be determined. Pinpointing the exact genes that make people stronger or faster will have implications for all sports and their elite competitors in the future, according to Dr Ciszczyk. She said: 'Identifying genetic characteristics related to athletic excellence or individual predisposition to types of sports with different demands (power or endurance oriented) or even sport specialty may be decisive in recognizing athletic talent, and probably will allow for greater specificity in steering of sports training programs.'","Polish scientists found Usain Bolt and Mo Farah have distinct genetic codes that give them their explosive and sustained fitness .

With remarkably smooth harmonies, Blais explains the tricky concept of string theory to the tune of Queen's most famous song . The ‘Bohemian Gravity’ video doesn’t mess around. Right from the start he poses the ultimate questions, ‘Is string theory real? Is it just fantasy?’ An Einstein sock puppet joins the chorus to help explain string theory how string theory could solve one of the biggest mysteries of the universe; how gravity and quantum physics work fit together.

At its most basic level, string theory, also known as the ‘theory of . everything,’ proposes that all objects in our universe are composed of . vibrating filaments (strings) and membranes of energy. The theory . suggests that each so-called fundamental particle contains a tiny, . vibrating, one-dimensional loop of string.  The vibration of the string . determines the charge and mass of the greater particle. String theory . works in ten or eleven dimensions and we only experience four. Scientists have theorised that the missing dimensions are curled up into . a compact space.  If the space is tiny, on the scale of the strings, . then we would be unable to detect them. Or as, Timothy Blais put its, . ‘to get down to 4D we compactify. Oh, Kahler! Manifolds must be Kahler! If we wanna preserve, any of our super-symmetry.’ Scientists are . hopeful that string theory will solve one of the biggest mysteries of . the universe; how gravity and quantum physics work fit together. 23-year-old Blais has completed his master's degree at McGill University in Montreal, Canada with a  thesis titled ‘A new quantisation condition for parity-violating three-dimensional gravity.’ He recently told his Twitter followed that he was putting his studies on hold for a while to focus on his music career. ‘I've been in school all my life so I'm switching gears and being a musician this year!’ he said. ‘Bohemian Gravity’ isn’t Blais’ first foray into music. Last year, the fresh-faced student recorded ‘Rolling in the Higgs,’ a scientific riff on Adele’s song. According to Blais’ Facebook page, these ‘science-parody creations are 100 per cent originally recorded and made out of unaltered sounds from his mouth, throat and vocal cords.’ The video became popular at CERN, the Geneva research facility where the Higgs Boson particle - which underpins the accepted standard model of the universe - was found. At the time, Blais told AFP: 'I'm kind of amazed by the feedback. ‘One student from Spain told me his supervisor called my video: ""The only good thing to come out of the Higgs discovery so far"".

Sorely missed: Dan Stevens as Matthew Crawley and Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary Crawley are now parted forever . Downton Abbey’s Lady Mary is in deep mourning. She spends her days in her bedroom, dressed in black or purple, staring at a framed photograph of her late husband, Matthew, on the dressing table. ‘Anyone who tries to lift me out of it has an almost impossible task on their hands,’ says Michelle Dockery, who plays the recently widowed Lady Mary — and new mother of baby George — in the fourth series, which returns this weekend. ‘Lady Mary has gone back to being as unapproachable as she was in the first series, but for a different reason,’ says Michelle. ‘Then, she was a very petulant, spoilt . aristocrat, but over the years — and especially since she had known . Matthew — she softened. But now, in her grief, she has put the barriers . back up again.’ The last . time we saw the great house standing proudly on its manicured lawns, in a . Christmas Day special, dark clouds were descending. Dashing . young Matthew was killed when his open-top sports car crashed, just . after the birth of George, heir to the family’s estate. The . new series begins six months after Matthew’s death in 1922, with Lady . Mary still consumed by grief and wondering whether she will make a good . mother and be able to bond with her fatherless son. Even . a consoling visit from the family’s trusted butler, Carson, cannot . shake Lady Mary out of her depression. Can Tom Branson, the wilful . former chauffeur and widower of her sister Lady Sybil, be the one person . who can bring happiness back into her life again? ‘Although it’s a dark period in Mary’s life, I do enjoy playing that side of her, when she’s got more of a sting in her tail,’ says Michelle, 31. Bonding over their grief: Michelle as Lady Mary with son George and Allen as Tom Branson with baby Sybbie . As you will see, she’s even quite brutal with Carson (Jim Carter), whom she had always turned to for guidance. ‘She’s also very dismissive of caring Anna Bates [Joanne Froggatt], the head housemaid. She hurts people who want to help her.’ The . death of Matthew (Dan Stevens) shocked millions of viewers. It had been . a well-kept secret, although Stevens had for some time been signalling . his intention to leave Downton and try his luck in Hollywood. Darker drama: Michelle Dockery's Lady Mary is struggling to escape her grief in season four - and even Michelle felt her loss . ‘We’d . all signed up initially for three series of Downton, so the time was . right for him to make his move,’ says Michelle. ‘Any of us could have . made the same choice. ‘Of . course, I would have loved Dan to have stayed, but there does come a . point where you have to make decisions about your career and what you . want to do. ‘I was worried . at first because without Dan the story had to change. His character was . not only my husband, but the hopes for the family’s estate were pinned . on him. ‘It means that this . new series has had to take a real turn, something Julian Fellowes [the . Oscar-winning writer] hadn’t bargained for.’ When Stevens first said that he wanted to leave at the end of series three, Fellowes urged him to wait until a convenient moment arose in an early episode in series four. Then he would write him out by sending Matthew on a business trip to America, which would still leave the role open to him to return should things not work out later. He even offered to film some scenes in  New York. But Stevens was determined to move on, so Fellowes reluctantly had Matthew make a dramatic exit in a fatal car crash — but not until the very end of the Christmas episode, so that viewers wouldn’t be as upset as they would be if it had happened mid-way through the show. ‘I’m not mourning Dan like Lady Mary is for her husband,’ says Michelle, ‘but I do miss him. We had become close and it has seemed strange without him. ‘It’s the same with Jessica Brown Findlay, who played my sister Lady Sybil, who died soon after bearing her baby daughter. ‘We all spent so much time together, and suddenly they are not there. Mary feels isolated in her grief — and I’m missing two good friends.’ Grieving: Both Lady Mary and Michelle suffers after the death of Dan Stevens' Matthew . Servant support: Lady Mary turns on all her helpers, even her own maid Anna Bates . In loving memory: Lady Mary struggles to bond with her son George following the death of Matthew and passes him on to a wetnurse . So what is the future for Lady Mary? It’s clear, from the opening sequence of the new series, that it’s likely to be a long time before she will receive gentlemen suitors. Says Michelle: ‘Mary is nowhere near ready. I don’t think it would be right for her to move on that swiftly — and the viewers wouldn’t like it, either. So you’ll have to see. It’s going to be a while.’ However, the gossip from the set is that there are admirers on the horizon. As Fellowes says: ‘A lot of men will be interested in a beautiful, clever, well-connected woman with a big estate. Women like that have a lot of pursuers.’ Although she forms an alliance-through-grief with her brother-in-law Tom Branson (Allen Leech), it is likely that their partnership will be more to do with fulfilling Matthew’s plans for modernising the estate, as well as sharing the problems of being single parents. ‘We are kindred spirits, but I am her rock, because her world has collapsed around her,’ says Leech. ‘That’s all there is to it.’ One hotly-tipped candidate for Lady Mary’s eventual affections is Lord Anthony Gillingham, an old family friend she’s known since they were children, played by 28-year-old Welsh actor Tom Cullen. Another is the aristocratic Charles Blake, a role taken by Foyle’s War actor Julian Ovenden, and there is also speculation that Lady Mary shows a keen interest in Chicago jazz singer Jack Ross, played by Gary Carr. ‘I’m giving no clues,’ says Michelle Dockery. ‘But all I will say is that although at the start of the series we see Lady Mary reverting to being a glamorous ice princess, it will take a special man to make her melt.’ Downton Abbey, ITV, Sunday 9pm.","New series opens with Lady Mary's crippling grief after Matthew's death .

An investigation into public Wi-Fi networks has found 51 per cent of free hotspots in the UK let users access adult and explicit content. The research, carried out by mobile security firm AdaptiveMobile, tested the web filters on public networks across the country and discovered one in three UK cafes and restaurants have no filtering in place at all - leaving children in danger of accessing pornography. A further 20 per cent of food establishment similarly failed to stop customers from visiting sex dating sites such as AdultFriendFinder.com. An investigation by mobile security firm AdaptiveMobile into public Wi-Fi networks has found 51 per cent of free hotspots in the UK let users access adult and explicit content. The research also discovered one in three UK cafes and restaurants have no filtering in place at all, leaving children in danger or accessing pornography . Technology magazine PC Pro recently tested 15 of the most popular web filters used in homes and discovered only three blocked 100 per cent of porn. The investigations included free and paid-for services. It also tested each filter using pro-anorexia, pro-suicide, gore and gambling sites, as well as sites classed as containing 'hate' or 'tasteless humour'. More than 150 sites were used, yet not a single package blocked every instance of explicit, adult or inappropriate content. Norton Family was the best performing filter, while MetaCert was the worst. Mystery shoppers in London, Manchester and Birmingham attempted to access inappropriate content including pornography, drug- and violence-related sites. The investigation found over half (53 per cent) of cafes and restaurants do not have any restrictions in place to block online stores selling knives and swords. While four out of five (80 per cent) also granted full access to drug-related content such as ILoveCocaine.com. 'For every parent across the UK this report will come as an unwelcome surprise,' said Graeme Coffey, vice president product strategy and business development at AdaptiveMobile. 'In the last two years there have been two convergent trends: a big increase in public Wi-Fi and greater access to smartphones, gaming consoles and tablets with a Wi-Fi capability, the kind of device a child could have. 'Most people will instinctively block adult content when it comes to filtering, but what these results show is that we should also be looking at content related to drugs and violence which are just as harmful but frequently overlooked.' The report examined web filters across cafes, restaurants, hotels, retailers and public spaces. Hotels scored the worst with 74 per cent not blocking pornography. Government-owned public spaces such as train stations had the strongest filters with more than 90 per cent of them restricting access to pornography . The report examined web filters across cafes, restaurants, hotels, retailers and public spaces. Hotels scored the worst out of the five categories, with three out of four (74 per cent) not blocking pornography and only one in ten actively blocking online weapons shops. During a similar investigation in the U.S, researchers found 72 per cent of American cafes and restaurants have no restrictions on access to pornography - more than double the UK. 'Having filters in public spaces is just as important as other restrictions such as the smoking ban and modesty covers on adult magazines,' says Andy Phippen, Professor of Social Responsibility in IT, Plymouth Business School. 'The fact that this protection isn't available in a significant proportion of publicly accessible sites will undoubtedly cause concern. 'However, we should also reflect on . the effectiveness of some of those in place - simply having a filter . doesn't necessarily mean everything is protected. 'These . results should encourage public outlets across the UK to review the . Wi-Fi services that they have in place and ensure that they are fit for . purpose and appropriate for their customers.' Government-owned property and public spaces, such as train stations, had the strongest filters. More . than 90 per cent of government sites restricted access to pornography, . although one in three granted full access to online weapons stores. Research was carried out during September 2013 across 179 locations in Birmingham, Manchester and London in the UK and 86 locations in Boston, New York and San Francisco in the U.S. Research staff visited cafes, restaurants, retail outlets, hotels and public spaces and attempted to log onto various websites. These sites include Pornhub.com (Pornography), Adultfriendfinder.com (Adult dating), Budk.com (Knife purchases) and Ilovecocaine.com (Drugs). Each website was scored using an 'accessibility matrix' created in partnership with Andy Phippen, Professor at the University of Plymouth. It recorded any measures that prevented staff from logging onto websites, including the need for personal details, credit card numbers or branded warnings from the cafe, hotel and so on. All research staff were over 18 at the time of the research and consented to be part of the project. Similarly, Sky-owned The Cloud automatically filters adult content at hotspots in public places. The Cloud is used in more than 20,000 hotspots, including Greggs, PizzaExpress, JD Wetherspoon and Caffe Nero and applies the filter by default. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'We believe that parents want peace of mind that their children cannot inadvertently access adult material when out of home. 'That’s why we were the first WiFi provider to apply content filters as default across our entire network.' Coffey added: 'Cafes, restaurants, hotels and administrators of public spaces should talk to their ISP and other bodies to understand the most appropriate filtering methods for their premises.' 'Whilst hotels are predominantly private places, where a ‘no filtering’ policy may be appropriate, hotel lobbies, cafes and restaurants are more public and the content policy should reflect this. 'It is certainly neither a simple nor a ‘one size fits all’ matter, and the community should work together to understand the issues and put a suitable policy in place.'","One in three UK cafes and restaurant have no filtering in place at all .

An eight-year-old Brazilian boy showed he intends to live life in the fast lane after deciding to head out on one of the busiest motorways in Rio de Janeiro... on his tricycle. The unnamed youngster was filmed careering down the Elevado Paulo de Frontin expressway which runs through downtown Rio, on his three-wheeler.. As the boy speeds down the slope of the two-lane carriageway into Avenida Presidente Vargas with his legs splayed out either side of the trike cars zoom past him on the outside lane. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO: . Dicing with death: Fearless boy punches the air as he rides alongside cars . Freewheeling: The boy, said to be from a local slum, kicked his legs out and sped down the hill of the busy motorway . In the incredible clip, filmed on Friday, the youngster starts off at the top of a slope and gathers speed by pushing off with his left leg then jumping on the tricycle. The stunt looks like it could go disastrously wrong for a moment when the toy-rider wobbles precariously around for a few seconds as he tries to gain control. Luckily, the road is unusually quiet as he gains composure and the fearless boy even takes the time to remove his right shoe before it falls off. As he veers precariously into the middle of the road, several cars come around the bend. Risky: The Elevado Paulo de Frontin expressway is one of the busiest roads in Rio . Toy rider: The boy seems completely unfazed as he sets off on his death defying ride . Totally unfazed, the boy looks around at the stunned driver he is sharing the road with. He even pretends to change gears by twisting the handlebars and hunches over as if revving his make-believe engine. Despite being one bump in the road away from certain peril, the fearless junior even has the audacity to give the alarmed motorists a thumbs up before grabbing the handlebars again. Hard shoulder: At one point the boy is almost forced onto the central wall of the busy highway . Pit stop: The junior joy rider stops close to the edge of the lane before rejoining the road for a second time . During his dangerous venture onto the carriageway, no driver stops to help the boy who is on a notoriously busy stretch of road. The bypass is also riddled with security cameras operated by Rio city council, but they were oblivious to the incident until a local TV station showed them the footage. As the boy reaches this the end of his ride he lifts his arms in celebration as if having triumphed in a grand prix, but his moment of glory is abruptly brought to an end by a motorist who blasts their horn at the pint sized daredevil. Rider in red: The boy is said to be known to authorities in Rio as a local trouble causer . Final lap: He eventually calls it a day after being narrowly missed by a number of speeding cars . Not satisfied with the one lap, to the astonishment of surrounding drivers, the youngster then drags his bike from the hard shoulder and gets back into the inside lane for another go. This time he hugs the side of the road and that may have saved his life as a grey car speeds round the bend, just yards behind the boy. Fortunately, the driver spots the tricycle up ahead and swerves into the outside lane to avoid a collision. No fear: The boy insisted he was not scared when reporters caught up with him after his stunt . A local TV reporter who filmed the escapade gave the boy a post race interview when they found him a few minutes later sitting on his trusty tricycle. 'Weren’t you scared?' asks the reporter. 'No' says the child with a complete air of innocence. Although they were not shown in the video, the boy was accompanied by two older brothers who had also participated in the dangerous motorway game. A reporter tracked down the family of five to a nearby run down property. The mother, father and three children were said by neighbours to be living in a one bedroom space. The premises which has home walls inside, dividing the area up into separate dwellings, houses a total of twenty families. It’s situated close to the motorway and opposite the Rio City hall building in the centre.  Each family pays 300 reais, around £83.00, in rent per month. On Friday afternoon, journalists found the mother but she declined to comment. By yesterday, the family had disappeared as the authorities, who had been alerted to the incident, turned up to take the children into care. Rio city council revealed the brood was already known to social services and the children had been taken into care before following previous concerns raised about their welfare. The city's municipal guards, who are responsible for road safety, issued a statement this week apologising for their failure to respond appropriately to the incident on Friday. They said: 'Nobody reported the incident to us, so we were unaware of what was happening. If we had known we would have closed the road down immediately to ensure the safety of the public and the child'.","Boy, 8, dices with death by riding down one of the Rio's busiest roads .

A pioneering, minimally-invasive fat reduction procedure promises to leave you sculpted and slim - with no scarring. Microcannula tumescent liposuction - dubbed MicroLipo - is performed under local anaesthetic using tiny steel tubes which can measure less than a millimetre. The size of the wound left means any scars will fade until they are almost invisible. MicroLipo involves a diluted local anaesthesia being injected into areas, and then removing fat with tiny tubes . Cannula sizes range from 0.9mm to 3mm, much smaller than those used for traditional - and Vaser - liposuction. Their small size makes them particularly good for targeting smaller body areas such . as bingo wings, chin, inner thighs, flanks, abdomen and chest. One of the latest bodyshaping treatments, MicroLipo removes unwanted fat and sculpts targeted areas of the body to provide for better definition, and can remove . up to 3.5 litres of fat in total. Traditional liposuction, with larger . cannulas, removes fat relatively quickly, which . increases the risk of irregularities and depressions in the skin. The . use of microcannulas, on the other hand, allows smoother and more . uniform results. MicroLipo is the brainchild of US-based . Dr. Jeffrey Klein. There is currently just one surgeon qualified to perform the operation in Europe, Dr Gupta of The Private Clinic on Harley Street, London. He has performed well over 1,500 MicroLipo procedures in his time. There's a problem area on many . women's bodies that nobody talks about. It's not unsightly, not bumpy, . not lumpy - and not visible. But . the painful friction caused by rubbing inner thighs is the bane of many women's lives - mine included. The affliction has burdened me ever since I can . remember. Even as a . size eight teenager, my slight knock-knees and upper inner thigh fat . meant I suffered painful rubbing and, until now, I chose to accept that as . my lifelong fate. No matter how much I exercised or dieted, the hot, raw thigh rub would not cease. Minimally invasive MicroLipo changed my thighs: Before (l) and after (r) I . spent summers in clear tights and jeans when all I wanted was to go . bare-legged or wear shorts. I even discovered Charnos no-toes tights which . allowed me to wear sandals. I own countless pairs and wore them . religiously all summer. But . last week, for the first time ever, I allowed myself a day in a dress . with bare legs. And, while my thighs grazed very slightly, there was no . friction. I was pain and carefree all day. I couldn't stop smiling - . and I still can't now. 'Lipo traffic as a whole is up 32 per cent year on year in the UK. This includes laser lipolysis, Vaser, and non surgical lipo effectively. 'Vaser lipo is actually down 5 per cent year on year - there has been quite a marked drop in traffic over the last four months in particular. 'Surgical lipo traffic is up 47 per cent year on year.' Stats by healthcare search engine WhatClinic.com . The idea of being battered and bruised on an operating table terrifies me, so it was the words 'no scars' and 'minimally invasive' that sold me on MicroLipo. After . my initial consultation with Dr Gupta, he said he could take a litre of . fat out of each leg. This figure seemed high to me, so I asked him to . take less if he could, and to focus on just the chubby bit at the top. He stressed that to achieve a finessed and natural look, the whole upper . inner thigh would need sculpting - from knee to groin. I accepted his . expert opinion. On the . day of the procedure I was given several sedative pills and taken into . the operating room where my legs were marked with a blue pen. Dr Gupta injected each thigh with a lot of local . anaesthetic solution making them swell and firm. This helps separate the fat cells from the other surrounding tissue and minimises blood loss. Fat . removal then commenced via about ten entry points on each leg. I could feel something in my leg, but no pain. It was strange, but not as strange as I . thought it would be. He removed up to 800ml of fat from each thigh. Four . hours after I entered the building, wrapped in dressings and trussed up in post-operative garments, I was in a cab on my way home. The operation took four hours from entering the building to getting a taxi home . I had taken the week off and went to my mother's the next morning. I was close to immobile for this time and hobbled for the next couple of weeks after that - so I will say you can't go straight back to work. Also, I was in post-operative garments and dressings meaning I couldn't wear normal clothes. During the recovery time, my thighs looked irregular. They were bruised, hard and lumpy and I worried about the final result. Dr Gupta recommended special post-lipo lymphatic massage and two sessions worked wonders in speeding up recovery. While downtime was more intense and longer than I imagined, it's now been six weeks and the swelling is almost completely gone. I can hardly see any marks or evidence I ever had anything done and my thighs are almost even and totally soft and smooth. The benefits of Dr Gupta's insistence on working from knee to groin are evident to me now. My leg shape is a lot straighter and, more importantly, it all looks entirely natural. At just 23, some might say I am too young . to make the decision to under the knife. But to me, all it means is . that I get to live more of my life in comfort. 'As long as the patient is fit and . well then there is no reason why someone who is in their twenties cannot . recover from the procedure just as quickly as a person in their forties . or fifties,' says Dr Gupta. Explaining my mild discomfort at times, Dr Gupta continues: 'A patient . who is slightly older may find the procedure and recovery process . slightly easier as their skin is likely to be slightly slacker and . looser. However this is not always the case; every patient is . different.' The price of MicroLipo on the inner thigh isn't as terrifying as one might think. It all depends on the amount of fat and areas requiring treatment. The cost of the procedure I went for is just at the beginning of the threshold - much less than I would have assumed. Since . deciding to go ahead with the operation I have spoken more openly . about the affliction I found awkward for so long. I am only a size . 10 to 12 and painful chafing was, in my mind, reserved for heavier . frames. But to my surprise - and relief - many shared . my concerns. I recently went for a massage and told my therapist about my operation. She, a size 10 herself, had suffered painful inner thigh chafing her whole life - she calls it 'nappy . rash'. The big, warm hug she gave me after I . wrote down my surgeon's number for her told me that we need to . talk about this more. There are things we can do to improve the situation, be . it rocking 90s revival flouro cycling shorts under our dresses, no-toes . tights - or even a spot of MicroLipo. MicroLipo costs from £2,600.

One of Britain's poshest social housing projects is being rented to wealthy holidaymakers because it is too expensive for tenants desperate for somewhere to live. The £200,000 apartment, in a Georgian block in the heart of Bath, is now let to tourists for £700 per week despite 3,500 people being on the city council's housing waiting list. This fully-furnished, one-bedroom property, is also available at £450 for a three-night stay, and has already received rave reviews online. Welcome to paradise: This apartment at Sydney Place in Bath is being let as a holiday apartment by social housing giants Curo . Financial plan: A social housing giant has caused controversy after launching a programme to rent their properties to tourists . Change of plan: Curo decided to start a pilot scheme letting houses out as holiday homes after it was decided they were unaffordable and unsuitable for usual tenants . The company that owns it, Curo, admits that the flat was once used for social housing but would not say when it was refurbished. In an apparent UK first, the firm has launched the scheme after deciding some of their properties were unaffordable and unsuitable for potential tenants. Victor da Cunha, chief executive of Curo, said the scheme was designed to make the most out of the 12,000 properties the company owns across the West Country. He said: 'Bath's status as a top city break destination has enabled Curo to explore whether using a small number of our properties as holiday lets we can generate income to re-invest in building much-needed, modern and affordable homes for local people. 'If this project is successful it will mean we can avoid selling properties which would otherwise not be viable for Curo to retain.' Trial: Bosses are testing the new scheme with a Georgian flat which costs holidaymakers up to £700 per stay . Beautiful: This perfectly manicured garden was originally meant for social housing tenants but the business running them has decided against renting it to them . Mr. da Cunha added that the layout of . the ground-floor flat and cost of heating it all year round made it . impractical for tenants on low incomes. The . property is equipped with a TV and DVD player, wi-fi, iPod docking . station, fitted kitchen, private garden and its own parking space. The . flat has already had its first guests and has received a four-star Gold . Standard by Quality in Tourism, the assessment service for Visit . England. Room with a view: It overlooks one of Bath's . most exclusive streets and with its luxury bathroom it has to be one of . the glitziest social home ever . Dramatic: The apartment is in the heart of Bath, widely considered on of Britain's most beautiful cities because of its Georgian architecture built from local stone . Speaking on the . Bath Holiday Rental site, Edward, who was the first visitor to stay in . the apartment said: 'It's a beautifully decorated period apartment which . I found completely relaxing and equipped with every conceivable modern . appliance to make my life easy. 'The . position in Bath is perfect; walking down Great Pulteney Street to the . city centre is like being in the middle of the most beautiful film set. 'Great to be the first Guest ever to use it!' Curo hope if the pilot is successful they will be able to use more of their homes as holiday lets.","The apartment in the heart of Bath is available for £700 per week or £450 for three nights .

Texting a lot and sleep deprivation are directly linked in young adults, according to new research. Researchers suspect the reasons behind the link could include feeling . pressured to respond . immediately to texts, no matter what time of day or night, and sleeping . with the phone nearby, thus being awakened by the alerts from . incoming texts. The new study by Washington and Lee University psychology professor Karla Murdock found that frequent text messaging was also associated with . greater psychological vulnerability to interpersonal stress. The study examined links among interpersonal stress, text-messaging behavior, and health . In an article in the latest edition of . Psychology of Popular Media Culture, Murdock reported that texting was a . direct predictor of sleep problems among first year University . students. The study examined links among interpersonal stress, . text-messaging behavior, and three indicators of college students' health: burnout, sleep problems and emotional well-being, reports Science Daily. To assess students' sleep quality, . Murdock used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index with minor modifications . to fit the college sample. The widely-used instrument measures multiple aspects of sleep quality such as sleep duration, the . amount of time it takes to fall asleep, the amount of time actually . spent sleeping while in bed, nighttime disturbances, and daytime . sleepiness. 'These correlational . findings provide an initial indication that heavy text messaging could . be problematic during times of stress,' writes Murdock. 'Although speculative, it could be . argued that text messaging is a uniquely unsuitable mode of . communication for coping with interpersonal stress in close . relationships.' She suggests that the abbreviated language that is common in . texting lacks the ability to provide the kind of . nuance that is important in discussing sensitive issues. In addition, . texting fails to offer critical non-verbal cues that would be part of a . face-to-face conversation. Researchers say texting is an unsuitable mode of communication for coping with stress in close relationships . 'Text . messaging may carry a high risk of producing or maintaining . misunderstandings and/or unproductive interactions during periods of . stress,' she writes. 'When interpersonal stress involves conflict, the . conditions required for productive communication may be particularly . difficult to achieve through texting.' Researchers found the impact of texting . on psychological wellbeing depended on the level of interpersonal stress . partiicpants were already facing. But more texting was associated with . poorer sleep regardless of their previous stress levels. The students in the study, all in their first year, answered questions that measured academic and social burnout, emotional well-being and sleep problems. Murdock also asked them to estimate how many text messages they send and receive on an average day. The study's findings on sleep were especially significant given the well-documented compromises in sleep that students experience throughout college, but especially in the first year. Several recent studies have shown that 70 percent of college students receive less than the eight recommended hours of sleep. A 2007 survey by the American College Health Association concluded that 40 percent of students feel rested only two days a week. The key finding was that a higher number of daily texts was associated with more sleep problems. Murdock notes that this finding reinforces previous evidence pointing to a direct association between cell-phone use and poor sleep in adolescents and emerging adults.","University students who texted a lot suffered more sleep deprivation .

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have always been trend-setters, even more so since the birth of Prince George. But one phenomenon they might not be pleased to be associated with is a recent spate of dog thefts. Thefts of stolen black cocker spaniels, which resemble the couple's dog Lupo, have reportedly increased dramatically since the newest Royal canine was thrust into the spotlight. Trend-setter: Lupo, right, was adopted by William and Kate, and featured prominently in this family portrait, showing newborn Prince George . A professional pet detective has said he is investigating a record number of stolen Lupo lookalikes, which he suspects have been taken by criminal gangs looking to cash in on the breed's popularity. We are currently looking for 13 and have . recovered five in the past 12 months,' Colin Butcher, director of the Pet . Detectives agency, told the Daily Telegraph. 'They . are the tip of the iceberg, as a lot of people probably don’t realise . that their dog has been stolen. Many may think they have been run over . or just gone astray.' 'It is not travellers or thieves . that are for the most part responsible, but organised gangs who have . people who want these dogs.' Royal's best friend: Lupo is often seen out and about with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Although demand for particular breeds of dog can fluctuate drastically according to the fashion of the day, respectable breeders often do not wish to meet the new demand, which can lead to people trying to acquire the dogs illegally. Figures released in January this year suggested that the number of reported dog thefts had rocketed by 17 per cent to more than 3,500 a year. The biggest increase was said to be in black cocker spaniels after it was revealed that William and Kate adopted Lupo in December 2011, which can now sell for up to £1,000. In April this year a black cocker spaniel which looked just like Lupo was stolen from a farm in Surrey. Jodie Ferrier, who bought lookalike Fern for the three-year-old son, is convinced a breeder snatched her dog so she could produce more puppies. Police investigated the theft of the dog, which was microchipped, but were unable to find the animal. The . Kennel Club, which vets dog breeders in the UK, said that general interest in cocker spaniel puppies had increased 9 per cent since Lupo was introduced to the world, while the number of puppies being born each year - around 23,000 - had remained the same. Since he joined the family, Lupo - whose name was kept secret until he was three months old - has been a regular fixture of Royal life, and appeared prominently in the first official photograph of newborn Prince George. Kate was often spotted walking Lupo around Angelsey, where she lived while William was serving as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot until earlier this month. The duchess - whom a friend said was 'besotted' by Lupo - received the dog as an early Christmas present from her parents after he was bred from their family pet.","Royal couple got cocker spaniel Lupo in December 2011 .

Downing Street was forced to deny that Mr Cameron's decision to attend this evening ran counter to his pledge. The spokesman added: 'The Prime Minister has always been clear about the importance of transparency, which is why this Government has taken  a number of steps in terms of publishing more data, more information and making details of meetings available. 'We publish far more information on meetings than previous governments. The Prime Minister regularly has meetings with key ministers from other countries and with business people and others as part of his job. 'That doesn't mean that he is not determined to lead the most transparent government.'

Since its inception in 1954, Bilderberg  has held annual gatherings of 120-150 invited political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media, designed to 'foster dialogue between Europe and North America'. The group describes the conference as 'a forum for informal, off-the-record discussions about megatrends and the major issues facing the world' and states that the private nature of the meeting allows participants to 'listen, reflect and gather insights' without being bound by the conventions of office or by pre-agreed public positions.

It is cheaper to buy a home than rent one with buyers £900 a year better off, a study has revealed . The research found the average monthly mortgage payment has risen to £672 while rents have gone up to £745 over the same period. Buying is now 10 per cent cheaper than renting, according to the report by Halifax, the UK's biggest lender. But young people are still struggling to find deposits. For sale and to rent: Buyers are better off by an average of £900 a year than those who rent according to a study by Halifax . The turnaround has been caused by two factors - falling house prices and low mortgage rates, which have been pushed even lower by the government's flagship Funding for Lending scheme to kick-start the housing market. The average mortgage rate for a new borrower has dropped from 5.88 per cent in June 2008 to 3.57 per cent by June this year. Average house prices, despite a strong recovery in the past three years, remains 13 per cent below prices in 2008. Rents have risen because of strong demand by young people, many of whom cannot afford to buy their first home in the tough economy.

Martin Ellis, economist at Halifax, . said the findings suggested it was a 'no-brainer' to buy for those who . could afford the deposit. He . said: 'We understand that building a deposit is still a key challenge . for those looking to get on the ladder but if they can get over that . hurdle, it's cheaper now to buy,' The study - based on a three-bedroom house - took into account typical costs like income lost by finding a deposit rather than saving, household maintenance and repair and insurance costs. People living in London and Northern Ireland have the most to gain from buying, the research suggested, while the gap between the two is biggest in Northern Ireland, around 11 per cent. Looking for a home: Saving for a deposit is the biggest hurdle for couples who have to rent . Buying in Northern Ireland costs an average £369 a month, while renting is £415. Londoners do best from getting on the first rung of the property ladder, with a saving of almost £100 a month. Wales and Yorkshire and the Humber were the only areas of the UK where renting was found to be more affordable than buying. In Scotland, buying was £27 a month cheaper than renting. Halifax findings reveal the average age of a first-time buyer is now 30, up from 29 in 2011, with parents helping couples save the deposits. Mr Ellis told the Daily Telegraph:' 'A combination of lower mortgage rates and declining house prices has substantially reduced the cost of buying over the past six years. 'Nevertheless, the number of home buyers in the twelve months to June 2013 was nearly half of that in 2008, which will have been constrained by worries over job security.'","Halifax study reveals buying a property is 10 per cent cheaper than renting .

An exclusive coastal resort in Dorset has become so popular with Russian millionaires that a local estate agent has set up a branch in Moscow. Until now, rich buyers from the former communist country have tended to snap up luxurious properties in central London. But the exclusive seaside resort of Sandbanks in Poole, Dorset, is fast becoming a property hotspot for wealthy Russians. To meet the demand, one Sandbanks estate agent has set up an office off Moscow's Red Square.They have also printed 10,000 glossy sales brochures in Russian to be distributed there. Appealing to foreign buyers: Lloyds Property Group has opened a Moscow branch to handle the increasing number of wealthy Russians looking to buy property in Sandbanks, Dorset . Going all out: Lloyds has also produced 10,000 glossy sales brochures in Russian which will be distributed at its new office in Moscow . And at their office on Poole Harbour, Lloyds Property Group have employed a Russian-speaking member of staff to handle inquiries from the former Soviet Union. Sandbanks is a sandy peninsula that measures just half a square mile yet has more than £80million worth of property currently up for sale. It already has its own Russian oligarch - billionaire Maxim Demin who moved in after buying a 50 per cent share of Bournemouth's football club in 2011. The famous Russian singer Valeriya, who has sold more than one million albums, has been seen house-hunting in the area as well. Tom Doyle, managing director of Lloyds, said: 'There is definitely a market for Russians, there's no question about it. Sandbanks: The peninsula of half a square mile of golden sand, near Poole in Dorset, has been described as the fourth most expensive place to live in the world . Sandbanks Yacht Company: These three 4,000 sq ft waterfront houses are being marketed for £4.25million each. They have five bedrooms with en-suites and balconies with frameless glass balustrades . Harbour Watch: This £7.45million property has a seven-car underground garage, a digital cinema system and six bedrooms . 'Normally areas like the South of France and Dubai are popular with Russian buyers, but England is seen as a safe place for them and it's all about selling the dream. 'We are trying to encourage Russian people to move a bit further south than just London or St Georges Hill in Surrey. 'Most of our magazines in Russia are online but we have also shipped around 10,000 over there. They are also in hotels out there like the Ritz-Carlton. 'We have opened an office in Moscow and now have a Russian desk in Poole and already there has been an awful lot of interest, which has been growing for around five years. 'Sandbanks is a great location and ticks all the boxes for the Russians, they like boats for example, and you have Poole Harbour on the doorstep. Des res: Sanbanks, which boasts stunning sea views, has become one of the most sought after and expensive areas of real estate in the world . Flag House: This Arts & Crafts-style house, which still has its original decorative cornicing and herringbone woodblock floors, went on the market at £4.75million . Harbour Edge: This property used to be a fifties-style bungalow, which was bought by John Lennon in 1965 for £25,000 for his Aunt Mimi . 'Areas like the Cote d'Azur are very popular places for them to visit and the area has some fantastic beaches, we have our own Cote d'Azur in Dorset. 'Sandbanks also has some lovely architectural style on the waterfront properties and some wacky houses too, and its those sorts of trophy homes the Russians look for.'

But it would appear that no matter how much they throw their wealth at estate agents in London, their millions aren't getting them much in these days of soaring house prices. Estate agents are reporting that homes costing between £50million and £200million are extremely rare - despite people's willingness to part with huge sums of cash. Homes for the super rich are few and far between, as the capital's house prices soar . David Adams, managing director of luxury estate agent John Taylor, said that the pool of mansions that both met clients' demands and were within their budget had considerably shrunk, the Guardian reported. Investment firm London Central Portfolio claims there have only been nine properties sold for more than £20m in London this year. However, these figures exclude those properties bought in the name of a company, a technique used by many overseas buyers, the Guardian reported. As the London property market booms, the capital has been turned inside out over . the past decade because the highly-paid are now choosing the gritty . inner-city over once-affluent leafy suburbs. All change: This map from property experts show . how areas of London have gone upmarket, in red, and downmarket, in blue, . in the past decade based on the earnings and professions who live there . A . map compiled by housing experts shows that the 21st century capital has . gone through 'reverse gentrification' at a dramatic pace. Based . on the professions and salaries of those living there, the red areas . show places that have gone 'upmarket' and communities that have gone . 'downmarket' since 2001.

It reveals the . end of the trend where those who could not afford areas like Kensington, . Chelsea, Islington and other salubrious areas of Central London headed . to the outer edges of the city. The capital saw rises of almost 10 per cent in July, but prices fell in Scotland, Wales and the north of England. London's house prices are now double those in many areas, and rising faster . The latest House Price Index showed values in England have now exceeded the peak in January 2008. But it is almost entirely fuelled by a sharp rise in prices in London and the South East. The Office for National Statistics said that UK house prices in July were 3.3 per cent higher than in 2012, up from a 3.1 per cent rise in June. But when London and the South East are removed, prices are only up 0.8 per cent. This surge in price has prompted fears . Last week, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) suggested that a 5 per cent cap should be placed on annual house price growth to stop any future house price bubble and borrowers taking on too much debt for fear of missing out on a boom. 'House price growth remains stable across most of the UK, although prices in London are increasing faster than the UK average,' the ONS said. 'The year-on-year increase reflected growth of 3.7 per cent in England and 1.8 per cent in Northern Ireland, offset by falls of 2 per cent in Scotland and 0.7 per cent in Wales.'","Only nine properties sold for more than £20m in London this year .

One of the childhood homes rapper Eminem lived in in one of the many impoverished areas of Detroit is up for sale - and there are calls for the 8 Mile star to invest in his old 'hood and buy it himself. The home, at 19946 Dresden, was featured on the cover of his 2000 album, the Marshall Mathers LP, and is located just south of 8 Mile Road on Detroit's east side. The house currently is vacant, and is little more than a boarded-up, 767-square-foot shack. The minimum bid for the property currently stands at $1. Blight: The home - like many around it - currently is vacant and run down . Famous 'hood: Eminem used the home as the backdrop for his 2000 album cover, The Marshall Mathers LP . According to the Detroit Free Press, the metal porch roof and downspout are missing, and the fake stone facade is stained. The house is one of more than 11,000 vacant properties in Detroit owned by the Michigan Land Bank, a state-run agency that manages vacant properties in some of the city's most decaying neighborhoods. Eminem's mother bought the property in 1987 for $19,000 in an agreement that required who to pay the couple who owned it $3,000 upfront and $220 a month. Ms. Mather's was issued a deed for the house in 1994, and turned it over to Ann Investment the same day. According to the paper, 'the property changed hands about 10 times before the Wayne County .

"By . Oliver Wadeson . PUBLISHED: . 17:55 EST, 21 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:14 EST, 22 September 2013 . They call them iceberg homes because so much is hidden beneath the surface – and they are proving VERY controversial. In London, where property prices keep rising and space is  at a premium, ever more people are deciding to expand their homes downwards, creating vast basements – and in may cases a great deal of upset among the neighbours. Tetra Pak heir Hans Rausing is one of the latest members of the capital’s super-rich  to join the iceberg trend, planning a double basement complete with underground pool, car park and gym. Buried treasures: The modest exterior of the extended £5.95million mews house which hides a 1,130sq ft. basement extension . Those living close to such developments often complain of the noise and vibration created – and object to the road closures frequently required while excavated material is removed form the site. There are also concerns about the effect that digging so deep can have on the water table. Ersin Sirer is one of those who has successfully navigated the problems of creating an iceberg home, recently completing a basement extension in a mews house in South Kensington, West London, that is now for sale for £5.95 million. Ersin, 50, has long-standing links with the area. Besides his work as a property developer, he owns Chelsea breakfast haunt The Chelsea Bun, where celebrities such as Kylie Minogue, Minnie Driver, Sienna Miller  and Bob Geldof are regularly seen sipping coffee. In fact, his family have been well known around South Kensington ever since his father, Resat, launched the Bosphorus Kebab Inn on Old Brompton Road in 1973. This was the first kebab house to open in the capital outside the Turkish community in North London and is still there today, under the same ownership, keeping late-night revellers’ appetites satisfied. Deeply luxurious: A lounge in the West London property which also boasts four bedrooms, a media room and a wine cellar . Ersin, who is married with  a two-year-old daughter, can’t be charged with running roughshod over his neighbours’ concerns when he developed his iceberg home, despite the fact he dug 23ft down to create two underground storeys comprising 1,130 sq ft. When he made the planning application for the development, the only objection he received was from a neighbour who wasn’t concerned by the subterranean digging – she just insisted the garage wasn’t used as a living area, which he was happy to comply with. Ersin says his application was helped by the fact that another nearby resident had recently carried out a major basement development. The development did not come cheap. He . spent £35,000 on simply renting two parking spaces at the rear of the . house for vehicles to remove the excavated matter from under the house. Ersin, 50, works as aproperty developer and owns the famous breakfast haunt The Chelsea Bun . On top of that, he had to seal the basement storeys with a silicon . membrane and fit a pump to deal with excess levels of water rising from . beneath the house. ‘I could . have gone down further,’ says  Ersin, ‘as I encountered fewer problems . than other developers building basement extensions – largely because it . is a mews house with direct access to roads on either side, which is . very rare.’ Ersin, who bought the house from an offshore company that had used it as a rental property, spent a large sum on the renovation, but the result of digging two new storeys is that a modest mews house has been transformed into a modern palace. ‘The main challenge was getting . natural light in all the storeys,’ he says. ‘This was helped by the fact . that there are windows on both sides and I have created an open-plan . effect with skylights and glass partitions throughout, which means . sunlight reaches the bottom floor. ‘I like square rooms and the overall feel of the property is warm, cosy yet chic.’ The . house now has four bedrooms, three with en suite bathrooms. There is . also a shower room and a utility room and an abundance of entertaining . space – a ground-floor reception, a dining room, a further reception . room, and a media room with bar and wine cellar on the lower basement, . plus a large garage. Simon Rose, of selling agents Strutt and Parker, believes the underground development will make the house attractive to a range of potential buyers. ‘What is extraordinary about this house is that it offers a true alternative to the typical townhouse style,’ says Rose. He says the house is finished to a luxury standard and believes that the probable buyer is already looking or living in the Knightsbridge, Belgravia or Mayfair areas. ‘Properties with such width are rare, and this mews in particular is positioned in a very quiet and discreet position and would suit buyers looking for good security and discretion. This particular package is very hard to find in South Kensington.’ Whoever buys the house, regulars at the Chelsea Bun can be reassured that Ersin has no plans to allow his property developing sideline to take him away from in his catering work – thus ensuring that a great tradition that began with his kebab-selling father in the 1970s continues. www.struttandparker.com .","Ersin Sirer, owner of The Chelsea Bun cafe, is selling his £5.95m home .

With its dingy carpeting, water-stained wooden shingles and tired decor, this clapboard house in the struggling former timber town of Aberdeen, Washington, would usually fetch around $67,000. But because it is the former home of troubled Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, who committed suicide nearly 20 years ago, 1210 East 1st Street is going on the market this week for $500,000. The house, which is being sold by Cobain's mother, Wendy O'Connor, still has the rock legend's graffiti on the walls, and his bedroom carpet, curtains and even the mattress that aspiring young musician slept on. Scroll down for video . The house, which Cobain's parents bought when he was two, lies in the former timber town of Aberdeen, WA . A young Cobain and his sister Kimberly are pictured sitting in front of the fireplace that still remains at the house . Cozy: The bungalow's decor is just the same as it was when Cobain was growing up there in the 1970s . The tired 1.5-story bungalow two-hours southwest of Seattle lies a short walk from a riverfront park dedicated to Cobain's memory, and the family is open to offers from anyone interested in turning it into a museum. To help sell the property, the family is offering a glimpse into the early life of its tortured and talented son through photos shot at the house, including one of a chocolate-frosted birthday cake for Kurt and a shot of a teenage Cobain smiling, guitar in hand, in his messy room. His room still has the stencil-like band names - Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin - he reportedly put on the walls, as well as the holes he put in them. 'We've decided to sell the home to create a legacy for Kurt, and yes, there are some mixed feelings since we have all loved the home and it carries so many great memories,' Cobain's sister, Kim Cobain, said. 'But our family has moved on from Washington, and feel it's time to let go of the home.' The Cobains bought the house, a 1923 structure with a recent coat of yellow paint, in 1969 when Kurt was two. He lived there until his parents separated when he was nine, and again with his mother during his later teen years. Unchanged: The young Kurt's attic bedroom still bears the names of bands he stencilled onto the walls . Kitchen: No fan of haute cuisine, one of Kurt's favorite foods was Kraft-brand Macaroni and Cheese . Celebration: This picture supplied by the singer's family shows his excitement as his sixth birthday cake . The heroin-addicted Cobain committed suicide in Seattle in 1994 when he was 27, after a meteoric career that popularised the Pacific Northwest's heavy, muddy 'grunge' rock. The last of Nirvana's three studio albums, 'In Utero,' came out in September 1993, and Universal Music Group has released a re-mastered version and a box set. Cobain described his early childhood in Aberdeen as happy. He would ride his bike around the small yard and even off the roof of the little yellow house, and practise on a set of Mickey Mouse drums his parents bought him.

This photograph shows the dining room table that was used by the Cobain family in Kurt's childhood . Behind the house is the garage where a rat once ran over Kurt's foot when his father was trying to kill it . In one event that entered family lore, Cobain's father, Don, trapped a rat in a garbage can in the garage. Don tried to spear it with a broomstick, but the rodent clambered up the handle, over Don's shoulder to the ground and across Kurt's toes to safety, which five-year-old Kurt found hilarious. But his parents' divorce scarred him deeply. At one point, he scrawled 'I hate Mom, I hate Dad' on his bedroom wall, Cobain's biographer Charles. R. Cross wrote. 'It's a place where he had very fond memories, but it's the house where his parents got divorced,' Cross said in an interview. 'He couldn't wait to get away, but it's a place that helped shape who he became.' History: Dann Sears from the Aberdeen Museum Of History stands in the Cobain's tiny garage .

British Gas broke into the home of Stephanie MacDonald-Walker, pictured, to cut off her gas supply even though her property didn't have one . British Gas has been forced to apologise to a businesswoman after the company broke into her home to switch off a gas supply that didn't even exist. Stephanie MacDonald-Walker was stunned when she came home to find a worker from the energy giant had forced his way into her flat in an attempt to fit a pre-payment meter. The fashion boutique owner moved into the property in Stoneygate, Leicester, four months ago, and received a letter addressed to a previous occupier claiming there was an unpaid gas bill of £367. She called British Gas to say there was no gas supply at her home - and was told not to worry as there must have been a mistake. But when Ms Macdonald-Walker returned from running her boutique in Leicester last week, she found a card left by British Gas which stated: 'We entered your home with a warrant to either fit a pay-as-you-go meter or disconnect your gas/electricity supply.' The company has now apologised and blamed a 'wrong meter reference' for the blunder. But Ms Macdonald-Walker described the actions of the company as 'disgraceful'. She said: 'I can't believe what they have done. 'I told them I had no gas supply at my flat so the unpaid bill had absolutely nothing to do with me. 'Despite all this information, they chose to break into my home while I was out at work. 'They left a note in my apartment explaining they had entered but couldn't find the gas to turn off and would I call them immediately. 'Their behaviour has been disgraceful. They did not listen to me at all. If they had done, none of this would have happened.' Ms Macdonald-Walker told how she called British Gas to set up an account for electricity after moving in and paid her first bill on time after reading her own meter. She added: 'In August, I got a letter addressed to the occupier of my flat saying there was an outstanding gas bill of £367. 'I called the British Gas helpline immediately and told them it was not my bill and there was no gas supply at my flat. 'The woman on the end of the phone said it must have been a mistake and told me not to worry about it. Ms Macdonald-Walker said she forgot about the letter until she came home from work on September 17 to find a note from British Gas informing her that they had entered her home. The note: British gas left this note at the home of Stephanie MacDonald-Walker after the broke in to turn off a gas supply she'd already informed them her flat didn't have . She added: 'I got home at about 6pm to find a card in my house from someone saying they were from British Gas and they had entered my property. 'There was a small hole in the door and neighbours told me a locksmith came to gain access. It sent a shiver down my spine to know someone had been into my flat. Under the Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954 an official of a gas or electricity company can enter a private residence in certain situations and under certain conditions. They can enter a home if a magistrate has given the official a warrant authorising them to enter to either inspect, substitute, remove or to re-install a meter, to alter or repair supply lines or pipes and other fittings or to disconnect the supply. In order to obtain a warrant, the official must show that the homeowner has been given at least twenty-four hours' notice, has already refused the energy company representative admission to the property, or that the building is unoccupied. Entry must be at a reasonable time and the official must leave the house as secure against trespassers as it was when he or she arrived. 'Apart from anything else, my neighbours must have seen them forcing their way into my flat with me not there. 'What must they think of me? I am self-employed businesswoman and this happened through no fault of my own. 'I now feel paranoid about being in this flat. I cannot exaggerate just how badly this has affected me and how strongly I feel about the way British Gas has behaved.' Under the Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954, energy operators can obtain a warrant from a magistrate giving them permission to enter a person's home in certain circumstances. British Gas said it applied to the courts for a warrant to enter Ms Macdonald-Walker's flat 'in error' as it held the wrong meter reference for her home. Spokeswoman Leonie Edwards said: 'I am very sorry we entered Ms MacDonald-Walker's flat in error. 'As soon as we entered her property and saw there was no meter, we left and secured her home.

Well now you can as long as you have very deep pockets. The birthplace of iconic British sports car maker Aston Martin has been put on the market for a cool £2.5 million. Number 16 Henniker Mews is a three-bedroom property tucked away in a posh part of Chelsea. History: The oldest existing Aston Martin A3 and the newest V12 Vanquish outside the birthplace of the classic British marque, which is on the market for £2.5 million . Apart from the plaque on the door there is little sign that this is where one of the world's most iconic motoring brands was born . And on January 15, 1913, it was the base for business buddies Robert Bamford and Lionel Martin. The engineers formed Bamford & Martin Ltd and used the property’s garage as a workshop for the fledgling car manufacturer. At Henniker Mews the duo developed their first model, known as the ‘Coal Scuttle’, completing it in 1915. After an impressive performance at the Aston hill climb, they decided to rename the firm Aston Martin. It is hard to believe from this posh Chelsea interior, that it was where the first Aston Martin was built . These sleek interiors and a slice of motoring history could be yours for £2.5 million . The Coal Scuttle, for all its importance, is no longer thought to exist with records showing it was last registered in 1928. But fast-forward 100 years and Aston Martin, now based in Gaydon, Warwickshire goes from strength to strength having built more than 60,000 high-performance models. The owners of 16 Henniker Mews have now decided to put their home up for sale after living at the address for 17 years. It has been put on the market with the Farrar & Co estate agency for £2.5 million. This is the equivalent of 78 Aston Martin Cygnets, 30 V8 Vantages or 13 Vanquish models. But it is less than the famous Bond DB5, which would set you back in excess of £2.5 million while a unique Aston Martin DB4 ‘Jet’ sold earlier this year for £3.2 million. Spread over 1,217sq/ft, 16 Henniker Mews boasts three bedrooms including one with ensuite, a large reception room and a kitchen/breakfast room. It has an interior designed by Mark Howarth and still boasts the famous garage while a plaque on the outside of the building shows off its famous past. Julian Chambers, from Farrar & Co, said: 'We are delighted to be marketing a house with such a historic provenance. 'Our hope is that the eventual buyer is a car enthusiast that continues the use of the car garage, rather than integrating it into further reception space.' Prior to its use by Aston Martin, 16 Henniker Mews was the London depot of engineering firm Hesse and Savory. Would-be buyers looking for the badge of authenticity need look no further than the plague on the front of the property .

After a catwalk invasion by a pair of bare-breasted feminist protesters, Paris Fashion Week got back on track on day four with strong showings from Christian Dior, Issey Miyake, Roland Mouret and Barbara Bui. While FEMEN activists were busy entertaining baffled tourists on a bateau mouche with a protest in support of Greenpeace, the long awaited new collection from Raf Simons at Dior was proving worth the wait as the designer sent an assured collection dominated by 50s style dresses down the runway, watched by Eva Herzigova and Olivia Palermo. If Simons has his way, the prom dress will stage a comeback next summer, offering up a succession of strapless silk frocks in delicate shimmering grey overlaid with a lace patterned print in navy and ink. But it wasn't all full-skirted gowns. Simons also showed sleek shifts with belled silk skirts in a surprisingly effective combination of blush pink and bright pumpkin as well as in African-inspired multicoloured stripes. Striped success: Raf Simons offered up tight-waisted dresses in an array of hues at Christian Dior . Pumpkin and blush: Pink and orange made a surprisingly good team at Christian Dior . Luxe: A demure dress is given a naughty twist thanks to a tiny cut out that revealed a flash of toned tummy . Blue is the colour: But at Barbara Bui, fashion was the game and she demonstrated just how good she is at it with her denim-heavy vision for next summer . Double denim: Bui appeared to be intent on proving just how versatile the world's favourite off duty fabric can be and used it repeatedly in her latest collection . Royal approval: Princess Stéphanie of Monaco's daughter Pauline Ducruet was accompanied by her adorable pet dog for her front row appearance at Barbara Bui . While Simons' offering was crammed . with colour, Barbara Bui kicked off proceedings with a low key collection . of sporty separates that came in a minimalist palette of navy, black and . stark white enlivened with the odd jolt of bright orange. Denim, . a favourite fabric of the Franco-Vietnamese designer, cropped up repeatedly on . neatly tailored trousers, slouchy bomber jackets and even found its way . onto a bustier.

Print was kept to a minimum and where it did appear, it came in pale grey superimposed over sky blue. Punchy it wasn't, wearable it was. But although Barbara Bui chose to keep pattern in the background, the same couldn't be said for Roland Mouret who used a bold bright pink and cobalt blue petal print to liven up his sporty white shift dresses. Think pink: Bright pink has been a popular choice this month and Rouland Mouret also embraced it . Figure hugging: Rouland Mouret included several variations on his trademark form fitting dress . Embellished: A fuchsia silk gown was given bold sequinned sleeves at Rouland Mouret . Waterproof: Hussein Chalayan appeared to have British buyers in mind as he showed his collection accessoried with rain repelling clear plastic hats . Challenging: Chalayan had plenty of desirable silk pieces in fluid cream silk as well as more directional pieces such as this dress made from multicoloured ribbons . Graphic block print was also used, . showing up on peg leg trousers, a cross-strap crop top and a slouchy . 1980s style leather jacket. Dresses, . Mouret's trademark were in relatively short supply but just when it . seemed that the man who brought us the iconic Galaxy dress was . going to end the show with more trousers, the first of a set of suitably . va va voom frocks appeared at the end of the runway.

Lovely though Chalayan's pieces were, the title of best in show on day four was taken by Japanese veteran Issey Miyake, whose expert touch with tailoring left the front row staring lustfully after the clothes as they sashayed out of sight. Highlights included an silk shirt-dress in striking blue, green and pink block print and a delicate round-shouldered coat dress in multi-tonal striped blue and crimson organza. But with more than five decades of design experience, you wouldn't expect anything less from Miyake. Lucky too, that unlike poor beleaguered Nina Ricci, no uninvited Ukrainian protesters turned up to spoil the show.

Her floral teapots and polka dot aprons have been winning over middle-class mothers since she opened her first 'glorified junk shop' in London's Holland Park 20 years ago. Having expanded to incorporate everything from pastel wallpaper to pink spotty dog collars, Cath Kidston's oh-so-British brand of flower-bedecked homeware has now succeeded in attracting an unlikely - and lucrative - new fan base. Asian customers eager to snap up a slice of the 54-year-old's vision of domestic bliss - inspired by her own childhood in rural Hampshire - have helped to propel sales past the £100million mark for the first time. Business is blooming: Demand from Asian consumers has helped to propel sales of Cath Kidston's distinctive brand of floral homeware past the £100million mark for the first time . The retail chain's latest annual figures reveal overseas sales have rocketed by 53 per cent - driven by demand in Asia for the British heritage encapsulated in Kidston's floral cake stands or pastel tablecloths. Cath Kidston will add a second Shanghai store to its 30 other outlets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan later this year. There are 32 Cath Kidston stores in Japan, meaning the brand now has more overseas outlets than British stores. Shabby chic: A Cath Kidston branch in Chelsea - the brand now has more stores overseas than it does in Britain . Al fresco: Cath Kidston's signature florals have expanded beyond the kitchen to include garden gazebos and picnic blankets . But Kidston's signature style still has plenty of fans at home in the UK, where sales rose 21 per cent in spite of the tough economic climate. Appeal: Cath Kidston has written a book about her business success entitled Coming Up Roses . Overall the firm's results for the year to March 31 indicate annual sales are up 19 per cent to £105million. And it seems the business - controlled since 2010 by American private equity group TA Associates, who own a 60 per cent stake - has no intention of resting on its laurels now. Yet more new stores are planned in Singapore and Indonesia - where the growing middle-class population has been identified as a potential market for Kidston's aspirational products. China and Japan have also been earmarked by the firm for further expansion. The firm's chief executive Kenny Wilson told The Telegraph: 'We feel confident that consumers in Asia like the brand. 'With the broad appeal of our products across the globe and the strong customer response to our brand in both the UK and Asia, we look to the future with confidence,' he added. The continued demand for the instantly recognisable brand is evident in the sheer amount of products that have been given Kidston's retro treatment. A scan of the retailer's website reveals how devotees can deck out not just their home but also themselves and their children in Kidston's trademark blooms and pastels. Her signature antique rosebuds adorn everything from babyclothes and women's dresses to garden gazebos and wellingtons. Aspirational: Today Cath Kidston sells dresses and shoes alongside kitchenware and floral cushion covers . The 54-year-old designer, who retains an estimated 20 per cent stake in the business and remains its creative director, is the niece of Charles Henry Allsopp, the 6th Baron Hindlip. Her cousin is the TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp, who herself is bringing her own brand of vintage-style homeware to the masses with a range for Marks & Spencer. Kidston worked for the interior designer Nicky Haslam before setting up her own business, after spotting potential in her homemade ironing board cover. Modern vintage: Cath Kidston's floral tents began cropping up at the Glastonbury festival as her popularity grew . As a young designer, her idyllic childhood in the English countryside provided Cath Kidston with the inspiration she need to create what is now a global brand. It was nostalgia for the colours, prints and fabrics of her childhood home that informed Kidston's concept of 'modern vintage' - the style she hit upon after spotting a picture in a magazine of rose wallpaper on the side of a bath. She opened her first tiny store close to Holland Park in 1993, with a start-up budget of £15,000 - almost a third of which she ploughed into creating her first print, Rose Bouquet. Kidston used vintage fabrics to . produce cheerful floral ironing board covers and cushion covers which . she sold alongside second hand furniture. As her store grew in popularity, press attention followed, and so too did hordes of customers. By . the late 1990s the Cath Kidston brand was expanding with more London . stores and new prints and products, and she attracted a celebrity fan . base. Glastonbury was first accused of having become middle-class when . festival-goers were spotted sporting playful Cath Kidston wellies to . tramp through the mud between stages. After .

Lord Lawson's Global Warming Policy Foundation say the Met Office's predictions are biased . The Met Office’s global warming predictions are flawed and could result in millions of pounds being squandered, it is claimed. A report for a think tank led by former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson says a computer programme behind figures that shape climate change policy is biased in favour of higher temperatures. Large sums of public and private sector money could be ‘malinvested’ in everything from wind farms to heat-proof road surfaces as a result, it claims. Lord Lawson, chairman of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said: ‘The Government’s policy of abandoning cheap conventional energy and moving to expensive (and unreliable) renewable energy has always been of dubious merit. 'The fact that it now emerges this policy has been based on projections by a computer model which has been found to be fatally flawed means that an independent expert review of the model and its projections is both essential and urgent.’ The claim, hotly disputed by the Met Office, comes as scientists and officials meet in Stockholm to finalise a major report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Experts claim the think tank timed its report to undermine the IPCC, which is expected to say the case for man-made global warming is stronger than ever. The report attacks HadCM3, a programme used to predict the effect of carbon dioxide levels. Squandered: Millions of pounds of public money could be wrongly invested into wind farms and other renewable energy sources, the report claims . It says there is a glitch in the way it factors in the impact of low-lying cloud, with estimates of small temperature rises adjusted upwards. Report author Andrew Montford said: ‘The UK’s official climate predictions are therefore unreliable and excessively alarmist. ‘The problem is highly technical but its implications are that the model, as currently used, will always provide high estimates of future warming.’ However, the Met Office said it is confident in HadCM3. It said it uses data from many models, and the figures are independently reviewed. Bob Ward, a climate change expert at the London School of Economics, said: ‘This is a political stunt by Lord Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation to try to distract attention from the IPCC report. Rejected: The Met Office strongly dispute the report and add that they have confidence in the computer programme behind their predictions - HadCM3 . ‘The Met Office climate model is based on the best available scientific evidence and expert judgment.’ Drafts of the IPCC report – the first in six years – say it is at least 95 per cent certain human activity is the main cause of temperature rises since the 1950s. That is up from 90 per cent in 2007, and 66 per cent in 2001. The assessment will be used by governments worldwide to set policy.","Think tank led by former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson says figures that shape climate change policy are 'biased'

Mary Berry was mystified by the use of hemp flour – made from cannabis plants – on the Great British Bake Off this week. But given the plant’s myriad nutritional benefits, she might want to make it a kitchen staple. Hemp seeds, from which it is milled, are high in protein, fibre and healthy fats. Flour power: Mary Berry takes a whiff of contestant Howard Middleton's hemp flower on Tuesday's episode of Great British Bake Off . A research review found that a high intake could help tackle heart disease, improve cholesterol levels and reduce blood clot formation. Hemp seeds also increase levels of important fatty acids in the blood, as the seeds are high in omega-3 and omega-6. But scientists report that legal issues and misunderstandings have slowed research progress. Mary, can rest easy, however, for hemp is safe – and legal – as it’s derived from a variety of cannabis that doesn’t contain the psychoactive ingredient THC. Health itself: Hemp flour is made from hemp seeds which grows on the cannabis plant . People who think they protect the family from their cigarette smoke by lighting up only when home alone might need to think again. Studies suggest tobacco residue stays in a room long after the smoker has gone. Researchers in California tested hotel rooms in which smoking was allowed and found levels of tobacco by-products up  to 75 times higher than in hotels that  banned smoking. Non-smokers stayed in hotels overnight, and finger-wipe analysis afterwards found nicotine on their skin, with the highest levels in those who stayed in ‘smoking’ rooms – suggesting that cigarette residue lingers in the air and on surfaces. Running along: Spencer Matthews . Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews is swapping champagne and canapes for cereal bars and protein shakes, and running the New York Marathon in a bid to lose weight. Spencer, 25, confessed: ‘Ever since I was young my weight has fluctuated and I put on pounds more easily than I’d like. 'I live life to extremes and when I am in party boy mode, drinking and eating to excess, it can creep on pretty quickly. 'I’ve signed up to the marathon so I have an incentive to run.’ Spencer will be flying to the US for the event, on November 3, with personal trainer Shane Collins, who works with singer Natalie Imbruglia and TV presenter  Zoe Hardman. But there is one problem: ‘I suffer from shin splints,’ Spencer says. Nearly 60 per cent of womb cancer cases could be prevented if women exercised for at least 30 minutes a day and kept off excess body fat. And the UK-based World Cancer Research Fund International warns that eating lots of high-GI foods, such as sugar and processed food, increases cancer risk as obesity affects hormones like oestrogen and insulin – both at the root of this cancer.

A 19-year-old man was charged Thursday with hacking webcams at the home of Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf and other women to extort nude photos and videos from them, with authorities contending he forced several women to strip. Jared James Abrahams of Temecula surrendered to agents at the FBI office in Orange County to face a charge of extortion that could send him to federal prison for up to two years, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said. He was later freed on $50,000 bail but a judge confined him to his family home, ordered him to wear a GPS monitor, and said he could only use the home computer for schoolwork, with software to be installed that will monitor its use. Scroll down for video . Caught: Jared James Abrahams surrendered to FBI agents in Orange County on Thursday. He is accused of hacking into Miss USA, formerly Miss California, Cassidy Wolf's webcam and taking nude pictures of her, which he used to extort her . Authorities said Abrahams knew Wolf, a 19-year-old graduate of Great Oak High School in Temecula who won the Miss Teen USA crown Aug. 9. She is identified only by her initials in the criminal complaint. Last month, Wolf told the website of NBC's ""Today"" show that earlier this year she received an anonymous email in which the sender claimed to have stolen images from the camera on her home computer. The sender of the email threatened to go public with images captured from Wolf's webcam unless she would provide nude pictures of herself, Eimiller said - a crime commonly known as 'sextortion.' Instead, Wolf went to authorities, and an investigation was launched in March. Bail posted: Jared James Abrahams appears Thursday outside of Santa Ana, CA., court after posting $50,000 bail for his release . Above screen grab courtesy of NBC Los Angeles. A federal complaint filed on Sept. 17 and unsealed Thursday charges Jared James Abrahams with extortion but Eimiller said other charges are possible. An FBI agent's affidavit, included in the complaint, contends that Abrahams used malicious software to remotely operate webcams to capture nude photos and videos of at least seven women as they changed clothes - some of whom he knew personally and others he found by hacking Facebook pages. The agent alleged that Abrahams, when interviewed, acknowledged controlling 30 to 40 hacked computers and extorting some women. Abrahams, a college freshman majoring in computer science, allegedly would use the women's webcams to capture nude images, then send emails threatening to post them on their hacked social media accounts unless they either sent him nude photos, a nude video, or logged onto the Skype video chat service and follow his orders for five minutes. He allegedly threatened Wolf that unless she heeded his demands, he would release her nude photos 'all over the Internet' and 'your dream of being a model will be transformed into a pornstar.' According to the affidavit, the victims included several women from other countries. Sextortion: Wolf says the stalker used an anonymous email address and demanded sexual favors or else he'd release nude photos of her to the press . Shock: Cassidy Wolf, from California, was crowned as Miss Teen USA 2013 in the Bahamas . One teenager in Ireland responded to the demands by writing: 'Please remember I'm 17. Have a heart,' according to the court record. Abrahams allegedly responded: 'I'll tell you this right now! I do NOT have a heart. However, I do stick to my deals. Also age doesn't mean a thing to me!!!' The girl then allegedly stripped during a Skype session, according to the FBI affidavit. A woman in Canada also stripped, according to the document. He also allegedly received webcam photographs from women in Southern California, Baltimore and Russia, according to the court document. Beauty queen: Months ahead of the pageant, 19-year-old Wolf (left) was the victim of the cyber-crime . Abrahams' case follows two earlier California trials in which hackers pleaded guilty to accessing computers and obtaining nude photos. Karen 'Gary' Kazaryan of Glendale pleaded guilty in July to hacking into hundreds of social media and email accounts to get women to pose naked for him. Authorities said he targeted as many as 350 women. He pleaded guilty to identity theft and unauthorized use of a protected computer. In December, a federal judge in Los Angeles sentenced Christopher Chaney of Florida to 10 years in prison after he broke into the personal online accounts of Scarlett Johansson, Christina Aguilera and other women and posted nude photos and other material on the Internet.

A woman scorned: LaShonda Matlock wrote an angry open letter to her father, preacher Bill Adkins, telling him to 'go to hell' The ignored daughter of a well-known Memphis preacher has written a scathing open letter to her estranged father detailing his abandonment and telling him to 'Go to hell'. Titled ‘Letter to My Father Bill Adkins: Go to Hell,’ La Shonda Matlock’s open letter Wednesday called her estranged father’s faith, manhood and moral character into question while detailing his cruel ignorance of her existence for decades. Mr Adkins is the founder and pastor of Greater Imani Church. ‘There are times in life when you need to speak up, voice an opinion or just let it all out,’ Ms Matlock, 33, wrote to begin the letter. ‘This is one of those moments.’ The self-proclaimed ‘illegitimate daughter of married pastor Bill Adkins’ claims that despite growing up only five blocks from his church, he never visited her and even sent a cease and desist order demanding she stop trying to contact him - when she was only six-years-old. Mr Adkins even visited her elementary school when she was eight-years-old, only to ignore her, she claims. By age 10, Ms Matlock felt lost. ‘I was a figment of my own imagination. I didn't exist, my last name was a lie and all records of me were buried in a black hole,’ she wrote. Crediting her ‘wonderful mother and extended family’ for helping her deal with growing up without a father, Ms Matlock said she ‘never wanted of went without anything,’ even designer heels – but still she felt empty. ‘I had a good childhood, but the lies kept piling upon one after another,’ Ms Matlock wrote. ‘As I grew older into my teens my face became the exact image of a man I never knew.’ ‘Rumors spread and I became a topic at dinner parties and for bored housewives,’ Ms Matlock continued. ‘I never wanted the attention, only to… have a dad like everyone else and like any child to have a father's love.’ Explaining that she ran into the preacher only four years ago, Ms Matlock made an attempt to talk to him, only to be derailed by a gun-toting security guard – who reached for his gun as she approached him. Go to hell: Mr Adkins illegitimate daughter asked he lives with himself and told him to go to hell . ‘I forgive you,’ I shouted. He nodded. That was my only acknowledgement I have ever received,’ Ms matlock writes of how the encounter ended.

At least 71 iPads went missing last year from the Los Angeles Unified School District. The lost devices, worth a total of just over $48k, are among the iPads used in a 13-school trial run of a $1 billion program designed to improve education. If all goes according to plan, the program will supply 640,000 students, or every student in LA's school system, with the costly Apple tablet for free by 2014. The bulk of the 71 missing devices worth $678 each, disappeared from one school called Valley Academy of Arts and Sciences in Granada Hills, California. Approximately 1,200 iPads were distributed to the school last year. By year's end, 69 were unaccounted for. While the 71 missing iPads have been linked to the students assigned to each tablet, according to the Los Angeles Times, 'if students claim they turned in their device, the district may have no way to prove otherwise.' Despite the dissapearance of 71 iPads from LA school district, 640,000 students in California will eventually receive free Apple tablets for educational purposes. But the loss of approximately $48k in iPads has not deterred the LA Unified School District from their plan to put iPads in every students hands by next year. Officials told the LA Times that since the thefts, new security measures were implemented to keep track of the tablets, intended to be sent home with students.'We have a very vigorous control for this rollout,' said Lt. Jose Santome of the school district's Police Department. 'We know what's going out and deployed on every campus.'

A father with a rare condition which left him in agonising pain at the slightest touch has kissed his wife for the first time in four years - after having a piece of his skull removed. Mark Steadman, 38, was unable to go outside or wash his face after being diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) in 2009. The condition - which affects 12 out of every 100,000 people in the UK each year - leaves sufferers with pain in their face which is so bad more than a quarter commit suicide. Mark Steadman, 38, is able to kiss his wife, Louise, and children for the first time in four years after having surgery to cure his agonising face and teeth pains . It is caused by pressure on the trigeminal nerve - the largest nerve inside the skull. The father-of-three was left in such agony even the slightest kiss or breath of wind on his skin felt like he had been ‘hit by lightning’. He was forced to take a cocktail of powerful painkillers, including morphine, which left him in a zombie-like state. But he has now been able to kiss his wife Louise, 35, for the first time since 2009 after he had a 10p sized piece of his skull removed. During the six-hour operation at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital on September 3, surgeons removed a piece of his skull in order to gain access to the nerve which they then wrapped in Teflon. The treatment is expected to mean Mr Steadman, a probation service officer, remains pain-free for the next decade when he will have to undergo another operation. Mr Steadman (pictured with his wife and son, Leon, four) had trigeminal neuralgia - a condition caused by pressure being put on the largest nerve in the skull. It caused him to suffer bouts of extreme pain up to 250 times a day. The pain could be triggered by the slightest touch - including a kiss from his wife . Mr Steadman, of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, said: ‘The surgery has transformed my life - I cannot say how wonderful it is to kiss Louise and my kids again. ‘Even though I’ve had part of my skull removed it’s worth it to be able to be a normal dad and husband again. ‘It was horrible being in the same house as my family and not be able to show them affection because I knew the pain would be so awful. ‘The disease destroyed my life - the pain is so debilitating you can’t do anything. ‘Once I was at my parents’ house for dinner and before the spoon even got to my mouth I was on the floor in agony. Mr Steadman had surgery at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital to remove part of his skull and have his trigeminal nerve wrapped in Teflon - he has been pain-free ever since the operation on September 3 . Mr Steadman said: 'The surgery has transformed my life - I cannot say how wonderful it is to kiss Louise and my kids again' ‘It feels like you have been hit in the face with a bolt of lightning, or at its worse like a whole thunder storm has hit you. ‘There were up to 250 attacks a day. ‘Sometimes the pain would drop me to my knees- other times it would feel like all of my teeth on the right hand side were just on fire. ‘The only treatments were to take 50 pills a day, and they just left me like a zombie. I was just sat in my chair completely zoned out. ‘If I needed to go to the toilet I needed someone to walk in front of me so I didn’t bump into things. Mr Steadman (pictured after his operation) was in so much pain that he had to take 50 painkillers a day, including morphine. He says the drugs left him in a zombie-like state . ‘They had to take away the medication and let my wife look after it because the temptation to take another pill to help ease the pain is too much.’ Mr Steadman explained that the problem started in 2009 with a pain in his teeth. He went to the dentist and was told the pain was caused by him grinding his teeth in the night but his wife said that he never did that. Mr Steadman then went to his GP who also believed that grinding his teeth could be the problem. Mr Steadman said: ‘I felt like I was almost cracking up, I knew there was a problem but no-one seemed to know. Mr Steadman said: 'It feels like you have been hit in the face with a bolt of lightning, or at its worse like a whole thunder storm has hit you. There were up to 250 attacks a day' ‘It’s been a real battle, you spend your whole life trying to avoid the pain. It could be the gentlest of breath or a kiss off my wife and kids. ‘I would get up in the morning and look outside and see the trees blowing and stand there in absolute panic saying “I can’t go out”.’ The couple, who have three children James, 15, Emily, 13, and four-year-old Leon, got married seven years ago. Mrs Steadman, a full-time mother and Mr Steadman’s carer, said: ‘The condition was a nightmare for us. Mark had to sleep downstairs. ‘We’ve been together for 18 years but married seven years ago so basically for more than half our married life together I wasn’t able to kiss my husband. Mr Steadman is now expected to be free from pain for about ten years after which he may require more surgery to prevent the pain returning . ‘I cannot describe how good it is to have my husband back. I can’t stop kissing Mark now.’ Shockingly, trigeminal neuralgia is known as the ‘Suicide Disease’ because 27 per cent of sufferers kill themselves because they are unable to bear the pain. Professor Hugh Coakham, a neurosurgeon at the privately-run Spire Hospital in Bristol, and expert in the condition, said: ‘Research suggests the pain is caused by a blood vessel pressing against the trigeminal nerve and wearing away the nerve’s protective myelin sheath. ‘Sufferers experience these horrible electric shock-like feelings. ‘It mostly affects middle-aged and older people. This may be because blood vessels become gnarled and twisted with age, encroach over the nerve and wear down the insulating sheath.’ Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden and severe facial nerve pain - the pain is so severe that it drives many sufferers to suicide. As a result, it has been dubbed the 'suicide disease'. The pain has been described as like a stabbing or piercing pain. Each attack lasts for between a few seconds and two minutes. The pain usually only affects one side of the face - most commonly the right side. Triggers include talking, smiling, chewing, touch, swallowing and a cool breeze. In 80 to 90 per cent of patients the pain is caused by pressure on the trigeminal nerve - the largest nerve in the skull. The condition affects four or five people out of every 100,000. Almost twice as many women as men are affected. It is most common in people between the ages of 60 and 70 and is very rare in under 40s. There is no cure for the condition which usually gets worse over time. Treatment options include taking painkillers, or having surgery to relieve the pressure on the nerve. However, the pain sometimes recurs after the surgery. Source: NHS Choices .","Mark Steadman first developed pain in his face and teeth in 2009 .

It was also the scene of the Zimmermans' domestic dispute earlier this month. In the latest twist in the Zimmerman saga, Mrs Dean now claims he left with her belongings when she ordered him to vacate the property by yesterday, TMZ reported.

Scene: Shellie Zimmerman's parents called police to their house in Lake Mary, Florida on Thursday, claiming that they had had items stolen. George Zimmerman is the home's tenant, police said . When police responded to the scene, . they said there was no sign of a break in and reportedly characterized . it as a landlord-tenant dispute between Zimmerman and his in-laws. Officer Zach Hudson added that other people may also have been staying in the house and told the Orlando Sentinel. The home is the same place Lake Mary police were called out to earlier in September after an altercation broke out between George and Shellie. In a 911 call from that incident, Shellie alleged that George punched her father in the face.

She filed for divorce from him three weeks ago but has been unable to serve him the divorce papers because she does not know where he is, she said. The interview on Thursday was first since a domestic dispute between the couple at the Lake Mary home earlier this month. She had called police to report that . her estranged husband had threatened to shoot her and her father after . punching him and smashing her iPad. But Zimmerman disputed the claims, . instead blaming Shellie for starting the argument and hitting him with . the iPad. Police responded to the scene but neither side pressed . charges.

On Friday, Lake Mary police told Local 6 that they will attempt to extract video from the iPad that was shattered in the domestic dispute - despite previously expressing their doubt they would try. Pieces have been sent to a forensics lab to try to get the video Shellie took of the fight. But the device was seriously damaged in the fight and police said there is only a five per cent chance they'll be able to retrieve the video. In the Today interview, Shellie added that she no longer feels like she can trust her husband or his version of events in the Trayvon Martin shooting after how he has treated her. 'I'm conflicted,' she said. 'I believe the evidence but this revelation in my life has helped me take the blinders off.

Billy Graham's grandson claims Evangelicals are 'worse' than the Catholic Church on responding to sex abuse claims. Speaking at a conference hosted by the Religion Newswriter Association on Thursday, Professor Boz Tchividjian, the third-eldest grandchild of Reverend Billy Graham, also said that Christian missions overseas are a 'magnet' for sex abusers. 'I think we are worse [than Catholics],' Tchividjian told the audience at the Austin, Texas, conference according to Religion News Service. In an uncompromising address, Tchividjian added that too many Evangelicals had 'sacrificed the souls' of young victims. Professor Boz Tchividjian with grandfather Reverend Billy Graham. Tchividjian claims Evangelicals are 'worse' than Catholics in responding to sexual abuse case . 'Protestants can be very arrogant when pointing to Catholics,' Tchividjian said. 'We’ve got the Gospels backwards.' Tchividjian is a law professor at Liberty University, a Christian college in Virgina founded by Jerry Falwell, the Southern Baptist pastor who died in 2007. Falwell is remembered for defining televangelism and founding the Moral Majority, a right-wing Christian political organization. Tchividjian told the Austin RNA conference that Christian mission agencies keep reports of sexual abuse secret and fail to report abuse to local authorities. Reverend Billy Graham in his 1957 prime. His grandson claims Evangelicals have failed to respond to claims of sex abuse in the church . The agencies fear being barred from working in foreign countries, according to research by Tchividjian. He said abusers may be sent home by the agencies but if transgressions go unreported they can easily join another agency and repeat their abusive behavior. According to reported data, at least 25 percent of abuse cases are repeat offenders, Tchividjian said. An anti-child abuse activist, Tchividjian is executive director of Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment (GRACE), an organization which has investigated sex abuse allegations. Tchividjian was previously Assistant State Attorney for Florida’s 7th Judicial Circuit where he created the Crimes Against Children' division of the State Attorney's office. Tchividjian's recent comments echo an interview he gave earlier this year where he claimed Christian institutions had put their own reputations before the welfare of sex abuse victims. 'What makes such responses even more heinous is that they are often justified in the name of “protecting the name of Christ”,' he said. 'Silence is one of the most common failures of the Christian community in preventing child abuse,' he said in the interview. 'Too many within the Christian community respond to the prevalence of child abuse with a dangerous and very hurtful silence. 'A silence that is too often preferred over acknowledging the existence of such evil within our midst. A silence that is too often preferred over openly discussing how to protect our little ones from perpetrators.' Professor Boz Tchividjian, grandson of Reverend Billy Graham, fights church sex abuse. He says too many evangelicals had 'sacrificed the souls' of young victims . The Catholic Church has been mired in a series of highly controversial and widespread sex abuses cases around the world. The Church has also battled allegations it systemically harbored abusers and provided a safe haven for them rather than turn the accused over to law enforcement agencies. The scandals have included allegations, investigations, trials and convictions of child sexual abuse committed by priests, nuns and members of the church's hierarchy, sometimes against children just three years old. A damning report on abuse nine years ago found evidence that priests were moved out of countries where they had been accused of abusing children and were able to start new lives elsewhere and, in some cases, continue working with children. It is estimated the Catholic Church has paid over two billion dollars in compensation to sex abuse victims in the U.S. alone. A 2007 case in Los Angeles saw the nation’s largest Catholic archdiocese settle its long list of sex abuse cases for at least $600 million.

He says he is often absent-minded, will forget why he walked into a room and struggles to remember what is on his shopping list. But Paul Hyland never forgets a face, and his unusual talent has seen him recruited as one of a new breed of crimefighters – a Scotland Yard ‘super-recogniser’. Several years ago, police in London were on the lookout for a man wanted for nine burglaries. About a month after seeing the suspect’s picture, PC Hyland was stuck in traffic with two of his colleagues. Never forgets a face: When police are trying to identify suspects from a crime Paul Hyland scans the surveillance footage before heading out on his normal police officer duties. The Met Police knows if he sees someone once, he never forgets a face . ‘I looked up and noticed this guy coming out of a university and knew it was him,’ he said. He quickly arrested the suspect, who went on to confess to the burglaries. He added: ‘If I’ve met someone before and see them again, I’ll usually know where I know them from, even if I can’t remember their name.’ But the 30-year-old officer said his incredible capacity to remember faces tends not to help him in his everyday life. ‘I’m quite forgetful with basic things,’ he said. ‘I’ll walk into a room and forget what I was coming in for, or I’ll drive to the shops and get a load of stuff except for what I was supposed to get. I’m not good with a shopping list.’ Met Police officers designated as Super . Recognisers examine surveillance footage such as this still of Danielle . Corns, pictured left smiling on CCTV during the riots in Wolverhampton . city centre, and right, outside court. She was found guilty of stealing . two left-footed trainers. So far the 'super recognisers' are only . operating in London . Scotland Yard has now transferred Mr Hyland to their super-recogniser team, an elite squad of around 200 London officers trained to identify criminal suspects. Psychologists are still baffled by their abilities, but officials say they have tripled the number of successful identifications they make every week and even helped prevent muggings, drug deals and assaults. Police officers with unusually sensitive facial recognition skills have been identified within the London Met Police. They . all hold front line positions, in units such as the Safer Neighbourhood . Teams, Robbery Squads, Intelligence Units, or in custody suites, where . they keep up a good knowledge of local trouble makers. When . necessary they will be required to view stills and videos from footage . of crime scenes so they can become familiar with suspects they are . looking for. They . are then on the lookout for these people as they go about their usual . front line duties, be it as part of the Neighbourhood Crime Teams or . others. Mick . Neville, Det Ch Insp at the Met Police's Central Forensic Image Team, . said in an email that the 'super recognisers' identify on average about . 100 suspects a week in London. He . said: 'They have had a very good ""hit rate"". For example PC Gary . Collins from Hackney produced 180 idents from riot footage.  The current . conviction rate (in general) for riot matters is 87 per cent.' Every . person identified by an officer as being a potential suspect is . followed up, 'in the same manner as fingerprint and DNA evidence,' he . said. 'In the case of . images, a Sgt reviews the identification and research is done on the . named person to establish if their location/offending pattern matches . the crime in question. 'Very . few people are charged on ident evidence alone - a detective would . arrest the subject and question him... and search for the clothing in . the image or the stolen property etc,' he said in email. 'In . the case of a very serious crime e.g. murder, by knowing the Super . Recognisers we can ensure that these officers see any images FIRST - . ensuring that we limit the possibility of false identifications/wrong . leads.' He added: 'It is another tactic to make London safer AND make best use of our resources.' Detective Chief Inspector Mick Neville  said: ‘When we have an image of an unidentified criminal, I know exactly who to ask instead of sending it out to everyone and getting a bunch of false leads.’ He decided to set up the unit in 2011 after realising that the police could identify criminals based on their DNA and fingerprints, but had nothing to help them find suspects solely by using their images. The team has so far been remarkably successful – even outperforming facial recognition computer programs. They proved especially valuable during the London riots in summer 2011. After the violence subsided, Scotland Yard combed through hundreds of hours of surveillance video. So far there have been nearly 5,000 arrests – and around 4,000 of those were based on police identifications of suspects from video images. The super-recognisers were responsible for nearly 30 per cent of the identifications, including one officer who found around 300 people. However a facial recognition program made only one successful identification. Scotland Yard says the team also prevented thefts and assaults at last month’s Notting Hill Carnival – and even helped catch a drug dealer. Mr Neville admitted that the officers, like the Yard’s specially trained sniffer dogs, are not infallible. He explained that their identification is often only the start of a case which prompts police to start looking for other evidence. But legal experts warned that it could be problematic to use super-recognisers as expert witnesses in court if they have identified criminals based on an imperfect image. Mike Redmayne, a law professor at the London School of Economics, said: ‘Unless we subject them to rigorous testing, then we are just taking their word on trust. ‘Perhaps they can do what they say, but we don’t have the evidence yet. If it was up to me, I would not allow it in court.’ And Charles Farrier, from UK privacy group No CCTV, claimed the unit was just ‘the latest gimmick’ to promote the widespread use of surveillance cameras. He said: ‘It is a slippery slope when we want to start to justify the widespread use of blanket surveillance just in case a policeman spots someone. The use of super-recognisers will lead to cases of mistaken identity and forms part of a surveillance culture that spreads fear and distrust.’ Clarice Ali was caught on CCTV making an obscene gesture to the camera while her . daughter stands beside her, a blue scarf wrapped around her head. Ali and her daughter were arrested and given custodial sentences for their looting. It is not known if Ali, right, was found by a 'super recogniser' Shereka Leigh (centre) was filmed trying on trainers from a looted JD Sports store at the Tottenham Hale Retail Park in north London.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:56 EST, 27 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:43 EST, 28 September 2013 . A high school football team in upstate New York has decided to not finish the season after a teammate died in a tackle mid-game. Damon Janes, 16, a running back for the Westfield-Brocton Wolverines, died only days after an illegal helmet-to-helmet tackle during the team's second game of the season landed him in the hospital. The team took a paper-ballot vote and decided to suspend the season - they were unable to carry on because of how painful dealing with Mr Janes' death has become. A life ended too soon: Damon Janes, a 16-year-old junior running back, died after losing consciousness from a helmet-to-helmet hit in a game . 'I wanted to play, I love the game,' said teammate Stevie Wisecarver, a 16-year-old quarterback who has played football since third grade. 'But it just wouldn't feel right without him. The team just didn't feel right.' 'It feels like there's more to life. Before, football used to be life for me; it was the only sport I played. But now I realize that there's more than just playing the game, ' added 17-year-old senior cornerback Joey Villafrank: . It's a grief that's spread through the close-knit villages of Brocton and Westfield, tucked amid grape farms about an hour's drive south of Buffalo, where the once-rival high schools were forced to combine their teams three seasons ago because of budget cuts. Townspeople have held vigils, lit candles and released balloons. They've stayed up nights making ribbons and cookies as fundraisers for the Janes family. A town shaken: Signs for Damon Janes hang in the window of Studio 64 in Brocton, N.Y. Hair salons are dyeing streaks of blue and green, reflecting Westfield's school colors of blue and white and Brocton's of green. Memorial T-shirts with Damon's motto are being printed. And a spaghetti dinner benefit at the Nickel Plate Depot planned for Sunday is expected to draw hundreds. 'It's just a tragic thing that happened,' 71-year-old Harold Montague said as he finished his coffee at the Green Arch, recalling a procession for Damon's funeral that stretched for more than a mile and a half. 'A lot's been done that I've never seen before.' Damon took what hospital officials would later describe as a 'helmet-to-helmet' hit during the third quarter of Westfield-Brocton's Sept. 13 game against Portville, a 32-6 loss. He was able to get on his feet but lost consciousness on the sidelines. Just a young boy: Mr Janes was only 16 when his life was cut tragically short . He died three days later at Women & Children's Hospital in Buffalo. An exact cause of death has not been released. In his obituary, his family wrote that Damon liked fishing, hunting and just about every kind of sport — soccer, basketball, ice skating, motocross and snowboarding. 'He put 110 percent into everything he did,' it said. 'His motto was, 'Giving up is simply not an option.' For some parents, the dangers were obvious even before Damon's death. As their sadness began to mix with anger, they complained that poor officiating, with no penalty calls on late hits, made it only a matter of time before ball carriers like Damon got hurt. Doing what he loved: Mr Janes (far left) died after a vicious helmet-to-helmet tackle during a game . 'That whole game was plagued with late hits and people using their helmets to spear other people,' said Sam Villafrank, Joey's father. 'It was like anything goes.' School officials did not return calls seeking comment on the accusation. Concern about increasingly hard hits among the 1 million boys who play high school football has brought renewed attention to concussion management and a national initiative to teach the 'Heads Up' tackling technique. An average of 12 high school and college players die annually, according to a recent study in the American Journal of Sports Medicine. Only 16-years-old: Mr janes had barely earned his driver's license when he died . Damon's was at least the fifth high school football death this season, but his was the only team to cancel the season because of it. As iridescent ribbons sparkle from light poles in Brocton, the players say they are moving on without football after making a decision that's drawn both support and criticism — from those who believe Damon would have wanted the season to go on. 'Honestly, none of us can really say what Damon would have wanted,' Villafrank said. 'The only person who could have said that was Damon. And unfortunately, he's not here anymore.'","Damon Janes, 16, died after a helmet-to-helmet hit .
