"(CNN) -- The homicide rate in Mexico's most violent city -- Ciudad Juarez -- is down, according to Mexican President Felipe Calderon, but some residents of the city are not convinced. ""We are facing an entirely political statement, which is not based on reality. A statistic must be considered as a long process and not in a comparison of one month to another,"" Ciudad Juarez criminologist Oscar Maynes said. Over the weekend, Calderon said homicides had fallen by 60% in Juarez since last October, comparing statistics from that month with April's numbers. Speaking during an event that commemorated the city's 100th anniversary and its participation in the Mexican Revolution, Calderon said Juarez was ""going through a time of darkness"" and defended his crime-fighting strategy. ""There are probably variations and jumps [in the murder rate] because the evil of criminals are still there, but we must persevere in our efforts,"" he said. But several days after Calderon's departure, some residents remained skeptical of his assessment. ""The president just came here and (violence) went down, but to say 60 or 70% is a lie -- he just left and the violence continues,"" Juarez resident Gaspar Rocha told CNN. ""You have seen what has happened in the past and it will continue and continue and (Calderon) will leave. They're just words...it's a lie."" University professor Hugo Almada cautioned that the government should take a more measured approach. ""It seemed to me that the tone of the speech was very triumphant, and it should have been more moderate, because we have already had other moments in which it seems there a slight decrease in the situation, and later it picks up again,"" he said. October 2010 saw a record of 359 homicides in the city, according to figures kept by the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. The deadliest month was followed by 198 homicides in November and 213 in December. The pace of homicides continued into the New Year, with 215 killed in January and 231 in February. In March and April 2011 there were 176 and 271 homicides, respectively. In his speech, Calderon used figures from the country's public safety secretary, which said there had been 166 homicides in April and 417 in October 2010. The state attorney general's office said there has been a marked decrease in homicides in May, with 118 victims so far. Maynes said the recent decline is due to multiple factors, but not to police or intelligence strategies of government officials. ""Violence is down at the border, but they have killed many people. People with resources have gone, or are paying an extortion fee, but I do not see any strategy that is working,"" Maynes said. To accurately measure a trend, it's necessary to compare rates over a one-year period, not month to month, Maynes said. ""We have to recognize that the economy has not improved, the shops are closed -- that is the most valid demonstration. The effect is not just felt in terms of border killings, but also kidnapping, extortion and assaults,"" he added. During Calderon's visit, state officials said they were beginning a new effort to help re-brand the city's violent image: changing its name. Government officials approved a name change to ""Heroic Ciudad Juarez"" to emphasize the city's participation in the Mexican Revolution, but only as a symbolical slogan and not for official purposes, said Enrique Serrano Escobar, coordinator with the office of Chihuahua state representatives. Homicides in Juarez, which borders El Paso, Texas, are often attributed to two violent drug cartels battling for turf in the city. Ciudad Juarez is the city with the highest number of homicides in Mexico, with a record 8,000 victims since 2008, according to the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. But this week, the city saw a brief respite. For 28 hours, between 7 p.m. Monday and 11 p.m. Tuesday, there were no reports of homicides. Journalist Edgar Roman contributed to this report.","Calderon says violence is down 60%, comparing statistics from October and April .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge in Mexico has sentenced four people to a minimum of 16 1/2 years each behind bars for human trafficking, the Mexican attorney general's office said Tuesday, marking a rare conviction in a country struggling to get a grip on the illegal trade. The investigation began because of a tip from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, authorities said. Agents rescued four women being forced to work as prostitutes in Miami, Florida, according to a statement from the Mexican attorney general's office. An ICE spokeswoman said U.S. agents identified two of the victims in Miami and that the other two were identified by authorities in Mexico. Their children were being held in Tenancingo, a municipality in the southern Mexican state of Tlaxcala, and the women's contact with them was conditioned on their sending money to their handlers, the statement said. On June 7, 2010, Mexican authorities raided the home in Tlaxcala, arresting the four suspects. Fausto Velazquez Zompantzi, Jaime Velazquez Zompantzi and Severiana Zompantzi Rojas were sentenced to 16 1/2 years in prison each for the parts they played in the crime. Jorge Velazquez Zompantzi was sentenced to 18 1/2 years. In addition to trafficking, he was also found guilty of possessing a firearm licensed exclusively to the military. The women's children were sent to be with their mothers in the United States, according to the attorney general's office. The statement said the case represents the first time the attorney general's office of the Special Prosecutor for Organized Crime, also known as SIEDO, obtained a conviction and sentence for a human trafficking crime. Mexico, like many countries, struggles to investigate, prosecute and punish trafficking offenders. The U.S. State Department released its 2011 report on human trafficking Monday, assessing efforts by 184 governments worldwide to fight sexual exploitation, forced labor and moder-day slavery. The annual report, considered one of the most comprehensive analyses of worldwide human trafficking, ranks countries in three ""tiers."" Mexico was put in the middle tier. Notably, the reported cited the municipality of Tenancingo as a major source for Mexican sex trafficking victims exploited within Mexico and in the United States. Women, children, indigenous people and undocumented migrants are especially vulnerable, the report read. While noting some of the recent strides made by the Mexican government in countering trafficking, particularly at the federal level, the study also cited reports that some local law enforcement officials tolerate and are sometimes complicit in the illegal trade. ""Given the magnitude of Mexico's trafficking problem ... the number of human trafficking investigations, prosecutions, convictions, and sentences remained low, and government funding for victim services remained inadequate,"" it read. The State Department says 27 million people are victims of human trafficking worldwide, and approximately 100,000 of those victims are in the United States.","The investigation started with with a tip from ICE, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Real estate mogul and television celebrity Donald Trump, who generated a media publicity blitz by saying he might run for president in 2012, announced Monday that he will instead remain a businessman. ""After considerable deliberation and reflection, I have decided not to pursue the office of the presidency,"" Trump said in a statement. With his typical bravado, Trump maintained that he would have won the Republican primary and the general election, but recognized that ""running for public office cannot be done half-heartedly."" RNC chairman: ""It's his choice"" | Was he ever serious? ""Ultimately, however, business is my greatest passion and I am not ready to leave the private sector,"" Trump said in the statement. Trump's flirtation with running for the Republican nomination included his demand that President Barack Obama make public his full birth certificate from Hawaii. Mike Huckabee takes himself out of contention . Obama previously had provided a shorter version that serves as the public record in Hawaii, but amid the media glare on the issue raised in part by Trump's repeated questioning of whether the so-called long version of the document existed, the president released it last month.","The business mogul says he wants to remain in the private sector .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Toyota announced Thursday it was testing all its SUVs after it suspended worldwide sales of the Lexus GX 460 because of a reported risk of rollover. The carmaker does not plan to suspend the sales of other vehicles it's testing, said Ririko Takeuchi, a spokeswoman. But it will suspend Lexus GX 460 sales. Testing will include current models of Toyota's Rav4, FJ Cruiser, Highlander, 4Runner, Sequoia, Land Cruiser and Sienna, said Paul Nolasco, a Toyota spokesman in Tokyo. ""Toyota is testing not only the GX, but other SUVs simply because we want to make sure everything is right for our customers. Customer safety is our top priority,"" Nolasco said. ""There has been no indication there would be any problem in the other vehicles, so, for the time being as soon as we have results of those tests, including the test of the GX, we'll be sure to make those public."" Is Toyota 'moving forward' as its tagline says? Suspension of GX 460 sales is another blow on the automaker, which recalled about 8 million vehicles earlier this year because of multiple problems. Consumer Reports magazine warned readers Tuesday not to buy the GX 460 because it could flip over in hard turns. Shortly after the magazine issued its warning, Toyota announced it was suspending sales of the luxury vehicle in the United States and Canada. Toyota spokeswoman Mieko Iwasaki said Thursday that the company was expanding the suspension to the Middle East and Russia, the only other markets where it was sold. ""We have no specific target in mind when to resume the sales,"" she said. ""We are now investigating the case by trying to replicate the situation that Consumer Reports pointed out."" Consumer Reports said it judged the 2010 model to be a safety risk after a problem cropped up during standard emergency-handling tests. ""When pushed to its limits on our track's handling course, the rear of the GX we bought slid out until the vehicle was almost sideways before the electronic stability control system was able to regain control,"" the magazine reported. ""We believe that in real-world driving, that situation could lead to a rollover accident, which could cause serious injury or death. We are not aware, however, of any such reports."" The editors said their concern about rollover risk was magnified because the vehicle has a high center of gravity. The magazine urged owners to drive carefully when exiting the highway or driving on twisty roads while the carmaker prepares a software update for the stability-control system. Toyota put total sales at 5,400 in North America, 400 in the Middle East and 140 in Russia. In its response, Toyota said its engineers conducted similar tests and found no such issues. Edmunds.com lists the price for a new 2010 Lexus GX 460 as beginning at $51,970. -- CNN's Patty Lane contributed to this report.","NEW: Toyota tests all SUVs .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuba is launching its own version of Wikipedia Tuesday with an online encyclopedia that describes the United States as the ""empire of our time."" The site EcuRed, at www.ecured.cu , already has nearly 20,000 entries. One of the longest is about former leader Fidel Castro, the founder of the Cuban Revolution. EcuRed was up Monday and early Tuesday ahead of its official launch, but appeared to be down later in the day, apparently because of too much traffic. According to the site, its goal ""is the accumulation and development of knowledge with a non-profit, pro-democracy aim from a decolonizing point of view."" Users approved by EcuRed administrators will be able to update entries, and the site will be available to all Internet users in Cuba -- an estimated 1.6 million out of a population of 11.2 million.

"(CNN) -- The night before she was killed on the streets of Tehran, the woman the world would come to know simply as Neda had a dream. ""There was a war going on,"" she told her mom the next morning, ""and I was in the front."" Neda's mother had joined her in the street protests that erupted after Iran's disputed June 12 presidential election. But on that fateful morning, she told her daughter she couldn't go with her. As Neda prepared to leave, the mother was filled with anxiety. ""I told her to be very careful, and she said she would."" More than four months after Neda's death, her mother, Hajar Rostami, described the pain her family has endured and how grateful they are to millions across the world who have hailed Neda as a martyr -- a symbol of freedom for Iran. She spoke with CNN by phone in her native Farsi from her home in Tehran a few days ago. ""As a message to everyone, I really want to thank the whole world,"" she said. ""And I don't really know how to thank them, so I ask of you: Please find the right words for me. ""I can't tell you how much it has warmed our hearts, how much it's helped us."" There is a Farsi expression that describes a grieving person's need to talk about the pain in her heart, to empty her soul. And that's what this is: a mourning mother who for months has wept and cried -- and remained silent about her daughter's killing, until now. ""This is a pain that will never heal,"" she said in a gentle, hushed tone. Watch mom mourn the ""look in her eyes"" 'I need not worry' On June 20, Neda Agha-Soltan, 26, headed to Tehran's Nilofar Square, where thousands of protesters gathered. Clashes were particularly intense that day, with demonstrators and riot police squaring off. Neda, accompanied by her music teacher, called home with frequent updates. ""Mom, there are just too many clashes going on. There are a lot of police and forces around."" Tear gas was lobbed at the crowd. Neda headed to a medical clinic to get her eyes washed. ""My eyes are really burning hard,"" she said. Twenty minutes later, Neda's mom reached her again. ""She said she was on her way back home -- that I need not worry."" Neda told the same thing to her aunt and uncle, who also called to check up on her. Wearing blue jeans, a black shirt and white sneakers, Neda walked toward her car, parked on a side street not far from the heated protests. ""It didn't occur to her that anything was going to be different,"" her mother said. Then, Neda was killed. A single bullet struck her chest. Recalling that day, her mother paused in the hourlong interview. The family, she said, has gone back to the scene and retraced Neda's movements. ""She was only 26 steps from her car."" Those were 26 steps Neda never had a chance to take -- the difference between returning home to her family and becoming a symbol of a greater struggle inside Iran. 'She was absolutely beautiful' While millions across the globe were transfixed by Neda's death, captured on video, her family entered a traditional seven-day grieving period. Her parents' house was too small to host everyone; they gathered at Neda's older sister's home. The family, Neda's mother said, was barred from holding a memorial service. ""I did see Neda when her body was being washed before burial,"" she said. ""When her body was covered in the white shroud for burial, when they uncovered her face, I saw her. She was absolutely beautiful -- with a smile, a beautiful smile. Like an angel."" It was during the seven days of mourning, around the third or fourth day, that a relative told her about the video of Neda's death, by then widely watched on the Internet. The mother didn't watch it that first week. ""But when I returned home, I did see the video,"" she said. ""It was enormously painful. So painful that I've never been able to watch it again all the way through to the end. ""It was the moment of seeing her give her life, the life leaving her body. That was very painful. The look in her eyes at that moment. I wake up with that look in her eyes every morning; I go to bed with the image of that look in her eyes every evening."" She continued, ""I want to say that the moment that bothers me the most -- that bothers me terribly -- is the moment Neda got shot. That's because Neda was an extremely brave person. Ever since she was a child, she was brave and fearless. So that moment when she got shot, I saw it in the video, she couldn't believe it -- that she had taken a bullet. So much so that she takes a look at her body. And when she sees she's been shot, she takes a few steps backwards and then falls. The only words she managed to utter was: 'Teacher, I'm burning.' And people said she passed within 44 seconds."" The mother visits Neda's grave every Friday. She's heartened that even now, throngs of people still greet her -- ""It's as though she just passed away."" She carries with her a painting of her smiling daughter that she received as a gift. ""People go and write on her grave in red ink the word 'martyr,'"" she said, ""and then the authorities go and wipe it off."" Blog: Behind the scenes with Neda's mom . She said her daughter's killer is still at large, but she's confident the person will be found and tried in court. ""I am waiting for that day."" ""I saw Neda as a martyr from the start. Neda was a martyr for her homeland."" A 'caring' debater . Long before Neda became a household name, she was a ""very excited girl"" who always had answers for everything. ""She was very well tempered and very friendly and very emotional and caring -- extremely emotional and caring,"" her mother said. ""She was never the type of girl who would submit to force."" In their last face-to-face conversation, the mother and daughter debated the political climate inside Iran. ""We had a hearty debate and discussion,"" her mother said. Neda's favorite activity was aerobics. She also liked to sunbathe at a local swimming pool. Her final meal was her favorite dish: pan kabob. Neda was divorced, her mother said. After the divorce, Neda tried to get a job, but it was impossible. Every time she went for interviews or filled out an application, she felt people looked at her differently. ""So she decided she was going to stay home."" That home is now adorned with photographs of Neda. One of her last gifts to her mom was perfume, a birthday present she cherishes. ""On a daily basis, when I want to think of her, I can't tell you how hard it is. It's too hard to be able to speak."" Neda, the middle of three children, shared her room with her younger brother. He played guitar and violin. Neda loved the piano, and wanted him to learn to play. Just days before she was killed, she picked out a piano for him. He has since purchased it. ""When he comes home from work every evening,"" the mother said, ""he plays the piano and sings in Neda's memory. And that's what keeps us going every evening."" She hopes the people of Iran and the world will hear her story -- Neda's story -- and never forget her daughter. ""I just want to thank you for remembering her. It's that which stays with me, and it's her eyes, the look in her eyes in those last moments that had a story to tell that I can never forget,"" she said. ""Neda has made me enormously proud."" It is tradition in Iran to give away personal belongings of a loved one after they die. But Neda's bed, her makeup stand, her photographs -- everything that was hers -- remains untouched. The reason: Neda appeared in her sister's dream and told her not to part with anything. ""I am alive,"" Neda said.","Neda's mom speaks to CNN from Tehran, thanks world for rallying behind her daughter .

"(CNN) -- Wajeha al-Huwaider picked up her passport, got in a taxi, and headed from her home in eastern Saudi Arabia to the nearby island kingdom of Bahrain -- a 45-minute drive that many Saudis take to get away for the weekend. Wajeha al-Huwaider says women face too many controls in Saudi Arabia. Despite having a valid passport, Saudi authorities at the border sent al-Huwaider home. That's because in Saudi Arabia, a woman needs permission from her male guardian before she can leave the country. Al-Huwaider -- a vocal women's rights activist in Saudi Arabia -- knew before she left that she would be turned away at the border. Her attempted trip was simply to make a point about the Saudi guardianship system that she says ""controls all aspects of women's lives."" ""Either you treat us like mature citizens or let us leave the country (permanently),"" she told CNN. She's urging all Saudi women who are tired of ""being oppressed"" to go ""to any border and try to cross it without permission from their male relative."" She wants to end Saudi Arabia's strict guardianship laws in which women must get permission from their husband, father, or closest male relative before doing the most mundane of tasks -- including working outside the home, going to school, maintaining a bank account, or leaving the country for a weekend getaway. Saudi Arabia is conflicted when it comes to women's rights. Women are not allowed to vote or drive, but earlier this year Saudi King Abdullah appointed Nora al-Fayez as the kingdom's first female deputy minister of education as part of a massive Cabinet reshuffling. Many consider Abdullah to be a reformer and the move was hailed within Saudi Arabia as a great step forward for women's rights. But al-Huwaider sees it differently, claiming even a woman as powerful as al-Fayez ""isn't really in control of her life."" ""If she wants to travel is not up to her, it's up to her male guardian,"" she said. Human Rights Watch has criticized the Saudi government for not living up to commitments it made to the United Nations Human Rights Council. HRW issued a report last year detailing the negative impact of the guardianship system on Saudi women. It said Saudi officials have asserted that such guardianship requirements do not exist. ""The Saudi government is saying one thing to the Human Rights Council in Geneva but doing another thing inside the kingdom,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, HRW's Middle East director. ""It needs to stop requiring adult women to seek permission from men, not just pretend to stop it."" Efforts to reach the Saudi government for comment were unsuccessful. HRW issued a report last year detailing the negative impact of the guardianship system on Saudi women. It said Saudi officials have asserted that such guardianship requirements do not exist. Last month, al-Huwaider tried three times to cross from Saudi Arabia into Bahrain on her own and without permission from a male guardian. She was turned back each time but she said she'll continue going to Saudi's land borders and its airports in an attempt to gain ""her rights."" She has even protested on the side of a major road, the King Fahd Causeway that connects Saudi Arabia to Bahrain. Al-Huwaider insists this campaign is different from previous ones she's been involved in. ""It's not about just sending messages and petitions anymore,"" she said. ""We're not going to send any letters to anyone. Saudi women have to find someone who will take them to an airport or a border and say that they don't approve of the system and that they want to leave."" She said that her mission is more than just an act of civil disobedience. ""Most of the people think I'm doing it just to allow women to travel without permission,"" says Al-Huwaider. ""But I keep telling women that it's the whole system that needs to be changed.""","Wajeha al-Huwaider says Saudi guardianship system is too restrictive for women .

"(CNN) -- Singapore's ruling party was returned to power in general elections Saturday, despite the strongest challenge to date from the opposition. The People's Action Party, in power since 1959, won 81 seats, while the opposition Workers' Party took six, according to the Elections Department. Saturday's voting in general elections were to determine 82 seats of the incoming parliament; five seats were already decided as that slate ran unopposed in one district. The economy took center stage in the election in the Asian city-state. Many voters said they were worried about the relatively high cost of living and the rise of low-wage immigrant workers. Singapore is a prosperous nation but it remains an authoritarian nation with curbs on freedom of expression, assembly and association. Political activities are tightly controlled by the government, according to human rights monitoring groups. A record 2.2 million people are eligible to vote, many for the first time, the government-backed Straits Times newspaper reported.

"San Bruno, California (CNN) -- Firefighters have fully contained a massive gas-fueled blaze in California that killed four people, while search efforts and attempts to determine the cause of the fire were still under way on Friday. The fire triggered by a ruptured natural gas transmission line sent giant fireballs shooting 80 feet into the air in a quiet neighborhood of San Bruno, near the San Francisco airport. ""It looks like a moonscape in some areas,"" said San Bruno Fire Chief Dennis Haag, who was visibly shaken at a news conference. Scorched homes and the shells of burned-out cars lined charred streets as firefighters battled hot spots and residents clamored to know the cause of their town's devastation. By Friday afternoon, the fire was reported to be fully contained. iReport: Lone fireman fights flames . California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado said he was shocked by the ""horrible tragedy."" ""It looks like a bomb went off,"" he said. ""I saw debris everywhere. It was a huge explosion."" ""Our hearts go out to those impacted by this horrible disaster,"" said Maldonado. ""Without warning many of these peoples' lives have been changed forever and my deepest prayers go out to everyone."" He said ""we will find out soon"" what caused the fire that erupted after 6 p.m. Thursday after a gas transmission line broke and triggered an explosion. Maldonado also told reporters on Friday he had received a telephone call from President Barack Obama, who offered his support. iReport: Another view of the fire . Four people are known to have died in the fire, the lieutenant governor said. Another 52 people were injured, including three patients who were taken to a hospital with third-degree burns and four firefighters who suffered from smoke inhalation. Rescue workers initially feared the death toll would climb higher as they combed through the smoldering scene with cadaver dogs. But by Friday evening, no one in the area was unaccounted for and local fire officials had not received reports of any missing people, according to Haag. He said about 100 people had evacuated to shelters. Blasts, fireballs and quake-like rumbles . Search efforts were roughly 95 percent complete. The remaining 5 percent was still too hot to enter, the fire chief added. Pacific Gas and Electric Company President Chris Johns said Friday that the ruptured gas transmission line had been secured and no more gas is flowing through it. He said survey teams are walking house to house to ""make sure it is safe"" for residents to return, and he promised that the company will be transparent in working with federal investigators to learn the cause of the blast. The National Transportation and Safety Board launched an investigation Friday. Safety questions raised . ""At this point, it's too early to speculate as to what may have happened,"" NTSB Vice Chairman Christopher Hart told reporters. He said a team of investigators was working on scene to determine probable cause. The group's findings will be put into a report that may not be ready for as many as 18 months, Hart said. PG&E's Johns said he had heard accounts of residents complaining of the smell of gas for the past three weeks and the company was looking into whether any phone calls had come in. ""We are really saddened and sorry about this tragedy and we are going to do everything we can to help the folks who have been affected by this,"" he said. The fire destroyed 37 homes and damaged eight, California Emergency Management Agency Secretary Matthew Bettenhausen told reporters. Those numbers were considerably lower than the estimate of roughly 170 homes that NTSB's Hart said were affected by the blaze. The fire was about 50 percent contained four hours after it began, Haag said. But the intense, persistent flames made it difficult for crews to get close. Gas pipes near homes, windy weather and water supply problems also complicated efforts to combat the flames. iReport: Ground level view of fire . ""The radiant heat from the actual gas and the fireball was making it so that they couldn't even attack the homes that were on fire,"" said news photographer Bryan Carmody, who arrived at the scene shortly after the blaze began. Water pressure in the area was low because the fire compromised a water main, California state Sen. Leland Yee told CNN affiliate KRON, so firefighters had to truck in water. James Ruane, the mayor of San Bruno, said he talked to survivors of the blaze to assure them that the city will help them. He said he could tell how much the incident affected them. ""It was the look on their faces. They were still in shock,"" he said. ""They were walking around but almost in a daze. It must have been horrific when it happened."" Tim Gutierrez, who lives in a neighborhood near where the blast occurred, told CNN affiliate KRON that people living in the area have smelled natural gas for the past three weeks. iReport: Video and photos of the fire . ""Every day after work, I would smell the heavy smell coming from the gutter and sewer,"" he said. Asked about that account Thursday night, Haag told reporters it was ""the first time the fire department's ever had any notice of it."" Maldonado declared a state of emergency in San Mateo County. The fire erupted in a populated area about two miles west of San Francisco International Airport. All flights and operations there were normal Friday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. CNN's Dan Simon, Catherine E. Shoichet, Ninette Sosa, Shawn Nottingham, Anderson Cooper, Karan Olson, Sonya Hamasaki, Deanna Proeller, Greg Morrison, Scott Thompson, Amanda Watts and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Gas fire now fully contained with home hot spots .

"Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, a career civil servant who has advised eight presidents over four decades, turned to his wife at the Pentagon's official farewell ceremony Thursday and said ""Becky, we're really going home this time."" Gates' promise to his wife was a not-so-subtle reference to his track record of leaving Washington and then reluctantly coming back or staying longer than planned. Now he's really leaving -- for his retirement home across the country in Washington state. Most recently, as the President George W. Bush's second term was ending, Gates made several comments about having a clock in his office counting down the days until he could leave Washington when Bush left office. But after President Barack Obama persuaded him to stay, he said he threw the clock away. He became the first secretary of defense to serve presidents of both parties, and Obama said Thursday, ""It's clear you have been one of the best."" The Department of Defense displayed a surplus of pomp and circumstance for the ceremony on the parade ground just outside the secretary's office windows. On the day before, crews were busy pressure-washing the stone stairs that Gates and company would use to come and go from the ceremony. And the various military honor guard units were busy rehearsing the precise marching and drills for the ceremony. Each of the armed services sent an honor guard unit and flag bearers to the event. The Army sent its ""Pershing's Own"" band as well as its Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps in their Colonial-era uniforms, compete with white wigs and three-corner hats. Of course, some things are out of the U.S. military's control. The heat of a blazing sun was mitigated only by a frequent breeze and unseasonably low humidity. Still, one member of the U.S. Army Band, apparently feeling the effects of the sun as she stood there in her blue wool tunic, calmly stepped out of formation, walked to the one corner of the parade ground with any shade and sat down. By the end of the event she was back on her feet and appeared fine. (Note to the U.S. Navy, today is perfect example of why your tradition of wearing lightweight, all-white, cotton/polyester blend  uniforms on hot days is very smart move.) Then there were the planes -- passenger jets taking off every minute or so from Reagan National Airport and flying right over the parade ground. While the 19-gun salute could be heard over the noise, the roar of the engines frequently drowned out the president, Gates and even the officer who read the official citation for the Presidential Medal of Freedom that President Obama awarded Gates -- the one surprise event of the day. Gates purposely tried keep from becoming emotional, choosing to send the troops in the field a heartfelt farewell Wednesday by e-mail. But he still took time to remember them as he left office. ""I will think of these young warriors -- the ones who fought, the ones who keep on fighting, the ones who never made it back -- till the end of my days,"" Gates said. Perhaps the feelings of the people who have worked under Gates for 4 1/2 years was best summed up by a civilian DoD bureaucrat sitting in the heat at Thursday's ceremony: ""I'm gonna miss this guy,"" the worker said.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility Thursday for a suicide bombing outside a police station in northwestern Pakistan that left at least 25 people dead, saying it was part of a series of attacks to avenge the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. In a phone call to CNN, Taliban spokesman Ihsan Ullah Ihsan said Pakistani security forces and government officials are killing innocent mujahedeen and ""we will take revenge from them by killing their loved ones, as we did in Thursday's attack."" At least 56 people were injured in the explosion, which happened near local law-enforcement and court buildings, said Abdul Rasheed, the police chief of Hangu district.  The district is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, not far from the border with Afghanistan. The suicide bomber blew himself up in a car, said Masood Khan Afridi, a senior police official in Hangu. Pakistani Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani ""strongly condemned"" the attack, according to a statement from his office. ""The prime minister, while reiterating the government's resolve to fight the terrorist elements until their complete elimination, said that those targeting the innocent people are in fact the enemies of humanity,"" the statement said. ""They... have no regard for the human life or creed as they are following their own nefarious agenda."" Gilani called on the population to unify and ""defeat these anti-state elements,"" the statement said, adding that the prime minister also directed law enforcement to mount a rigorous investigation into the attack. A team of U.S. Navy SEALs raided bin Laden's compound and killed him May 2 in Abbottabad, Pakistan.  Several al Qaeda-affiliated groups have vowed to launch attacks in retaliation.

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities have rescued six undocumented Cuban migrants who had been held for ransom for a month in Cancun, a vacation hotspot on the nation's Yucatan Peninsula, the state-run Notimex news agency reported Wednesday. The abductors, who were not apprehended in Tuesday night's rescue, were seeking between $8,000 and $10,000 from relatives in Florida for each of the five men and one woman they had been holding in a series of safe houses, Notimex said. The Cubans said they arrived in Cancun on a raft and were picked up from the streets of Cancun by men in a pickup truck, the news service said. The Yucatan Peninsula, particularly the municipalities of Cancun, Isla Mujeres and Cozumel, is a major landing point for smugglers who bring Cubans into Mexico and take them to the U.S. border. ""It's a major receiving dock for things coming from the Caribbean,"" said Samuel Logan, founding director of Southern Pulse, an online information network focused on Latin America. ""It's a pretty important reception point."" Human smugglers charge up to $10,000 per person to transport them by boat from Cuba, usually from the westernmost province of Pinar del Rios, and then overland in Mexico to the U.S. border. Mexican and Cuban officials estimate that up to 10,000 Cubans are smuggled into Mexico each year, the online Diario de Cuba publication said Wednesday. The Cancun area has become more popular with human smugglers in the past decade because the 135-mile-wide Yucatan Channel is not heavily patrolled by the U.S. Coast Guard as other parts of the Caribbean Sea. Most U.S. interdiction efforts occur in the Straits of Florida between Cuba and Florida. Cuban smugglers have been working with drug-trafficking organizations in the Yucatan area, particularly the Beltran-Leyva and Zetas cartels, authorities say. Lately, officials say, the Cuban smugglers have been branching out into trafficking cocaine from Colombia. The Noticaribe online publication said in November that a group of Cuban migrants had reported being tortured in Cancun by abductors who demanded $10,000 from family in Miami, Florida. Of the 34 killings in the Cancun area in 2007, Noticaribe said, many of them were Cubans involved in human trafficking. Tuesday's rescue of the six Cubans came one week after Mexican authorities discovered the bodies of 72 migrants from Central and South America on a ranch in Tamaulipas state. Officials are investigating whether the Zetas cartel killed the migrants and for what reason. It's possible the migrants refused to work for the cartel or were unable to obtain ransom money. ""Sometimes the Mexican organized crime group says, 'The hell with it. We're not going to deal with these people,' and they kill them all,"" Logan said. Elements from the Mexican navy, army and state and local police made Tuesday's rescue of the six Cubans after authorities received a telephone tip. The hostages said they were guarded at their last house by three abductors, two Mexicans and a Cuban. The Cubans ranged in age from 22 to 46 years old, Notimex said, and were identified as Lazaro Hernandez Albeja, Eusebio Galaz Sabrino, Dandy Acosta, Edel Eime Gama, Daniel Cardo Rodriguez and Suramy Acosta Camber. In Mexico, human smuggling is a $15 billion- to $20 billion-a-year endeavor, second only to drug trafficking, Logan said. That money, which used to go mostly to smugglers, now also flows into the hands of drug cartel members. The drug-trafficking organizations charge the smugglers a price per person for the right to cross over their territory, a practice called ""derecho de piso,"" or right of passage. Or they often abduct the migrants and hold them for ransom. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan, nonprofit policy institute based in Washington, noted in an August report that human smuggling and other illegal activities are playing an increasingly important role as narcotraffickers diversify their activities. ""The drug cartels have not confined themselves to selling narcotics,"" the report said. ""They engage in kidnapping for ransom, extortion, human smuggling and other crimes to augment their incomes."" Some cartels have come to rely more in recent years on human smuggling. ""For the Zetas, it's been one of their main revenue streams for years,"" Logan said about the vicious cartel, which operates mostly in northeastern Mexico.","Abductors wanted between $8,000 to $10,000 for each Cuban from relatives in Florida .

"(CNN) -- What price love -- or more accurately, what price a love letter? When it comes to such letters written by a teenage Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, that price is $134,500, according to the auctioneer Christie's. And if you like happy endings, it was ""a French lady"" -- perhaps appropriately enough -- who paid that amount Thursday and is now the owner of 22 letters and a printed telegram authored by Onassis, said Christie's spokeswoman Sung-Hee Park in New York City. The letters, which Onassis sent to her then-boyfriend at Harvard in the late 1940s, were valued between $25,000 and $35,000 prior to the auction, held Thursday morning, Park said. The letters were written before Onassis met her future husband and future president John F. Kennedy, who also studied at Harvard. ""The buyer bought it over the phone, and they just wanted to be identified as a French lady who is a very big fan of Jackie Kennedy,"" Park told CNN. ""It's always great when a piece of art goes for the estimate, but when something goes much higher than the estimate, it's a great surprise."" The letters reveal the personality of the future first lady on the matters of adolescent love, kissing and a loathing of attending a finishing school. The auction house described the writings as ""the earliest Jackie Kennedy letters,"" displaying ""a funny, spirited, at times cynical young woman, but one with great intelligence and a strong will of her own."" In a letter dated October 10, 1946, the 17-year-old Miss Bouvier reveals her ""cooling enthusiasm"" in a letter to Harvard boyfriend R. Beverley Corbin Jr., ""who seems to have been badly hurt when Jackie refused to kiss him during one visit,"" according to Christie's. Corbin was 21 at the time. Corbin's son, Bev, of New York, owned the letters and put them up for auction, he told CNN. ""I do love you though -- and can love you without kissing you every time I see you and I hope you understand that,"" Onassis declares. Then, on January 20, 1947, she writes to her boyfriend about her definition of true love. ""I've always thought of being in love as being willing to do anything for the other person -- starve to buy them bread and not mind living in Siberia with them -- and I've always thought that every minute away from them would be hell -- so looking at it that (way) I guess I'm not in love with you,"" Onassis writes. Her last letter to him is undated, and it announces her engagement to John Husted. ""What I hope for you,"" she writes Corbin, ""is for the same thing to happen as quickly and as surely as it did with me. It will when you least expect it."" But that ill-fated engagement to Husted lasted only a few months in 1951, according to Christie's. Onassis died in 1994 in New York as one of the world's most famous women. She was 64. In an extraordinary life marked by staggering tragedy, she was the widowed first lady of Kennedy, assassinated in 1963, and became a widow again, of Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, who died in 1975. Corbin died in 2004 at age 79, according to the Social Security death Index. The 75 pages of letters were written between 1945 and 1951 on personal stationery and the letterhead of Miss Porter's School, but in the letters, Onassis calls Porter's finishing school ""prison."" ""If school days are the happiest of your life, I'm hanging myself with my skip-rope tonight,"" the teenage Onassis writes to her boyfriend. In another letter, she pens of an upcoming Christmas break, when ""I can commute happily back and forth between my doting parents until they both get sick of me."" In an October 3, 1946, letter, she jokes about her schooling. ""I'm never going to send my children to boarding school,"" she writes. ""The boys can go to P.S. 148 with gangsters, and then go to Columbia & the girls can go to Hunter College and they'll all be morons but at least they wont have to tear around and get their teeth knocked out playing hockey every day. ... Can you think of anything worse than living in a small town like this all your life and competing to see which housewife could bake the best cake?"" The finishing school was in Farmington, Connecticut, a town where Corbin had resided at one time, a Christie's spokeswoman said. Onassis displays a mischievous side in a February 12, 1947, letter in which she tells Corbin to smuggle in cigarettes, chocolate ""and a hip flask to shock Mrs. J."" Many of the letters begin with ""Dearest Bev"" or ""Buddy darling,"" and one envelope, sent via ""air mail"" with three 3-cent stamps, is addressed to ""Mr. R. Beverley Corbin Jr."" of ""The Owl Club"" at Harvard University. The sale included an undated black-and-white photograph of Onassis and Corbin along with another couple.","Jackie Kennedy Onassis's love letters were written when she was a teen .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A rare inter-Korean meeting ended prematurely Wednesday with no progress. North Korea told the South to ""go back"" according to Lee Jong-Joo, a spokeswoman for South Korea's Unification Ministry, insisting they would not talk with anyone from the government itself. A delegation of twelve South Korean government officials and businessmen crossed the border into North Korea's Kumgang tourist resort to try to resolve a dispute over South Korean assets there.  The joint project was started in 1998 to boost reconciliation and give North Korea a chance to earn money. Seoul suspended tours in 2008 after a South Korean tourist was shot dead by a North Korean soldier after walking into an off-limit area. The last discussion at the Mount Kumgang resort was in April 2010 but that did not include government officials.  Pyongyang said last month it will cut off all ties with the government in Seoul, and it refuses to talk to anyone in President Lee Myung-Bak's administration.","North tells delegation from the South to ""go back""

"(CNN) -- After an eventful first term marked by humanitarian crises, a global recession and the Arab Spring, Ban Ki-moon announced Monday his intention to seek a second five-year stint as the United Nations' secretary-general. Ban voiced his hope of staying in place at a news conference Monday in New York, where the United Nations is headquartered, hours after sending letters to members of the U.N. General Assembly and Security Council. ""It has been an enormous privilege to lead this great organization,"" Ban said. ""If supported by the member states, I would be deeply honored to serve once more."" Four and a half years earlier, in October 2006, the former South Korean foreign minister was elected by the 192-member U.N. General Assembly to succeed Kofi Annan. This vote followed a straw poll days earlier in which 14 of 15 members -- with one having no opinion -- of the U.N. Security Council recommended Ban, then-Chinese Ambassador Wang Guangya said. He is the world body's eighth secretary-general and the first from Asia since U Thant, from what is now Myanmar, who served from 1961 to 1971. Upon his election, Ban indicated that ending violence in the Sudanese region of Darfur and tackling climate change were among his top priorities. There has been progress on both fronts, including a recent vote to create an independent state in southern Sudan and evolving negotiated frameworks to address global warming, though significant challenges remain. Ban has also found himself and the United Nations at the forefront of many crises that few anticipated in 2006. The past year, especially, has been tumultuous given the massive earthquake, tsunami and subsequent nuclear crisis in Japan; the wave of popular unrest in the Arab world; and the continued fallout from the ongoing global economic crisis. The secretary-general addressed all these issues, as well as long-standing priorities such as nuclear disarmament, the Middle East peace process and fighting AIDS and other global health maladies, on Monday. ""These 4½ years have been marked by extraordinary challenge for the United Nations and the international community,"" he said. ""We can be proud of what we've accomplished together."" Saying he has sought to be a ""bridge builder"" who seeks to find ""common ground,"" Ban has had few public adversaries over his first term and is expected to easily win re-election. A top diplomat for one U.N. state, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, called Ban's intention to seek a second term ""very good news."" ""The U.N. and the international community can rely upon him, his very solid experience and his authority,"" Juppe said in a statement, adding that Ban ""has worked unstintingly for peace, as well as development, on behalf of the United Nations. He has shown courage and determination in a period of crisis.""","Ban Ki-moon sent letters to U.N. members noting his intent to run for re-election .

"(CNN) -- The European Union on Wednesday agreed to pay 210 million euros ($307 million) to farmers who suffered losses due to the E.coli outbreak that has killed at least 25 people, mostly in Germany. The figure is up considerably from the 150 million euros EU agriculture officials proposed Tuesday, and Dacion Ciolos, the EU's agriculture commissioner, said that figure may change again. ""This envelope will enable us to respond to the compensation requests for the period from the 26th of May through to the end of June,"" Ciolos said. ""We will then take stock of the situation and see whether we need to adjust these figures."" Farmers in several European countries are seeking to be paid back for losses they suffered after being wrongly blamed for the outbreak. Farmers who grow cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, zucchini and lettuce will be eligible to receive up to 50 percent of the average market price they would have received, based on figures from 2008-2010, the EU said. Some producers could get up to 70 percent of market prices when funds from EU-supported producer organizations are included, Ciolos said. The planned settlement still needs to be accepted by EU member states on June 14, Ciolos said. Spain alone has sought more than 400 million euros ($600 million) in lost farm exports of cucumbers, tomatoes and other produce from the past few weeks, and farmers in Belgium, France, Holland and even Germany say they have millions in losses, too. The death toll from the outbreak rose to 25 on Wednesday as German health authorities confirmed two more E.coli fatalities there. All but one of the 25 were in Germany, while the remaining victim died in Sweden after a having visited Germany. Local officials in the German state of Lower Saxony said another man, aged 73, also died, but he had other health problems as well, so they are not certain his death was due to E. coli. There are a total 2,648 cases of E. coli infection in Germany, according to the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's top health authority. But Health Minister Daniel Bahr said Wednesday the number of new cases of infection has been falling significantly. There have also been a handful of infections in a dozen other European countries, but they appear to be linked to northern Germany. The cause of the 10-day-old crisis still has not been conclusively identified. There was no trace of E. coli in a pack of bean sprouts in a household in Hamburg, where a man had become infected, health authorities there told CNN Tuesday. The sprouts came from the farm which officials believe could be the source of the outbreak. But initial tests showed no sign of E. coli there, agriculture officials in the German state of Lower Saxony said Monday. But authorities said that does not mean their suspicions were wrong; they would not expect to find evidence of E. coli if the tainted sprouts were no longer in the supply chain. And Wednesday, Lower Saxony agriculture officials said three workers at the suspect farm had diarrhea in early May and at least one has been diagnosed with the dangerous strain of E.coli. Authorities have also found that a cafeteria in the town of Cuxhaven, where 18 people came down with the infection, had also received sprouts from the farm in question, said  Natascha Manski, a spokeswoman for the state agriculture ministry. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin and David Wilkinson in London contributed to this report.","NEW: EU agrees to 210 million euros to compensate farmers .

"New York (CNN) -- Building management told Manhattan apartment residents that it was not consulted before a leaserholder invited former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn to stay as a guest, according to an e-mail obtained Saturday by CNN. The general manager for 71 Broadway sent an e-mail informing residents that he has been assured that Strauss-Kahn ""will only be staying here until early next week."" Strauss-Kahn, who is awaiting a trial on sexual assault charges, was released on bail from the Rikers Island jail Friday. A private security guard will monitor Strauss-Kahn around the clock at his own expense during his stay at the Manhattan apartment in the financial district, a source with knowledge of the bail agreement said. Strauss-Kahn, who is accused of trying to rape a maid last week in his suite at the Sofitel hotel in New York, will stay with his wife, Anne Sinclair. ""We will have an increased staff presence in the building this weekend to ensure that the media, and the curious, are kept out of the building,"" the general manager wrote. ""We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience."" CNN obtained the e-mail from a resident of the building. A two-bedroom apartment with 9-foot ceilings in the landmark 23-floor building with a doorman starts at $4,250 per month, according to a real estate website. The rental application asks, ""Do you or do any of your occupants have charges pending against you or against them for any criminal offense(s)?"" Strauss-Kahn faces two counts of criminal sexual act; two counts of sexual abuse; and one count each of attempt to commit rape, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. In the charge of criminal sexual act in the first degree, Strauss-Kahn is accused of having ""engaged in oral sexual conduct with an individual ... by forcible compulsion,"" an indictment states. Supreme Court Judge Michael Obus ordered the release of the 62-year-old economist Friday over the objection of the prosecution, which said he is a flight risk. While Strauss-Kahn is in the apartment, he will not be able to leave except for medical reasons, Obus said. Once he is in a longer-term location, the former banker must give six hours' notice before leaving. Defense lawyer William Taylor alluded to Strauss-Kahn's reported failure to win approval to stay at another apartment in pleading Friday with members of the news media to grant his client privacy. ""The reason that he had to move is because members of the press attempted to invade his private residence and interfere with his family's privacy,"" Taylor said. The conditions of Strauss-Kahn's release included he surrender his travel documents, submit to home detention, $1 million cash bail and $5 million bond. A document signed by bondsman Ira Judelson shows that the bond was secured by money from Sinclair. Judelson would not divulge what Sinclair put up as collateral. ""I feel very comfortable with the bail package (and) the family is,"" Judelson told reporters. ""I worked with them all last night on putting this together. They're good people."" On Friday, more details emerged about the alleged attack May 14 at the hotel. A law enforcement source with knowledge of the case said a room service attendant entered the suite shortly before the 32-year-old Guinean maid arrived. The room service attendant didn't think anyone was in the suite of rooms and used a pass key to let himself in to retrieve some room-service items, the source said. He told police he left the door ajar while inside, according to the source. When the maid showed up at the door about noon, the room-service attendant told her to enter, then departed, the source said. Once inside, the maid parked her cleaning cart in the doorway, as dictated by hotel policy. A short time later, Strauss-Kahn emerged naked from a room and attacked her, the victim has alleged. Prosecutors allege that Strauss-Kahn chased her through his suite, sexually assaulted her and tried to rape her. A criminal complaint states Strauss-Kahn shut the door at one point during the alleged attack. The law enforcement source said the maid escaped about 1:30 p.m. About an hour before his 4:40 p.m. flight was to take off from John F. Kennedy International Airport for Paris, Strauss-Kahn called the hotel to say he had left his cell phone. He asked security to look for it in his room and to have it delivered to the airport, the source said. By then, police had been called to the hotel. Though hotel staff never found the phone, they followed police orders, telling Strauss-Kahn they had found it and would deliver it to him, the source said. Port Authority police took over from there, walking a compliant Strauss-Kahn from his first-class seat to a squad car at the airport, the source said. At the time, Strauss-Kahn was in the fourth year of a five-year term with the global financial institution and was paid $441,980 in 2010, according to the most recent annual report. He also got $79,000 and first-class travel for him and his family while he was on company business. On Friday, the IMF said that Strauss-Kahn, who resigned, will receive a $250,000 separation payment and a ""modest annual pension"" thereafter. We don't disclose pension payments,"" IMF spokesman William Murray said. ""But it is well below the separation payment figure."" The dean of the IMF executive board, Shakour Shaalan, announced Friday that the institution adopted a procedure to select its next managing director. In a statement, Shaalan said the board will meet with final candidates in Washington ""with the objective of completing the selection process by June 30, 2011."" Strauss-Kahn proclaimed innocence in a resignation letter to the IMF Executive Board late Wednesday. ""To all, I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me,"" he said. His next court appearance is set for June 6.

"(CNN) -- Rajasthan Royals eased their way to an eight-wicket victory over the Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League on Saturday. South African spinner Johan Botha was the star with the bat, hitting eight fours and a six in an unbeaten 67 off just 47 balls as Rajasthan passed Deccan's total of 137 for eight with seven balls to spare at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. Botha, who was promoted to number three in the order, received good support from the veteran India batsman Rahul Dravid, who scored 28, while New Zealand's Ross Taylor chipped in with 21 not out. Put into bat by Rajasthan captain, Shane Warne, Deccan openers got off to a brisk start, but once Shikhar Dhawan and Ishank Jaggi were out, the runs dried up and wickets continued to fall with Siddharth Trivedi and Amit Singh claiming three victims each, while Warne bagged two. Australian Daniel Christian (26 runs) and Ravi Teja (28) boosted Deccan's run rate towards the end of the innings but it couldn't disguise a shortage of runs. Meanwhile, in the other IPL match played Saturday, the Bangalore Royal Challengers beat the Kochi Tuskers Kerala by six wickets at the Nehru Stadium, Kochi. An unbeaten half-century from South Africa's AB de Villiers helped the Challengers overhaul a Tuskers total of 161 for five with eight balls to spare. Earlier, New Zealand's Brendon McCullum and Indian legend VVS Laxman got the Tuskers off to a flier scoring at nearly 10-an-over until Laxman was out for 36 in the ninth over. McCullum followed two overs later for 45 from just 32 balls. A quickfire 27 from Australia's Brad Hodge and 23 not out from India's Ravindra Jadeja helped push the score past 150. But De Villiers' 54 was the star turn of the match. His 40-ball unbeaten innings included five sixes and gave his team the momentum at a crucial time in the match.","Shane Warne takes two wickets in a comfortable win over Deccan Chargers .

"(CNN) -- Nude photos and other potentially objectionable materials have been showing up in the iPhone application store in recent weeks, raising questions about Apple's ability to control iPhone content. An iPhone app called BeautyMeter was pulled from the app store after a nude photo surfaced. In the most recent example, a nude photo of a young woman, reported to be 15 years old, showed up on an iPhone application called ""BeautyMeter,"" according to Wired.com and Krapps.com, an app review site. CNN could not independently confirm the young woman's age. The photo, which apparently was submitted by one of the photo-sharing app's users, prompted Apple to remove the entire mobile application from its online store. Funnymals, maker of the BeautyMeter app, which lets users upload and posts photos of people and then rank them based on ""hotness,"" says in a statement on its Web site that it agrees with Apple's decision to yank the phone application from its online store. Funnymals also says its policies prohibit people from posting nude photos to the application. Neither Funnymals nor Apple responded to requests for comment. About a week earlier, another mobile phone application, ""Hottest Girl,"" showcased a photo of a topless woman and also was pulled from the iPhone app store. ""Apple will not distribute applications that contain inappropriate content, such as pornography,"" an Apple company spokesman said at the time. The explicit material is putting attention on Apple's attempts to filter out potentially objectionable apps before they're posted on its app store. The iPhone app store, with more than 50,000 applications, is the most popular entertainment and information venue of its kind for mobile phones. Observers say the successful app store buoys the iPhone's popularity and adds to Apple's sterling image as a hip and family-friendly company. The explicit content has the potential to tarnish that image. But Apple, like any company or Web site that hosts user-submitted content, may be engaged an impossible task by trying to keep all offensive material from the app store. Some iPhone apps are developed by Apple, but many are submitted for approval by third-party developers. Phil Malone, a clinical professor of law at Harvard Law School, said it's unlikely Apple or app developers could be held liable for potentially illegal content that might show up in phone apps, as long as they didn't know about the questionable content in advance. It would be impossible for Apple or developers to keep all potentially objectionable material out of the app store, since much of the content is submitted by users, he said. As the quantity of new apps and updates for apps increases, it becomes all the more difficult for the company to keep up, said Dan Moren, associate editor of Macworld, a blog about all things Apple. Joshua Topolsky, editor in chief of Engadget, a technology blog, said the impossibility of policing all app store content should free Apple from some blame. ""It's completely out of Apple's control that someone uploaded a nude photo, and to some extent, it's out of the [app] developer's hands as well,"" he said. More pressing, Topolsky said, are Apple's nebulous policies about which apps get the company's stamp of approval. Apple does not tell developers or the public exactly how the decision process works, he said. Apple did not respond to CNN's request for comment on this story. The mysterious approval process frustrates app developers and could lead some to turn away from Apple and move on to other phones, said Jared Brown, an app developer. In some cases, applications have been banned from the iPhone app store for showcasing material that also would be easily accessible through iTunes or by using Apple's mobile Web browser. A Nine Inch Nails application, for example, reportedly was pulled by Apple because it streamed a song with offensive lyrics. Band leader Trent Reznor lashed out against Apple on his Web site, calling the company hypocritical and pointing out that the song in question also was available on iTunes. In a similar incident, a Twitter app called ""Tweetie"" was pulled because it gave access to offensive words on Twitter.com. It was later put back on the app store. And an iPhone app that allowed users to shake a digital crying baby to death was yanked from the app store in April. Apple issued an apology, calling the app ""deeply offensive"" and a ""mistake."" Unlike Apple, which acts as a gatekeeper, Google lets developers post games and other programs to its Android app store without going through a screening process. Brown said he favors this idea, which lets the Android store's community flag objectionable content. Apple has said it approves 96 percent of submitted iPhone apps. In a recent update to the iPhone software, Apple included controls that let users choose which types of content they would like to block from their phones. iPhone apps now come with age-appropriateness labels, submitted by developers. Moren said this new parental-control system offers ""fine-grained controls"" and helps iPhone owners decide what content they want to buy. The company is doing anything it can to try to keep pornography and offensive material off the site for public relations reasons, he said. ""They'd much rather hang onto their image as a family-friendly company"" than let offensive material in, he said. ""I think they've really cultivated that.""","Reports say iPhone app posted nude photo of 15-year-old girl .

"(CNN) -- Apple CEO Steve Jobs is back on the job after a six-month medical leave, the company said Monday. Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO, is back at work, a company spokesman said Monday. ""Steve Jobs is back to work. He is at Apple a few days a week and working from home the other days,"" Apple spokesman Steve Dowling said. ""We're glad to have him back."" Dowling would not comment further on specifics. Jobs's return may do little to quell the tech community's obsession with his health and future role at the hip tech company. Bloggers and tech-news writers are asking many questions about Jobs' return, including: Would Apple be fine without its famous chief executive? What does Jobs' health mean for Apple stock? And why has Jobs' health been such a drooled-over story? Jobs, a 54-year-old pancreatic cancer survivor, had a liver transplant about two months ago. Apple, maker of the iPhone, iPods and Mac computers, had remained mum on Jobs' status except to repeat, over and over, that Jobs would return to work by the end of June. There have been online posts by CNBC and the UK's Telegraph saying that Apple's chief executive made a brief return to the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters last week. But the timing isn't the most important piece of this story. What Jobs means to Apple and to the tech world has more impact. Here's what some of the online community is saying: . The BBC has an interesting post on why Jobs has become such a tech rock star and why personalities are so important in the tech community: . ""A big part has to do with how he has transformed Apple and its products into some of the most talked-about in the world. And, of course, there is the whole issue of his health five years after his battle with pancreatic cancer and what it means to the future of this publicly-traded company,"" Maggie Shiels writes on the site's dot.life blog. ""Mr Jobs appears to be a complete enigma. He doesn't give interviews; he is described as a genius and a visionary; he doesn't want to talk about the past and he only wants to focus on the future."" Apple has done just fine without Jobs -- and because of him, according to Alex Pham of the Los Angeles Times. ""Although such prominent investors as Warren Buffett fretted last week about the company's future without its charismatic chief executive, longtime observers say Jobs has built an institutional mirror of himself in Apple with senior executives who share many of his values and outlook,"" Pham writes. Some say Jobs' return will have little effect on the direction Apple takes in the near term. ""He's an iconic figure that everybody wants around. He's the world's greatest salesman and that's irreplaceable,"" Gene Munster, a senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray, told CNN. ""But as far as the product direction and the product quality, the road map for the next five years is already in place [at Apple]."" PC Magazine takes a similar slant, writing Jobs likely will start a new role at Apple upon his return. He'll be less of the company's day-to-day face and more of its visionary. ""Things will be very different for him and his team,"" Tim Bajarin writes for the magazine. ""Part of the reason is that Jobs has had a near-death health issue to deal with, and he may now realize that his most important role will be to create a vision that can be carried forward for decades, not just the next product cycle."" Some bloggers have criticized Apple for not saying more about Jobs' illness. The chief executive's health affects the company's stock price, and investors should be kept more in the loop, writes Bill Taylor, a blogger at the Harvard Business Review. Taylor also says Apple's corporate culture -- which is based around Jobs' charisma -- is out of date. ""Jobs, for all of his virtues, clings to the Great Man Theory of Leadership -- a CEO-centric model of executive power that is outmoded, unsustainable, and, for most of us mere mortals, ineffective in a world of nonstop change,"" he writes. The Silicon Alley Insider further blasts Apple for its silence on Jobs' health. The blog also says it's unclear exactly when Jobs will return to work. ""Apple continues to maintain its ludicrous stance that Steve's health and future role at the company is just a private matter -- not a major question and concern for investors, customers, and employees,"" the blog says. ""In reality, it is both: A private matter AND material corporate information. And Apple needs to climb out of its reality distortion field and start treating it that way."" What do you think? Is Jobs' health and return to work a big story? Is it overblown? Should there be more empathy in media coverage of a sensitive health issue? Have your say in the comments below.","NEW: Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO, returned to work this week .

"(CNN) -- MS Dhoni continued his winning streak after guiding the Chennai Super Kings to a nail biting victory over Kolkata Knight Riders in the opening clash of the Indian Premier League. The seven week 20-over tournament offers yet more action for the cricket-loving Indian public after Dhoni led them to a World Cup triumph on home soil less than a week ago. And he masterminded an opening win in Chennai as Kolkata failed to record the four runs they need off the final delivery of the match to lose by two runs. Batting first, Chennai made 153-4 off their 20 overs. Srikkanth Anirudha got them off to a fast start as he smashed 64 off just 55 deliveries. Indian pair Suresh Raini and Dhoni then added valuable runs at the end of the innings, finishing with 33 and 29 respectively, as the Super Kings posted a challenging total. An opening stand of 64 between Manvinder Bisla and South African Jacques Kallis looked to have put Kolkata in the driving seat but when Kallis went for 54 their innings faltered. English batsman Eoin Morgan was stumped for just six runs but Manoj Tiwary got Kolkata back on track with a quick fire 27 runs, including two sixes, before he was stumped by Dhoni off the bowling of Randiv. The Knight Riders needed nine runs from the final over but lost Laxmi Shukla off the second ball. Rajat Bhatia was charged with hitting a boundary off the final ball to win but Kolkata could only manage a leg bye. After the game Dhoni told reporters: ""It was a first game with a new team, and when you get a new car you want to break it in, but you don't want to break it. Even if we did not win this game, we would have got a lot out of it."" Meanwhile, the 147-year-old Wisden Almanack -- known as the cricketers' bible -- has strengthened its social media presence by joining Facebook.

"Madrid (CNN) -- The death of Osama bin Laden ""is not the death of terrorism, unfortunately,"" U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told CNN at an international security conference Thursday. Al Qaeda has been reaching out with ""English-language publications and the like,"" prompting an increase in the number of individual potential terrorists, she said. U.S. counterterror strategy now includes both ""widening our borders"" by preventing potential terrorists abroad from boarding planes to the United States as well as dealing with ""this growth of homegrown extremism,"" she said.

John Brennan called it ""the first counterterrorism strategy that designates the homeland as a primary area of emphasis in our counterterrorism efforts."" ""We are doing everything in our power to prevent another terrorist attack on our soil ... it's not enough to simply be prepared for attacks, we have to be resilient and recover quickly should an attack occur,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- India captain MS Dhoni believes his team are peaking at the right time as they prepare to battle Sri Lanka for the Cricket World Cup. Dhoni believes the lengthy format of the competition, which started on February 19, has suited his side, who secured their place in the final with a win over Asian rivals Pakistan. With Mumbai set to host the showpiece event on Saturday, cricket-mad India is buzzing with anticipation at the tantalizing prospect of their team securing their first world title since 1983. And Dhoni, who has been praised for his leadership skills during the tournament, thinks his side are hitting top form just at the right time. ""The format has really helped us. We have had quite a few close games where we were tested,"" he was quoted as saying by the UK Press Association. ""Some of the youngsters were tested. They were at the crease at a time when a big performance was needed from them. Slowly they are getting into the groove. ""It was important that we peaked at the right time. We've chased some decent scores and we have won batting first. ""We've been tested more often than not in the games we have played so I think it will be a very good final. Sri Lanka is a very good team and we will have to do our best to beat them. ""It's not about what your rating is but how good you are on the day. You have to be at your best.""

Sachin Tendulkar is bound to be the main focus of the build up to the game as the record-breaking batsman known as 'the little master' goes in search of his 100th century. But Dhoni insists the Indian effort is a group one and that the close knit nature of his squad has contributed to their success. ""Everybody's giving more than 100 percent on the field, so we're ready for the final,"" Dhoni said. ""The team unity, the way we are backing each other and not criticizing any player has been great. If somebody is having a bad time on the field we are making sure he is wanted and everybody is helping each other. ""That's what really counts in team sport. Individuals have stepped up and said 'OK I will be the person who will perform in this particular game' but overall everybody has contributed so far in bits and pieces.""","India captain MS Dhoni says his team are peaking ahead of the Cricket World Cup final .

"(CNN) -- Two American pilots involved in a plane collision over the Brazilian Amazon that resulted in the deaths of 154 people were sentenced to community service, a Brazilian judge ruled. Judge Murilo Mendes originally sentenced Joseph Lepore and Jan Paul Paladino to four years and four days in prison, but then Monday commuted the sentence to community service to be carried out in the United States. They will also not be allowed to fly for four years and four days. The sentence stems from a September 2006 incident where, according to court records, the Legacy 600 jet the two were piloting made contact with a Gol Airlines Boeing 737. The smaller jet made an emergency landing and all were safe, but all 154 passengers and crew aboard the large commercial jet were killed. The 86-page document accuses both American pilots of being ""imprudent"" and inexperienced in piloting the two-engine plane. Brazilian officials say that the pilots turned off the Legacy's transponder, something that the pilots flatly denied during a videoconference. The case caused controversy between the United States and Brazil when local officials confiscated the pilots' passports. It was unknown whether lawyers for the two pilots would file an appeal. CNN's Helene de Moura and Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","The two pilots were involved in a fatal plane crash in 2006 .

"(CNN) -- Jurors who convicted a man of three murders in a 2007 Connecticut home invasion and recommended he be put to death for his crimes said Tuesday that serving on the case changed their lives -- and took an emotional and sometimes physical toll. ""This has strengthened my faith,"" Paula Calzetta told In Session on the truTV network. ""We all came together. It was amazing, how it worked out, and we came to the right decision. I know that this is, for me, God's plan, and I think I'm honored to be a part of that."" Jurors recommended Monday that Steven Hayes, 47, should die for his role in the 2007 invasion of a home in Cheshire, Connecticut, that left Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, dead along with her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit. They earlier convicted Hayes on a list of charges, including murder, capital murder and kidnapping. Prosecutors alleged Hayes and co-defendant Joshua Komisarjevsky invaded the home of Dr. William Petit on July 23, 2007, beat and tied up Petit, raped and strangled Hawke-Petit, molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee. The two daughters, who had been tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation. Hayes also forced Hawke-Petit to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000 from an account after finding evidence the account held between $20,000 and $30,000, authorities said. Komisarjevsky is to be tried separately later. Cindy Hawke-Renn, Hawke-Petit's sister, said Tuesday she does not believe closure can ever exist in a case like this. ""I think justice has been served, but I don't know that there truly is anything just, when something like this happens,"" she said. The brutality of the case sent shock waves through Connecticut and beyond. Calzetta and juror Maico Cardona said they were haunted by pictures they viewed -- especially pictures of the Petit daughters. ""I have a 10-year-old daughter at home,"" Cardona said. ""... Michaela was the one factor, for me, that I could not get over."" He said he was plagued by a recurring nightmare in which an 11-year-old girl was ""screaming for my help, and I'm not able to help her."" ""That is burned in my memory, those pictures of those girls,"" Calzetta said. She said during the trial, ""I thought I was doing really well. And we gave our guilty verdict, and I went home and just collapsed. I was sick for a week and a half."" She said she focused on taking care of herself during the penalty phase. ""It takes a toll on your body you don't even realize,"" she said. Both jurors said it was hard not being able to talk about the case with their families or even each other during the trial. And they said they were struck by the fact that Hayes remained stoic and showed no remorse. ""He's an empty shell ... hollow eyes and an empty shell,"" Calzetta said. But she said she was able to view Hayes more as a human being after his defense attorneys moved him closer to the jury. ""That really affected me,"" she said. ""I had never seen him that close."" Both said the jury took the case and their responsibility very seriously. But both maintained that Hayes should never again walk free. Cardona said it was important to him that Hayes receive the death penalty because ""I knew that he would be in a cell by himself, secluded ... that's what he hated."" If jurors had recommended Hayes be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, ""he would have been in general population,"" Cardona said. ""That's what he liked. That's what he was used to."" A third juror, Diane Keim, said: ""If he had life in prison, that would be going home for him."" Hayes has been in and out of the criminal justice system since he was 17 years old for a laundry-list of offenses. Cardona said he had difficulty viewing Hayes as a person and not just a perpetrator, but maintained that everyone deserves a fair trial -- and that Hayes got one. Those outside the jury room wondered why jurors took their time to decide on the death penalty, Calzetta and Cardona said -- their verdict came on the fourth day of deliberation. But ""we wanted to make sure everybody was comfortable with the decision,"" Cardona said. ""This is a huge deal,"" Calzetta said. ""Everybody needed their own time."" ""I have a very spiritual background, and I thought that this would be the only opportunity for this man to ever make peace with his Supreme Being, if he even has one,"" or to accept responsibility, Calzetta said. She felt the death penalty was necessary for Hayes to accept responsibility or experience remorse. Keim said the jurors had some trouble sorting out the paperwork and procedures, but likewise stressed the significance of their decision. ""All 12 of us tried to keep our emotions in check because we knew that we had to make a decision here on a man's life. And it was very very difficult for us,"" she said. Both Calzetta and Cardona said they did not buy the defense's claim that Hayes was merely a follower and KomisarjevskyCalzetta said. ""He's a man, and he made his choices. Unfortunately, they were the wrong ones. ... He needs to be accountable."" the ringleader of the crime, saying that Hayes had plenty of opportunities to make different choices, to stop or to leave, and did not. ""Calling him a follower is just too easy,"" Cardona said he did not believe testimony that Komisarjevsky triggered Hayes' rage by telling him, when he returned from the bank with Hawke-Petit, that the girls were dead. A police officer who interviewed Hayes just after his arrest testified that Hayes told him he saw Michaela upon his return and saw that she had changed clothes, Cardona pointed out. Asked about whether they were overcome by emotion at times, Calzetta said, ""Oh, several times. I don't think any of us expected it when it did overcome us."" Looking at the bank video of Hawke-Petit was particularly hard, she said, as jurors knew the woman was being brave and doing what she felt she had to do to save her family. ""She had no idea what she was walking into,"" Calzetta said. ""No one could have known. And all three of those girls were, I think, very brave in their final moments. They didn't deserve this."" ""It was a very emotional case and a very emotional two months,"" Cardona said. But he praised the other jurors for following the letter of the law and conducting civilized deliberations. ""There was never a shouting match,"" he said. ""There was never insults."" Both Calzetta and Cardona said they felt privileged to have served alongside the others. ""We worked extremely hard,"" Cardona said. Jurors also praised the Petit family, saying they spoke to William Petit and others after the trial. ""It was so wonderful to hug these people,"" Calzetta said, ""and they treated us like family, and we feel almost like family because we've seen such intimate things of their life and lived some things with them, and they are the most wonderful people that I think I've come across in a long time."" Cardona said he was struck by the Petit family telling jurors they were sorry the panel had to go through such an experience. ""This family is so dignified, gracious, classy,"" he said. William Petit ""held his head high throughout this entire case,"" he said. ""... He was an inspiration to all of us."" The Petit family had said they were praying for the jurors. ""It's amazing to me that in the midst of their horror and grief they are so generous to think about praying for us, there in the midst of this horror. It's heartwarming,"" Calzetta said. ""... I can't even put it to words."" Calzetta said she plans to attend Komisarjevsky's trial because she wants to support the Petit family. Jurors acknowledged that it is likely their lives will never be the same. Cardona said he thought he would be all right because he's seen movies and television, but he found it's different when something actually took place. ""You want to feel safe in your home,"" he said, but ""... there's more people like this out there.""","NEW: ""If he had life in prison, that would be going home for him,"" a juror says .

"(Mashable)  -- Twitter's role in the resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is disputed. But nobody disputes that the microblogging platform helped tell the story of the revolution as it unfolded. Now, OR Books plans to use tweets posted during the protests to create a 160-page history of the event. ""Tweets from Tahrir,"" which is set to hit bookshelves April 21, will compile tweets and photos linked to in tweets to walk readers through every day of the revolution in 140-character-or-less snippets. ""Raw emotion bursts from their messages, whether frantic alarm at attacks from pro-government thugs or delirious happiness at the fall of the dictator,"" reads a description of the book. ""To read these tweets is to embark a rollercoaster ride, from the surprise and excitement of the first demonstration, to the horror of the violence that claimed hundreds of lives, to the final ecstasy of victory."" This is quite a departure from existing tweet anthologies -- like ""Sh*t My Dad Says"" -- which tend to cover less serious topics. As The New York Times points out, the editors might run into some interesting legal questions with the new approach, in particular the question of who owns the rights for others' tweets. OR Books is in the process of contacting authors to get their permission.

"(CNN) -- Two days after the largest tornado outbreak since 2008 raked the Southeast, killing at least 45, the focus shifted Monday to cleanup. ""Everybody's been coming together,"" said Doug Western, pastor of Kendale Acres Free Will Baptist Church in Sanford, North Carolina. Along with the adjacent parsonage, the church escaped largely unscathed from the massive tornado Saturday that reduced several surrounding homes to sticks. ""That's the wonderful thing about this. We had people we didn't even know coming by wanting to help,"" said Western, whose church has served as a meal center for many neighbors and a base for delivering food and water to other neighbors by golf cart. At least 97 tornadoes struck between Thursday and Saturday, according to National Weather Service records. Yet more tornadoes will probably be confirmed on top of the 249 reports received during the three-day period, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Twisters hit 12 states: Oklahoma, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Missouri, Illinois, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland. The reports are based on preliminary weather service reports that the agency warns are often revised downward after more complete information becomes available. Of the 45 deaths reported, 22 were in North Carolina, six in Virginia, seven in Arkansas, seven in Alabama, one in Mississippi and two in Oklahoma. In North Carolina, the storms destroyed more than 130 homes and damaged more than 700, according to Gov. Bev Perdue's office. Hardest hit was rural Bertie County, where 11 of North Carolina's 22 deaths were reported. ""It ripped the houses to shreds,"" said David Lafon of the North Carolina Division of Forest Resources, who helped with rescue efforts in Bertie County. The storm destroyed 67 homes and severely damaged at least 15 in Bertie, County Manager Zee Lamb said. ""Starting today, we go into recovery mode,"" Lamb said Monday on CNN's ""American Morning."" In Ammon, North Carolina, 70 miles south of Raleigh, a tornado lifted Milton Powell's home off the ground and spun it around twice, he told CNN affiliate WWAY. ""It was just like a bad ride,"" he said. ""Everything outside came inside, and everything inside went out. I've got two dogs missing. I found one last night and have one missing that I think might be under the trailer."" In Onslow County, Marines pulled a 23-month-old boy alive from the rubble of a destroyed home after the child's mother stood up from the wreckage and said her child was buried, CNN affiliate WCTI reported. ""I started looking for stuff on the ground that was, you know, items for a baby, and I started getting to where I could see a lot of baby stuff, and I found the crib, and when I lifted the wall up, there was the baby right there,"" Sgt. Gregory Shafer was quoted as saying. At Shaw University, where President Irma McClaurin decided to call off the rest of the semester because of damage to the campus, student Julius Stukes Jr. grabbed a video camera and gave a tour of the campus ravaged by a tornado on Saturday. ""All of the offices are done. Oh, my God, this used to be an office; it's not anymore,"" he says during the video provided to CNN affiliate WNCN. ""Our campus is done. The whole campus is done."" Students at the private Baptist college, who have not yet taken final exams, will be graded on work done so far, McClaurin said in a statement. Graduation will continue as planned, McClaurin said. In Sanford, employees at the Lowe's home improvement store are being credited with saving more than 100 lives by shepherding customers into a haven toward the rear of the store as tornadic winds literally nipped at their heels. ""The winds came roaring in within about 10 seconds,"" said Gary Hendricks, who drove to the store with his wife from their nearby home, thinking they would be safe there from the impending storm. ""It roared right through the hallway we were in."" Images of the store show the roof peeled back over the front of the store, revealing rows of display shelves inside. Assistant manager Bobby Gibson said it was like ""ordered chaos"" as employees and customers scurried under cover as debris flew and metal screeched around them. ""It was just people helping people,"" Gibson said of the effort to get people to shelter. ""It was customers; it was employees; it was everybody working together."" Nearby, Terrie Rodriguez told HLN's Vinnie Politan that same twister was heading toward the Golden Corral, where she was working as manager in a restaurant full of patrons. She yelled for them to get into the kitchen, and away from the glass, . ""It took me a few seconds to register what it was in my brain. I said, 'Oh my god -- its a freaking tornado,'"" she recalled. ""It was really terrifying."" Nearby in the same town, John Douglas described how he and a friend hit the floor to shield his 9-year-old daughter when a tornado rolled through the tractor supply store he was in. ""I was just praying to the Lord, please get us out of this alive, take care of us,"" he told HLN's Politan. The deaths in North Carolina are the first from tornadoes since 2008, when two people died. In 1984, 42 people were killed in a tornado outbreak there. In Virginia, Gov. Robert McDonnell toured storm damage and met with people affected by some of the at least five tornadoes that hit the state to discuss the pace of recovery operations. ""It looks as though the resources that have been dispatched are working incredibly well,"" McDonnell said. Later Monday, the governor sent a letter to President Barack Obama, requesting a federal disaster declaration to expedite assistance to all Virginia communities -- including hard-hit Pulaski County -- affected by the storm. The 97 tornadoes confirmed so far makes the outbreak the most active since June 2008, when 136 tornadoes ripped through the Midwest, according to National Weather Service records. In February 2008, a 131-tornado outbreak struck the Southeast and Ohio Valley on Super Tuesday primary voting day, killing 57 people and causing more than $1 billion in damages, according to the National Climatic Data Center. And in April 1974, an outbreak of 148 tornadoes struck in 24 hours, killing 330 people, according to National Weather Service records. That is the most tornadoes in a 24-hour period in U.S. history, Morris said. Although it has been an active month, more severe weather appears to be on the way. A weather system building toward the Midwest is expected to present a moderate risk of tornadoes, high winds and hail in parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky on Tuesday. None of the areas heavily affected by last week's storms is threatened by those forecast for Tuesday, CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said.

"Ottawa (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William and his wife will join thousands of people Friday to mark Canada Day during their first official foreign trip as a married couple. Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, arrived in Ottawa on Thursday aboard a Royal Canadian Air Force jet . ""Catherine and I are so delighted to be here in Canada. Instilled in us by our parents and grandparents, we love this country. We have been looking forward to this moment for a very long time,"" William said. They attended a series of events, including laying a wreath at the National War Memorial to recognize Canada's servicemen and women. On Thursday evening, they met with young Canadians at a barbecue. Prince William has said it is a ""great privilege"" to be invited to Canada for their first trip as a married couple. The itinerary for the nine-day tour features a mix of official events with less formal activities, including a cooking workshop in Montreal and the Calgary Stampede, an annual rodeo and festival. On Friday, the couple will mark Canada Day by attending a citizenship ceremony and joining thousands of people for a show featuring music and military displays. Friday would have been the 50th birthday of Prince William's mother, Princess Diana, who visited Canada with Prince Charles in 1983. Widespread support for the monarchy makes Canada, which is part of the Commonwealth -- a loose association of nations that used to be part of the British Empire -- a pretty safe bet for a debut royal tour, correspondents say. However, anti-monarchy protesters are expected to demonstrate Sunday at Quebec City Hall. This is not the first trip to Canada for Prince William, who was mobbed by screaming girls when he visited in 1998. ""I have wonderful memories from my last times in Canada and as such we consider it a great privilege to have been invited to Canada for our first joint tour,"" he said. The itinerary also includes stops in Prince Edward Island -- where Prince William will take part in a coast guard rescue exercise -- the Northwest Territories and Alberta. After they wrap up their Canadian tour, the prince and duchess will head to California for three days.

"Washington (CNN) -- Aside from a moral obligation, improving the health of people in other nations is smart foreign policy, former President Clinton said Wednesday. ""We live in an interdependent world in which we have learned the hard way that no matter how brilliantly our forces perform, we can not kill, jail or occupy all of our adversaries,"" he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in discussing why the issue of global health should be important to the United States. ""We have to build a world with more partners and fewer adversaries,"" Clinton said. ""That's what foreign policy's about. ... If people think you care whether their children live or die, you don't have to send our young people off to war as often."" He and Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft and co-chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, testified on global health before the committee. Clinton established the William J. Clinton Foundation, which works on global programs including the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative. In his opening remarks, Committee Chairman John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, said that U.S. work on global health issues should be strongly bipartisan, such as President George W. Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the reauthorization of the measure in 2008. Kerry also said the Obama administration's proposed global health initiative has identified principles that should guide U.S. thinking on the matter: Looking beyond the ""vertical silo"" of any one disease; focusing on women and girls, who are at the ""center of each family's health""; and empowering other countries to eventually assume full responsibility for their citizens' care. Kerry said the administration is ""finalizing"" the initiative. ""A strong global public health system is not merely a favor we do for other countries,"" Kerry said. ""It is the right thing to do morally and strategically, and it protects our own citizens."" Gates and Clinton acknowledged budget restraints in providing care to people around the world but said the work was important. Gates said he hoped that Congress will be able to increase the funding for vaccine allocation and for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a financial organization that organizes and distributes resources to fight the diseases. ""This is very, very important work. We have evidence about the great impact that these investments have. We have a chance to increase them and make them more effective,"" Gates said.","Ex-president, Bill Gates testify before Senate Foreign Relations Committee .

"(CNN) -- Three years after 2-year-old Caylee Anthony was last seen alive, the murder trial of her mother is nearing an end. The Casey Anthony trial has lived up to the intense pre-trial hype and drama, beginning six weeks ago with her lawyer's blockbuster opening arguments alleging that her father -- George Anthony, who was Caylee's grandfather -- helped to cover-up that the girl accidentally died in the family pool. Prosecutors have denied that claim, as has George Anthony himself on the stand. Rather, they say that the Orlando woman rendered Caylee unconscious with chloroform, duct-taped her mouth and nose, and stored the child's body in her car trunk for a few days before dumping it in the woods. A utility worker found the girl's skeletal remains in December 2008, six months after the last sighting, in a wooded area near her grandparent's home. By then, her mother had already been charged with Caylee's murder. Both sides will soon get their final chances to present their disparate cases, with closing arguments expected Sunday after a rare Saturday off-day, according to court spokeswoman Karen Connolly Levey. Then, the final decision will be in the hands of the jury of seven women and five men. They will decide if Casey Anthony, now 25, is guilty on seven counts including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading police. According to Levey, the jury members -- who are all from Pinellas County, after Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. moved the jury selection process there due to extensive media coverage around Orlando -- will deliberate through the July 4 holiday, assuming a quick verdict is not reached. If Casey Anthony is convicted of murder, the prosecution has signalled that it plans seek the death penalty against her. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and denies harming her daughter. Though she didn't take the stand during the trial, her lawyers worked to question the depth and validity of the prosecution's case and raise doubts about George Anthony. They say the father, who they claimed began sexually abusing Casey at age 8, panicked upon finding the dead child and told his daughter her mother would never forgive her. The defense frequently called Casey Anthony's parents to the stand, making them a focal point. In George Anthony's case, they appeared largely intent on poking holes in the former police detective's stories. Her mother Cindy Anthony went on the stand to, among other things, alleged that she looked on the family computer for items like chloroform and, inadvertently, for neck-breaking. Forensic computer experts, called by the prosecution, worked to knock down these claims. On Friday, after all the evidence had been presented, the defense again requested that the case against Casey Anthony be dismissed -- claiming that the prosecution had failed to adequately show how Caylee Anthony died and at whose hands. And once again, Perry denied their request. Prosecution witnesses, including George Anthony, have pointed to the smells emanating from the trunk of Casey Anthony's Pontiac Sunbird that they claim came from a decaying human body -- Caylee's body, they allege. The prosecution also sought to paint Casey Anthony as someone who habitually lied, whether it was about her working at Universal Studios, that her daughter was with an imaginary nanny named Zenaida ""Zanny"" Gonzalez, or a number of other people and scenarios that she appeared to invent. Friends, her former boyfriend and acquaintances testified that in June and July 2008, Casey Anthony was staying with her boyfriend, spending time in Orlando with friends, attending parties, going shopping and hitting nightclubs. They said she did not mention her daughter being missing during that time. In opening arguments, defense attorney Jose Baez said that Casey Anthony was then doing ""what she's been doing all her life, or most of it: hiding her pain."" ""This is a tragedy that snowballed out of control,"" he said. ""This is not a murder case. This is not a manslaughter case ... this is a tragic accident that happened to some very disturbed people.""","Casey Anthony is on trial for the murder of her daughter, among other charges .

"(CNN) -- The suspected ringleader of a group arrested for allegedly luring a 15-year-old boy to a Florida home, shooting him several times, burning his body in a fire pit and putting the remains into paint cans, could face the death penalty if convicted, his attorney said Thursday. But defense attorney Charles Holloman added, ""We are not admitting any guilt at this time."" Michael Bargo, 18, appeared in court Thursday where he was denied bond in the killing of Seath Jackson, an act that allegedly involved five other people Sunday in the central Florida city of Ocala, according to a statement from the Marion County Sheriff's Office. Holloman said Jackson and Bargo had dated the same girl, though not at the same time. Jackson at one point went to Bargo's home yelling and screaming in the front yard, threatening to burn down Bargo's house, Holloman added. CNN cannot independently confirm that statement. Prosecutors say two females later lured Jackson to the home, where he was beaten with a wooden object. He was then shot several times with a .22 caliber gun, authorities said. As the wounded teen attempted to flee, he was tackled and shot again, according to the sheriff's statement. His body was allegedly placed in a sleeping bag and burned in a fire pit outside the home. His ashes were placed into several paint containers and thrown into a large garbage can, authorities said. Authorities said they learned of the alleged plot from a member of the group who admitted witnessing the killing. Four adults and two minors have been charged in connection with the death. Bargo, Charlie Kay Ely, 18; Justin Soto, 20, and two minors face first-degree murder charges, the Marion County Sheriff's Office said. James Haven, 37, faces charges of accessory to the crime for allegedly helping to dispose of Jackson's remains and driving one of the suspects out of the area to avoid arrest, authorities said. Sheriff's department documents gave little information on what led to the killing other than brief statements by suspects about a dispute and a growing hatred. Divers on Wednesday found three paint buckets in a water-filled rock quarry that are suspected of containing the victim's remains, authorities said. The contents of the buckets were delivered to a forensic specialist at the University of Florida in Gainesville to determine if the ashes and bone fragments match those of Jackson. Haven, who is not represented by an attorney, posted a $10,000 bond and was released Wednesday morning. The two minors involved in the case are currently being represented by public defenders, who could not comment. A jury trial that was expected to take place on May 2 has been postponed, said Holloman. Soto's public defender, Bill Miller, would not comment on the case. Ely is not represented by an attorney. Bargo also had a restraining order issued against him, forbidding contact with a person named Calib, who is not connected to the Jackson case, Holloman said.","NEW: Michael Bargo could face the death penalty if convicted, his attorney says .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Radioactive iodine in seawater around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant dropped sharply even before workers plugged a water leak believed to be from its crippled No. 2 reactor, the plant's owner said Wednesday night. Stopping the flow of highly radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean was a key victory for workers who have struggled to keep the earthquake-damaged plant's reactors from overheating for nearly four weeks. But the Tokyo Electric Power Co. and a top Japanese official warned the fight was far from over. Concentrations of iodine-131 had been as high as 7.5 million times legal standards in water directly behind the plant after the leak was discovered Saturday. They had dropped to less than 4 percent of that amount in the 24 hours before the leak had been cut off Wednesday morning, according to figures released by Tokyo Electric. The level remained 280,000 times higher than the legal limit, but those concentrations were dropping sharply as the water flowed out into the Pacific. Levels of longer-lived cesium-137 were down sharply as well but remained 61,000 times the legal standard, according to Tokyo Electric's water sampling data. Samples from a monitoring point 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) southeast of the plant found iodine-131 levels down to 1.5 times legal levels, with no reading for cesium. Japanese authorities said they believe the leaking water was part of the 8 metric tons (2,100 gallons) per hour being pumped in the No. 2 reactor, one of three that suffered core damage after the massive earthquake that struck northern Japan on March 11. The water has been leaking into the basement of the unit's turbine plant, carrying with it radioactive particles that are the byproduct of nuclear reactors. Until Wednesday, the fluid was pouring into the ocean from a cracked concrete shaft near the turbine plant's water intake. Workers managed to use a silica-based polymer dubbed ""liquid glass"" to seal the breach Wednesday morning, but the Japanese government's top spokesman on the crisis said government and utility officials had other problems. ""Is it completely stopped? Are there any other areas where (radioactive) water is being released?"" said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano, the spokesman. ""We cannot be optimistic, just because we were able to plug this one."" Hidehiko Nishiyama of Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said the now-contained water ""may lead to more leakage somewhere else."" Tokyo Electric began pumping nonflammable nitrogen into the primary containment vessel around reactor No. 1 early Thursday in what it said was a precautionary measure to counteract a possible buildup of hydrogen. ""The possibility of a hydrogen explosion is extremely low,"" the company announced Wednesday night. ""But more hydrogen could eventually develop in the containment vessel."" Hydrogen buildup is a symptom of overheating fuel rods and can cause explosions like the spectacular blasts that blew the roofs off the No 1 and No. 3 reactor buildings in the days after the March 11 earthquake. But Tokyo Electric said it did not believe an explosion was imminent. The radioactive cores of units 1-3 were damaged when the tsunami that followed the earthquake flooded the plant, knocking out power to its coolant systems and disabling backup generators needed to restore electricity. Engineers responded by pumping water into the reactors from outside to stave off a feared meltdown, but they are now struggling with what to do with thousands of tons of now-contaminated liquid. Since Monday night, the plant has been discharging nearly 10,000 tons of less radioactive water into the ocean, largely to make room in a waste treatment reservoir for the supercharged coolant leaking from the No. 2 reactor. ""Right now they have no systems available to them for processing liquid rad waste, and they're generating liquid rad waste at the rate of about 400,000 gallons a day,"" said Michael Friedlander, a former nuclear power plant operator. ""So without any doubt whatsoever, if they don't put in place some systems to handle this, they are going to have to continue dumping the water into the ocean."" Tokyo Electric had released about three-quarters of the water -- which also came from the subdrains below reactors 5 and 6 -- by Wednesday night and had reduced its estimate of how much was being dumped from the treatment facility. But the discharge, which Japanese officials called an emergency measure, drew protests from neighboring South Korea and enraged the country's fishermen. Edano said Wednesday that the move was ""unavoidable"" and would minimize harm to the environment. But he told reporters, ""We should have reported (more information) to the people who may be concerned, especially to the neighboring countries."" ""It was a measure to prevent more serious marine contamination, but we needed to explain the reasoning better,"" he said. Members of Japan's fishery association voiced their ire in a Wednesday morning meeting with Tokyo Electric officials, complaining that they had argued against the measure beforehand and were not told until later that the process would begin. Edano said the Japanese government is considering ""provisional compensation"" to give a more immediate boost to fishermen, ahead of a more final payment plan that may be established in the future. Experts have said the releases likely won't pose any long-term health risks to humans or sea life. It also helps that most of the radiatioactive particles detected are iodine-131, which loses half its radiation every eight days. The emergency discharge equates to about five swimming pools, compared to ""about 300 trillion swimming pools of water"" that fill the Pacific Ocean, said Timothy Jorgensen, chairman of the radiation safety committee at Georgetown University Medical Center. ""So hopefully the churning of the ocean and the currents will quickly disperse this so that it gets to very dilute concentrations relatively quickly."" After a tumultuous first few weeks, utility and government officials have described conditions recently in the plant's reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools as generally stable. Levels of airborne radiation nearby and further away, meanwhile, steadily have been declining. Still, the existence of significant amounts of collected radioactive water around the facility suggests that there may be other leaks -- and other problems.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers could open the Morganza Spillway as early as Saturday, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Friday. The Mississippi River Commission has directed the Corps to operate the crucial spillway once river flows reach a certain trigger: 1.5 million cubic feet per second. Projections indicate the tipping point could be hit as early as Saturday evening, Jindal has said. Opening the spillway would lower anticipated cresting levels along the lower Mississippi River and divert water from Baton Rouge and New Orleans but would flood much of low-lying south-central Louisiana. Seven parishes are expected to be affected by the opening, according to the Corps. The Mississippi River Commission has advised a ""slow opening,"" and the flood would spread gradually over several days, the Corps said. The Morganza Spillway has not been opened since 1973. Louisiana state and local officials braced for the possibility of major flooding in the Atchafalaya River Basin if, or when, federal authorities open the spillway north of Baton Rouge. They advised residents to expect road closings. Residents gawk at Mississippi's rise . The National Guard worked around the clock to construct a flood barrier in Morgan City, Louisiana, where the Atchafalaya River was already 3.15 feet above flood stage, according to the National Weather Service. The strategy in Morgan City, officials say, is to reinforce the levees around the city. That's where efforts were being focused Friday, rather than on handing out sandbags to individual residents. ""Really, we're just waiting,"" said Evie Bertaut, who has lived in Morgan City for 50 years. Officials believe that the levees will protect the city from flooding, but some are taking preliminary precautions, she said. At Sacred Heart Church, where Bertaut works, people spent the day moving important documents such a baptismal, marriage and financial records to the second floor. ""Most people are getting their photographs together, things that you can't replace in case you have to go,"" she said. A collective gasp as Louisiana town braces for flood . Meanwhile, in the Arkansas town of Helena, the river crested at 56.5 feet -- 12.5 feet above flood stage, according to the National Weather Service. The river's slow pace has given emergency responders more time to prepare, forecasters said. But while the slow-moving water gives residents extra time to get ready, it also means that land could remain under water for some time. Jindal urged southeastern Louisiana residents to evacuate. ""Now is the time to take action,"" he said. The U.S. Coast Guard said floodwaters could close the Mississippi River to ships at the New Orleans port as early as Monday morning. To help New Orleans, the Army Corps of Engineers said Friday that it will open 52 more bays at the Bonnet Carre Spillway just north of the city, diverting water into Lake Pontchartrain. That will mean a total of 264 bays will be open in the 350-bay spillway. Stars talk about the flooding and response . The National Weather Service said that as of Friday morning, the river was at 16.8 feet in New Orleans, just a fraction below flood stage. It is expected to crest May 23 at more than 19 feet. The New Orleans levees are built to withstand 20 feet, according to the weather service. Upriver in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Police Chief Walter Armstrong said 600 residents had been evacuated as of Thursday night. The river was expected to crest at 57.5 feet. Flood stage at Vicksburg, the level at which the river may begin flowing over its banks, is 43 feet. Armstrong said he expected higher water Friday, with more homes affected. More than two dozen roads were closed and about 45 businesses will be closed by Friday. Homes that were built between the levee and the Mississippi River were the first affected. ""We estimate that every home built on the river side of the levee from Memphis all the way to the Louisiana line is flooded,"" said Mike Womack, executive director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. Residents near Vicksburg counted on a levee for protection. In addition to the mainline levee along the river, starting near Vicksburg and extending northeast for more than 20 miles, a so-called backwater levee offers shelter. The backwater levee is designed to keep water from backing into the Yazoo River delta and is designed lower than the mainline levee so that water can flow over it. That level is expected to be reached Monday, said Charlie Tindall, attorney for the Board of Mississippi Levee Commissioners. The backwater levee was being ""armored"" by a heavy plastic coating to prevent it from washing out, he said. Nonetheless, 1.4 million acres in Mississippi, including 602,000 acres where crops are growing, could flood, said Rickey Grey of the state's Department of Agriculture. Across the South and lower Midwest, floodwaters have covered about 3 million acres of farmland, eroding for many farmers what could have been a profitable year for corn, wheat, rice and cotton, officials said. In Arkansas, the Farm Bureau estimated that damage to the state's agriculture could top more than $500 million as more than 1 million acres of cropland are under water. Womack talks about flood costs . ""It's in about 10 feet of water,"" Dyersburg, Tennessee, farmer Jimmy Moody said of his 440 acres of winter wheat, which was to be harvested in the coming month. Other farmers in Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee and Arkansas rushed to salvage what wheat they could ahead of the rising water. As for corn, farmers who were able to get into the fields during a soggy planting season in late March and April are seeing their crops in some cases under several feet of water. Some officials said Thursday that spillover effects resulting from the flood could threaten other industries. That includes the possibility that the Waterford 3 nuclear power plant in Taft, Louisiana, could be closed, according to CNN affiliate WGNO. The Mississippi River is expected to crest at 26.6 feet in Taft on May 23. If it reaches 27 feet, officials told WGNO, the plant's water intake system could shut down. NBA's Grizzlies inspired by fans in flooded Memphis . Carl Rhode of Entergy, the plant's operator, told WGNO that the threat to the intake system is not a matter of nuclear safety. However, Scott Welchel, a St. Charles Parish Emergency Operations Center official, said shutting down the plant would have a ""domino effect"" on local industries. ""It would impact every industry along the river,"" Welchel said. ""That's just something that isn't easy for people to deal with, especially on a moment's notice."" For residents in communities along the river, the damage has been far more devastating than can be measured in dollars and cents. Danny Moore of Millington, Tennessee, told CNN affiliate WPTY that the recent disaster marked the second time in one year that flooding took away nearly everything he had. Moore said that after a flood destroyed all of his furniture last year, he decided to move everything he owned into rented storage space. However, those belongings were destroyed when his storage unit was flooded several days ago. ""They say bad luck comes in threes. I hope this is the end of it,"" Moore told WPTY. The Millington resident said he lost a house to a fire in 2009. Moore said he is too preoccupied with taking care of his girlfriend, who is suffering from an infection that is damaging her liver, to look for new furniture. ""We'll do what we've got to do and keep praying,"" Moore said, holding back tears.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama doesn't often offer praise for President George W. Bush's foreign policy, but on Monday he offered the outgoing head of state accolades for battling AIDS in Africa. Zimbabwean orphan Evans Mahlangu shows the free medicine he got by walking to Mozambique in February. ""I salute President Bush for his leadership in crafting a plan for AIDS relief in Africa and backing it up with funding dedicated to saving lives and preventing the spread of the disease,"" Obama said in taped remarks to the Saddleback Civil Forum on Global Health. The videotape was played during a forum marking the 20th anniversary of World AIDS Day, established by the World Health Organization to raise awareness about the disease. Under the Bush administration, more than 2 million people infected with HIV -- most of them in Africa -- have received lifesaving anti-retroviral treatment as part of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. In July, Bush signed legislation re-authorizing the program and authorizing up to $48 billion to expand it.  Watch how one man is using soccer to raise awareness » . Obama promised to continue working ""to address the crisis around the world."" Obama's compliment was one in a series of paeans offered via videotape by world leaders to Bush, who will step down in January after two terms in the Oval Office. ""President Bush's efforts have saved literally millions of lives,"" said former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. President Paul Kagame said Rwanda was much better off because of Bush's dedication to improving global health, and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated Bush on ""his legacy of leadership."" ""The president's emergency plan for AIDS relief has made it possible for people in countries hardest hit by the disease to receive treatment,"" the U.N. chief said. Afterward, first lady Laura Bush said, ""That's sweet, so sweet."" Bush, who was awarded the first ""International Medal of Peace"" by Saddleback Church Pastor Rick Warren, said Monday the program had beaten its goal of getting anti-retroviral medicines to 2 million people infected with HIV within five years.  Watch a South African discuss living with AIDS » . ""I insisted upon measurable goals because I felt that lives needed to be saved,"" he said. ""And if you don't have measurable goals, lives might not be saved."" On Sunday, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters that nearly 240,000 babies have been born HIV-free because of U.S. support for programs to prevent HIV-positive pregnant women from infecting their children. PEPFAR was launched in 2003, when just 50,000 people in all of sub-Saharan Africa were receiving anti-retroviral treatment. Even with Bush's effort, WHO reports that only 31 percent of people in low- to middle-income countries who needed treatment received it last year, and the number of new cases is increasing 2.7 times faster than the number of new people getting treatment. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control first brought AIDS to the public's attention in 1981 when it published a report about five gay men who had become sick with a rare form of pneumonia linked to depressed immunity. Twenty-seven years later, CDC estimates that 1.1 million people in the United States are infected with HIV, and that about one in five of them is not aware of his or her status.  Watch how the stigma still lingers in the U.S. » . The WHO estimates that 33 million people worldwide live with HIV, and another 7,500 infections occur daily. In a statement posted on the organization's Web site, WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan called AIDS ""the most challenging and probably the most devastating infectious disease humanity has ever had to face."" She also emphasized the need for ""predictable, sustainable and substantial"" funding, despite the world economic crisis. ""We must ensure that the current unprecedented rollout of treatment reaches more people and is fully sustainable.

"(CNN) -- Vowing to crackdown on a new wave of  anti-government protests, President Alexander Lukashenko warned Sunday in Minsk there will be ""no color revolution"" scenarios in Belarus, the nation he has ruled with an iron fist since 1994, the official Belarusian Telegraph Company reported. The so called ""clapping protesters"", as the peaceful yet defiant anti-government movement gaining momentum throughout Belarus has become known, will not be allowed to snowball into another government-toppling insurrection inspired by the Arab Spring and  fueled by the Internet, Lukashenko said. In late 2004 and early 2005, the so-called ""Orange Revolution"" toppled the government of Ukraine, another former Soviet republic. ""We will overcome any difficulties and endure the hardships imposed on us,"" Lukashenko said. ""They want to bring us to our knees... That's not going to happen,"" he said. On Sunday, police used tear gas and batons against hundreds of protesters as they marched peacefully on Independence Day by clapping in unison as the president spoke, Russia's official Ria Novosti news agency reported. In return,  Lukashenko lashed out against the protesting crowd saying he will continue to meet any dissent with full-force, blaming outside influences for fomenting domestic unrest by handing support the Internet-fueled protesters who call themselves The Revolution Through Social Networks, the agency reported. In the past weeks, protesters have been organizing themselves via the Internet through social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, despite a government forced shutdown of these sites. According VIASNA, a Faceboook page on Human Rights in Belarus, 460 people were detained on the June 21, including several journalists, foreign nationals and even a Swedish diplomat who was later released. The Internet-organized rallies spread over the republic and took place in Brest, Grodno, Gomel, Mogilev and other cities, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported. While CNN cannot independently confirm the arrests, Russian news agencies reported that hundreds of people have been detained in the last few weeks, many sent to isolation units. Belarus, once called ""last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of Europe"" by former U.S.  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, is facing one of its worse economic crisis since it became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991. Early this year, the United States and the European Union prolonged sanctions against Belarus as a response to the political crackdown in the wake of the presidential election of December 2010. According to the U.S. Department of State, presidential opposition candidate Andrey Sannikau and five other candidates and activists and were convicted and given hard sentences as part of the post-electoral crackdown. The United Nations Human Rights Council voted in June to condemn what they deemed the ""persecution"" of opposition leaders in Belarus. The U.N.  resolution ""urges the Government of Belarus to end the politically motivated persecution and harassment of opposition leaders, representatives of civil society, human rights defenders, lawyers, independent media, students and those defending them."" Heavily dependent on Russian imports, Belarus is facing a 36% devaluation of its currency, Russia's Itar-Tass reported.","Belarus president vows to resist anti-government movement .

"(CNN) -- Chechen security agents have killed a top al Qaeda militant believed to responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in Russia's Northern Caucasus region, officials announced Friday. Chechnya's Interior Ministry said Yusef Muhammed al Emirat, a native of Saudi Arabia, died Thursday during a sting operation in the mountainous district of south Chechnya. He also operated under the name ""Mohanned."" ""Mohanned was one of the most notorious warlords,"" Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov told reporters in the Chechen capital, Grozny. ""For a long period of time, he was responsible for supplying armed groups with money, training militants and devising plans to commit terrorist acts."" Russia's National Anti-Terrorist Committee said Mohanned was""directly involved in virtually every suicide terrorist attack committed in the Russian Federation over the past few years,"" according to intelligence information gained from captured Chechen rebels. According to the Interior Ministry, Mohanned and another rebel, Chechen Ilez Sultygov, were killed on Thursday after security forces approached the men and ordered them to surrender. Police said they responded with machine-gun fire and were killed. No security officers were killed or wounded. Rebels in Chechnya started out fighting for independence in the 1990s, but in recent years, the fight has been aimed more at imposing Islamist rule and asserting their authority in the area. The fight has exacted a heavy toll in the North Caucasus region where Chechnya is located, and has now spread to other regions of Russia. The standard of living in the southwestern republic is poor compared with the rest of Russia. Unemployment is rampant and infant mortality is high. In addition, the Chechen population of about 1 million is mostly made up of Sunni Muslims, who maintain a distinctly different cultural and linguistic identity from Russian Orthodox Christians. The conflict dates back some 20 years, with Chechens having laid claim to land in the Caucasus Mountains region. Thousands have been killed and 500,000 Chechen people have been displaced from the fighting. A Chechen rebel leader took the responsibility for the deadly bombings that rocked two subway stations in central Moscow in March 2010. Russian security forces killed 17 suspected militants in the southern Russian region of Ingushetia last month, after a January 24 airport suicide bombing in Moscow this year. In addition, Chechen rebels held 700 audience-members hostage in a Moscow theater in 2002. A Russian effort to free them resulted in the deaths of 120 hostages. Chechen rebels also were accused of downing two Russian airplanes in 2004. And they took over a school in Beslan in the North Ossetia region in 2004. When the siege ended, more than 330 people had died -- half of them children. In recent years, the insurgency has moved to the east and the west -- to the republics of Dagestan and Ingushetia, where rebels are fighting troops to destabilize the region.","Two al Qaeda militants die on Thursday after Chechen security forces confront them .

"(CNN) -- New Mexico homeowners who were evacuated more than a week ago will be allowed to return home Tuesday, fire officials said. ""Homeowners will be driven to their homes in government vehicles to stay,"" said Reynaldo Rivera, public information officer for the Los Conchas fire. Thousands of families in Cochiti Mesa were forced from their homes shortly after the massive fire began June 26. On Monday, more than 2,100 firefighters were battling the wildfire that was still threatening hundreds of buildings and ancient sites on Indian lands in northern New Mexico. The Las Conchas fire has scorched more than 123,000 acres and destroyed more than 100 buildings, including 63 homes, according to InciWeb, an online interagency database that keeps track of natural disasters such as fires and floods. The fire was 27 percent contained, the website stated. ""We are not out of the woods yet,"" said Brad Pitassi, an incident management team spokesman. ""This will take a long time to contain."" The fire was threatening a number of ancient American Indian sites. It had burned thousands of acres on the Santa Clara Indian Reservation and had spread onto the Bandelier National Monument, home to ancient Pueblo homes, rock paintings and petroglyphs, fire officials said. Federal agencies also warned that heavy smoke and ash was making air quality unhealthy as far away as Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Taos, and they warned the elderly, children and those with heart or lung problems to stay indoors, according to a news release from federal agencies associated with the firefight. Since starting last week, the Las Conchas fire quickly expanded into the Santa Fe National Forest and Jemez Ranger District. It spread rapidly because of strong winds, high temperatures and dry conditions that have similarly fueled dozens of other fires around the region. Despite continued challenges, firefighters made some significant progress over the weekend. Most notably, Los Alamos County Police Chief Wayne Torpy announced that a majority of roadblocks across the county were being lifted, allowing roughly 10,000 residents to return home. Investigators determined that the fire was sparked after an aspen tree knocked down by strong winds struck a power line and caught fire, said New Mexico State Forester Tony Delfin. The tree then hit the ground and sparked nearby vegetation, he said. The fire has engulfed much of the Santa Fe National Forest, the Valles Caldera National Preserve and Bandelier National Park. It also prompted the closure of Los Alamos National Laboratory. On Saturday, the state of emergency for the lab was lifted, and the lab announced that it will reopen to employees Wednesday. At no time were nuclear or hazardous materials on site threatened, the laboratory said in a statement, adding that it was moving into an ""operational recovery mode."" About 20 archaeologists are also part of the firefighting effort, charged with identifying and helping minimize damage from spreading fires or suppression efforts. At least one is assigned to each bulldozer and road grader, one of a host of measures taken to protect archaeological sites, according to the Incident Management Team. The fire already burned over many such sites in the area, which is known for its Native American history. The Las Conchas fire is just one of dozens still burning in the United States, especially in the Southwest. Several of those are also in New Mexico, including the 100,831-acre Donaldson fire, about 10 miles south of Hondo, and the 10,250-acre Pacheco fire, about nine miles north of Santa Fe. Pitassi said that a combination of ""extremely dry fuels,"" rugged terrain, strong winds and high temperatures have led to a ""record-breaking year"" for wildfires in the United States -- and one that still has no clear end in sight. ""We've had almost a perfect-storm scenario,"" he said. CNN's Antoinette Campbell contributed to this report .","Thousands of residents can return home Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities began closing portions of central Louisiana's Morganza Spillway as the swollen Mississippi River receded Wednesday, reducing the need to divert water down another waterway. The Army Corps of Engineers announced Wednesday that it already had closed three of the 17 open bays at the Morganza Spillway, which was opened May 14 to prevent the Mississippi from flooding New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The Corps said much as 1.2 million gallons (172,000 cubic feet) per second had been pouring through the spillway, which diverted water through the Atchafalaya River basin to the Gulf of Mexico west of New Orleans. The resulting high water has caused some flooding down the Atchafalaya. But the water levels ""continue to be lower than anticipated"" throughout the basin, Corps spokesman Ken Holder said in a statement announcing the decision. The river remained about four feet above flood stage Wednesday night at Bayou Sorrel and about 7 feet over flood stage at Morgan City, on the approaches to the Gulf. But it was more than five feet lower at the town of Krotz Springs and about two feet below flood stage at Butte LaRose, about 20 miles south of the spillway. Rising water levels forced Louisiana authorities to halt boat traffic down a four-mile stretch of the Atchafalaya around the town of Butte LaRose starting Thursday, since the surface of the river had climbed to within seven feet of high-voltage power lines, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries announced. The 125-bay Morganza Spillway was last opened during a 1973 flood.","The spillway was opened May 14 to head off flooding in southern Louisiana .

"(CNN) -- The Syrian government on Thursday warned its citizens not to participate in unlicensed protests, saying that ""the laws in force in Syria will be implemented for serving the security of the citizens and the stability of the homeland."" The announcement came late in a day during which Syrian tanks and security forces swooped down hard on the restive city of Daraa, witnesses said. Helicopters hovered as security forces fanned out across the besieged city, breaking into homes and making arrests.  Streets were littered with dead bodies and dwellings had no water or electricity. A city near the Jordanian border, Daraa is where the anti-government protests began and took hold last month. Now it is a test for police and soldiers attempting to quell protests and a government trying to cope with angry unrest. Also Thursday, the Muslim Brotherhood entered the fray by offering support for the protesters. ""Hereby, we announce that we will be part of this national project led by the spectacular vision and the great spirit of the Syrian youth and we call upon all Syrians of all backgrounds to join in establishing a national project in which all Syrians achieve what they have dreamt of -- liberty, freedom and progress,"" the Islamic political group said in a statement. Human Rights Watch said army troops and other security forces have killed more than 300 protesters since March 16. Other sources have cited higher numbers, and the government reports security personnel have also been killed. Many of the deaths have occurred in and around Daraa, where heavy firing could be heard Thursday and smoke was seen rising from homes, mosques and schools. Hundreds of snipers were stationed on the roofs of several buildings and security forces were shelling the city with mortars and anti-aircraft weapons, a witness said. One witness said dozens of tanks rumbled across a bridge and fired shells, as people hurled rocks at the tanks and tried to stop them from moving into the old part of the city. Another witness said security forces making mass arrests detained a large number of young men. A resident said people were too scared to take the wounded to hospitals since the streets were filled with security forces. Residents have gone without electricity, milk and medicine for four days, said the witness, who asked not to be named for security reasons. CNN was not able to independently confirm the accounts. The unrest began in Daraa in March after teens were arrested for scribbling anti-government graffiti. People protested the arrests, security forces greeted the demonstrators harshly, and that emboldened more rallies. Protests spread to other parts of Syria, where the same dynamic played out, despite promises and gestures of reform by the regime of Bashar al-Assad. There's been an outcry in many international quarters due to the use of force against the peaceful gatherings. Human Rights Watch Wednesday urged Arab countries to ""join international efforts to establish an independent international inquiry"" into the issue. ""In recent days President Bashar al-Assad's government cut off access and communications with several cities, sending in tanks and troops in an effort to crush widespread public dissent,"" the group said. The U.N. Security Council debated Syria on Wednesday but failed to agree on a response to the crisis. The situation has even made its way into the planning for Friday's royal wedding in Britain of Prince William and Kate Middleton. The entire Syrian diplomatic corps was invited to the event as a matter of protocol, but the British Foreign Office said Thursday that Syria's ambassador to the United Kingdom is now not welcome ""in the light of this week's attacks against civilians by the Syrian security forces, which we have condemned.""

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- Argentinians planning to travel to the northern part of the country, Brazil and Paraguay were lining up for vaccinations Tuesday, because of a yellow fever breakout that has killed at least 21 people in the region. An Argentinian man receives a vaccination in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Public health officials recommend that anyone planning to travel to an affected area get the vaccine -- which is effective for a decade -- 10 days before arriving. Concern in Argentina began last month, when health authorities reported finding 17 dead monkeys in Pinalito Park, in the San Pedro Department of Misiones Province. Tests showed they had died of yellow fever. But the Ministry of Health's Dr. Hugo Fernandez pointed out that the last documented case of yellow fever among people in Argentina was in 1841. ""What we have had until now is death in monkeys from the transmission of the virus,"" he said. ""That put us on alert, and we have put in place all the necessary controls since January of this year.""  Watch residents line up for the vaccines » . The Ministry of Health recommended that residents and travelers to the ""high-alert"" area in northern Argentina, near the borders of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, also receive the vaccine. On Monday, Paraguay's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare confirmed 16 cases, eight of them fatal, in two areas in the center of the country -- San Pedro Department and Central Department. Brazil had tallied 13 deaths, the country's Ministry of Health said. As of Saturday, more than half of the 2 million vaccine doses obtained by Paraguay from the World Health Organization had been administered, the government said. A team from the WHO's Pan American Health Organization has been working in the country since February 15. Some Paraguayans have endured long waits for vaccines in sweltering heat. ""Citizens pay taxes for our health and education, but there are no vaccines here,"" Cynthia Shaerer, told CNN last week. ""We don't need speeches here. We need vaccines."" People contract yellow fever from the bite of an infected mosquito. The disease causes fever, muscle pain, headaches, shivering, nausea and vomiting, the World Health Organization says. Most people improve after three or four days, but some enter a second ""toxic"" phase that causes fever, jaundice and blood in the vomit, the health organization says. About half of the people who enter the second phase of yellow fever die within 10 days. There is no treatment, so medical authorities recommend vaccinations. Yellow fever typically is found in tropical regions of Africa and Latin America. E-mail to a friend .

Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Selcuk Unal said the government is trying to determine more about the people and how and why they chose to leave Syria. ""They just came to the border post and want to go in without passports. They were let in,"" Unal said. ""We are trying to figure out whether this is an individual event or the tip of the iceberg."" Yaylidagi Mayor Mustafa Kemal Dagistanli and another local government official, who asked not to be named, said the people are Syrian citizens and Muslims. The local official said most of the people are ethnic Turkmens, and three of them speak Turkish. Most of them are from Qamishli, in the northeastern region, and Latakia, on the western coast. The official said the people say they've been persecuted by the government of President Bashar al-Assad -- now locked in confrontation across the country with anti-government protesters.

"(CNN) -- Dozens more workers Monday joined the effort to clean up an oil spill that dumped hundreds of barrels of crude into Montana's Yellowstone River over the weekend, ExxonMobil said. ExxonMobil said between 750 to 1,000 barrels (32,000 to 42,000 gallons) of oil escaped late Friday when a pipeline ruptured beneath the river near Billings. Some of the oil has washed ashore or formed pools of ""milky brown"" residue in river eddies, Yellowstone County Sheriff Mike Linder said. High water and a swift current has helped break up the spill, local officials said. But cleanup efforts have been hampered by flooding that has made it harder to track and clean up the oil, said Linder and Duane Winslow, the county's emergency services director. The Yellowstone was running above flood stage over the weekend, sweeping brush and logs into the river, and had a 5- to 7-mph current Sunday. ""It's too dangerous to do anything on the river, to put out any sort of boats or anything,"" Winslow said. ""So people will be working from the shores rather than out in the middle of the river."" About 80 people were expected Monday to join the 120 working to contain the oil spill, ExxonMobil said in a statement posted late Sunday on its website. Cleanup crews are using absorbent pads to soak up oil, boom to isolate oil that has pooled adjacent to the river and vacuum trucks and tankers to pick up and dispose of the oil, it said. The spill was discovered late Friday night near Laurel, west of Billings and about 100 miles downstream from Yellowstone National Park. The pipeline feeds an ExxonMobil refinery in Billings, and the company said it had shut down the line within minutes. ""We will stay with the cleanup until it is complete, and we sincerely apologize to the people of Montana for any inconvenience the incident is creating,"" Gary Pruessing, the president of ExxonMobil's pipeline subsidiary, said in a statement issued Sunday. There were no reports of wildlife being endangered by the spill, Tim Thennis, who is leading the response for the Montana's Disaster Emergency Services agency, said Sunday. Rescue worker with the International Bird Rescue also were expected to join cleanup efforts Monday, ExxonMobil said. The Montana Audubon Conservation Education Center and Yellowstone Valley Audubon have offered to provide wildlife recovery services and facilities, it said. The spill forced the evacuation of more than 200 nearby residents after it was discovered Friday night, but they were allowed to return Saturday morning. Laurel rancher Lloyd Webber said the spill left a ""pretty heavy"" smell of oil hanging over the area Friday night as he and his wife left their home. ""We went to the Perkins in Billings and drank coffee for two or three hours, then went back,"" said Webber, who lives about a half-mile from the river. ExxonMobil said it had received more than 70 calls to its community claims line. ExxonMobil did not say whether these calls were individual claims or what the claims were being made. The Yellowstone is one of the tributaries of the Missouri River, which it joins in neighboring North Dakota. Thennis said state agencies, the federal Environmental Protection Agency and ExxonMobil are working together to clean up the spill. CNN's Matt Smith, Joe Sutton and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","High water and a swift current has helped break up an oil spill .

"(CNN) -- A man who was taking part in a human cannonball show in Detling, England, was fatally injured Monday when the event failed to go off as planned, Kent police said. The incident occurred in the afternoon during Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show at the Kent County Showground, southeast of London, police said. The British Press Association, citing police, said a safety net failed to engage. A Kent Police spokesman declined to identify the man beyond saying he was in his 20s. Relatives of the man had been informed of the mishap, but his body had not been formally identified, a police spokesman said. A statement on the Scott May website said all shows had been canceled ""until further notice."" The stunt show, which has been touring since 1991, features monster trucks, two-wheel driving, fire stunts and car crashes. David Smith Jr., who holds the Guinness Book of World Records entry for distance shot from a cannon (59.05 meters), said he had not before heard the terminology about a safety net's failure to engage, but said careful planning can make the shots less dangerous. Smith, 33, whose father taught the stunt to his seven children, has been ejected from the barrel of a cannon some 5,000 times. It can be nerve-wracking, the record-holder said, but should not prove disastrous. ""We've never had a cannon not fire or miss a net, and I mean we're talking tens of thousands of cannon shots combined between us all,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. After 14 years of taking his act across around the world, ""I feel that my cannon shots are probably safer than me driving to the next show -- because I control my environment and I control my equipment."" Still, he acknowledged, ""We've had some broken bones and stuff."" He expressed condolences to the family of the man who died.","The incident occurred during Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari's Fernando Alonso set a blistering pace on the first practice day ahead of this weekend's Formula One Monaco Grand Prix. The Spaniard edged out McLaren's British driver Lewis Hamilton in the afternoon session after drivers' championship leader Sebastian Vettel had gone fastest for Red Bull in the morning. Alonso's quickest lap of one minute 15.123 seconds was 0.105 secs ahead of Hamilton, while Nico Rosberg was third in his Mercedes. McLaren's Jenson Button was fourth with Vettel fifth, Felipe Massa sixth and Michael Schumacher seventh. ""I'm confident with the car,"" Alonso told reporters. ""I'm happy to push and I'm pushing more and more every lap with no big surprises from the car.

At the moment the car is offering me that possibility so I'm happy."" Alonso is currently fifth in the standings, 67 points behind Vettel but is showing signs of improvement after a difficult start to the season. The Spaniard showed glimpses of form at last Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, which he led for 18 laps before finishing fifth, but was wary that his rivals would raise their game going into qualifying on Saturday. ""It's only Thursday and we know that on Saturday the pressure will increase,"" he said. ""Red Bull always test different things on Fridays and then on Saturday they are very strong so I expect them to be competitive in qualifying. This is a very unique venue so anything can happen here."" Hamilton, whose victory in China is his sole success this season, trails Vettel by 41 points, but demonstrated in the afternoon session he could be a big threat to the podium this weekend. Hamilton told reporters he is a big fan of Monaco: ""It is fantastic, I love this track. I've just been so excited all day. I kept it out of trouble and I'm happy with the balance of the car and our high-fuel run. ""It is going to be close, though, as the Red Bull is fast and the Ferrari looks fast too.

"LONDON, England -- Malaria is preventable and curable, yet every 30 seconds, a child in sub-Saharan Africa dies from the disease, according to the World Health Organization. The Roll Back Malaria partnership has pledged money for nets, anti-malarial treatments and research for a vaccine. Last year on April 25, the World Malaria Day initiative was launched to raise awareness of the disease and efforts to control malaria around the world, as part of the Roll Back Malaria partnership -- a global group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and governments. The groups behind Roll Back Malaria set ambitious goals to ensure universal access to malaria medication and treated mosquito nets in Africa by the end of 2010. They also announced plans to attain near zero malaria-related deaths by 2015. According to the WHO, the malaria currently kills one million people every year. As the second World Malaria Day approaches, how successful has the Roll Back Malaria partnership been in its aims? Certainly, in the past two years, rapid progress has been made in malaria control, including a 60 percent decrease in malaria-related deaths in some countries such as Ethiopia and Zambia, according to figures from the WHO. Richard Feachem is director of the Global Health Group, an organization launched to design malaria control programs in developing countries. Writing in the medical journal Lancet, he said: ""Overall, we have many reasons to be optimistic. ""Except for those countries that are politically dysfunctional or suffering major conflicts, the 61 malaria control countries in the heartland will make great progress in reducing death and sickness from malaria over the next 10 years."" ""The challenge now is the implementation gap between political commitment, ambition, and availability of funds, and the capacity at ground level to do the work that needs to be done."" The Roll Back Malaria partnership's profile has also been raised by the surge of new NGOs such as Malaria No More, and their partnerships with international celebrities. Footballer David Beckham and actor Ashton Kutcher recently lent their support to the cause. Earlier this month, Kutcher won a Twitter race against CNN to reach one million followers. The actor pledged 10,000 mosquito nets to Malaria No More, if he beat CNN, and 1,000 if he lost. CNN agreed to do the same. CNN's founder Ted Turner's United Nations Foundation has also donated $2 million to deliver insecticide-treated bed nets to more than 630,000 people in African refugee camps. ""Since last year, we have achieved enormous progress in many countries by donating money, assistance and monitoring progress,"" executive director of Roll Back Malaria, professor Awa-Marie Coll-Seck, told CNN. Read our malaria A to Z guide . And last week, the partnership decided on a new plan to subsidize anti-malarial medication in 11 African countries at first, where one treatment dose now costs $10 in the private sector, more than many Africans earn in a week. ""We will negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to make them reduce the price of anti-malarial medication"" said Coll-Seck, a former Senegalese Health Minister. As a result, the price of medication will be expected to drop to at least a tenth of its current price. To achieve all its goals, Coll-Seck says the partnership needs $5 billion. They have already received $2 billion from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the United States Presidential Malaria Initiative -- launched by President Bush in 2005 -- and foundations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. ""I think that achieving zero deaths by 2015 is a very ambitious goal,"" Awa explained, ""but I believe at least several countries will be able to achieve it. On a global scale, we still need progress."" Janet Hemingway, CEO of the Innovative Vector Control Consortium at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, believes the Roll Back Malaria partnership was right to strive for such ambitious targets. ""We have to strive for these goals"" she told CNN, ""because unless they set these goals, we're never going to achieve them. ""Now it's up to us on the ground to make them happen.""","As World Malaria Day approaches, many are optimistic about ending malaria deaths .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A robbery suspect nicknamed the ""Grandma Bandit"" died in a shootout Friday in Atlanta, Georgia, authorities said. Later, authorities discovered that Grandma was actually Grandpa. ""After further investigation, detectives have determined the person believed to be a female suspect in fact is a male,"" DeKalb County police spokeswoman Mekka Parish said Friday evening. ""His name is Roxanne Taylor, a 57-year-old man."" Police had issued an arrest warrant on Thursday for someone they thought was a 58-year-old woman, Roxanne Taylor, charging her with three robberies. The ""Grandma Bandit"" gained notoriety because of the apparent woman's age and signature robbing style -- approaching cashiers at Atlanta-area CVS and Rite-Aid pharmacies and demanding cash after producing a revolver from her purse. She was a distinctive-looking woman with swollen cheeks who wore oversize, dark sunglasses and a baseball cap, according to surveillance video and witness accounts. On Friday morning, Taylor was spotted at a Wendy's fast-food restaurant. Witnesses identified him as the ""Grandma Bandit"" because he was profiled on a Crime Stoppers piece earlier in the week, Parish said. ""The individuals called 9-1-1 and nearby Atlanta police officers arrived to investigate, leading to a pursuit,"" she said. Taylor led police on a car chase that ended with a multi-car accident off an interstate exit. ""When officers pursued to investigate the accident, they heard a shot ring out,"" Parish said. ""The responding officers returned fire."" It was not immediately known whether Taylor's fatal gunshot wounds were self-inflicted or caused by police, Parish said. The arrest warrant for Taylor said he had netted about $400 from the three holdups.","NEW: Authorities discover she was a he .

"(CNN) -- At their president's urging, Sri Lankans took to the streets Sunday to rail against a critical United Nations report that found credible allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by both sides during the final stages of the country's civil war. Hundreds turned out for the peaceful demonstration in Colombo, answering a call from President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The protesters, who joined up with a larger May Day rally demonstrating for worker's rights, targeted the United Nations, some of them holding up signs tweaking the world body's Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. It was in response to a U.N. report released Monday, in which a three-member panel recommended that Sri Lanka immediately conduct an investigation into the alleged violations of international law and take other measures to ""advance accountability."" Human rights groups have already alleged that both government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels violated humanitarian laws and that thousands of civilians were killed during the war, which ended in May 2009 after the government declared victory. The rebels had fought a 26-year bloody separatist war that left thousands dead and large numbers of others internally displaced, according to the United Nations. The report concluded there were ""credible allegations, which if proven, indicate that a wide range of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international humanitarian rights law was committed both by the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE (rebels), some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity."" In the war's final stage, which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009, the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of northern Sri Lanka known as the Vanni, where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting. The report said the government used ""large-scale and widespread shelling"" that left large numbers of civilians dead. Some of the shelling happened in no-fire zones where the government had encouraged civilians to congregate, the report said. Government forces also shelled a U.N. hub, food distribution lines and fired near ships belonging to the International Committee of the Red Cross that were picking up the wounded and their relatives from beaches, the report said. The government shelled hospitals on the front lines as well, some of them repeatedly, the report said. ""Most civilian casualties in the final phases of the war were caused by government shelling,"" the report said. The U.N. secretary-general's spokesman said Ban ""sincerely hopes that this advisory report will make a contribution to full accountability and justice so that the Sri Lankan government and people will be able to proceed towards national reconciliation and peace.""

"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- In the coming weeks, Congress will attempt to forge a health care bill from proposals developed by five House and Senate committees. The final bill will likely include a mandate that most Americans buy health insurance, subsidies for the purchase of insurance and bans on denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The bill may also include a ""public option,"" government insurance that would compete with private insurance. The underlying presumption behind this legislation is that government health insurance should be expanded to cover the uninsured. This presumption is wrong. Government should not subsidize health insurance -- for the uninsured, the poor, the elderly or anyone else -- or regulate health insurance markets. Here's why. Subsidizing health insurance means that patients and doctors are insulated from the costs of health care, so they utilize too much -- often in the form of unnecessary tests or medical procedures whose value hasn't been proven. This excess demand, along with technological progress, means rapidly growing deficits, so governments limit reimbursements to health providers or ration care. This kills innovation and creates its own inequities. The taxes necessary to fund subsidies are a drag on economic growth. The reason the Obama administration and congressional Democrats are seeking to cover the uninsured is that health insurance is expensive. Without government support, many people could not afford health insurance. The conventional wisdom is that government should therefore subsidize health insurance for those who cannot afford it. This confuses two issues: whether government should help the poor, and how government should help the poor. If society wants everyone to have health insurance, the obvious approach is to give the poor enough money so that individuals can purchase on their own. Just because people want government to help the poor doesn't require it to pay for specific kinds of goods. If some people do not purchase insurance and then become ill, they would have to rely on private charity. Now one possible objection to designing anti-poverty programs in this way -- cash transfers, but no subsidies for health insurance -- is that it would require a lot of cash. That is not a convincing objection. Health insurance is just as expensive if provided as a separate benefit. The cash approach makes clear just how much money is involved, but it does not increase the amount. The other possible objection to the cash transfer approach holds that, if left unregulated, private health insurers would deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Thus, some people might get no health insurance at all. This outcome is unlikely, however, assuming health insurance is unregulated. In that case, insurers would set higher premiums for the unhealthy, but they would cover anyone willing to pay a sufficiently high price. Thus, the question is whether society should compensate those who face higher prices because of their health status? The answer is no. Advocates for such compensation would suggest that it is basic fairness for society to insure people against the bad luck of being born with lousy genes. Many differences in health status, however, arise from behavior: heart disease from overeating, lung cancer from smoking, and cirrhosis from drinking, to name a few. If society compensates everyone for differences in their health status, it is often rewarding unhealthy behavior, perhaps even encouraging it. In addition, it is logical for society to treat the differences in financial well-being due to health in the same way it treats differences due to IQ, athletic ability, race, country of origin, family background, and so on. These and other factors mean that some people, through no fault of their own, face hard financial circumstances, whether because of their ability to earn income or because of the higher prices they face for certain goods, such as health insurance. Yet if society tried to equalize all differences resulting from, say, IQ, it would kill the incentive to work hard and destroy the economy's productive capacity. Thus, most people believe society should reduce these differences -- by helping the poor -- but most also recognize that society should not attempt to eliminate all differences. This same tradeoff -- between helping the least fortunate and promoting an efficient economy -- applies in the case of health insurance. A reasonable balance is for government to provide a social safety net that protects the poor and allows them to purchase some health insurance on their own. An alternative is to provide health insurance vouchers, but only to the poorest segment of society. Guaranteeing health insurance for everyone is too costly, and it means worse health care for everyone. That is why Obamacare, and existing subsidies for health insurance, are treatments that are worse than the disease. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Miron.","Miron: Government should not subsidize health insurance .

"Islamabad (CNN) -- A bombing Monday at a restaurant in a Pakistani tribal region near the Afghan border wounded 11 people, including four children, authorities said. The blast occurred in the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan, said Muhammed Khan, a government official. The blast comes as the United States has put increasing pressure on Islamabad to root out terror groups believed to be running training camps in North Waziristan, a mountainous region of northern Pakistan. U.S. officials have long believed terror groups, such as the Haqqani network, are running training camps in the district. The Haqqani is an insurgent group based in North Waziristan that is allied with the Taliban. Last week, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with Pakistan's president to repair the relationship between the two countries following a U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Clinton said Pakistan has a responsibility to prevent insurgents from waging war in Afghanistan from its territory.","A bomb blast wounds at least 11 people in Pakistan's volatile tribal, an official says .

"(CNN) -- The body found in a creek near Indianapolis is not missing Indiana University student Lauren Spierer, a medical official said Tuesday. Forensic tests found no link to Spierer and have determined the body belongs to an African-American female, said Alfarena Ballew, chief deputy coroner for Marion County. Officials believe the decomposed body had been in the creek for about two and a half weeks before it was discovered on Sunday. Bloomington police have been searching for Spierer, a 20-year-old sophomore, since June 2, when she was last seen leaving a sports bar after a night out with friends. In mid-June, police found possible new clues to Spierer's disappearance -- images of a white pickup caught on a security surveillance video. But they ruled out a connection. Officials have received thousands of tips, but none so far have yielded anything concrete. In late June, hundreds of volunteers searched a 10-mile area in Indiana in an event called ""Find Lauren Day."" Spierer's mother was at the event and thanked the volunteers even though they were not successful. Charlene Spierer described her daughter as a sweet, bubbly girl. ""Perhaps it was a terrible accident that happened and we can deal with that,"" Charlene Spierer said in late June. ""What we can't deal with is what we don't know. So information is the most valuable thing we need right now."" Officials still don't know how the body ended up in Fall Creek. Ballew said her office will use DNA evidence and dental records to help identify the woman and make a determination about how she died. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","Forensic tests confirm body found in creek is not Lauren Spierer .

"(CNN) -- Don't be surprised if Casey Anthony walks out of jail a free woman after her sentencing Thursday, legal experts say. And, they add, there is nothing stopping her from cashing in on book or movie deals -- as her acquittal on serious charges now means she is free to profit off her story. With Tuesday's not guilty verdict on murder charges behind  her,  Anthony -- and the thousands riveted by every twist in the case --  now turn their attention to Thursday when the 25-year-old will learn her fate. A jury on Tuesday found Anthony not guilty of first degree murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter  in the 2008 death of her daughter  Caylee. But she still faces sentencing on four counts of lying to police regarding a missing person case. Each  misdemeanor count carries a maximum  sentence of one year in county  jail,  for which Judge Belvin Perry has  the option of sentencing her  consecutively or  concurrently. Many legal  experts believe Anthony will be freed on time-served because she has already been jailed for about three years. ""I would be surprised if she doesn't walk out of the courtroom Thursday,"" said Atlanta defense lawyer Penny Douglas Furr. ""She has served so much time already. I don't think the judge will make her serve any more time. The real question now is, what will she do next."" There will be no legal restrictions on Anthony profiting on the details of this case, cashing in on deals for movies, books or interviews, analysts say. Because of her acquittal, so-called Son of Sam laws --  laws designed to keep criminals from earning money from their crimes -- do not apply, they say. ""Why can't she make money off of her story?"" said Drew Findling, another defense lawyer. ""You've seen so many cases where witnesses for the prosecution have profited from the case. Look at the O.J. Simpson case and how the prosecutor, who lost the case, wrote books and made money afterwards. So why can't Casey do it?"" HLN's Nancy Grace, who has covered the Anthony case extensively since Caylee was reported missing, did not mince words about Anthony's possible plans. ""Now tot mom finally has the beautiful life that she envisioned. She's free,"" Grace said on her show Tuesday. ""She will walk free as early as this Thursday. She's set up to make very likely over a million dollars off the murder of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee Anthony."" The seven-week long trial ended with 11 hours of deliberation when an Orange County, Florida, jury found Anthony not guilty of the most serious charges. ""This jury ignored the scientific evidence,"" said New York lawyer Susan Moss. ""Apparently, they found the only 12 people who still think the world is flat."" But Andrea Lyon, who once represented Anthony, said the evidence wasn't there. ""That prosecution overreached,"" Lyon said ""AC 360."" ""They used junk science. They attempted to overwhelm the lack of evidence with character assassination. They did not have evidence of a homicide."" The jurors in the case declined to speak to the media as did four alternate jurors. The fifth, Russell Huekler, told CNN he agreed with the verdict ""wholeheartedly."" ""The prosecution did not prove their case,"" Huekler said. ""The big question that was not answered: How did Caylee die?"" Through the course of the trial, dozens lined outside the Orlando courtoom to get a glance at the spectacle.  The proceedings featured  allegations of sexual abuse, questions regarding Anthony's  competence and various theories on what happened to Caylee. Prosecutors alleged Anthony used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious and then duct-taped her mouth and nose to suffocate her. They alleged that she put the child's body in the trunk of her car for a few days before disposing of it. Anthony's defense attorneys maintained that Caylee was not murdered at all. They said the child drowned in the Anthony's above-ground pool on July 16, and that Anthony and her father, George, panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. Anthony's lawyer, Jose Baez, also alleged that Anthony's father sexually abused her from the age of 8 and she had been taught to conceal her pain. The upbringing explained some Anthony's bizarre behavior during the time her daughter was missing, he argued. According to testimony,  Anthony was not looking frantically for her missing child as she later told police. Instead, she moved out of her parents' home and stayed with her then-boyfriend, Tony Lazzaro. She also got a tattoo saying ""Bella Vita"" -- Italian for ""beautiful life"" -- and went shopping, witnesses said. She also partied at Orlando nightclubs and participated in a ""hot body"" contest at one point, according to testimony. George Anthony denied the molestation claim in testimony, saying, ""I would never do anything like that to my daughter."" Throughout the trial, the pain experienced by Anthony's family was evident. Both her father and mother sobbed on the stand at times recalling their granddaughter. George Anthony also cried as he testified about his January 2009 suicide attempt, which came shortly after Caylee's remains were identified. At one point during the trial, Anthony's mother, Cindy, was seen mouthing the words ""I love you"" to her. After the verdict, the parents released a statement saying they  wished to ""move forward privately"" and requested the media respect their  privacy. ""While the family may never know what has happened to  Caylee Marie Anthony,  they now have closure for this chapter of their  life. They will now begin the  long process of rebuilding their lives,"" the parents said. If Anthony is released Thursday, it is unclear if she will be rebuilding her relationship with her parents. In Session correspondent Jean Casarez said she asked Cheney Mason of Anthony's defense team where Anthony will go when she is free. ""He told me it would not, with all seriousness, be back to her family home,"" Cesarez recounted. ""But, of course, anything is possible.""

"(CNN Student News) -- May 23, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Baghdad, Iraq  • Israel  • Iceland . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Your school probably has fire drills, tornado drills. But how should you prepare for zombies?! Believe it or not, the government has an answer. I'm Carl Azuz. This is CNN Student News! First Up: Violence in Baghdad . AZUZ: First up today, deadly violence in Baghdad, as a string of bombings hits the Iraqi capital. Fifteen explosions went off within hours of each other on Sunday. Iraqi authorities said the mix of car bombs and roadside bombs killed at least 18 people and wounded at least 80 others. There's been an increase recently of violence in Iraq. That includes yesterday's attacks. It's raising some concerns about whether or not Iraqi security forces will be able to protect their own country. Britain pulled the last of its combat troops out of Iraq yesterday, and U.S. troops are scheduled to leave Iraq by the start of next year, though Iraqi leaders might ask them to stay longer. Just the Facts . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Just the Facts! There is a history of conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people. The areas at the center of that conflict are Gaza and the West Bank. Israel took control of these areas in 1967 during the six-day Arab-Israeli War. Right now, around 4 million Palestinians live in Gaza and the West Bank. Leadership Differences . AZUZ: For decades, there have been attempts to make peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. President Obama tried to push for a new start to peace talks in a speech he gave last week. During that speech, he mentioned going back to the pre-1967 war borders, but with exchanges in land that both sides would agree on. The idea did not go over well with Israel's prime minister. Yesterday, President Obama explained what he meant when he gave a speech to AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. He told the conference that the pre-1967 borders should be a starting point for negotiations, and that he expects Israel and the Palestinians to work together to define new borders. Part of the reason the U.S. is so involved in what's going on in Israel is that the two countries are very close allies. The U.S. has supported Israel since it was founded in 1948. But as Brianna Keilar explains, that friendship was pretty tense late last week. (BEGIN VIDEO) BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was about to leave for the U.S. when President Obama made the announcement that infuriated him. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We believe the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines wiith mutually agreed swaps. KEILAR: At the White House Friday, Netanyahu panned the proposal. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: These lines are indefensible because they don't take into account certain changes that have taken place on the ground, demographic changes that have taken place over the last 44 years. KEILER: After the initial war of words, the White House hoped the meeting would be a time to kiss and make up. OBAMA: Obviously, there are some differences between us, the precise formulations and language. And that's going to happen between friends. NETANYAHU: We have an enduring bond of friendship between our two countries. KEILER: But for all of the niceties, Netanyahu drew a line in the sand, and not only on a return to pre-1967 borders. He said Israel will not negotiate with a Palestinian government supported by Hamas or house Palestinian refugees. NETANYAHU: That's not going to happen. Everybody knows it's not going to happen, and I think it's time to tell the Palestinians forthrightly that it's not going to happen. KEILER: Despite tough words, the U.S. and Israel will remain allies, even past this rough spot. But the tension between the two leaders was palpable. After the President's meeting with Netanyahu, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was peppered with questions about the disagreement on the borders issue. He said the president made clear the pre-1967 border proposal is a starting point, that the mutual swaps that would create the eventual borders would be negotiated. The thing is, what the White House considers a starting point, Israel still considers a non-starter, even after the meeting. Brianna Keiler, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEO) Trip to Europe . AZUZ: President Obama is working on some other alliances this week. He's heading to Europe to visit four countries there. Today, he lands in Dublin, Ireland to meet with that nation's leaders. Tomorrow, the president travels to London, where he'll talk with British Prime Minister David Cameron and address the British Parliament. Then it's off to France for the G-8. That's a meeting of world economic powers. And the last stop: Warsaw, Poland. President Obama will meet with the Polish president and visit some of Poland's historic sites. Today, the president plans to take a side trip to visit some of his personal history: an Irish village where President Obama's great-great-great-grandfather lived. Iceland Volcano . AZUZ: From Ireland, we're hopping across the Northern Atlantic Ocean to Iceland. Something happening there might not affect President Obama's travel plans, but it was certainly having an impact on Iceland yesterday. A volcano erupted over the weekend; it sent a cloud of ash up into the sky. No flights were allowed in or out of the country's four international airports. This is one of the most active volcanoes in Iceland. Local media said it last erupted in 2004. Last year, another Icelandic volcano eruption -- you might remember this -- caused air travel problems across all of Europe. One official said she doesn't think this new eruption will have that kind of impact, although she said it's hard to predict how the ash cloud might move. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Rash's 6th grade classes at Grant County Middle School in Dry Ridge, Kentucky! Who performed the first American spacewalk? You know what to do! Was it: A) Ed White, B) Buzz Aldrin, C) Michael Collins or D) Alan Shepard? You've got three seconds -- GO! Ed White floated out of his Gemini capsule and into history in 1965. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Endeavour Spacewalk . AZUZ: Ed White's spacewalk in 1965 lasted 23 minutes. He said it wasn't nearly long enough. He might have preferred yesterday's spacewalk at the international space station. That one lasted more than eight hours! It was the sixth-longest spacewalk ever and the second one on this mission for the crew of the space shuttle Endeavour. This was the mission's first spacewalk. Happened back on Friday; lasted a little over six hours. You really get a good view of the astronauts moving around out there. What they've been doing is some routine maintenance. That includes working on a two-armed robot that will eventually take care of some of the work that astronauts are doing now. There are two more spacewalks planned for Endeavour's mission. Zombie Survival Kit . AZUZ: From walking in space to the walking dead. You don't hear much about this on CNN Student News. We're talking about a zombie apocalypse, and it brought down the Centers for Disease Control's website last week. That is because -- as a joke -- the CDC posted a zombie survival plan. And it was heavy traffic that crashed the internet site. The living dead might be taking over pop culture, but the government agency doesn't think there's any real threat from zombies. So we can all breathe easier. The reason it posted the survival plan was to raise awareness about preparing for disasters. The CDC says preparing for zombies would pretty much be the same as preparing for hurricanes or widespread disease. That includes stocking up on food, water, medicine; and having a battery-powered radio, plus some changes of clothes. Blog Report . AZUZ: Well, what's more fun than exams? Anything! But here are some tips that students have for getting through them. Gretchen tries to write everything down on paper and put a little drawing next to it, making it colorful. The color helps her absorb information better. Erik suggests this: record yourself reading the material, then listen to it every day in the morning and evening. It's like your own personal teacher. N'kayla's method: ""I use flash cards because they help me memorize things better."" Chia-sheng says, ""I review what I've learned right after class to have impressions of what's covered and what's important. Before tests, I just skim through the materials."" Keagan likes things quiet. ""It seems I can fit more into my head when I'm not distracted."" Reading the textbook and making a song throughout the chapter works for Calista. Jake goes to a certain room in his house and picks out something in that room to remember the information when he's taking the test. And Chelsea connects different types of music to different subjects and then breaks it into songs that fit the genre. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, a new museum invites visitors to dive in, 'cause that's the only way they can get there. It claims to be the world's largest underwater museum. It's located off the coast of Cancun, Mexico. The sculptures are made out of a special kind of cement that encourages coral reefs and marine life to grow. So if you visit several times, it'll actually look different each time. Of course, if you don't know to expect the changes, it might throw you for a loop. Goodbye . AZUZ: We guess it's a subject that deserves some in-depth exploration. You only have so long to make puns about underwater museums before the statue of limitations runs out. All right! Before we run out of time, we want to give a special shoutout to all you graduating seniors out there. Just two weeks left before we wrap up our school year.

"(CNN) -- A Yemeni man pleaded guilty to acts of piracy on Thursday for his role in the hijacking of a yacht off the coast of east Africa that resulted in the deaths of four Americans.

He ""willingly elected to join them in return for a share of the ransom money,"" but did not personally shoot or instruct to shoot any of the four Americans, the statement said. Americans Scott and Jean Adams, Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle were found shot to death when U.S. forces boarded the yacht.

"(CNN) -- Days after blocking a Gaza-bound flotilla, Greece's government offered Sunday to ship aid to the Palestinian territory -- a move applauded by the U.N. chief but derided as insufficient by protest organizers and Palestinian authorities. Greece's foreign ministry released a statement Sunday afternoon in which it proposed to ""undertake the task of transporting the humanitarian aid, with Greek vessels or other appropriate means, through existing channels."" That same day, Foreign Minister Stavros Lambrinidis talked by phone with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The U.N. chief ""thanked"" the Greek official and ""expressed support for the Greek initiative,"" according to a statement from the United Nations. ""In his view, it could help to reduce tensions in the region and ensure much-needed aid is delivered to those who need it in Gaza,"" the U.N. statement said of Ban's views, adding the world body will ""work closely with Greece, Israel and Palestinian authorities on this matter."" However, one Palestinian official, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat, said that funneling food, cement and other goods via other means, such as Greek ships, missed the point, which he said is to ""immediately lift, not ease"" Israel's maritime blockade of Gaza. He lauded those behind the flotilla as people ""who have dedicated their time, effort and passion for a just cause."" ""The situation in Gaza is not about border crossings,"" Erakat said Sunday in a statement. ""It is about the illegally denied and internationally recognized rights of the Palestinian people to dignity, freedom and self-determination."" A spokeswoman for The Audacity of Hope, a U.S. ship full of activists (but no humanitarian aid) that was barred last week by Greek authorities from sailing to Gaza, said the Greek offer ""doesn't really address the issue for us, (which is) ending the naval blockade."" ""It's all very well and good that there are some channels (for aid to Gaza),"" Leslie Cagan said. ""But that is not the same as lifting the siege of Gaza."" The vessel's captain, John Klusmire, remained in Greek custody on Sunday, one day after being asked to report to a police station. A spokesperson with the Greek Coast Guard, who was not named per custom, said Klusmire, an American, was arrested because he left the mainland without permission and put passengers in danger. He will appear before Greek prosecutors on Tuesday. Jane Hirschmann, one of the flotilla organizers, called the arrest ""intimidation"" aimed at likewise preventing the other nine boats in the flotilla from setting sail to Gaza. On Sunday, eight passengers from the U.S. ship began a hunger strike outside the U.S. Embassy in Athens, demanding their captain's release and allowing the ship to set sail. The vessel -- which carried 36 American passengers, four crew members and several journalists, including CNN reporter Phil Black -- was intercepted last Friday by a Greek Coast Guard patrol vessel roughly 10 minutes after it had departed Perama. After an hours-long standoff, the ship eventually returned to Greece, where it is tied up at a Greek naval facility. The Audacity of Hope and the nine other ships are aiming to promote public awareness about Israel's blockade of Gaza and, in part, to commemorate a May 2010 incident in which Israeli troops boarded Mavi Marmara, a Turkish ship filled with humanitarian aid and 700 activists from various countries. Nine people died in subsequent clashes with Israeli Navy commandos. Cagan said that while the American ship's crew are frustrated they haven't been able to head to Gaza, there is some degree of satisfaction that their cause has drawn attention and provoked debate worldwide. ""People went to Athens and still would like to complete the mission,"" said Cagan, who is in the United States but is in close contact with her fellow activists in Greece. ""At the same time, the feeling is very good that important work is being done that is shedding more light on the situation, with the whole blockade."" The Greek government has said it won't allow any of the boats in the flotilla to sail to Gaza because their mission is too dangerous. Flotilla members accuse the Greek government of buckling to pressure from Israel's government. For their part, the Israelis have said they are mounting a diplomatic offensive to try to stop the flotilla from setting sail at all. On Tuesday, the Israeli government said flotilla participants had threatened to kill Israeli military personnel should their boats be boarded. They said that the participants were stockpiling sacks of sulfuric acid on boats to be used in the event of any attacks on Israeli commandos. Flotilla organizer Medea Benjamin dismissed the allegations Tuesday as ludicrous, saying: ""They see this nonviolent, ragtag group of ships as such a threat they're using their entire propaganda apparatus, and their diplomatic and economic clout to try to stop 300 peace activists. It's pathetic."" The Middle East Quartet -- composed of officials from the United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia -- on Saturday issued a joint statement asking ""all governments concerned to use their influence to discourage additional flotillas, which risk the safety of their participants and carry the potential for escalation."" The Quartet added in its statement that it ""strongly urges all those wishing to deliver goods to the people of Gaza to do so through established channels, so that their cargo can be inspected and transferred via established land crossings."" Doing so, the group contends, is the best way to both help Palestinians and address Israel's ""legitimate security concerns."" On Sunday, Erakat said that while Palestinian leaders ""support international engagement in lifting the unjust and inhumane Israeli blockade,"" the Quartet's statement and their opposition to the planned flotilla to Gaza skirt the broader challenges in the region. ""We invite them to focus on resolving the root cause of the conflict, which is the occupation, rather than seeking ways to manage its destructive symptoms."" Erakat said of the Quartet. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","The Greek government offers to transport humanitarian aid to Gaza on its ships .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Monday temporarily blocking key provisions of a new Georgia law that aims to crack down on illegal immigration, while allowing other parts of the law to move forward. Most of the law, known as HB 87, was scheduled to go into effect Friday. U.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash Jr.'s ruling blocks enforcement of two of the most controversial sections of the law. ""State and local law enforcement officers and officials have no authorization to arrest, detain or prosecute anyone based upon sections 7 and 8 of HB 87 while this injunction remains in effect,"" Thrash ruled. Those sections would allow police to inquire about immigration status when questioning suspects in certain criminal investigations. They also would punish people who, during the commission of a crime, knowingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants. Something like speeding or driving without proper equipment could constitute a crime. ""The apparent legislative intent is to create such a climate of hostility, fear, mistrust and insecurity that all illegal aliens will leave Georgia,"" Thrash wrote. In his 45-page ruling, the judge cited a previous court decision that said preliminary injunctions were in the public interest ""when civil rights are at stake."" He also wrote that state officials were attempting to overstep federal authority on immigration enforcement. ""I'm very happy, as are all those who believe the Constitution is important,"" said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta attorney whose firm represented some of the plaintiffs. He said the stayed provisions were poorly written and that it was unclear how they would have been enforced, if allowed to move forward. Although the ruling was hailed as a victory by the plaintiffs, Thrash also tossed out a number of their arguments at the state's request, a point stressed by Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens soon after the decision. ""I appreciate the speed with which Judge Thrash ruled, given the complexity of the issues. I am pleased with the dismissal of the 4th Amendment, 14th Amendment, 'Right to Travel,' and Georgia constitutional claims by the plaintiffs -- even after this ruling, 21 of the 23 sections of HB 87 will go into effect as planned,"" Olens wrote in a statement. A part of the law that will still go into effect is a provision that workers convicted of using fake identification to get jobs could be sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $250,000. The law will also require people applying for public benefits to provide certain types of identification. Olens said his office will appeal the judge's ruling regarding sections 7 and 8. The office of Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, which supports the law, also weighed in on the judge's ruling. ""Beyond refusing to help with our state's illegal immigration problem, the federal government is determined to be an obstacle. The state of Georgia narrowly tailored its immigration law to conform with existing federal law and court rulings,"" said Brian Robinson, the governor's deputy chief of staff for communications. ""Georgians can rest assured that this battle doesn't end here."" The Georgia lawsuit is the latest battle in a nationwide skirmish between state and federal officials over who controls immigration enforcement. Arizona's controversial law aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration catapulted the issue onto the national stage last year, drawing a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice, which argues the law is unconstitutional. In April, a three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the Justice Department and against Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who signed Arizona's law last year. Brewer announced last month that the state would appeal directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. CNN's Gustavo Valdes and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","The state law is part of the broader nationwide immigration debate .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan got a temporary reprieve from a 120-day jail term for violating probation Friday, but the actress must immediately start court-ordered community service that should keep her busy for months. Lohan released from jail . While Lohan recently traveled to New York to discuss acting roles, including in the upcoming ""Gotti"" film, her next year could be spent in Los Angeles working on Skid Row, in court and behind bars. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner sentenced Lohan to jail and community service after deciding Friday that Lohan violated her probation when she was charged with stealing a necklace from a jewelry store in January. It's the latest punishment for Lohan in a four-year-long legal saga that started with two drunk driving convictions in 2007, followed by three judges ordering her to jail for probation violations in the past year. Unlike last September, when Lohan's entry into drug rehab convinced another judge not to enforce a jail sentence for a failed drug test, a rehab stint does not appear to be an alternative this time. Lohan has spent a total of eight months in rehab programs since the start of 2007 for treatment of a self-admitted substance abuse problem. Sautner made it clear she thought Lohan did not respect the previous judges who sent her to jail twice last year. ""She thumbs her nose at the court,"" Sautner said, referring to an incident last July that was caught by a courtroom camera. ""She walks into court with 'F U' on her fingernails. I don't know what that means unless it has 'I am' before it."" It would take Lohan three months of working five days a week, eight hours a day to complete the 480 hours community service Sautner ordered Friday, along with the four-month jail sentence. Her first job will be for 360 hours at the Downtown Women's Center on Skid Row in Los Angeles. Sautner suggested Lohan might behave better after seeing ""how truly needy women and women who have fallen on real hard times have to live."" Lohan must then work 120 hours at the Los Angeles County morgue, an assignment other drunk driving probationers have served. She still has a June 3 trial date for the necklace theft charge. The judge said she would ""give her an opportunity"" by reducing the felony to a misdemeanor. The opportunity may be for Lohan to accept a plea deal, something she rejected last month when she demanded a trial by jury. At the time, defense attorney Shawn Holley said she ""has a strong defense and we are confident that a jury will listen to the evidence fairly and acquit her."" Sautner was unimpressed with the defense presented at Friday's preliminary hearing. It centered on Holley arguing that Lohan was ""doing a million different things,"" including texting, when she walked out of the jewelry store with the gold and diamond necklace she had tried on 20 minutes earlier. Lohan was ""more scattered than crafty,"" Holley told the judge. The RidicuList: Lindsay Lohan . ""It's undisputed that Ms. Lohan walked out of the store with the necklace on,"" Holley said. The prosecution must show she had ""specific intent to permanently deprive the store of that necklace."" Holley conceded that Lohan ""did not rush to return the necklace,"" but she said it just ""makes her not a very considerate or courteous person,"" but not a thief. Sautner did not buy the defense argument. ""If in fact it was an accident, she could have called the store back,"" Sautner said. Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Danette Meyers called it a ""classic garden variety theft."" There was no mention Friday of the defense theory floated before the hearing that Lohan believed the store owner was loaning the necklace to her because she was a celebrity. Lohan's Friday ended with her posing for her fifth mugshot at Los Angeles County's Lynwood Correctional Facility, where she's been several times before. She was out after five hours when she posted the $75,000 bond set by Sautner. She can stay out of jail while Holley appeals the probation violation decision, but Sautner ordered her to immediately begin the community service work at the women's center.","Lohan must start work at Los Angeles' Downtown Women's Center .

"(CNN) -- Security forces have begun removing tanks from the volatile Syrian city of Hama, a sign that the tensions there could be easing. Ammar Qurabi, chairman of the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria and Omar Habbal, a prominent opposition activist in Hama told CNN that tanks just inside the city are withdrawing. Hama has been wracked with violence and a general strike this week after a series of peaceful demonstrations, including a huge anti-government demonstration on Friday. President Bashar al-Assad fired the Hama provincial governor on Saturday and security forces moved to the outskirts of the city. A fierce crackdown ensued in the area, with activists and Human Rights Watch reporting many arrests and deaths. Qurabi said 34 people were killed Tuesday and Wednesday alone. He and Habbal said the general strike called by activists several days ago continues with businesses, schools, and offices across the city closed. Residents have created security barriers to protect themselves. ""The city streets are deserted and it is difficult to move thorough the city because of the checkpoints set up on every corner by residents,"" Habbal said. Syria has denied that a military campaign was under way against Hama, even as human rights groups reported deaths, arrests and clashes on the outskirts of the city. ""The Syrian army did not enter and will not enter Hama,"" a Syrian government official told CNN Wednesday. ""The army is present at the city's entrances to facilitate the entry of government employees who live in the Hama countryside and work in government offices in the city; some people in Hama prevented them from entering the city by cutting off roads."" It is unclear whether Hama residents will turn out for nationwide demonstrations on Friday after Muslim prayers. The theme of the protests is ""no dialogue,"" a reference to the government-sponsored dialogue with the opposition members this weekend. Demonstrators are calling for all opposition leaders to boycott the initiative. Activists have said that, since mid-March, violence has been started by security personnel who have used brute force to break up peaceful demonstrations, but the Syrian regime has blamed ""armed groups"" for the bloodshed. The city is a sensitive spot for Syrian authorities. In 1982, it was the scene of a brutal military crackdown targeting Sunni Muslims by the Alawite-dominated government of Hafez al-Assad, President Bashar al-Assad's late father. Many thousands were killed, with Human Rights Watch putting the toll at 10,000.","Tanks said to be pulling back from Hama .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York billboard that focused exclusively on African-American abortion rates was taken down because of concerns for public safety, said Hal Kilshaw, spokesperson for Louisiana-based Lamar Advertising, on Thursday. The billboard was erected by group opposed to abortions. The billboard was attached to a building that houses the restaurant Lupe's Kitchen. Some of the wait staff, Kilshaw said, were being harassed by patrons who objected to the billboard. In addition, a scheduled protest Friday by people opposed to the billboard prompted public safety concerns, which led to the company's decision. Kilshaw said the controversy surrounding the billboard did not factor into the company's decision to take it down. ""We accepted the copy in accordance with our policy,"" Kilshaw said. ""We believe in people's right to advertise, [we] thought it [the copy] was OK, [and] we stand behind that decision,"" Kilshaw said. The sign, paid for by the organization Life Always, reads: ""The most dangerous place for an African-American is in the womb."" The billboard, about a half mile from a Planned Parenthood facility in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood, featured an African-American girl. ""They're attacking women for choosing abortion while simultaneously destroying family planning,"" a spokeswoman Mary Alice Carr of NARAL Pro-Choice America said before the billboard was taken down. ""Their hypocrisy is as large and as obnoxious as this billboard."" But Stephen Broden, a pastor and Life Always board member, told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday that ""it's hard to celebrate Black History Month"" with abortion ""hanging over our community."" ""Abortion is outpacing life in our community"" and he said the billboard's message is meant to be a ""provocative"" way to illustrate the problem. African-Americans have high abortion rates compared with other demographic groups, according to Rebecca Wind, a spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based research center for sexual and reproductive health. The disparity is in part attributed to a ""lack of adequate services"" in many black communities, which ""has resulted in more unintended pregnancies,"" Wind said. According to the Life Always website, the move is an attempt ""to raise public awareness of Life issues through advertising and raise truths about Life issues to educate and empower individuals."" The sign was part of a national campaign where more billboards will appear over the next couple of months across the country, Life Always spokeswoman Marissa Gabrysch said. Calls to Life Always and NARAL Pro-Choice America were not returned Thursday evening after news of the billboard's removal broke. Bill Donahue, Catholic League president, released a statement Thursday in support of the billboard. ""Life Always says it wants to raise public awareness of Planned Parenthood's war on black people. Good for them,"" he said. Critics say the message is misleading. ""The issue is here they are doing a campaign, targeting one group of women and making them feel guilty and shameful about family choices that they are making,"" Carr said. ""You can't take a woman and lift her out of her experience."" But the Rev. Derek A. McCoy, another Life Always board member, told reporters something needs to be done about abortion in the black community and this is ""calling attention to a dramatic event."" ""This is a truth and tragedy,"" he said. Broden said ""The child (in the billboard) was selected for her innocence.""","Billboard on African-American abortion rates was put up over Soho restaurant .

"Juba, Sudan (CNN) -- The president of Sudan will visit South Sudan when it marks its independence from the north on Saturday, a government official said Thursday. President Omar al-Bashir will make the trip as an expression of hope for ""brotherly relations"" between his government based in the north and South Sudan, his spokesman said. South Sudan is to become the world's newest country Saturday after South Sudan natives voted overwhelmingly in January for independence. The referendum to split was part of a 2005 peace deal to end decades of violence between the two sides. The planned visit comes amid tense relations between north and South Sudan. Violence erupted two months ago along the contested border area of Abyei and subsequently in South Kordofan, a state that lies north of the border but where many people, especially in the Nuba Mountains, are allied with the south. Thousands of people were displaced and many fear that after strict borders go into place with independence, they will not be able to return home. Critical issues -- including oil and the final status of Abyei -- remain unresolved days before the separation.","President Omar al-Bashir will visit South Sudan when it marks its independence .

"Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- As clashes in the Libyan capital continued Friday between government security forces and anti-regime protesters, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters unequivocally: ""The violence must stop."" His remarks came as state television was airing images of the embattled but defiant strongman urging viewers to defend the nation. A man CNN will identify only as Reda to protect his identity said in a telephone interview that armed men dressed in plainclothes fatally shot his two brothers Friday as they were demonstrating against the government. Also killed were his two neighbors, he said. ""The bodies have been kidnapped from the street,"" Reda said. ""My other neighbors told me they kidnapped the injured people in the hospital to somewhere, nobody knows (where). This is the perfect crime. He's hiding all evidence for every crime he has. This is the horrible situation that nobody knows."" More than 1,000 people have been killed, according to estimates cited Friday by Ban. He noted that the eastern part of the country ""is reported to be under the control of opposition elements, who have taken over arms and ammunition from weapon depots."" At least three cities near Tripoli have been the site of daily clashes, and the streets of the capital are largely deserted because people are afraid of being shot by government forces or militias, he said. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's supporters ""are reportedly conducting house-by-house searches and arrests. According to some reports, they have even gone into hospitals to kill wounded opponents,"" Ban said. Accounts from the news media and human rights groups and witnesses ""raise grave concerns about the nature and scale of the conflict,"" he said. He said they include reports of indiscriminate killings, shooting of peaceful demonstrators, torture of the opposition and use of foreign mercenaries. The victims have included women and children and ""indiscriminate attacks on foreigners believed to be mercenaries,"" he said, referring to reports. Ban called on the international community ""to do everything possible"" to protect civilians at demonstrable risk. Ban said there appeared to be a growing crisis of refugees, with some 22,000 people having fled to Tunisia and a reported 15,000 to Egypt in the past few days. For many, the trip has been a harrowing one. ""There are widespread reports of refugees being harassed and threatened with guns and knives,"" Ban said. ""The violence must stop,"" he said. ""Those responsible for so brutally shedding the blood of innocents must be punished. Fundamental human rights must be respected."" Ban said he will travel Monday to Washington to speak with U.S. President Barack Obama. Also at the United Nations, Libyan Ambassador Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham told reporters that he hoped Gadhafi and his sons would end the rampage ""against our people"" within hours. Asked why he had continued to support Gadhafi until just a few days ago, the diplomat said, ""I couldn't imagine in the beginning that it was going to be (this bad)."" But he now supports the protesters. ""It's not a crime to say, 'I want to be free,' "" he said. The Libyan ambassador to the United States, Ali Suleiman Aujali, told CNN that he too has joined the opposition. ""When I see the mercenaries killing our peoples, and we see our women screaming in the street, and I see there is no distinguishing between who they are target, I can't take this,"" said the diplomat, who served the Libyan government's foreign service for more than 40 years. He said his fellow diplomats and many of the country's police had also turned against Gadhafi in his quest to retain control of Libya. ""The problem now is western part,"" he said, speaking in Washington. ""Unfortunately, they've been confronted with mercenaries."" Asked whether he would want to see his former boss dead, he said, ""I want him to be out of my country. I want him to be out of the Libyan life."" As he spoke, reports emerged of sniper and artillery fire in Tripoli, said Mohammed Ali Abdallah of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, which opposes Gadhafi's regime. He based his account on reports that he said he received from witnesses. Another witness told CNN that protesters in western Tripoli were met by plainclothes security forces who fired guns at them and later tear gas to disperse the crowds. Prior to the clashes on Friday morning, security forces had removed barricades, disposed of bodies and painted over graffiti in Tripoli, witnesses said. On state television, Gadhafi -- wearing a fur trooper's hat and addressing a crowd of supporters -- threatened to escalate the violence. ""We can destroy any assault with the people's will, with the armed people,"" he said. ""And when it is necessary, the weapons depots will be open to all the Libyan people to be armed."" At that time, he continued, ""Libya will become a red fire, Libya will become an ember."" He vowed to overcome what he described as external forces attempting to take down his nation. ""We will defeat any foreign attempt like we defeated them before, like we did with the Italian colonization, like we did with American airstrikes."" But he presented a carrot with his stick, offering to increase state salaries by 150% and to give $400 to each family. Earlier, Gadhafi's son said his father has no intention of stepping down. Asked if Gadhafi has a ""Plan B"" to leave Libya, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi told CNN Turk: ""We have Plan A, Plan B, Plan C. Plan A is to live and die in Libya. Plan B is to live and die in Libya. Plan C is to live and die in Libya."" He said he hoped Libya would emerge from the crisis united. ""I am sure Libya will have a better future,"" he said. ""However, such a strong state as we are, we will never allow our people to be controlled by a handful of terrorists. This will never happen."" But global leaders were meeting Friday to talk about what kind of pressure can be brought on Gadhafi to surrender control and limit the humanitarian consequences. White House press secretary Jay Carney said Washington was suspending embassy operations in Tripoli and pursuing sanctions. ""It has been shuttered,"" he told reporters about the embassy. But State Department officials said they still have channels through which they can still communicate with the Libyan government. Libyan employees were remaining at the embassy, said Under Secretary ofState for Management Patrick Kennedy. ""The flag is still flying. The embassy is not closed. Operations are suspended,"" he said. ""Relations are not broken."" The charge d'affaires at the embassy, Joan Polaschik, expressed relief that she and other Americans had left. ""It's a very dangerous and fluid situation,"" she told CNN in a telephone interview from Istanbul, Turkey. But she praised the Libyan forces who were charged with providing security for the embassy. ""They stayed with me till the bitter end,"" she said. The United Nations Security Council discussed a proposed draft resolution that would impose new sanctions on Libya. They include an arms embargo, asset freeze and a travel ban. The draft also refers Libya to the International Criminal Court. An Obama administration official involved in deliberations regarding sanctions told CNN that the Libyan government has said it has as much as $130 billion in reserves and another $70 billion in foreign assets held abroad. The legally binding resolution is backed by the possible threat of force but approval of such measures could be stalled by Russia and China, both unlikely to support military intervention. A vote on the resolution could occur Saturday. NATO Secretary-General Anders Rasmussen said the alliance has assets that can be used in this crisis and that it could ""act as an enabler and coordinator, if and when, individual member states want to take action."" Meanwhile, foreign nationals faced a ""massive challenge,"" Rasmussen said, as they braved rough seas to escape the violence in the north African nation. A British ship left Benghazi -- the nation's second-largest city -- with 207 people on board. A ferry carrying 338 people -- 183 of them Americans -- departed Tripoli Friday and arrived in Malta at night. ""I feel for the people who are still there and didn't get a chance to get out, because it's chaos,"" said Yusra Tekbalim, one of the passengers. She said she had remained hunkered down in her house for four days, during which she heard what sounded like machine-gun fire. ""I think that the Libyans know what this regime is capable of, but I think for the first time the world is actually seeing it,"" she said. Another ferry arrived in Malta from Tripoli carrying more than 300 people, including 200 employees of Schlumberger, the oil and gas technology, and their families, a company spokeswoman said. Libya's uprising, after four decades of Gadhafi's iron rule, took root first in the nation's eastern province. Benghazi and other smaller eastern towns are no longer within Gadhafi's control. But closer to Tripoli, where the dictator maintains some support, protesters were still being met with brute force. The city of Zawiya -- about 55 kilometers (35 miles) west of Tripoli -- was the epicenter of violent protests Thursday. Doctors at a field hospital said early Friday that 17 people were killed and 150 more wounded when government forces attacked. CNN could not confirm reports for many areas in Libya. The Libyan government maintains tight control of communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country. CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone. Anti-government forces said they had gained control of Zawiya as Gadhafi accused followers of Osama bin Laden of adding hallucinogenic drugs to residents' drinks to spark the unrest. ""They put it with milk or with other drinks, spiked drinks,"" he said Thursday in a telephone call to state television. The international fallout, like the protests, has also spread. Switzerland ordered Gadhafi's assets frozen, the foreign ministry said. CNN's Yousuf Basil, Ben Wedeman, Saad Abedine, Richard Roth, John King, Whitney Hurst, Pam Benson, Ingrid Formanek and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","Gadhafi offers to increase state salaries and give families money .

"Birds Point, Missouri (CNN) -- Persistent, heavy rains have helped swell the Mississippi and Ohio rivers to the highest levels ever recorded, said an Army Corps of Engineers official Sunday. This ominous development prompted Maj. Gen. Michael Walsh, president of the Mississippi River Commission, to order several barges into place at 3 p.m. to begin pumping explosive slurry into a levee near where the two rivers meet. This is all in preparation -- if the decision is made -- to blow up the Birds Point-New Madrid levee and potentially flood 130,000 acres of Missouri farmland, in part to save the town of Cairo, Illinois. At 8 p.m., the water levels on the Ohio River outside Cairo had reached 60.27 feet -- well above the flood stage of 40 feet -- according to the National Weather Service. And, boosted by more rain, the forecast calls for a continued rise to as high as 61.5 feet by Tuesday afternoon. ""This is the largest flood that we have ever seen in our lifetimes,"" Walsh said. Two states divided by river, flooding . The U.S. Supreme Court refused Sunday to block any plan to intentionally breach the levee. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito ruled against Missouri -- effectively giving Walsh the authority to execute on the levee-breach plan. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster's office had appealed to the court, questioning the Corps' authority to do so. He had hoped to overturn a federal judge's ruling against Missouri on Friday, saying a 1928 law permits the breach of the levee to ease pressure on the river. Hours before the Supreme Court ruling came down, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon told reporters Sunday that he was not dwelling on the legal battle. Rather, he said that local and state authorities are focused first and foremost on making all necessary preparations, including steps to protect property and lives, assuming that the levee will be breached and massive flooding will occur. ""The litigation is out there, but that's not our focal point, quite frankly,"" Nixon said, flanked by Walsh. ""This doesn't thrill us, where we are, but this is a (difficult) situation. ... We understand the general and his team have difficult decisions to make."" Walsh said he'd directed crews to move the barges across the river to Missouri and load the pipes with the blasting agent. The entire process -- including priming the explosives and breaching the levee -- would take about 20 hours, at which point the controlled blast could occur. ""I have not given the command to put it into operation, just to get it to the next step,"" Walsh said. The crisis is centered on the stretch of the Mississippi River between Memphis and St. Louis, but it relates to a far broader issue of excess water in the river and its tributaries. Engineers have warned that should the rising waters of the Mississippi River overwhelm the entire flood control project, it could deluge cities, destroy crops, destroy businesses and paralyze river transportation. Engineers already have reported sand boils and seepage at a number of levees near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, a condition that Walsh said also threatens the integrity of the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project -- the world's largest flood control project. Belief Blog: Baptism in floodwaters . ""There is water in places where we have never ever seen it before,"" Walsh said. The potential for disaster -- and with the levees deteriorating and more rain falling -- prompted Cairo Mayor Judson Childs to order his city's 2,800 residents to evacuate by midnight Saturday. ""I'm here to try to protect the city of Cairo,"" Childs said. ""I care about them and I don't want them in harm's way. I would much rather issue a mandatory evacuation and nothing happen than not to do it and people lose their life."" Meanwhile, Missouri is likewise preparing for the worst -- specifically, the immersion or other negative effects on what Nixon called ""the most productive part of our continent"" for farming. About 750 National Guard personnel are in the area, with nearly 100 state police also on hand to safeguard the area and residents' property. In addition, 230 residents who were potentially in harm's way in Mississippi and New Madrid counties have been evacuated. ""The point is, if this is going to occur here, we're going to do it safely, we're going to do it an orderly fashion and we're going to do the best we can to defend it and save property where available,"" the governor said. The uncertain scenario threatened to turned the lives of thousands upside down. In Dexter, Missouri, Amanda Jones spent much of her Sunday morning in tears, bouncing from her computer to her phone and back again, pausing only to care for her sick toddler. She and others are concerned about the economic impact on Mississippi County -- and are even more worried about the unforeseen consequences if all doesn't go according to plan and water inundates the nearby Missouri towns of New Madrid, Charleston, Wyatt and East Prairie. Residents are being told a second levee built to protect the towns will hold, but ""they really have no clue what's going to happen,"" Jones said. And even out of the flood plain, she said she's worried an explosion may trigger an earthquake on the New Madrid Fault, which runs through the region. Jones posted on her Facebook page a transcript of a 1988 public meeting in which it was discussed that such a plan could go awry, as the force of the water would be uncontrollable after such a breach and the second levee cannot be guaranteed. ""As we all know too well, plans don't always go according to plan, especially when Old Man River is involved,"" board member Lester Goodin said, according to the transcript. ""It has time after time fooled people who weren't fools, people who merely miscalculated, or failed to take into account its almost infinite variables, or used inadequate models, or out-of-date models, or mistaken assumptions."" In East Prairie, Cassie Sutton isn't waiting around to find out. Her family's bags are packed, she said Sunday. And should word be given that the levee will be blown up, they plan to head to stay with relatives about 45 minutes away. ""They did say the secondary levee will hold, but we've also never been in times like these,"" she said. ""... I'm not willing to be the guinea pig. That's the bottom line."" Sutton said her aunt and uncle have evacuated two homes near the levee, moving out all their possessions, and are now living in a camper. ""They honestly think they'll have nothing to go back to,"" she said, adding the Corps of Engineers has told them the water will cover their home by at least 5 or 6 feet. The levee was breached before, in 1937. But, Jones and Sutton pointed out, the area was heavily forested then, with trees to slow the water before it reached the second levee. That forestation is no longer there, they said. Koster's office said last week that ""the flooding would leave a layer of silt on the farmland that could take as much as a generation to clear, causing significant injury to the quality of the farmland for many years."" Still, even if they don't prefer it, not everyone in the Show-Me State opposes the levee breach if it's truly a last resort. Sutton said her family has traditionally made its living farming, but ""when it comes over people's lives to farmland, I say save the lives."" ""They say it's going to help Cairo, then I'm for it,"" she said. ""But I have a feeling that will destroy Mississippi County, financially bankrupt our county.""

"(CNN) -- Jury selection begins Thursday for an Army sergeant charged in what military authorities say was a conspiracy by a group of soldiers to kill Afghan civilians for sport and then cover it up. Sgt. Darren Jones is one of 12 soldiers, all members of the Washington-based 5th Stryker Combat Brigade, accused in a case that strained U.S. relations with Afghanistan after details emerged that some of the soldiers allegedly posed with dead Afghans and collected souvenirs from the killings. Jones is one of six soldiers facing trial and the only one not charged with killing Afghans. Six other soldiers, including one who posed for photos with a dead Afghan, have accepted plea deals. Jones, who faces courts-martial at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and conspiracy to commit assault and battery. The government maintains that sometime in March 2010, Jones along with other soldiers opened fire on three Afghan men near Forward Operating Base Ramrod, in the volatile Kandahar province in southern Afghanistan. The Army charge sheet, which spells out the allegations against Jones, does not provide the date of the shooting, the identities of the victims or whether they were wounded. There is no evidence Jones killed or wounded any Afghan civilians, his lawyer, Kevin McDermott, told CNN late Wednesday . ""They're calling it aggravated assault, even though he didn't hit anybody,"" McDermott said. ""There is no forensic evidence, no ballistic, no bodies, no identities."" A telephone call by CNN late Wednesday to the prosecutor's office at Joint Base Lewis-McChord went unanswered. The military also alleges that Jones, 30, of Brea, California, joined others in his unit in the May 2010 beating of a fellow soldier to prevent him from talking to investigators about the killings and other misconduct at the base in southern Afghanistan. McDermott said Jones was never interviewed by military investigators about his alleged role. The government alleges the killing-for-sport plan was hatched by Staff Sgt. Calvin R. Gibbs, 25, of Billings, Montana, and that the group began killing civilians in January 2010. The case drew international outrage in March when Der Spiegel, a German news magazine, published photos that showed two of the accused -- Spec. Jeremy Morlock and Pfc. Andrew Holmes -- posing over dead bodies of Afghans. The U.S. Army apologized for any distress caused by the photos, calling the photographs ""repugnant to us as human beings and contrary to the standards and values of the United States Army."" Army officials asserted in the statement that ongoing court-martial proceedings related to the alleged atrocities ""speak for themselves. The photos appear in stark contrast to the discipline, professionalism and respect that have characterized our soldiers' performance during nearly 10 years of sustained operations."" In March 2011, Morlock of Wasilla, Alaska, pleaded guilty to killing Afghan civilians in a deal that sentenced him to 24 years in prison and positioned him to be the prosecution's key witness against the other soldiers still facing trial. Among those facing murder charges are Holmes of Boise, Idaho; Spec. Adam Winfield of Cape Coral, Florida; Spec. Michael Wagnon of Las Vegas and Gibbs. Holmes is charged with the premeditated deaths of three civilians, possessing a dismembered human finger, wrongfully possessing photographs of human casualties and smoking hashish. He is also accused of conspiring with Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then toss a grenade so it would look like the soldiers were under attack. Authorities allege Gibbs kept finger bones, leg bones and a tooth from Afghan corpses. Wagnon allegedly kept a skull from a corpse, according to charging documents. All five accused in the killings have pleaded not guilty.","Sgt. Darren Jones has pleaded not guilty .

"(CNN) -- Boxing world champion Wladimir Klitschko has told CNN that David Haye will become the 50th knockout victim of his career when the two face-off in July. The IBF, IBO and WBO heavyweight champion is set to face WBA champ Haye in Hamburg, Germany, on July 2 in a bid to unify four of the division's five belts. The Ukrainian recently pulled out of his scheduled April 30 fight with another British boxer, Derek Chisora, and boasts a formidable record during his 15-year career, winning 55 of his 58 fights -- 49 coming via knockout. And he claims Haye is the perfect man to help him notch up a landmark half century. He told CNN: ""I knocked out 49 fighters and David Haye is going to be the 50th on my list. I am looking forward to it, I will get a great challenge in the ring. ""He will try to get through with his strategy, psychological and physical game and I'm ready for it because I'm a true professional athlete and have been doing it for such a long time. I love to be challenged."" Londoner Haye can also point to an impressive record in the sport, having won 25 of his 26 fights, 23 coming via knockout. The 30-year-old moved up from the Cruiserweight division in 2008 and has made public his desire to fight Wladimir, and his older brother, the WBC heavyweight champion Vitali, before he retires on his birthday -- October 13 this year. When Wladimir was asked what would happen if Haye was to win their July bout, he replied: ""(Defeat) is not an option -- myself and Vitali are going to unify all the belts. ""Haye is quick and his record speaks for itself. He won a lot of fights by knockout, so I will not underestimate his speed or his punching power. ""I've been in boxing for last 15 years and I'm going to be close to 60 fights, I know exactly what to expect from every single opponent."" Wladimir also denied that he will enjoy any advantage from the fact that the contest will be staged in Germany -- the country that has hosted many of his title fights in the past. He explained: ""It's not really an advantage because the ring is the same everywhere -- it has four corners with a referee in between you and your opponent. ""It's all about the way you fight and how you follow through with your plan and tactics.""","Wladimir Klitschko tells CNN that David Haye will be his 50th knockout victim .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A former Army commander who underwent a sex change operation was discriminated against by the U.S. government, a federal judge ruled Friday in an important victory for transgenders claiming bias in the workplace. Diane Schroer won her federal lawsuit against the Library of Congress after officials backed out of a 2005 job offer when told of her intention to become a transsexual. At the time of the job interview for a position as a senior terrorism research analyst, David Schroer was a male. He had been a onetime Army Special Forces commander. U.S. District Court Judge James Robinson said Schroer's civil rights were violated. ""The evidence established that the Library was enthusiastic about hiring David Schroer -- until she disclosed her transsexuality,"" Robinson wrote. ""The Library revoked the offer when it learned that a man named David intended to become, legally, culturally and physically, a woman named Diane. This was discrimination 'because of ... sex.' "" The judge will later rule on what financial damages Schroer is due. ""It is especially gratifying that the court has ruled that discriminating against someone for transitioning is illegal,"" said Schroer in a statement from the ACLU, which represented her in court. ""I knew all along that the 25 years of experience I gained defending our country didn't disappear when I transitioned, so it was hard to understand why I was being turned down for a job doing what I do best just because I'm transgender. It is tremendously gratifying to have your faith in this country, and what is fundamentally right and fair, be reaffirmed."" After Schroer had retired from the military, she applied for a job at the Library of Congress. Court records show that Schroer, then a male, took her future boss to lunch to outline her transition to a female, as she planned to present herself as a female on her first day of the job. Schroer testified that on the day after the lunch, the job offer was rescinded, and she was told she wasn't a ""good fit"" for the library. The ACLU said the ruling sends a ""loud and clear"" message to employers against firing or refusing to hire someone for changing their gender. There was no immediate reaction from the library, which had claimed at trial that transgender people are not covered under federal anti-discrimination laws. The case is Schroer v. Billington (Cv-05-1090).","Officials rescinded job offer after learning of transition .

"Phuket, Thailand (CNN) -- When Southeast Asia was rocked by a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2004, Susanne Janson was glued to her television in Stockholm, Sweden. Her two daughters -- 14-year-old Eleonor and 12-year-old Josefin -- were vacationing in Thailand at the time with her ex-husband and his new family, and she hadn't heard any news of their whereabouts because phone lines were unreliable. With such a lack of information, it didn't take long for Janson and her partner, Hans Forssell, to hop on a plane. ""I was so sure that when we arrived in Thailand, I would have a (text) message telling me that I could come back home because we missed each other in the air,"" Janson recalls. ""Unfortunately, I didn't have that message."" When Janson and Forssell arrived in Khao Lak, the city her daughters were staying in, they learned that it had been one of Thailand's hardest-hit areas. ""There was nothing left ... everything had disappeared,"" Janson said. Eventually, she had to face a tragic reality: that her daughters had perished along with their father and three other members of his family. ""When I realized I wouldn't bring them back home alive, I wanted to die,"" said Janson, 47. Grief-stricken, and with no interest in returning to her advertising career, Janson was lost. But she frequently remembered the support and grace offered to her by the Thai people in their time of mutual crisis. So when she read that a Thai-Swedish couple she'd met were building an orphanage in Phuket for children who'd lost their families in the tsunami, she decided she wanted to help. ""I felt a connection with the Thai people,"" Janson said. ""They had suffered so much more than I suffered. Here, you had people that lost children, homes, everything, and they were strong. So I think that affected me, and their kindness to me was such that I wanted to give something back."" In March 2005, Janson and Forssell returned to Thailand as volunteers at the orphanage, and in 2006 they made their stay permanent. They sold their Swedish apartment and became the managers of Barnhem Muang Mai, a care home that has helped more than 100 children to date. For the first year, the facility cared for children and families directly affected by the tsunami. But as relatives reconnected after the tragedy, the original beneficiaries moved on and Barnhem's mission evolved. Although Barnhem means ""orphanage"" in Swedish, Janson says Barnhem is no longer an orphanage in the traditional sense. ""It's a home for children and ... families actually in need,"" she said. ""We don't just help children. If we can help a child ... by helping mother or grandmother and keep them together, that's even better than just (helping) the child."" All of the children at Barnhem come from dire poverty, and they've often endured abuse, crime or neglect. While most have no one else to care for them, some do. And whenever possible, Janson works to keep families together. Barnhem currently houses 24 children, one mother and one grandmother, providing daily ongoing care. ""Love is the first thing they need,"" she said. ""Second (is) food ... but then it's school and education."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . Janson and Forssell have learned to speak Thai fairly well, and with the help of their Thai co-manager, nicknamed Wow, they strive to give the children a real home with all of the love, household chores and homework that come with it. ""We want to be as close to a family as possible,"" Janson said. ""Of course, we can't do it all the way, as we are a very big family. ... (But) when something is good, we are happy together. If something bad happens, we cry together. That's the most important if you work with children. Not so much head, but a lot of heart."" Education is also an important part of the Barnhem home, which is funded by charities, foundations and private individual donations. Janson ensures that a teacher visits after school to tutor youngsters who need extra support. ""We can't decide what they should do with their lives,"" she said. ""But by helping them with education, we hope that we can help them have a choice."" In June, Barnhem achieved an important milestone. Fame, a teenage boy who's lived at the home since 2006, started college. After he passed his entrance exam, Janson found a Swedish family to sponsor his studies. She is excited about what it means for his future and that of the other children in her care. ""We hope we can help the other kids understand that they actually can change their lives,"" she said. While Janson has made a new life and family for herself in Thailand, her daughters -- whose remains eventually were found in Khao Lak -- are never far from her mind. ""I think I feel closer to them here than I do in Sweden. I don't know why,"" she said. ""I think of them every day. ... ""My daughters loved their life. And I wanted to show them that I would survive this. And if (I) could help my new children to love their lives, at least one good thing came out of this."" Want to get involved?

"London (CNN) -- Lawyers for WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange have filed an appeal against his extradition to Sweden to face questioning on sex charges, a member of his defense team said Thursday. The appeal was submitted to London's High Court on Tuesday, but lawyers do not expect the case to be heard for another two or three months, said Jennifer Robinson, who is part of Assange's defense team. A judge at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court ruled on February 24 that Assange should be extradited from the United Kingdom to Sweden to face allegations of sex crimes. He says the charges are an attempt to smear him. The case is not related to the work of Assange's website, which facilitates the publication of secret information. It made headlines last year for leaking documents and videos related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables. At a news conference after the judge's extradition ruling last month, he lashed out at the decision. He said to thrust someone into a foreign land where someone does not speak the language or understand the judicial system ""is a very grave matter."" Assange has not been charged with a crime, but Swedish prosecutors want to question him in connection with sexual misconduct allegations related to separate incidents in August. Assange denies the accusations. His attorneys are fighting his extradition on procedural and human-rights grounds. Judge Howard Riddell, however, dismissed almost all the arguments by the defense. He ruled that the allegations against Assange are extraditable offenses. He disagreed with Assange's lawyers that Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny did not have the authority to issue a European arrest warrant and ruled that the warrant was valid. Riddell also tossed out claims that Assange would not be able to obtain a fair trial in Sweden or that Swedish prosecutors had not made any effort to promptly interview Assange before he left Sweden last year. ""In fact this is untrue,"" the judge said in the ruling. He said Assange's Swedish lawyer Bjorn Hurtig had made a ""deliberate attempt to mislead the court"" and that it was Assange who had avoided interrogation before he left Sweden. ""It would be a reasonable assumption from the facts that Mr. Assange was deliberately avoiding interrogation before he left Sweden,"" Riddell wrote. Assange's lawyers have raised the possibility that Sweden would hand him over to the United States if Britain extradites him to Sweden. Prosecutor Clare Montgomery, representing Sweden, has dismissed that claim. CNN's David Wilkinson and Andrew Carey contributed to this report.","WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange is fighting extradition to Sweden over sex allegations .

"(CNN) -- A small plane went down short of an airport in rural Alabama, killing a couple and five of their children, authorities said. ""It's going to take a long time (to investigate) since the wreckage is so deep in the woods,"" Nick Worrell of the National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday night. The NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration are looking into the deadly crash, which occurred Saturday evening near Demopolis, Alabama. According to preliminary information, the Cessna C421 was flying from St. Louis to Destin, Florida, when it lost its right engine, said the FAA's Kathleen Bergen. The plane was diverted to Demopolis Municipal Airport but crashed about two miles short of the runway, Bergen said. Seven people were on board the plane, according to Bergen. All seven died. Marengo County Coroner Stuart Eatmon told CNN the father was the pilot. The wife and at least five children perished in the crash, he said. The bodies were burned ""beyond recognition,"" he said. Eatmon said it took hours for officials to remove the victims from the plane. The wreckage was discovered around 2 a.m. Sunday, but rescue workers could not remove the bodies for about 12 hours because they had to wait for the plane to cool down.  Officials had to use an infrared camera to locate the bodies, he said. Authorities are waiting to release the names of the victims until family members have been notified.

"London, England (CNN) -- Baggage handlers and check-in staff at Heathrow Airport threatened Wednesday to strike during the week of Christmas, as British Airways went to court to try to stop a strike called by its cabin crews. The planned industrial action looked set to throw one of the world's busiest airports into chaos over Christmas -- while United Kingdom-based drivers of the Eurostar train announced they would go on strike at the same time. British Airways hopes a London court will order cabin crews to stay on the job, despite a vote by 92 percent of members of the Unite union to walk out. The strike could threaten 1 million passengers' holiday travel plans. BA made its case before Judge Laura Cox at London's High Court Wednesday. Unite also is expected to present its views Thursday and the judge could rule the same day. The airline held emergency talks with union leaders even as it sought the court order to block the 12-day walkout. The two sides talked for about four hours on Wednesday afternoon, a BA spokeswoman told CNN, without disclosing the contents of the discussions. She declined to be named. BA is challenging the Unite union's ballot of its 12,500 cabin crew members, arguing that some workers who had taken voluntary redundancy -- or buyouts -- took part in the voting even though they would have left the airline by the time the strike took place. Unite, which said British Airways cabin crews will strike from December 22 to January 2, also announced the threat of the second air travel strike as BA fought its case in court. Baggage handlers and check-in staff at Heathrow and at Aberdeen airport in Scotland will strike next week unless there is movement on resolving a pay dispute, Unite announced. The strike is not related to the BA dispute. The baggage handlers and check-in staff are employed by SAS Ground Services UK Ltd. Unite said the strike would affect travelers on Turkish, Emirates and Thai airlines at Heathrow and passengers on KLM, Air France, Wideroe and Atlantic at Aberdeen. The walkout, which is over pay and pensions, is scheduled for December 22 to 24, December 26 to 27 and January 3 to 4, 2010. SAS said it was preparing a statement in response. Opening the British Airways hearing at London's High Court, the airline's legal counsel, Bruce Carr, told the presiding justice that the balloting process contained ""serious and substantial irregularities."" He called the union's action in choosing to strike over Christmas ""willfully disproportionate and clearly unlawful."" Carr referred several times to the serious disruption that will be felt by the airline's passengers, saying some ""ordinary people will find it very difficult to understand."" Passengers angry and despairing . Meanwhile the Unite union said it had accepted an offer from British Airways to meet for talks Wednesday afternoon. ""We are pleased the company has seen sense and will meet with us to seek an opportunity to get the talks back on track,"" union spokeswoman Pauline Doyle told CNN. Those talks do not affect the airline's attempt to seek an injunction to prevent the strike. Unite union members voted in November to walk out because of planned changes to cabin crew conditions. The union's Deputy General Secretary Len McCluskey announced the result of the ballot Monday. The strike vote came after the airline introduced cost-cutting measures, including a two-year pay freeze and reducing the numbers of cabin-crew members on long-haul flights. Tell us about your BA travel troubles . British Airways says the changes, introduced in the wake of a record pre-tax loss of more than $485 million for the six months from April to September, will save the airline $665 million. Meanwhile, Eurostar train drivers based in the United Kingdom announced Wednesday they will strike Friday and Saturday, and again December 26 and 27. Eurostar, however, said service would not be affected, because drivers from France and Belgium would be used. The train line provides service between London and both Paris, France, and Brussels, Belgium. Talks between the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and Eurostar ""concerning international allowances"" broke down, the union said. The dispute is over how much drivers' meal allowances should be when they are in Paris and Brussels. A Eurostar spokeswoman said it offered the drivers what it believes is a reasonable amount, but the drivers rejected the offer. She would not divulge specifics of the offer, saying only that it was ""enough for a good meal."" Separately, the International Air Transport Association, an umbrella group for the air travel industry, predicted Tuesday that the world's airlines will lose $5.6 billion in 2010. That's more than the group's previous prediction of a $3.8 billion loss in 2010, but still only half as much as it expects the industry to lose this year. ""The world's airlines will lose $11 billion in 2009,"" said Giovanni Bisignani, the association's director general and CEO, in a statement. ""Between 2000 and 2009, airlines lost $49.1 billion, which is an average of $5 billion per year."" Analysts warn strike could wreck BA . If the BA strike goes forward, passengers will find themselves unable to take their flights or be stranded at their destinations, unable to return home, said travel expert Simon Calder of The Independent newspaper on CNN's ""Quest Means Business"" Tuesday. British Airways has said passengers holding tickets for the strike period may rebook for any date in the next 12 months with no penalty, but ticketholders still hoping to fly over the holidays are faced with a dilemma. What's the advice for travellers affected by the strike? The airline has said it will refund a passenger's ticket only if their flight is canceled, and so far it has not canceled any flights because of the strike. Passengers not willing to wait to see whether their flight will be canceled can try to rebook on another airline, but British Airways has said it will not reimburse them for the cost of that ticket if their original flight goes ahead as planned. There is little availability on other airlines, and any tickets are likely to be expensive, Calder said. Follow news of strike on Twitter .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani court has indicted six soldiers and one civilian on murder and terrorism charges in the death of an unarmed man whose fatal shooting was caught on video. The seven men pleaded not guilty, said Muhammad Khan, a public prosecutor in a special anti-terrorism court in the southern city of Karachi. Teenager Sarfraz Shah was shot and killed by Rangers providing security at a public park this month. A chilling video of the incident was played repeatedly on national television and became the latest in a series of human rights violations that horrified Pakistanis and eroded public confidence in security agencies. In the video, an unarmed Shah begs not to be shot. He pleads with the men carrying automatic rifles. ""I am helpless,"" he cries. ""Please do not fire."" Then, two shots and screams of pain. Blood streams out onto the ground beneath him. The Rangers are Pakistan's paramilitary force primarily responsible for border protection, but at the request of provinces, it helps to maintain law and order in cities. Karachi police said Shah tried to rob people at a park named in honor of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto by pointing a pistol and trying to steal cash and cell phones. He was handed over to park security and then to the Rangers. A hearing on the case begins Thursday.

"(CNN) -- Barry H. Landau is recognized as one of the foremost collectors of presidential artifacts and memorabilia, having worked with every White House since the Lyndon Johnson administration. Now police in Baltimore are accusing him and another man of stealing millions of dollars worth of historical documents from the Maryland Historical Society. Landau and Jason Savedoff are accused of stealing documents from the society's museum library after an employee thought the pair exhibited suspicious behavior. According to a Baltimore Police Department report, the employee said he watched Savedoff take a document, conceal it in a portfolio and walk out of the library with it on Saturday. The employee then called police. The report states 60 documents were found in Savedoff's locker near the library, some of which were signed out by Landau. The men were found to be in possession of documents signed by President Abraham Lincoln valued at $300,000, along with signed commemorations of both the Statue of Liberty and the Washington Monument, each valued at $100,000. The recovered documents also included several presidential inaugural ball invitations and programs with an estimated value of $500,000, according to the police report. ""These are only four (4) of the (60) documents recovered from Mr. Landau and Mr. Savedoff,"" the police report stated. ""The staff of the Maryland Historical Society advised that the other 56 documents are of the same approximate value."" Baltimore police say the FBI has also started an investigation. Maryland Historical Society President Burt Kummerow said he is proud of how the museum handled the situation and is pleased the documents have been returned. ""It would have been a huge loss because then (the documents) are no longer in the public record and then they're no longer available,"" he said. Dozens of people enter the museum's special collections unit every day to view original artifacts and conduct research. ""We're in business to study the history of Maryland, and that's why people come in,"" Kummerow said. ""But there are others who would love to collect important documents and own them."" Landau is the author of ""The President's Table: Two Hundred Years of Dining and Diplomacy."" Earlier this month, he told CNN he has collected more than a million presidential objects. In a July 4 piece, Landau discussed how various presidents displayed the American flag and how aides went about positioning them. ""I would like to be appointed to some national position to assure that there will be a resurgence of the flag pole on every new building, and the American flag more prominently displayed on a day to day basis,"" Landau said in an interview for the ""In The Arena"" blog.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A federal judge ruled Tuesday that there is enough evidence that former reality TV producer Bruce Beresford-Redman murdered his wife at a Cancun resort to justify his return to Mexico to face trial. Beresford-Redman, once a producer on TV's ""Survivor,"" will appeal the extradition order to a higher court, which could keep him in the United States for another year, his defense lawyers said. Mexican prosecutors charged Beresford-Redman last year with the aggravated murder of Monica Burgos Beresford-Redman while the couple and their two young children vacationed at a resort. The defense withdrew its request to have the 6-year-old daughter take the stand at Tuesday's extradition hearing because of ""some concerns about her ability to testify today,"" lawyer Vicki Podberesky said.  The situation was ""very upsetting"" to the child, she said. Instead, the judge allowed the defense to use a sworn statement from the child's counselor that quoted her saying she never saw her parents argue of fight during the vacation. The child's statements to her therapist were also used to explain how her father got some cuts and scrapes on his body that investigators said indicated he was in a struggle with his wife. Beresford-Redman, who has been in jail in Los Angeles since November, has been allowed to visit with his children each week, his lawyer said. He will apparently attend a probate court hearing this week in a Los Angeles County courthouse across the street from federal court.  The federal judge approved the request that he testify before the judge considering the permanent custody of his children and the control of his estate.. Mexican prosecutors contend that Beresford-Redman killed his wife by asphyxiating her in their room at the Moon Palace Resort on April 5, 2010. Beresford-Redman's lawyers accuse Mexican investigators of rushing to judgment in charging the husband because they wanted to protect Cancun's valuable tourist industry. The case is ""replete with inconsistencies and unsupported innuendos,"" attorney Richard Hirsch said. The Cancun trip was intended to help the couple work out their marital problems caused by the producer's affair with another woman, his lawyers said. But prosecutors contend it was murder, not reconciliation, on Beresford-Redman's mind. ""The fugitive's continued infidelity provides a strong motive for him to have committed the crime,"" U.S. prosecutors wrote in an extradition filing. ""The fugitive's affair was still an issue with the couple during their trip."" The fact that he brought their young son and daughter along supports his innocence, Hirsch said. ""How absurd it is to think that our client, or anyone, would book a trip to Mexico with his two minor children, have a room in which all of them, the whole family, is staying together, and have this with some motive to commit a homicide,"" Hirsch said. ""It makes no sense in logic, whatsoever."" Prosecution documents describe a loud argument ending with a violent death in the same one-room hotel suite where the children were staying. While investigators have not talked to the children, a therapist who has helped them deal with the loss of their mother did question the daughter about her memories of the Mexico trip, Hirsch said. An affidavit signed by the therapist said the girl told her she never heard her parents argue in Mexico and that she was never left alone at the resort. ""Mommy and Daddy did not yell at each other and never hit each other,"" the statement quotes the daughter saying. ""Mommy and Daddy never hit each other anywhere, anytime.""","NEW: Defense lawyers say they will appeal the extradition decision .

"Orlando (CNN) -- The detectives who built the murder case against Casey Anthony said Tuesday they stand behind their evidence but urge the public to respect the jury's verdict of acquittal. ""In any case -- especially a case with this many witnesses and this much evidence -- you can always look back and improve on what you have done,"" Orange County Sheriff's Office Sgt. John Allen told reporters. ""I don't know if anybody up here can think of anything we could have done differently that would change the outcome."" Anthony was acquitted last week of killing her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, but convicted of four misdemeanor counts of lying to investigators.

Anthony, 25, was given the maximum sentence on each of the misdemeanor counts -- a total of four years. But with credit for the time she has spent jailed since her 2008 arrest, she is slated to be released Sunday. ""I think all of us respect the jury system, and we respect the jury's verdict,"" Allen said. ""I would hope that people who followed us, people in the community, would also respect the jury's verdict and our process. ""But for us, I certainly don't have any doubt after working on this,"" he said. ""I felt our case was solid."" Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said that despite the ""plethora of chatter"" surrounding the controversial verdict, investigators have not received any ""credible threats"" to Anthony and won't offer any special protection to her upon release. In a case built on circumstantial evidence, prosecutors accused Anthony of using chloroform to render her daughter unconscious, then duct-taping her mouth and nose to suffocate her. They alleged that she put the child's body in the trunk of her car for a few days before disposing of it. Her lawyers argued that Caylee accidentally drowned in the Anthony family's above-ground pool, and that Casey Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked and covered up the death -- something George Anthony denied on the witness stand. The case began drew national attention in part because Anthony failed to report Caylee missing for a month, during which she moved out of her parent's home, partied in Orlando nightclubs and shopped. When confronted, she accused a nonexistent nanny of taking the girl. Caylee's skeletal remains weren't found until December 2008, six months after she was last seen alive. If her body had been discovered earlier, ""I would like to say that maybe more evidence would have been found,"" Allen said. ""But it's impossible to say."" Anthony's scattershot defense included challenges to forensic evidence; allegations that she had been molested by her father; an attempt to cast suspicion on the meter reader who discovered the girl's body; and an unsuccessful attempt to call her own competency to stand trial into question. Ultimately, however, lead attorney Jose Baez argued that the prosecution's case failed to show how the girl died, and left jurors with ""more questions than you have answers."" Allen said detectives had no evidence beyond ""Casey's word"" that her father had sexually abused her -- an allegation George Anthony also denied in his sometimes-emotional testimony. And Melich said Casey Anthony never said anything about an accident when she was questioned by police about her daughter's disappearance. ""That would have been her opportunity to say so, had it been,"" Melich said. He added, ""Even to this day, I'm still surprised that she just didn't come off it, she wouldn't tell us the truth."" ""That's all we were after, was the truth -- that day, this whole thing could have ended had we known the truth.""","NEW: No ""credible threats"" to Anthony despite anger, sheriff says .

"(CNN) -- Norwegian marathon runner Grete Waitz, winner of a record nine New York City marathons, has died at the age of 57 following a six-year fight with cancer. Waitz, who had been undergoing treatment for cancer since 2005, died overnight on Tuesday in hospital in Norway's capital Oslo, according to Helle Aanesen, co-founder of Waitz's Active Against Cancer Foundation. She won her first New York title in 1978 setting a world record time of two hours, 32 minutes and 30 seconds. The last of her nine wins -- more than any other athlete, male or female, at the event -- came in 1988, by which time she had also won the London marathon twice (1983 and 1986). Waitz took marathon gold at the inaugural world athletics championships at Helsinki in 1983 and picked up the silver medal at the Los Angeles Olympics the following year. International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) president Lamine Diack described Waitz as ""one of the brightest flames of the modern athletics era,"" AFP reported. ""The dedication, perseverance and fortitude with which Grete carved out her athletics career on the track, across the country and on the road is an example to us all, as is the positive way she tackled the illness that beset her life in recent years,"" he said, AFP reported. Waitz's talents extended to other distances as well. She won the world cross-country title five times and twice broke the 3,000 meter world record -- in 1975 and 1976. In her native Norway she won a total of 33 national championships across a range of distances. Svein Arne Hansen, head of the Norwegian athletics federation called her ""the greatest Norwegian athlete of all times"" and ""a model for women's sport,"" AFP reported.","Marathon great, Grete Waitz dies of cancer aged 57 .

"Washington (CNN) -- A same-sex couple has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in a cross-state dispute over their efforts to have both of them officially listed as the parents of an adopted 5-year-old boy. The California couple filed an appeal this week with the high court, saying Louisiana, where the child was born, has an unconstitutional policy against adoption by unmarried couples. The state used that policy to justify naming only one of them on an amended birth certificate. The men, Oren Adar and Mickey Ray Smith, argue that gay couples have a due process right to be listed on such certificates as joint custodial parents. A federal appeals court has ruled against the couple. The case could have broader implications in the current legal fight in state and federal courts over same-sex marriage and whether states -- and Washington -- must honor legal rights that gays and lesbians enjoy in other states. The men, who live in San Diego, had legally adopted a year-old boy from Shreveport, Louisiana, in 2006. The adoption was finalized in New York state, where the couple was then residing. In their appeal, spearheaded by the gay rights advocacy group Lambda Legal, the couple said it is important both practically and symbolically that they both be listed as the legal parents. ""Obtaining an amended birth certificate that accurately identifies both parents of an adopted child is vitally important for multiple purposes, including determining the parents' and child's right to make medical decisions for other family members at the necessary moments; determining custody, care, and support of the child in the event of a separation or divorce between the parents,"" the legal brief said. Lawyers for the men also said it is vitally necessary for Social Security and tax purposes, inheritance, insurance, school registration, and obtaining a passport. Adar and Smith tried to have the birth certificate changed in Louisiana. All states have laws creating a right to accurate, amended official birth and identity documents that would be recognized in other states and by the federal government. Darlene Smith, Louisiana's registrar of vital records and statistics, refused their request. She took the position that the term ""adoptive parents"" in the applicable section of state law applies only to married parents, because in Louisiana, only married couples may jointly adopt a child. Louisiana state officials argue they have not refused to recognize the New York adoption decree, and had offered to list one of the parents on the official amended birth certificate. But Adar and Smith insisted both of them should be named. The 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in April that Adar and Smith cannot file a federal civil rights claim under the Constitution's ""full faith and credit"" clause. That refers to Article IV, Section 1, which says states must respect the ""public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state."" The full 16-member court, in an 11-5 ruling, concluded the clause applies only to court actions, not those of state legislators or executive officials, and added that ""there is no legal basis on which to conclude that failure to issue a revised birth certificate denies 'recognition' to the New York adoption decree."" More importantly, the court said states have the power to make their own decisions about issuing birth certificates. ""Adoption is not a fundamental right,"" said the appeals court, citing studies that found marriage provides a more stable environment in which to raise children. ""Louisiana has a legitimate interest in encouraging a stable and nurturing environment for the education and socialization of its adopted children. ... Louisiana may rationally conclude that having parenthood focused on a married couple or single individual -- not on the freely severable relationship of unmarried partners -- furthers the interests of adopted children."" The Supreme Court is likely to decide in late September whether to accept the case for review. If it does, oral arguments would likely be held early next year, and a ruling would come some weeks afterward. A decision by the justices not to intervene would be a final legal defeat for Adar and Smith on the certificate question, but would not affect their continuing custody of the boy. The case is Adar v. Smith, State Registrar (11-46).","Louisiana refuses to list two men as adoptive parents on an amended birth certificate .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- AT&T's wireless network will face major challenges ""in the short term"" unless the carrier is able to begin integrating T-Mobile USA's infrastructure, said AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega. He didn't specify an exact timeframe for when his company's problems could compound but acknowledged that the network's needs must be addressed in less than three years. AT&T announced plans to acquire the American T-Mobile unit from Deutsche Telekom on Sunday in a $39 billion transaction. ""With this deal, we're set"" for both the short and long haul, de la Vega said in a brief interview on Tuesday. Analysts predict that AT&T could see major scrutiny from the regulating bodies that must approve the deal. However, it's unclear how long that process might draw out. ""One of the key drivers (for the deal) was the need for additional spectrum,"" he said on a panel at the CTIA Wireless conference. ""It resolves the pending spectrum challenges that we're facing in major cities."" Wireless spectrum is the airwaves on which cellular signals travel. Without enough spectrum, phone calls can get dropped and internet surfing can slow to a crawl when too many gadgets are trying to connect at the same time. People in the industry talk of an impending ""spectrum crunch."" Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski dedicated a large part of his speech at this week's mobile conference to the topic. ""Unleashing more spectrum must be a national priority,"" he said. ""Every day we are not freeing up spectrum for mobile broadband is a day with real costs to our economy."" The FCC is one regulator, along with the Department of Justice, that will review AT&T's acquisition proposal. Genachowski declined in his speech to comment on the deal. He promoted the idea for broadcasters to auction their spectrum -- something he's championed but hasn't succeeded in implementing. However, Verizon Wireless CTO David Small isn't feeling a spectrum crunch. He said Verizon secured ample airwaves at the FCC auction in 2008, when the company spent an estimated $9.6 billion. ""We bet pretty big with the 700 megahertz spectrum that we bought, and we feel that that gives us a very good path forward for 4G LTE,"" Small said. ""There is not a Verizon Wireless spectrum concern in the short term."" At that same auction, AT&T paid $6.6 billion, analysts said then, in addition to the $2.5 billion spent to acquire Aloha Partners earlier that year. AT&T is positioning the T-Mobile purchase as a proactive move to alleviate overflow in major cities. Poor service quality in cities such as New York and San Francisco has been a criticism lobbed at AT&T over the past several years. De la Vega, the AT&T executive, said he expects Verizon will face issues down the road if it doesn't continue to aggressively buy spectrum. ""You wait and see,"" he said. Verizon's forecast determines that its network will be stable until 2015 before it will need to buy more or free up spectrum from its own holdings, Small said. That's despite iPhone data usage being ""a little bit higher than what we had expected,"" he said. ""We feel we're in pretty good shape for the next three to four years."" Small was also unimpressed with AT&T's pledge to expand the rollout of its faster 4G LTE network to 95% of the U.S. population from 80% if federal regulators approve the T-Mobile merger. ""From my view, that's old news,"" Small said of AT&T's promise. Verizon had set a deadline in 2013 for when its own version of that network technology will match its 3G coverage, which blankets about 97% of Americans. Verizon's 4G LTE began deployment in December, currently covers 59 cities and will add 88 more by the end of the year.","AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega says the network faces short-term problems .

"(CNN) -- The Pakistani president Tuesday said his country provided initial help that ultimately led to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, but he said it had no clue about the terror mastermind's whereabouts and didn't participate in the U.S. raid to kill the top militant. Asif Ali Zardari, writing in a Washington Post op-ed column, said that the raid was not a ""joint operation"" and bin Laden ""was not anywhere we had anticipated he would be."" ""And we in Pakistan take some satisfaction that our early assistance in identifying an al Qaeda courier ultimately led to this day,"" Zardari said, referring to the trusted bin Laden aide whose movements helped the United States find the al Qaeda leader. U.S. politicians and military officials have roundly criticized Pakistan for not being more robust in the fight against al Qaeda, the Taliban and other militants who have a strong presence along the Afghan-Pakistani border. But Zardari defended Pakistan's anti-terror activities, saying there has been ""a decade of cooperation and partnership between the United States"" and his country that ultimately led to bin Laden's death. Zardari said he ""endorses the words"" of and ""appreciates the credit"" from U.S. President Barack Obama about Pakistan's role. In his announcement of bin Laden's death, Obama said it's ""important to note that our counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding."" Zardari said that ""some in the U.S. press have suggested that Pakistan lacked vitality in its pursuit of terrorism, or worse yet, that we were disingenuous and actually protected the terrorists we claimed to be pursuing. Such baseless speculation may make exciting cable news, but it doesn't reflect fact. ""Pakistan had as much reason to despise al Qaeda as any nation. The war on terrorism is as much Pakistan's war as it is America's. And though it may have started with bin Laden, the forces of modernity and moderation remain under serious threat,"" Zardari said. He emphasized that Pakistan ""paid an enormous price for its stand against terrorism,"" noting that the country lost thousands of soldiers, police, and civilians in the battle. He also mentioned his late wife, Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistani politician who was assassinated in 2007. ""Justice against bin Laden was not just political; it was also personal, as the terrorists murdered our greatest leader, the mother of my children. Twice he tried to assassinate my wife. In 1989 he poured $50 million into a no-confidence vote to topple her first government. She said that she was bin Laden's worst nightmare -- a democratically elected, progressive, moderate, pluralistic female leader. She was right, and she paid for it with her life,"" he said. He said the Taliban reacted to bin Laden's death ""by blaming the government of Pakistan and calling for retribution against its leaders, and specifically against me as the nation's president."" But Zardari said Pakistanis won't be ""intimidated."" ""Pakistan has never been and never will be the hotbed of fanaticism that is often described by the media,"" he said.","Zardari defends Pakistan in a Washington Post op-ed .

"(CNN) -- A three-judge federal appeals panel has ruled that Tucson shooting suspect Jared Lee Loughner can refuse anti-psychotic medication. Tuesday's ruling comes days after the court said it would review an appeal by attorneys for the government who argued the alleged gunman should be forced to take anti-psychotic drugs for his behavior. The federal appeals court last week temporarily halted the forced medication. ""Since Loughner has not been convicted of a crime, he is presumptively innocent and is therefore entitled to greater constitutional protections than a convicted inmate,"" court documents said. ""While both interests are significant, we conclude that preserving the dignity and bodily integrity of an individual who has not been convicted of a crime is the stronger interest, especially when the government has demonstrated that it is able to prevent that individual from harming himself or others."" Loughner is being held in a federal mental hospital after an earlier court ruling found him incompetent to stand trial.  The hospital's medical staff began forcing him to take psychotropic medication after it deemed him to be a danger to himself and others. He is charged with killing six people -- including the chief federal judge of Arizona, John Roll -- in a supermarket parking lot in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8.  Among the 13 people wounded was U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, who was shot in the head. On May 25, a judge found Loughner incompetent to stand trial and committed him to federal custody for hospitalization at the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, where the staff will determine whether Loughner will become competent in the foreseeable future and, if so, oversee his mental restoration. CNN's Scott Thompson contributed to this report.","Jared Lee Loughner no longer has to take anti-psychotic medication, a court says .

"(CNN)  -- Martin Kaymer's victory in last year's U.S. PGA Championship has given him the ""belief and motivation"" to add to his major tally at this week's British Open at Royal St George's this week. The 26-year-old German burst to prominence with his victory at Whistling Straits and had a brief spell as the world's top-ranked golfer earlier this year. Kaymer told CNN that his triumph had impacted on him in a ""very positive"" way as he approached each major. ""It gave me a lot of belief and motivation I could do well, especially coming to big events like the British Open,"" he said. Kaymer believes that putting could well prove the key to victory come Sunday on the links course in south-east England. ""You will miss the greens and you will have some long putts with a lot of slopes between you and the hole,"" he told the official tournament website. ""It's very tough to hit them to a foot or two, so that's why I think there will be plenty of tricky putts that you have to save for par,"" he added. Kaymer is a big supporter of the only major outside of the United States, saying it was his ""favorite"" tournament of the year. ""It's a fantastic major and is so different than all the other tournaments and that makes it very special and new. ""You have to be creative and you have to think a lot and mentally it's very tiring. That's what I like about it. It's not normal. You have to play different golf."" Looking at the other contenders for the title, Kaymer made a point of singling out U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy and admitted he watched on in admiration as the Northern Irishman dominated the field at Congressional. ""The way he played made me feel like I need to practice more. I need to hit more balls, need to become a better player because he played that golf course almost in a perfect way."" he said.

"(CNN) -- The death of a University of Oklahoma football player was caused by multiple drugs in his system -- including five different painkillers -- at the time of death nearly two months ago, according to the state's toxicology report released Tuesday. ""It is with much sadness we look back and see that recently Austin had turned to other methods of managing his pain,"" said the parents of Austin Box, 22. They said they hoped others dealing with pain in a similar manner ""will see this tragic accident as a message and think about the consequences."" ""Our greatest regret is that Austin did not feel he could share his pain with those who loved him,"" his parents said. Box was found unconscious and not breathing in an El Reno, Oklahoma, home May 19, according to a 911 tape released by CNN affiliate KWTV. ""He takes pain pills, and he's not responding to me,"" a voice on the tape told a police dispatcher. Box was pronounced dead later that morning at an Oklahoma City Hospital, according to police who told KWTV. According to the autopsy report, Box had five different painkillers in his system -- oxymorphone, morphine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone and oxycodone -- as well as alprazolam, an anti-anxiety drug. The last few years of Box's life were full of injuries that often required surgeries, his parents said. The most recent injury was a ruptured disc in his back in August 2010. Box was able to return to the field after recovery to help his team. He was considered a big part of Oklahoma's late-season resurgence, according to the coaching staff, and was slated to begin his senior year as the Sooners' starting middle linebacker.

"(CNN) -- A blistering heat wave retreated to the south Wednesday, bringing some relief to the Ohio Valley and northeastern United States. The number of states under heat advisories has diminished to 12 -- half the number earlier in the week. Dangerous heat is expected across parts of northern Texas through Thursday evening, according to the National Weather Service. Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington and other areas will experience afternoon heat indices of 105 degrees or more through Thursday. Other states still sweltering under heat advisories include Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Many Tennesseans should expect the heat index to be between 110 and 114 degrees for the rest of the week, according to the National Weather Service. ""I just had to stop once in a while and catch a breath, it was just that tough to breathe,"" said Marion, Illinois, resident Ceasar Maragni, who opted to stay inside Tuesday after a swampy Monday evening trip to the Williamson County Fair. Even the frozen lemonade vendor was lagging with few customers in the nearly 100-degree evening heat, he said. Other areas of the country not under heat advisories touted new record highs Tuesday. Newark, New Jersey, broke its previous record of 98, set in 1966, when it hit 99 degrees. JFK Airport and Islip, New York, did the same, reporting 97 and 93 degrees respectively, beating 1993 records of 94 degrees at JFK and 91 in Islip. In central Oklahoma, temperatures in some places shot past the 100 mark for the 14th consecutive day Tuesday. Highs in much of the state are likely to flirt with triple-digits for almost another week, according to the National Weather Service. High demand for water amid the heat wave and problems with soil shrinking as the ground warms has resulted in burst pipes and low water pressure in Oklahoma City. This prompted officials to issue mandatory water-use restrictions for the first time in at least a decade, according to utilities department spokeswoman Debbie Ragan. More than 200 people have suffered from heat-related emergencies in Tulsa and Oklahoma City since June 17, when the agency issued its first heat alert, said Lara O'Leary, spokeswoman for the Emergency Medical Services Authority of Oklahoma. The heat has been so extreme that a portion of the Cimarron Turnpike in Pawnee County, Oklahoma, buckled on Sunday, creating a 2-foot ramp that sent a motorcyclist flying 150 feet through the air. In addition to the discomfort and potential danger, the heat could wreak havoc on crops, especially corn, said Chad Hart, assistant professor of agricultural economics at Iowa State University. The heat wave comes at a sensitive time for corn, he said. ""That's why markets are watching the heat wave. We're entering a period of time when corn pollinates, and so if you get a heat wave in the early- to mid-part of July across Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, it can have a big impact,"" he said. ""The last time we had a big heat wave and drought was in 1988, and that year we saw corn production fall off by over 30% ... so if we think of where we are today with already-high corn prices, a true drought scenario can push prices to highs we've never seen before."" Temperatures will return to nearly normal summertime levels by Wednesday throughout the Northeast, said Chris Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Weather Service. High pressure over the Plains is keeping the weather pattern stable, allowing heat to build. A cooler, dryer weather system is nibbling at the northern edges of the heat wave, threatening to exchange high temperatures for potentially dangerous thunderstorms, according to forecasters. There's not quite so much relief in store for residents of the lower Midwest and South. ""This has been going on all weekend and will continue into this week,"" Vaccaro said. In Oklahoma City, forecasters are calling for nearly another full week of temperatures near or above 100 degrees, threatening to break a 1936 record for 22 consecutive days of such heat. Nighttime will bring little solace. While record- and near-record daytime highs are being set, many areas are also experiencing record warm lows at night. For instance, the low temperature of 83 recorded early Tuesday in North Little Rock, Arkansas, set a new record for the warmest low in July, Vaccaro said. Warm nights are a problem for people without air conditioning, he said. ""If you're exposed to the outside elements, your body can't cool down at night,"" he said. The heat has already claimed at least one victim, a 51-year-old man in Granite City, Illinois, who died Sunday because of the excessive heat, according to the Madison County coroner. Forecasters say people should limit outdoor activity during the hottest portions of the day, wear lightweight clothing, drink plenty of water and be watchful for signs of heat exhaustion, which include heavy sweating, pale and clammy skin, weak pulse, fainting and vomiting. CNN's Monica O'Connor, Meteorologist Jacqui Jeras, Ed Payne, Karen Smith and Chelsea Bailey contributed to this report.","The National Weather Service has taken down heat advisories in some states .

"Boston (CNN) -- Government prosecutors have released a series of new photographs showing cash, weapons and even a grenade recovered from the Santa Monica, California, apartment where fugitive James ""Whitey"" Bulger and his long-time companion, Catherine Greig, apparently lived for 15 years while he was being hunted by the FBI. The photographs were introduced as evidence Monday during a detention hearing for Greig, whose court-appointed attorney is seeking to have her released on bail. FBI Agent Michael Carazza testified that agents found 30 weapons inside the apartment, some of them hidden behind living room and bathroom walls. The evidence photographs show several handguns, one automatic rifle and a hand grenade the FBI says was recovered after it arrested Bulger in late June at the small apartment only a few blocks from the beach. The government also released a brief security camera video of Greig walking in and out of a local drugstore, picking up a prescription, prosecutors said, that was under an assumed name. Bulger and Greig were known in Santa Monica as Charles and Carol Gasko. One neighbor, 88-year-old Catalina Schlank, told CNN that the couple was always friendly to her. But, she added, they refused to be listed as an emergency contact in the event Schlank became ill, and the only phone number they provided was one that was directed to an answering service. The detention hearing was to determine whether Greig will be granted bail on charges of harboring a fugitive. During the hearing, her attorney, Kevin Reddington, told the judge that his client was a ""kind, gentle person"" who had a ""loving personality."" For his part, Bulger had entered a plea of not guilty to 19 counts of murder. Bulger fled Boston in 1995 after learning from an FBI agent who had recruited him as an informant that he was about to be indicted on a series of racketeering and drug charges. He spent those years, prosecutors said, in several cities before landing in California. Special Agent Carazza told the court Bulger had 15 different aliases during that time.","James ""Whitey"" Bulger was hunted by the FBI for 16 years .

In another, taken some years later, Phillip Garrido accompanies a parole agent who is searching their home as his wife, Nancy Garrido, films the search, mere yards from the outbuildings where Dugard is hidden. The videotapes were released Tuesday by the El Dorado County, California, district attorney's office in response to media inquiries under open-records laws, and ""to highlight the gravity and severity of the mistakes made"" by law enforcement in the 18 years the Garridos held Dugard captive, during which time she gave birth to two children by Phillip Garrido. Dugard and her children do not appear in the videos released Tuesday. Dugard was just 11 years old when she was abducted in 1991 from the street in front of her South Lake Tahoe, California, home by Phillip Garrido, a convicted sex offender who had served 11 years for rape. Despite the fact that as a parolee he was regularly visited by police, he and his wife held Dugard and her daughters in a hidden compound of sheds and tarpaulins until 2009. Last month, a judge sentenced Phillip Garrido, 60, to 431 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping and 12 counts of sexual assault. Nancy Garrido, 55, got 36 years to life in prison for her role in the crimes, including kidnapping and one count of rape by force. The couple had pleaded guilty in late April in El Dorado Superior Court. A statement from Dugard, read by her mother at the sentencing hearing, called the Garridos ""evil"" and described her kidnapping by them as a ""sexual perversion."" In a statement accompanying the release of the videos, the DA's office said it had decided to reveal ""certain details of this horrific case"" at the request of Dugard's family ""in hopes of improving the supervision and detection of sexual predators."" In one of the three videotapes, taken sometime between 1989 and 1993, the Garridos can be heard talking in low tones about how the autofocus and other features of the camera work. Meanwhile, the jostled camera catches fleeting images of children playing in a playground some yards away -- then settles on a small girl playing in the sand as older girls gambol on a tire swing. Then, Phillip Garrido stands against a tree, and begins playing the guitar and singing while the camera pans to either side, pushing his face to the margins and centering on the children in the background. ""You got me real good?"" he asks at one point while barely on camera. ""Yeah,"" she responds, ""I can see you really good."" Another brief and inept video, apparently taken from a car in which the Garridos are sitting, shows a girl getting onto a bicycle and people in a parking lot. The camera zooms in on the legs. Nancy Garrido appears onscreen briefly, affecting a grin. The third clip, taken between 2000 and 2007, was taken by Nancy Garrido during a parole agent's search of their home in Antioch, California. As the agent goes from room to room, Phillip Garrido has little to say to his queries. But Nancy Garrido does, and raises some non sequiturs of her own. ""What does a parole agent do for his parolees?"" she asks at one point. ""Ma'am, you can come to the office and we'll discuss that at an appropriate time,"" the parole agent responds. ""Right now I'm doing a search, and I'd really -- uh, if you'll stay in this front room, then I don't have to place you in restraints."" The agent's face is blurred in the video clip, and a portion where his name is mentioned is edited out. The images of children's faces also are blurred. CNN's Cameron Tankersley contributed to this report.","Videotapes taken by Phillip and Nancy Garrido were released by prosecutors Tuesday .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles County authorities exhumed the remains Wednesday of a woman whose mysterious disappearance and death in Malibu Canyon have been the subject of a family crusade for justice, the coroner's office said. The grave of Mitrice Richardson, who disappeared at age 24 in September 2009, was exhumed so that her family's private pathologist could investigate the remains, said Ed Winter, assistant chief of operations and investigations of the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner. The cause of Richardson's death remains undetermined, Winter said Wednesday. ""We just don't know,"" Winter said about the cause of death. Her remains were scheduled to be reburied in Inglewood (California) Cemetery Park on Wednesday afternoon, he said. The exhumation also took place so that authorities could return to her grave some of her bones that were found after her body was discovered in Malibu Canyon in August 2010, Winter said. The bones, found on two different occasions following the discovery of her body, underwent DNA analysis to confirm that they were Richardson's, Winter said. Last January, after an emotional public appeal, Richardson's mother persuaded Los Angeles County authorities to exhume the remains and involve the FBI crime lab in examining them and Richardson's clothing. The exhumation and the FBI participation marked a victory in Latice Sutton's long struggle to get authorities to investigate her daughter's mysterious disappearance as a murder. Richardson disappeared after she left the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lost Hills/Malibu station, where she had been detained for allegedly being unable to pay $89.51 for food and drink at a Malibu restaurant. At one point in the controversy over her death, Richardson's father, Michael Richard, blamed the Sheriff's Office for releasing his daughter without any assistance even though she had mental health issues and was in a manic state. He accused local authorities of providing special treatment and transportation to celebrities running afoul of the law such as Mel Gibson and Charlie Sheen, but said his daughter didn't receive similar courtesy. Richardson's skeletal and mummified remains were found about eight miles from the sheriff's station, in the Monte Nido section of the Santa Monica Mountains, which bisect Los Angeles, Latice Sutton said. Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca has said Richardson's case showed ""no indication of a homicide,"" but he and the coroner's office agreed to the exhumation as a matter of cooperation with her family. ""We've been working with family ever since her remains were recovered,"" Winter said Wednesday.","Mitrice Richardson's family has fought to have her death investigated as a murder .

"(Ars Technica)  -- Amazon has sold loads of cheap Kindles ever since it decided to introduce a WiFi-only model and drop the price to just $139. Now, the company is taking its low-priced-Kindle initiative a step further by introducing on-screen ads to its lowest-price model, allowing the company to drop the price by another $25. The ad-supported Kindles will begin shipping on May 3. Kindle director Jay Marine revealed the company's plans in an interview with the Associated Press on Monday afternoon. ""It was very important that we didn't interfere with the reading experience,"" Marine told the publication, noting that ads would display across the bottom of the screen and on the Kindle's screen saver, but not while the user was reading a Kindle book. ""We think customers are going to love it."" Loving the new Kindle with Special Offers -- yes, that's the actual product name -- might be somewhat of a stretch for many users. If the ads stay out of Kindle books and remain limited to the navigation screen and screen saver, they will at least be unobtrusive, and users might be OK with that. Ars Technica: DNA unlikely to explode in presence of cellphone radiation . However, the device will still cost $114; the $25 savings may not be enough to convince some cheapskates. (Call us when the ad-supported Kindle costs $50, and we may be more impressed.) So, loving it might be hard, but liking it is a remote possibility. On the upside, Amazon doesn't look like it's replacing the previous ad-free version of the WiFi-only Kindle. According to a new ad on the front page of its website, Amazon offers three options: the Special Offers Kindle for $114, WiFi-only Kindle for $139, and the 3G Kindle for $189. Ars Technica: Adobe connects tablets to Photoshop . The company also said it's introducing an app called AdMash that will allow customers to help choose future (ad-related) screensavers, and that users will be able to specify their screen saver preferences so they only see the images they like the most. These elements combined make the Kindle with Special Offers a little easier to swallow, but we're glad the option is still there to fork over an extra $25 for an advertising-free e-book reader.

"St. Paul, Minnesota (CNN) -- Seventeen-year-old Claire Thomas has found the silver lining in Minnesota's government shutdown: she gets to spend more time with her two mothers on her summer vacation. Toby McAdams and her partner, Wendy Crowell, were both included in the mass layoff that left more than 20,000 state workers jobless. ""It's actually a little bit nice to have my mothers home for a teency bit,"" said the soon-to-be high school senior. ""But if it's (going to last) months, I can't imagine. I mean already my mom is wandering around a little lost, because she wants to work. ... Both of my moms' jobs are so important to them."" McAdams, 43, has worked for the state for 17 years, currently in the office of emergency preparedness, and Crowell, 50, studies invasive species for the Department of Natural Resources. Both their jobs were deemed ""nonessential"" by the state, thus they've been laid off. They'll receive benefits but no pay, and there's no guarantee they will keep their jobs when all is said and done. Coming spending cuts could be significant when or if a new state budget is finally agreed upon.  Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton offered a budget proposal that included a mix of spending cuts and tax increases to offset the state's $5 billion budget gap, but Republicans in control of the legislature have thus far refused to budge on any plan that includes a tax increase. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported this week that 138 legislators are still collecting paychecks during the shutdown, while 62 have declined to accept the checks. iReporter: ""I'm not sure I can wait for my job to come back to me."" That news certainly doesn't make McAdams' and Crowell's layoffs any easier to swallow. ""It's hard. I miss my job, and I miss doing the work that I know is so important for Minnesota,"" McAdams said. The couple worry that, should this continue very long, they'll have to tap into a college savings fund they set up for Claire and her younger brother, Adam. ""I'm counting on our family to have a safety net if something bad happens,"" Claire said, just minutes after a brief discussion with her parents over lunch regarding the varying costs of her top college choices. The family has also had discussions on how to cut back with everyday trips to the grocery store. Claire, who also works part time at a nearby farm, has an affinity for ""fancy"" food, which is organic and chemical-free. Doing the family's shopping will be tougher. ""I would have to compromise my values a little bit ... I would buy cheaper things, buy cheaper milk,"" she said. ""But I work at a farm (so) I can use the surplus there, and it helps that we have a garden."" Aside from the financial effects, McAdams and Crowell worry what a lack of government services -- and thousands of employees --  will do to the state long-term. ""Things are going to get worse, and we aren't going to be able to do anything about it. So it's going to be painful to watch,"" McAdams said. ""Minnesota won't be such a nice place to live after a while."" ""We have legislators. And their job is to work out a budget for us,"" she added. ""I'd like to see them do it.""","Government shutdown results in dual layoffs for St. Paul, Minnesota, family .

"New York (CNN) -- Levi Aron was arraigned in a New York court Thursday on charges of murder and kidnapping in the first degree in the killing of an 8-year-old boy and remanded under suicide watch until a mental evaluation is completed. Aron, 35, showed no emotion as he entered the court handcuffed and did not enter a plea. He said earlier in a statement that he was sorry for the trouble he has caused, said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. Defense attorneys Pierre Bazile and Gerard Marrone told the court that Aron hears voices and requested an exam to determine whether he understands the charges. Aron's next court date is July 28. Kings County District Attorney Charles J. Hynes had said he would ask a grand jury for the ""maximum charges permitted by law"" for ""the vicious and callous murder and dismemberment of eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky."" Police found human remains in Aron's freezer and a trash bin which they believe are those of the boy, who went missing Monday afternoon. Kelly called the case ""heartbreaking."" ""Obviously in this business you see a lot of violence, but there's usually some sort of irrational twisted logic that's given to why a violent event took place,"" Kelly said. ""Here, I mean it's just, it defies all logic and I think that's what's really so, so terribly disturbing about this case. There's absolutely no reason. There's nothing more innocent than an 8-year-old child and to be, you know, killed in this manner it's just ... heartbreaking."" Police said Aron, 35, made statements Wednesday implicating himself in the death of Kletzky. Both are members of the close-knit Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn. Kelly said detectives found the remains in a freezer in Aron's third-floor attic apartment and in a trash bin more than two miles away, wrapped in a black plastic garbage bag inside a suitcase. A cause of death has yet to be determined but police believe Kletzky was suffocated. Kletzky was supposed to meet his parents after walking seven blocks from his summer day camp, but became lost and asked the suspect for directions, Kelly said. Surveillance video showed Aron entering a dentist's office Monday while Kletzky waited for him across the street for seven minutes, Kelly said. Aron claims he took Kletzky to a wedding Monday night in Monsey, New York, and then brought him back, Kelly said. Police said Aron went to the wedding, but have not been able to confirm that Kletzky actually went with him, as no one has said they've seen him. According to Kelly, police showed up at Aron's residence at 2:40 a.m. Wednesday and asked him about Kletzky's whereabouts. The suspect pointed them to the kitchen, where blood was visible on the freezer handle. Inside the refrigerator was a cutting board with three blood-spattered carving knives, Kelly said. Aron, a clerk at a maintenance supply company, did not appear to have known Kletzky, Kelly said. His only known criminal summons was for urinating in public last year. Kelly said that statements made by the suspect indicated that he kidnapped Kletzky and, as a neighborhood search for the boy intensified, he became panicked and killed him. ""We're all in shock,"" said state Assemblyman Dov Hikind of the people in his district. ""What kind of people are out there that are capable of creating these dastardly acts?"" Aron's ex-wife, Debbie Aron of Memphis, Tennessee, said she has been in ""total shock"" since she heard the news. She said her children from an earlier marriage lived with her when she was married to Levi Aron and that he helped take care of them. He also enjoyed karaoke. ""I can't believe it. It's definitely not in his character from ... the person I knew,"" she told CNN affiliate WMC. ""Even as I talked to him not long ago, everything was fine, no indications that anything was wrong."" After Kletzky went missing Monday, residents joined with local and federal authorities in a massive search effort. FBI spokesman Jim Margolin said the FBI assisted in interviewing witnesses and deployed the FBI's Crimes Against Children squad in the case. CNN's Jesse Solomon contributed to this report.","Levi Aron appeared in a New York court to be formally charged .

"(CNN) -- ""Homefront"" tries to craft an expansive, historical ""What if?"" scenario. But the new game ends up delivering ""Oh ... not again!"" game play. The first-person shooter from Kaos Studios and THQ expands on current tensions with North Korea, but delves into a future where North and South Korea unify and ultimately occupy the United States in 2027. You play as Robert Jacobs, a former pilot who is thrown in with a band of rebels intent on fighting to regain control of America. The depiction of a brutalized and beaten-down Colorado city is very well done. In the game, the Korean forces have erected a wall around the city and the remaining homes and businesses look as if they have been under siege for quite some time. It is hard to find an oasis in the bleak surroundings and the scene accurately portrays a sense of doom that plagues a nation after a wartime loss. But The Resistance remembers the old glory of the USA and wants to do what it can to bring it back. Game play is straightforward, first-person shooter action -- with a massive emphasis on shooting. There is very little stealth or strategy involved as the game progresses along a pretty strict linear path -- giving players few choices as they move from one virtual shooting gallery to the next. Weapons are the  automatic rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols and grenades that are typical for the genre. Ammo is scarce early in the game but seems to become easier to find as the story moves forward. The characters who initially rescue Jacobs and assist him throughout the missions border on stereotypical, with very little personality other than what's needed to move the game from point A to point B. There is the strong but calm leader, who ends up getting killed during a cut scene. There is the overbearing foul-mouth who just wants to attack at nearly every chance. There is a female nonplayer character who is good at stealth and is really the only character who exhibits any emotion other than anger. And there is a character of Korean descent that is great at fixing the tech, but is the target of racial hatred. None of the characters really connect on any level. Even when they die, it doesn't really evoke any empathy from the player and just feels like another video-game casualty. The game is frequented by buggy movement and areas that load awkwardly. Often, a scene will be completed and an opening will appear to move on, but instead of walking through, a nonplayer character will block your way for a minute or so before moving on. Other characters will also appear to be having some sort of fit when standing around as they shake violently before progressing. It was really hard to feel immersed in the game play. While there were objectives to be met, there was no real sense of accomplishment in getting them done. In fact, there was one scene where I decided to see what would happen if I made Jacobs just stand off to the side. A nonplayer character completed the mission without my help. The story and the idea for an alternative future with a unified Korea as a world power had great potential. Trying to retake American soil against overwhelming odds is rooted within our national DNA and would have made a great tale for an FPS/strategy-style game. In one scene, the Resistance fighters crest a hill overlooking the town they are attempting to flee, only to see it in flames from Korean rockets and explosives. Instead of exploring possible revenge or expressing remorse, the characters quickly gloss over it and head to the next shooting ground. It was that sort of repetition that brought the game down. Individually, the pieces felt like they were there -- good action, nice story -- but without any sense of accomplishment or involvement, ""Homefront"" stagnated, hampered by slow transitions and spotty animation. It also didn't help that the single-player campaign was over quickly (six hours for me). ""Homefront"" also stirred up controversy with its choice of a real world opponent. The game has been banned in South Korea and censored in Japan, removing all references to North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong Il. On the positive side, the multiplayer action was better than the campaign because it took the elements that worked and added objectives that felt real when accomplished. Ground-control mode and ""team deathmatch"" mode pit one side against the other, but there are bonuses and points that let you rack up new weapons and ablatives as the fighting is still ongoing. Kill streaks can also gain players additional abilities, like increased weapon damage. There's a twist, though. The longer your kill streak, the more likely you are to be targeted by enemy forces. Players become ""Instigators"" for completing mission elements and the opposite side can then use Hunters to eliminate you. The more missions you complete, the more Hunters can be assigned to find you and kill you. It makes the game feel alive in multiplayer action and it really does take teamwork to win. It is just too bad those qualities couldn't transfer over to the single player. ""Homefront"" is available on PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It is rated M for Mature due to strong language, violence, and blood. This review was done on a retail copy for the Xbox 360.","""Homefront"" is a first-person shooter from Kaos Studios and THQ .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A company that Chinese authorities say is controlled by dissident artist Ai Weiwei challenged tax evasion allegations Thursday. An attorney; Ai's wife, Lu Qing; and an accountant were to represent the design firm at the hearing. Pu Zhiqiang, a famous human rights lawyer in China, told CNN that the Beijing tax bureau declined to have an open hearing and provided no reason. Ai said he disagreed with plans to have a closed hearing. ""If we wish the modern society to function effectively, cases like this should be conducted openly with transparency and public witness,"" Ai said. ""Otherwise a lot of problems would emerge."" Pu said that if the evidence is valid, he will advise Ai's company, which includes a studio, to pay the back taxes of 5 million RMB (US $770,000) and the punishment fee of 7 million RMB (US $1 million), which is in accordance with Chinese regulations. If he does not find the evidence valid, however, Pu said that the company will appeal. Ai, considered China's most famous artist, was originally detained in April on grounds of tax evasion. However, his family and human rights advocates believe that the real reason for his imprisonment is his outspoken criticism of the Chinese state. After three months in jail, Ai was released on bail in June, possibly for medical concerns. Most famous for designing the Bird's Nest stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Ai later called for a boycott of the games because he said China was using them as propaganda. Ai also has accused the Chinese government of trying to silence dissidents. Also Thursday, Ai confirmed he had received an invitation from the Berlin University of the Arts to accept a professorship there. ""I won't be allowed to leave the country for at least a year so I'll have to  wait until I'm free to have a clear plan about my future and my work,"" he said. The president of the university, Martin Rennert, said the institution will welcome Ai whenever he can make it.

"Santa Ana, California -- Federal authorities arrested 26 members or associates of the Mexican Mafia gang in southern California Wednesday on charges involving drug trafficking, racketeering and murder, officials said. A total of 57 defendants were charged, including 25 already incarcerated on unrelated offenses, authorities said. The remaining six are fugitives, authorities said. The 57 are charged in five indictments accusing them of being members or associates of the Mexican Mafia and the affiliated Forming Kaos street gang, both of which operate in Orange County, California, officials said. Two of the five indictments allege racketeering. One names 28 alleged members of the Mexican Mafia, including its Orange County leader Peter Ojeda, who is currently serving a federal prison sentence for an unrelated 2006 conviction, authorities said. The other racketeering indictment identifies 17 alleged members of the Forming Kaos street gang in Costa Mesa, California, which has ties to the Mexican Mafia, officials said. The remaining three indictments charge 13 of the defendants with trafficking of heroine, methamphetamine and cocaine and with firearms offenses, authorities said. The Orange County District Attorney's Office also filed various charges in connection with the alleged murder and assault conspiracies, authorities said. More than 500 federal and local law enforcement officers carried out Wednesday's arrest and search warrants, culminating an investigation that lasted years, authorities said. The Mexican Mafia is a powerful and violent prison gang that controls drug distribution and other illegal activities within the California penal system and on the streets of southern California by organizing Hispanic street gang members to establish a larger network for the Mexican Mafia's illegal activities, authorities claimed in a statement . ""If a gang does not accede to the Mexican Mafia, the Mexican Mafia will assault or kill the gang's members who are not in custody, as well as those members who are incarcerated within the California penal system,"" authorities said in a statement. Ojeda, who served as the Orange County leader of the Mexican Mafia for decades, is accused of ordering Hispanic gangs to pay a ""tax"" or ""tribute,"" and in exchange, they were permitted to exert influence over their neighborhoods and seek Mexican Mafia protection, authorities said. For those gangs not paying the tax, Ojeda allegedly ordered them to be physically disciplined under ""green lights"" or targeted them for death by putting them on a ""Hard Candy"" list, authorities said. ""No member of the Mexican Mafia, and no gang member affiliated with the Mexican Mafia, is beyond the reach of the law,"" U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr., said in a statement.

"(Mashable) -- Ford Motor Company Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. is confident that the auto industry is on its way to eliminating CO2 emissions. He's less confident, however, that the world is prepared to adequately deal with an even larger problem: the global gridlock created by a population set to grow to 9 billion people by 2044. The growth, said Ford in a talk at the TED conference in Long Beach, CA on Wednesday, will see the number of vehicles on the road go from 800 million today to 2-3 billion by 2050. The global gridlock crisis, as Ford describes it, will ""stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and healthcare ... [and] our quality of life will be significantly compromised."" Mashable: TED videos: web's best brainfood translated into 40+ languages . Citing the fact that the average American spends one week per year in traffic, and that the average resident in Beijing spends 5 hours per day commuting, Ford thinks the answer to the crisis is not to build more roads, but to build a smarter transportation system that makes use of real-time data and connected cars. Ford envisions a future where all cars are connected and as he puts it, ""talk to each other,"" such that you already have a parking spot at your destination when you leave your house, be automatically re-routed to avoid traffic based on data being sent in real-time by the cars in front of you, and find a cab via your smartphone. In theory, this data would also let you live a more efficient life, enabling you to leave your home such that you'll get to your destination precisely on time. Ford thinks such a future ""will be ready for prime time really soon,"" noting that tests of such systems are already under way around the world. Of course, Ford's company has been an early mover in the connected car space, with Ford SYNC technology now on board 3 million vehicles. Ultimately though, he sees solving the global gridlock crisis as a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs of all sizes, that can both be profitable and as he puts it, ""preserve the freedom to move effortlessly around the world"" that has been responsible for so much economic growth in the century since his great grandfather created the Ford Motor Company. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Australian spin legend Shane Warne has retired from all forms of cricket after playing his final match for Indian Premier League side (IPL) Rajasthan Royals. The 41-year-old, one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, ended his career on a high note, captaining the Rajasthan Royals to a 10-wicket win over the Mumbai Indians, taking one wicket for 30 runs in the process. ""It's been a privilege and a pleasure to captain the Royals,"" Warne said after the match. ""Hopefully, I've helped Indian cricket."" Warne fined $50K ahead of retirement . The colorful Warne has been popular with his teammates and supporters alike during this IPL campaign despite struggling for form and being involved in some off-field controversies.

Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar paid tribute to Warne, telling reporters: ""He is a true champion, a wonderful friend. I have not been privileged to play with him in the same team, but it's been a real treat to play against him."" Warne retired from international cricket in 2007 after becoming the first player in history to take 700 wickets. The leg-spinner always proved as controversial off the field as he was brilliant on it, surviving drug and betting scandals, as well as a much-publicized private life, during his career. His retirement is expected to include more TV commentating, charity work and coaching. ""I'm going to be 42 this year, I'm in a great place in life, both personally and from the business point of view, I just want to thank everyone who supported me,""  Warne told reporters.","Shane Warne has retired from all forms of cricket after playing his final match .

"(CNN) -- Cricket legend Shane Warne will end his playing career as planned on Friday, but the former Australia bowler has been fined $50,000 over a row with an Indian official. The Rajasthan Cricket Association had called for the 41-year-old to be banned after he criticized its secretary Sanjay Dixit following a defeat by the region's Royals team in the Indian Premier League competition. Warne, who is captain and coach of the Royals, had been unhappy about a switch of playing pitches in Jaipur during the 20-over tournament. The Board of Control for Cricket in India, of which Dixit is a finance committee member, said that Warne had made a ""serious"" breach of the rules of his IPL contract. However, its disciplinary committee said it had taken into account that Warne, the second-highest wicket-taker in Test history, had apologized to Dixit for his comments. ""The commission is conscious of the duty of all parties involved in the Indian Premier League, to uphold the image and reputation of the game of cricket, the BCCI and the League at all relevant times,"" it said in a statement on the BCCI website after Wednesday's hearing.

It regards the public criticism of Mr. Dixit as being a serious breach by Mr. Warne of his IPL playing contract. ""However, at the same time, the commission also recognizes that Mr. Warne has apologized to Mr. Dixit, and that the incident occurred just after the match. In addition, the commission is cognizant of the contribution to the game of cricket in general, and to the Indian Premier League, which has been made by Mr. Warne."" The BCCI warned that similar future transgressions by Warne or any other player would result in a higher fine, a suspension and/or a deduction in points for their team. Warne retired from international cricket in early 2007, having taken 708 wickets in the five-day format. He joined Rajasthan in 2008, leading the Royals to the IPL title in the tournament's inaugural season, but the leg-spinner was unable to take his team to this year's playoffs. Warne's final game will be away to Mumbai Indians on Friday, with the Royals having lost four in a row. The franchise's chief marketing officer Raghu Iyer said earlier this month that it hoped Warne would retain his association with it and help develop young talent.","Shane Warne fined $50,000 by Indian cricket's ruling body after criticizing official .

"(CNN)  -- Greetings, everyone! It's a great day for baseball. We've got a great battle for you today between two of the heaviest hitters in the baseball video game universe: ""MLB 11 The Show"" (Sony) and ""MLB2K11"" (2KSports). Both of these popular annual titles have retooled their lineups with some new additions this season. So in honor or baseball's opening day Thursday, we match them up, feature by feature, in a nine-inning smackdown. Here we go: . 1st inning -- Pitching: . Both titles use buttons to select the type of pitch and the right analog stick for the delivery. ""MLB 11 The Show"" is a simple pull-back, push-forward motion with the analog stick for the velocity and direction of the pitch. The more you use a pitch, the better it becomes. A sliding bar indicates the best time to go from back to forward on the stick for optimum accuracy. ""MLB2K11"" uses the left stick for direction and right stick for a series of movements that correspond to the type of pitch you select. For example, a cut fastball might require a move to the left followed by a sweeping motion down. Your success is based on how well you time the power of the pitch and how accurate you are with your analog movements. For ease of playability and not feeling like I have to contort every pitch, ""MLB11 The Show"" scores first here. 2nd inning -- Hitting: . Analog hitting is something both games do, but again, there is a difference in the execution. ""MLB2K11"" uses the left stick to indicate the direction you want to try to hit the ball and the right stick to make contact. A simple swing is a push forward and a power swing is pull back, then push forward. Bunting is done with the square button. Analog hitting on ""MLB 11 The Show"" is all done with the right stick. You can decide if you want a normal swing or power swing by using the circle or square button, respectively. Pull back on the stick to have the player stride and then push forward to swing. Bunting is just a push forward motion. Both are easy enough to use, although I cannot figure out if there is a timing to striding that helps hitting with ""MLB 11 The Show."" However, check swings are a bit easier with the stride, so I'm giving one run each to both games. 3rd inning -- Fielding: . Fielding in the games is identical. Move the left stick to get your player in position and use the correct buttons (or move the right stick if you are doing analog controls) to throw to the proper base. While fly balls in each game use a circle shadow on the field to indicate where the ball is traveling, ""MLB2K11"" changes things up a bit by utilizing a second circle inside the shadow to more precisely tell you where the ball is coming down. That second circle changes in size depending on the fielding rating of the player trying to make the catch. The better the fielder, the smaller the circle. For that, ""MLB2K11"" gets a run. 4th inning -- Players: . Each game is associated with the Major League Baseball Players Association, so almost all of the majors' current players are in the game, and their likenesses are recreated in digital format. The rosters are updated online, but when I tried to get the latest Baltimore Orioles roster, ""MLB 11 The Show"" didn't include offseason acquisition Vladimir Guerrero in the lineup while ""MLB2K11"" did. I did find Vlad in the free agent pool, however. Both games try to recreate a realistic look and feeling with their digital players. ""MLB 11 The Show"" seemed to do a better job at portraying facial features and reactions without being repetitive. ""MLB2K11"" had a couple instances where players would have sunglasses on while walking up to the batter's box, then suddenly lose them when they stepped in. Also, ""MLB2K11"" would sometimes repeat the same player motions over and over after every pitch. Movement in the field felt more natural with ""MLB 11 The Show"" with fluid action and no noticeable hiccups. ""MLB2K11"" had more than a few glitches when transitioning from fielding to throwing, but nothing that took away from actual game play. ""MLB2K11"" gets a run for the roster update out of the box, while ""MLB 11 The Show"" gets 2 for a better look for the players and smoother animation. 5th inning -- Stadiums: . Both games do a great job rendering all 30 major league parks with all the identifying quirks and traits that make each different. And both also have generic-looking minor league ballparks. Since there is no real difference between the two games here, I awarded no runs this inning. 6th inning -- Living the dream: . Each game has a mode that allows you to create a player and take them from AA rookie to the Hall of Fame. ""MLB2K11"" My Player mode provides a mentor that tells you what you need to work on in the minors to get your call-up to the bigs. Skill points can be earned during each at-bat, fielding chance or running opportunity. Increase your skills enough, and you earn a promotion to AAA or the big leagues. ""MLB 11 The Show"" also lets you earn skill points and advance your way through your organization but offers more options when setting up your player. You can figure out what type of player you want to be (contact hitter, power swinger, speedster, etc.). Players also receive evaluations and training to make them better and get them ready for the majors. I played as a 2nd baseman and an outfielder in both. The infield experience was similar, but in the outfield, the camera angle on ""MLB2K11"" sometimes made it difficult to tell where I needed to go to catch the ball. It got to be really frustrating at times. So ""MLB 11 The Show"" scores a run this inning. 7th inning -- Real life: . Baseball is a game driven by statistics, and virtual baseball is no different. ""MLB 11 The Show"" has developed a weather database that attempts to accurately reflect the real weather expected at each MLB stadium. That weather also affects what happens on the field and each player rating. ""MLB2K11"" tries to bring the real game into your virtual game by adjusting player skills as the season progresses. If a player in the real world gets on a hot streak, he will experience a hot streak in the game. Likewise, if he is not playing well, expect his performance to lag in the virtual world. So thanks to those in-season adjustments, ""MLB2K11"" gets the run here. 8th inning -- What's new? ""MLB2K11"" has some improved camera angles, a new revamped fielding system and upgraded player models (although they still could use some work). The interface is better than last year, but still glitchy at times. It sometimes missed easy plays or threw to the wrong base. ""MLB 11 The Show"" offers a new co-op mode that allows for a variety of options when you're playing others online. The game also supports the Sony Move controller and offers a Challenge of the Week, where gamers can earn points toward prizes. And it offers 3-D functionality on the PlayStation 3, if you want to see bats and balls flying at you. Each game earns a run this inning because these new enhancements add value to both. 9th inning -- Bonus items: . ""MLB 11 The Show"" has a limited edition DualShock3 wireless controller that looks sort of like a baseball -- it's white and has baseball seams where the left and right buttons are located. But it's only worthy if you have a PlayStation 3. ""MLB2K11"" is once again offering $1 million to anyone who can pitch (and record) a perfect game using specific criteria. Last year, an Alabama man won the prize using a spring training roster and game. This year, the contest does not actually start until opening day, so the feat may be harder to accomplish. Let's award one run for the awesome DualShock3 controller and one run for the potential of winning a million dollars. And the winner is ...? Final score: ""MLB 11 The Show"" 6, ""MLB2K11"" 5. Both games reach for as much realism as they can. But overall, smoother animation and player renderings make ""MLB 11 The Show"" a better choice in achieving the feeling of immersion in the game. There seems to be more variation in movements and reactions with ""The Show,"" which appears cleaner that ""MLB2K11."" That said, the in-season adjustments in ""MLB2K11"" are an interesting real-life addition to your season. Bottom line: Today's contest was a close call, but either game would be a winner in your collection. Both games were reviewed on the PlayStation 3 using the DualShock 3 controller. ""MLB2K11"" is available on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, PlayStation 2, PSP, Nintendo DS and PC. ""MLB 11 The Show"" is available on the PS3, PS2 and PSP. Both are rated E for Everyone and available now.","We pit ""MLB 11 The Show"" against ""MLB2K11"" in a nine-inning contest .
Both games do a great job rendering realistic major league players and parks .
Each game allows you to create a fictional player and take them from AA to the Hall of Fame .
It was close, but one of the games emerged as our favorite ."
"(CNN)  -- Spaniard Igor Anton claimed the most prestigious win of his cycling career as he took the 14th stage of the Giro d'Italia Saturday which finished on the feared Monte Zoncolan climb. He finished 33 seconds clear of his compatriot Alberto Contador, who increased his advantage in the overall classification after distancing Italy's Vincenzo Nibali in the closing stages. Contador leads Liquigas star Nibali by three minutes 20 seconds with Euskatel's Anton rewarded for his bold ride by moving into third place, just a second behind. The stage from Lienz in Austria had originally been scheduled for 210km but was shortened on Friday when race organizers bowed to pressure from the teams to remove Monte Crostis, with its steep and narrow 15km descent, from the route. It was further reduced while racing was in progress to bypass a fans' protest on the revised route. It left the main action for the winding and narrow Zoncolan, with Saxo Bank's Contador easily covering any threats to his pink jersey. But Anton, who started the day seventh on overall classification, took advantage to ride clear for his first grand tour win since crashing out while leading the Tour of Spain last year. Nibali, who went on to claim victory in Spain for his first win in a major tour, bravely battled to stay with the all-conquering Contador, but in the closing kilometre lost valuable time.","Igor Anton of Spain wins prestigious 14th stage of the Giro d'Italia .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday his office is looking into requests by lawmakers to investigate News Corp., the multinational media conglomerate run by Rupert Murdoch. News Corp. is embroiled in a phone hacking scandal in the United Kingdom that forced one of its top executives, Rebekah Brooks, to resign Friday. Now, U.S. legislators say they want to know if the company engaged in that illegal activity in the United States. ""There have been serious allegations raised in that regard in Great Britain, there is an ongoing investigation,"" Holder told reporters in Sydney, Australia. ""There have been members of Congress in the United States who have asked us to investigate those same allegations. And we are progressing in the regard using the appropriate federal agencies in the United Sates. "" The FBI has launched an investigation into News Corp. after a report that the company's employees or associates may have attempted to hack into phone conversations and voice mail boxes of September 11 survivors, victims and their families, a federal law enforcement source told CNN Thursday. ""We are aware of the allegations and are looking into them,"" said the source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the investigation. ""We'll be looking at anyone acting for or on behalf of News Corp., from the top down to janitors,"" to gather information and determine whether any laws may have been broken. Because the investigation just began, it's too early to say when the first interviews will be conducted, the source said, adding the probe is a ""high priority."" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, earlier this week asked FBI Director Robert Mueller to investigate the possibility that journalists working for Murdoch may have tapped into the phones of 9/11 victims and relatives. News Corp. said Thursday it had no comment on the FBI investigation or the possibility of congressional hearings. Meanwhile, News Corp. boss Rupert Murdoch said in an interview Thursday with the Wall Street Journal newspaper -- one of News Corp.'s own publications -- that he felt the company had handled the crisis ""extremely well in every way possible."" He told the newspaper he had decided to appear before British politicians next Tuesday, after initially declining to attend the hearing, because he wanted to address ""some of the things that have been said in Parliament, some of which are total lies. We think it's important to absolutely establish our integrity in the eyes of the public... I felt it's best just to be as transparent as possible."" Murdoch told the Journal that News Corp. would establish its own independent committee, to be led by a ""distinguished non-employee,"" ""to investigate every charge of improper conduct"" and to draw up a ""protocol for behavior"" for the company's new reporters. Those new reporters won't be working for Brooks. The chief executive of News International, the subsidiary that runs News Corp.'s British print media, resigned Friday in the wake of the scandal. Brooks, who was editor of News of the World at the time of some of the most serious allegations against the newspaper, has been under pressure to step down since the allegations began. In a statement released through News International, she said: ""As chief executive of the company, I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt and I want to reiterate how sorry I am for what we now know to have taken place... While it has been a subject of discussion, this time my resignation has been accepted."" Concerns over the hacking of phones belonging to 9/11 victims and relatives appear to be traceable to a story published Wednesday by the Mirror, a British tabloid that includes a section it describes as ""gossip gone toxic."" The newspaper cited ""a source"" who referred to a former police officer who now works as a private investigator. ""The investigator is used by a lot of journalists in America and he recently told me that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims' private phone data,"" the source reportedly told the newspaper. The source told the Mirror the request came from News of the World, the newspaper at the center of the phone-hacking scandal in Britain. ""He said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their relatives,"" the newspaper said. ""His presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the relevant voice mails, just like has been shown they have done in the UK. The PI said he had to turn the job down. He knew how insensitive such research would be, and how bad it would look. ""The investigator said the journalists seemed particularly interested in getting the phone records belonging to the British victims of the attacks."" Relatives of the victims of the terrorist attacks expressed outrage over the possibility they may have been hacking victims. What they went through is ""heartfelt stuff, and it shouldn't be out there for all to see unless the family approves,"" said Jim Riches, a retired New York Fire Department deputy chief who lost a son in the attacks. ""Until we get some accountability, they're just going to keep doing it,"" Riches said. ""It's completely unethical, unprofessional and basically criminal."" Sally Regenhard, who also lost a son in the attacks, called it ""very horrifying that privacy and personal security could be violated in such an egregious manner."" ""I would hold these people accountable and responsible,"" she told CNN Thursday. ""Someone has to defend the dead."" Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey said the September 11 families have ""suffered enough"" and deserve answers. Murdoch has one prominent U.S. politician, who was praised for his leadership following the 9/11 attacks, coming to his defense, saying Murdoch may have been unaware of what was going on. ""Give people the presumption of innocence,"" former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani told CNN's Candy Crowley in New Hampshire on Thursday. ""I think that just how high up it goes is a big question and one we shouldn't be jumping to conclusions about."" Murdoch and Giuliani are longtime friends. Also, a law and lobbying firm in which Giuliani is partner received $100,000 in lobbying fees from News Corp. in 2005, according to congressional disclosure filings. News of the World, a 168-year-old British newspaper owned by Murdoch, folded over the weekend in the wake of accusations that its reporters illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims, politicians and celebrities. Police in the United Kingdom have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking. There also were allegations that reporters may have bribed law enforcement officers. On Wednesday, several senators sent letters to Holder, asking him to look into concerns that News Corp. violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The law, enacted in 1977, makes it illegal for a U.S. person or company to pay foreign officials to obtain or retain business. Potential liability flows from journalists at News of the World to its parent, News International, and to its parent, News Corp., which is a publicly held company in the United States, and runs Fox News. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Carol Cratty and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","Attorney General Eric Holder says federal agencies are looking into News Corp.

"(CNN) -- West Indies captain Darren Sammy took five wickets as his side wrapped up a 40-run victory over Pakistan in the opening Test match in Guyana. Pakistan resumed day four on 80-3 seeking 219 to win but slumped to 178 all out just after lunch with Sammy and Ravi Rampaul chief architects of their downfall. It means the hosts now take an unassailable 1-0 lead in the two Test series, with the next match starting in St Kitts on Friday. ""This is what West Indies cricket is all about,"" Sammy told the official West Indies Cricket Board web site. ""We're happy. We worked really hard for this win. It was really great the way we were able to deliver on the plans we set out on how we would attack the Pakistanis. ""It's a good feeling. This is about West Indies cricket, we as a team needed this performance, it was total team effort and it was good to come out with a win. ""Lately things haven't been going well but I still have the belief and the rest of the team also have belief. It is still only one victory though and we still have to continue working hard and improving."" Rampaul was the first to strike when he dismissed Asad Shafiq for 42 but Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Akmal steadied the ship, putting on a partnership of 52. Their resistance was broken by Sammy as he trapped Misbah LBW, one of a record 20 given in the match. Sammy removed debutant Mohammad Salman two balls later, again LBW, before Rampaul had Abdur Rehman caught in the slips shortly after lunch. Captain Sammy polished off the tail with three quick wickets, dismissing Akmal for 47 and Umar Gul for one before he bowled Saeed Ajmal to seal victory.","West Indies beat Pakistan by 40 runs in Guyana to seal victory in the first Test .

"(CNN) -- Alberto Contador wrapped up his second Giro d'Italia victory -- and sixth grand tour success -- after the 21st and final stage time-trial in Milan, won by Briton David Millar. Millar completed the 26km stage in 30 minutes and 13 seconds, with Contador taking third place, 36 seconds behind. That meant the 28-year-old Spaniard finished a comfortable six minutes and 10 seconds clear of Italian Michele Scarponi in the overall classification with another Italian, Tour of Spain champion Vincenzo Nibali, back in third place a further 46 seconds behind. Team Leopard rider Weylandt dies in Giro d'Italia crash . Saxo Bank rider Contador, who also has three Tour de France titles and one Tour of Spain success to his name, proved the dominant rider in the race after taking the leader's pink jersey on the ninth stage to Mount Etna. He will now seek to become the first rider since Marco Pantani in 1998 to win the Giro and Tour de France in the same year. Contador won the Tour in 2007, 2009 and last year and was only prevented from racing in 2008 because his then team, Astana, were denied a start place by organizers due to doping infringements. However, a question mark still hangs over last year's Tour victory after Contador tested positive for a tiny amount of the banned muscle-building substance clenbuterol during last July's race. The Spanish Cycling Federation (RFEC) acquitted Contador of any wrong-doing, rescinding an initial decision to give him a one-year ban after accepting the rider's claim that he had unknowingly eaten drug-contaminated meat and was therefore not negligent. But the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and cycling's governing body (UCI) have appealed against the RFEC decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The case concerning Contador was due to be heard by CAS from June 6-8 in order to have the decision before the start of this year's Tour de France on July 2 -- but CAS announced last week they had postponed the hearing to allow further preparation by all parties.","Alberto Contador clinches his second Giro d'Italia victory on Sunday .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- The final results from Ukraine's presidential election on Wednesday showed former Prime Minister Victor Yanukovich winning a close race, but an official declaration of a victor was still to come. Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has refused to concede defeat and plans to demand a recount in some districts, officials from her party, Bloc Tymoshenko, said Tuesday. The tally from the Central Election Commission from Sunday's runoff showed Yanukovich holding 48.95 percent of the vote, and Tymoshenko claiming 45.47 percent. Nearly seven in 10 registered voters showed up at the polls. Yanukovich's supporters rallied outside the commission Tuesday and vowed not to leave until their candidate was named the winner, Ukrainian news agencies and state media reported. In an exclusive interview with CNN on Tuesday, Yanukovich called on Tymoshenko to accept defeat and remember the pro-Western Orange Revolution that swept her to power. ""This country has been democratic for five years, and that's been proven again by this election,"" he said. ""Yulia Tymoshenko is betraying the principles of her Orange Revolution"" by failing to acknowledge defeat. A Yanukovich win would put the finishing touches on a remarkable comeback for the former prime minister five years after he was ousted in a populist uprising. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich by telephone Tuesday, the Kremlin said. ""Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich on the completion of the election campaign, which was highly rated by international observers, and the success achieved at the presidential election,"" a Kremlin statement news statement said. Appearing on television after the polls closed Sunday night, Yanukovich said his opponent should begin preparations to step down. But officials from Tymoshenko's party said Tuesday that she has evidence of election fraud and intends to demand a recount in some districts. The two politicians have fought a bitter battle. Yanukovich has strong links to Russia, and a checkered election history. In 2004, he was declared the winner of the presidential election before the ballot's legitimacy was questioned and he was accused of stealing the race. ""The country remembers times when there were presidents announced, they received congratulations, and then things changed,"" Tymoshenko said Sunday, referring to the 2004 race. A pro-Western uprising, known as the Orange Revolution, followed. Yanukovich's win was annulled, and current President Victor Yushchenko won the re-vote. Yushchenko ran for a second term this year, but, blamed for Ukraine's faltering economy, he did not make the runoff. This year's elections, by contrast to those in 2004, got a clean bill of health from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which sent observers. The OSCE hailed the process as ""professional, transparent and honest,"" saying it should ""serve as a solid foundation for a peaceful transition of power.""","Vote count shows Yanukovich won Ukraine's presidential election .

"(CNN) -- ""I will say, this moment is one that I will never, ever forget,"" said Jason Glisson, recalling a 2008 trip to La Milpa, Belize. ""I was the first person inside a very, very old manmade chamber. It was an incredible feeling. Then I turned on my headlamp and saw three huge spiders."" The opening to a possible future ""Indiana Jones"" movie? Close. Glisson was describing his discovery of an ancient tomb -- including very well-preserved bones found therein -- as part of his study of archaeology, a passion that began for him when he saw the Indiana Jones movies as a child. ""Obsessed is more like it,"" he said, describing his interest in the movies, the first of which, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" was released 30 years ago this summer. ""I could probably recite a large majority of the movies."" Even though he's a fictional character, it's fairly safe to say that Indiana Jones is the most famous archaeologist in the world. ""As a teacher, I would ask my students, 'How many of you were influenced by Indiana Jones films?'"" said Fred Hiebert, an archaeology fellow with National Geographic. ""Everyone in the class would raise their hands."" Hiebert is the co-curator of ""Indiana Jones and the Adventure of Archaeology,"" an exhibition that makes its worldwide debut at the Montreal Science Centre from April 28 through September 19 and then moves on to other international locations. His enthusiasm for Indy, and the exhibition, is infectious. The exhibition ""has an incredible array of movie props from the films. It's got a lot of the designs and paintings and artwork behind the making of these films,"" he said. ""And, we not only have almost 100 incredible treasures from around the world, but we also have the archaeologist's drawings and techniques they use to investigate the past. You get to see what was in the minds of the filmmakers, and the archaeologists."" Aside from the ""Indy"" versions of the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail, there is a lot in the exhibit for hardcore fans of archaeology as well. ""We have a clay tablet with a map of a Mesopotamian city, one of the world's oldest maps,"" Hiebert said. ""We have a fragment of a pot made 6,000 years ago, with the oldest representation of wine. We have a whole series of gorgeous prescribed pots from South America, and the first video of a scholar reading a scene from a stela, in a language no one has spoken for hundreds of years."" Hiebert said he hopes that with this exhibition, ""People will enter the door as Indiana Jones and they will exit very inspired about archaeology. We want to inspire as many people as possible about science."" Indy has certainly inspired a lot of people in the last few decades, judging from the iReporters, like Glisson, who shared their stories of adventure. iReport: Watch video of Glisson's excavation . ""Thirty years ago I sat in a darkened theater, my eyes glued to the big screen, and was swept away into a world of wonder as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' unfolded in front of me,"" said Tim Preston of Petaluma, California. ""Like many of my generation, I dreamed of donning a fedora, picking up a bullwhip and setting off to confront the unknown."" Things didn't quite work out like that for Preston, but 10 years ago, he took a chance and flew to Belize to join an excavation with the Maya Research Program. ""One summer turned into another, followed soon thereafter by a graduate degree in archaeology and finally a job doing what I love the most: excavating Maya ruins deep in the jungles of Belize."" Preston finds his occupation quite fulfilling: ""While I have never had to evade a cunningly constructed death trap or hold off a sword-wielding fanatic with my trusty bullwhip, I feel that I am living out the dream that I had as a young man."" iReport: See photos of Preston's archaeological adventures . Jamin Eggert of La Jolla, California, who left his dedicated four-year engineering program at the University of California, San Diego, had a similar experience in 2009. ""I had dreamed of exploring hidden chambers and escaping in runaway coal cars since I first saw the 'Raiders' movies as a child,"" he said. ""Once the opportunity presented itself, I grabbed my hat and jacket and flew along the 'red arrow' over the Atlantic."" Taking part in an archaeological dig in Khirbat-en-Nahas, Jordan, was unforgettable for Eggert. ""It was an adventure in detailing history, and I am very fortunate to have been able to be a part."" The excavation was documented in a 2010 issue of ""National Geographic."" iReport: Eggert's memorable trip to Jordan . Jasmine Prater was also intrigued by archaeology at an early age, thanks to Indy, and studied geoarchaeology at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio.

"Washington (CNN) -- A 24-year-old Baltimore man was arrested at a major airport last week after 13 knives were discovered in his carry-on bag, authorities said Thursday. The man, who said he collected knives, was charged with three counts relating to possessing knives in an airport, authorities said. He was not charged with any terror-related counts. The incident occurred about 5:45 p.m. last Thursday at Baltimore-Washington International Airport near Baltimore. Police identified the traveler as Amr Gamal Shedid, 24. Shedid was charged with one count of possession of a dangerous concealed weapon, one count of carrying an unauthorized weapon into an airport and one count of interfering with security procedures of the airport, said Sgt. Kirk Perez of the Maryland Transportation Authority Police. Perez said the third count is a standard charge in incidents of this nature. As of Thursday, Shedid was being held at the Anne Arundel County Detention Center in Annapolis, Maryland, on $10,000 bail, which was increased at a bail hearing this week from $2,600. Jail personnel did not have the name of Shedid's attorney.","The man was arrested last week at Baltimore-Washington International Airport .

"Washington (CNN) -- Democrats and Republicans squared off in the 50th annual Congressional Baseball Game at Nationals Park Thursday night.

Cedric Richmond, D-Louisiana, shone on the mound for the Democrats going five innings before giving up a hit.

"(CNN) -- When sheriff's deputies arrested Casey Anthony in 2008 over the death of her 2-year-old daughter, few would have anticipated it would end like this: just days after her trial, jailers arranging a clandestine release launching the Orlando woman back into a world where her story could make her rich or put her life in danger. But that's precisely the scenario that will play out sometime Sunday when Anthony completes serving her time on four misdemeanor counts of misleading police. Anthony, 25, was acquitted July 5 of murder and child neglect charges in the death of her daughter, Caylee, whose skeletal remains were found in 2008 in a wooded field. She was convicted on four counts of misleading police and was sentenced to four years in prison. After serving nearly three years in prison while awaiting trial, she was ordered released this weekend. The abrupt end to a criminal case that at times transfixed the nation resulted in anger and revulsion as well as donations of cash to her jailhouse account. It's also led to speculation that the polarizing subject of the ""I Hate Casey Anthony"" Facebook page -- and the source of ire for its more than 40,000 fans -- might change her name and appearance and move someplace far away. ""If her attorneys are doing the right thing and are doing their jobs, they're going to have to explain to her that there is real hatred out there for her, that there have been death threats, that she cannot just walk amongst the population,"" HLN legal contributor Sunny Hostin said. ""That is not just going to happen."" Whatever she ends up doing, first she has to get out of jail. Few details have been publicly released about how Anthony will be let out of the Orange County Jail, where she has been held since her arrest in October 2008. Court officials have released limited information to reporters, mostly plans to bring three journalists inside a secure area of the jail sometime late Friday or early Saturday and cut them off from outside access while they wait for Anthony's release. When exactly Anthony will be freed hasn't been made public. That's in part likely due to the intense emotions Anthony's release has generated. ""I know it's bad God Forgive me but i hope someone wipes that smirk off her face. With a mack truck,"" one poster on the ""I Hate Casey Anthony"" Facebook page wrote. Another poster, referencing rumored lucrative interview, book and movie deals, said the only thing she'd pay to see or read would be about ""Casey Anthony's dead body."" The page features Anthony's mug shot with a bullseye target on her forehead under the headline ""Hey, Casey, I'd watch out if I were you, just sayin'."" An Oklahoma woman said she has already faced the kind of ire Anthony may face when she's no longer behind the protective walls of the Orange County Jail. Sammy Blackwell told CNN affiliate KOTV that a woman who mistook her for Anthony on July 8 rammed her car twice, flipping it over. ""She said that I was trying to hurt babies, I was killing babies and she was going to stop it before it happened again,"" Blackwell told the station. As it happens, Blackwell has a daughter named Caylee too, but that's the end of the similarities. She says she really doesn't even look that much like Anthony and worries for women who do. Sheriff Jerry Demings said Tuesday that investigators are assessing threats to Anthony's safety. While he said that the department was not aware of any credible threats to her life, it's a concern that was clearly on his mind. ""Nobody has a right to take the law in their own hands,"" he said. ""Casey Anthony had her day in court and the jury made a decision. I would hope people would step back and would not go out and commit another crime."" It's also a concern for her attorneys. ""Myself and other members of the team are concerned for her safety, very much so,"" one of her attorneys, Dorothy Sims, told HLN. What Anthony will do after her release is unclear. ""Well if I knew at this point I'm sure you can appreciate that I wouldn't' tell you,"" Sims said. ""I don't believe that that has been resolved. My hope for her would be that she would be left alone and her privacy would be respected."" Hostin said on CNN that she's heard reports that Anthony will go into hiding, live under an assumed name or get plastic surgery. ""But I think we are going to hear her story because people have offered her a million dollars already for her story,"" she said. Anthony also still has legal issues to deal with. Her criminal team is appealing her convictions for misleading police, and she is being sued in two separate actions in civil court. One is filed by a woman with the same name Anthony gave to investigators as the name of her daughter's nanny. The other involves a search group that wants Anthony to repay expenses they incurred looking for Caylee. Anthony may be offered money for book and movie deals, but one offer won't be on the table. Playboy founder Hugh Hefner told CNN's Piers Morgan that the magazine won't be offering Anthony a pictorial. ""I wouldn't reward someone like that for what has happened,"" Hefner said. Attorney J. Cheney Mason, who once said he thought of Anthony as a granddaughter, said he doesn't know what life holds in store for his client, but has hopes. ""She is only 25 year old. A decade from now, hopefully, she'll have some stability in her life and maybe a husband, and they can be somewhere in Montana and start over,"" he said.","NEW: ""I hate Casey Anthony"" Facebook page contains threatening posts .

"Spoiler alert: Please do not read on if you have not seen the last Harry Potter film yet. This article is entirely spoilers. If you DID see the movie last night, read on and tell us what you thought! Atlanta, Georgia -- If you're bleary-eyed and yawning after a late-night screening of ""Harry Potter's"" final movie installment, the lasting impressions of ""Deathly Hallows Part II"" are no doubt the only things keeping you awake today. Millions of ""Harry Potter"" fans flocked to midnight screenings, celebrating J.K. Rowling's epic conclusion with great enthusiasm and wizardly costumes. Here are some of the moments from the film that made fans gasp, applaud and giggle: . • The 3-D specs are in the shape of Harry's iconic round glasses! • When the Ukrainian Ironbelly guard dragon in Gringotts takes flight, it's a magical moment: The animation is some of the best fantasy fans have ever seen on screen. The beautiful and slinky movements of the dragon allow the viewers to suspend any disbelief, and this beast is a ""Harry Potter"" best. • Alan Rickman shows off his acting chops as Professor Snape. The Headmaster of Hogwarts' first deliciously evil line comes when he warns the students and staff that anyone who does not come forth with information regarding the whereabouts of Harry Potter will be found, ""Equally. Guilty,"" as those actively hiding him. The delivery is thrillingly sinister! • Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall unleashes her inner geek when she says, ""I've always wanted to use that spell,"" after rousing the stone knights to protect Hogwarts. • Yes, it's really the end: The first moment you realize this is the view of the quidditch field burning down as Voldemort's forces storm Hogwarts. • Hermione and Ron share a very sexy smootch. Finally, these two characters seal their love for one another with a kiss, and when the initial excitement of the scene wears off, viewers begin to realize that this is a very steamy and adult liplock. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson bring authenticity and spark to the scene. • Neville Longbottom has the hots for Luna and is ready to do something about it after steeling his nerves in battle. ""Have you seen Luna?"" he asks Harry. ""I've got the hots for her!"" • Snape's death scene is brutal, violent and elemental. Even though viewers don't get to see the killing, they hear it. The sound of an attacking Nagini is shocking in its intensity and the scene leaves the audience raw. • Moviegoers will need a Kleenex when Harry Potter put Snape's memories in the Pensieve. The scenes of Snape and Lily show a life of love, torture and loss that Alan Rickman masterfully embodies. • Did you know Gollum is in this movie? Voldemort's dead soul seems like it took a wrong turn in cinema purgatory and ended up in the ""Harry Potter"" film instead of one from the ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise. • Elitist wizards sure have some awful teeth! Both Voldemort's and Bellatrix Lestrange's grins during the final assault on Hogwarts are unsettling for all the wrong reasons. • Mrs. Weasley's besting of Bellatrix in their duel is sure to be a big hit with audiences. • When Neville slays Nagini with the sword of Gryffindor, it's the ultimate fantasy moment. In case you were wondering, Neville is a hero now. The beautifully rendered scene looks like an homage to Raphael's painting, ""St. George and the Dragon."" • Mr. Filch is so very grumpy as he settles in to clean up the rubble from the most significant battle in Hogwart's history. He is not amused. • In the epilogue, Draco's beard and Ron's pot belly are so bad they're good. What did you think of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II""?

"Orlando (CNN) -- The judge handling the defamation lawsuit against Casey Anthony has stepped away from the case, leaving open the question of whether the Orlando woman will have to submit to a formal interview by her accuser's lawyers just days after leaving jail. Judge Jose Rodriguez, after a 14 minute sidebar, announced without explanation that the case would be assigned to another judge. A new judge, Lisa Munyon, was assigned to the case later Friday morning. She was expected to hold another hearing Friday afternoon. Anthony, 25, is being sued in civil court by a woman named Zenaida Fernandez Gonzalez. Anthony told investigators that was the name of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee's nanny, and that the woman had taken the girl and disappeared. Investigators were never able to find evidence such a woman existed, but were able to find Gonzalez, who denied knowing Anthony or her daughter. Gonzalez said Anthony's accusations turned her life upside down and led to death threats against her and her children. Two-year-old Caylee's remains were found in a wooded field not far from the Anthony's home. Anthony was acquitted July 5 of murder and child neglect charges in her daughter's death. The jury did convict her of lying to investigators and she is expected to be released from jail on Sunday. The lawsuit is separate from those charges. Lawyers for Gonzalez want Anthony to answer their questions in a deposition on Tuesday. In seeking an emergency order forcing her to attend, they wrote that they expect her to leave the Orlando area and change her name, making it impossible to interview her. After the abbreviated morning hearing, Gonzalez attorney Keither Mitnik said there's no reason the deposition should not go on as scheduled. ""She's under subpoena, there's no protective order,"" he said. ""She better have her behind in that deposition."" But Anthony's attorney in the civil case, Charles Greene, said she can't be forced to sit for a deposition so soon after a trial that left her ""emotionally and mentally exhausted."" Greene also said he will be in trial on another case that day. If forced to attend the deposition, Greene said Anthony would invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. ""Consequently, the deposition would be nothing more than yet another media spectacle and frenzy,"" Greene wrote in court documents.","NEW: A new judge is assigned to the Casey Anthony defamation lawsuit .

"Riverside, California (CNN) -- A conservative county supervisor in Southern California wants to form the 51st state by seceding the region from California, saying the state's problems require ""radical"" solutions. ""Listen, I knew I'd be criticized. I learned in my tenure of being a politician for 19 years, sometimes you have to do radical things to get people's attention,"" Riverside County Supervisor Jeff Stone said on CNN Thursday. ""We have hit a nerve with citizens who are just fed up with business as usual in the state,"" Stone said. ""I'm talking about a secession plan from the state of California."" This week, the Riverside County Board of Supervisors gave the OK to Stone to hold a summit of California's local leaders to discuss remedies for the state's long list of woes -- including secession. But the county board stopped short of endorsing Stone's secessionist plan by insisting no taxpayer money be used for the conference. Stone has come up with a name for the new state: South California. It would be composed of 13 largely Republican counties, most of which are inland along the Nevada and Arizona state lines. The plan would exclude Los Angeles County, but would include Orange and San Diego Counties, both on the coast. Stone has a long list of grievances against the state and its legislators: high taxes and fees, inability to reform welfare programs, high unemployment and excessive regulations. ""What the state has done is they've been balancing their budgets on the backs of our local coffers. They've been stealing our sales tax, property tax,"" Stone said. ""The bottom line for me and my constituents is jobs. We are sending jobs out of the state of California by the train load."" Riverside County is among the hardest hit communities by the recession and mortgage meltdown, leaving many communities pockmarked with vacant homes, Stone said. ""We are the foreclosure capital of the world,"" Stone asserted. ""We have some areas of the county that have 25% unemployment. The average in Riverside County is about 15%."" Stone's plan seems a long shot, one analyst said. There have been at least 27 efforts for secession within parts of California since the 1800s, and none has been successful. Robert Melsh, a political science instructor at Mount San Jacinto College in San Jacinto, California, which is in Riverside County, said Stone's plan stunned him, largely because of the high cost of putting a secessionist plan before voters. He called it a ""scare tactic."" ""Insanity,"" Melsh said. ""I mean this is major surgery where we need a Band-Aid. ""It takes millions of dollars to get the signatures necessary to put up an initiative,"" Melsh added. Melsh also raised the question of getting a 51st state's government up and running. ""Where is he going to put the capitol? Disneyland?"" Melsh said. Stone, a pharmacist and owner of an innovative compounding pharmacy, said he drew the lines for a new state by picking 13 counties that were contiguous and fiscally conservative or moderate. A date for the summit of local leaders has yet to be scheduled, he said. CNN's Traci Tamura contributed to this report.","A Republican supervisor in Riverside County is fed up with California's financial woes .

"(CNN) -- As the blondest brat in the Harry Potter universe, actor Tom Felton has no qualms about portraying the theoretically unlikable Draco Malfoy. So why do so many fans devote themselves to ""Team Slytherin?"" Felton muses on the possibilities with CNN. CNN: You have a fairly active dialogue with your fans. Can you explain to the muggles why fans are so into ""Team Slytherin?"" Felton: I definitely can't answer; I have no idea. I'm always curious when 7-year-olds and 8-year-olds come up to me and say, ""Yeah, Draco's my favorite character."" I always think, ""Hmmm, I'm not sure if he should be."" I'm not sure. I've been told that people like a bad guy, or I guess people love to hate someone. I guess Draco has filled that role for quite a few years. But yeah, I'm ""Team Slytherin"" all the way. CNN: Was it ever difficult to play such a mean-spirited and dirisive character as Draco Malfoy? Felton: Nothing but joy. I took great joy in every minute of it. It was like playing the polar opposite of me, really. It was kind of easy to step into his shoes and be delightfully horrible to everyone around me. I really enjoyed it and it never struck me as being difficult. Which is a little strange, in itself. I guess there's an evil kid inside me waiting to get out. CNN: Is it ever possible for you to have a good hair day after a decade of bleaching your locks for the role? Felton: Not really. I'm just grateful that I still have hair on my head after that many years of dying it. So yeah, it's actually turned back to its normal condition and is in not bad shape. Thanks for asking. CNN: What kinds of perks do you get for being a part of the Harry Potter franchise? Do you get a lifetime supply of butter beer? Felton: I've yet to cash in that coupon. What perks? We get the DVD a week before it comes out. We've been a couple of times to the Orlando theme park, the Wizarding World, and when we're there we're usually told to drink as much butter beer as we like. So yeah, you could call that a lifetime supply, I guess. CNN: Harry Potter has established itself as a consequential fantasy franchise. Has it influenced your tastes or is there a different genre that inspires you? Felton: I'm sure Harry will go down as this kind of fantasy thriller, but I see it as everything. It's a romantic comedy, it's dark humor, it's kind of everything in every one of the films. It encompasses a lot. I'm not really a genre kind of guy. I don't like to label films with a genre. I like all films whether it's dark or light, love, hate, whatever it is, I enjoy it. CNN: Was it ever heroes vs. villains on the set? Did you have a ""Team Baddies?"" Felton: You mean as the actors? No, not really. Bear in mind, we usually spend about 2% of the day in character, the rest of it is just us. So most of it is just normal chat. I hate to sound boring! CNN: Do you have a favorite memory of your time spent on the Harry Potter films? Felton: I don't really have one, that's sort of like saying pick your favorite memory of the last 15 years. Everyone asks that. It's the whole experience. The people that we work with, the relationships that we've made, the costumes we got to wear and all the stupid stuff we got to do. It's just the whole experience really. it's very hard for me to pick one memory. CNN: What's the most unexpected thing about being a part of Harry Potter? Felton: I guess that we're still here. Every year we kind of said, ""When are the fans gonna get bored of these and move on?"" But they never did. Every year the fans got more and more excited by everything. And it's kind of crazy that we're still here today talking about it. That's definitely one of the things that surprised me the most about the whole thing. CNN: What is J.K. Rowling like? Felton: She's exceptionally down to earth. She's one of the most down to earth people I've met. She's very, very sweet -- I'm always blown away by how down to earth she is. She's a really, really nice person and it's always a pleasure getting a chance to hang out with her. CNN: So many people around the world are fans of Draco. What is Draco a fan of? Felton: Other than villainous ways? He's a fan of snakes. Slitherin. Evil deeds. You know what, it's weird because that's kind of a changing question. Because in the recent films I think it's slightly different. Probably freedom and, you know, not his parents. It's a tough one. He's a character with two sides.","Tom Felton can't explain why so many Harry Potter fans are on ""Team Slitherin""

"(CNN) -- Four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal formally announced his retirement from basketball Friday, thanking fans and teammates for their support and saying he looks forward to earning his Ph.D. ""It is now time for me to begin my new life,"" O'Neal said at a press conference at his home. Dale Brown, who coached him while at Louisiana State University, sat by O'Neal's side. The announcement was an upbeat occasion, with the athlete thanking his parents for stressing the importance of education, especially if he were to endure a career-ending injury. O'Neal is completing his doctorate in human resource development at Barry University in Miami. O'Neal first said Wednesday afternoon that he was going to hang up his jersey. The 39-year-old posted a link to a video on his Twitter account. In a brief message he said: ""We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much. That's why I'm telling you first. I'm about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon."" O'Neal has been dogged by injuries in the latter stages of his career and played only 37 games for the Boston Celtics this season after struggling with an Achilles tendon problem. He told reporters he did not want the Celtics to have to wait to see whether he fully rebounded from surgery. The superstar returned for two playoff games against the Miami Heat but managed just 12 minutes, and he told an ESPN reporter that he didn't want to let Celtics fans down. O'Neal won three titles with the Los Angeles Lakers after forming a devastating partnership with Kobe Bryant, and added a fourth in 2006 with the Miami Heat. With 28,596 points, O'Neal is fifth on the all-time NBA scoring list and is second only to Michael Jordan on the all-time list of NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Awards. ""I'm really going to miss the free throws,"" he quipped Friday. He began his career in 1992 when the Orlando Magic picked him first in the NBA Draft and quickly won rookie of the year honors. O'Neal took the NBA scoring title in 1995 as he led the Magic to the NBA finals, but they were beaten by Houston. He won the accolade again in 2000, when the Lakers won the finals.","Shaquille O'Neal first announced  his retirement Wednesday .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- As I write this from a conference of 3500 Harry Potter fans outside of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park in Orlando, the energy in the air around the final film is not only excitement, but gratitude. We are grateful for the bonds of friendship we have made in this fan community and grateful for those ""other friends"" we know we can always visit in Hagrid's hut, to sit down over tea and rock cakes and plot new adventures. We've spent years being called ""delusional"" for taking the Gryffindor Common Room, the Great Hall at Hogwarts, and the sweet shops in Hogsmeade so seriously -- as if they were real. As if they were nothing more than a cheap way to escape from our daily reality. But as the book comes to a close, Dumbledore reminds us that ""Of course it is happening inside [our] head...but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?"" Reality is mysterious. And the reality is that a fantasy book aimed at children has forever changed writing, publishing, literature, music, sports, social media and social activism. In a digital age filled with families lining up for iPods, iPads and iPhones, there was one exception to the rule: For well over a decade, millions lined up at midnight to get their hands on a copy of a hardback book. Translated into almost every language as it seamlessly cuts across cultures, Harry Potter became the most requested book by detainees in Guantanamo Bay (outside of the Quran). The reality is that Harry Potter has taught a generation to be creative, compassionate and courageous as we continue to love. For some, the final film means it's an end of an era. Not for me and not for most fans. As we approach the final film in the Potter franchise, I'd like to point out that the moment in book seven when a Golden Snitch Harry is holding ""opens at the close"" so too does the Harry Potter Generation -- our minds, our hearts, all open at the close. Like the snitch, we ""open at the close."" The advent of the seventh movie is not an ending, but an opportunity to take what we have learned at Hogwarts into the world. The organization that I run, the Harry Potter Alliance, inspiriing fellow fans to act as Harry would in our world. We've sent five cargo planes to Haiti, donated more than 88,000 books across the world and funded the protection of civilians in Darfur and Burma. Right now we are negotiating with the CEO of Warner Brothers to make all Harry Potter chocolate fair trade so that the Harry Potter brand is no longer associated with the practice of child slavery that is common in the cocoa trade. To date we have the signatures of more than 15,000 Harry Potter fans including four stars of the films. In a world that is, like Harry's, often in dark and difficult times, we in the Harry Potter Generation are ready to open at the close. We are ready Ms. Rowling, Harry, and Dumbledore.

"Seoul (CNN) -- South Korea demanded Tokyo withdraw a ban that asks Japanese diplomats to refrain from flying with Korean Air to protest a test flight above islets in the sea east of Korea that Japan claims is its territory. ""The government is taking this seriously, as the Japanese government in effect is placing sanctions on one of our private companies,"" the South Korean foreign ministry spokesman said in a briefing Thursday. The islets in the sea east of Korea, known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan, have been a prickly issue for the countries. Japan has long claimed the islets as its territory, but Seoul leaves no room for debate and says all Korean territory was returned after the country won independence from colonial rule by Japan in 1945. The Japanese government has shown no intention of stepping down from its recent move. ""Because Korean Air did a domain invasion to our Takeshima clearly this time, we have expressed our strong intention regarding this problem with Korean Air,"" the Japanese deputy foreign minister said. South Korea said it will consider various measures if Tokyo does not withdraw the measure that goes into effect Thursday. Seoul expressed strong disappointment at the move, saying it should not have been made given the relationship between the two countries. Korean Air, the country's largest airliner, carried out two test flights over Dokdo less than a month ago but did not comment on the Japanese government's decision. South Korea views the islets as a source of national pride and has taken various measures to reassert its ownership.

"(CNN) -- YouTube has made another match for a U.S. Marine looking to score a date to the Marine Corps Ball. Justin Timberlake said Friday that he will accept an invitation extended through a YouTube video by Cpl. Kelsey de Santis. ""If my schedule works out to do it, I'd love to do it. It's an honor,"" Timberlake said at a media event to promote the film ""Friends with Benefits."" De Santis made the video after Timberlake's ""Friends with Benefits"" co-star Mila Kunis received a similar invitation from a Marine serving in Afghanistan. ""If you can't go, all I have to say is 'Cry Me a River,' "" De Santis, flanked by a contingent of tough-looking male Marines, said on the video, referencing one of Timberlake's hit songs. Timberlake joked that he was not accepting ""because she shouted out one of my songs, which I love,"" but because ""I don't get asked out ever, so I was very flattered by that."" His acceptance comes one day after Kunis addressed rumors that work would keep her from her date, despite saying she would attend Sgt. Scott Moore's YouTube invitation to attend the Marine Corps Ball in Greenville, North Carolina. ""I will happily clear it up, once and for all,"" Kunis said Thursday. ""Never did I say that I was not going. ... I am attending. I'm going. November 18 I will be there.""

"(CNN) -- By giving away seeds and teaching people how to grow their own food, Holly Hirshberg is helping to fight hunger in the United States. Hirshberg is founder of The Dinner Garden, a nonprofit that has provided free packs of seeds to 65,000 families nationwide. The group also offers gardening supplies and tips. CNN's Allie Torgan recently spoke with Hirshberg about her group's efforts to help families during the recession. Allie Torgan: How easy is it for someone to take part in your program? Holly Hirshberg: Anybody who wants to garden with us can. They fill out the forms, and then we find between 10 and 11 varieties of seeds that will grow in their area. We package up those seeds into little bags, and we label them individually. We try to ship out stuff so people can grow year round. If you don't have an area to plant in your yard, grow in containers. You can grow on your front porch. You can grow in a window. People have more space to plant than they think they do. We had one gardener who grew on the headboard of her bed. Torgan: Along with the financial benefits of growing one's own food -- and the health benefits from eating nutritious foods -- how else does gardening help people? Hirshberg: When you're so stressed about being unemployed or about struggling to take care of your family -- which so many Americans struggle with every day -- it's so nice to have something to get your mind off it. It's a great place to spend family time. When you have a crisis like this, especially on a national level, people feel bad and want to be alone. And that's the time when it's most important to be around other people. You feel better getting out in the world and seeing that things are going on, and feeling that ... energy. When people were able to get out in their garden, they were able to feel like there's hope. Things are going to get better. Torgan: What's it like for you when you see kids holding fresh vegetables that came from your seeds? Hirshberg: It's wonderful. That's the reward. We work for no money, and to see that we are making a difference -- to see that people's lives are improving -- it's magical. It's brilliant. It doesn't matter how I'm staying up till 2 in the morning. It doesn't matter how hard I'm working ... the long hours. It's so worth it that I look at those children and I think: ""Those are going to be kids who never have to worry. That is a skill they will have forever."" Family is so important to me. And I love to see families doing things together. It's a nice way to bring them together. Parents and children are talking. Grandparents and children are talking. Neighbors and everybody are communicating, and I love that. Torgan: What are your future goals for The Dinner Garden? Hirshberg: We'd like to get through our waiting list (for free seeds). That's our main No. 1 goal because we do have so many people who still need our help. We would like to go into more educational things to teach people how to use the fruit and vegetables that they grow. And we'd like to teach some gardening classes. ... With just a couple minutes a day, you really can grow a lot of food for your family. You know, the seeds do all the work. That's what we tell our gardeners. We provide the seeds. We help you grow them. You eat the food. Goodbye hunger.

"(CNN) -- Southern California police on Friday closed their investigation into Hollywood publicist Ronnie Chasen's shooting death late last year, concluding that an ex-convict murdered her in a random, botched robbery. The suspect, 43-year-old Harold Martin Smith, pulled a handgun and shot himself last December as Beverly Hills detectives approached him at Hollywood's Harvey Apartments. But despite evidence even then tying Smith to Chasen's murder last November, authorities kept the case open. Beverly Hills police Lt. Tony Lee told CNN early this year that ""we hope to close it soon."" That decision came six months later. The city's police department issued a press release Friday stating that it had ""completed the exhaustive investigation"" by determining that Smith was ""the sole perpetrator of this most heinous crime."" ""All facts and evidence conclusively indicate that Mr. Smith acted alone and was in possession of the murder weapon when confronted in Hollywood for questioning"" the night he committed suicide, the Beverly Hills police department said. Chasen, 64, was driving last fall through a posh Beverly Hills neighborhood on her way home from a Hollywood movie premiere party when she was shot several times, police said. Speculation thrived after the shooting, including a theory that a professional hit man had targeted Chasen. That was until, at least, investigators began to hone in on Smith. ""With Mr. Smith's background, we believe most likely it was a robbery gone bad,"" Beverly Hills Detective Sgt. Mike Publicker said in December 2010. ""We believe it was a random act."" Yet authorities continued to look into the case, with Police Chief David Snowden saying then that the investigation was just ""60% to 70% complete."" Still, through Friday, police never indicated that anyone other than Smith was ever a suspect. Detectives scanned 150,000 e-mails and texts belonging to Chasen, investigated thousands of tips and reviewed thousands of financial documents tied to the victim, Beverly Hills police said Friday. They also revisited Chasen's route on the night of her murder, recovered video footage and conducted numerous interviews with relatives, friends, contacts and others. Ultimately, the most telling piece of evidence was that the gun that fired several rounds into Chasen's chest was the same weapon Smith used to kill himself when police approached to question him about her death. ""Beverly Hills police personnel assigned to this case worked in excess of 10,000 hours to thoroughly investigate each and every tip, theory and legitimate lead in order to bring this investigation to conclusion,"" the police statement said.","Beverly Hills police say Harold Martin Smith killed Ronnie Chasen last fall .
They reach this conclusion after police spent 10,000 hours on the probe .
Smith, an ex-convict, was the only person ever identified as a suspect .
Police say he killed Chasen in a botched robbery, then later killed himself ."
"(CNN) -- A New Jersey man pleaded not guilty Friday to stealing a pencil-on-paper Picasso sketch from a San Francisco gallery last week, his defense attorney said. Mark Lugo, 30, was charged with three counts -- burglary, grand theft and possession of stolen property -- and pleaded not guilty to all counts, according to his attorney, Douglas Horngrad. Police have estimated the value of the piece at around $275,000, though Horngrad said it is not worth nearly that much. The New Jersey man was arrested in Napa, California on July 6, police have said. His bail was set at $5 million dollars. He is accused of entering the Weinstein Gallery in San Francisco on July 5, walking straight to the painting, removing it and walking back out, police have said. The artwork, ""Tete de Femme,"" or ""Head of a Woman,"" was drawn in 1965. Following his arrest in San Francisco, New York police tied Lugo to surveillance footage from another theft at a New York City hotel. Lugo was allegedly seen lifting a $350,000 Fernand Leger sketch from the Carlyle Hotel on June 28, according to Hoboken Detective Sergeant Edwin Pantoja. After viewing the surveillance video, police obtained a search warrant for Lugo's Hoboken, New Jersey apartment early Wednesday, Pantoja said. There, authorities found eleven paintings hung on the walls, he added. ""A mini-exhibit was going on in the apartment,"" said Pantoja. The artworks -- which included another Picasso piece -- were allegedly stolen from seven different Manhattan galleries in June and July, according to a statement issued Friday by New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. The eleven pieces have a combined value totaling more than $420,000, police said. Following the discovery in Lugo's New Jersey apartment, New York police issued a warrant for his arrest. Lugo faces extradition to New York on suspicion of grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property, said Browne. Given that all the pieces were allegedly pinched during the last 45 days, Lugo appears to be ""someone in the midst of a manic, compulsive exercise rather than an art-thief,"" his San Francisco attorney said. Horngrad added that Lugo ""had no intention to sell the pieces."" Lugo will next appear in San Francisco court on August 23, his lawyer said.","Mark Lugo is accused of stealing a Picasso sketch from a San Francisco gallery last week .

"Los Angeles (CNN)  -- My rosary-packing mom taught me not to say that four-letter word that begins with ""h,"" not talking about hell but hate. But she forbids lying, too, so I am going to be straight -- I HATE driving on the 405 Freeway. I avoid the 405 like poison oak, or wild-eyed people you randomly meet on story shoots who want you to pitch their product. The 405 is a time bandit, a concrete thief that steals hours as you take agonizing drives in awful traffic. Quakes, riots, Lohan and now this? l live in the San Fernando Valley, but the 405 is a mandatory evil for times when I must head to LAX for CNN trips or vacation. I tolerate the 405 by blasting the radio or stopping at Tito's Tacos in Culver City like it's some oasis. The only thing more horrendous than the 405 is the 405 in rush hour. The only thing more horrendous than the 405 in rush hour is the 405 in rush hour during an accident. The only thing worse than the 405 in rush hour during an accident is to throw in construction. 'Carmageddon' officially on in Los Angeles . The 405 defines relationships. A budding romance might wilt under pressure of having to drive or cross the 405 for a rendezvous. True friends will endure the 405's whims. The 405 tests commitment -- to work, athletic teams and even family. My relatives who are clustered up the 101 Freeway in Solvang and points beyond fortunately have zero reason to drive the 405 to get to my house, But to them, the 405 is a barrier they still must navigate in Encino, like the Alps, or the Straits of Magellan. During ""Carmageddon"" I will test whether it's faster to fly from Burbank to Long Beach via JetBlue or just drive it. I will win this contest because it takes time to board a plane, and I can mainly avoid the 405. I'll slip around and past it, using the almost as heinous Interstate 5 and the 710 to get to Long Beach. The 405 is almost completely out of range as I maneuver far away from its reach, as if I'm dodging English archers. But for all my abject hate for the 405, I want this billion-dollar HOV lane, improvement and overhaul to work. I am rooting for the pain to be eased by new lanes, bridges, on ramps, off ramps interchanges and attitude.","CNN senior producer Paul Vercammen: ""I HATE"" driving the 405 Freeway .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles survived what officials warned could have been a traffic nightmare this weekend when a section of one of the nation's busiest freeways, closed for construction, was reopened ahead of schedule Sunday. ""Carmadegeddon, shmarmageddon,"" said Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, as he and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa announced at midday Sunday that Interstate 405 would reopen 17 hours before Monday's morning rush hour begins. Despite Los Angeles' reputation as ""the car capital of the United States of America, the congestion capital, the city most addicted to the single-passenger automobile,"" motorists found alternatives to driving for the weekend, Mayor Villaraigosa said. A 10-mile segment of the freeway was closed Friday night to allow crews to demolish a section of bridge to make way for a car pool lane. Workers completed the demolition faster than expected, Mayor Villaraigosa said Sunday morning. ""The fact that we were able to do it sooner meant that things went very, very smoothly,"" Villaraigosa said Sunday. ""Had they not, we might have had this press conference on Monday afternoon."" Barriers that had detoured northbound and southbound traffic away from the 405 since late Friday were removed at noon Sunday, with the opening of interchanges and ramps to follow. The real story may be how Los Angeles residents reacted to dire warnings to keep their cars parked or else get struck in predicted gridlock that Yaroslavsky had dubbed Carmadegeddon. The number of cars driving on Los Angeles roads dropped a dramatic two-thirds Saturday, Yaroslavsky said. ""I propose a yearly carmageddon holiday! What a lovely chill summer day in Santa Monica,"" resident Novena Carmel said in a Twitter posting Saturday afternoon. Yaroslavsky and Villaraigosa both agreed Sunday, sounding as if they were only half-joking. ""I like the idea of us taking a time out once a year,"" Villaraigosa said. ""I think everybody has realized that we can get out of our car once in a while and survive."" The mayor said he was pleased with reports of ""people going to their neighborhood restaurants, going to a coffee shops, talking with neighbors, having family dinners or barbecues that they might not otherwise have done in the rat race that we live in."" In fact, the city will do it again in 11 months when the second half of the Mulholland bridge is demolished to complete the expansion project. While fear of gridlock motivated the change in habits this time, Yaroslavsky suggested Los Angeles residents may have learned an unexpected lesson. ""I think a lot of people in Los Angeles have learned that you can get along without taking long rides in your cars on weekends these past couple of days,"" he said. ""There's a feeling in Los Angeles that if you don't get in your car on a weekend that you're somehow being cheated of something."" Demolition of a section of the southern half of the Mulholland bridge, necessary to make room for a northbound car pool lane, was expected to keep the freeway closed for 53 hours, ending at 5 a.m. Monday, the start of the morning rush hour. Crews closed ramps late Friday on the 405, where it passes over the Santa Monica Mountains, California Department of Transportation officials said. The $1.2 billion construction project calls for replacing a portion of a bridge at Mulholland Drive, a mountain summit road that is featured in many Hollywood films, authorities said. A year from now, crews will have to shut down the 405 again to replace a final portion of the Mulholland Drive bridge, officials said. The project also calls for adding a car-pool lane in each direction, creating ""the largest HOV system in the world"" at 48.6 miles in length between the San Fernando Valley and Orange County, said Mike Miles, the California Department of Transportation's director for Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The two-year project will replace two more bridges, also to accommodate the widening of the 405, and will improve about two dozen on-off ramps and add 18 miles of sound-deadening walls for nearby residents, Miles said. The 405 is usually one of the busiest freeways in the country, carrying about 500,000 cars a day through the Sepulveda Pass, a critical artery connecting Californians along the coast. The 405 achieved notoriety on national television as the corridor that former NFL player O.J. Simpson used as he was being slowly chased by police in 1994. The highway also cuts through the west side of Los Angeles, an area that includes the high-status communities of Bel Air, Brentwood, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica.

"Jerusalem (CNN)  -- A new Israel Defense Forces order aimed at preventing infiltration in the West Bank is sparking angry condemnations in the Palestinian Authority. The order, which will take effect on Wednesday, poses a threat to thousands of Palestinians who will now be considered illegal under the new regulations. The new order is in fact an amendment to an existing order from 1969. It extends the definition of an infiltrator to ""a person who is present in the area and does not lawfully hold a permit."" The order threatens those defined as infiltrators with deportation or imprisonment of up to seven years. It is unclear from the wording of the document -- signed six months ago by the commander of the IDF in the West Bank at the time, Maj. Gen. Gadi Shamni -- exactly who would fall under the new provisions. Clauses in the order state that ""a person is an infiltrator if he is present in the area without a document or a permit indicating his lawful presence in the area without reasonable justification."" A permit would be a document ""issued by the commander of IDF forces in the Judea and Samaria area or someone acting on his behalf, or issued by the authorities of the State of Israel,"" according to the document, using the Israeli terminology referring to the West Bank. The human rights organization Hamoked and nine other rights groups urgently appealed to the Israeli defense minister, demanding postponement of the implementation of the order that the groups said ""will turn all residents of the West Bank into criminals."" Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said in a statement: ""These military orders belong in an apartheid state. Extensive in scope, they make it infinitely easier for Israel to imprison and expel Palestinians from the West Bank. They are an assault on ordinary Palestinians, and an affront to the most fundamental principles of human rights."" He added, ""These orders have the effect of turning Palestinians into criminals in their own homes, while directly undermining the efforts of Palestinians to run their own internal affairs. They also open the flood gate for Israel to target foreign-born spouses, foreign workers, and even Israeli citizens as 'infiltrators', as well as anyone participating in demonstrations in support of Palestinian rights and against Israel's occupation."" Erakat said the order reveals ""the invidious design behind Israel's settlement policy. ""The fewer Palestinians there are in the West Bank, including in occupied East Jerusalem, the more settlers there will be. Israel's endgame is not peace. It is the colonization of the West Bank."" An IDF spokesman told CNN: ""The purpose of the order which was signed by the ... central command and which is scheduled to become affective on April 14th, is the extradition of those residing illegally in Judea and Samaria. This is a preexisting order which has no change with regard to who is illegal or illegal. There was a correction to ensure judicial oversight of the extradition process"".","Rights groups say order turns all West Bank residents into criminals .

"(CNN) -- After three years in jail and a ""trial of the century,"" Casey Anthony is free. But the 25-year-old Florida woman faces an uncertain future and an uphill battle as she re-enters society. Anthony was released from jail Sunday, 12 days after a jury acquitted her on murder and child neglect charges related to the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. Following the polarizing verdict, public opinion was not on Anthony's side. The fact that she was given credit for time served on a four-year sentence for lying to police, allowing for her release this weekend, seems to have only added fuel to the fire. The ""I hate Casey Anthony"" Facebook page has more than 45,000 fans; the ""F--- Casey Anthony"" page has more than 775,000. There are more dedicated to keeping her from seeking refuge in Puerto Rico, Europe, Oregon, Texas and Virginia, among other locales. Death threats and unkind words abound in the social media realm, and in the real world, Anthony's civil attorney, Charles Greene, said he's received several death threats directed at his client. Is Casey Anthony in danger? Anthony is not the first acquitted defendant to face an unadmiring public upon her release. She's been compared to O.J. Simpson, Michael Jackson and Mary Winkler, the Tennessee woman who served less than two months in jail on a manslaughter conviction for shooting her preacher husband. But even they had the benefit of a support network -- friends, family, entourage -- to help them get back on their feet (at least for a little while). ""The first thing Casey Anthony needs to do is go to comfort zone and I don't know where that safe place, that happy place is for her. She's going to need counseling and comforting from others. The question for her is where will she find the others?"" said defense lawyer Steve Farese Sr., who represented Mary Winkler in her 2007 trial. ""My advice to her would be to grow up: you lost three years in prison, try to get your life on the right track. I'd advise her to move from the community in which she lived. I might even advise her to change her name and be careful who your friends are, because there will be people who want to latch on to her infamy."" Plans for her release from the Orange County Booking and Release Center in Orlando reflected the extraordinary level of scrutiny that the case has received. Law enforcement didn't reveal the time of her release or her precise exit point from the sprawling facility. Three journalists -- one still photographer, one videographer and a print reporter -- were admitted into the facility Saturday night to document her release, but they weren't allowed to share any information until she left the grounds. Beyond that point, she was to be treated just like any other inmate leaving the custody of the state, Orange County Sheriff Jeffrey Demmings told reporters Thursday. ""We will not be providing any elaborate security protection for Casey once she leaves,"" he said. ""We don't pick up security concerns unless there's a credible threat."" It's unclear where Anthony will head to first for comfort or support. She turned down a jailhouse visit from her mother after the verdict and her lawyers have implied that there's no reunion with her parents planned in the immediate future. No friends have come forward to publicly speak on her behalf. Her most vocal defenders have been her lawyers, who have expressed fear for her safety in light of public outrage over the verdict and sentence. ""People support her more theoretically than personally. They'll say the verdict shows the system works, stop second-guessing it. That's the support she's receiving, rather than people supporting her personally or what she did,"" said California criminal defense lawyer Mark Geragos, who represented convicted wife killer Scott Peterson in what was referred to at the time as the ""trial of the century."" The most apparent sign that she has any supporters comes from her jailhouse commissary account, which showed nearly $500 in donations from strangers across the United States and Canada. (The money paid for snacks like jalapeño nachos, peanut M&Ms and a strawberry toaster pastry, as well as cosmetics and toiletries: mascara, toothpaste and ponytail holders.) Otherwise, Anthony lacks the financial backing that allowed Simpson and Jackson to seek refuge in foreign countries while the heat died down. Simpson spent years resuscitating his career in Japan after he was acquitted of murder charges in the death of wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ron Goldman. Jackson wound up in Bahrain, at the invitation of the king's son, after his acquittal on child molestation charges. Anthony also lacks the support of friends, family and a group of sympathetic well-wishers that awaited Winkler upon her release from the mental health facility where she received treatment as part of her sentence. Winkler had a job at a laundromat in McMinnville, Tennessee, and a custody battle for her two daughters awaiting her. ""The main thing that Mary had is, she had the goal of getting her children back. She had a purpose and when you have a purpose that keeps you going every day,"" said Farese, Winkler's attorney. Some certainties lie ahead for Anthony, all drawing her back into the justice system. Her lawyers have filed notices of intent to appeal her four misdemeanor convictions. The move is widely considered to be strategic, as it will allow her to claim her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in the various civil suits piling up against her. Among those parties is search and rescue group Texas EquuSearch, which claims that Anthony misled them into providing more than $112,000 in services in an unnecessary attempt to locate Caylee for months despite knowing she was dead. Anthony is also being sued for defamation by a woman named Zenaida Gonzalez. Anthony told investigators that was the name of Caylee's nanny and that the woman had taken her daughter. The judge handling the defamation lawsuit set Anthony's deposition for October 8, despite requests from attorneys for Gonzalez, who said they feared she might disappear after her release from jail. Apart from $537.68 she received from her inmate account, Anthony appears to be broke. Her lawyers declared her indigent before the trial began and have been defending her free of charge. But there could be money for her in her story down the road. Son of Sam laws, which prevent criminals from profiting off their crimes, would not apply to her. Could Casey Anthony get a reality show? Attorneys who spoke with CNN said they would not advise her against selling her story after the fervor has died down. ""The problem is, people get antsy or feel like they've got to do something or monetize their 15 minutes. She doesn't immediately need to be doing interviews, photo shoots, anything to bring any attention to herself,"" Geragos said. ""The public has a very short memory, and if she waits an appropriate period of time, people will move on to the next scandal du jour and she'll probably be able to build a life for herself sooner than she thinks."" Really, Mr. Geragos? ""Yes. Come September, when the Conrad Murray case comes along, people will be focused on that, or an arrest or trial will come soon that will eclipse this,"" he said. ""I've seen too many so-called 'trials of the century' that happen biannually.""","Casey Anthony lacks family, friends, supporters to help her get back on feet .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan national guard troops have rescued some inmates from a prison where a standoff between prisoners and authorities continued Tuesday, but hundreds more remain inside. Armed inmates inside the Rodeo II prison in the northern state of Miranda, east of Caracas, have rejected government calls to disarm since last week. According to the government, a group of about 50 inmates out of 1,000 is behind the resistance. Authorities had already raided another prison, Rodeo I, and seized a number of weapons, drugs and cell phones. Two troops and one inmate were killed in that raid, officials said. On Monday night, a national guard contingent rescued 36 inmates from the ""mafias"" that have control of Rodeo II, the state-run AVN news agency reported. Eleven were injured in the operation. About 3,500 troops were surrounding the Rodeo II prison, the agency reported. The operations at the Rodeo prison complex come a week after a prison riot that left 22 dead. According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the riot reportedly revolved around a fight between rival gangs for control of the prison. The inmates allegedly attacked each other with weapons, the commission said. Details of the situation inside Rodeo II are hard to come by. However, a video that surfaced on YouTube purports to show the scene inside one of the prisons. The video, which was aired by Venezuelan news outlet Reportero 24, shows what appears to be the inside of a prison filmed by one of the inmates. The date the video was shot and the location where it was shot were not verified. In the video, two white freezers are shown and opened. Inside each, there is one body. ""We have to keep them in the freezer, so they don't rot,"" the narrator says. He describes the bodies as ""two of the compatriots who have died in the fight."" If indeed both of the deceased are from inside one of the Rodeo prisons, it would increase the official death toll. As the video pans away from the freezers, noises like gunfire can be heard. The narrator blames officials for firing on the inmates. ""Listen! We are not lying,"" he says. Conditions in Venezuelan prisons have been the subject of concern for human rights organizations for some time. According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, 476 inmates reportedly died in Venezuelan prisons in 2010 and another 967 were injured. From 1999 to 2010, a total of 4,506 inmates reportedly died and 12,518 were injured, the commission found. As far back as 2008, the commission had issued orders to reform and regain control of Rodeo I. In another report, the commission found that ""the state has failed to adopt an effective policy to prevent violence within its detention centers"" and that ""Venezuelan prisons are the most violent in the region."" A recent feature by The New York Times looked at the San Antonio prison in Porlamar, on Margarita Island. The rule of authority had deteriorated so much there, the paper found, that it ""looks more like a Hugh Hefner-inspired fleshpot than a stockade for toughened smugglers."" The prisoners there run the show, one inmate told the paper. Among the problems that the commission cited were inmates' possession of weapons, extortion of inmates, overcrowding and lack of medical care. The Inter-American Commission has repeatedly recommended -- and reaffirmed after last week's riot -- reducing the overcrowd conditions, confiscating weapons, and establishing a division between those who are being prosecuted and those who have been convicted. The commission also recommended better trained guards and better investigations into acts of violence inside the prisons.","A standoff over weapons continues to brew at the Rodeo II prison .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's foreign minister resigned Saturday, part of a reshuffling of Egypt's government in the face of continued demonstrations calling for reforms. Prime Minister Esam Sharaf accepted the submitted resignation of Mohamed el-Orabi, who had been in office for less than a month, according to foreign ministry spokesman Menha Bakhoum. The move came amid continued change in Egypt's government, with Sharaf announcing Saturday that Hazem Al-Beblawy and Ali Al-Selmy had been appointed as deputy prime ministers. Beblawy will oversee economy-related matters while Selmy will head ""the political development and the democratic transition,"" according to a release on the Egyptian cabinet's website. These developments come as public pressure has intensified in recent weeks. Some Egyptians are claiming that the reforms instituted since President Hosni Mubarak stepped down February 11 are not significant enough. Several people working within the current government have been criticized for allegedly being too close to the former leader and those who helped suppress protests last winter. Thousands of disgruntled pro-democracy activists have again descended on Cairo's Tahrir Square, setting up tents in the iconic roundabout that was the hub of the uprising earlier this year. The exact circumstances surrounding Orabi's resignation are unknown, though he had a long history of government service in Mubarak's government. A former deputy foreign minister for foreign affairs, he became foreign minister in June in place of Nabil Elaraby. Elaraby was elected in May to head the 22-member Arab League after Amre Moussa decided to be a candidate in the next presidential elections in Egypt. Orabi served in the Egyptian Army before he joined the foreign service in 1976. He was deputy ambassador in Tel Aviv, Israel, from 1994 to 1998 and has worked in Kuwait, London and Washington. He held the position of ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2008. There was no immediate word on who might succeed Orabi as foreign minister.

"(CNN) -- Two-time Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso has signed a three-year deal with Ferrari that will keep him at the Italian motorsport giants until 2016. The Spaniard has only been with Ferrari for one full season after joining from McLaren at the end of the 2009 campaign but has stated his desire to finish his career with the team. ""I am very happy to have reached this agreement,"" Alonso said on Ferrari's official web site. ""I immediately felt comfortable within Ferrari and now it feels to me like a second family. ""I have the utmost faith in the men and women who work in Maranello and in those who lead them: it is therefore natural for me to decide to extend my relationship in the long term like this, with a team at which I will no doubt end my Formula One career one day."" Alonso missed out on the drivers' championship by four points to Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel in 2010 but has suffered a disappointing start to the current campaign. He is fifth in the standings, 52 points behind leader Vettel, but did claim his first podium finish at the Turkish Grand Prix earlier this month. Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo said of the new deal: ""It is a great pleasure to have renewed our agreement with a driver who has always demonstrated a winning mentality even in the most difficult circumstances. ""Fernando has all the required qualities, both technically and personally to play a leading role in the history of Ferrari and I hope he will be enriching it with further wins very soon."" Vettel has spoken of his desire to represent the Italian team one day, but with Ferrari's other driver, Brazilian Felipe Massa, having another season after this to run on his contract, it won't happen until 2013 at the earliest. There had also been speculation that Ferrari would pursue an interest in McLaren's English driver and 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton, but he is tied to the British-based team until 2012. Alonso has competed in 23 races with Ferrari, with five wins, 11 podiums, two pole positions and 293 world championship points to his name. Mwanwhile, MotoGP could be set to expand for the 2012 season. The sport's governing body said 11 teams boasting 16 riders had advanced to the next stage of selection to compete in the motorbike world championship.","Fernando Alonso extends his contract with Ferrari until 2016 .

"(CNN) -- An aspiring astronaut steals a safe full of moon rocks worth millions to impress his girlfriend. Sounds like the pitch to the latest Hollywood heist movie, and it may soon end up on the big screen, but this story really happened and now it's become one of the summer's most buzzed-about books. Best-selling author Ben Mezrich has turned the true-life caper into ""Sex on the Moon: The Amazing Story Behind the Most Audacious Heist in History."" Mezrich chronicles the exploits of Thad Roberts, a 25-year-old NASA trainee who in 2002 stole 17 pounds of moon rocks from Johnson Space Center, got caught and went to federal prison. Roberts claims he did it all in the name of love. This is the 12th book from Harvard graduate who has created his own subgenre of nonfiction, chronicling the stories of young geniuses, some with questionable ethics, who challenge the establishment in a quest to make millions, even billions of dollars. Mezrich's ""Bringing Down the House,"" about MIT students who won big at blackjack, was turned into the 2008 movie, ""21."" His previous book ""The Accidental Billionaires,"" became the Oscar-winning movie, ""The Social Network"" last year. Now ""Sex on the Moon"" is climbing the best-seller lists, getting rave reviews and is also headed for a Hollywood adaptation. CNN spoke with the author, who's now on a national tour promoting his book. The following is an edited transcript of our interview: . CNN: This sounds more like a Hollywood heist movie, but amazingly ""Sex on the Moon"" is a true story. What led you to write it? Mezrich: Actually, Thad's story came to me. Soon after he was released from prison, he reached me through mutual friends; he'd read my stuff in prison and wanted to tell me his story. Ever since ""Bringing Down The House"" and especially since ""The Social Network"" every genius kid who pulls of a scheme calls me, but this story was different -- it really blew my mind. I'd always wanted to write about NASA, because when you think of NASA you think of the '60s, the Apollo stuff, not the NASA of today. Thad's story was a great way to get inside one of the most amazing places on earth. 'The Hypnotist' unleashes terrifying events . CNN: Tell me more about Thad Roberts, the man at the center of your book. Mezrich: Thad is the most complex character I've ever written about. He's brilliant, charismatic, very nice, and yet he did this crazy thing that derailed his life and ruined his dreams. He fell in love, did something stupid for love -- but more than that, he became this James Bond character. Usually, the geeky guys I write about do what they do because they can't get laid. Thad was kind of the opposite. He got in trouble because he could get the girl. CNN: Where is Roberts now? Mezrich: Utah. When he got out of prison, he went back to the University of Utah to finish his Ph.D. Currently, I think he's looking for somewhere else to continue that work -- he's got a theory of physics he's been working on, and he's really out there. He's an intense, interesting person, so I have no idea what's next for him. 'Social Network' scores big at the Golden Globes . CNN: Hollywood turned your last book, ""The Accidental Billionaires"" into the Oscar-winning film, ""The Social Network."" I understand similar plans are under way for ""Sex on the Moon."" Mezrich: Yes, the same producers from ""The Social Network"" are making ""Sex On The Moon."" Scott Rudin, Dana Brunetti, Mike DeLuca, Kevin Spacey. They are unbelievable talents and it's amazing to have them making this. It's with Sony/Columbia Pictures again, they've done such great things with my previous two movies. It's going to be awesome. And hopefully ""Sex On The Moon"" will be my first movie that keeps the title of the book! How can you not love ""Sex On The Moon?"" CNN: I understand your wife helped you come up with the book title? Mezrich: Yes, she was the dirty mind behind ""Sex On The Moon."" In the story, Thad actually spread some moon rocks on a bed and had sex with his girlfriend on them, so that's where it comes from. But I think it's very catchy. Author: Watch out for 'the accident people' CNN: You've written about card-counting math geniuses, Facebook billionaires, and a failed moon- rock heist. They all show a darker side of the American dream, so what draws you to these stories? Mezrich: I live vicariously through my subjects. I try to be Hunter S. Thompson without the drugs, guns, and alcohol. I am fascinated by geeks turned rock stars, by smart people who do crazy things, by stories involving sex, money and betrayal. It's what I like to read and watch so it's what I like to write. CNN: What are you working on next? Mezrich: A couple of projects, a documentary TV show where I go inside these wild stories every week, a scripted show idea or two, but I don't have my next book yet. I'm waiting for someone to call me with a crazy enough story.","""Sex on the Moon"" chronicles the true story of Thad Roberts .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russia has lifted a ban on some fresh vegetable imports from the European Union as of Tuesday, a senior official said. Gennady Onishchenko, head of Russia's state consumer protection watchdog, said vegetables from Belgium and the Netherlands are now allowed into the country. Moscow banned imports of fresh vegetables from the European Union earlier this month following an outbreak of E. coli in Germany that is blamed for 47 deaths. French health officials said Monday the same strain of E. coli appeared to have resurfaced in an outbreak in the Bordeaux area that has left nine people in need of hospital treatment. Onishchenko told Russian news agencies that Belgium and the Netherlands were the first to have the vegetable import ban lifted because they have reliable laboratories and because no one there has been affected by the recent cases of E. coli. The Netherlands is Russia's biggest supplier of fresh vegetables, providing one-third of such imports in monetary terms, he is quoted as saying. The two countries will have to provide certificates for their exports, stating their origin and that they are safe, he said. Poland, Lithuania, Spain, Denmark and the Czech Republic are on a ""waiting list"" and may be allowed access to the Russian market again if certain conditions are met, Onishchenko added. European Union nations exported about 600 million euros worth of vegetables to Russia last year, according to the European Commission. Both the French and German outbreaks have been linked to sprouted salad seeds. An investigation in Bordeaux suggested the seeds concerned were supplied by a British company, but no definitive link has been established, an official with France's economy ministry said. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control said on Monday the number of deaths in the outbreak centered in Germany had risen to 47, including one death in Sweden.","NEW: Five other countries on a ""waiting list"" to resume vegetable exports to Russia .

"(CNN) -- High temperatures in America's Plains States are expected to rival those in Death Valley again Monday, according to the National Weather Service, which predicts a heat wave to roast the county's midsection for yet another day as it spreads to the east. The hottest spots located in Oklahoma through South Dakota should see highs over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and top temps are forecast in the 90's for most of the rest of the county -- with the exception of some mountain and coastal regions. Much of middle America baked in a heat wave Sunday, and the National Weather Service declared excessive heat warnings in at least 14 states, most of those in the upper Midwest. Several daily temperature records were broken -- from Alpena, Michigan, south to Miami, Florida. ""Heat index values"" -- how hot it feels outside -- have been running over 125 degrees Fahrenheit in the worst-hit areas, the National Weather Service said. The scale designed to describe how intense heat feels also includes factors such as humidity. ""This is the hottest it's been for the longest period of time,"" said Emily McNamara from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where the temperatures were expected to hover in the mid-90s through the middle of the week. Extreme heat is forecast to bear down on the eastern United States by the end of this week. Jacob Beitlich, a Des Moines, Iowa-based meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said that two factors contribute to make this current heat wave especially dangerous: the lack of a significant drop in temperatures overnight to allow people's bodies to cool down and relatively high humidity, which makes it feel appreciably hotter than the thermostat may indicate. In Iowa, for instance, he noted that the impact of mid-90s temperatures have been compounded by relatively high dew points in the upper 70s and low 80s. These combine to make the heat index -- a meteorological measure for how it feels outside -- spike so that it feels as hot as 126 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the weather service. ""That takes a toll on your body,"" Beitlich explained. ""When it's more humid, it's more difficult to cool down from sweating.""  Prevent heat-related illnesses . The National Weather Service notes that typically extreme heat is the biggest weather-related killer in the United States, taking about 115 lives each year. That's why it and other government agencies urge people to minimize their time outdoors in periods of extreme heat, drink plenty of fluids, and keep especially close tabs on the elderly and young people. In Missouri scores of cooling centers have been established in libraries, senior centers, schools and other sites around the state to help deal with continuously high temperatures. At Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota Twins supporters stood in long lines to get water from coolers, used spray fans, wrapped wet towels on their head during a Sunday game -- anything to keep cool. ""It is blistering out,"" said one fan, Jeff Ferris. ""Brutal. I've probably lost 10 pounds today -- it's crazy."" While the recent stretch has been particularly difficult, it's all part of what's been a continuously long, hot and in many cases dry summer in numerous locales. The weather service indicates that Oklahoma, for instance, already has had 27 days this year in which the temperature surpassed 100 degrees. Not everyone in the region sweat it out though this weekend. McNamara notes that the Wild West Waterpark, where she is aquatic manager, has had ""record-breaking days in terms of attendance"" in recent days, with several thousand flooding in to get wet and beat the heat. ""It's awesome,"" she said. ""You see people coming out having fun. It makes for a fast day."" CNN's Ted Rowlands and Jacqui Jeras contributed to this report.","NEW: No break from the heat Monday, says the National Weather Service .

"(CNN) -- A Continental Airlines jetliner flew with one engine powered by a mix of oils from algae and jatropha plants Wednesday in what the plane's manufacturer called an ""outstanding"" test flight. Continental Airlines is the third commercial carrier to test biofuels in their planes. The Boeing 737 burned less fuel in the biofuel-powered engine than a conventionally powered engine, and the two performed identically during the one-hour, 40-minute flight, Boeing spokesman Terrance Scott said. ""There was no hesitation at all,"" Scott said. ""If you had to grade it on a scale of one to 10, it would be an 11."" Wednesday's test, conducted from Continental's hub in Houston, Texas, was the first by a U.S. carrier and the first to use a blend of oils from algae and the jatropha, Scott said. One engine ran on a 50-50 mix of that combination with conventional jet fuel, while the other ran entirely on conventional fuel. The 737 is one of the most common aircraft in service in U.S. markets. A crew of two pilots and an engineer put the jet through a series of exercises, including measuring the biofuel's response to the cold of a 38,000-foot cruising altitude and stopping and restarting the engines in mid-flight, Scott said. Britain's Virgin Atlantic Airways flew a much larger Boeing 747 on a test flight last February using a mix of coconut and babassu oil in one of the plane's four main fuel tanks. And last month, Air New Zealand tested a 747 with one of its engines powered by a blend of conventional jet fuel and jatropha oil. ""What we're starting to see here is even when you combine two of them that haven't been flown before, the performance is equal to or better than traditional jet fuel with no degradation,"" Scott said. He said work on the fuels has been going on for about three years, and biofuel blends could start going into service in three to five years. In a statement announcing the flight, Continental said it would examine the engines to make sure the fuel had ""substantively no different"" effect on them.","Continental Airlines used biofuel mix in 737 jet test flight .

"(CNN) -- The trial is being held under strict security measures. The defendant was transported to the courthouse compound in a military convoy. Because he is a minor, the public is not allowed inside the courtroom in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Only the judge, defense and prosecution attorneys, family members, and a human rights observer are allowed inside. The defendant, known as ""El Ponchis"" (""The Cloak"") is an American citizen who is 14 years old. A video provided to CNN by the Mexican military shows the San Diego native after he was captured near Mexico City in December, as he allegedly was trying to flee. In an on-camera interrogation by Mexican military authorities, the youth admitted to brutally killing people -- the victims all were beheaded. The video shows a military interrogator asking the slim teenager with curly hair several questions. ""How many have you killed?"" he asks. ""Four,"" responds the accused, who seems calm and collected. ""How did you execute them?"" ""I slit their throats."" A YouTube video that circulated last year purportedly showed the teenager beating a man with a two-by-four while the man was tied at the wrists and hanging from the ceiling, as other young people watched. Juan Carlos Castro, a spokesman for the juvenile court holding the trial, says the charges against the teenager go well beyond what he admitted on video. ""This teenager is accused by the state attorney's anti-drug unit of crimes related to drug trafficking -- specifically cocaine and marijuana -- illegal possession of military weapons, and violations against federal organized crime law with the objective of committing kidnappings and aggravated murder,"" Castro said. Raul Diaz Garcia, the state human rights commissioner for Morelos state, where Cuernavaca is located, is attending the trial. Diaz said he had an opportunity to speak with the defendant. ""He seemed coherent and looks clean. He spoke with us without any trouble and was smiling. We told him that we were there in case he had any questions (about his rights),"" Diaz said. ""El Ponchis"" is not the only minor in Mexico allegedly involved with drug cartels. Social media pictures have surfaced in the last year showing teenagers and young men holding high-caliber assault weapons and wearing masks. Six youths were captured in October in a town about 30 miles south of Mexico City. Graffiti in the house where they were hiding linked them to the so-called South Pacific Cartel, a splinter group that formed after cartel leader and drug lord Arturo Beltran Leyva was killed in a shootout with the Mexican military in December of 2009. Veronica Morales, the director of the Mexican Network for the Rights of Children, said that unfortunately this is not an isolated case. ""According to academic studies, around 30,000 children and adolescents are currently involved or may be involved in organized crime,"" Morales says. If found guilty, ""El Ponchis"" faces a sentence of three years in a correctional facility, the maximum allowed under Mexican law because of his age. There will be about 60 witnesses testifying at the trial, which is expected to last about three weeks. A juvenile judge will determine guilt and decide on a sentence after hearing all the testimony and arguments by the prosecution and defense. There is no trial by jury in Mexico. Christian Fragoso, a criminal defense attorney familiar with the case, says that even if prosecutors can prove a long criminal history, they will be restricted by current criminal juvenile law. ""Only those crimes committed after reaching the age of 14 can be taken into account. He cannot be found guilty or sentenced for anything he did before,"" Fragoso says. ""El Ponchis"" has been held at a state correctional facility in Cuernavaca since he was captured last December. CNN's Krupskaia Alis in Mexico City contributed to this report.","In a video, the 14-year-old defendant tells an interrogator he has killed four people .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Taliban is claiming responsibility for an attack Friday on a convoy of U.S. Consulate vehicles in northwest Pakistan, saying it was in retaliation for the killing of Osama bin Laden. A car bomb targeted the vehicles in Peshawar, killing one person and wounding 11 others, police said. The bombing is the latest in a series of attacks in the nation following a raid this month by U.S. commandos that left the al Qaeda leader dead. In a telephone call to CNN, a Taliban spokesman said the remote-controlled car bomb attack was also retaliation over ongoing military operations targeting the militant group. The car bomb, packed with 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of explosives, detonated as the consulate cars passed by in Peshawar, said Liaqat Ali Khan, the police chief. It was unclear whether the vehicles were stationary or moving at the time, he said. The blast killed a motorcycle rider passing by, said Ibrar Khan, a Peshawar police official. The motorcyclist was identified as a local resident, and he was not a suicide bomber, Khan said. But a U.S. Embassy spokesman said it was a suicide bomber, who detonated himself next to one of the two vehicles in the convoy as it was making its way to the consulate. The blast injured two U.S. government employees, said spokesman Alberto Rodriguez. He said the employees suffered minor injuries. Nine others, described as bystanders, were wounded in the blast, Khan said. Peshawar is about 90 miles west of the capital, Islamabad.

"(CNN) -- As Rupert Murdoch and his son took the hot seat Tuesday in the British Parliament, old questions about News Corp.'s business practices were getting fresh scrutiny on the other side of the Atlantic. The fallout of the British phone-hacking scandal has resulted in the arrest of 10 people, including Rebekah Brooks, a former News of the World editor who resigned Friday from her post as chief executive of News International, and the resignation of Les Hinton as CEO of the Dow Jones unit, which publishes The Wall Street Journal. Murdoch's company has suffered a stock plunge, is facing questions over future leadership and is under an FBI investigation. Now, the business ethos of another arm of News Corp. could deepen the controversy and raise eyebrows about the media mogul's entire corporate culture. News America Marketing, an in-store coupon and newspaper ad insert marketing business, has been hauled into U.S. courts several times over unsavory practices that include hacking into the computers of competitors. In one of the lawsuits, New Jersey-based Floorgraphics charged that News America attacked Floorgraphics directly by breaking into a password-protected computer system to acquire sensitive proprietary information, including past and future contracts. The company claimed it had lost several big-name contracts because of News America's tactics. In another lawsuit, rival Valassis described a scene from the movie ""The Untouchables"" in which mobster Al Capone beats an enemy to death with a baseball bat. It said Paul Carlucci, then the chief operating officer of News America, showed the scene to his employees to get his point across: that News America employees will tackle their work with ""unbridled aggression."" ""The selected scene is a perfect metaphor for the business practices both expected and in fact being employed (by News America) to illegally leverage its market dominance,"" Valassis said in its federal lawsuit. In Minnesota, Insignia Systems Inc. filed an anti-trust claim seeking restitution for millions of dollars it said it lost because of the behavior of News America Marketing. In these cases, Murdoch's company attempted to smooth over its problems by settling lawsuits with millions of dollars and, in the case of Floorgraphics, buying out the company. The business news website Bnet described the acquisition as ""more like a face-saving gesture for News America than a real deal."" New York Times media columnist David Carr reported that News America has a history of solving its problems with large sums of money. The company, wrote Carr, ""paid out about $655 million to make embarrassing charges of corporate espionage and anticompetitive behavior go away."" In making his point, Carr quoted Mark Lewis, the lawyer for the family of slain British girl Millie Dowler, whose mobile phone voice mail was hacked into by journalists. ""This is not just about one individual but about the culture of an organization,"" Lewis said after Brooks' resignation. A News America spokeswoman said the company had no comment. The scandal potentially could be far-reaching in America. Besides Dow Jones, News Corp. also is the parent company of Fox News, the New York Post, and Harper Collins publishers in the United States. 9/11 victims . Some Americans have already reacted with outrage and shock after allegations that the phones of victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks were hacked as Millie Dowler's was. ""We are aware of the allegations and are looking into them,"" said a federal law enforcement source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the investigation. ""We'll be looking at anyone acting for or on behalf of News Corp., from the top down to janitors,"" to gather information and determine whether any laws may have been broken,"" the source said. The alleged 9/11 privacy violations appear to be traceable to a story published the Mirror, a British tabloid that publishes a section it calls ""gossip gone toxic."" The newspaper cited a source who referred to a former police officer who now works as a private investigator. The source said the investigator was used by journalists in America and that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims' private phone data. ""Until we get some accountability, they're just going to keep doing it,"" said Jim Riches, a retired Fire Department of New York deputy chief who lost a son in the attacks. ""It's completely unethical, unprofessional and basically criminal. Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, told CNN that ""Congress has important oversight responsibilities"" in responding to the charges and ""getting to the bottom of this evolving scandal."" Reports were also circulating that actor Jude Law, already in the center of the celebrity hacking scandal in Britain, may have a case in the United States. An FBI spokesperson said the agency was ""aware of the media reports"" that Law was hacked in the United States and that News Corp. had settled several lawsuits with American businesses, but said there would be no official comment ""since these matters are under review."" Anti-bribery laws . News Corp. could face trouble in the United States on another front as well. As the parent company of the British newspapers, News Corp. could be prosecuted for possibly breaking federal anti-bribery laws. News of the World, a 168-year-old British newspaper owned by Murdoch, folded in the wake of accusations that its reporters illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims, politicians and celebrities. Police in the United Kingdom have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking. There also were allegations that reporters may have bribed law enforcement officers. Potential liability flows from journalists at News of the World to its parent, News International, and to its parent, News Corp., which is a publicly held company in the United States. Several U.S. lawmakers sent letters to Attorney General Eric Holder asking him to look into concerns that News Corp. violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, known as the FCPA. The law, enacted in 1977, makes it illegal for a U.S. person or company to pay foreign officials to obtain or retain business. In a statement posted on his website, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, said he wants the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission to step in: . ""The limited information already reported in this case raises serious questions about the legality of the conduct of News Corporation and its subsidiaries under the FCPA. Further investigation may reveal that current reports only scratch the surface of the problem at News Corporation. Accordingly, I am requesting that DOJ and the SEC examine these circumstances and determine whether U.S. laws have been violated.""","A News Corp. in-store ad company's practices have led to lawsuits .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Fort Hood shooting suspect Maj. Nidal Hasan has replaced his lead defense attorney, John Galligan, it was revealed Wednesday. Galligan, the former Army lawyer who has been the lead attorney for Hasan since nearly the beginning of the case, was not present at Hasan's arraignment Wednesday at Fort Hood. It is unclear why Galligan was ousted. The judge in the case asked Hasan if he had removed Galligan voluntarily and without outside pressure, and Hasan said, ""Yes."" The only other thing Hasan said in court was the names of his current lawyers: Col. Chris Poppe, Maj. Christopher Martin and Capt. Justin Oshana. Hasan, an Army psychiatrist of Muslim background, is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 others in November 2009. Galligan had fought the Department of Defense for months to make sure his client gets a fair trial. He tried to get the Army to take the possibility of a death sentence off the table. But when Fort Hood Cmdr. Gen. Donald Campbell ordered that Hasan face general court-martial, he also ruled that Hasan would face possible execution if found guilty. Galligan issued a statement referring to his departure as a ""leave of absence,"" but giving no details of why he is leaving the defense team. ""I have consistently argued that Major Hasan has not been treated fairly. I maintain that belief. As such, I deeply regret that my presence on the Defense Team has been interrupted. However, Major Hasan fully understands that I stand ready and anxious to resume an active role."" Galligan also said he and his family have been vilified for defending Hasan. In a telephone interview with CNN, Galligan maintained that he was not fired from the defense team. He was only released and he may be back, he said. However, Galligan would provide no reason for his removal other than to say it had nothing to do with his health or the fact that his family has been attacked. Galligan went on to say there are a lot of issues: ""Stay tuned."" Other than the change of attorneys, the arraignment was formal and quick. Hasan's new lead attorney Poppe said they wished to defer entering a plea or any new motions in the case. Hasan did not have the option of pleading guilty. When a person faces a possible death penalty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the law prohibits a guilty plea. The judge set a trial date of March 5, 2012. Hasan appeared in court in standard-issue Army camouflage fatigues. The rest of the officers involved in the case have been ordered to wear more formal Army dress uniforms during hearings and the trial. He appeared alert during the proceeding, speaking frequently to Poppe. Witnesses at a preliminary hearing have identified Hasan as the man who walked calmly through a medical building on the country's largest military base, shooting and frequently reloading his handgun as he shouted ""Allah Akbar,"" which means ""God is great"" in Arabic. Hasan was shot by Fort Hood police officers and has been paralyzed from the center of his chest down since the attack. He now uses a wheelchair. Aside from protecting Hasan's rights, Galligan has fought to get him proper medical treatment while he awaits trial. For example, it took a lot of time just to get a blanket to keep Hasan warm during hearings in the well-air-conditioned courtroom. When Hasan was brought into court on Wednesday, he had no blanket but was wearing an olive green stocking cap on his bald head. He took it off during the hearing and put it back on just before wheeling himself out of the courtroom.","Suspect arraigned with new head lawyer .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A lapse in Lindsay Lohan's health insurance -- because she's not been working in the past year -- has prevented her from paying for the psychological counseling ordered as part of her probation, her lawyer revealed in court Thursday. ""Maybe she knows somebody who can help out,"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner said, warning Lohan she had 21 days to sign up for counseling. Judge Sautner ordered the actress to appear in court Thursday so she could review the actress' progress on meeting the requirements of her probation for a shoplifting conviction and two older drunk driving convictions. Lohan, 25, entered a guilty plea in May to stealing a necklace from a Venice, California jewelry story. While Lohan is in compliance with her community service, fines and shoplifting counseling requirements, but she has not signed up for the court-ordered psychological counseling, the judge said. She could be ordered to jail unless she proves within three weeks that she has found a psychologist, Sautner said. Group counseling, which probationers attend, is often free or low-cost, but Judge Sautner agreed with Lohan's lawyer, Shawn Holley, that Lohan's celebrity status makes that unworkable. ""I don't want group counseling for her,"" Sautner said. ""She needs one on one counseling."" Lohan scribbled a note to her lawyer during the hearing saying she believed she could raise the cash soon to enter counseling. The judge chided Lohan for only completing 33 of the required 480 hours of community service so far. If it's not finished within a year, she could go to jail, she said. Lindsay Lohan wore these shoes to court?! She must work 120 hours at the Los Angeles County morgue after she completes 360 hours at the a women's center on Los Angeles' Skid Row section. ""Get done with that community service and your life can be back in order,"" Judge Sautner said. Lohan's legal woes, which began four years ago with two drunk driving arrests, have been compounded over the past two years by her failure to attend counseling classes and alcohol and drug test failures. The 120-day jail sentence also ordered translated into just 35 days of home confinement that ended on June 29. Jail overcrowding rules and and state rules that give credit for good behavior for prisoners allowed for the shortened term. Her probation is scheduled to end within a year, unless Lohan is charged with breaking any laws before then. It has been extended several times because of probation violations, including failed alcohol and drug tests. Lohan failed an alcohol test administered by a probation officer in June and was ordered to go before the judge for a probation violation hearing the next week. But Lohan's attorney convinced the judge the testing requirement had lapsed in February. Judge Saunter ruled that Lohan is now allowed to drink alcohol and she is no longer required to take random drug tests. The actress has managed to avoid more than a few days in jail despite two drunken-driving convictions, a long list of probation violations and the recent theft conviction. ""Because of budget constraints and because we're under a federal consent decree that requires us to curb our overcrowding situation, nonviolent offenders, lesser crimes, get 20% of their sentence,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. Lohan entered drug rehab last year to avoid a jail sentence imposed by another judge. But Sautner made it clear in court last month that she didn't think drugs and alcohol were the root of Lohan's legal troubles. ""She's got other problems for which she self-medicates,"" Sautner said at her sentencing in May. Lohan's four years in and out of court -- and sometimes jail -- started with two drunken-driving arrests in 2007. Since then, she's spent more than eight months in substance-abuse rehabilitation programs. A probation report released in May said the actress ""appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues."" ""It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity,"" the probation report said, yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail. Lohan tested positive for alcohol use, a violation of probation rules, in February, the report said. It also revealed that the drug test failure last August, which resulted in a jail sentence and court-ordered rehab, involved cocaine and amphetamines.","NEW: Lohan's SAG insurance expired because of no acting work, her lawyer tells the judge .

"(CNN) -- A demonstration erupted Sunday outside an Iranian detention center, where 33 members of a women's group were being held following their arrest during a peaceful protest in a Tehran park a day before, a human rights organization reported. The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, citing an eyewitness account, said more than 100 police and plainclothes officers broke up a gathering of the Mourning Mothers in Laleh Park on Saturday afternoon. The group, formed by women whose children have been killed in recent anti-government protests, gathers every weekend at the park to call attention to the deaths. ""They would not allow anyone to even sit on the benches or congregate,"" the organization quoted the unidentified witness as saying. ""After about 70 mothers entered the park, security forces engaged them and started chasing them, grabbing them, and forcing them into police vans. They used a lot of violence and insults in the process."" Thirty-three women were taken to the Vozara Detention Center, said Hadi Ghaemi, director of the human rights campaign. Later, nine women were taken to emergency rooms in two hospitals, but all nine were returned to the detention center late Saturday, he said Sunday. Families and other group members went to the detention center Sunday to demand answers to why the women were detained. Officials provided the names of those detained. Those gathered outside the detention center Sunday were alarmed about the health of those inside when an ambulance entered the center, Ghaemi said. The gathering turned into a protest, with people chanting, ""Free the mothers!"" Security forces attacked the crowd to disperse it, Ghaemi said. Two people passing by in a car who took pictures were placed in the detention center, he said. With Iran's tight restrictions on international media, CNN could not independently verify the report. The group's Web site had no details about the reported arrests. ""No culture permits such violence to be unleashed against mothers,"" Ghaemi said in a news release posted on the campaign's Web site. ""How can this government, which claims to have moral and religious authority, treat mothers who have lost their children in such a way? The Iranian officials should know that the activities of Mourning Mothers will not stop until their legitimate grievances are properly addressed."" Mourning Mothers was formed after the violent crackdown on anti-government demonstrators following the disputed June 12 presidential vote, which re-elected hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over main opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi. Since then, opposition activists and mothers whose children have disappeared or have been executed or detained have also joined the group. Among its members is the mother of 26-year-old Neda Agha-Soltan, whose chilling death in post-election protests was caught on video and became a powerful symbol for the opposition. The mothers are demanding government accountability for the deaths, disappearances and detentions of their children.","NEW: Security forces Sunday dispersed crowd protesting women's arrests, group says .

"(CNN) -- An Al-Jazeera cameraman was killed in an apparent ambush near Benghazi, Libya, becoming the first journalist killed in the country since the start of the civil war, the network reported Saturday. Ali Hassan al Jaber was returning to Benghazi, an opposition stronghold in the east, from a nearby town where he had reported on an opposition protest when ""unknown fighters opened fire on a car he and his colleagues were traveling in,"" Al-Jazeera reported on its English-language website. The cameraman and another person were wounded. Al Jaber was rushed to a hospital, but did not survive, the network said. ""Al-Jazeera condemns the cowardly crime, which comes as part of the Libyan regime's malicious campaign targeting Al-Jazeera and its staff,"" the network reported. A civil war has broken out between forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and a tenacious opposition movement. Since the start of the revolt last month, the government has kept a close eye on journalists. Reporters in Tripoli have been given minders and, in some cases, prevented from covering protests. The Committee to Protect Journalists said Friday it has documented more than 40 attacks on the media in Libya since February. They include 25 detentions, four assaults, two attacks on news facilities, the jamming of transmissions, and the interruption of internet service, the New York-based advocacy group said. Several journalists have also reported the confiscation of their equipment, it added. Friday, CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson and his crew were detained in Tajura, Libya, east of Tripoli, by forces loyal to Gadhafi. They were released, though their cabdriver was not. ""We are free to go anywhere, any time, talk to who we want, when we want. That's what Moammar Gadhafi's son told me, that's what Libya told the U.N. We already knew it was all lies -- look at any number of our colleagues arrested, detained, in some cases, beaten -- but today it came home to us personally,"" Robertson wrote. Wadah Khanfar, director-general of Al-Jazeera, said the network ""will not remain silent"" and vowed to hold those responsible for al Jaber's death to account, Al-Jazeera reported. Al Jaber, a Qatari national, was born in 1955 and studied cinematography in Cairo, the network said.","NEW: An advocacy group documents more than 40 recent attacks on the media in Libya .

"Washington (CNN) -- More than 100 people protesting mountain-top removal coal mining were arrested Monday outside the White House for failing to obey an order to disperse, the U.S. Park Service said. All 114 people arrested at the protest against mountain-top mining were later released pending a court date, according to the park service. The protesters, most from the Appalachian coal-mining states, had a permit to gather in front of the White House, but some failed to follow rules set out in the permit, according to a park service spokesman. The protest capped a three-day event called ""Appalachia Rising"" in the nation's capital. Residents of states in the coal mining region -- West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee -- first came together for a weekend conference called ""Voices from the Mountains."" On Monday, organizers said, hundreds of people gathered at Freedom Plaza for a rally and march to the White House, where 114 people staged a sit-in. They were arrested when they refused to move. ""The science is clear, mountaintop removal destroys historic mountain ranges, poisons water supplies and pollutes the air with coal and rock dust,"" said climate scientist James Hansen, who was arrested at the White House. ""Mountaintop removal, providing only a small fraction of our energy, can and should be abolished. The time for half measures and caving in to polluting industries must end."" ""I have talked, begged, debated, written letters to officials, published op-ed pieces in newspapers and lobbied on the state and federal level to end mountaintop removal,"" said Mickey McCoy, former mayor of Inez, Kentucky, who was also arrested.  ""Being arrested? That's such a small price to pay for being heard. My home and people are paying the real price for mountaintop removal. They are dying."" Mountain-top mining refers to a form of coal mining most common in the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States in which the peak or top of a mountain is removed. The resulting degradation of the environment affects water sources such as streams, as well as animal and plant life in the area.","NEW: Civil disobedience act caps weekend conference .

"NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (CNN)  -- J.K. Rowling has retired Harry Potter, but the fictional boy wizard lives in on college classes across the country where the children's books are embraced as literary and academic texts. J.K. Rowling's books are often analyzed in the context of other relevant texts. Drawing on their expertise in theology, children's literature, globalization studies and even the history of witchcraft, professors have been able to use Harry Potter to attract crowds of students eager to take on a disciplined study of the books. Danielle Tumminio, a Yale Divinity School graduate student and the instructor for Yale's Harry Potter course ""Christian Theology and Harry Potter,"" said her academic background in literature and theology, combined with her personal interest in the books, inspired her to design the course. The course uses all seven Potter books and the students examine Christian themes such as sin, evil and resurrection.  Interactive: All about Harry » . ""It was a struggle for me as I put the class together, because I knew if I didn't construct this really well ... that a lot of what I was doing would be missed or misconstrued. I certainly didn't want to come across as someone trying to indoctrinate my students,"" Tumminio said. ""I also wanted to make it clear that it was a critical endeavor, and that it wasn't ... that you'd sit around all day talking about how great Luna Lovegood was."" The class was an immediate draw for students. Seventy-nine people showed up at the first session for the 18 open seats. Although Yale's course is its first Harry Potter-themed offering, other universities, including Georgetown University, Liberty University, Pepperdine University, Stanford University, Lawrence University, Swarthmore and Kansas State University, also have integrated the series into their curricula. Rowling's books are often analyzed in the context of other relevant texts, such as contemporary British fantasy or potential influences, including C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. Philip Nel, author of ""J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter Novels: A Reader's Guide"" and professor of children's literature at Kansas State University, started teaching the books in 2002. ""Harry Potter is unfairly maligned simply because of the audience for which it is intended. Children's literature is literature, and if people don't agree with that definition, it's sort of hard to have a conversation with them,"" Nel said. ""They see things that ... are easily accessible as therefore not serious and therefore not worthy of serious inquiry."" John Granger, author of ""Looking for God in Harry Potter,"" argues that children's literature is the most important because it has the greatest formative impact. ""If you sit down with anybody now, almost of any age, if they are literate, they know Harry Potter. They know these stories,"" Granger said. Among students, there is considerable diversity of opinion as to how the books ought to be read. Cat Terrell, a student in Tumminio's course at Yale, said regardless of whether the books are worthy as literary texts, they have helped enhance her understanding of other academic disciplines, including theology. ""If somebody says this isn't worth a Yale class, I would say if we were just reading the Harry Potter books for their literary merit ... I would probably agree with them. [But] the lens of the Harry Potter books actually makes theology ... easier to understand,"" she said. ""It's amazing how many connections you can draw between the theology that we're reading outside of class and the Harry Potter that we've known for 10 years."" Edmund Kern, author of ""The Wisdom of Harry Potter"" and professor at Lawrence University, was originally attracted to the books based on his training as a historian of early religion, magic and witchcraft. For him, the books' historical impact, rather than their literary context, makes for a more intriguing analysis. ""As a kind of global cultural phenomenon, Harry Potter in a sense is unprecedented. I think movies have been extremely popular around the world, I think that certain music has been extremely popular around the world, but never before has a single literary endeavor caught the attention of so many people,"" Kern said. Erika Slaymaker, a student at Swarthmore where another Potter-themed class is offered, thinks the books hold the most significance as a cultural phenomenon. ""I'm not completely convinced that it is such a fabulous set of deep writing that it deserves to be in the Western canon,"" Slaymaker said. She said she considered taking Swarthmore's class, but ended up going for another first-year seminar called ""Women and Popular Culture."" Regardless of academic arguments, the phenomenon of Harry Potter as a whole continues to elicit awe and wonder. Lisa Lowe, professor of American Studies at Yale, has read all seven books not as a scholar, but as a parent. ""What [Rowling's] really done is come up with a mode of captivating a whole generation: it's a form of captive concentration that took place over a course of nearly 10 years,"" Lowe said. ""As an adult, you'll be thinking, 'What would Harry have done?'"" E-mail to a friend .","Harry Potter is being taught at colleges across the country .

"(CNN) -- ""New Moon,"" the latest film in ""The Twilight Saga"" is doing record business at the box office. In its opening weekend the film grossed $140.7 million -- more than any other film with an autumn release in history. The tales of teenage vampire love based on the best-selling books by Stephanie Meyer have wooed film-goers without having to resort to acres of flesh being on display. This distinct lack of on-screen sex runs contrary to the popular trend of portraying teenagers on screen as playing fast and loose with their virginity and affections. Love and the importance of relationships most definitely rule in ""The Twilight Saga"" and the formula is proving popular with audiences. Elizabeth Morowitz, Communications Professor at the University of Missouri and author of ""Bitten By Twilight"" thinks that this more sensitive approach is the key to the film's success. ""A lot of people ask 'what's so appealing about the Twilight and why is it popular now?' and we think it's because of the relationships and the messages about love in Twilight. In a more conservative environment we've had this push for abstinence education, so we now have a media message that's more congruent with that. So perhaps some teens relate to it in that way,"" Morowitz told CNN's Katie Walmsley. The director of ""New Moon"" Chris Weitz says that sexual abstinence is central to the film's appeal. ""It's not that they can't have sex, they choose not to and I think there's so much popular culture that's saying to young people: 'you'll be cool if you have sex' or 'it's important to be sexy' whereas this series really concentrates on matters of the heart and spirit and I think that's lovely,"" Weitz told CNN. A dashing male lead, in the shape of Robert Pattison doesn't hurt either when you're trying to attract a female teenage audience.

"(CNN)  -- The Tennis Channel has canceled plans to broadcast a tournament in Dubai because an Israeli player was banned. Israeli tennis player Shahar Peer was denied a visa by the United Arab Emirates. Shahar Peer, the 45th-ranked women's player according to the World Tennis Association, qualified to compete in this week's Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships but was denied a visa by the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is one of the seven emirates of the UAE. The cable network had planned to air parts of the tournament this weekend. ""Tennis Channel recognizes that this exclusion has been made by state authorities and neither the tour nor tournament directors themselves,"" said a statement posted on the channel's Web site Wednesday. ""However we also honor the role and proud tradition that tennis has always played as a driving force for inclusion both on and off the courts. ""Preventing an otherwise qualified athlete from competing on the basis of anything other than merit has no place in tennis or any other sport, and has the unfortunate result of undermining the credibility of the very nature of competition itself."" The announcement comes the same day The Wall Street Journal Europe announced it is dropping its sponsorship of the tournament. ""The Wall Street Journal's editorial philosophy is free markets and free people, and this action runs counter to the Journal's editorial direction,"" the Journal said in a written statement. The paper also said it plans to cancel a special tennis-themed advertising section scheduled for Monday and its backing of a men's tournament in Dubai scheduled for next week. After days of international criticism, including the WTA saying it would review whether the UAE should be allowed to host future tournaments, the event's organizers said Peer was barred from the tournament for her own protection, apparently alluding to Israel's recent military offensive in Gaza. ""We do not wish to politicize sports, but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the region and not alienate or put at risk the players and the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have here,"" organizers said in a written statement. The statement cited anti-Israel protests before one of Peer's matches at a recent tournament in New Zealand. But this is not the first time the UAE has barred Israeli tennis players. Last year, an Israeli men's doubles team was denied entry. The emirate also cited security concerns then. In a statement posted on the Tennis Channel's site, Peer thanked the cable channel for its decision. ""I was very moved and excited to hear about your decision not to broadcast the Dubai tournament following their denial to allow me to participate in the event,"" she wrote. ""You at Tennis Channel were the first ones to add action to the words and this is leading the way to other organizations as well. ""All I want is to play tennis and do well. I believe you are helping me to do exactly this.""","United Arab Emirates denies visa to Israeli tennis player Shahar Peer .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts woman convicted of attempted murder after failing to properly care for her cancer-stricken son was sentenced Friday to spend eight to 10 years in prison, prosecutors said. Kristen LaBrie, 38, also was ordered to serve five years on probation and to complete an anger management program, said Essex County district attorney spokesman Steve O'Connell. Prosecutors argued during LaBrie's trial that she intentionally withheld medications and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy, from her son, Jeremy Fraser. Fraser, an autistic child who at age 6 was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was recuperating and his cancer was in remission. But in 2009 he died of leukemia. He was 9 years old. Prosecutors argued that LaBrie's negligence was a factor that contributed to her son's death, allowing the cancer to spread after it had been beaten back into remission. LaBrie had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the crime. She will be eligible for parole after eight years, O'Connell said. She was sentenced to probation for convictions of child endangerment and assault and battery. LaBrie's attorney said earlier that the system failed his client. ""Some of the times when people have mental problems they have a hard time reaching out. That's the purpose of social workers. Social workers are supposed to be able to detect when people have problems. The social workers on this case failed to do that.

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- A radio station in Mexico has aired parts of a telephone conversation it alleges took place between a top drug lord and a federal congressman. In the recording, voices the station identify as those of lawmaker Cesar Godoy and Servando Gomez -- also known as ""La Tuta,"" leader of the La Familia cartel -- express support for one another and discuss a wide range of topics including upcoming elections and a local reporter stirring up stories. The tape has renewed concerns about corruption in a country struggling to subdue its powerful drug cartels. More than 28,000 people have died in drug violence in Mexico since 2006, according to authorities. W Radio says the conversation took place more than a year ago and was collected as part of an investigation into Godoy's suspected cartel ties. The station did not disclose its source for the tape. An official at the Mexican Attorney General's Office confirmed the recordings represent the real voices of Godoy and Gomez, but declined further comment. ""First of all, I want you to win. You have total support. You will win,"" the voice identified as Gomez' says in a conversation broadcast by W Radio. The two male voices are heard talking about possible informants and a journalist who is said to be causing the congressman trouble. Toward the end of the recording, the voice identified as Godoy's warns his friend: ""Much care must be taken. This thing is heating up."" Godoy, who represents the state of Michoacan, already faces federal charges for allegedly helping the cartel, which is active in his area. He currently has immunity from arrest because of his status as a lawmaker, but he could lose that. On Thursday, Godoy responded to the recordings, calling them part of a broad smear campaign. Godoy, who was elected last year, failed to appear Friday at a congressional committee hearing meant to address his alleged cartel ties. He sent word his mother was ill and is now expected to appear Monday. Thursday, he spoke briefly to reporters. He never specifically denied the voice in the recording was his. Godoy accused the government of leaking the tapes to discredit him. As it cannot prove its case against him in court, the government will try to win it politically, Godoy said.

"(CNN) -- San Francisco police are saying  a man they thought was fatally shot by officers actually killed himself. Police earlier said Kenneth Harding was shot by an officer Saturday while trying to run away. But on Thursday, authorities said they found evidence that proved something different. ""We believe that the  fatal wound on Mr. Harding was self-inflicted,"" said police Cmdr.  Mike Biel. Biel revealed the new theory at a news conference Thursday at the city's medical examiner's office. Kenneth Harding died Saturday after a confrontation with undercover  officers who were doing a fare check on passengers on the city's Muni bus transit  system. Police say when he was approached by the officer who wanted to see his ticket, Harding ran and police pursued him. During the chase, a gunbattle started  and Harding was fatally wounded, . Initially, authorities  believed that San Francisco police shot and killed Harding during the  confrontation in the city' Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood. The shooting triggered angry protests by some community members who challenged the police version of  what happened. The medical examiner said new evidence reveals a different story. ""The bullet which was recovered from  his head is not consistent with the service ammunition used by the San Francisco  Police Department,"" Chief Medical Examiner Amy Hart told reporters. She  demonstrated her point with a photo of the bullet removed from Harding's head. It was a .380-caliber and San Francisco Police are armed with .40-caliber ammunition, Hart said. Medical examiner's staff also found a second, unfired cartridge  (.380-caliber) in Harding's right jacket pocket. Harding was also  wounded in the leg by a round  apparently fired by pursuing  officers, authorities said. ""Based upon evidence known at this time including:  officer and witness statements that Harding shot at the police officers, Shot  Spotter data, video tape evidence that depicts a firearm at the scene that was  subsequently taken and the location of gunshot residue on Harding's right hand,  it appears that Mr. Harding's head wound was self-inflicted.  It is unknown if  Harding's injury was intentional or accidental."" When the shooting occurred, a crowd  had gathered challenging officers, police said in a statement released at the news  conference. At one point, a bystander recorded cell phone  video of the situation, including a handgun that was laying on the ground near  Harding. The Police Department believes that  the weapon used by Harding is still outstanding along with a cell phone and  bullet casings removed from the scene. Authorities are offering a $1,000 reward for the return of the .380-caliber firearm picked up  from the scene. Harding was listed as ""a person of  interest"" by Seattle Police who were investigating the shooting death of a  young woman in that city a few weeks ago, CNN affiliate KGO reported.","The fatal shooting occurs in San Francisco .

"(CNN) -- A heat wave blamed for as many as two dozen deaths settled over portions of the East Coast as the National Weather Service issued an extreme heat warning for much of the Mid-Atlantic, saying Friday would be the hottest day in the region. The highest heat index values -- how hot it feels -- could reach 115 degrees in some locations, the weather service said. ""These triple-digit temperatures are forecast to remain in place across the eastern U.S. through Saturday,"" it said. How hot is it where you live? Share your photos, videos and stories . The weather was expected to cool slightly to the mid-90s by Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. The warnings came as the heat wave set 55 record highs and tied 60 more records in portions of the Midwest and the Ohio Valley, forecasters said. Millions were also being warned to avoid strenuous activity and exercise outdoors after the National Weather Service issued a number of code red air quality alerts -- meaning air pollution levels are considered unhealthy for the general population -- in a handful of cities, including Baltimore and Washington. Beat-the-heat advice from a pro . The heat has affected many outdoor activities, prompting one Minneapolis movie theater marquee to read, ""We have AC. Who cares what's playing,"" and one Canadian couple to forgo their original plans while visiting the Twin Cities. Scott Hoffort and his wife, Colleen, of Saskatchewan arrived in Minneapolis on Sunday with their camping gear, planning for a vacation spent mostly outdoors at a campground. Instead they're now doing ""more touristy"" things. ""We went from camping in a tent to staying in hotels so that we could get air conditioning,"" Hoffort said. ""We spent a fair amount of time in the Mall of America yesterday because of the heat."" Heat hurts your insides too . About 100 people, primarily teenagers, were overcome Thursday by the heat at the Vans Warped Tour in Camden, New Jersey, where more than 12,000 people gathered at the outdoor concert, authorities said. ""I just, I guess got overheated and I got really dizzy,"" 17-year-old Maureen Meckly, who attended the concert, told CNN affiliate KYW. ""I had to grab onto her (friends') shoulder to tell her I was passing out."" In Wildwood, New Jersey, tourists and residents beat the heat by heading to the ocean. What a heatstroke feels like . But for some working hot food concession stands at Morey's Piers in Wildwood there was little relief. ""Sometimes it's so hot, I can't even breathe,"" Erik Perez, who works at Curley's Fries, told KYW. In Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Cory Booker announced that facilities were available in every ward to help keep citizens cool. ""It is imperative that our residents drink plenty of fluids, stay indoors in a cool climate, and avoid strenuous activity,"" Booker said in a statement. ""I urge our senior citizens and Newark residents who lack air conditioning to come to one of our cooling centers."" In New York, Con Edison called on customers to stay cool and not waste energy. ""Store owners who leave doors open with the A/C running could be subject to fines from the city,"" ConEd said. The first confirmed heat-related death in Kansas City was declared Thursday, but it stemmed from a death last month. A 57-year-old man was found dead in his home June 5, according to Dan Ferguson, who works for Jackson County. In addition to the man's death, there are 13 other possible heat-related deaths in Missouri: the youngest was a woman in her mid-30s and the oldest were two women in their mid-70s, said Jeff Hershberger, spokesman for the Kansas City Health Department. It may take six weeks to several months for officials to process toxicology tests to determine whether all 13 died of heat-related causes, Hershberger said. In Wisconsin, a 65-year-old man from Fountain Prairie was confirmed by health officials to have died from heat-related causes Thursday, according to CNN affiliate WKOW. Columbia County Medical Examiner Angela Hinze said the man had underlying medical conditions that were made worse when he was helping a family member outside with housework. In Oklahoma, four heat-related deaths have been confirmed since May, said Cherokee Ballard, a spokeswoman for the state medical examiner. Three of those occurred in the past 30 days, including a 3-year-old boy in a car in Norman and a 69-year-old man from Blackwell, she said. An additional eight Oklahoma deaths may be related to the heat, she said, with most occurring in July. CNN affiliate WPXI reported Thursday that a child accidentally locked in a hot car was rescued in Spring Hill, Pennsylvania. The girl's mother locked her keys in the car and immediately called for help, the report said. The girl was not hurt. The high heat is also taking its toll on animals. In South Dakota, 1,500 head of livestock have been lost to the heat, Larry Olsen of the Farm Service Agency told CNN affiliate KSFY. Dozens of cattle died south of Harmony, Minnesota, CNN affiliate KTTC reported. And on a cattle farm just across the border in northern Iowa, an estimated 100 cattle died, the report said. At the Brookfield Zoo just outside Chicago, staff kept water misters in exhibits and gave some animals huge blocks of ice filled with meat and fruit.

"(CNN) -- An 11-year-old California girl snatched from the street in front of her house in 1991 had two children with the man accused of taking her and was forced along with the children to live in backyard sheds, police said Thursday. Jaycee Lee Dugard as she looked in 1991 and an age-progression image of what she might look like as an adult. ""From what they have both said, he fathered both of those children with Jaycee [Dugard],"" El Dorado County Undersheriff Fred Kollar told reporters. The girls, now 11 and 15, had been living with their mother, now 29, in a series of sheds behind Phillip Garrido's house in Antioch, California, until they were discovered on Wednesday, Kollar said. ""None of the children had ever gone to school, they had never been to a doctor, they were kept in complete isolation in this compound, if you will, at the rear of the house,"" he said. ""They were born there."" In a rambling telephone interview from jail, Garrido told CNN affiliate KCRA of Sacramento he was relieved at being caught. ""I feel much better now,"" he said. ""This is a process that needed to take place."" Kollar said Garrido's wife, Nancy, was with her husband when Dugard was abducted from the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe. Garrido was already a registered sex offender at the time.  Watch police talk about why they arrested Garrido » . ""There was nothing then nor is there anything now to indicate that this was anything other than a stranger abduction of an 11-year-old,"" Kollar said. The investigation went years without apparent progress until Tuesday, when Garrido showed up on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley with his two daughters and attempted to get permission to hand out literature and speak, Kollar said. He did not know the subject of either the literature or the planned talk. Police officers ""thought the interaction between the older male and the two young females was rather suspicious,"" so she confronted them and performed a background check on him, Kollar said. That check revealed that Garrido was on federal parole for a 1971 conviction for rape and kidnapping, for which he had served time in the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. A school spokesman identified the officers as Allison Jacobs and Lisa Campbell, and said the two became suspicious of ""subtle behavior"" Garrido exhibited. They passed on the information to Garrido's parole officer, who requested that the 58-year-old man appear Wednesday at the parole office. Garrido did just that, accompanied by his wife, Nancy, ""and a female named Allissa,"" Kollar said. The presence of ""Allissa"" and the two children surprised the parole officer, who had never seen them during visits to Garrido's house, Kollar said. ""Ultimately, Allissa was identified as Dugard,"" Kollar said. DNA confirmation is being sought to confirm her identity, but Dugard revealed information during an interview that only she could have known, Kollar said. ""The two minor children turned out to be children of Jaycee and the male suspect, Garrido,"" he said. Scott Kernan, undersecretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, told reporters that Garrido admitted to having abducted Dugard. El Dorado County Sheriff's Office online records showed that Phillip and Nancy Garrido were in the county jail, held on suspicion of offenses including conspiracy to commit a crime and kidnapping with the intent to commit robbery and rape. Dugard had been living behind Garrido's home since she was kidnapped, Kollar said. But her presence there apparently went unnoticed by others in the residential neighborhood, where homes on one-fourth to one-half-acre lots typically sell for less than $200,000, said Kathy Russo, whose father has lived two houses away from the Garridos for 33 years. ""My dad said he never saw a young woman,"" said Russo, who added that her father, 94-year-old Dante Confetti, considered Garrido to be a ""kind of strange, reclusive, kind of an angry kind of guy."" She said the one-story house's backyard was obscured by trees and ringed by a wooden fence. Her family's last contact with Garrido was last fall, she said. ""He was burning something in the backyard and my home health aide called the fire department,"" Russo said. ""He was really pissed off,"" she said. ""Came over to the house and started yelling."" Garrido told KCRA that he left documents three days ago with the FBI in San Francisco, California, that would shed light on the case. ""They're going to be a part of the trial,"" he said. A call from CNN to the FBI's San Francisco bureau was not immediately returned. Garrido said he could not go into detail about why he chose to abduct Dugard. ""I haven't talked to a lawyer yet, so I can't do that,"" he said. But Garrido said he had ""completely turned my life around"" in the past several years. ""You're going to find the most powerful story coming from the witness, from the victim,"" he said. ""If you take this a step at a time, you're going to fall over backward and in the end you're going to find the most powerful, heartwarming story."" He added, ""Wait 'til you hear the story of what took place at this house. You're going to be absolutely impressed. It's a disgusting thing that took place with me in the beginning, but I turned my life completely around."" Describing the two daughters, he said, ""Those two girls slept in my arms every single night from birth; I never kissed them."" But in a later comment, he said that, from the time the youngest was born, ""everything turned around."" Asked about the fact that they had not seen doctors, he said, ""We just didn't have the finances and so forth."" Kollar said a search of Garrido's property ""revealed a hidden backyard within a backyard,"" he said. It included several sheds no higher than 6 feet tall, two tents and several outbuildings ""where Jaycee and the girls spent most of their lives."" The ""secondary"" backyard was inside the first and was ""screened from view."" One of the sheds was soundproof, he said. ""The way the backyard is set up you could walk through the backyard, walk through the house and never know that there was another set of living circumstances in that backyard."" At the end of the backyard is a 6-foot fence lined with shrubs, tall trees, garbage bags and a tarp, all of which obscured views of what was there, he said. Extension cords provided electricity to the sheds and tents, and an outhouse and rudimentary shower ""as if you were camping"" were there, too, he said. Dugard ""was in good health, but living in a backyard for the past 18 years does take its toll,"" Kollar said. He described her as ""relatively cooperative, relatively forthcoming"" in discussions with detectives. He said Dugard was ""in relatively good condition,"" neither obviously abused nor malnourished. He added, ""There are no known attempts by her to outreach to anybody."" The mother and her two daughters were staying at a motel in the area, he said. ""Family reunification has begun and will be a long and ongoing process,"" he said, presumably referring to Dugard's parents. Earlier Thursday, Carl Probyn, Dugard's stepfather, told CNN that an FBI agent had called his wife, Terry, on Wednesday afternoon to tell her that Dugard had been found. ""Jaycee remembers everything,"" he said. ""They talked back and forth and she had the right answers to all my wife's questions."" He said, ""I'm feeling great! ... It's like winning the Lotto."" He witnessed the abduction of the blond, blue-eyed girl, who was wearing a pink windbreaker and pink stretch pants as she walked to her bus stop on June 10, 1991.  Watch the stepfather describe finding out Jaycee is alive » . At the time, ""It was reported that a vehicle occupied by two individuals drove up to Jaycee Dugard and abducted her in view of her stepfather,"" the El Dorado County Sheriff's office said Thursday. Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said the reappearance of Dugard is ""absolutely huge."" ""One of the things that we preach to searching families all the time ... is that even in these long-term cases there's hope,"" he said. ""Even in these long-term cases ... it's important that we not let the world forget.""

"(CNN) -- China reassured its neighbors Sunday that it will maintain ""peace and stability"" in the turbulent South China Sea, a day after the U.S. renewed concerns over territorial disputes. Defense Minister Gen. Liang Guanglie said China was keeping its agreements to the peaceful resolution of territorial disputes. However, Liang underscored the ""freedom of navigation and overflight"" in the South China Sea. Chinese military has been accused of harassment in the waters recently. The area rich in oil deposits is rife with territorial disputes with claims by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. It's considered to be one of Asia's more dangerous potential flashpoints. Liang said China is no threat to world peace, noting its military policy is purely defensive. ""To judge whether a country is a threat to world peace,"" he said, ""the key is not to look at how strong its economy or military is, but the policy it pursues."" He sought to relieve concerns about China's modernization of its powerful military, saying ""no matter how developed it may be, China will never seek hegemony or military expansion."" Vietnamese defense minister, Gen. Phung Quang Thanh, reiterated calls for the conclusion of a code of conduct between the regional organization ASEAN and China to help restrain disputes in the South China Sea. In his speech, Thanh recounted a May 26 incident when surveying cables of a Vietnamese oil exploration vessel were cut. Vietnam has handled the incident with ""patience,"" he said, adding that they ""expect no repetition of similar incidents."" Philippine President Benigno Aquino said last month that the disputes in the South China Sea could spur a regional arms race. The Philippines accused China of intimidation in disputed oil-rich Spratly islands in the South China Sea, where its oil exploration ship was confronted by Chinese ships in March. The U.S has expressed concern about the potential for clashes in the region. In 2010, China was angered when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for peaceful resolution of the competing claims, saying it was in the U.S. ""national interest.""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A coalition operation against militants in southeastern Afghanistan has left at least 50 insurgents dead as Afghan and NATO forces swept through a ""known Haqqani network"" area. The encampment was considered a staging ground for Haqqani and foreign fighters, NATO's International Security Assistance Force reported Friday. The Haqqani network is an insurgent group loosely affiliated with the Taliban, and is believed to be based in Pakistan's lawless frontier territories. They operate along the porous Afghan-Pakistan border regions. The group has been responsible for ""several high-profile attacks against the Afghan government and its citizens,"" ISAF reported. The coalition operation -- which included Afghan special forces -- engaged ""multiple groups of insurgents,"" who were armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and heavy machine guns. The firefight took place against multiple insurgent groups, who were holed up in areas that included caves and fortified bunker positions, ISAF reported. The operation spanned night-time hours as NATO airstrikes pummeled insurgent positions.","A coalition operation against militants leaves at least 50 insurgents dead .

"(CNN) -- Police and neighbors were searching for three young Michigan boys Saturday who have been missing since their father claimed he dropped them off with a woman before trying to kill himself a day earlier. The father survived his suicide attempt and is being cared for in a mental health facility, said Morenci, Michigan, Police Chief Larry Weeks on Saturday. But Michigan authorities do not know what has happened to his boys -- 5-year-old Tanner Skelton, 7-year-old Alexander William Skelton and 9-year-old Andrew Skelton -- prompting them to issue an Amber Alert on Friday. Weeks said that the boys' father, John Skelton, told police that he dropped the boys off Friday morning with a woman he identified as Joann Taylor -- in part to ensure they didn't see him while and after he tried to commit suicide. John Skelton told police that the woman, whom he allegedly met on the internet, was supposed to drop the boys off at their home in Morenci, a southern Michigan town of about 2,400 people about 40 miles west-northwest of Toledo, around 3 p.m. Friday. But the boys never went home and, Weeks added, authorities still aren't sure if John Skelton's story -- including Joann Taylor's existence -- is true or a fabrication. ""We have not been able to locate a Joann Taylor or confirm that she even exists,"" Weeks told reporters Saturday evening. The last non-family member saw the boys at 5 p.m. on Thursday, according to the chief. Their mother, Tanya, has been with police ""virtually the entire day"" on Saturday, answering questions and serving as what Weeks called a ""valuable resource at this time."" Weeks said Tanya Skelton had ""contact with someone alleging to be Joann,"" adding only that this communication was not necessarily by phone or in person. According to the Amber Alert, Taylor may have been from Jackson or Hillsdale counties and may be driving a silver van. Still, Weeks reiterated that they have yet to confirm she is real and, if so, if she is with the boys. Saturday's press conference was crowded with media and residents of Morenci, many of whom have been searching for the young boys. Dozens spent Saturday searching along Bean Creek, Wakefield Park and the Riverside Natural Area -- all in Morenci -- according to Toledo-based CNN affiliate WUPW. ""We just hope they're somewhere safe and warm playing video games,"" volunteer Carol Garcia told WUPW. But authorities thus far have offered few tips pointing community members to places where the young Skeltons might be. ""We understand their drive and desire to be out there,"" said Weeks. ""The fact is, I cannot tell the community there's a specific location they should be searching."" The alert notes that Tanner is 3 feet, 6 inches tall, has strawberry blond hair, has blue eyes and weighs about 40 pounds. Alexander is 3 feet, 9 inches tall, has brown hair and eyes, weighs about 45 pounds and has scars on his hairline and chin. The oldest brother, Andrew, is 4 feet, 1 inch tall, has brown hair and eyes and weighs roughly 57 pounds.","NEW: Dozens have searched for three missing boys along Michigan-Ohio border .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Way back in 1888, Kodak popularized the hobby of snapshot photography with its famous slogan: ""You press the button, we do the rest."" Zink paper is  is dry, waterproof, smudge-proof, tear-proof, peel-off, sticky-backed -- and recyclable. Now, 120 years later, Zink says: ""Just add paper"" and do it yourself. Zink is a zero-ink printing company that has updated the instant gratification that comes from developing pictures for the digital age. The pleasure of snapping a picture and admiring the print hasn't changed, but the technology has, plus there is a new eco-friendly element. Zink paper is an advanced composite material with embedded yellow, magenta and cyan dye crystals that change color when heated. For a 2""x3"" print, a Zink-enabled printer uses 200 million heat pulses to activate and colorize 100 billion crystals, in 30 seconds, in a single pass. The final result is a photographically correct print that is not only completely dry, but also waterproof, smudge-proof, tear-proof, peel-off and sticky-backed -- not to mention recyclable. If Zink's thermal printing process sounds familiar, it differs from D2T2 (dye diffusion thermal transfer), or dye sublimation technology, used by other companies such as Kodak, Canon or Sony, in one crucial aspect -- Zink involves zero ink. ""The source of heat conveyed to the printer head is similar,"" says Steve Herchen, one of Zink's original inventors and present chief technology officer. ""The advantage with Zink is that there is no need for an ink ribbon. The heat is applied directly to the paper. There are no gears, no motors, no mechanism is required to manage the ink ribbon. All the information is in the paper."" Inkless footprint . So not only is Zink compact, it's ecological. Because there is no ink, there are no empty ink-ribbon cartridges and no extra packaging to dispose of. ""The paper is the print,"" concludes Herchen. ""Printers can be the smallest footprint of any printing technology."" As the company's first consumer application to hit the market, the Zink-enabled Polaroid Instant Mobile Printer is only slightly bigger than an iPhone, weighs 230 grams, uses a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, and connects to a mobile phone via wireless Bluetooth or to a digital camera through a USB cable. The pocket printer will be available later this summer in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Russia, and will sell for about $150, while Zink paper will be sold in packs of 10 or 30, at 33-40 cents per sheet. With sales of camera phones and digital cameras growing exponentially, one can easily speculate about hundreds of billions of digital photos being snapped and ""trapped"" on memory cards and hard drives around the world. But hold on a nanosec -- Why print to paper at all when we inhabit the global digisphere? You know you want to . ""Our research shows that in this digital age, more than ever, people still have a deep-rooted need to see, feel, mark, share or use their digital images or information in a physical form,"" remarks Scott Wicker, Zink's chief marketing officer. ""We know there's a pent-up need to print,"" confides Herchen, a 30-year Polaroid veteran. ""Even though not everyone wants to print every image, there is still a real customer need to be able to print on-the-go, whenever you want, wirelessly, from portable devices."" So far, Zink has partnered with Polaroid and manufacturer Alps Electric to produce the Instant Mobile Printer, and with toy-maker TakaraTomy and manufacturer Foxconn for an upcoming product. In addition, Zink has produced its own not-yet-released 6-megapixel digital camera-printer. If the combo-device doesn't appeal immediately to all die-hard digerati, it might be more likely to win over Polaroid Instamatic nostalgics, or anyone keen on wallet-sized snaps and Japanese-style ""purikura"" photo-sticker booths. Commemorating those Kodak moments . Twenty-five-year-old student Caroline enjoys printing out those special shots for her scrapbook or making collages for friends, and she is happy to pick them up from the self-service kiosk after a short wait. ""I like to physically hold the prints and look at them in my hands,"" she says. ""You appreciate a photo more when it's not on the computer. It's one that you've taken the trouble to print, maybe even frame, so you pay more attention."" If one person's print is that same person's carbon footprint, most people seem to agree that printing remains an inalienable delight. Andy, of the Photo 2000 express kiosk in Hong Kong, confirms: ""About half of the people out there prefer to view their pictures printed, rather than on a computer. But all people like to see real photos. All our customers print photos for friends and family, never for business... If they don't want to print, then we close."" Whether instant or not, at least now zero-ink provides us with an environment-friendly alternative to satisfy our pent-up printing desires.","Zink technology is a thermal printing process on paper that involves zero ink .
Because it uses no ink-ribbon cartridge, it is ultra-compact and ecological .

"(CNN) -- Carefully constructed looks that borrow from another time are all the rage on the streets of St. Paul and Minneapolis. But with vintage and thrift clothing stores popping up on every corner, the vintage look of the Twin Cities almost can't be helped. Since 2006, Minneapoline blogger Ellen Lawson has been documenting the evolving street style in her hometown. She has watched the neighboring cities shed a DIY-esque style and celebrate the rise of local designers. After moving back to Minneapolis once she finished college in Iowa, Lawson found her style evolving as well. ""The blog was really bare bones at first,"" Lawson said. ""I had a point-and-shoot camera, and took photos of everything. I think I'm a little more edited now. I have a grasp of my own personal style. Dressing up in Dallas . ""There's a difference between 25 and 31, as well,"" Lawson said with a laugh, referring to her age. The individualism in the Twin Cities challenges Lawson to capture as much of it as she can. Feminine lace and crochet meet up with menswear and masculine footwear to create a mash-up of different styles. ""We are a really interesting, creative city,"" Lawson said. ""I don't think a lot of people know that."" Below, Lawson describes the basis for Twin Cities style. CNN: What was the 2006 fashion scene in Minneapolis like when you started the blog? Lawson: I had noticed around that time the local fashion scene was picking up -- a lot of local designers and more fashion shows popping up. People thought more about what they were wearing. They were evolving from a DIY aesthetic to more of a regular fashion aesthetic. Colorful layers of style on Chicago's streets . We kept that grassroots feeling at the base of how we evolved, but now it's kind of a hodge-podge. CNN: How would you compare the style now? Lawson: I think people are really budget-conscious here, so thrifting is big. There are so many styles, but it's largely 'budget-friendly creative'. We're just getting to be more open to paying high-fashion prices, but it's a little hard for a lot of people here to get their minds around it. But they're creative, and always carry a retro element. We do have a big hipster contingent in the city, so that affects the style. The high-waist/accentuated waist has been very popular and it goes back to the retro feel of Minneapolis. When you have a lot of people thrifting, you're going to end up having clothes from another time. CNN: Is the local designer scene still alive and well? Lawson: I just found out one of our local designers is going to be on Project Runway. We've had five people from the city in Project Runway. We also have a big fashion show each spring called Voltage. It's a runway show mixed with a rock concert. And then we have MNFashion, a collective support group for local designers.

"(CNN) -- In an exclusive interview with CNN's Matthew Chance, Citibank CEO Vikram Pandit has said the beleaguered bank, which has received $45 billion in bailout money from the U.S. government, is on its way to financial recovery. Pandit: ""We've made a lot of progress in a very short period of time."" MC: Vikrim Pandit, you've been named as one of the worst CEOs in America. There are calls for your resignation from Citi Group. Have you considered stepping down? VP: I have a job to do and I haven't finished it. I'm going to keep doing the job. You know, we've gone through enormous change at Citi. The management team was brought in during the crisis to clean up what happened with the crisis. And, the leadership team, our people have done a wonderful job, we've made a lot of progress in a very short period of time. We have restored financial strength, we have restructured Citi, there's still more work to do but we have a clear strategy, and a clear focus on the future. I keep going back to how much we've accomplished in a very short period of time but really, all the credit goes to our people. MC: But there have been such massive investor losses at Citi bank, losses which you did not anticipate. Shouldn't you be held ultimately accountable for that? VP: I came into the job and from day one I've held myself accountable for restoring Citi to its right place. I've held myself accountable for getting Citi through this economy, through the crisis that we're in. Unfortunately, a lot of us inherited a lot of things. The new management team...came in with a lot of assets particularly focused on the U.S. consumer. And these are losses that we've had to take but we've also made a lot of progress. We've cut our cost structure by twenty-five percent, we've reduced our balance sheet also by about twenty-five percent. Our riskiest assets have been sold for a lot more than that. We've sold businesses, refocused the company and in the first quarter we did show a modest profit. MC: But there's already word that federal authorities in the United States are putting out their feelers, looking for possible successors to your position. Do you believe that you still have the full confidence of the U.S. government, which after all, is now a major shareholder in Citi Group? VP: You know speculation is only natural when we've had the kind of losses that you've talked about and until we've had sustainable profitability, that doesn't make it right. The most important part is that this management team and leadership team was brought in to address the issues at Citi and our people have done a wonderful job. What really counts is the confidence our people, our clients and our regulators around the world, including our primary regulators, have in the leadership of the company...and the strategy that's being laid out in order to restore Citi to its pre-eminence. MC: Let's talk a little about that strategy and for instance, the money for the past year or so that Citi Group has taken -- billions of dollars, tens of billions of dollars in tax payer's money as a bail out. When will that money be given back? Can it ever be repaid? VP: The government invested $45 billion in Citi. It has invested that amount in at least one other bank, it's invested a lot of money into a lot of banks. All due to what happened in the financial markets, post-Lehman brothers disappearing, and the lack of confidence that created. We, and I'm sure others are, thankful for the help we received and our goal is very clear, our goal is to repay every dollar as fast as we can with a great rate of return. MC: What about the fact the government holds such a high percentage of stock? Do you see that as a long term situation or do you think that sometime in the future, very near, when the government will cease to become the major shareholder? VP: A lot of extraordinary things have happened in this extraordinary market. Nobody, nobody believes that we've gone through something that is normal, by any means. The government ownership stake is a result of our converting preferred stock, investment of the government and the common stock. The goal is very straightforward, the goal is to manage the company, to sustain profitability, create a rate of return, so that we can repay the government with a great rate of return and thank the taxpayer for the support that we receive. MC: As a result of this crisis there have been calls for greater regulation in the financial services industry. Do you think it is now inevitable? VP: There is no question this has been an issue for governments through this entire crisis. And it is about the fact there was a large shadow banking system in the U.S. that was mostly not regulated, as an example, although that's not the only example. I do think for capital markets to work well we need good governance and good governance is not always about good regulation. Good governance goes up and down every organization. It's really about how countries come together to work together, so actually I'm looking forward to an environment where the governance structure is stronger than the ones we've gone through. MC: Is there a fundamental problem with the ethics in this business? Has the pursuit of profit gone too far? VP: It's all back to governance isn't it? And standards are part of governance as well and so when you think about the overall aspects of the government structure for the future, the market architecture for the national system for the future, you've got to keep coming back. You have to take a look at all of it. You have to look at it right from the fact that certain central banks didn't think financial stability was part of its mandate all the way through. What are the right incentives? And how do you think about compensating people? We have to look at all of that -- and we are. I must say that we've weathered the debate that we've seen. We are getting at the answers, but most importantly we are making sure that all the right questions are getting asked. MC: So what specific measures would you suggest to try and fix some of these problems that have occurred in the financial industry? VP: There are a lot of suggestions that have already been made. As a matter of fact we were the ones talking about how transparency is important. You have to attack market structure correctly, clearing houses, exchanges, have to have level playing fields on capital, accounting around the world. It's important to understand that I'm happy to have my 136 regulators around the world but we also need one overarching regulator, a systemic regulator that can actually help us and help the system aggregate what's going on. There are suggestions that are not original necessarily. We may have been one of the first ones to talk about them but those are generally the sort of answers people are looking at and more importantly I think we need to debate this a little more. MC: When will this crisis be over? Do you see any signs, at this point, of a recovery? VP: What you have to understand is that, this is a significant shock to the world economy. Just think about it, when you look at the last 5, 10 years there were two engines of growth. There was the U.S. consumer and credit creation. None of those are likely to be the engines of growth going forward. The world's looking for a new business model. It's about new engines of growth and it's not only about creating stability and saying that we're out of the crisis mode. But we all have work to do as we search for what the new business model is for the world. I am optimistic about the signs that we're seeing, suggesting that stability is arriving. We still have more to look at, to see that it's here for sure, but I'm optimistic that we might start seeing stability in the financial markets, which I think is good, but that's stage one. Stage two is about what kind of world we want to have going forward, what's the new business model? And that's what we're really focused on at Citi. We are a global bank, and by the way, we have a very significant merging business heritage. Two things I'm sure of: the merging markets growth and globalization of trade and finance. We're squarely positioned against both of those. We've taken the harder steps...a lot of the world needs to do the same.","Citibank CEO Pandit: ""We have made a lot of progress in a short period of time""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Thousands of bottles of alcohol were destroyed in Kabul this week, in what authorities described as the product of a crackdown on illegal smuggling and sales. The bottles were confiscated over a two-year period in and around the Afghan capital, according to Kabul police and criminal investigations chief Mohammad Zahir. They were taken almost exclusively from ""Afghan sources and not foreigners,"" he said. The illicit items were being stored by Afghan customs officials, who burned the bottles Wednesday after receiving authorization from the city's attorney general's office, he added. Alcohol is largely banned in Afghanistan, and its sales and consumption considered a criminal offense for the country's . Muslims, who constitute roughly 99% of the population. Certain areas that cater to foreigners, however, are permitted to sell it. Zahir said that it was in these areas -- mostly international hotels -- that local sellers had come into possession of the alcohol.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court voiced deep free speech concerns Tuesday about a law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dog fights and other acts of animal cruelty. Selling depictions of animal cruelty like this amateur dogfighting video may be illegal under a 1999 statute. The justices heard an hour of lively debate about the scope and intent of the decade-old statute that supporters say has done much to stop the spread of profiting from the torture and abuse of animals. But media groups and the National Rifle Association were among those who say the law is overly broad. ""It's not up to the government to decide what are people's worst instincts,"" said Justice Antonin Scalia. ""One can contemplate a lot of other areas, where government could say: You are appealing to people's worst instincts, and, therefore, movies cannot be made"" showing dramatized depictions of animals being abused, for example. ""What about people who like to see human sacrifices?"" asked Justice Samuel Alito, somewhat sarcastically. ""Suppose that is legally taking place someplace in the world. I mean, people here would probably love to see it. Live, pay-per-view, you know, on the Human Sacrifice Channel. They have a point of view they want to express. That's okay?"" He seemed to indicate strongly it was not, and that lawmakers would have discretion to block it. The specific case before the court dealt with tapes showing pit bull dogs attacking other animals and one another in staged confrontations. Watch an excerpt of the tapes » . A federal appeals court had thrown out the conviction of Robert Stevens, a Pittsville, Virginia, man who sold videos through his ""Dogs of Velvet and Steel"" business. According to court records, undercover federal agents found he was advertising his tapes in ""Sporting Dog Journal,"" an underground magazine on illegal dogfighting. Among the products Stevens advertised was ""Catch Dogs,"" featuring pit bulls chasing wild boars on organized hunts and a ""gruesome depiction of a pit bull attacking the lower jaw of a domestic farm pig,"" according to the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based appeals court. Stevens was charged in 2004 with violating interstate commerce laws by selling depictions of animal cruelty. He was later sentenced to 37 months in prison, and promptly appealed. He argued his sentence was longer than the 14 months given professional football player Michael Vick, who ran an illegal dogfighting ring. It was the first prosecution in the United States to proceed to trial under the 1999 law. The divided appeals court concluded that when it came to the federal law in question, ""research and empirical evidence in the record before us simply does not support the notion that banning depictions of animal cruelty is a necessary or even particularly effective means of prosecuting underlying acts of animal cruelty."" Nearly every state and local jurisdiction have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals. Several media organizations have come out in support of Stevens, worrying the federal law was too broad and could implicate reports about deer hunting, and depictions of bull-fighting in Ernest Hemingway novels. A number of justices too had concerns, raising a number of hypotheticals, a possible sign a majority of the court remains uncomfortable with allowing the law to be reinstated. ""Why not do a simpler thing?"" suggested Justice Stephen Breyer. ""Rather than let the public guess as to what these words mean, ask Congress to write a statute that actually aims at those frightful things that it was trying to prohibit. Now, that can be done."" ""You have to look at the content to determine whether or not the speech is prohibited,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. ""How can you tell these aren't political videos? With organizations like PETA [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals] and others, depictions of the same sort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support for efforts to prohibit it. Why aren't these videos the exact opposite of efforts to legalize it?"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned the distinction between Stevens' videos and news items. ""Tell me what the difference is between these videos and [filmmaker] David Roma's documentary on pit bulls? I mean, David Roma's documentary had much, much more footage on the actual animal cruelty than the films at issue here, greater sections of the film, and more explicit,"" she said. Roma's 2006 independent film ""Off the Chain"" consisted of a great deal of hidden camera footage. Among the wide-ranging hypotheticals raised by the justices over what the law could forbid included: fox hunts, pate de foie gras from geese, cock fighting, bullfighting, shooting deer out of season, even Roman gladiator battles. Neal Katyal, an attorney for the Justice Department, said the law was ""narrowly targeted"" and had exceptions specifically for ""religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value."" ""This statute has nothing to do with the offense of the message. It has to do with trying to dry up an underlying market for animal cruelty,"" said Katyal. Justice Samuel Alito appeared most supportive of the government's views. He asked about selling of so-called ""crush"" videos, in which women -- with their faces unseen -- are shown stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spiked-heel shoes or with their bare feet. ""The people who produce 'crush' videos think they have a message, and the message is that this is sexually exciting,"" he said, clearly uncomfortable with the subject matter. When Stevens' lawyer Patricia Millett launched into a caveat-laden answer, Alito broke in. ""You are not even willing to say that this could be prohibited?"" he asked. ""Because we are trying to determine whether this is overly broad. And this is the category of activity that Congress particularly targeted."" Congressional supporters said a principal motivation for passing the law was to stop the growing popularity of ""crush"" videos. The Humane Society said the market for such videos stopped almost completely after the law was passed. Millett said ""Congress has a job to write with a scalpel and not a buzz saw in the First Amendment area."" She noted that if the law is upheld, it would only be the second time the Supreme Court has identified a form of speech undeserving of protection by the First Amendment. The justices in 1982 banned the distribution of child pornography. ""The problem in this case, was that Congress chose to attack speech and to control what the people of this country could see and hear before it was even seriously punishing the conduct at issue and that gets our Constitution upside down,"" Millett told reporters later. The government had argued a ""compelling interest"" in stopping people who would profit from dog attack tapes and similar depictions. The case is U.S. vs. Stevens (08-769) and a ruling is expected in several months.","The justices heard an hour of debate about scope and intent of decade-old statute .

"Washington (CNN) -- Police arrested more than a hundred protesters during an anti-war demonstration outside the White House fence Thursday. The event was part of a rally that also was in support of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, whose website has revealed secret U.S. documents about Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries. ""This lynch mob mentality is America at its lowest,"" said Daniel Ellsberg, a former military analyst who, a generation ago, leaked the ""Pentagon Papers"" to The New York Times. Ellsberg, now 79, told reporters this would be his 80th arrest for civil disobedience in the time since his revelations helped shed light on how badly the war in Vietnam was going for the United States. After a noisy but peaceful demonstration involving a few hundred people, police ordered the group to disperse. Those who refused were then placed in plastic handcuffs, led to a processing tent during a snow shower, photographed and placed on a bus for transport. Ellsberg was among them. Police continued to clear the demonstrators nearly two hours later. U.S. Park Police spokesman Sgt. David Schlosser later told CNN a total of 131 people were arrested and charged with failure to comply with a police order. Most, if not all, were expected to admit guilt, pay a $100 fine and be released. Before the protest began in nearby Lafayette Park, Ellsberg held a news conference with an Australian group that had placed a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for fair treatment of Assange as he fights potential legal action as publisher of secret materials his website received. Assange is Australian. The activist group GetUp said nearly 95,000 of his countrymen have signed a statement of support for him and for the concepts of free speech and presumption of innocence. Ellsberg said there are parallels in the WikiLeaks case with what he went though in 1971 when he supplied The New York Times with details of a top-secret Pentagon study of U.S. decision-making during the Vietnam War. He said of the latest leaks, ""I regard it as a very admirable act,"" and added he believes the person who supplied the information to WikiLeaks acted out of the same obligation ""to inform the American people."" And where the Nixon administration had The New York Times as a clear target for the Pentagon Papers, he said the ""effort now is to distinguish WikiLeaks from the establishment press in order to prosecute."" He called that effort ""a fool's mission,"" since Assange is a digital publisher. The right of The New York Times to publish the Pentagon Papers was eventually upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. ""When I revealed the Pentagon Papers, I thought at most there was a very small chance that it might have an effect on the war, just as sure Bradley Manning didn't have any guarantee what he's doing would have any effect, but he was ready to go to prison for life to have some small chance of doing it,"" Ellsberg said. Manning, a U.S. Army private first class, is a suspect in the WikiLeaks disclosures. He is awaiting trial in a Virginia stockade in connection with earlier WikiLeaks revelations he is accused of involvement with. He has not admitted guilt in either incident, his supporters say.","The anti-war protest also was a rally in support of WikiLeaks .

"Paris (CNN) -- Reaction to the arrest of International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn ranged from concern to outrage to sadness Tuesday in France, where one politician said he was the victim of a ""lynching"" and others cautioned against what they see as a rush to judgment. Underscoring the cultural differences between France and the United States, many French recoiled from images of Strauss-Kahn, who is charged in the alleged sexual assault of a New York hotel housekeeper, in handcuffs and in court -- photographs that would be prohibited under French law to protect the presumption of innocence. Some French speculated about whether he was the target of a political setup, while others questioned what they see as a rush to judgment by U.S. authorities and the American media. ""There's a general feeling of a media, a judicial fury -- of a lynching,"" Jack Lang, France's former minister of culture and education and a Socialist Party lawmaker, told Europe 1 radio. Lang called the American justice system ""inhumane."" ""For 48 hours now, only the side of the accusation has been heard ... and the versions given by police have been contradictory,"" he said. ""The refusal to allow him out on bail, when no violent crime has been committed -- even in America suspects are usually let go on bail if a violent crime has not been committed."" Strauss-Kahn's defense attorneys have insisted he is innocent. Defense attorney Benjamin Brafman on Monday called the case ""very defensible."" ""The forensic evidence, we believe, will not be consistent with a forcible account, and we believe there is a very, very defensible case, and he should be entitled to bail,"" Brafman said during the hearing Monday. A judge disagreed Monday, decreeing Strauss-Kahn a flight risk and denying him bail. He is currently housed in New York's Rikers Island jail complex. Strauss-Kahn's arraignment was televised and clips played on various networks. ""Perp walks,"" in which defendants -- accompanied by police -- walk in front of photographers handcuffed are standard fare in America. ""That is not the case in France,"" where cameras are not allowed in courtrooms, the head of the Socialist Party, Martine Aubry, told reporters Tuesday in Paris. A 2000 law prohibits the publication of photos of a defendant in handcuffs or in court. Aubry said many of her colleagues were ""shocked"" at what they saw. ""Since yesterday we've been overwhelmed by the images and also by the charges against Dominique Strauss-Kahn,"" she said. ""So we are here to say what we have always done unanimously for the last three days, to remind everyone first of all of the presumption of innocence."" She took no questions from reporters. ""I think that for Americans it's the normal procedure, so there's nothing shocking about these pictures, but in France it's true that these pictures are very shocking for us, because in France we don't have the right to show images of a man who is charged but not yet convicted,"" French resident Veritas Galabova, who works in finance, told CNN on Tuesday. ""... It's two cultural points which are different."" Benoit Hamon, spokesman for the Socialist Party, said, ""It's very bizarre, strange for us to see one of our leaders between two American cops, like in a movie."" Some French also said they believe investigators moved too quickly to arrest Strauss-Kahn, who was pulled off a plane to Paris in police custody hours after the alleged incident took place in a $3,000-a-night suite at New York's Sofitel hotel. ""There is a real feeling that there's a rush to justice here,"" said Nathan King, a correspondent for France 24 television network. However, Linda Fairstein, former head of the Manhattan district attorney's sex crimes unit, defended the investigators, saying if the special victims unit ""had probable cause ... they did the only thing that they could do, which was to stop this man before he left the country."" Strauss-Kahn was widely considered a leading contender to be put forth as the Socialist Party's presidential candidate and face President Nicolas Sarkozy in next year's election. ""If you are pro-Sarkozy, you are happy,"" French teacher Paul Verite said Tuesday. ""If you're not pro-Sarkozy, you have many worries, because it was clear that he was the one with the most chance of beating Sarkozy."" Verite said he believes the timing is suspect. ""It makes more sense that it was a setup than that he's really guilty,"" he said. ""It could happen, but it's quite strange for something like this to happen a year before the presidential election."" Explaining the impact of the news in France, King said, ""If John Edwards had won the nomination for the Democratic Party to run for president and then find out everything we know now and add a criminal element to it -- you get how big that is."" Edwards, a former U.S. senator from North Carolina, admitted in January 2010 that he had fathered a child with his mistress. Many French also said they feel Strauss-Kahn hasn't been given a chance to present his side of the story adequately, King said. ""We have a tradition in France ... not to judge one way or the other until the real facts have been clearly established,"" Galabova said. ""For the moment, we have only heard the side of the accusation, and I'm not saying that's not true, but simply that we haven't heard the opposing side and the defense's side, so I think we really have to wait for the real facts to understand what happened."" The Socialist Party's Aubry told reporters, ""So far, we have only heard accusations from the prosecutor. That is the law. They are following it. There you go. It's not our (system). And we are waiting for that other voice, the one of Dominique Strauss-Kahn and his lawyers, which we will hear in the days to come."" The Socialist Party, meanwhile, insisted Tuesday it will not be deterred from its efforts to win back the presidency in 2012. Presidential primaries will be held on schedule, said Hamon, the party spokesman. France typically has a laissez-faire attitude toward extramarital affairs, even if they result in children. News like that involving Edwards or former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who acknowledged Tuesday he fathered a child a decade ago outside of his marriage, doesn't cause much of a stir. When the scandal involving President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky broke during the 1990s, many French said it proved Clinton was strong and could lead the country, King said. The late French President Francois Mitterrand fathered a child during a long-term affair. When asked about it by reporters, King said Tuesday, that Mitterrand responded, ""Yes, of course, but it's my private life."" ""The cultural difference is fascinating,"" King noted. However, criminal charges in the Strauss-Kahn case may decrease the French tolerance, King said. ""I think the French press knows the difference here,"" he said. ""They've long put up with affairs and not reported them ... but this is criminal."" In addition, sympathy for Strauss-Kahn may be eroded, King said, by allegations from French politician Anne Mansouret, who said following Strauss-Kahn's arrest that he attacked her daughter, French journalist Tristane Banon, in 2002. Mansouret said she cautioned her daughter not to report the alleged incident to police out of concern it might adversely affect her career, as Banon was just starting out in journalism. Banon's attorney told CNN Monday they are considering filing a police complaint in light of the charges against Strauss-Kahn. Strauss-Kahn's attorneys have not responded to CNN requests for comment on the 2002 allegations. In arguing against allowing the IMF chief to go free on bond Monday, prosecutors said during his arraignment they believe Strauss-Kahn has engaged in ""similar acts"" at least once before. CNN's Ivan Watson, Saskya Vandoorne, Alanne Orjoux and Catherine Clifford contributed to this report.","Many French find pictures of a handcuffed Dominique Strauss-Kahn disturbing .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles authorities said Friday that they had arrested three people for an attack this spring outside Dodgers Stadium, adding that the man they'd arrested exactly two months ago and described as the ""primary aggressor"" was not responsible. Louie Sanchez, 29, and Marvin Norwood, 30, have been charged with mayhem and assault -- both felonies -- related to the March 31 beating of Bryan Stow, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. Sanchez is also charged with two misdemeanor counts of battery stemming from another incident on the same day. Both men, who are from Rialto, are being held on $500,000 bail. They are expected to appear Monday for their arraignment in Los Angeles Superior Court. A woman was also taken into custody with the men, though she has not yet been charged. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told reporters Friday that charges against the woman -- whom he called 31-year-old Dorene Sanchez -- are pending. Bryan Stow, the man they allegedly attacked, meanwhile remains hospitalized in a San Francisco hospital, recovering from extensive brain and other trauma. Police said the 42-year-old paramedic from Santa Cruz, a Giants fan, was attacked by two men in the parking lot of the Los Angeles Dodgers stadium after the opening game of the Dodgers and Giants seasons. Unprovoked, the men began to kick and punch Stow, yelling profanities about the Giants, before heading off in a car driven by a woman, police said. Stow's mother, Ann Stow, said that her son was first hit from behind, at which point he fell and his head hit the concrete. ""It was just a brutal attack,"" she said. ""Whatever that guy hit my son with, Bryan was unconscious before he hit the ground, so he had no way to protect his head."" Stow was placed in a medically induced coma following the incident. He underwent emergency surgery Monday morning at San Francisco General Hospital, precipitated by ""massive amounts of fluid building up that caused a 30-second seizure,"" his family said on their website. By Friday, though, the family said that Stow's condition had improved and he appeared ""very alert"" -- able to open and close his eyes on command, move his right hand and mouth his last name to medical staff. He struggles to recover as investigators continued to wrestle with a case that's drawn intense public attention. Beck said that police had interviewed more than 600 people and devoted thousands of hours trying to crack the case. They thought they'd gotten their break May 22. Los Angeles authorities announced then that they had arrested Giovanni Ramirez, 31, because they believed he was the ""primary aggressor"" in the attack. Ramirez, a documented gang member associated with the Varrio Nuevo Estrada street gang in East Los Angeles, was then ordered jailed on $1 million bail. On June 20, he was ordered to serve 10 months -- a term that cannot be reduced -- for violating parole related to a 2005 conviction for possession of a firearm, California's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a press release. He previously had been convicted in 1998 for robbery, court records show. But a second charge related to Stow's assault was dropped ""without prejudice"" on that same date ""due to the lack of the evidence presented on that charge,"" the corrections department statement said. Beck said Friday that Ramirez was exonerated as a result of the continuing investigation, adding that police met a ""burden of proof"" required to arrest him, but not to proceed with a criminal case. He conceded that the backtracking may not help police credibility, but said it is ""just as important that we find out the innocent that we find the guilty."" ""What this investigation speaks to is that we do the right thing, even when it's the hard thing,"" Beck said. ""This is about the character of the police department ... even when it reflects badly on us.""","NEW: The man initially arrested for the beating has been exonerated, but remains in jail .

Sanchez has cost the Spanish champions €26 million ($38.2m) but could pay an additional €11.5 ($16.5m) depending on appearances. He will be the first Chilean to play for the Catalan giants and gave clear indications that he wanted to join them in preference to other clubs. ""He has been strongly committed to playing for Barca,"" the statement said. Sanchez will have medical before being officially presented at the Nou Camp Monday. Sanchez, who was voted best player in Serie A last season with 12 goals in 31 games, is Barcelona's first major signing of the close season transfer window. In another major signing Thursday, Portuguese giants Benfica completed the signing of Spain's World Cup winning defender Joan Capdevila from Villarreal. The 33-year-old left-back has been signed as a replacement for Portugal international Fabio Coentrao, who departed Lisbon for Real Madrid earlier this month. Capdevila played every match of Spain's successful campaign in South Africa and the former Atletico Madrid full-back has signed a two-year deal at the Estadio de Luz. The one-time Deportivo la Coruna player has represented Spain on 57 occasions and was also part of Luis Aragones' victorious Euro 2008 squad. Elsewhere, Dutch coach Ronald Koeman returned to football Thursday after agreeing to take the reigns at Dutch first division club Feyenoord. The 48-year-old has been out of the sport since leaving AZ Alkmaar in December 2009 and signed a one-year deal with the Rotterdam side. As a player, Koeman won the 1988 European Championships with Netherlands and the European Cup with both Barcelona and PSV. He also spent two years with Feyenoord between 1995-97. Former Feyenoord coach Mario Been left the club after a disappointing season yielded a 10th place finish in the league and saw the one-time European champions humiliated 10-0 by PSV Eindhoven last October. Koeman has previously had spells in charge of Ajax, Benfica, PSV and Valencia.","Alexis Sanchez joins Barcelona from Serie A Udinese in big money deal .

"Editor's note: The following story, based on testimony in Phillip Garrido's trial for a 1976 kidnapping, contains some sexually explicit material. Phillip Garrido is show in an early mug shot taken in connection with the 1976 rape and abduction case. (CNN) -- Fifteen years before the girl was held captive in the shed, there was the woman in the warehouse -- and at least one other woman who escaped capture. Phillip Garrido, who with his wife is charged in the 1991 kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard, had been convicted of kidnapping before. When he stalked, kidnapped and raped Katie Callaway Hall on November 22, 1976, he fulfilled an overpowering sexual fantasy that he had methodically planned for weeks, according to court records obtained by CNN. He told police it was his second kidnapping attempt of the day. Those facts came to light in Garrido's 1977 trial, in which he was convicted and sentenced to 50 years for kidnapping and rape. In her testimony, Hall said Garrido asked for a ride in her car, then bound and handcuffed her before taking her to a small warehouse in Reno, Nevada, where he repeatedly raped her for 5½ hours. It was not an act of impulse. ""He told me he had been renting it [the small warehouse] for a couple weeks, preparing it,"" Hall testified.  Watch how Garrido prepared for and explained the kidnapping » . It is CNN policy to withhold the identity of alleged victims of sexual assault. But in this case, Hall recounted her ordeal last week in an interview on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" saying it changed her life forever. ""I had to tell everyone I met what had happened to me -- because I didn't feel like myself. It was as if I had to explain why I wasn't 'normal,' "" she said.  Watch Hall describe her ordeal » . She was not his first victim that day. The trial transcript reveals that Garrido told authorities that one hour before Hall's kidnapping, he tried to kidnap another woman, who wrestled away and escaped. And, police in Antioch disclosed last week that Garrido was charged with raping a 14-year-old in 1972, but the charges were dropped because the victim refused to testify.   Watch details of the 1972 case » . In the case involving Hall, CNN reviewed the 1977 trial documents, which include Garrido's psychiatric evaluation and the testimony of Hall and Garrido. The documents reveal a pattern of behavior that Garrido is accused of repeating in the 1991 kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard, who was recently found after being kept in a shed for 18 years. The 32-year-old documents also detail Garrido's self-described struggle with drugs and his efforts to control his sexual obsessions.  Can sex offenders be cured? » . Garrido and his wife, Nancy, have pleaded not guilty to charges involving Dugard's abduction, but police say he admitted kidnapping her in his initial interview. Police say Garrido and his wife kidnapped Dugard outside her home in South Lake Tahoe, California, and took her to an elaborate compound hidden in the backyard of their Antioch, California, home more than 160 miles away. Tucked behind overgrown trees and a fence were tents, outbuildings and a soundproof shed where Dugard lived with the two daughters she had with her captor. Out of sight . Garrido took great pains to make sure nobody could find the camp, not even the parole officer who visited twice a month at times, police said. Hall, too, was taken directly to a carefully prepped small warehouse after her kidnapping. As they drove from South Lake Tahoe, California, where she was abducted, to Reno, she tried to persuade Garrido to rape her in the bushes. ""I asked him, couldn't we just pull over and get it over with,"" she testified. But Garrido was determined. ""You might as well get that our of your mind; you are going with me, you have got no choice,"" Hall testified Garrido told her, according to court transcripts. ""I have it all planned."" He had set up the mini-warehouse in Reno exactly as he wanted, and worked to ensure nobody would inquire about it. He asked a man who lived in a storage unit 30 feet away to call him should any unknown vehicles show up. The mini-warehouse was meticulously furnished. On the other side of an unassuming metal, garage-style door, the walls were covered in long, heavy rugs hanging from the ceiling. Thick opaque plastic sheets were scattered throughout, creating a maze-like atmosphere that prohibited anyone from seeing all the way through, Hall testified. Staging the attacks . In the back, Garrido created a space set up like a stage. At the center was a mattress covered with an old, red satin, hole-ridden sheet and a fur blanket, Hall testified. Illuminating the bed were red, yellow and blue stage lights, with a stack of pornographic magazines and a projector alongside it. His intent, a prosecution psychologist said, couldn't have been clearer based on the methodical planning. From the moment she got to the mini-warehouse, Hall said it was clear to her Garrido was a man on a mission. ""He knew what he was doing,"" she testified. ""[He] knew exactly how he was going to do it."" She testified that it was there that he raped her for 5½ hours. As he drank wine and she smoked a small bit of hashish, Hall said she kept track of the time by listening to a radio, which regularly announced the time. Hall didn't know that she wasn't originally part of the plan, although Garrido alluded to the fact he hadn't targeted her, saying it wasn't intentional that she was taken. ""Could have been anybody,"" Hall recalled him saying, adding he told her it was her fault because she was attractive. He didn't say that his original plan had gone awry one hour earlier. Victim managed to escape . Despite his planning, there was one thing Garrido hadn't accounted for -- that one of his intended victims would fight back. One hour before Hall was kidnapped in her own vehicle, Garrido asked a different woman in South Lake Tahoe, California, for a ride. Like Hall, she obliged. But when he tried to handcuff her, he only secured one hand. ""She jumped out of the vehicle, struggling with him,"" prosecutors told the judge during a private conversation during the trial. When he unlocked the one handcuff, she escaped by jumping out of the moving car and running up the street. That kidnapping attempt came to light in a conversation between the prosecutor, defense attorney and judge in the case, according to the trial transcript. Despite prosecutors' wishes, the details of the first kidnapping attempt were kept from the jury, after a judge ruled they weren't necessary to prove Garrido's intent to kidnap. The court documents also discussed Garrido's use of marijuana, cocaine and LSD, which Garrido said was so heavy it fueled his sexual desires and sometimes pushed him to a point he could no longer control them. He said he responded to the urges by masturbating in drive-in movie theaters, restaurants, bathrooms, bars and while watching partially clothed or naked women in their homes. An interest in young girls . Though police have recently said they never expected Garrido would have kidnapped someone as young as Dugard based on his record, Garrido's own words during his trial showed young girls did grab his attention.  Watch how Garrido slipped through the cracks » . He admitted masturbating in his car while watching small girls outside their school. Sometimes, he said, he would open the car door, get out and pull down his pants. His own explanation of his sexual fantasies hinted at an obsession with sexual bondage and captivity. ""There has been a type of bondage pictures,"" he said, when asked if certain images heightened his arousal. ""Women in handcuffs, chained."" On the night he took Hall captive and bound her with a leather strap in her car, he said he took four hits of LSD, a drug that he said he used daily for at least four years, sometimes taking up to 10 hits at a time. He said when he used the drug it acted as a sexual stimulant. ""I had this fantasy that was driving me to do this inside of me,"" Garrido testified. ""Something that was making me want to do it without -- no way to stop."" Garrido said the urges would strike and continue to build until he was ""overcome"" with sexual cravings. Hall was curious, too, even during her kidnapping, what would make Garrido do this to her. So she asked him. ""He said that he didn't get off on pain,"" Hall recalled during her testimony. ""It was just a fantasy he had to live out.""","Trial transcripts show Phillip Garrido tried to kidnap woman before Katie Hall in 1976 .

"(CNN) -- A man opened fire at a Texas roller skating rink during a birthday party for one of his children, killing his estranged wife and four of her family members before turning the gun on himself, police said Sunday. Tan Do, 35, and Trini Do, 29, were hosting the party at the Roller World Skating Rink in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie, Texas, on Saturday for one of their two children, Grand Prairie police said in a statement. ""The couple had been involved in ongoing marital problems and it is believed that this led to the shooting,"" police said. ""Trini Do was among the deceased."" Police responded to a call of a shooting at 7:10 p.m. Saturday (8:10 p.m. ET). Officers found the bodies of five people; a sixth person -- the suspect -- with a gunshot wound to the head; and four other people who had sustained non-life-threatening injuries.

"(CNN) -- Former FIFA presidential hopeful Mohamed Bin Hammam believes that soccer's ruling body has already decided he is guilty of bribery. The ex-head of the Asian Football Confederation was suspended pending an investigation on May 29, having been accused of trying to buy votes in his bid to win the July 1 election against incumbent Sepp Blatter. FIFA's ethics committee has begun a two-day hearing to decide the Qatari's fate, and the 62-year-old is pessimistic ahead of the verdict. ""I want you all to know that my legal team and I remain confident that the case and the evidence presented against me are weak and unsubstantiated,"" Bin Hammam said via his official website on Friday. Bin Hammam wants a ""fair FIFA hearing"" ""They are flimsy and will not stand up to scrutiny in any court of law; that has been clear throughout this process and it remains to be so. ""I am not confident that the hearing will be conducted in the manner any of us would like. It seems likely that FIFA has already made its decision weeks ago. So, none of us should be completely surprised if a guilty verdict is returned."" Bin Hammam vowed to clear his name if he is found guilty. ""Justice will eventually prevail whether through the FIFA ethics committee, the Court of Arbitration of Sport or, if necessary, through other courts or legal proceedings in courts where we will be equal and no special privileges will be granted to either party."" FIFA set date for Bin Hammam verdict . Bin Hammam withdrew from the presidential election in the wake of the accusations, with Blatter maintaining the position for a fourth term. Jack Warner, the former head of football in North and Central America and the Caribbean, faced similar charges to Bin Hammam. The investigation into Warner was stopped, with his innocence presumed, after the Trinidadian resigned in June.","Mohamed Bin Hammam believes FIFA has already decided he is guilty of bribery .

"(CNN) -- Gilles Simon secured his second title of the 2011 season by defeating Nicolas Almagro to lift the German Tennis Championships in Hamburg. The Frenchman beat his Spanish opponent 6-4 4-6 6-4 in two hours and 38 minutes to claim his ninth career triumph. Simon's victory was his first on clay since the BRD Nastase Tiriac Trophy in 2008 and will see him move up to 11 in the world rankings. Under the roof at the Rothenbaum Tennis Center, Simon, the number five seed, needed just one break of serve to take the opening set, after his opponent had squandered eight break points. Almagro edged the second set but an early break in the decider set Simon on course for his first title since winning the Medibank International in Australia back in January. ""I feel very, very good. I had to win so many tough matches this week,"" Simon told the ATP World Tour's official web site. ""Today, the final was really hard to win. I had to play my best tennis to win and I'm proud to win this tournament."" ""It was a high intensity final. I think Nicolas played very good tennis, very consistent,"" said Simon. ""I knew before he could hit very hard, but also, he didn't miss anything, so I really had to fight hard on every point. We played almost three hours and it was a really, really hard match."" ""I think the first game of the third set, I didn't play my best tennis. That game, I made three mistakes in the important moments,"" admitted Almagro. ""He played really well.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Violence and heavy metal seem to have been inextricably entwined since the dawn of the metal genre. Accusations that the Columbine killers were influenced by Marilyn Manson's music were found to be false. Judas Priest, Marilyn Manson and Black Sabbath are just some of the household metal names to have come under public fire for supposedly inciting teenagers to commit murder and suicide. It's a fire the international media has been happy to flame, quick to draw links between various acts of savagery and heavy metal even if, as in the case of the Columbine shootings and Marilyn Manson, evidence points to the contrary. For anthropologist, documentary filmmaker and self-confessed ""Metalhead"" Sam Dunn, heavy metal is often used as a scapegoat to distract from the thoroughly more complicated societal problems surrounding such incidents. ""I think people look at heavy metal and label it for all sorts of things because we need easy answers to complex questions,"" Dunn says. ""I think that it's easy to target a heavy metal band for inciting violence or making kids turn to a cult than it is to actually look at real problems in the real world."" It's easy to see where the journalists, parents and religious groups get their ideas from. A quick scan of the lyrics of any heavy metal band worth its salt will often reveal some gasp-inducing subject matter. For instance in his film ""A Headbanger's Journey,"" Dunn quotes some of his favourite lyrics by a metal band called Autopsy: ""Burning from the inside out, bloody foam spews from your mouth, smell the putrid stench of flesh, as it burns you to your death."" Not the sort of poetry to be quoting to grandmother over lunch, but can such ludicrous gore really incite people to violence, not to mention murder? As one young Norwegian metal fan told the UK's Guardian newspaper: ""It's all fantasy, none of this is real, you can't take this seriously, it's just like a movie."" But compared to some of the images filling our cinema screens -- The Devil's Rejects, Wolf Creek, The Passion of the Christ to name a few -- even Autopsy's lyrics seem a little tame. ""I have listened to enough metal for me to essentially be a serial killer,"" says James McMahon from UK music magazine NME. ""But there's something in me that says no, that's not what I believe life is about. Serial killers existed before Slayer, you know."" ""I'm a big fan of horror movies but Hostel, Saw, those torture porn films, I found myself repulsed -- metal is pantomime comparatively."" As Alice Cooper quips: ""There's more blood in 'Macbeth' than in my shows and that's required school reading."" For metal musicians, death, blood and mayhem, in its various guises, are all simply part of the act, part of ""the show."" ""I think it comes from being a child of the '70s,"" says Iron Maiden's lead singer Bruce Dickinson. ""I was brought up on Hammer horror movies and things like ""The Devil Rides Out,"" classics like that."" ""So while we do the devil type things, it's done... I wouldn't always say in a tongue-in-cheek way, but there is an element of it. It's done with a view to storytelling and drama, with a bit of dressing-up going on."" Iron Maiden has also endured its fair share of controversy. The title of its 1982 album, ""The Number of the Beast,"" and repeated use of ""666"" in the titular track's chorus had America's religious right up in arms. They accused the band of being devil worshippers, Satanists and of ""trying to pervert our kids."" ""When I play that song I think, well, ok, this isn't glorifying the devil, because that's certainly not what I would do,"" says Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain, a born-again Christian. ""It's making an awareness that yes he's out there, and you've got to be aware. There is a man with 666 tattooed on his noggin somewhere."" Ironically, the fundamentalist reaction to ""The Number of the Beast"" packed out Iron Maiden tour gigs in every American town they visited. Kids squeezed into arenas desperate to see what was scaring their parents so badly. Despite this marketing draw, Dickinson is keen to distance Iron Maiden from the violence for violence's sake approach practiced by some of his contemporaries, such as musicians from the extreme Black Metal and Death Metal sub-genres. ""We're not interested in being extreme,"" he says. ""We're interested in being interesting and in animating people's imaginations with the stories that we tell and the songs."" It's an approach that chimes with what one female Iron Maiden fan, Ruth, tells us, ""I really don't see any violence in the fans and I have been to loads of their gigs,"" she says. ""I am in a tiny minority of women, in a room full of men wearing black -- which should seem scary, but it totally isn't. The men hold doors open for me and apologize if they bash into me. They are basically really meek and polite."" So while upside-down crucifixes, homicidal zombies and lashings of blood might continue to fuel our preconceptions about heavy metal music, it's worth remembering, appearances and reality can be very different beasts indeed.","Heavy metal used as a scapegoat according to anthropologist .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Sixteen people -- including five children -- died when an oil tanker carrying fuel for NATO exploded Saturday morning in Khyber Agency, a district in Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan, a government official said. A remote-controlled bomb caused the explosion, said Shafeer Ullah Khan, a top government official of Khyber Agency. Khan said the bomb was planted under the oil tanker, which exploded when the vehicle was about 8 kilometers (5 miles) east of Afghan border. Khan said when the people in the area gathered to collect oil leaked from the tank, it caught fire and killed the 16 people. A NATO spokesman said the alliance won't be commenting. Khan said in another incident on Friday evening, nine oil tankers carrying fuel for NATO caught fire after a planted bomb was also detonated by a remote control at Torkham, at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. He said the oil tankers were parked at the border waiting their turn to enter in Afghanistan. It was not immediately clear who was behind either attack. In the past year, dozens of oil tankers carrying fuel for NATO forces in Afghanistan have been attacked in Pakistan. Militants in the region have frequently targeted Pakistani security forces and supply trucks headed for Afghanistan in an effort to undermine U.S. and NATO efforts there. At least 29 people have died in such attacks since October. The tankers are often operated by contracted Pakistani firms hired by NATO, using Pakistani equipment and drivers.","NEW: NATO issues no comment on the incident .

"(CNN) -- Three times, Adrian Pracon prepared to die on Utoya island, a Norwegian paradise turned to hell Friday. Friends he laughed with earlier in the day fell one by one in a gunman's hail of fire. He survived to tell a horrifying tale Saturday. When the shooting started Friday afternoon, many of the 600 people at the ruling Labour Party's youth camp ran down a hill and to the water. The shooter came after them, screaming. ""You are all going to die!"" Pracon was one of the last ones remaining between the shooter and the water and didn't have time to take his heavy clothes or boots off. About 100 meters into the chilly water, he realized he would not make it. He would drown with all that weight. ""I felt I couldn't breathe. I already swallowed too much water,"" he said. ""I felt the clothes pulling me down."" He managed to swim back to shore and crouched behind a boulder with others. But the gunman found him. He was so close that Pracon could see down the barrel of his weapon. He was sure to get a direct hit. Pracon thought he was going to die. Another survivor, Otzar Fagerheim, described the gunman as having blond hair and pale skin. He carried three guns, he said. At times, he shot those guns with disarming calm, like he was shooting photographs. He even smiled, Fagerheim said. Pracon was surprised to hear the shooter speaking Norwegian. He was certain a compatriot could never commit such a heinous act. Pracon spoke back. ""Do you want to hurt a fellow Norwegian? Please, no. Don't shoot."" Miraculously, the gunman pointed his weapon away. Instead, he aimed for those who were desperately trying to swim to safety. As though Pracon was too easy a target. As though it was more satisfying to shoot at a group of fleeing people, Pracon thought. He heard his friends begging for help. Some fell limp on Pracon. The gunman went away but returned to find Pracon again, hiding with about 10 others. The madness started again. More rounds of gunfire. He could hear so many of them say: ""Please don't shoot me."" One by one, their voices were silenced. A woman next to him was shot in the leg. Pracon could see her wound was gaping. Pracon clung to the dead. Tried to play dead. It was the only way he knew to survive. He heard footsteps getting closer. He could hear the heavy breathing of the man. Then, ""boom!"" Pracon's world fell silent. His hearing was gone. But he could feel intense pain on the back of his left shoulder. He bore it, lay face down, and kept perfectly still. ""I am sure he intended to hit me in the head,"" Pracon said. The gunman missed by inches. 'I had to get out of there' That afternoon, before the carnage, Stine Renate Haheim spoke to her party's youth about violence against women and children. It's a big issue for the young member of parliament, who began her political career a decade ago in the youth movement. She came to idyllic Utoya island often for such gatherings -- 11 times, to be exact. It was ""the most beautiful adventure of the summer,"" she said. She drew inspiration from Utoya. It was an important place for people from all over Norway to gather to discuss the future of their own nation as well as the problems plaguing other parts of the world. It was a place to get away from the daily grind, the day-to-day debates in parliament, and think big. And most of all, Haheim said, Utoya was a place of fraternity, of peace. ""We love it there,"" she said. Everything changed Friday. It will be remembered from now on as a place where 85 people died, seemingly for no reason. Eskil Pedersen, a youth movement leader, assured everyone that they would be able to speak with counselors about the carnage they witnessed. ""We will not be threatened to silence,"" he said. ""We will continue fighting for what we believe in. This is the best way to honor the memory of those we have now lost. We will go back to Utoya."" But it will be difficult. Haheim will hear the gunfire play over and over again in her head, just like she did Friday. After her speech Friday afternoon, she was informed about the explosion in downtown Oslo. Many of the youth camp attendees huddled for an informational meeting on what was happening to their colleagues in the government buildings. But when the shots rang out, the 600 people at the main building and surrounding camp scattered. Haheim quickly realized she should not be alone and followed others tumbling down the hill. Like Pracon, she hid behind boulders on the beach. When there was a lull in the shooting, she thought it was over. But then it started again. Terrifying minutes that seemed never-ending. She repositioned herself in another spot, away from the gunman's sight. She found herself with a girl, shivering in her underwear, who had shed her clothes in a desperate but failed bid to swim away. Haheim took off her jacket to warm her companion. ""What is your name? Where are you from? Nice to meet you,"" they said to each other. ""It was a conversation about nothing,"" Haheim said. That's how they found calm in that moment of fear. Haheim called her father, a police officer, on her mobile phone. ""The police are on their way,"" he reassured her. She imagined that all the police and ambulances in the area had rushed to Oslo after the bombings. So her father's words gave her relief. Maybe the madness would end soon. Shortly thereafter, she could hear helicopters overhead, and vehicles with sirens in the distance. She was one of the older people at the gathering. She felt a sense of obligation to calm the younger people around her. Some were still in their teens. ""You find some kind of way to get freakishly calm in that situation,"" she said. Finally, she heard someone say: ""The police are here. We are safe."" She hugged the man next to her. But within moments, the shooting began again. They had all been deceived -- the gunman was wearing a police uniform. ""Run, run, run!"" Haheim shouted. The rocks were slippery. She stumbled, fell, picked herself up. She had to keep running. ""The only thing on my mind was that I had to get out of there,"" she said. 'Bloody, bloody mess' When real police officers finally showed up, the survivors were suspect. Were these more gunmen in uniform? ""Everyone started screaming, crying, begging the police to throw away their weapons,"" Pracon said. After about a two-hour ordeal, Pracon and Haheim were rescued -- Haheim without injury and Pracon with a gunshot wound that was closed up at the hospital. Police arrested a man the Norwegian media identified as Anders Behring Breivik, 32, a Norwegian who apparently had taken issue with his homeland's growing multi-culturalism. It was only many hours later, in his hospital bed, that Pracon began realizing the magnitude of the ""bloody, bloody mess."" Recuperating after stitches Saturday, Pracon said fear was setting in anew. Now he would begin to discover the names of the dead. They were friends who would never again share a laugh with him. Police and rescue teams were still combing Utoya island -- 13 boats on the water and a meter-by-meter land search, said Sven Mollekleiv, president of Norwegian Red Cross. ""We have now also mothers and fathers who don't know if their sons or daughters are alive,"" Mollekleiv said. ""They are just waiting."" Doctors cleared Pracon for solid food Saturday afternoon and he sought comfort in a plate of lasagna. ""It was a perfect dinner for me right now,"" he said. A moment of joy, perhaps. But for Pracon, Haheim and other survivors of the slaughter, a long journey of healing lies ahead.","Adrian Pracon survived to tell a grim tale .

"(CNN) -- One of the most widely read authors of recent times, Brazilian-born novelist Paulo Coelho talks exclusively to CNN about what Brazil means to him. Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, the best-selling author of ""The Alchemist"" dreamt of becoming a writer from an early age, but was stifled by his parents, who insisted he follow his father's footsteps and become an engineer. But only a year into his studies the adventurous young Brazilian had dropped out, and by the 1970s had made a name for himself in Brazil's politically infused artistic movement, becoming a successful songwriter and co-creator of the controversial comic strip ""Kring-ha."" However, his messages were viewed as left-wing and dangerous: Coelho was branded a ""subversive"" by Brazil's then-ruling military government and was arrested and tortured. The experience had a strong affect on the writer and by the 1980s, Coelho had abandoned his artistic lifestyle and settled down. However, his passion for writing continued and after a few unsuccessful first starts, Coelho hit major success with his 1988 novel, ""The Alchemist."" Initially only given a small print run, the book eventually became a global bestseller, garnering numerous literary awards -- translated into 67 languages and edited in more than 150 countries. Now a household name, the novelist and United Nations messenger for peace talks to CNN about what he loves most about his country. CNN: What does Brazil mean to you? Paulo Coelho: Brazil is my way to see the world. Being born in that country means: ""you don't have a wall separating the physical reality from the magical reality."" Therefore, since my childhood I learned that to understand the world we need to go further and take the risks of sailing in unknown seas. CNN: What do you like most about Brazil today? PC: My people.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Raw video clips of Michael Jackson's last rehearsals will not be shown in the involuntary manslaughter trial of the late pop singer's personal physician, the judge ruled Monday. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor spent several hours at Sony Pictures Studio on Friday reviewing about a dozen hours of video that prosecutors or defense lawyers proposed for the jury to see. ""It was a waste of my time,"" Pastor said. It was not immediately clear if the prosecution would still be allowed to show parts of the ""This Is It"" documentary about Jackson's preparations for his London comeback shows. Defense lawyers had suggested clips ""left on the cutting room"" floor by the documentary editors might show that Jackson was in failing health in the days before his June 25, 2009, death. ""It's quite the contrary,"" Pastor said. Lawyers for each side spent two weeks this month viewing more than 100 hours of video, narrowing down what they thought was relevant to the case. The prosecution selected 12 hours of video, while the defense identified four. Defense lawyer Michael Flanagan said after a hearing last Wednesday that the video showed him that Jackson was ""very talented, that he's pretty good; even on his bad days, he's good."" The defense was looking for clues in the video to show that Jackson was in ill health in his final days, but Flanagan said it was not detectable in his performance video. Jackson also did not appear to be depressed in his final days, he said. The defense will argue that none of the ""This Is It"" video is relevant to the criminal trial and would be ""a big waste of time."" ""It shows him onstage performing,"" Flanagan said. ""I don't know why that's relevant as to what happened the night that he died when he couldn't sleep."" Jackson's death was from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol combined with other drugs, the Los Angeles coroner ruled. Murray, whom Jackson hired to care for him as he prepared for his comeback concerts in London, allegedly administered the fatal dose. Jury selection in the trial is set to begin on September 8 in a Los Angeles County courtroom, with opening statements later in the month. CNN's Michael Cary contributed to this report.","The judge says viewing raw video was ""a waste of my time""

"(CNN) -- Norway's Alexander Dale Oen won gold in the 100m breaststroke in an emotional day of medal winning at the FINA World Championships in Shanghai. The 26-year-old pointed to a Norwegian flag in reference to the shootings in his home country on Friday that claimed the lives of over 90 people. ""It's a very special medal after what happened in my country in the last days,"" he told FINA's official web site after his victory. ""Seeing the flag, hearing the national anthem, everything was coming back and even though it's been three days, it is still a shock."" Elsewhere, tears were shed when the Brazilian Cesar Cielo won the 50 meters butterfly, but not from all quarters. Cielo had been banned for alleged doping offences earlier in the year but, after taking his case to the Court for Arbitration in Sport (CAS), the ruling was overturned four days before the race. As Cielo wept during the medal ceremony, other swimmers made pointed gestures, unhappy at his appearance. It was reported that some members of the crowd jeered his victory too. ""This gold has definitely a different taste than the other ones. That was probably the hardest medal in my life; I knew I was going to race against the world's best, and to be able to compete after what I have been through this last month is really a blessing,"" Cielo told FINA's official web site. ""With what happened, it was a time to test how much I could take and if I would be able to stand up again, and I am really proud of myself for doing this. Medals are important but I cannot imagine my life without the environment of swimming."" The U.S. and China won their first gold medals when American swimmer Dana Vollmer triumphed in the 100m butterfly and 15-year-old Shiwen Ye secured the 200 meter individual medley for the hosts.","Norway's Alexander Dale Oen wins gold at the FINA World Championship .

"(CNN) -- A clean-cut young man buys tons of fertilizer, which he uses to create a huge bomb. He puts it into a box truck, brings it into the middle of the city, and then sets off a massive, and deadly, blast. That happened in 1995, when Timothy McVeigh unleashed terror in Oklahoma City. And it happened again Friday in Oslo, Norway, when, police say, a 32-year-old man sparked a explosion that killed seven people in the heart of the city center. In Norway, the suspect allegedly and then traveled 20 miles to Utoya island, where he gunned down at least 85 others at a youth camp. Sixteen years and nearly 5,000 miles separate the sites of the bombings. Yet Kari Watkins, executive director of the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, said she has been flooded by calls and e-mails from survivors, victims' relatives and others affected by the attack in that Midwestern city who have been shaken by this week's violence in Scandinavia. ""It's a senseless and needless attack,"" said Watkins, noting that the Norway incident caused ""flashbacks"" for many. ""And it's almost exactly what our people went through."" It has struck close to home in two parts of the world, in part because both McVeigh and the prime suspect in the Norwegian attacks are being painted as ""domestic terrorists."" Scores of innocent civilians, including a number of children, were killed in both locations as attackers went after symbols and institutions -- in McVeigh's case a U.S. federal government building, and in the other a Norwegian government building and a youth camp affiliated with the ruling political party. McVeigh had some help from Terry Nichols, who was convicted and is serving a life sentence for conspiracy and manslaughter for helping build the bomb; and Michael Fortier, convicted for failing to alert authorities. Meanwhile, Acting National Police Chief Sveinung Sponheim said that although only one man had been arrested as of Saturday, Norwegian police have yet to determine definitely that only a single person was responsible for both of the Norwegian attacks. Growing up, McVeigh didn't appear to stand out, working at Burger King and a security guard. With his crew cut, the son of a automobile factory-line worker and homemaker looked the part of an all-American and even joined the military, where he became a decorated Army veteran before leaving the service. Anders Behring Breivik, who Norwegian media have identified as the first and then only person detained in the more recent attack, appears to fit the role of a quintessential Norwegian. Pictures show him with blond hair, blue-green eyes and chiseled features, dressed in a preppy style. He had been a youth and adult member of the conservative Fremskrittspartiet (FrP) or Progress Party, VG newspaper reports, but there has been no indication he'd ever been arrested prior to this week. Yet police say they believe the Norwegian is responsible for the deadliest attack ever on its soil. That was true for McVeigh, too, before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""When it's one of your own, when it's one of our folks doing it to us, it's hard to stomach,"" said Watkins, who joined the memorial effort soon after the 1995 attack. Both Breivik, according to reports, and McVeigh had extreme political agendas. In the American's case, this included a growing disillusionment with the federal government. He viewed its treatment of the Iraqi people as that of a schoolyard bully, then became angered at its role in the disastrous raids at the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, and the cabin of white separatist Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Up through his execution in 2001, McVeigh never expressed remorse for his role in the Oklahoma City bombing that left 168 dead. The suspect in the bombing and mass shooting in Norway conceded the terrorist attacks in that nation were ""horrible,"" but ""in his head (they) were necessary,"" a man who identified himself as the suspect's lawyer told Norwegian broadcaster TV2. Geir Lippestad told TV2 late Saturday that Breivik ""is ready to explain himself"" in a court hearing Monday. The fact the Norwegian suspect doesn't look the part of a terrorist, especially in an age marked by threats and strikes by members of the Islamic fundamentalist group al Qaeda, doesn't surprise Watkins. One thing the Oklahoma City bombing taught her is that ""evil doesn't have to look like a monster."" That is one of many lessons learned by people in and around Oklahoma's capital. Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett said that another is that there's no one, clear path toward emotional recovery from such a traumatic event. ""It's impossible to sum up the emotions of an entire city,"" the mayor said. ""It's so emotional individually."" Cornett said that, in time, the experience made the Oklahoma City ""stronger,"" more united and more patriotic, invigorated by the sense that ""we were not going to let a criminal act tear us apart."" And Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg spoke to this sentiment hours after the attacks, when he vowed, ""You won't destroy our democracy ... No one will bomb us into silence. No one can scare us from being Norway."" The people of Oklahoma City know, more than most, that such resiliency is possible -- but it is also difficult. Watkins said that the city's memorial and museum plans to offer its assistance to the people of Norway, including children's psychiatric counseling and other resources. One lesson that the Midwestern city's residents have learned, the hard way, is that evil exists and it can strike at any time -- at times perpetrated by seemingly the least likely people. ""It seems so simple that we should be able to stop this, but it's so much harder than that,"" Watkins said. CNN's Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.","Bombs in both Oklahoma City and Oslo were made from fertilizer .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The top U.S. envoy to Iraq said Sunday that the results of the recent Iraqi national election mark a turning point for democracy there, but he warned that challenges remain. Former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's secular Iraqiya bloc won 91 seats in the 325-member Council of Representatives in the March 7 elections, edging ahead of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's State of Law coalition, which received 89, according to elections officials. Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, said the results suggest ""there there is democracy in this country."" ""People have looked at different candidates, and people have gone in different directions,"" Hill told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""And so, I think frankly, it's a good sign that Iraq could have this election."" Allawi also acknowledged Sunday the significance of the results, saying Iraqis ""voted against sectarianism"" when they voted for his secular coalition. ""They don't want to see sectarianism prevailing in this country,"" Allawi told CNN. ""They want to have a government that can provide services, can provide security and ensure stability of the country, and improve the income of the Iraqi family."" Hill pointed to the challenges Iraqi officials have had to overcome leading up to the elections -- including deadly bombings of government buildings last fall and a delay in passing a key election law. ""What is important is that they've gotten this far,"" Hill said. ""When you look at some of the problems [that] have come up in Iraq in the last six months ... a lot of people predicted the Iraqis can't get through that. Indeed they got through ... those challenges and now they have an even bigger challenge, and I would not bet against them."" Hill said Allawi's biggest test will be in how he campaigns for more seats to achieve a majority in the Iraqi parliament. Hill said Allawi must be inclusive in assembling supporters and building a government. ""If you're the frontrunner -- as Mr. Allawi is right now -- you've got to look out there to other coalitions (and) say how can I put together a government that's going to work?"" said Hill, adding ""This isn't all about ... who's a Shia or who's a Sunni; it's about who can govern better."" Allawi appeared up to the challenge Sunday, saying he wants a ""quick formation of a strong government"" and one ""that can take Iraq forward."" ""We fought for democracy, and we are continuing to fight for democracy,"" Allawi said. ""That's why we are ready to talk to everyone who is ready to engage and ready to play by the roles of democracy. ... Even if they have been nasty to us and not positive in their dealing with us ... we have an open mind.""","Christopher Hill is the U.S. ambassador to Iraq .

"(CNN) -- European leaders are meeting to attempt to resolve the debt crisis in Greece and prevent it infecting other countries -- an outcome that could potentially tear apart the 17-member eurozone and lead to another global economic slump. So what can they hope to achieve, what's behind the crisis and how serious is it? Who is meeting and why? Eurozone leaders are gathering in Brussels, including French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. They are meeting to discuss ways to bring Greece's spiraling debt problem under control, chiefly through a multi-billion dollar bailout package. They are also addressing concerns that Greece's woes could infect other eurozone countries. Why is Greece in trouble? Years of unrestrained spending, cheap lending and a failure to implement financial reforms left Greece badly exposed when the global economic downturn struck. This revealed partly-fiddled statistics that showed debt levels and deficits exceeded eurozone limits. As the dust settled, it emerged that Greece is teetering on the brink of default as it faces debts of about $500 billion. It has become reliant on international funds to make repayments. How bad is it? Bad enough to warrant an initial $145 billion bail out last year. Now, with the crisis showing no sign of abating, another multi-billion dollar bail out is in on the table. The initial package assumed Greece would eventually be able to borrow again from the open market, but high lending rates mean this has been impossible and a second rescue is needed. This, however, will only be forthcoming if European leaders can agree on terms. Why is the rest of Europe worried? Greece's woes reflect badly on the credibility of the euro. A default from Greece is also bound to rekindle fears of possible defaults by other bailed-out euro nations, like Portugal and Ireland, and re-ignite the debate on whether the eurozone can survive. See a map of Europe's debt levels . This could knock the whole bloc into the red, affecting the global economy. And if European countries continue to resort to rescue packages involving bodies such as the International Monetary Fund, this would further damage the euro's reputation and could lead to a substantial fall against other key currencies, especially the U.S. dollar. Why is the second bailout package a problem? The eurozone's leading economy Germany has been at loggerheads with the rest of Europe over how Greece should repay its spiraling debt. Germany has been pushing for a ""soft restructuring"" of Greece's loans -- a move that would make private investors share the burden -- but the European Central Bank has warned any compulsory restructuring could lead to a broader crisis. Talks between finance ministers have until now failed to reach consensus, resulting in the latest summit between eurozone leaders. Can a deal be reached? Early indications are favorable. Sarkozy and Merkel -- arguably the two most influential participants -- have reportedly thrashed out a possible solution ahead of the summit. Details aren't clear but the Financial Times says they have already run the plan past European Union President Herman van Rompuy and Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank. That said, many European leaders involved in the talks will be wary of agreeing to anything that commits them to using public cash to fund the bailouts. Some are also likely to argue that any deal reached now can only be palliative, failing to stop the crisis spreading at a later date. What are the likely solutions? There are several possibilities. The most basic fix would see a reduction in interest payments made by Greece on earlier rescue loans and a fresh bailout of about $150 billion to plug impending holes in the Greek economy. Another option is a rollover of debt -- which would buy time, but not solve the problem. There is also talk of a controversial $42 billion tax on banks. This would raise bailout money without putting a strain on the public purse, but would involve a major legal shake up across the eurozone. Also up for discussion is a $628 billion expansion of eurozone crisis funds to deal with further problems. What if no deal is reached? The doomday scenario sees a dramatic slide in confidence as investors retreat from European financial markets. This pushes up the cost of borrowing across the region, triggering new fears about the threat of debt crises in Spain and Italy. This begins to drag on countries with debt exposure to Spain and Italy. Eventually, the whole eurozone could be pushed the brink, generating financial shockwaves across the world that will herald a new global economic slump. What is Greece doing to help itself? To be fair, Greece isn't standing idly by. It has already imposed hugely unpopular austerity measures against an explosive backdrop of public discontent. It is also taking drastic steps to ease its debt burden by selling off numerous assets. It is looking at an extensive privatization program that could see it unload prized assets including stakes in banks, railways, utility firms, ports and the postal service. There is also a plan to offload Hellenikon, Athens' former international airport. Other measures include floating Olympic and tourism property assets on the stock exchange and issuing gaming licenses. The target is to raise about $71 billion by 2015.","European leaders are meeting in Brussels to try to solve Greece's economic crisis .

"(CNN) -- At least four people were killed and dozens more were injured on Saturday when security forces in the restive Syrian city of Homs Saturday greeted anguished mourners with brute force, an activist told CNN. The latest confrontation rattled a country on edge after at least 44 people died in Homs and other cities Friday when Syrian security personnel fired at demonstrators, according to the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria. The violence erupted after as tens of thousands of people marched in a funeral procession and went to a graveyard to bury some of the Friday's victims, the activist said. The assault began after mourners were filing out of the cemetery, the activist said. ""We were chanting and praying for the martyrs and they just sprayed us with their bullets. I saw seven to eight people on the ground bleeding and moaning. I ran as fast as I could as bullets flew past us towards the fields and hid among the olive trees until another mourner saw me and helped me walk to the main road,"" the activist said. ""From there I ran to my apartment to see my wife and children. We live very close to the graveyard and I can still hear the sound of heavy gunfire coming from the area."" Security forces earlier used force against 300 demonstrators in Homs who were demanding the right of mourners to march through the city center. But security forces forcefully put down the turnout in about 30 minutes, and many of the demonstrators were arrested. Later Saturday, tens of thousands of people gathered for the funeral procession on the outskirts of the city to bury eight victims of the Friday demonstrations, and it appeared the event would remain peaceful. The miles-long funeral procession defiantly passed by army stations and several tanks, but the marchers were greeted kindly by soldiers to which the crowd responded by chanting, ""The people and the army are one hand."" However, violence erupted as security forces stepped in, the activist said. Mourners quickly dispersed some into the graveyards and surrounding fields, and gunfire could be heard. CNN has not been granted access into Syria and is unable to independently verify witness accounts. The deaths occurred after demonstrations broke out after Friday prayers in Syrian cities, as they have for weeks. Every week, the demonstrations have particular themes. May 20 was Azadi Friday in honor of the Syrian Kurdish protesters. Azadi means ""freedom"" in Kurdish. A military source quoted by the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said at least 17 civilians and security personnel were killed on Friday by the unidentified ""armed groups"" the government has been blaming for the discord. For two months, Syria has been torn by street protests against political repression and a fierce security crackdown against demonstrators. The government's fierce actions toward marchers and its thousands of mass arrests have drawn widespread criticism. Around 830 people have been killed in protests, according to the Syrian Human Rights Information Link. That number does not include security personnel, many of whom have been killed in attacks by ""armed groups,"" according to the Syrian government. The United States has imposed sanctions on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other senior officials. On Thursday, President Barack Obama singled out Syria for criticism during his speech on the Middle East. The clashes have spurred people to flee to other countries, such as Turkey and Lebanon. Seven injured Syrians and four others people crossed the border into Turkey and were brought to Antakya state hospital Friday night, according to a doctor and the Hatay province governor quoted by Turkey's state-run Anatolian Agency. The doctor at the Antakya State Hospital said the patients were between the ages of 25 and 40 and the injuries stemmed from gunshots. One patient was in intensive care and some of them had injuries on their feet. Another patient who was shot on the eye, was transferred to the university hospital in Hatay. About 250 Syrians fled to Turkey end of April, mostly from Latakia, on the western coast of Syria. They have been living in a tent camp set up by the Turkish Red Crescent for them in the border town of Yayladagi since then. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and al-Assad developed close ties between Turkey and Syria in recent years. Turkey lifted visa restrictions on Syrian visitors last year. But escalating violence in Syria is increasing worries of the Turkish government which has been advocating a ""zero problems"" foreign policy with its neighbors. The U.N. refugee agency on Friday said it is helping serve the thousands of Syrians who ""escaped to the border areas of Wadi Khaled and Tall Bire in northern Lebanon. "" ""Local leaders say some 1,400 people have crossed into these two regions over the past week from Tall Kalakh in Syria. ""This is in addition to those that have crossed since late April. Local authorities estimate that around 4,000 Syrians have crossed to Lebanon recently,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The agency said many have found refuge with host families or relatives and some have taken shelter in a school. The Human Rights Watch on Friday said locally elected officials are estimating that 3,500 Syrians ""are currently present"" in the Wadi Khaled area. But it criticized Lebanon's security forces for detaining Syrian refugees in some instances. It said nine Syrian men and a child have been detained since Sunday. The relatives and friends of these people said they fled to Lebanon because they were afraid Syrian forces would arrest or shoot them. ""Lebanese authorities should instead provide them with at least temporary asylum, and above all refrain from deporting them back to Syria,"" Human Rights Watch said. ""Syria welcomed many Lebanese fleeing war back in 2006,"" said Nadim Houry, Beirut director at Human Rights Watch. ""Now it's time to return the favor. Lebanon should be offering immediate refuge to Syrians fleeing death or torture in their country.""

"(CNN) -- In Sao Paulo's affluent Butanta neighborhood, a green haven in the heart of the notoriously polluted megalopolis, Guilherme Amaral Nunes, 25, and partner Luiz Ramirez, 51, enjoy a brief respite from the limelight. While trying to seem tranquil while playing with their ""children,"" two rescued dogs and a cat, excitement is building as news of their plans to become the first married gay couple in Sao Paulo goes viral. On Monday, court papers are set to publish their names as the first couple to petition for a marriage license in this conservative-leaning state, two weeks since Brazil's Supreme Tribunal ruled unanimously that the nation should recognize gay marriages. ""We feel anxious until we hear the results,"" Ramirez said. ""We hope we won't receive a legal challenge to block our dreams."" Nearly two weeks ago, Brazil's highest court voted on behalf of gay marriages by 10-0. The court ruled that the same rights and rules that apply to the ""stable union"" of heterosexual couples will apply to same-sex couples, including the right to joint declaration of income tax, pension, inheritance and property sharing. Argentina became the first Latin American nation to approve same-sex marriages in 2010. Mexico City recognized same-sex marriages in 2009. Several other countries in the region now recognize same-sex unions. Brazil's ruling, however, does not allow same-sex marriage. It leaves it to judges to evaluate on a case-by-case basis. ""It's not like Argentina, where the law is more evolved, Nunes said. ""But it's a step ahead,"" he said. On Friday, Ramirez and Nunes took the first legal step to legalize their union. Holding hands and brushing off some curious onlookers in one of the city's busiest public registries, the two delivered a petition to convert their civil union document into a marriage certificate. Next stop, the Sao Paulo courts, Ramirez said. That is where the fate of their legal bond will be decided by a judge. ""This is not really about us,"" said Nunes, who added that his job as an IT consultant for HP already allows them to have very good same-sex benefits. ""It will be a victory for many of us, many of my friends who suffered discrimination."" According to many gay rights groups in Brazil, discrimination and bullying is rampant in Brazil, despite generational and cultural changes. Ramirez, president of CORSA, a large gay-activist group, said government studies show that 260 people die a year in Brazil as a result of homophobia. Gay people in Brazil, as in other Latin American nations heavily influenced by the Catholic Church, continue to encounter strong resistance. ""On one hand, we have made some considerable judicial strides,"" said Ramirez, who helped turned Sao Paulo's gay parade into one of the world's largest. ""On the other, the intensity and frequency of homophobia in Brazil is alarming,"" he said. Ramirez was referring to a hotly contested issue by Brazilian lawmakers on the proposal to distribute the so-called ""homophobia-kit"" in public schools, an educational packet that includes a DVD and other information distributed through Brazil's Ministry of Education to address homophobia among Brazil's youth. Ultraconservative lawmaker Jair Messia Bolsonaro of Rio de Janeiro, has led the outcry against the ministry's move to deliver the packets, joining hands with evangelist lawmakers, who are growing in numbers. ""I have now seen the most scandalous thing I have ever seen in my 20 years in politics, and of course I am not talking about corruption, which is a daily matter here in our circles,"" he said. ""Attention parents of 7-, 8-, 9- and 10-year-olds in public schools! Next year, your children are going to receive educational kits titled, 'Combating homophobia,"" Bolsonaro told Brazil's House of Deputies in November. ""But what this is is an incentive to enforce homosexuality and promiscuity,"" he said. Bolsonaro claimed that in one of the videos, a boy named Ricardo goes to the bathroom to urinate when he sees another boy and falls in love. ""Listen here lawmakers, this was published in our congressional papers. This could be your son one day,"" he said. Brazilian Minister of Education Fernando Haddad denied that the so-called ""kit homophobia"" circulating among lawmakers was created by his office. During a meeting Thursday with evangelical and other conservative lawmakers, Haddad said the kit was still being put together by his ministry. ""Yesterday, this material was delivered to the Ministry of Education from hired NGOs,"" Haddad told Agencia Brasil. ""Now, we will have an internal debate within the ministry,"" he said. While the debate heats up in conservative circles, throughout Brazil, gay couples are trickling into local courts to fight for their marriage rights. ""This is not about making people gay. This is about letting people who are gay live respectfully and in peace,"" Ramirez said. ""There won't be any more gays in Brazil as a result,"" he said. ""But there will be happier ones."" CNN's Marilia Brocchetto and journalist Luciani Gomes contributed to this report.","Nearly two weeks ago, Brazil's highest court overwhelmingly voted to allow gay marriage .

"New York (CNN) -- Health advisories were issued for four beaches in New York City Thursday evening as wastewater from a plant continued to discharge into the Hudson River, according to a press release from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. A four-alarm fire at the North River wastewater treatment plant triggered flooding of wastewater into the Hudson River Wednesday morning, after a blaze began in the plant's engine room. The health advisories were issued for South Beach, Midland Beach and Cedar Grove Beach on Staten Island, and Sea Gate in Brooklyn, according to the release. The beaches are not closed but the New York City Department of Health recommends that people not swim or enter the water at those locations. They also recommend that young or elderly people, or anyone who suffers from a medical condition not go near the water at those beaches. The advisories will last through Monday. Popular Coney Island Beach was unaffected by the advisories as of Thursday evening. All employees at the plant were accounted for following the incident with no injuries, New York City Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Cas Holloway told CNN affiliate WPIX. The facility was not operational on Thursday evening but department staff and contractors were inside the facility working to bring the plant online. The plant is responsible for treating 120 million gallons of wastewater a day on Manhattan's west side.","A fire at a wastewater treatment plant triggered a release into the Hudson River .

"(CNN) -- Civic-minded residents of Bismarck and Mandan, North Dakota, found there's nothing like a major flood to make new friends while filling thousands of sandbags. As cities along the Missouri River brace for the onslaught, the ""Sunday Sandbag Thrown-Down"" in Bismarck resulted in 1,600 people producing about 300,000 sandbags in six hours, Burleigh County Commissioner Mark Armstrong said. ""The crisis is just beginning,"" Armstrong said Wednesday. ""There has been a great community spirit."" Over the past few weeks, Armstrong, who has filed several CNN IReport photos and videos of the river and flooding, has been sounding the alarm over the threat to the community. Already, 2,400 residents and 632 homes in the county have been evacuated, he said, adding most of the displaced are staying with family and friends. ""It's going to get worse,"" the official said. ""People who never saw water in their basements are seeing water."" Such flooding hasn't happened here in nearly 60 years, before a system of Missouri River dams in North Dakota and South Dakota were in place. In recent weeks, about 15 miles of emergency levees have been built in the capital area, according to Armstrong. Upstream, at Garrison Dam, a peak release of 150,000 cubic feet of water per second is expected later this month. Heavy rains and snow pack runoff could result in near-record flooding along significants portions of the Missouri River this year, officials have said. Armstrong is concerned that a fast melt of an unusually heavy snow pack in Montana could have devastating consequences. Rainfall of 3 to 5 inches in July and August also could potentially destroy levees, he said. Hundreds of National Guard members are in the area, performing levee patrols and other duties. Across the Upper Midwest, townspeople are remembering the devastating Missouri River flood of 1952, which caused tens of thousands to flee. The 1952 flood saturated parts of downtown Omaha before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed the current flood protection system, according to CNN affiliate KMTV. The Missouri River in Omaha was at 30.38 Wednesday, slightly more than its peak during the 1993 flood, said National Weather Service meteorologist Rick Chermok. It is expected to rise to more than 32 feet by Tuesday, he said. Flood stage is 29 feet. By comparison, the river was at a record 40.20 feet on April 18, 1952. It had an astounding water flow of 396,000 cubic feet per second. The Army Corps of Engineers, which controls the dams, said Wednesday that it is committed to the Missouri River flood fight. ""This will be a long, sometimes frustrating and intense effort as the situation evolves and as we work together to avoid loss of life, minimize damages and help communities deal with the situation,"" said Brig. Gen. John McMahon, commander of the Corps' Northwestern Division. ""The Corps is committed to doing its best in close collaboration with city, county, state and federal agencies as well as congressional representatives and others as we address this daunting challenge."" The Missouri River was 1.39 feet above flood stage Wednesday afternoon at Bismarck, with an increase expected later in the week.

"New York (CNN) -- A grand jury indicted Levi Aron on Wednesday as authorities revealed new details about the death of the 8-year-old Brooklyn boy he is accused of kidnapping and killing last week. The grand jury indicted Aron, 35, on eight counts, including two of felony murder in the first degree. If convicted, he would face a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole, Kings County District Attorney Charles Hynes announced. Hynes had said he would ask a grand jury for the ""maximum charges permitted by law"" for ""the vicious and callous murder and dismemberment of 8-year-old Leiby Kletzky."" The indictment accuses Aron of abducting Kletzky in his Brooklyn neighborhood on July 11. After kidnapping the boy, the indictment says, Aron took him to Aron's apartment and killed him there, according to a statement from Hynes' office. ""I should note that the child's body contained marks on the wrist ... which would indicate at some point that he was tied,"" Hynes told reporters. Hours before Hynes announced the indictment, New York City's chief medical examiner said that Kletzky died after being drugged and then smothered. ""We charge that the child was kept for more than 12 hours, that it was an intent to kill, and that's based on ingestion of the medication,"" Hynes said. The autopsy results for Kletzky listed a cocktail of four prescription and over-the-counter drugs in the boy's system:  cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant; quetiapine, an antipsychotic drug; hydrocodone, a pain medication; and acetaminophen, the drug found in Tylenol, according to a statement from the medical examiner's office. Kletzky disappeared July 11 while walking home alone from his summer day camp. Police located human remains in Aron's freezer during a search of the Brooklyn neighborhood, as well as in a trash bin. Both Aron and Kletzky are members of the borough's close-knit Orthodox Jewish community, although police say it doesn't appear that they knew each other. On Wednesday, Hynes detailed some of the evidence that he alleged links Aron to the kidnapping and killing -- including extensive video footage that shows Kletzky talking to a man and following him to a brown car authorities later traced to Aron. Detectives later concluded that Aron was also the man they saw in the video footage, Hynes said. Aron, who was being held without bail, did not enter a plea at his arraignment last week. He is under a suicide watch. A mental evaluation that his attorneys asked be conducted on their client has been completed but the results have not been released, said attorney Gerard Marrone. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said last week that Aron told authorities he was sorry for the trouble he has caused.  Statements made by the suspect indicated that he kidnapped Kletzky and, as the neighborhood search for the boy intensified, he panicked and killed him, Kelly said. Aron is currently at Bellevue Hospital Center, where doctors are examining him, Hynes said. ""His mental capacity is a question for the doctors,"" Hynes said, adding that he expected their findings to be released before a scheduled court appearance July 28. Defense attorneys Marrone and Pierre Bazile say Aron has said he hears voices and hallucinates. ""He's been hearing voices for quite some time,"" Marrone told reporters at a news conference Monday, adding that his client tries to silence the voices by listening to music. ""He listens to it with earphones and he listens to it very loud, and that helps him quell some of his voices."" ""I have sincerest concerns about the defendant's mental state and his cognitive abilities,"" Bazile said Wednesday. Kelly called the case ""heartbreaking."" ""Obviously in this business you see a lot of violence, but there's usually some sort of irrational twisted logic that's given to why a violent event took place,"" Kelly said in a news conference last week. ""Here, I mean, it's just, it defies all logic and I think that's what's really so, so terribly disturbing about this case. There's absolutely no reason. There's nothing more innocent than an 8-year-old child and to be, you know, killed in this manner it's just ... heartbreaking."" On the day he disappeared, Kletzky was supposed to meet his parents after walking seven blocks from his summer day camp, but he became lost and asked the suspect for directions, Kelly said. Surveillance video showed Aron entering a dentist's office while Kletzky waited for him across the street for seven minutes, Kelly said. Aron claims he took Kletzky to a wedding July 11 in Monsey, New York, and then brought him back, Kelly said. Police said Aron went to the wedding, but they have not been able to confirm that Kletzky went with him, as no one has said they saw him. Hynes said Wednesday that authorities have evidence showing that Kletzky had been in Monsey, saying a clerk reported seeing the boy at a gas station there. According to Kelly, police showed up at Aron's third-floor attic apartment at 2:40 a.m. July 13 and asked him about Kletzky's whereabouts. The suspect pointed them to the kitchen, where blood was visible on the freezer handle. Inside the refrigerator was a cutting board with three blood-spattered carving knives, Kelly said. Remains were found in Aron's freezer and in a trash bin more than two miles away, wrapped in a black plastic garbage bag inside a suitcase, Kelly said. Aron worked as a clerk at a maintenance supply company, authorities said.  His only known criminal summons was for urinating in public last year. The grand jury's charges against Aron on Wednesday also included three counts of murder in the second degree, two counts of kidnapping in the first degree and one count of kidnapping in the second degree.

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Anthony Weiner has said he has no plans to resign over a ""sexting"" scandal, and that his wife wants him to stay in Congress, a Democratic source told CNN Thursday. Weiner made the remarks to a House Democratic colleague from New York on Wednesday afternoon, rejecting growing calls from fellow legislators -- including key Democrats -- for him to step down, said the source, who was familiar with the conversation. Weiner also cited polling data showing a majority of New York City voters want him to remain in office, the source said, describing Weiner as ""dug in."" The source spoke to CNN on the condition that the name of the Democratic New York lawmaker to whom Weiner spoke would not be made public, because it was a private conversation. After more than a week of bad news that began over Memorial Day weekend with the first reports of his sexual-tinged online communications with several women, Weiner got some good news Thursday: new polling information showed 56% percent of constituents in his home disrict want him to stay on. However, Democratic colleagues on Thursday continued to call for him to bow out, including veteran Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy and Utah Rep. Jim Matheson. Leahy, who ranks second in Senate seniority, ""supports Minority Leader (Nancy) Pelosi's request for a House investigation, and he believes that a decision by Congressman Weiner to voluntarily leave office would be in the best interests of his constituents and the House,"" Leahy spokesman David Carle said. He and Matheson joined Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Reps. Allyson Schwartz of Pennsylvania, Michael Michaud of Maine, Mike Ross of Arkansas, Niki Tsongas of Massachusetts, Larry Kissell of North Carolina and Joe Donnelly of Indiana in calling for Weiner's resignation. ""Enough is enough,"" Donnelly said in a written statement. ""It's time for Congressman Weiner to resign. His actions have disgraced the Congress. Everyone should be focused on jobs and the economy, and his refusal to do the right thing is a distraction."" In addition, Donnelly and some other Democrats have announced that previous campaign contributions they received from Weiner would be donated to charity. Another top Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, stopped short of calling for Weiner's resignation but offered a barb attributed to former President Woodrow Wilson in saying, ""Don't murder someone who is already committing suicide."" ""I think he has some serious problems that will not go away soon,"" Durbin added. The actual quote attributed to Wilson, a Democratic President who served from 1913 to 1921, is: ""Never attempt to murder a man who is committing suicide."" A Democratic legislator familiar with discussions on the situation told CNN that Weiner's colleagues are telling him he should resign ""to preserve his own dignity."" The legislator, who spoke on condition of not being identified by name in order to discuss private conversations, said the public call by Schwartz was part of a stepped-up effort to force Weiner out. According to the source, the effort includes private and public calls explicitly telling him it's time for him to leave Congress. ""There is increased resentment by his colleagues that far from having a press conference where he was going to tell the truth and roll with the flames, the flames are just getting worse and he's dragging us through it,"" the source said. ""We really thought by now, after the press conference, we would be able to talk about the Republicans' Social Security privatization bill and instead we keep talking about Anthony Weiner. And people are getting angrier and more resentful."" A new explicit photograph now published on the Internet, allegedly of Weiner's naked genitals, is the latest example of how the issue is not going away, the Democratic legislator said, adding it was unclear if Weiner would listen. Meanwhile, it is highly likely Weiner's district will be eliminated as part of next year's redistricting process, multiple New York Democratic sources told CNN. New York will lose two of its 29 U.S. House seats by 2012 in line with recent U.S. Census results. Weiner, who is married, admitted earlier this week that he engaged in sexually tinged communications with multiple women and lied about it. Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, are expecting their first child, CNN has learned. Pelosi, D-California, who called Monday for an ethics investigation, released a letter Tuesday detailing her formal request for the inquiry. She has not spoken on or released further statements on what she thinks Weiner should do. Weiner, who has said he would welcome an ethics probe, publicly apologized Monday for sending flirtatious messages and images on Facebook and Twitter to six women over the past three years and then denying it for a week. Over the past three days, he has been reaching out to a number of colleagues and supporters, according to one source. Among other things, Weiner called former President Bill Clinton -- who officiated at his wedding ceremony -- to personally express regret for his actions. According to a Democratic congressman who got one of the calls, Weiner was ""very contrite"" and said he ""let everyone down."" The legislator, speaking on condition of not being named because it was a private conversation, said Weiner was so choked up he could ""barely get the words out,"" and told him that he was going to ""get some help."" Wednesday's publication online of the explicit photo that a conservative blogger claims shows Weiner's genitals was the latest twist in the scandal. Andrew Breitbart, whose biggovernment.com website broke the story of Weiner's sexting, said the photo came from a woman who told him Weiner sent it to her. Weiner acknowledged Monday that such an X-rated photo of him could exist. Also Wednesday, one of the women with whom Weiner communicated online said the congressman initiated sexual exchanges. ""I would want to talk politics. But he would turn it creepy,"" Lisa Weiss, a 40-year-old blackjack dealer from Las Vegas, told CBS' ""Inside Edition."" Weiss said she believes Weiner has ""a weird fetish,"" but that ""it doesn't make him a bad politician ... or a bad congressman. It makes him a bad husband."" Asked what she'd say to Weiner's wife, Weiss said: ""I want to apologize. I should not have been flirting with her husband."" An ethics investigation would examine if Weiner violated House rules or brought the chamber into disrepute. The code of conduct for members of Congress calls for them to conduct themselves ""at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House."" However, ethics experts say legislators are rarely, if ever, disciplined for violating that rule alone. Using government technology such as telephones and computers for his sexting could be another story. Weiner said Monday he used his personal BlackBerry and home computer, but added: ""I don't have the knowledge of every last communication, but I don't believe that I used any government resources."" Even if he did, that doesn't automatically subject him to House discipline, said Stan Brand, a former House general counsel who has represented legislators before the ethics panel. Members of Congress sometimes use official resources for nongovernment activities, Brand noted, adding that ""the House has never taken a position or disciplined someone for that use.""

"(CNN) -- Efforts to reform the Afghan National Police force have been stymied by ""corruption and lack of political will,"" and police are wrongly being used to help fight the insurgency instead of crime, an independent research group said in a report. An Afghan policeman guards the scene of a suicide attack in Kabul on November 27. ""The U.S. military ... still mainly sees the police as an auxiliary security force rather than an enforcer of the law,"" the International Crisis Group concluded in a report posted Thursday on its Web site. ""Too much emphasis is still placed on using the police to fight the insurgency rather than crime. ""The Afghan National Police (ANP) is ill-equipped for this role, and has been targeted by the Taliban, with 1,200 killed in 2007 and a similar toll expected in 2008,"" the group added. The Taliban will be on the agenda during the first visit by Pakistan's president to Afghanistan on Friday. The talks come amid ongoing warfare and tension along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Some of the Taliban militants conducting attacks in Afghanistan have been based in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province and nearby tribal regions. ""The goal of the Afghan government and the international community should be a national police force able to uphold the rule of law, and thereby help tackle the root causes of alienation that drive the insurgency,"" the International Crisis Group said. The group described Afghanistan's Interior Ministry as a ""hub of systemic corruption,"" and accuses the department of placing ""personal enrichment"" above the need for improved policing. Recent leadership changes at the Interior Ministry should be used to stress that abuses will no longer be tolerated. ""There has been little political will in Kabul or foreign capitals to tackle the power brokers who are preventing reform,"" said Samina Ahmed, the group's South Asia project director. ""Organized crime and lawlessness lie at the heart of much popular disillusionment and instability. Better law enforcement, including a functioning judicial system, would help counter any appeal the insurgents may hold in Afghanistan,"" he added. The International Crisis Group covers more than 60 countries and territories, using field-based analysis and advocacy to deter and resolve deadly conflicts.","Afghan National Police is ill-equipped to fight insurgents, group says .

"Marietta, Georgia (CNN) -- A Georgia woman who potentially faced more jail time than the driver who struck and killed her son last year was spared any time behind bars Wednesday. Raquel Nelson of Marietta was sentenced to 12 months of probation and 40 hours of community service by Judge Kathryn Tanksley. Half of those hours must relate to child safety. Nelson has already faced the ultimate nightmare for a mother -- seeing her child die after being struck by a car in 2010. She initially faced up to 36 months in jail in connection with the incident -- a sentence six times longer than the time served by the driver of the car that hit her son. The case had become a cause for radio talk show hosts, the NAACP and even transportation advocates, who said Nelson is being punished because she chose to cross the road at the bus stop across from her apartment instead of traveling to the nearest crosswalk, three-tenths of a mile away. ""Your office's decision to prosecute Raquel Nelson for the death of her four-year-old son on a vehicular homicide charge is disgusting and inhumane,"" wrote one poster to the Facebook page of the Cobb County Solicitor General's office, which is handling the case. More than 135,000 people have signed an online petition calling for leniency. ""It's just so confusing and unreal that it would happen in this manner,"" said Loretta Williams, Nelson's aunt. Nelson and her three children had just gotten off the bus at a stop across from their apartment building in October 2010 when her 4-year-old son, A.J., broke away from her and ran into the street. A car struck the boy. Nelson and one of her two daughters also suffered minor injuries. Five weeks after the accident, investigators came to Nelson's home, Williams said. She was charged with three misdemeanors -- second-degree vehicular homicide, failing to cross at a crosswalk and reckless conduct, according to court records. A jury convicted her last week. Each count carried a potential sentence of one year in jail. The man driving the car, Jerry Guy, fled the scene after the accident, but later admitted being involved, according to CNN affiliate WXIA-TV. He was sentenced to five years in prison, but served only six months. He is serving the remainder of the sentence on probation. A representative of the Cobb County Solicitor General's office said the agency could not comment on the case until sentencing is complete. The NAACP called the case against Nelson a ""grave miscarriage of justice when the mother who is still grieving is forced to fight harder for her freedom than the man who killed her son."" The case has also attracted attention from transportation advocates, who say Nelson is being treated unfairly because transportation planners fail to take into account the needs of pedestrians when designing roads. ""Because she did as her fellow bus riders, who crossed at the same time and same place, and because she did what pedestrians will do every time -- take the shortest reasonable path -- she is guilty of vehicular homicide,"" Transportation for America communications director David Goldberg wrote on the advocacy organization's blog. Nelson had hoped to receive a minimal sentence Tuesday, Williams said. CNN's Tristan Smith contributed to this report.","A Georgia woman whose son was struck and killed will not go to jail .

"(CNN) -- Alaska's a big place. It sounds obvious, but it's an important fact to remember when planning a visit, because you won't get to see everything in one trip. I spent the first 24 years of my life in four different Alaska towns, and there are still new things to do when I go back to visit. So tip No. 1 is to make some decisions: Do you want to camp in a national park? Hike to the top of a glacier? Go backcountry skiing? Catch and/or eat some of the best seafood in the country? See the northern lights? You won't be able to do it all, but with a bit of planning you can pack quite a few adventures into a week or two. Here are some ideas for activities based on a recent trip I took with some friends: . As the state's largest city and home to its biggest airport, Anchorage is the place where many will start their adventures on the Last Frontier -- and our trip was no different. The city is surrounded by water on two sides and a mountain range on the third. At sea level, the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail skirts the city along the water. It's an 11-mile paved trail available for walking and cycling, or skiing and snowshoeing, depending on the season. For those looking for more elevation, Chugach State Park is just east of the city and has several trails. I recommend heading up Flattop Mountain. It's a relatively short hike, just 1.5 miles from the trailhead to the mountain top, but the trail is steep in parts, especially near the summit. With a bit of care, though, most people shouldn't have too much trouble making it up and enjoying the sweeping view of the city and surrounding scenery. On our trip, we left Anchorage after a couple of days and drove 130 miles south to Seward. From there, we spent a day hiking alongside Exit Glacier in Kenai Fjords National Park. The National Park Service calls this 7.4-mile hike ""strenuous,"" but seeing the ice field at the top makes the hard work worthwhile. And it doesn't get much better than an Alaskan Amber beer and fresh halibut once you make it back down. If your legs are tired from hiking, you can work out your arms with a sea kayaking trip in Resurrection Bay. The clouds were low the day of our excursion, but we saw bald eagles in the tree tops and were escorted by sea lions as we paddled along the rocky shoreline. To finish off our Alaska adventure, we left Seward and drove 360 miles up to Denali National Park, home of the tallest peak in North America, Mount McKinley. The public is allowed to drive only a few miles into the park, but there are buses that provide access farther into the wilderness. On our bus ride we saw bears, mountain goats, moose and coyotes. A few lucky visitors will get to see wolves, but sightings are rare. After a few nights of camping in the park, it was time to drive back to Anchorage and catch our flights home. And even though we experienced a lot during our visit, there are plenty more adventures to be had when we go back. Like fishing for king salmon on the Kenai River, or watching the northern lights while relaxing in natural hot springs, or downhill skiing in Hatcher Pass, or sailing along the Inside Passage, or panning for gold in the Tanana Valley, or ...","Alaska is a huge state, so start by figuring out what kinds of things you want to do .

"London, England (CNN) -- Boasting 6,000 seats, a 360-degree glass viewing concourse and an elliptical race track which required 56 kilometers (35 miles) of surface timber from sustainably-sourced Siberian pine for its construction, the velodrome for the 2012 London Olympics has been unveiled as the pride of local organizers. Pressure to deliver is always a concern for the host city of the quadrennial Olympiad -- with Athens and Atlanta being notable illustrators of the struggle endured in 2004 and 1996 respectively -- and it is a demand keenly felt in the capital of Britain, 18 months before the start of the latest edition of the iconic Games. Olympic Development Agency chairman John Armitt said the completion of the venue marked the site's ""biggest milestone to-date,"" emphasizing the ambition of all associated with event to maintain the ""on-budget, on-time theme"" set by the velodrome. Whether this goal can be achieved has yet to be seen but lead architect for the cycle-center project, Mike Taylor, told CNN he felt the aesthetic challenge set for his team had been met. ""[The aesthetic] was fundamental, because most velodromes end up being on a piece of government land somewhere. This site was always going to be in the Olympic Park, so ... we designed it [instead] for legacy. ""We put a ring of glass all the way around the venue because we thought we could landscape the park up to the glass, allowing anybody to walk up and look in to see the cyclists,"" Taylor, of Hopkins Architects, said. Creatively, the team tried to use the vehicle at the center of the building's function as inspiration; namely the bicycle. ""We hadn't designed a velodrome before, so at the beginning we sat down with the engineers and looked at it with a clean sheet of paper, and I think that was a big advantage,"" Taylor said. ""We decided to base everything on the bicycle -- so the engineering would be infused with that sense of efficiency and lightness. The roof, for instance, is held up with cables that are only 36 millimeters in diameter, [but] there's 100 tonnes of steel in the whole roof, so it's incredibly efficient. ""On top of that, we have daylight streaming in, very sustainable [lightning]; the model of the bike has been reapplied to the architecture and engineering of the building in this way."" The echoes of strength provided to the wheels of a bike via the tension of its spokes with the construction of the sweeping roof is obvious, but it proved to be only the first of many hurdles to be crossed in the design and construction process. ""The track is a real piece of difficult furnishing to build. It's 250 meters long, it's made up of 40 by 40-millimeter sections, five or six meters in length, of Siberian pine which was specifically selected because the trees grow very straight,"" Taylor said. ""It's got no expansion joints in it, so when it's hot and dries out it tends to move up and down, so it sits in a concrete bowl, almost like a piece of furniture."" The smooth curves of the new oval track, with its vertiginous banks at either end, was designed by specialist Ron Webb. And though the British cyclists -- four-time Olympic gold medallist Chris Hoy among them -- who tested out the decking for the first time seemed happy with the results, Taylor could only look on with envy. ""I'm a cyclist myself, we're all dying to have a go, but today it's their turn."" The plan is for the $150 million stadium to remain at the center of British cycling once the Olympic Games have finished. London 2012 will also have a road-cycle circuit, mountain-bike track and BMX layout to create what is hoped will be an ""all-in-one"" cycling hub for all disciplines.","The velodrome for the 2012 Olympics is the first venue to open in London ahead of Games .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City's Carlos Tevez will not be returning to Corinthians after the Brazilian club pulled out of negotiations to sign the Argentina striker on Wednesday. Corinthians had wanted to bring the 27-year-old back to the team he represented between 2004-06, but they have now said it would be impossible to conclude the deal before the Brazilian transfer window shuts on 20 July. City manager Roberto Mancini said on Monday the English FA Cup winners had accepted a bid from the Sao Paulo outfit for Tevez, but it seems Corinthians were unable to close the deal. ""The board of Corinthians hereby officially announce the impossibility of hiring the Argentine striker Carlos Tevez,"" read a statement on the club's official web site. Copa America flops: Who is to blame? ""While acknowledging the efforts of Manchester City and all involved in the negotiation, more time is needed for the transfer to be achieved, given that the window to sign players from abroad closes on Wednesday, 20 July."" Despite being unable to conclude a deal for the forward, the team based at the Pacaembu Stadium did not rule out a future bid for Tevez. ""We are aware our fans wanted Tevez to join our club again and we hope we can have the player with us in the future,"" the statement added. Tevez has been linked with a move away from the Etihad Stadium since handing in a transfer request in December 2010. City accept Corinthians offer for Carlos Tevez . The former West Ham United striker arrived in England in 2006 and moved to City from their local rivals Manchester United in 2009. Tevez has scored 43 goals in 63 appearances for City and was a key member of the team that finished third in the English Premier League last season, a position which meant qualification to the European Champions League for the first time in their history. Meanwhile, one player has definitely left City after the club confirmed that Brazilian striker Jo has returned to his native country, signing a permanent deal with Internacional. The 24-year-old was briefly City's record signing when he joined from CSKA Moscow in 2008 for a fee of around $30 million. However, he only scored six goals in 41 matches and has now left the club after loan spells at Everton and Galatasaray. In other transfer news, Galatasaray have confirmed the signing of Lazio goalkeeper Fernando Muslera. The Uruguay number one, currently with Oscar Tabarez's squad in Argentina preparing for Sunday's Copa America final, has signed a five-year deal with Istanbul-based team. The 25-year-old joined Lazio from Montevideo Wanderers in 2007 and has represented Uruguay on 25 occasions. Meanwhile, Brazilian midfielder Denilson has also returned to his homeland after Arsenal agreed to allow the 23-year-old to join former club Sao Paulo on a season-long loan deal. Denilson has played 96 times for Arsenal since making his debut in 2006, scoring seven goals. Another Brazilian on the move is Danilo, who has agreed a switch from Santos to Europa League winners Porto. The young full-back becomes new Porto coach Vitor Pereira's sixth signing of the current transfer window.","Corinthians have pulled out of a deal to sign Carlos Tevez from Manchester City .

"(CNN) -- South Africa risks witnessing mass uprisings if it doesn't act urgently to deal with rampant youth unemployment, the leader of the country's trade union movement has warned. As general secretary of the Congress of South African trade unions (Cosatu), which boasts some two million members, Zwelinzima Vavi's voice is an influential one. Speaking to CNN's Nkepile Mabuse, Vavi warned that 35 years after a youth revolt against the apartheid regime, the country's unemployment levels could lead to a new uprising. ""If we don't do something urgent enough with the crisis of youth unemployment in South Africa we will be in Tunisia and Egypt very soon,"" he said. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: You've warned that South Africa risks another 1976 uprising, tell us what you mean by that? Zwelinzima Vavi: I've participated in the struggle and I know what type of aspirations and hopes all of us carried throughout those many dark years of struggle against apartheid ... I'm only pointing out that after 17 years of all that democracy in the country we've seen little change when it comes to economic freedom, and I normally say we have a political freedom, but the economic jewelry is not hanging on our necks. We have unemployment that I've already described at 36.6%, with 48% of our people living in poverty. We're now number one in the world when it comes to inequalities. I participated in local government elections and I see the face of poverty every day: it's a grinding, humiliating type of poverty that many people will be on the streets demonstrating if they were to be subjected to the same conditions that the poor are subjected to in the country, and already in my view we're seeing an implosion in the country. CNN: Service delivery protests? ZV: You saw the service delivery protest, and having interacted with that thing, I'm of the view that even if we can get the best councilor elected in some of those rural towns, you're not going to get that situation turned around. The crisis is structural; as long as your economy is not put in a new growth path that can absorb large numbers of youth into employment in South Africa, we're sitting with that unemployment. Seventy-three percent of all the people who are unemployed are below the age of 35 -- that's a crisis, that's 1976 waiting to happen again and we've urged that we must address that crisis with the necessary speed and my sense is that more and more South Africans are coming to accept that is true. If we don't do something urgent enough with the crisis of youth unemployment in South Africa we will be in Tunisia and Egypt very soon. CNN: Why do you think there hasn't been urgency within the ruling party to address this issue? ZV: There's been, in my view, a serious lack of political willingness because people are not put under pressure enough. You know when you feel that your tomorrow is guaranteed, your levels of support are guaranteed, you tend to loosen up and the urgency disappears -- that's what's been lacking. CNN: Some analysts would say, if you had it your way, South Africa would not be a business-friendly and investor-friendly environment. ZV: Not true, not true -- I'm a realist, I'm a socialist but (one) who is a realist. I know that 80% of all people employed in the economy of South Africa are employed in the private sector and that demonstrates the extent of the role of the markets, of the private sector, in the South African economy. I wish that was not true, but that is true. I think that sometimes there is an exaggerated, completely misinformed view about the South African labor laws. Lots of people say that they have become too rigid and (are) not creating space for private firms, or it is not an attractive investment destination -- I don't think that is at all true. CNN: Would you ever accept a government job, if it was offered to you again? I understand that when President Jacob Zuma became president you were offered a government position. ZV: Under the conditions of today? No I would not. My basic belief is that we must build a stronger movement of the ANC outside government, capable of holding the leadership to account in every respect. You don't wait for the elections to do correct things, you do them because they are right things to be done every day, which is what I think has become lacking in the country.","Zwelinzima Vavi is general secretary of the Congress of South African trade unions .

"(CNN) -- Paraguay will meet Uruguay in Sunday's Copa America final in Argentina after a dramatic penalty shoot-out win over Venezuela. The 5-3 loss denied Venezuela the chance to reach the final of the Latin American tournament for the first time. The match itself was largely disappointing and finished goal-less, a far cry from the 3-3 thriller played out in the group stages by the same two sides -- Venezuela had come back from 3-1 down. Uruguay books place in final . Venezuela increased the tempo in extra time; twice hitting the woodwork through Maldondo's deflected cross-come-shot and a free-kick from Juan Arango. Meanwhile, Paraguay, twice winners of the competition, were reduced to ten men for the last 20 minutes after Jonathan Santana received his second caution of the match. But still Venezuela could not make the breakthrough. After the match, Venezuela's coach, Cesar Farias, was left to rue his team's ill fortune. ""I don't want to do them down -- but Paraguay were incredibly lucky,"" he said, in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse. ""But we go home with our heads held high. ""They chalked off a goal for us, we hit the woodwork three times and created more chances. We should have won but it didn't work out for us. This is how things go with football and I cannot reproach my players."" Paraguay goalkeeper Justo Villar also conceded fortune had favored his side. ""It's not that we have been practicing penalties -- we've been rather lucky,"" he told AFP. Venezuela will now play Peru, who lost to Uruguay in the other semi-final, for 3rd place.","Paraguay beat Venezuela 5-3 on penalties to reach Copa America final .

"(CNN)    -- Kezai started receiving professional tennis coaching at the age of eight. Since then his father has worked hard to cover his training costs. Two years on and it all seems to have paid off. In June, a local Chengdu company reached out to Li Chengpeng, Kezai's father, with an offer to sponsor Kezai. Soon after, a professional photographer took pictures of Kezai and his father for advertisements. But the family's happiness was short lived. The company withdrew the sponsorship. Though he says he was never given an explanation, Kezai's father believes it was because of his political activity. The company could not be reached for comment. As a controversial blogger and writer, Li announced his plan to run for office as an independent candidate for China's National People's Congress of Wuhou District, a legislative body at the local level in Sichuan province. ""You never know the benefit of standing up if you always stay on your knees,"" Li declared in a campaign statement on his microblog, where he has more than three million regular followers. Through the power of social media, Li's original message was forwarded more than 3,000 times within a few hours on micro-blogging site Sina Weibo, a popular twitter-like service. But such campaigns are rare in China. The Chinese do not choose their own president or premier because all government officials are pre-decided. However, elections are held on the local level, with all candidates approved by the party beforehand. China's electoral law stipulates that every Chinese citizen over 18 has the right to vote and run in local elections. Those, like Li Chengpeng, seeking to become candidates for county or township legislatures must first register and secure confirmation of their candidacy. They must then be nominated as ""deputy candidate"" by political parties, social organizations or have the signed support of at least 10 registered voters in their constituency. In practice, the government can rule candidates or any of their supporters unqualified and refuse to put them on the ballot, which critics say leaves ample opportunity for manipulation of the results. ""I know nobody on the ballot sheet. And I don't think my vote will make much difference,"" a retiree in Beijing said when she was asked to vote for the People's Congress district's last election. In recent months, an unprecedented number of Chinese citizens have declared themselves as independent candidates, according to Li Fan, founder of the World and China Institute that promotes democracy at the local levels. He said many candidates have grievances with the local government and feel they cannot get their voices out. ""They bid for the position as they think they can draw attention from the public for better solving of the problem,"" he said. ""Some local governments did think that their leadership was threatened by these (independent candidates), which is obviously not the case."" Li Fan said. Some believe there are concerns among the central government as well. On June 8, state-run media Xinhua quoted the head of the Commission for Legislative Affairs of the National People's Congress Standing Committee as saying that ""there is no such a thing as an 'independent candidate' as it's not recognized by law."" All candidates must follow the guidelines laid out by the government. But some do manage to meet the guidelines and run under the banner of an independent. The history of China's independent candidates dates back to 1998, when Yao Lifa, a teacher in Hubei Province, became the first self-described independent candidate elected to the local congress. He lost out when attempting a bid for a second term in 2003. With the government in control of the media and potential candidates subject to government approval, many question whether a truly independent candidate can win. Li Fan says more than 100 people -- many using the internet -- have declared themselves as candidates for upcoming elections for people's congresses across the country. ""There are no fair and free elections in China,"" said Li Fan. ""Chances are not good for these people leading the wave, but with their appeals, a lot more people will stand out to join in the election. They are the future."" No matter what the chances are for Li Chengpeng, he says he is determined. ""In China, there is so much unfairness and many choices in life are decided by the others,"" he explained during an interview with CNN. ""I want to make decisions on my own."" To achieve his goal, Li Chengpeng has visited more than 100 residents in his constituency, listening to their appeals to work out his campaign plan, trying to secure the government-required support from 10 registered voters. He also continues to speak out on his blog. Li Chengpeng is not sure whether his name will appear on the ballot in September, when the election process officially begins, but he tries to be optimistic. ""I'm confident. If I'm not confident, how can I convince my supporters?"" he said. Li Chengpeng is not so confident about securing another tennis sponsorship for his son, if his political activities indeed caused him to lose the first one. He says he plans to fight on as an independent -- and he has his son's support.

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Serena Williams will face former winner Maria Sharapova in the fourth round at Wimbledon after both players progressed comfortably on Saturday. World No. 1 Williams thrashed unseeded Slovakian Dominika Cibulkova 6-0 7-5 as she did not lose a game in the opening set for the third successive match. Williams is seeking her fourth title at the grass-court grand slam in England, but said she has yet to find the form of last year despite an ominous start to the two-week tournament. ""I was playing a little better last year, so hopefully I can pick it up -- obviously I'll have to in the next match,"" the American told reporters. ""It's really intense when I play Maria. It's a great match-up and it's good for the tour that she has come back and is playing well. I'll have to play better if I'm to continue to do well. ""I could have played better in the second set today. I stepped off the gas a little too much, and you just can't afford to do that in big grand slams like this."" Sharapova, the 2004 champion, continued her comeback from long-term injury with an error-strewn 7-5 6-3 win over Barbora Zahlavova Strycova of the Czech Republic. The former world No. 1, seeded 16th this year, made 35 unforced errors against a player ranked 68th in the world who has never made it past the third round at Wimbledon. She beat Williams to claim the title as a 17-year-old, but has fallen down the rankings after a difficult past year. ""It'll be a really tough match. She's a defending champion and playing really well,"" the 23-year-old Russian told reporters. The winner of the Williams-Sharapova tie will take on either Polish seventh seed Agnieszka Radwanska or Chinese No. 9 Li Na. Radwanska won 6-3 6-1 against Italian 32nd seed Sara Errani on Saturday, while Na beat Australia-based Russian Anastasia Rodionova 6-1 6-3. Third seed Caroline Wozniacki, who is in the same half of the draw, progressed into the last 16 with a 7-5 6-4 victory over Russian 29th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. The 19-year-old Dane will next face unseeded Czech Petra Kvitova after the 20-year-old knocked out 14th seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus with a 7-5 6-0 victory. Italian 10th seed Flavia Pennetta also exited, losing 6-2 6-3 to Klara Zakopalova. The unseeded Czech will appear in the fourth round of a grand slam for the first time when she takes on Estonia's Kaia Kanepi, who has never before been past the second round at Wimbledon.","Defending champion Serena Williams cruises into the fourth round at Wimbledon .

"(CNN) -- Park Ji-Sung will sign a new two-year contract with Manchester United, according to the English football champions' manager Alex Ferguson. The midfielder, 30, has one year remaining on his current deal, but Ferguson is confident the former South Korea star will commit his future to the club he joined from Dutch outfit PSV Eindhoven in 2005. ""He's been offered a new contract, yes,"" Ferguson, 69, told the Old Trafford team's official web site. ""I'm sure he'll sign it. His career at United has been nothing but excellent.

"(CNN) -- Samuel Sanchez finally won his first stage at the Tour de France on Thursday, but the title hopes of his fellow Spanish cyclist Alberto Contador suffered a surprise blow as the race headed into the mountains. Sanchez was fourth in the sport's biggest event last year, but found himself more than five minutes behind leader Thomas Voeckler going into the 12th leg from Cugnaux to Luz Ardiden. However, the 2008 Olympic road race champion sped clear of the bunch of escaped riders going into the final ascent along with Jelle Vanendert, and the 33-year-old held off the Belgian for a memorable victory by seven seconds in the Pyrenees. It came almost 10 years after his Basque-based Euskaltel team's first stage win at Le Tour, also at Luz Ardiden. Cavendish sprints to third win of 2011 Tour de France . ""I knew it was an important day, and I had to try something because I was late to my position in the general classification meant that I was not a dangerous rival for some of the GC riders,"" Sanchez told the race website. ""I had my chance and I decided to go. I was also aware that Andy Schleck had lost a lot of teammates and so did Alberto Contador, so they were not able to reel in our escape."" Sanchez came in 50 seconds ahead of Voeckler, who retained the yellow jersey after placing ninth. Defending Contador, seeking a fourth title, was eighth as he lost time on his main rivals to be four minutes adrift overall with nine stages left. ""I had a really sore knee, it was bothering me so I'm happy with the result even if I did concede a few seconds. I couldn't do any better,"" he said. ""I've been feeling the effects of those crashes in the first week, my pedal stroke hasn't been great. But I'm sure things are going to improve. The engine is taking some time to warm up but I think everyone is feeling tired and I hope that will play to my advantage."" Voeckler kept his lead of one minute and 49 seconds, though Luxembourg's Frank Schleck moved up to second place as he finished third -- 10 seconds behind Sanchez. Two-time runner-up Cadel Evans of Australia was 30 seconds behind the winner in fifth to be third overall, 2:06 behind Voeckler. Andy Schleck, who lost out to Contador last year after a controversial chain-break incident, was left 2:17 adrift after finishing sixth in the same time as Evans and Italy's Ivan Basso, who was fifth overall with a deficit of 3:16. Voeckler was happy after keeping pace with the stage leaders until 1,800 meters from the end. ""I was a little bit afraid when I crashed at the top of the first climb. I'm normally not so bad in the downhill but I was very scared this time. The road was very slippery and I decided to change my bike and that helped,"" said the Frenchman, who has held the maillot jaune since finishing second in stage nine. ""On the final climb, I was still in the race along with the best climbers. I told myself, 'Keep going! Keep going!' And Pierre Rolland gave me a great hand in the final -- he really helped me. My legs felt good but it was the great job done by the Europcar team that really helped me today."" Thursday's stage winner Mark Cavendish was more than half an hour off the pace in 153rd, but retained the sprinters' green jersey as he extended his lead to 18 points from Spain's Jose Joaquin Rojas. Sanchez won the climbers' polka-dot jersey for King of the Mountains, while the Schlecks' Leopard-Trek lead the teams. Friday's 13th stage is a 152.5-kilometer route from Pau to Lourdes, featuring a steep climb up the 1,709-meter Col d'Aubisque.","Three-time Tour de France winner Alberto Contador now four minutes off leader's time .
