"A labyrinth of secret underground tunnels believed to have been used by the Nazis to develop a nuclear bomb has been uncovered. The facility, which covers an area of up to 75 acres, was discovered near the town of St Georgen an der Gusen, Austria last week, it has been reported. Excavations began on the site after researchers detected heightened levels of radiation in the area - supporting claims that the Nazis were developing nuclear weapons. Scroll down for video .

Significant: Documentary maker Andreas Sulzer, who is leading the excavations, said that the site is 'most likely the biggest secret weapons production facility of the Third Reich. Above, B8 Bergkristall . Documentary maker Andreas Sulzer, who is leading the excavations, told the Sunday Times that the site is 'most likely the biggest secret weapons production facility of the Third Reich'. It is believed to be connected to the B8 Bergkristall underground factory, where the Messerschmitt Me 262 - the first operational jet fighter - was built. There are also suggestions that the complex is connected to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. Slave labour from the camp was used to build both complexes - with as many as 320,000 inmates in the harsh underground conditions. But while the Bergkristall site was explored by Allied and Russia after the war, the Nazis appeared to have gone through greater lengths to conceal the newly-discovered tunnels. Its entrance was only uncovered after the excavation team, which includes historians and scientists, pieced together information in declassified intelligence documents and testimonies from witnesses. Hidden: While the nearby Bergkristall site was explored by Allied and Russian forces after the war, the Nazis appeared to have gone through greater lengths to conceal the newly-discovered tunnels near St Georgen . Military centre: The newly-discovered site is believed to be connected to the B8 Bergkristall underground factory, pictured above, where the Messerschmitt Me 262 - the first operational jet fighter - was built . Development: While the Bergkristall site, pictured above, was explored by Allied and Russia after the war, the Nazis appeared to have gone through greater lengths to conceal the newly-discovered tunnels . The team is now in the process of removing layers of soil and concrete packed into the tunnels and heavy granite plates that were used to cover the entrance. Helmets belonging to SS troops and other Nazi relics are among the items that have been uncovered so far. The excavation was halted last week by police, who demanded the group produce a permit for conducting research on historic sites. But Mr Sulzer is confident that work will resume next month. He told the Sunday Times: 'Prisoners from concentration camps across Europe were handpicked for their special skills - physicists, chemists or other experts - to work on this monstrous project and we owe it to the victims to finally open the site and reveal the truth.' The probe was triggered by a research documentary by Mr Sulzer on Hitler's quest to build an atomic bomb. In it, he referenced diary entries from a physicist called up to work for the Nazis. There is other evidence of scientists working for a secret project managed by SS General Hans Kammler. Kammler, who signed off the plans for the gas chambers and crematorium at Auschwitz, was in charge of Hitler's missile programmes. Mr Sulzer searched archives in Germany, Moscow and America for evidence of the  nuclear weapons-building project led by the SS. He discovered that on January 2, 1944, some 272 inmates of Mauthausen were taken from the camp to St Georgen to begin the construction of secret galleries. By November that year, 20,000 out of 40,000 slave labourers drafted in to build the tunnels had been worked to death. After the war, Austria spent some £10million in pouring concrete into most of the tunnels. But Sulzer and his backers believe they missed a secret section where the atomic research was conducted. Brutal: Slave labour from Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp (pictured) was used to build both the St Georgen site and Bergkristall with as many as 320,000 inmates in the harsh underground conditions . The Soviets were stationed in St Georgen until 1955 and they took all of the files on the site back with them to Moscow. Experts are trying to discover if there is a link between St Georgen and sites in Germany proper where scientists were assembled during the Third Reich in a bid to match American efforts to build the ultimate weapon. In June 2011, atomic waste from Hitler's secret nuclear programme was believed to have been found in an old mine near Hanover. More than 126,000 barrels of nuclear material lie rotting over 2,000 feet below ground in an old salt mine. Rumour has it that the remains of nuclear scientists who worked on the Nazi programme are also there, their irradiated bodies burned in secret by S.S. men sworn to secrecy.","Facility was discovered near the town of St Georgen an der Gusen, Austria .

"An actress who stripped naked, put a pot on her head and walked along the street with a kitchen knife and meat cleaver told police she was rehearsing for a role in a new play. Elena Yegorova, 45, was spotted without her clothes on and she limped down a street outside her home in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev by worried neighbours who called the police. When officers arrived she told them she was going to do a stage production of the film Dawn of the Dead, in which flesh-eating zombies take over America. Scroll down for video . Elena Yegorova, 45, was spotted walking down a street without her clothes on, a pot on her head and clutching a meat cleaver and a kitchen knife . A spokesman from the force said: 'She explained she wanted to get into character and had read somewhere that zombies can't see very well and are guided by scent, so she had put the pot on her head to make visibility difficult. 'She then said she was planning to get other actors and actresses to do the same when preparing for their roles,' they said. 'We told her that wasn't a good idea.' Neighbour, Ignat Galkin, 33,  who captured the bizarre scene on her mobile phone said: 'It is probably the weirdest thing I have ever seen. 'She was completely starkers, walking in a straight line, muttering something to herself and holding a knife in one hand and a meat cleaver in the other. When officers arrived Yegorova told them she was going to do a stage production of the film Dawn of the Dead, in which flesh-eating zombies take over America . A worried neighbour, who called the police, filmed the incident and said she was concerned she might harm herself or someone else. But Yegorova said she was simply trying to get into the role . 'I thought she was clearly off her rocker and how she managed to see where she was going I have no idea. 'But I was worried that she might harm someone or herself so I called the police.' Ms Yegorova told local media: 'I believe that as an actress I have a responsibility to my audience to bring as much authenticity to the role as possible.'","Elena Yegorova, 45, was seen limping down road near her home in Kiev .

"An image being shared by the NYPD supposedly showing uniformed officers gathering for the funeral of Rafael Ramos was actually taken in 2007. The picture posted on Twitter by many of the department's precincts was actually taken from coverage of the funeral of Russel Timoshenko rather than of the thousands of officers who gathered in Queens on Saturday. The tweet uploaded by the 72nd Precinct read: 'Over 20,000 police officers pay their final respect to Detective 1st Grade Ramos.' The tweet uploaded by many of the NYPD's precincts, including the 72nd, actually showed crowds gathered for the 2007 funeral of Russel Timoshenko, rather than those gathered to pay their respects to Rafael Ramos . Another posted by the 34th read: 'To all who traveled or sent condolences for Officer Ramos. Thank you. Your support is overwhelming, and inspiring.' Timoshenko, 23, was shot and killed after pulling over a stolen BMW in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. It first appeared in a New York Times article covering the service for the Belorussian immigrant who died when he was in his second year on the job. His funeral in Flatbush Avenue in the Flatlands was attended by 10,000 people. The NYPD Commissioner at the time, Raymond W. Kelly said in his eulogy: 'Russel was a remarkable young man, Disciplined, ambitious, enthusiastic, inspired by love of his new country, motivated to serve his beloved city, and dedicated to the mission of the New York City Police Department.' On Saturday, tens of thousands of police from cities across the United States arrived in New York and lined the streets to pay respect to Ramos, 40, who was murdered alongside his partner Wenjian Liu last week. A number of dignitaries including Joe Biden, former New York mayor Rudy Guiliani and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton. Embattled Mayor Bill de Blasio also made a speech during the service, during which officers turned their back as it was shown on the big screen. Many have criticized his dealing of the protests in New York City this month.

Those at the vigil today included Spike Grant, 51, who crossed the road just before the crash on Monday. He said: 'We were there on the day and had just crossed the road. It was like firecrackers going off. We turned to look and saw the lorry coming up with debris flying off the back. 'I went back and helped a doctor with a young girl, a lassie who was 14 and is still in hospital. 'Half a second earlier and it could have been us. We just wanted to come down today to pay our respects.' A young woman adds her lit candle to the hundreds currently in place in George Square to remember those who died on Monday .

David McCallum, 21, who runs the Support the George Square Crash page, set up a similar page following the Clutha helicopter crash in November 2013, which left ten people dead. Mr McCallum said: 'I didn't know any of the victims personally but I made a Clutha support page last year and that got such a good response with a lot of people saying it had helped them so I wanted to do the same for this. 'I just like the idea of everyone coming together - if this helps anyone come to terms with it and deal with it and helps then I think it is worth doing. 'The turnout has been amazing. It's unreal, considering that it's the Sunday before New Year and after Christmas when people have go so many other things to do and yet they're taking the time to come here for an hour to show their support.

'It's been a good tribute to those affected by the tragedy.' Pensioner Ann Wood, 70, from Glasgow, said she also wanted to lay flowers and pay her respects. She said: 'I just wanted to show my respect to those who died and express my sympathy for the people affected. 'The turnout has really shown that Glasgow people do stick together through it all. 'When I first heard I thought it was simply terrible. I couldn't even believe it at the time because you just don't expect something like that to happen so close to Christmas. 'But the response and turnout from everyone has been brilliant. Glasgow knows how to come together when there's a crisis. 'The last time I saw as many tributes as this was when Princess Diana died. 'It's even bigger than the tributes laid after the Clutha, it's that terrible.'

"Scotland Yard has been handed the names of two more former Government ministers accused of sexually abusing children. Campaigning MP John Mann said he was approached last week by a victim who claims to have been abused by the politicians – one a peer – in the 1980s and has passed the detailed allegations to detectives. The latest phase in his search for the truth about a suspected Westminster child sex ring came as he called for retired detectives to be granted an unprecedented amnesty from the Official Secrets Act to help lift the lid on alleged VIP abusers. Scroll down for video . Another two former ministers have been named in allegations of sexual abuse of children by Westminster VIPs in the 1980s. Above, the Dolphin Square apartment complex where much of the abuse is alleged to have taken place . Allowing former Special Branch officers who witnessed the alleged events to speak out could be central to bringing prosecutions, said Mr Mann. He has now called on Home Secretary Theresa May to lift Official Secrets Act restrictions. The new allegations of child abuse emerged after the Bassetlaw MP handed a carefully-researched dossier about five paedophile rings to police with the names of 22 MPs. It includes 13 ex-ministers, at least two of whom are claimed to have gone to 'abuse parties' held at Dolphin Square, the luxury riverside estate in Pimlico which has been home to dozens of MPs. However, Mr Mann said the latest claims, which involve two former politicians who are still alive, are 'entirely separate'. 'Someone has contacted me with some very precise allegations – not just the names but the basis of the allegations – and it is going straight to the police,' he said. He said the key to unlocking the truth behind the saga lies with retired Special Branch detectives who witnessed events and could be 'absolutely critical' in providing information to an investigation. He said 'a number' of officers have contacted him, including one who has read a 50-page dossier of evidence amassed by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens which is now said to be missing. He added: 'It is clear there are a lot of people who could provide a lot of information, potentially vital information, to support ongoing criminal investigations. 'But they are not doing so because of the Official Secrets Act. They are fearful of not only breaking the law but the potential effect on their pension. This is absolutely crucial if we are to get some of these ex-officers coming forward and to get prosecutions of some of the former MPs.' Labour MP John Mann made has handed a dossier of information to Scotland Yard . Scotland Yard is already investigating sweeping allegations made by one man who claims he suffered systematic and organised abuse over nine years until 1984. They want to trace witnesses to corroborate his astonishing claim that three boys were murdered by a sex ring that operated in London and the Home Counties. Mrs May has already said the Official Secrets Act 'should not get in the way' of anybody giving evidence to an official inquiry. But campaigners say the offer does not go far enough and want a guaranteed amnesty. Those who sign the Act could face up to 14 years in prison if they breach it by revealing sensitive information, which could include the movements of top politicians. One former Special Branch detective, now aged 81, said he was 'shocked and surprised' to be contacted out of the blue and warned not to speak out about disgraced Liberal MP Cyril Smith. Tony Robinson, who claimed to have found files relating to the MP 'deliberately hidden' in a safe in Preston in the early 1970s, said he was told by his 'old HQ' the information was still protected by the Official Secrets Act. The Government is under huge pressure to put its ill-fated child sex abuse inquiry back on track after two panel chairmen stepped down over potential conflicts of interest. A meeting involving more than 100 people including alleged victims will be held on January 14. The man at the centre of the Dolphin Square inquiry says he was abused at depraved sex 'parties' from the age of seven. Known only by the pseudonym Nick, he claims to have witnessed horrific acts at the luxury estate in central London between 1975 and 1984. After being abused by his father, Nick says he was handed to a gang of top Establishment figures. He has described being driven by a chauffeur, along with a terrified 12-year-old boy, to a luxury townhouse where he watched as a Tory MP strangled the other child. Nick also said he saw a second boy being brutally murdered in front of a Tory Cabinet minister in 1981. A third boy, aged ten or 11, had died in 1979 after being deliberately run over by a member of the paedophile gang in a 'warning' to victims not to speak out, he alleges. He says he was taken to Dolphin Square at least ten times for 'abuse parties'. He claimed one MP told him to thrash another boy - and 'sexually punished' him when he refused. After receiving counselling he contacted the investigative website Exaro in May, whose investigators described him as 'intelligent and articulate', before going to the police.

"Former Home Secretary David Blunkett has admitted he would find it tough if Roma gipsies moved into his own street . Former Home Secretary David Blunkett has admitted he would find it tough if Roma gipsies moved into his own street – 10 years after he opened Britain's borders to new EU members. The Labour politician allowed migrants from Poland, Slovakia and Hungary to work in Britain from 2004, resulting in one of the biggest waves of immigration ever seen in the UK. More than one million workers from Eastern Europe arrived between 2004 and the end of 2009 – many of them settling in his home city of Sheffield. He warned that the influx of Roma migrants would result in riots in British cities last year and suggested they should 'change their culture' as it was causing tensions. Now as he prepares to live out his retirement in Sheffield, Mr Blunkett, 67, has said he would be distraught if  gypsies moved into his street. 'I would find it a challenge because of the way of life they are used to. The deprivation in Slovakia was awful. We've got to say it isn't awful here and your behaviour has to change,' he told the Sun on Sunday. Despite this, the MP for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough insisted it was not a mistake to open the UK's borders to Eastern Europe 10 years ago. 'The only regret I have about 2004 is not to put more time and cash into helping communities cope with that massive change,' he said. 'It wasn't a deliberate policy of 'Let's open the doors and have a massive flood'. 'Did we make mistakes? Yes. We should never have condoned the predictions it was going to be tens of thousands coming to Britain when, over the next four years, it turned out to be hundreds of thousands.' The last Labour government predicted that only 13,000 would move to Britain from Poland and other eastern European countries after 2004, when in fact it was more than one million. Mr Blunkett said Britain must wake up to the fact it cannot close its borders and pointed out the country has always been built on inward migration. The Labour politician, pictured with his dog Sadie, allowed migrants from Poland, Slovakia and Hungary to work in Britain from 2004, resulting in one of the biggest waves of immigration ever seen in the UK . Mr Blunkett chats to former Labour leader Neil Kinnock before the start of the Party Conference in 1986 . 'Ukip leader Nigel Farage's wife is German, for goodness sake,' he said. He blames the rise of Ukip and the Scottish National Party for splitting the vote and weakening traditional Labour support. The Labour politician insisted he has no regrets at his decision to stand down from Parliament at the next general election. He described Prime Minister's Questions as a 'bear pit' and said he wouldn't miss it at all. Mr Blunkett, who served as education secretary, home secretary and work and pension secretary under former prime minister Tony Blair, said the Labour leadership wanted to make a 'clear break with the past'. Tensions between Roma migrants and locals came to a head in May this year when more than 25 people were involved in the mass disturbance in Sheffield . He became the youngest ever leader of Sheffield City Council in 1980, before he was elected as an MP and was later appointed as education secretary in 1997, following the landslide election victory for New Labour. The Labour politician resigned from cabinet posts twice - the first time in 2004 as home secretary after a visa application for ex-lover Kimberly Quinn's nanny was fast-tracked. An official inquiry found a 'chain of events' linking Mr Blunkett's office to the speeding up of a visa application. Less than 12 months later he stepped down as work and pensions secretary, following a row over his business interests. The MP, who was born blind, has said one of his greatest successes has been breaking down barriers for people with disabilities.","David Blunkett said he was find it tough if Roma gipsies lived in his street .

"Paranoid schizophrenic Harry Street, 70, originally called Barry Williams, had a fatal heart attack at high-security Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside . A mass killer who gunned down five people in a one-day 'orgy of terror' and then planned another rampage when he was freed has died behind bars. Paranoid schizophrenic Harry Street, 70, originally called Barry Williams, had a fatal heart attack at high-security Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside on Christmas Eve. The gun fanatic opened fire on three neighbours in 1978 following a long-running dispute over noise and then killed an elderly couple at a petrol station in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. He was detained indefinitely in Broadmoor after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility in March 1979 – but was released just 15 years later. Last year it emerged that neighbours Warren and Sharee Smith complained to police about a five-year campaign of harassment which had chilling similarity to the dispute decades earlier. When police raided the Birmingham home Street shared with wife Beverley and daughter Amy, 18, they found six guns, a homemade bomb and more than 50 bullets. He was again detained indefinitely by a judge who said a tragedy had been missed by only a 'narrow margin' and Street threatened to blow up Mr Smith's family after his release. Mr Smith told the Sunday Mirror: 'I feel shock but also relief. He was a very clever guy - he played the system and serious mistakes have been made. 'We actually got on well with his wife and daughter, and I do feel sorry for them. We were very, very lucky as I know that something was about to happen before his arrest.' He spoke of his anger that the killer had been allowed to change his name and that police had no idea of the dangerous history of their 'nuisance neighbour'. Street went on a rampage in 1978 killing neighbours George Burkitt, 48, his wife Iris Burkitt, 47, and their 20-year-old son Philip after a day out drinking whisky. The couple's teenage daughter, Jill Burkitt, who was 17 at the time, was left with serious gun wounds after she was hit in the back and thigh by five bullets at her West Bromwich home. The gun fanatic's merciless killing spree in 1978 claimed five lives and prompted front-page headlines which shocked Britain . After hearing Street had died, Ms Burkitt told The Sun on Sunday: 'The devil has gone back to hell. 'It was always my fear that one day he'd be released again and hunt me down. 'No one likes to hear of anyone dying but in his case it was best.' It emerged that Street, then aged 34, had a firearms certificate for a semi-automatic weapon he used legitimately at gun club ranges after the shootings in 1978. Following his arrest by officers who overpowered him, more than 900 live bullet cartridges and a 0.22-calibre pistol were found stashed inside Street's Ford Capri. Two charges of attempted murder were ordered to lie on the file by a judge at Stafford Crown Court in March 1979, who described Street's crimes as a 'dreadful series of events' driven by mental illness. He was detained under mental health laws in 1979 for the manslaughters, but was released 15 years later . Psychiatric experts told the court Street had an active paranoid psychosis requiring hospital treatment. Street's release, after he was deemed safe to be returned to the community, also attracted significant media attention. A decision in 1994 to allow him to live in a bail hostel around six miles away from the scene of the West Bromwich shootings was described as 'crass, insensitive and dangerous' by a local MP. One of Street's original victims also voiced anger at the decision to free Street. George Burkitt (right), his wife Iris (left) were both shot in the head, while their son Philip was shot through the heart . Speaking to a newspaper in 2003, Judith Chambers, who survived being struck by two bullets, warned that Street may one day attempt to repeat his slaughter. Referring to her attacker by his original surname, she told the Sunday Mercury: 'One of my fears is that one day he will decide to come back to Birmingham and finish the job off. If he ever got his hands on another gun, I dread to think what the consequences might be. 'Some day, someone will be sorry that Williams was let out.' It was only after Street's arrest on October 14 last year that police discovered his real identity was mass killer Barry Williams. Prosecutor Michael Duck QC told Birmingham Crown Court officers found six guns and an explosive device in a cupboard at the pensioner's home. The serial killer adapted blank firing weapons and built homemade bullets before testing his fguns by firing them at an Argos catalogue from close range. Street killed Michel and Lisa Di Maria (left), an Italian-born couple who ran a petrol station and  Philip Burkitt (right) Mr Duck said: 'Officers searched the premises at Hazelville Road and the results of that search were in the context of this case, revealing and frightening. 'The methodology mirrored what he did in 1978. Of course, having discovered those items, there was further investigation into Harry Street and the reality of him having been Barry Williams in 1978 then emerged.' Sentencing Street to be detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act, Mr Justice Blair said: 'The effect of these orders is that the defendant may never be released.' The judge added that the risk of a further tragedy had only been 'narrowly avoided' and a serious case review is due to be released in January. A spokesperson for Ashworth Hospital said: 'A patient in our long term care was taken to general hospital after becoming acutely physically unwell. He did die.' He attacked the family on Andrew Road, the Bustleholm estate (pictured) and then drove to a petrol station and killed an elderly couple . In 2007 Street became obsessed with his neighbours the Smiths, pictured is Warren Smith  arriving at Birmingham Crown Court with his daughter Shaneze . When police raided Street's Birmingham home they found six guns, a homemade bomb and more than 50 bullets . October 26, 1978 - Barry Williams guns down the Burkitt family, killing Iris and George and their son Phillip and leaving their daughter Jill serious wounded at around 7.10pm. October 26, 1978 - He pulls up to service station in Arbury Road, Nuneaton, Warwickshire, and walks up to the kiosk before shooting Mike Di Maria and his wife Liza at around 8.10pm. October 27, 1978 - Williams is finally overpowered and arrested by officers after a car chase in Buxton, Derbyshire. March 26, 1979 - The killer is sent to Broadmoor for killing five people after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. October 1994 - He is released from Broadmoor and found to be living just six miles away from the scene of the massacre to public outcry. He then moves to Wales, marries and has a daughter before returning to Birmingham as Harry Street. 2007 - Street becomes obsessed with his neighbours the Smith family and starts to harbour delusions they are harassing him. October 14, 2013 - Police investigating allegations of harassment by Street find firearms and explosives at his home in Hazelville Road, Hall Green. The bomb squad is called in to recover IEDs and weapons. October 6, 2014 - Street is detained indefinitely at the high-security Ashworth psychiatric hospital in Liverpool after admitting three charges of possessing a firearm, one charge of harassment and one of making an explosive device.","Harry Street, originally called Barry Williams, shot dead five people in 1978 .

"They are more likely to be well off, in good health and enjoy a long retirement. So perhaps it is no surprise that the baby-boom generation has settled in one of the most picturesque parts of the county. A corner of South Devon has been named as the baby boomer capital of Britain, with a third of residents in the South Hams area aged between 50 and 68. Situated in an area of outstanding natural beauty, the district is popular with tourists and sought-after among wealthy city dwellers looking for second homes and older people hoping to downsize or retire to the countryside. With a third of residents in the South Hams area aged between 50 and 68, it's the baby boomer capital of Britain. Pictured, the River Avon's estuary in South Hams . Nestled among the rolling countryside and sandy beaches are the towns of Salcombe and Dartmouth, as well as Totnes and Ivybridge, which borders Dartmoor. Research published today shows that the South West has the greatest number of residents aged between 50 and 68, with seven of the top 20 areas located in Devon, Dorset or Somerset. West Somerset is in second place and Torridge in Devon is the next most highly ranked in sixth place. East Lindsey in Lincolnshire, home to Skegness and Horncastle, comes in third place and North Norfolk, fourth. Northern hotspots in the research by pensions group Aegon include South Lakeland – which takes in Kendal and much of the Lake District – and Ryedale, North Yorkshire. The only Scottish area to make the list is Argyll and Bute in 13th place. The mountainous Welsh region of Powys comes in at number 20. The area with the lowest number of boomers is the London borough of Tower Hamlets, where they make up just 10 per cent of the population. Eight out of the bottom ten districts are in London, the other two being Manchester and Oxford. There are 14million baby boomers in Britain, according to the Office for National Statistics, accounting for 22 per cent of the population. The research was carried out because 2014 is the year in which the last of the generation turns 50. Many of those living in the hotspots also have long life expectancy. The figures show that those aged 65 in South Hams can expect to live for another 21 years on average. Across the top 20, the average life expectancy at 65 is another 20.5 years. David Macmillan, of Aegon, said: ‘One of the main features of this group is their economic clout, with much of the nation’s wealth concentrated in the hands of a generation that by and large benefited from stable economic conditions, rising property values and defined benefit pensions. ‘Baby boomers are also much healthier so they can expect to enjoy a long retirement.’","Corner of South Devon named as the baby boomer capital of Britain .

"Al Qaeda has called for a new generation of ‘lone wolf’ terrorists to blow up easyJet and British Airways planes using bombs made in their kitchens. The chilling call to arms in the terror group’s online magazine says the airlines should be targeted to gain headlines and ‘crush the enemy’s economy’. Released on Christmas Eve, the edition of Inspire names BA because it is the ‘flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom’ and the largest airline by number of planes. Scroll down for video . Chilling:  Al-Qaeda's house magazine (above) calls for high-profile airlines including British Airways, easyJet, AA, Delta and United to be targeted by bombers to 'crush the enemy's economy'. Police are investigating . Targets: The sick magazine picks out British Airways and easyJet as targets for would-be terrorists . EasyJet is considered a good target because it ‘is a low cost carrier, hence has a large number of passengers’. Air France and US carriers American Airlines, United, Continental and Delta are also named, alongside high-profile American figures Bill Gates and former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. The article praises Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called ‘underpants bomber’ jailed for life in the US in 2012 after he tried to bomb a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. The 300 passengers were saved partly because the bomb sewn into his underwear failed to detonate fully, prosecutors said at the time. The latest edition of the magazine contains supposed instructions for would-be suicide bombers who want to bypass airport security. It has been published four years after the first issue of Inspire contained a notorious explosives guide entitled Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom. It was suspected to have been the template for explosives which killed three and injured more than 250 in last year’s Boston marathon bombings. American Airlines, United, Continental and Delta are also named in the magazine - despite the fact that Continental Airlines stopped flying planes under its name two years ago after merging with United . Journal: The magazine has been connected to the Boston Marathon bombings in April last year . Its author, known only as the ‘Al Qaeda chef’, was re-interviewed this week as the magazine claimed the attacks were a ‘natural reaction’ to the ‘arrogance’ of the US. He said the ‘first priority’ for any of his terrorists would be the US, ‘then the United Kingdom, then France and so on’. And he called for the rise of the ‘lone wolf’ jihadist, saying: ‘It is hard to uncover, because none knows him but Allah. He has no relationship with any group or any individuals.’ The magazine also praised an axe attack on a group of policemen in New York in October as a ‘splendid’ example of a ‘lone wolf’. US navy veteran Zale Thompson was shot dead in the street after the brutal hatchet attack, which the FBI confirmed last month it was considering as an act of terror. FBI director James Comey said Thompson had been watching Islamic State beheading videos and other radical jihadist material online, adding there is ‘no doubt that played a role’ in the attack. Shock tactics: The magazine includes images of an airport departures board and, on its cover, a jumbo jet . Inspire is published by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based primarily in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Its possession has led to arrests of potential terrorists in Britain. Four men were jailed for a combined 44 years in April 2013 after a court heard they had planned to follow instructions in the magazine to carry out an attack in Luton using a toy car. Other terrorists were convicted under section 58 of the 2000 Terror Act solely for possessing the magazine. Those who are found guilty can be jailed for up to ten years. A British Airways spokesman said: ‘The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority. ‘We continue to work closely with airports and governments around the world.’ He added: ‘We never comment on matters of security.’ An easyJet spokesman said: ‘The safety and security of our passengers and crew is always our highest priority. We are unable to comment further on matters of security.’ Growing fears of a plot to launch a ‘lone wolf’ terror attack have led to royal guards being moved behind metal gates at palaces. For the first time since the height of IRA terrorism, most of the soldiers of the Queen’s Guard are no longer allowed on sentry duty alone. The move comes after Islamic terrorists called on their followers to target British police officers and those on ceremonial duties. At Clarence House, the official residence of Prince Charles, guardsmen have been relocated behind metal gates on The Mall. At St James’s Palace, the London home of Princesses Anne, Beatrice and Eugenie, two sentry boxes have been moved into a courtyard which cannot be seen from the public gate. In Horse Guards Parade, two guards have been joined by four police officers carrying Heckler and Koch carbine rifles, pistols and Tasers. And up to three armed officers now stand next to the lone sentry on the western side of Windsor Castle. The Metropolitan Police and Buckingham Palace said they do not comment on security matters. The Ministry of Defence said: ‘We routinely review security arrangements.’","Terrorists' journal Inspire calls for 'hidden bomb' attacks on planes .

Douglas Cole says at least two people were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, reported Action 4 News. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Madness: Cell phone footage shows scores of teens fighting with one another at the Pennsylvania mall . Cole says large groups of teens began showing up around 5 p.m., with the crowds swelling to as many as 1,000, according to mall security officers. Cole says he doesn't believe it was an organized event or protest and that it's unclear as to why the teens were congregating at the mall or fighting with one another. Monroeville Police Chief Doug Cole said, 'It appeared to be no set type of protest it was just that there were many juveniles.' Employees say stores closed early after fights were reported around 8 p.m. Cole reports minor damage to the mall, including to kiosks. Cole says he expects officers to issue disorderly conduct citations. He says two arrests for fighting were related to an earlier domestic dispute.

"When you're spending the night alone in a hotel room, a creepy note and a locked door are probably the worst things you could find. And the mysterious note Amy Jones found in the drawer of her Edinburgh hotel room is like something straight out of a horror movie. Her Christmas present was a visit to the Scottish capital as a break from her final year of university student, but things took a scary turn when she found the message. And when the 21-year-old journalism student posted a picture of it on Twitter, it quickly sparked a frenzy and began to trend. Amy Jones, left, found a creepy note in her Edinburgh hotel room, which she posted on Twitter, right . She wrote: 'So I'm in a hotel in Edinburgh and I've just found this note in one of the drawers...' And accompanying her tweet was a picture of the note, which said 'Don't open the locked door! Don't trust its whispers! Leave, just lea [sic]' She followed it up with a picture of the door, captioned: 'This is the door they are referring to. It faces my bed. Cool.' Amy, from Salford, told MailOnline: 'I was so amused when I saw the note though a little shocked. 'I showed my mum and we thought it must be kids having a laugh.' She added: 'It is so funny.

"Born with no right arm below the elbow, it was hard for little Charlie Egan to embrace the festive spirit. Unwrapping presents was a struggle, and then there were the constant questions from others about his missing limb to contend with. But the five year old can get to grips with Christmas with gusto this year - thanks to his new ‘Spiderman’ prosthetic arm printed from a 3D machine. Charlie is thought to be the first child in the UK to be fitted with an arm made with the revolutionary printing technology. Scroll down for video . Charlie Egan, five, was born with no right arm past the elbow but he's now been fitted with a prosthetic limb made using a 3D printer . It was specially designed for him in red and blue, the colours of his favourite superhero Spider-Man, has a Spider-Man web motif and arrived just in time for the start of the festivities. He has used it to help decorate the tree, and it means he can now ride his scooter. But just as importantly, having a superhero arm is helping Charlie fit in with his peers. His mother Penny Egan said: ‘It will change his life. He has to deal with negative comments about people asking what happened to his arm, and staring at him every day of his life. ‘Instead of saying what happened, now people say, Wow, you have a superhero arm. ‘Charlie is thrilled with it. He can’t stop smiling.’ Mrs Egan, 34, and husband David, 32, an engineer sought help from US-based E-nable, a network of volunteers who design and make prosthetics mainly for children. The prosthetic, fitted in time for Christmas, means Charlie, pictured with his mother Penny Egan, was properly able to get to grips with his gifts this year . Mrs Egan, pictured left, and husband David, 32, an engineer sought help from US-based E-nable, a network of volunteers who design and make prosthetics mainly for children . Charlie’s arm was designed from a plaster cast made by his parents. The Baltimore network of engineers and academics designed the arm before having it made using a 3D printer based in London. It is strapped to his arm with Velcro, and when he flexes his elbow it causes the fingers to close and grip. E-nable’s members include engineers, artists and university academics who donate their expertise and time for free. 3D printing has been described as the ‘future of manufacturing’. Earlier this year doctors used it to replace a patient’s hip in one of the first operations of its kind in the UK, and Hayley Fraser, five, from Inverness, was recently fitted with a prosthetic hand made with 3D technology. It was at Mrs Egan’s 20 week pregnancy scan that doctors first realised there was anything wrong with Charlie. Mrs Egan, of Lowestoft, Norwich, said: ‘It was a massive shock to us when we found out. There was no explanation for why it had happened in the womb, I was told it was just one of those things.’ Charlie had an NHS prosthetic arm fitted at six months old, to help him balance when he crawled, but he preferred to try without it. He's thought to be the first child in the UK to have an arm made with the revolutionary printing technology . Mrs Egan said: ‘He never used his prosthetic arm that he had when he was a baby, and he managed fine without it. He learnt to crawl and walk just like any other baby, to him it was just like a dolly’s arm. ‘When he was a baby he just played with his plastic arm just like he would do a toy, then as he grew into a toddler he ignored it. ‘He never needed anything else, he just adapted to doing things without any proper hands. He managed wonderfully well. ‘He could feed himself and climb to the top of a climbing frame with all his friends. He can even play computer games and controls the small buttons with the end of his arm.’ Then two months ago Mrs Egan heard about E-nable, based in Baltimore, USA. She said: ‘I went on their website and I had to send photos of Charlie and his measurements. Then we were matched with someone locally down in London who had a 3-D printer.’ The couple had to provide him with the measurements and a design was drawn up. Then it was printed off the printer. Mrs Egan said: ‘Charlie has always managed really well, but now he can feel more like the other children now that he’s got his new hand.’","Charlie Egan, from Suffolk, was born with no right arm below the elbow .

"An Illinois professor set out to disprove the age old presumption that the relentless stress of America's top job makes our Commander-in-Chiefs age in fast-forward. The conclusion: President Obama, like most presidents, is aging no differently from the rest of us. 'It's just a misconception,' S. Jay Olshansky, a public health professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told the Los Angeles Times. In fact, technology Olshansky used to analyze the fine lines, wrinkles and age spots of Obama's famous face indicates the current president registers slightly younger than his 53 years. Spot the difference? Despite a tumultuous year for the president and the infamously relentless schedule at the Oval Office, president Obama is aging at the same rate as the rest of us, says expert S. Jay Olshansky (President is seen at a January 2008 campaign stop at left and in December 2014 at right) The LA Times writes that technology like that Olshansky used is available not just to professors but to anyone with an internet connection, at facemyage.com. 'It's a reflection on us. It is a direct reflection of the normal process of aging that we all experience and especially that we all experience right at that phase in our life,' the longevity expert said. 'Those of us that are in that our 50s and 60s — I'm sorry. We're all aging; he's just part of the crowd.' Despite evidence of a mounting racial divide in America during his tenure, continued conflicts abroad and an uphill battle for his party here at home, Obama's oft-noted graying temples are typical for anyone. In a 2011 study, Olshansky a study showed that many U.S. commanders in chief have actually lived longer than their peers. Using life expectancy data for men the same age as presidents on their inauguration days, the study found that 23 of 34 presidents who died of natural causes lived several years longer than expected. The four former presidents still alive have already lived longer than predicted, or likely will because they're in good health, the study said. Passage of time: George W. Bush's hair grayed markedly between 2001 (left) and 2008 (right) but at least one expert's study says that's just time passed . Stress can speed up those two outward signs of aging, and it's possible that job stress has made some presidents appear to age quickly. But the study shows that doesn't mean being doomed to an early grave. 'The graying of hair and wrinkling of the skin seen in presidents while they're in office are normal elements of human aging,'  Olshansky told the Associated Press at the time of the study. 'We don't actually know if they get more gray hair or more wrinkles' than other men their age. 'But even if they did, we don't die of gray hair and wrinkles,' Olshansky said. Given that most of the 43 men who have served as president have been college-educated, wealthy and had access to the best doctors, their long lives are actually not that surprising, he said. The 34 presidents who died of natural causes were aged 73 on average at death, a few months less than Olshansky's' life expectancy estimate. But under the accelerated aging theory, their average age of death would have been 68, he said. 'It's a reflection on us. It is a direct reflection of the normal process of aging that we all experience and especially that we all experience right at that phase in our life,' the longevity expert said. 'Those of us that are in that our 50s and 60s — I'm sorry. We're all aging; he's just part of the crowd.' (at left Bill Clinton is pictured in 1992, at right he's pictured again the year he left office two terms later in 2000) The 23 presidents who lived longer than Olshansky's projections died at an average age of 78, 11 years later than under the accelerated aging theory. The four presidents who were assassinated — Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy — were aged 52 on average at death. The first eight presidents were almost 80 years old on average when they died, at a time when the average life expectancy for men was less than age 35. 'It's absolutely extraordinary that they lived this long,' Olshansky said. That includes John Adams, who died at 90; James Madison, 85; and Thomas Jefferson, 83. Ditto the last eight presidents who died — seven lived longer than expected; Lyndon Johnson was the only one who didn't. He died of a heart attack at age 64, 10 years less than his projected life expectancy and five years less than his life expectancy with accelerated aging, Olshansky said. Among the more recent presidents, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford both died at 93. Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush are both 87. Olshansky has even done some projecting about 50-year-old President Barack Obama. Given his age when inaugurated, Obama's life expectancy would be 79, but Olshansky estimates that Obama will live to at least 82 because of his education, wealth and access to top-notch health care.",University of Illinois  aging expert S. Jay Olshansky says that despite his infamously relentless schedule Obama is aging at a normal rate .
"For any normal human 50 cents is worthless – for Tony Fernandes it was all he needed to buy his own airline. When Fernandes bought AirAsia in 2001 from Malaysian conglomerate DRB-Hicom for a single Malaysian ringgit – worth about 50 cents at the time – the carrier was in free fall and plunging deeper into debt by the day. But the flamboyant businessman built the small and failing company into a dominant player in south-east Asia with a low-cost model that focused on short and cheap flights. Some years later he started AirAsia X, which focused on long-haul flights. Scroll down for video . AIrAsia CEO Tony Fernandes used a low-cost model that focused on short and cheap flights to make the airline a major player in south-east Asia . Mr Fernandes worked with fellow air tycoon Sir Richard Branson at Virgin Communications London in the late 1980s. They are now firm friends . His cavalier attitude in business and willingness to take a punt on an outside chance made his name. One of his most notable recently was when he bought Premier League football team Queens Park Rangers in 2011. He is currently their chairman and the team is sponsored by AirAsia. A minute's silence was observed at the start of Rangers' Premier League game against Crystal Palace on Sunday for those missing. But the 50-year-old’s renowned self-belief will be severely tested after AirAsia flight QZ8501 between Surabaya, Indonesia and Singapore went missing with 137 adults, 17 children and one infant on board. It’s a nightmare now, but he’d dreamed of operating his own budget airline since he was in school, he told the BBC in 2010. His motto, according to the AirAsia website, is: ‘Believe the unbelievable. Dream the impossible. Never take no for an answer.’ Fernandes’ career in business would seem to reflect this. He had a net worth of $US650 million ($A703.27 million) as of February, according to Forbes, which listed him as the 28th richest person in Malaysia. The entrepreneur, who went to school at Epsom College in Surrey and later studied at the London School of Economics, made sure his first flight with the company – which had just two aircraft when he bought it – was one he was unable to take as a young boy. Mr Fernandes' motto with AirAsia is: ‘Believe the unbelievable. Dream the impossible. Never take no for an answer.’ ‘I always dreamt about doing a long-haul, low-cost airline,’ he said in a 2010 interview. ‘For my first ever flight in Air Asia X, I refused to do the launch to Australia and China and everyone thought it was a bit odd. But I wanted my first flight to be London-Kuala Lumpur. ‘It was very emotional for me 35 years on.’ The multi-millionaire's interests spread even further than the airline industry. As well as buying Queens Park Rangers in 2011, he also owned Formula One Team Caterham until this year. The Asian entrenprenuer bought Premier League football team Queens Park Rangers in 2011 . He previously worked with fellow air tycoon Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Communications London in the late 1980s, before joining Warner Music International in 1989. he adopted the Virgin airline owner's public, larger-than-life persona, and is now seen as the ‘Richard Branson of south-east Asia’. The two are now close friendsn 2013, Branson dressed up as an AirAsiaX female flight attendant after losing a bet to Fernandes over a Formula 1 race. Sir Richard Branson arrives at Kuala Lumpur dressed in an Air Asia flight attendant uniform and is handed a flight attendant graduation certificate by Mr Fernandes. The Virgin mogul had to do the stunt after losing a bet to Fernandes over a Formula One race . He was awarded a CBE in 2011, and is an Officer of the Legion d'Honneur in France, the highest honour a non-national can receive. Today though the devastated AirAsia CEO faces his biggest crisis and all he can do is hope. 'We are very devastated by what’s happened, it’s unbelievable,' he said in a media address in Surabaya on Monday. 'Our concern right now is for the relatives and for the next of kin – there is nothing more important to us, for our crew’s family, and for the passengers’ families. ‘We hope that the aircraft is found quickly, and we can find out the cause of what has happened.’ Mr Branson of Virgin GP and Mr Fernandes of Lotus stand beside their race cars before qualifying for the Abu Dhabi Formula One Grand Prix in 2010 .","Fernandes bought AirAsia in 2001 from Malaysian conglomerate DRB-Hicom for a single Malaysian ringgit – worth about 50 cents .

"A gang staged a Christmas Day robbery at a convent that the Pope uses as his summer retreat, assaulting the Mother Superior during their rampage. Three men made off with €5,000 (£4,000) after the raid at Castel Gandolfo, 15 miles from Rome. The gang broke through a window at 12.30am as the nuns of the Pius XII institute were at prayers as part of their Christmas vigil.

After confiscating her mobile phone, the robbers locked her in the room. As the gang fled through a hole cut in a fence, the other nuns called police, but the raiders escaped in an accomplice’s car. Police are now checking CCTV footage from outside the convent to try to identify the crooks, who were not wearing masks. Last night the nuns were said to be in a state of shock.

"The National Gallery of Australia will lift its 20-year ban on people taking selfies with art works from next year. It is the Canberra gallery's attempt to catch up with times where social media is a major form of communication among friends and family. Barely a month into his new role as director of the NGA, Gerard Vaughan tabled the topic at his first council meeting in November and had the restriction scrapped to the delight of the smartphone-welding public, The Australian reported. It comes as part of the Canberra gallery's (pictured) attempt to catch up with social media as a major form of communication . The ban will be lifted come January 2015, bringing the NGA in line with many other galleries who have ditched the archaic practice. Assistant director Simon Elliott told ABC News Online despite the latest exhibition, James Turrell: a retrospective, being exempt from the ban, there were plenty other art works that were allowed to be photographed - including a majority of its permanent installations. He said this move not only meant people could document their time at the NGA for themselves and take home a souvenir, but it could also boost the gallery's profile. 'In 1982 when we opened you had to leave your camera in the cloak room,' Mr Elliott said. The gallery's director Gerard Vaughan tabled the topic at his first council meeting in November. The 20-year ban was scrapped and will be officially lifted from January 2015 . 'These days we wouldn't dream of taking people's phones off them and we don't take their cameras. 'We hope that the younger audience who are a little bit more technologically sophisticated will take advantage of [social media]... and [share] their photos online.' Restrictions on taking photographs remain in certain circumstances because artists opt to protect their copyright on art works by requesting no pictures are taken of their creations. The NGA joins many other art galleries in Australia who have relaxed restrictions to allow more people to take away a selfie to remember their visit.","Gallery director Gerard Vaughan tabled the topic at his first council meeting in November .

"A mother handed her three-month-old baby to a stranger claiming she could not afford to feed the child along with her six other children. The baby girl was only wearing a onesie and a thin hat when she was handed to passerby Jennifer Argo at an apartment complex in Phoenix at 7pm on Saturday night. Phoenix police officer James Holmes told KFVS12, that the woman told Argo  she could not afford to feed or clothe her baby - and claimed that she had six other children.

"First they were invited to join the Queen at church on Christmas morning. Now the Middletons are believed to have been given a coveted invitation to join a royal shooting party. Sources told the Daily Mail that the Duchess of Cambridge’s parents Michael and Carole, plus her siblings, Pippa and James, all accompanied Prince William hunting pheasant on Saturday on the monarch’s private Sandringham Estate. Scroll down for video . Royal invitation: Keen to show off their new ten-bedroom mansion, Anmer Hall, William and Kate are hosting an extravagant festive celebration for Michael, Carole, James and Pippa . It is not known whether other senior royals were part of the gathering, although it is unlikely that the Queen or Prince Philip would have ventured out. Current guests at Sandringham include Prince Charles, Princess Anne and her son, Peter Phillips, as well as the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The one notable absentee, however, was Kate, who is expecting her second child in April. She stayed at the couple’s new country mansion Anmer Hall, just a few miles away, with Prince George, before apparently joining the group for afternoon tea up at the main house. In recent years the Middletons have enthusiastically embraced the hunting, shooting and fishing set. In November 2010, just weeks before their daughter’s engagement to Prince William was announced, Mr and Mrs Middleton were photographed shooting on the Queen’s Scottish estate, Balmoral. First they were invited to join the Queen at church on Christmas morning. Now the Middletons are believed to have been given a coveted invitation to join a royal shooting party . The couple, accompanied by William and Kate, were seen being instructed by a ghillie in how to stalk deer in the hills above Birkhall, Charles’s Highland mansion on the edges of the estate, where the family were staying. Commentators regarded their presence there as a deeply significant moment for the former air hostess and her airline despatcher husband, who have made a fortune from their business selling party goods. Now there is an appearance at Sandringham, the Queen’s beloved Norfolk home which was left to her by her late father, King George VI. The Queen takes up residence there every Christmas until after the anniversary of his death on February 6. Sources have told the Mail that William and his guests left Anmer Hall promptly on Saturday morning and deliberately chose to shoot in an area of land not overlooked by public footpaths. After an ‘exhausting’ morning, the entire party enjoyed a slap-up lunch at Wood Farm, a private residence on the 20,000-acre Norfolk estate, courtesy of the Queen. Current guests at Sandringham include Prince Charles, Princess Anne and her son, Peter Phillips, as well as the Earl and Countess of Wessex . Sources have told the Mail that William and his guests left Anmer Hall promptly on Saturday morning and deliberately chose to shoot in an area of land not overlooked by public footpaths . The shooters were driven there in a covered wagon accompanied by their guns and dogs – possibly including William and Kate’s pet cocker spaniel, Lupo, who has been given gun dog training. It is believed that the party – joined by the Duchess of Cambridge – were then treated to high tea at the main house, where the Queen is staying. The Middletons were also invited by the Queen to join her family at church on Christmas Day, although they chose to drive themselves and arrived shortly before the royal party at the main entrance. As revealed by the Daily Mail, William’s in-laws arrived in Norfolk more than a week ago for what has been described as a ‘perfect family Christmas’. Keen to show off their new ten-bedroom mansion, Anmer Hall, just a few miles from Sandringham House, William and Kate have been hosting an extravagant festive celebration for the entire Middleton clan. The house, which boasts its own swimming pool and tennis court, was a wedding gift from the Queen and has recently undergone a multi-million pound refit. ‘The Duchess has long been keen to host big family Christmas in her new home, the kind of Christmas she enjoyed as a girl,’ a source said. After briefly meeting with fellow royals at the main house after Church, William and Kate left to join the Middletons for lunch at Anmer – a distinct break with royal tradition.","Middletons  given a coveted invitation to join a royal shooting party .

"Pill-popper: German dictator Adolf Hitler allegedly was a manic depressive with Parkinson¿s, had deformed genitals, had no libido and devoured a cocktail of drugs . Adolf Hitler was a drug-abusing hypochondriac with deformed genitals who regularly consumed a cocktail of amphetamines, bull semen, rat poison and morphine when he sent millions of innocent people to their death. That's according to a new explosive TV documentary based on recently-discovered records and letters from the Nazi leader's obese personal physician, Dr Theodore Morell. In a desperate attempt to show his followers he was the epitome of male virility, the 5ft 8ins German leader downed more than 80 different drugs each day - a shocking habit that some psychiatrists and . historians believe turned an  egomaniac into a sadistic mass murderer. According to National Geographic's Nazi Underworld - Hitler's Drug Use Revealed, psychiatrist Professor Nassir Ghaemi claims Hitler's drug abuse exacerbated his manic depression, reducing him to a feeble, trembling figure. 'It’s not whether . Hitler was an amphetamine addict or not – it’s that Hitler had bipolar . disorder and amphetamines made it worse,' he said. 'That . is the issue. That has never been described before and that would . explain a lot why Hitler changed in the late 1930s and the 1940s.' According to the Irish Mirror, a series of letters and medical reports on Hitler commissioned by the U.S. military after the war were released in America, among them interviews with the Fuhrer's six doctors including Morell. The 47-page classified report stated Hitler had chronic eczema, persistent stomach cramps and appalling flatulence. No-one was able to cure the leader's afflictions - until Morell prescribed live bacteria which eased the cramps. A delighted Hitler made Morell his personal physician for nine years, even though his aides called the 'Reichsmaster of injections' a 'quack', 'phony' and 'charlatan'. The . reports show Hitler snorted powdered cocaine to 'clear his sinuses . and soothe his throat' and used eye-drops infused with 10 per cent cocaine. His dosage was lowered when he began to 'crave' the illicit drug. In his drug cabinet, the controversial doctor kept gun-cleaning oil which had been banned from human consumption and . flatulence pills made from rat poison. Morell's methods were so controversial, other doctors believed he was a 'double agent' trying to poison Hitler who was experiencing 'rapid double cycling'. 'Some of his American interrogators . wondered whether he was a double agent, trying to make Hitler so . dysfunctional that he couldn’t win, couldn’t achieve what he wanted,' Ghaemi said. Mis-medication? Hitler's physician Dr Theodore Morell ¿ dubbed the ¿Reichsmaster of injections¿ by Nazis - allegedly prescribed the Fuhrer a cocktail of drugs . Addict: Recently-discovered records and letters from his physician reveal Hitler was prescribed a cocktail of more than 80 different drugs . The report also state Morell injected Hitler with extracts from the . prostate glands or ground testicles of young bulls to boost his libido so he could keep up with his much-younger lover. 'Morell gave Hitler a . preparation called Testoviron, a kind of testosterone preparation, . usually before Hitler was going to spend a night with Eva Braun,' Cambridge . University historian Richard Evans said. 'Eva . Braun was young and much fitter. Hitler was much older, he was lazy, he . didn’t take much exercise and I’m sure he asked Dr Morell to help . him out before he went to bed with Braun.” Morell’s . notes also reveal the dictator feared cancer and was paranoid about catching the common cold. Morell . treated Hitler throughout the war even though other Nazi doctors . blamed him for the dictator’s dramatic deterioration and hyperactive gabbling. The Irish Mirror reports the doctor confessed to administering opiates, morphine, . barbiturates and amphetamines when he was captured by the Allies and accused of criminal . negligence. The revelations have led some historians to speculate whether Hitler's extreme and erratic war-mongering was influenced by his drug addiction. However others fear the claims feed Hitler excusers and . neo-Nazis. 'Just 48 . hours before his death Hitler dictated his will, as lucid and alert as . ever. His mental capabilities were normal,' Hans-Joachim . Neumann, author of Was Hitler Ill?, said. 'The Jews were not wiped out because Hitler was ill, but because . most Germans followed his decisions. Hitler always knew what he was . doing.'","Hitler was a manic depressive hypochrondriac with deformed genitals, according to a National Geographic documentary .

"Drought in the southwestern U.S. will deplete the vast Lake Mead this week to levels not seen since Hoover Dam was completed and the reservoir on the Colorado River was filled in the 1930s, federal water managers said Tuesday. The projected lake level of about 1,080 feet above sea level will be below the level of about 1,082 feet recorded in November 2010 and the 1,083-foot mark measured in April 1956 during another sustained drought. But U.S. Bureau of Reclamation regional chief Terry Fulp said water obligations will be met at least through next year without a key shortage declaration. The result will be full deliveries to cities, states, farms and Indian tribes in an area that's home to some 40 million people and the cities of Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles. Scroll down for video . Drought: Water levels at lake Mead in Nevada have reached an all-time low after a 14-year drought . Echo Bay: Lake Mead's Echo Bay Marina lies abandoned in mud above the water line . Abandoned: Shrubs grow around a boat near Boulder Beach in an area that used to be completely submerged under water . Low: Signs warn boaters of the low water levels at the Echo Bay launch ramp . 'We continue to closely monitor the projections of declining lake levels and are working with stakeholders throughout the Lower Basin to keep as much water in Lake Mead as we can through various storage and conservation efforts,' Fulp said in a statement. The lake on Tuesday was just under 1,082 feet above sea level, and the reservoir was about 39 percent full, said Rose Davis, a bureau spokeswoman in Boulder City, Nevada. The dropping level since the reservoir was last full in 1998, at just under 1,296 feet above sea level, has left as much as 130 feet of distinctive white mineral 'bathtub ring' on hard rock surfaces surrounding the lake. Davis said the bureau expects a slight increase in water level to about 1,083 feet by Jan. 1, 2015. Lake Mead National Recreation Area, 30 miles east of Las Vegas, is among the federal government's top tourist attractions. It drew some 6.3 million visitors in 2013, about the same number as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Bridge to nowhere: This bridge used to lead over water that has since dried up . Boat launch: This used to be the boat launch at the Las Vegas Bay Marina until a lengthy drought lowered lake levels . Marina: The Echo Bay Marina closed last year after no business wanted to operate it . Tires: Tires once used as a breakwater sit at the abandoned Echo Bay Marina . Boaters and swimmers have largely ignored the dropping water levels in a place where splashing in cold fresh water on 100-plus-degree summer days is a treat. But they've also dealt with marina closures in recent years. Visitors who used to feed scraps to carp from restaurant deck tables may now need to trek hundreds of yards with sandwiches and beach blankets to enjoy a waterside lunch. 'We projected this was coming,' Davis said. 'We are basically where we expected to be, given the dry winters in 2012 and 2013.' Lake Mead today stores about 10.2 million acre-feet of water and is managed in conjunction with Lake Powell, the reservoir farther up the Colorado River near the Utah-Arizona state line. Davis said Lake Powell was at 52 percent capacity, holding about 12.7 million acre-feet of water. Water officials say an acre-foot is about enough water to supply an average Nevada household for a year. Fulp compares controlled management of the two largest reservoirs on the Colorado River to pouring tea from one cup to another. Dried out: This 'No Boats' sign used to be completely submerged until a lengthy drought dried Lake Mead . Restrooms: This pair of restrooms sit on pontoons on the dried lake bed at Boulder Harbor . 'Bathtub ring': The white line on the rock shows where the water level used to be . Deserted: Empty boat slips protrude from the dock at the abandoned Echo Bay Marina . Warning: A buoy warning 'no boats; lies in cracked mud in a dried up Lake Mead . Seven southwestern U.S. states reap the result under a 1928 allocation agreement that also provides shares of Colorado River water to Native American tribes and Mexico. Las Vegas, with more than 2 million residents and about 40 million tourists a year, is almost completely dependent on Lake Mead for drinking water. Federal and state water officials have negotiated plans for a shortage declaration triggering delivery cuts to Nevada and Arizona if annual projections for the Lake Mead water level drop below a 1,075 foot elevation. That projection is based on data being compiled by the Bureau of Reclamation. Davis said the 1,075-foot trigger point is not expected this year or next. But last year, after back-to-back driest years in a century, federal water managers gave Arizona and Nevada a 50-50 chance of having water deliveries cut in 2016. California, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming wouldn't see direct cuts in their share of river water, but officials have acknowledged there would be ripple effects.","Drought will deplete the vast Lake Mead this week to .

"Sony has announced that its PlayStation Network is back online after a three-day hack-attack, but millions of users are still experiencing problems. On Monday morning, the service suffered connection problems for the fourth day in a row following the attack, allegedly by a hacker activist group known as Lizard Squad. PlayStation Network, which has 110million accounts worldwide was attacked by the group, which also targeted Microsoft Corp's Xbox Live, on Christmas Day. Under attack: Sony's PlayStation Network, which has 110million user accounts, was still suffering connection problems on Monday, four days after the initial hacker attack . 'We are currently experiencing widespread network issues that are being addressed,' Sony said in a statement on PlayStation's maintenance website. In a blog post Saturday night saying service had been restored, Sony vice president Catherine Jensen added that 'PlayStation Network and some other gaming services were attacked over the holidays with artificially high levels of traffic to disrupt connectivity and online gameplay.' Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which also went down Thursday, was back online Friday for its 40million subscribers, although the company reported continuing problems. Some gamers said on Twitter that they were able to access the PlayStation Network on Sunday, but others took to the microblogging site to complain about the continuing outage. It was not immediately clear how many of the 110 million PSN users who were still suffering problems Monday morning. Sony has admitted to still experiencing problems, taking to Twitter to say that services are 'gradually coming back online' after the Christmas Day hack-attack by Lizard Squad . On Sony's Twitter customer support account, AskPlayStation, a representative wrote, 'Network services are gradually coming back online.' Sony has been the victim of some of the most high-profile security breaches in history. In late November, Sony Pictures' computer system was taken down by hackers protesting the film, 'The Interview,' which depicts the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Hackers released several upcoming Sony movies as well as personal details of thousands of employees and the various aliases used by celebrities when they book into hotels to protect their anonymity. Dozens of highly embarrassing emails were made available to the public - including one which described Angelina Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'. Sony initially decided not to release The Interview but relented just before Christmas, and the film, co-written, co-produced and co-starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, made $15million in online rentals over the weekend, as well as $2.8million from theatres. Lizard Squad has claimed responsibility for attacks on the PlayStation Network in early December and August of this year. The August attack coincided with a bomb scare in which Lizard Squad tweeted to American Airlines that it heard explosives were on board a plane carrying an executive with Sony Online Entertainment. In 2011, hackers stole data belonging to 77 million PlayStation Network users.","PlayStation Network and XBox Live both hacked over Christmas .

"A sheet of plastic laid over a clothesline. A mini-fortress of milk crates stacked under a tree. A thin mattress on a flimsy crate lying in a dark tunnel. On the edge of Baltimore's woodlands, dozens of the city's transients live in makeshift homes which they consider safer than homeless shelters. Photographer Ben Marcin has captured some of the shanties in his thought-provoking photo essay, 'The Camps', documenting the struggle, loneliness and ingenuity of Maryland's people of the woods. The Camps: Snapper Ben Marcin has uncovered the illusive, hidden dwellings of Baltimore's homeless in his moving photographic series . Out of sight: Marcin searched for secluded territories, learning where camps were likely to spring up behind various railroad tracks, Wal-Marts and fast food areas . Rough sleepers: Marcin said some of the homeless people he spoke to preferred to sleep under a bridge than in a shelter which they considered unsafe . Desolate: Marcin's photo series reveals the loneliness of many rough sleepers who chose to carve out their own lives using whatever materials they could get their hands on . Similar to his Last House Standing series which captured lonely rowhouses around the Mid-Atlantic, Marcin shot the shanties around Baltimore without their inhabitants to add to the 'mystery'. Marcin said he first stumbled upon the . homeless dwellings as he hiked through the woods bordering the city . during hunting season. When he saw a 'mini-fortress' made of milk crates just yards from a major thoroughfare, Marcin began searching for other transients 'living off the grid'. Most were based near railroad tracks, Walmarts, gas stations, and liquor stores. Representative: The incredibly diverse style of shelters reflect the personal struggles and needs of their owners . Special touches: Despite living on the outskirts of town, shelter owners often tried to make their space homely with greeting mats and flower vases . Inspiration: Marcin was inspired to track down the city's hidden dwellings after stumbling upon this makeshift home made up of stacked milk crates hidden in the bushes just yards from a major thoroughfare near downtown Baltimore . While most of the camps Marcin came across used basic tarps or tents, several were quite elaborate such as this home built entirely of wooden doors . 'I . have always been interested in the unique places people live in, . particularly where there exists an element of defiance or desperation, . or both. In these situations, a house can often reflect the dilemma of . its owner. In the case of the hobo camps, this reflection is quite . pronounced for obvious reasons,' he told The Atlantic Cities. 'A . sheet of plastic laid out over a clothesline may be the last stand for . somebody who has either been rejected by society or who has refused to . conform to whatever rules are being imposed on them. 'Several . camp people I talked to said they wouldn't relocate into one of the . City's shelters because they were afraid of being assaulted or having . belongings stolen.' The road most traveled: Most of the settlements Marcin photographed were by waterways, railway tracks, Walmarts, gas stations and liquor stores . Mystery: Marcin deliberately didn't photograph camp residents, instead focusing on how they lived, the mark they made and what they left behind . Slums: Marcin came across a number of makeshift settlements or groups of people living off the grid around Baltimore . Marcin said about year after finishing . the project, he returned to the woods to find all the camps were gone. One had burned to the ground, some had been bulldozed, while others . moved to different locations. 'My guess is that these, too, will not be around for long,' he said. Other Ben Marcin photographic collections can be viewed at his website benmarcinphotos.com or at C. Grimaldis Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland. Living off the grid: While some homes comprised a sheet over a branch, this settlement had a clothes line, barbecue and gym equipment . Out of the way: Marcin captured each makeshift abode in full panorama view, showing their isolation and alienation . Traveling light: The dwellings Marcin snapped have since been abandoned,  demolished or burned to the ground . Homely: During his photographic odyssey, Marcin became increasingly fascinated at the effort that went into remaining hidden in plain sight and the creativity involved . Hidden away: Marcin said he found himself 'practically stepping into a number of homeless camps that were carefully hidden among strips of trees or bushes' near highways and shopping centers . No options: While several residents told Marcin that living in a tent or sleeping on a mattress in the woods was a personal choice, it seemed to him that there was often no other choice .","Photographer Ben Marcin's series 'The Camps' captures makeshift settlements near railway lines, gas stations, Walmarts and bridges .

"Defiant: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is headed for a clash with the EU and the IMF . The European Union has stepped up pressure on Hungary over the country's refusal to implement austerity policies and threatened legal action over its new constitution. The warnings escalated the standoff between Budapest and the EU, as Hungary negotiates fresh financial aid from Europe and the International Monetary Fund. Over the past months, the country's credit rating has been cut to junk by all three major rating agencies, unemployment is 10.6 percent and the country may be facing a recession. But bailout negotiations broke down after Budapest refused to cut public spending and implemented a new constitution reasserting political control over its central bank. The EU fears the new constitution hurts the independence of the country's judges, its central bank and its data protection agency. Some civil rights groups and the European Parliament have warned that the former Soviet-bloc nation of 10million, which led the fight against communism with its 1956 revolution, risks losing its democratic footing. EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn today also blasted Hungary's fiscal policies - which rely on unorthodox one-time measures instead of fiscal austerity. Hungary ran a surplus in 2011 and its deficit is expected to remain below the 3 percent of economic output allowed under EU rules. But Mr Rehn said that had Budapest not nationalised private pension funds to buffer state coffers, its deficit would have been 6 per cent of Gross Domestic Product last year. He warned the EU could withhold valuable development funds if the Hungarian government continues to resist taking new cost-cutting measures. Criticism: EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn today blasted Hungary's fiscal policies and called for the country to implement austerity measures . A spokesman for the European . Commission, Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen, said the Commission, which is . analysing whether Hungary's new laws violate the EU treaty, remained . concerned and would not shy away from using all its powers to fight any . violations. 'A legally stable environment, based on the rule of law, including respect for media freedom, democratic principles and fundamental rights, is also the best guarantee for citizens' trust and confidence of partners and investors,' she said. 'This is particularly vital in times of economic crisis.' In a statement, the Hungarian government said it was 'committed to universal European values' and was 'ready for negotiations and to find solutions' with the Commission about any of its concerns. The new constitution came into force just weeks after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government requested financial aid from the EU and the IMF. The two institutions broke off preliminary talks on the rescue package in December, after voicing fears that the new laws compromised the independence of Hungary's central bank. EU treaties demand that central banks remain independent. Discussions between Hungary and the IMF resumed Wednesday in Washington. The Hungarian Parliament, by the Danube, Budapest: Hungary's lawmakers have angered the EU by reasserting political control over the country's central bank . Hungary's deficit has been criticised by the EU since the central European nation joined the 27-member bloc in 2004. But its economy has been staggering since 2008, when the global credit crunch forced Hungary to accept an IMF bailout of €20billion (£16.5billion). The European Commission said Hungary has taken 'no effective action' to limit its deficit, making the country's finances unsustainable in the long run. The Hungarian currency, the forint, hit a record above 324 per euro last week. On Wednesday, the forint was trading at 312 to the euro, while the interest rate for Hungary's 10-year forint bond was near 9.5 per cent, an unsustainable burden. Three EU nations - Greece, Portugal and Ireland - had to seek international bailouts after their interest rates rose above 7 per cent.","Constitution asserts political control over central bank .

"Futuristic: Tom Cruise as Chief John Anderton in Minority Report . When police in Minority Report predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before they did it, it was considered so futuristic, the film was set in 2054. Now, however, law enforcers in two American states are using crime-prediction software to predict which freed prisoners are most likely to commit murder, and supervising them accordingly. Instead of relying on parole officers to decide how much supervision inmates will need on the outside by looking at their records, the new system uses a computer algorithm to decide for them. The Minority Report-style software is already being used in Baltimore and Philadelphia to predict future murderers, and will be extended to Washington D.C. soon. It has been developed by Professor Richard Berk, a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who believes it will reduce the murder rate and those of other crimes. Prof. Berk says his algorithm could be used to help set bail amounts and also decide sentences in the future.  It could also be modified to predict lesser crimes. He told ABC News that currently parole officers are using their own judgment to decide what level of supervision each parolee should have, based on their criminal record. His software, he said, replaces that 'ad-hoc' decision making, and should identify eight future murderers out of 100. He said: 'People assume that if someone murdered then they will murder in the future, but what really matters is what that person did as a young individual. 'If they committed armed robbery at age 14, that's a good predictor. 'If they committed the same crime at age 30, that doesn't predict very much.' Prof. Berk's researchers used the details of more than 60,000 crimes then wrote an algorithm to find the people behind the crimes who were more likely to commit murder when they were out of prison. Pre-cog: Samantha Morton plays a human who can see into the future in Minority Report . The software predicts future criminals like the 'PreCogs' in the Tom Cruise film who can see crimes not yet committed . Future murderer? Neal McDonough, centre, and Colin Farrell, right, co-starred with Cruise in Minority Report . Criteria including criminal record, type of crime, location, and age at which the individual committed the crime were analysed, with type of crime and age proving to be the most reliable predictors of future crime. He said even his students at the University of Pennsylvania compared his work to Minority Report, the 2002 film starring Tom Cruise in which gifted humans called 'PreCogs' can see into the future and predict who will commit crimes. In the film, Cruise plays the elite crime squad head Chief John Anderton, who himself is accused of committing a murder in the future. Prof. Berk's work has been described as 'very impressive' by Shawn Bushway, a professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York at Albany. However he cautioned that human rights campaigners might see that the extra supervision mandated by the software for those deemed most likely to murder might amount to harassment.

The victim who has come forward is . understood to have told a social worker how she was ‘handed around among . the men’ for five years. Three months ago the girl, now 16, . felt confident enough to give police an official statement revealing the . extent of the abuse she suffered.

"Revealing: A list of keywords used by government analysts to scour the internet for evidence of threats to the U.S. was released under the Freedom of Information Act . The Department of Homeland Security has been forced to release a list of keywords and phrases it uses to monitor social networking sites and online media for signs of terrorist or other threats against the U.S. The intriguing the list includes obvious choices such as 'attack', 'Al Qaeda', 'terrorism' and 'dirty bomb' alongside dozens of seemingly innocent words like 'pork', 'cloud', 'team' and 'Mexico'. Released under a freedom of information request, the information sheds new light on how government analysts are instructed to patrol the internet searching for domestic and external threats. The words are included in the department's 2011 'Analyst's Desktop Binder' used by workers at their National Operations Center which instructs workers to identify 'media reports that reflect adversely on DHS and response activities'. Department chiefs were forced to release the manual following a House hearing over documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit which revealed how analysts monitor social networks and media organisations for comments that 'reflect adversely' on the government. However they insisted the practice was aimed not at policing the internet for disparaging remarks about the government and signs of general dissent, but to provide awareness of any potential threats. As well as terrorism, analysts are instructed to search for evidence of unfolding natural disasters, public health threats and serious crimes such as mall/school shootings, major drug busts, illegal immigrant busts. The list has been posted online by the Electronic Privacy Information Center - a privacy watchdog group who filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act before suing to obtain the release of the documents. In a letter to the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counter-terrorism and Intelligence, the centre described the choice of words as 'broad, vague and ambiguous'. Scroll down for full list .

"A Malaysian boy aged six has been accused of raping his five-year-old cousin in a case believed to be the one of the first of its kind in the world. Doctors discovered she had been sexually penetrated after a medical check-up - and despite initial scepticism a consultant urologist at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital said it was possible for a child that young to have an erection. The extraordinary case came to light after the children's grandmother found them naked and playing 'mothers and fathers' at the family home in the town of Pendang, Kedah - a rural area covered with paddy fields . Medical check-up: Doctors at Kuala Lumpur discovered the five-year-old girl had been sexually penetrated by the boy in a case which has shocked Malaysia . Trauma: The case in Malaysia is believed to be one of the first of its kind in the world. File picture . The girl's 32 year old mother, a medical assistant, then lodged a report on New Year's Day, Malaysia's Star newspaper reported. But the paper said that the following day the mother told police she was not keen to pursue the case and had only reported it so her daughter could be checked at a hospital. The doctor who examined the girl and . found a minor tear in the hymen alerted the Malacca Action Group for . Parents in Education. Chairman Mak Chee Hin said: 'It is shocking that young children are capable of such acts. Rural: The town where the boy is alleged to have raped the girl is surrounded by paddy fields . 'Blame should be levelled at the adults who do not give guidance and care to the children.'

He added: 'In Western countries, medical reports suggest that young boys and girls can experience orgasm although boys will not be able to ejaculate until puberty. 'For Asian children, it is very rare, although there have been rare cases that are mostly attributed to surroundings and upbringing.' This case, he added, could have happened due to exposure to pornographic materials. 'It could be due to witnessing an adult performing an intimate act or watching pornographic videos, said the urologist. “Even if the child had an erection, it would have only lasted for a while and not to the extent of penetration.","Case in Malaysia believed to be the one of first of its kind in the world .

"One in ten children under the age of four is now Muslim in England and Wales, the latest statistics show. In the under-fives age group there are nearly twice as many people identified as Muslim as in the general population, census data reveals. The figures suggest a change in the UK’s younger generation of worshippers as less than 0.5 per cent of over 85s in Britain identify as Muslim. Diverse: One in ten children under the age of four is now Muslim in England and Wales, the latest statistics show . One expert said the number of practising Muslims could soon outnumber the number of Christians who actively worship in the UK. David Voas, Professor of Population Studies at the University of Essex, told The Times: ‘It’s not inconceivable.’ An Office for National Statistics breakdown of Britain’s religions and age groups shows in 2011 there were 3.5 million children aged 0-4, of whom 320,000 were Muslim. That proportion is more than 9 per cent and compares with a total Muslim population among all age groups of less than 5 per cent. There were 1.6 million Muslims in England and Wales in 2001, or 3 per cent of the population, according to the census. By 2011 the Muslim population had grown to 2.7 million people or 4.8 per cent of the population. Increase: By 2011 the Muslim population had grown to 2.7 million people or 4.8 per cent of the population . ‘It certainly is a startling figure,’ said David Coleman, Professor of Demography at the University of Oxford. ‘We have had substantial immigration of Muslims for a long time. ‘Continuing immigration from Pakistan, Bangladesh and India has been added to by new immigration from African countries and from the Middle East. Birth rates of Muslims of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin remain quite high, although falling. There seem to be very low levels of falling away from religion among Muslims.’ The largest religious group, at 1.5 million, among those aged 0-4 is still comprised of Christians, 43 per cent. Dale Barton, priest in charge at St . Clement’s, a Church of England parish in Bradford, said: ‘This was a . white working-class British area 50 years ago. They have all gone. There . are two pubs hanging on by their fingertips. There’s a Labour club. One . club has just gone. Shops are now Muslim-owned. I’m not decrying that. A . significant number open on Christmas Day.’ Worsjip: The largest religious group, at 1.5 million, among those aged 0-4 is still comprised of Christians, 43 per cent . There are now 136 Muslim schools, 125 of them in the private sector, according to the Department for Education. Britain has a total of 1,600 mosques and the first UK halal food festival was held in September. Ibrahim Mogra, assistant secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said that the large number of young Muslim children reflected the confidence that Muslims had in the country, encouraging them to bring up families here. ‘I just wouldn’t want our fellow citizens to be alarmed by an increase in number,’ he said. ‘This generation is very much British. They feel very much this is their home. It’s not about Britain becoming a Muslim country but about Britain enabling the practice of Islam, which gives confidence to the vast majority of Muslims. It’s a great country to regard as our home.’","Census data shows nearly twice as many under-fives identified as Muslim as in general population .

"The Bible says the the Sea of Gallilee is where Jesus Christ walked on water -- though the holy site will likely be the place respect for Congress sinks even lower after it was revealed that a freshman House member stripped naked and jumped into the water there during an official tour of Israel. Kansas Rep Kevin Yoder, 36, who was voted one of 'Hottest Freshmen in Congress,' has apologised after getting into trouble for skinny dipping in the holy water in August 2011. He was one of six Congressmen who jumped in the lake after a drunken night out at a high-price hotel, it emerged on Sunday. Embarrassed: Rep Kevin Yoder, who is from a suburb of Kansas City, Kansas, apologized for skinny dipping during the trip to the Holy Land . Politico reports . that the hard-partying in the Holy Land was so outrageous that it led . the FBI to open an investigation and prompted embarrassed Republican . party leaders to dress down the freshman lawmakers . Rep Yoder admitted disrobing in front of one Congressman's daughter and the wife of another member. He and thirty freshman lawmakers had gone to Israel in August 2011 for an all-expense-paid trip, along with their families and aides, that cost a reported $10,000 per person. The American Israel Educational Foundation paid for the trip, which is a rite of passage for new members of Congress. The group, closely tied to the powerful AIPAC, says it uses the visits to Israel to educate each new class of lawmakers about the importance of the the Jewish nation's relationship with the United States. Republican leaders Reps Eric Candor . and Kevin McCarthy -- the no. 2 and no. 3 ranking members of the House . -- who escorted the first-year Congressmen, were reportedly furious and told the members that they were trivializing the mission of the junket to the Holy Land. Rep Yoder admitted to the incident and said he was sorry in a statement to Politico, saying: 'It is my greatest honor to represent the people of Kansas in Congress and (for) any embarrassment I have caused for my colleagues and constituents, I apologize.' Adding to the Kansas City Star he said: 'I feel incredibly remorseful that I have caused embarrassment to my constituents and I have caused folks who believe in me to be disappointed. 'The gravity of the situation and the actions I've taken are not lost on me, and I feel certainly regret at what has occurred, and I just want to apologize to my constituents for a momentary lapse in judgment.' Sacred: The Sea of Galilee is where the Bible says Jesus Christ walked on water. It remains holy to Christians . But while he said sorry for the naked swim, Rep Yoder denied claims he was intoxicated, as he did in 2009 when he was cited for refusing . to take a DUI breathalyzer test after being pulled over by a Kansas . Highway Patrol trooper. He said he had had wine with dinner but was not drunk. According to Politico, the Congressional delegation was staying at the Scots Hotel in Tiberias along the Sea of Gallilee. After dinner at the $1,000-a-night resort, several members and Congressional staffers stuck around and continued drinking. At some point in the night, the group decided to take a swim in the nearby lake. Some of the participants waded in in their clothes -- others partially disrobed. Only Rep Yoder took all his clothes off, Politico says. The other participants in the after-dark swim were: Rep Steve Southerland, of Florida, and his daughter; Rep Tom Reed, of New York, and his wife; Reps Ben Quayle, of Arizona, Jeff Denham, of California, and Michael Grimm, of New York. Several aides also jumped in, Politico reports: Steve Stombres, Rep Cantor’s chief of staff; Tim Berry, Rep McCarthy’s chief of staff; Laena Fallon, Rep Cantor’s former communications director and Emily Murray, Rep McCarthy’s top health care aide. During the trip, the Congressman met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli President Shimon Peres and the ambassadors between the two nations.","Rep Kevin Yoder apologises for skinny dipping in the Sea of Gallilee .

"A four-year-old girl was brought back to life on the side of the road by a passerby after being submerged in an upturned car in a ditch of water for ten minutes. The accident happened  near Brandon in Mississippi on Sunday afternoon. Helena White's mother crashed into the water after turning around to look at a drawing her daughter had done, according to Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey. 'By the time she turned back around to the front, she had lost control of the vehicle, overcorrected and flipped,' Bailey said, reports The Clarion Ledger. Scroll down for video . A four-year-old girl was brought back to life on the side of the road by a passerby after being submerged in car (pictured) in a creek for ten minutes . Helena White is currently in a critical condition in hospital - she was given CPR by a passerby . Sherry Jackson told The Clarion Ledger the car was submerged in a ditch which had about 15-foot of water. She said after hearing the mother's screams, she jumped into the water and found unconscious Helena in the back seat of the car - but she was trapped. She said that her and a group of five other people could not pull her out and they had difficulty cutting her free from the car seat. Finally the group managed to roll the car high enough out the water to move the objects in their way and cut Helena out of the seat. A video filmed on a police dash cam shows the crowd reviving the little girl after the accident . 'The little girl was blue,' Jackson said. 'We weren't sure if she was going to make it.' They took her up the bank and placed her by the side of the road - Jackson did mouth-to-mouth. A police dash cam shows them drawing up to the crowd where the little girl was and a deputy running out and taking over chest compressions. Helena and her mother were transported to University of Mississippi Medical Center - the child is in a critical condition. Helena's mother crashed after she turned around to look at a drawing the little girl had done, according to police . Jackson told The Clarion Ledger that she instinctively jumped in to the water. 'You don't think, you just do,' Jackson said. 'God definitely put all of the right people there at the right time. 'If it was my child, I know someone would have done the same thing for me.'

"Two fishermen were left stranded after a strong tidal current pulled their vehicle, boat and trailer  into the crocodile infested creek. The men were trying to recover their boat at the ramp  after returning from an evening fishing trip at Buffalo Creek Boat Ramp in Darwin's northern suburbs on Sunday. One reversed the boat trailer down the ramp while the other waited in the boat.

Two recreational fishermen were left stranded after their vehicle, boat and trailer submerged into the creek . With the ongoing current, the vehicle and trailer were taken downstream and swept through the inhabit area of salt water crocodiles. Casuarina Police, who were patrolling the area at the time, were flagged down by the hapless men shortly before 2am. When police arrived, the vehicle had travelled about 50 metres away from the boat ramp with just the roof of the ute visible above the surface while the trailer had submerged.

The airport has descended into chaos after the Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747747 bound for Las Vegas and with more than 450 people on board was forced to return to London after developing a technical fault shortly after take-off. It is believed almost 10,000 passengers travelling to and from Gatwick have had their flights disrupted. Scroll down for video . Thousands of passengers flying to and from Gatwick have had their flights delayed, cancelled or diverted after a dramatic emergency landing closed the airport's single runway . Passengers from the stricken Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 arrive at the Hilton Hotel, London Gatwick Airport where they are staying for the night ready to fly to Las Vegas tomorrow morning . Virgin said it would be operating a special flight tomorrow for everyone who would like to continue their journey . Gatwick is the world's busiest single-runway airport. It sees up to 900 departures and arrivals per day . For several hours the jumbo jet circled the airport, dropping fuel before passengers were told to adopt the brace position for an emergency landing. The plane finally landed with only three quarters of its landing gear down after a set of wheels on the starboard wing refused to drop with holidaymakers praising the hero pilot for a 'text-book landing'. But the runway was closed for three hours while emergency crews helped those on board off and engineers examined the craft. It was finally reopened again at 7.03pm. A Gatwick airport spokesman said: 'The airport is now facilitating inbound and outbound flights but it will take some time for normal service to resume. 'We advise passengers to check with their airlines on the status of their flight. Updates will also be posted on the Gatwick website and on Twitter. 'We are working with our airline partners to provide food, drink and welfare facilities for those passengers whose flights may either have been delayed or cancelled. Gatwick staff and volunteers are being made available throughout the airport to offer passengers advice and the latest information.'

British Airways has so far cancelled 12 flights to and from Gatwick, arrivals were diverted to Bournemouth, Southampton while incoming flights from other European flights are being held on runways waiting for the Gatwick backlog to be cleared. Emergency services had been on standby as the giant aircraft, with 447 passengers and 15 crew aboard, came into land. Describing the mood on the plane, Dan Crane, 24, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said it was 'anxious, a lot were worried, some crying. The mood was quiet and (we were) just waiting for the captain's next announcement.' Mr Crane, who was with family and friends, said the crew kept everyone informed, adding: 'They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.' Mike Kaufman, speaking from his seat on the plane back at Gatwick, said: 'This was one of the greatest emergency landings in history. It was very smooth.' He praised the pilots and the cabin crew, saying the landing had been 'textbook'.

Interviewed for Sky News, he went on: 'We didn't realise there would be such a fuss. It was such a calm experience. About half an hour out they said we would have to go back to Gatwick. They said it was a hydraulic problem. 'The fact everything went so well shows just how professional the flight crew were. The crew were calm. We had a safety briefing two hours before we landed and when we were told we would have to go into the brace position for landings a sigh went around the plane.' Mr Kaufman told Sky News: 'Everybody gave the crew a big round of applause when we landed. I can't wait to get into the terminal and have a gin and tonic now. 'We were talking about going on a rollercoaster ride when we got to Las Vegas. Now I'm not so sure.'

"A 22-year-old has complained to police after CCTV footage appears to show him being thrown onto the ground for filming officers making an arrest outside a Christmas Party. Daniel Clements from Virginia was visiting a friend in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when he went outside the Varsity Theater during the event on Monday. There he claims that he was subjected to police brutality and has filed an official complaint with the force. A number of officers were in attendance assisting paramedics treating a girl who had passed out. Scroll down for video . Daniel Clements (pictured top left in the red shirt) was visiting a friend in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when he went outside the Varsity Theater during the event on Monday. He got his cell phone to film police officers making an arrest . One of the cops then notices and walks over to Clements, apparently grabs him and takes the cell phone out of his hand . Some of the cops then start to arrest another man, prompting Clements to take  his cell phone out. However one of the officers notices, grabs him while he has his arm around a girl, and appears to slam him into the sidewalk after taking the phone. Clement was booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison on charges of public intoxication, battery on police, resisting an officer and remaining after forbidden . Clements, who admitted he had been drinking at the time, then claims that the members of the BRPD then laid their knees into him before handcuffing him. He was then arrested, but has now filed an official complaint claiming there was an excessive use of force. 'I saw a police officer push somebody and I've always been told if something like that is going on, it's important to have an objective source of data for what happened,' Clement told WAFB. 'It (his cell phone) got ripped from my hands and as I turned to see who ripped it, another officer slammed me into the railing outside. A friend who was with Clements is then seen grabbing the arm of the officer who arrested him. He was subsequently tackled to the ground then allegedly sprayed with mace. In the official report obtained by the station, officers said they arrived  to disperse the crowd. They claimed Clements refused to leave. It also accuses the former student of jumping onto the backs of officers, which Clements denies.

"A young Paralympic hopeful has been able to wrap presents and pull Christmas crackers for the first time – thanks to a new bionic hand. Lyndon Longhorne, 19, lost both his legs, his right arm and the fingers on his left hand after suffering meningitis as a baby. Previously, the teenager said pulling crackers, cutting up turkey and playing board games were a struggle, but this year his Christmas has been transformed by having the gadget fitted. Last September Dragon's Den star Duncan Ballantyne accompanied Mr Longhorne to have new prosthetic  legs and a new knee joint  fitted. Lyndon Longhorne, 19, has been fitted with a bionic hand which has allowed him to pull crackers, cut up turkey and play board games for the first time. The hand can sense signals from the muscles in his arm . Mr Longhorne lost both his legs, his right arm and the fingers on his left hand after suffering meningitis as a baby. He was fitted with prosthetic legs (pictured) and a new knee joint on his right leg last September. This has allowed him to walk unaided and pass his driving test . This meant he was able to manoeuvre his knee without having to physically use his hand to turn it right or left. Since then, Mr Longhorne has learned to walk unaided, passed his driving test. He is also an avid swimmer, and is currently training six days a week, hoping to swim for England in the 2016 Paralympics in Rio. Mr Longhorne, of Crook, County Durham, says the bionic hand has changed his life. He said: 'I am able to open and close my hand with ease and even to different degrees using the bionic hand. 'It means I can grasp objects using the muscles in my arms and it has made a huge difference to my life.' The hand has two sensors inside which are able to read the signals sent from the muscles in his arm; one muscle tells the hand to close and the other to open. Made by prosthetics company RSLSteeper and called the 'Bebionic' hand, it is attached to his stump by suction. Mr Longhorne added: 'I am still learning to use it, it is controlled by electro-magnetic sensors which are attached to the muscles in my arm. 'I can now easily lift things and walk around holding them, which is a huge novelty for me. 'I wear it the majority of the time and I've found that I'm actually alright at wrapping presents. Mr Longhorne had a Bebionic bionic hand fitted, attached to his stump using suction. It's socket is fitted with two electrodes which are able to read the signals sent from his muscles. It's manufacturers say it has 14 different grip patterns, allowing amputees to carry out a wide range of basic tasks. It automatically senses when a gripped item is slipping and adjusts the grip to secure it, i's manufacturers claim. 'The hand has really helped me a lot over Christmas.' Mr Longhorne, who is studying business management and sport at the University of Salford, explained that he had to try three hands before making his final decision. He said: 'I wore each of the hands for about six weeks and kept a diary of each of them and then the consultant and I made a decision together to go for this one, it's easy to operate and it's very light. 'I'm still getting used to it I haven't even had it a month yet, but I can do things now that I couldn't before, like getting books off higher shelves in the library and carrying those around. 'Cutting food is easier as well. It's basic things, but they make a difference.' The hand follows on from a knee joint called the VGK ('Very Good Knee'), which meant he no longer had to manually turn his knee with his hand. He is currently trialling another knee called the C-Leg, which he was fitted with several weeks ago. As a result he has even greater flexibility of movement, and says he finds it easier to climb the stairs. As he lost his right leg above the knee, and his left below,  he only needs one bionic joint on his right. Mr Longhorne  added he has had a 'good year', after passing his driving test in May and moving away to university. He said: 'It was scary learning to drive at first. The hand's manufacturers claim it has 14 grip patterns giving amputees a wide range of movements. 'I can do things now that I couldn't before, like getting books off higher shelves in the library and carrying those around. Cutting food is easier as well,' Mr Longhorne said . The instructor said there was no reason I couldn't learn to drive using my legs, so I had about ten lessons and went in for my test and passed with one minor. 'It's given me so much freedom, I don't have to rely on anyone to take me places I can just get in the car and go wherever I want. 'I've had a lot of support from Duncan Bannatyne and I'm really grateful for that. He came to all of my appointments with me to get my legs and he's been great. 'I wouldn't be driving now without him.' He now in training six days a week for the 2016 Paralympics in Rio, which includes swimming and gym sessions. 'I just want to continue with university, get a good degree and see where life takes me,' he said. 'If I go to Rio then that's a bonus.'","Lyndon Longhorne, now 19, suffered deadly infection meningitis as a baby .

"Jeremy Clarkson has once again become embroiled in controversy after appearing to poke fun at the 'slope' racism row on the Top Gear Christmas special. The 54-year-old appeared to mock the decision by Ofcom earlier this year which ruled he had been 'deliberately offensive' after using the word 'slope' on an episode of the BBC show. In Saturday's Christmas special, Clarkson told co-presenter Richard Hammond: 'That is a proud moment, Hammond, but... is it straight?' as they admired their makeshift bridge in Argentina. Many took it to as a reference to his comments in a March episode of the show in which he said: 'That is a proud moment, but there's a slope on it', as a man walked towards them on their makeshift bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand. In the Top Gear Christmas special, Jeremy Clarkson appeared to mock the decision by Ofcom over the 'slope' row by asking Richard Hammond: 'That is a proud moment, Hammond, but... is it straight?' about a bridge . Clarkson appeared to be poking fun at the decision by Ofcom, which ruled he had been 'deliberately offensive' after using the word 'slope' on an episode of the show (above) as an Asian man crossed a bridge . At the time, viewers complained about the use of the word 'slope', which is considered a derogatory term for people of Asian descent. Clarkson (pictured) has been embroiled in several controversies in recent years . At the time, viewers complained about the use of the word 'slope', which is considered a derogatory term for people of Asian descent. Ofcom launched an investigation into the Burma TV special and ruled in July that the presenter had 'deliberately employed the offensive word to refer to the Asian person'. The regulator decided there was 'insufficient context to justify the broadcast of this material' and that the BBC did not apply generally accepted standards to protect viewers from offensive material. The programme's executive producer, Andy Wilman, previously apologised for the use of the term, saying it had been intended as a 'light-hearted word-play joke' and that the team had been unaware the term was considered offensive. As the latest controversy involving Clarkson and Top Gear came to light, the television presenter took to his Twitter page to express his love for the country Chile. In a tweet this morning, he wrote: 'Can I just say this morning what a lovely country Chile is. Great food, wonderful people, tremendous hotels and beautiful scenery.' He later added: 'I've been reminded about Chilean wine which is, by far, the best in the world.' Before concluding: 'In all seriousness, I would like to thank the people and government of Chile for their help and support when everything went wrong.' The presenter was referring to the help the Top Gear team received from the country's security in allowing them into the country as they fled Argentina. The second-part Christmas special of Top Gear, which aired last night, showed the crew's hasty departure from Argentina. Clarkson, Hammond and co-presenter James May were forced to flee the country after angry mobs started targeting them when Clarkson displayed a numberplate of H982 FKL – an apparent reference to the 1982 Falklands War. The Top Gear team, featuring Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May, were in Argentina as part of their mission to reach the bottom of South America in V8 sports cars and build a 'stadium' from containers . The Top Gear team were forced to flee Argentina after angry mobs started targeting them when Clarkson displayed a numberplate of H982 FKL on his sports car – an apparent reference to the 1982 Falklands War . In a series of tweets this morning, Clarkson expressed his love for Chile and thanked the country for support . The Top Gear team were in Argentina as part of their mission to reach the bottom of South America in V8 sports cars, build a 'stadium' from shipping containers and play a game of 'car football'. In the wake of the Top Gear's visit to South America, leading Argentine daily newspaper, Clarin, has accused Clarkson of continuing to strain the relationship between Britain and Argentina. It dubbed the BBC's Top Gear special 'the programme of controversy.' And another newspaper, La Nacion - referring to the diplomatic row the programme generated and referring to the Falklands by their Spanish name - blasted: 'The BBC broadcast the Top Gear programme that poked fun at Argentinians over the Malvinas.' Argentine news channel TN also headlined its coverage by saying: 'They broadcast the controversial programme.' It added: 'Despite the Argentine government's protests, the BBC broadcast the second part of the Top Gear programme filmed in Patagonia. They showed the team fleeing after the provocation over the Malvinas.' Clarkson displayed a numberplate of H982 FKL on his sports car while driving through Argentina – with many people claiming it was a reference to the 1982 Falklands War. Clarkson said it was simply a coincidence . Clarkson became embroiled in controversy earlier this year when he apparently used the term n******. He made an apology video  to explain he had been trying not to use the term in the 'eeny meeny' nursery rhyme . Last night's Top Gear Christmas special also created debate on social media. One Argentine wrote on Facebook: 'I've just watched the programme. 'Apart from the offensive numberplate and the stupidity of the presenters, I've seen some excellent images, perhaps some of the finest I've ever seen of the area. 'The quality of the filming is exceptional and the choice of routes and places along the way impeccable. You see the programme and want to go there.' But the post drew an immediate response from another who claimed: 'I go to Patagonia twice a year to fish and I have thousands of photos. 'I don't need these Top Gear clowns to enjoy the naturalness of what thank God is Argentinian and not pirate-owned. March 16: Top Gear Burma special featuring 'slope' remark airs in the UK. March 29: Indian-born actress Somi Guha reveals she is suing the BBC for up to £1million over 'slope' remark. Clarkson responds: 'I'm not racist, I am currently sitting in a bar with a man who lives quite near Wales'. April 21: Named his black-haired terrier Didier Dogba after the Ivory Coast footballer. April 23: Top gear executive producer Andy Wilman says he 'regrets' use of the word 'slope' being broadcast bit insisted it was 'light-hearted wordplay'. May 1: Clarkson denied allegations that he was caught on camera using the n-word during filming of the hit BBC series. In unaired footage the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'. May 2: Clarkson releases a statement saying it was 'inevitable' the BBC would eventually sack him but ‘begged’ for public forgiveness after the footage was aired. May 6: Reports emerge that Clarkson and his wife, Frances, are getting divorced. May 6: Ofcom announce investigation into Top Gear episode featuring 'slope' remark'. July 28: Ofcom rules Clarkson had 'deliberately employed the offensive word to refer to the Asian person' and said there was  'insufficient context to justify the broadcast of this material'. December 27: Clarkson appears to poke fun at the Ofcom ruling, by telling Richard Hammond the Top Gear Christmas special: 'That is a proud moment, Hammond, but... is it straight?' as they drove on a makeshift bridge in Argentina. 'I'm sure they made this programme out of envy because of the rubbish country they have and the fact they like rubbishing everyone else.' It is the latest controversy to hit Clarkson, who was forced to apologise earlier this year when he was given a formal warning by the BBC about his conduct. The corporation apparently put him on his final warning in May for 'appearing' to use the n-word in unaired Top Gear footage. It came after the unaired footage of him using the 'eeny meeny' nursery rhyme to compare two sports cars was leaked to the media. Historically, the rhyme was 'Eeny meeny miny moe, catch a n***** by his toe', and Clarkson said he 'mumbled' in two takes to avoid using the racist term - which made it sound like he was saying it. In the third, which was broadcast, he said the word 'teacher' instead. In the wake of the scandal, he said: 'I've been told by the BBC that if I make one more offensive remark, anywhere, at any time, I will be sacked. Labour MP Jim Sheridan, a member of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said yesterday that Clarkson had been 'protected time and again by the BBC'. He told The Mirror: 'If any other employee behaved in the way that he has then they would have been sacked by now without a doubt. 'All the warnings he has had and yet it just keeps happening.' Top Gear has been at the centre of a number of controversies. In 2008, the show was rapped by the BBC Trust for showing Clarkson and fellow presenter James May sipping gin and tonic at the wheel during a stunt. During a press conference in Australia in February 2009, Clarkson branded then Prime Minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' In 2011, Hammond was discussing a Mexican sports car and suggested that vehicles reflect the national characteristics of the country they are from. He said: 'Mexican cars are just going to be lazy, feckless, flatulent, leaning against a fence asleep looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat.' The Mexican ambassador Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza did make a formal complaint to the BBC and called on the presenters to make a public apology for stirring 'bigoted feelings against the Mexican people'. The BBC declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline today.","Clarkson appears to reference 'slope' row in Top Gear Christmas special .

"Jo Hughes, 47, had hired Chris Boylan to refurbish her London flat, but was left with a 'nightmare' As a builder on 60 Minute Make-over, the popular ITV show hosted by Peter Andre, he is known for transforming homes in an hour. So Chris Boylan seemed the ideal choice when recently widowed mother-of-two Jo Hughes wanted her flat refurbished in record time. But she claims that what should have been an 11-day job turned into a nightmare lasting almost two months, with Mr Boylan bombarding her with demands for more cash while seemingly doing a shoddy job. A week into the project, she claimed, tiles had been poorly laid and marble worktops were fitted with uneven joins. Loose wires hung from half-plastered walls in the kitchen, while the junk-filled bathroom was in disarray. In another room, Mr Boylan and his team had allegedly left drinks bottles and other rubbish on the windowsills. Smashed fragments of tiling lay on the floor, she added. And that is the state in which Miss Hughes’ home was to remain. Because after three weeks Mr Boylan walked off the job, pocketing the £4,960 she had paid him. It was already £360 more than his original quote. Yesterday Miss Hughes, 47, of Southfields, South-West London, said she wanted to share her story as a warning to others. As well as 60 Minute Makeover, Mr Boylan had appeared on Channel 4’s You Deserve This House. He is also listed on the Star Now talent agency as an actor and Elvis impersonator. But Miss Hughes said he was demanding and careless and unwilling to do the work she was paying him for. She had to pay another £4,000 for a second group of builders to finish the job.

"Earth's 'twin', Venus, is now a barren world with a crushing atmosphere, acid raining from its skies and blistering temperatures of 480°C (890 °F). But scientists believe this hellish planet may once have had enough water in its atmosphere to cover its surface in an ocean 80ft (25 metres) deep. While the planet was too warm for that water to have fallen as rain, a new study suggests Venus may instead have had huge oceans of supercritical CO2, which were recently found to be capable of harbouring life. Hellish planet: While Venus was too warm for water to have fallen as rain, a new study suggests the now barren world (pictured) may have had huge oceans of supercritical CO2. Supercritical CO2 is created when liquids and gases reach their temperature and pressure thresholds, creating a fluid . 'Presently, the atmosphere of Venus is mostly carbon dioxide, 96.5 per cent by volume,' lead study author Dima Bolmatov, a theoretical physicist at Cornell University told Space.com. Supercritical CO2 is created when liquids and gases reach their temperature and pressure thresholds, creating a fluid that has features of both a liquid and gas. Supercritical CO2 is created when liquids and gases reach their temperature and pressure thresholds, creating a supercritical fluid that has features of both a liquid and gas. Carbon dioxide becomes supercritical when its temperature exceeds 305 degrees Kelvin (32°C) and its pressure goes beyond 72.9 - the standard atmosphere at sea level. On Earth, it's increasingly used in application such as dry cleaning or to sterilise medical equipment. A recent study claimed it could also be capable of sustaining life on planets without water, such as Venus. Scientists had previously thought the physical properties of supercritical fluids changed slowly with pressure and temperature. But computer simulations by Professor Bolmatov found this wasn't the case. The huge atmospheric pressures on Venus in its early days may have caused the supercritical carbon dioxide to look like soap bubbles, or as Professor Bolmatov puts it: 'A bubble of gas that is covered by a thick layer of liquid.' 'This in turn makes it plausible that geological features on Venus - like rift valleys, river-like beds, and plains - are the fingerprints of near-surface activity of liquid-like supercritical carbon dioxide,' Professor Bolmatov told Space.com. The discovery follows a study in November that found life could thrive in planet's that contain supercritical CO2. Professor Dirk Schulze-Makuch at Washington University compared enzymes in carbon dioxide and in water, and found that they were more stable in supercritical CO2. A study earlier this year argued that bacteria (pictured) could exist on planets that contain a 'supercritical' CO2.  If Venus did contain oceans of supercritical CO2, the planet may contain remnants of life . Supercritical carbon dioxide makes enzymes choosier about the molecules they bind to, leading to fewer side reactions. They also found that a number of species of bacteria are tolerant of supercritical carbon dioxide. Previous studies have found that microbes can live near liquid carbon dioxide trapped under Earth's oceans – and area where the fluid can become supercritical. If Venus did contain oceans of supercritical CO2, the planet may contain remnants of life.","Supercritical CO2 is a substance that has features of both a liquid and gas .

"The Abbott government has suffered a plunge in voter support across all states over the past year, latest polls show. The Newspoll analysis shows the Abbott government  is significantly behind Labor in two-party-preferred terms everywhere except Western Australia. Published in The Australian on Saturday, the analysis revealed the coalition's primary vote has tumbled 10 points in Victoria and South Australia, nine points in NSW, eight points in Queensland, and seven points in Western Australia. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his government has suffered a plunge in voter support across all states . In two-party preferred terms based on preference flows in the 2013 election, Labor leads the coalition by 60 per cent to 40 per cent in Victoria, by 54 to 46 per cent in both NSW and South Australia, and by 52 to 48 per cent in Queensland. Only in WA does the coalition have a two-party preferred lead - of 53 to 47 per cent. Tony Abbott is considered the better prime minister in WA, with a nine-point lead of 43 to 34 per cent and in Queensland with 41 to 39 per cent.

"If you have ever watched a child using an iPad with expertise eclipsing that of some adults, you may be forgiven for thinking young people are more tech savvy than ever before. But one engineer has dubbed young people a ‘lost generation’, incapable of fixing gadgets and appliances because they have grown up in a disposable world. Danielle George from  University of Manchester said people under the age of 40 expect gadgets to ‘just work’ and consequently are useless if they go wrong, replacing them with new devices instead of mending them. Lost generation: Electronics engineer Professor Danielle George (pictured) said that people under the age of 40 expect gadgets to ‘just work’ and consequently are useless if they go wrong, replacing them with new devices instead of mending them . The professor of Radio Frequency Engineering is giving this year’s prestigious Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in London. She claims most devices can be mended or repurposed with just a little knowledge of engineering and electronics and hopes to inspire television viewers who watch her lectures called: ‘Sparks will fly: How to hack your home’ to make, do and mend. In the lecture series, beginning tonight at 8pm on BBC Four, Professor George will examine three British inventions - the light bulb, a telephone and a motor. She will then show viewers how to transform them into extraordinary things, using everyday objects, as well as 3D printers, new materials and coding. The light bulb moment: Airs tonight, December 29, at 8pm pm BBC Four . Professor Danielle George will attempt to play a computer game on the windows of a skyscraper using hundreds of light bulbs. She explain how this is possible and show viewers how to send wireless messages using a barbecue, control a firework display with their your laptop and use a torch to browse the internet. Making contact: Airs on December 30 at 8pm, BBC Four . Inspired by Alexander Graham Bell, Professor George will try to beam a special guest into the theatre via hologram, using the technology found in a mobile phone. She will show viewers how to control paintball cannons with a webcam and turn their smartphone into a microscope, while also investigating a device that allows people to feel invisible objects in mid-air. A new revolution: Airs on December 31 at 8pm, BBC Four . Dr George will attempt to use simple motors to build a worldclass robot orchestra. She will explain how these robotic and motor-driven appliances work and show how they can adapted to help us kick start a technological revolution as well as showing viewers how to turn a washing machine into a wind turbine, how Lego can solve a Rubik’s Cube and how the next Mars rover will traverse an alien world. Professor George told The Telegraph: ‘We’ve got a lost generation that has grown up with factory electronics that just work all of the time. ‘All of these things in our home do seem to work most of the time and because they don’t break we just get used to them. The professor giving this year’s prestigious Royal Institution Christmas Lectures has dubbed young people a ‘lost generation’ who are incapable of fixing gadgets and appliances, because they have grown up in a disposable world. A pile of broken computer parts is pictured . Professor Danielle George is an Associate Dean for Teaching and Learning in the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences at the University of Manchester and a Professor of Radio Frequency Engineering. Her first degree was in Astrophysics and she then did a Masters in Radio Astronomy and PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. She was a Senior Electrical Engineer at Jodrell Bank Observatory until 2006. Professor George first became interested in engineering when she was given a telescope by her parents aged eight. 'I would get up in the middle of the night to watch lunar eclipses. It was the first time I realised how mathematics and physics could be used in a practical and useful way and I knew immediately that this kind of hands-on investigation was what I wanted to do in life,' she said. She now focuses on designing, testing and constructing instrumentation used in radio frequency and microwave communications systems by helping to design devices that transmit and receive huge volumes of information using radio waves, which is how mobile phones operate, or the much shorter microwaves, which is how satellite and deep space communications work. She is following in the footsteps of Michael Faraday and David Attenborough by giving the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures. ‘They have almost become like Black Boxes which never die. 'And when they do we throw them away and buy something new.’ However, she said there is an emerging community of people that enjoy remaking and repurposing things, such as a man who uses LEDs on his bike to write messages to motorists. She hopes young people will realise that they can change the world by inventing new devices. And there has never been a better time, because technology is improving at an incredible rate and many components and gadgets are relatively cheap, she added. 'Today’s generation of young people are in a truly unique position. They have never been more equipped to be creative and innovative,' she said in a blog post. 'I want young people to realise that they have the power to change the world from their own bedroom, kitchen table or garden shed. 'If we all take control of the technology around us and think creatively, then solving some of the world’s greatest challenges is only a small step away. 'I believe everyone has the potential to be an inventor.' It was a present of a telescope from her parents at the age of eight that first made Professor George appreciate how maths and physics can be used in a practical way. Gail Cardew, Director of Science and Education at the Royal Institution said: ‘Our aim is to bring to life the incredible ingenuity, innovation and creativity of engineering.’ The lectures, which were started in 1825 by Michael Faraday, have been taken by scientists including astronomer Carl Sagan and Sir David Attenborough. Professor George's first lecture, which is inspired by Geordie inventor Joseph Swan who is most famous for inventing the incandescent light bulb, will see her playing a computer game on the windows of a skyscraper using hundreds of light bulbs. She will also show viewers how to send wireless messages using a barbecue, control a firework display with a laptop. and use a torch to browse the internet. In following lectures, she will attempt to beam a holographic special guest to the theatre in London, using a smartphone, and use simple motors to make a robot orchestra. Other ‘how-tos’ will include how to turn a washing machine into a wind turbine, how Lego can solve a Rubik’s Cube, and how the next Mars rover will traverse an alien world. The first of this year’s lectures airs tonight on BBC Four at 8pm, with three more following until New Year’s Eve. Despite saying most people under the age of 40 haven't got a clue how to fix electronic devices and appliances, she said there is an emerging community of people that enjoy remaking and repurposing things and will show how coding (illustrated) and new technologies can be used to invent new objects, in her lecture .","Professor Danielle George, of the University of Manchester will give this year's Royal Institution Christmas Lecture Series .

"A New York father who has spent 18 months desperately trying and failing to rescue his two sons from Uruguay after they were kidnapped by his wife will shortly return to the United States. Guy Brunetti, 47, from Eastchester, flew to the South American country after his 42-year-old spouse, Ivanna Soto, then pregnant, abducted their toddler son, Octavio, now three, in May 2013. For the past year and a half, he has been fighting for the legal right to rescue Octavio, as well as his younger son, Luciano, whom he has never met and would now be 14 months old. But now, Mr Brunetti plans to return to the US within a month after an appeals court in Montevideo ruled he would not have the right to have Luciano brought back if he is ever found. Scroll down for video . Desperate: Guy Brunetti, 47, has spent 18 months desperately trying and failing to rescue his two young sons, including Octavio (center), from Uruguay after they were abducted by his wife, Ivanna Soto (right) in May 2013 . Devoted: Mr Brunetti (pictured with Octavio before his abduction), from Eastchester, New York, flew to the South American country after his 42-year-old spouse,  then four months' pregnant, fled there in May 2013 . Missing: For the past year and a half, the father has been fighting for the legal right to rescue Octavio (pictured), as well as his younger son, Luciano, whom he has never met and would now be 14 months old . However, despite the ruling, the devoted father has vowed to not give up his $70,000-plus fight to have his two children returned to New York, saying: 'I've hit a wall [but] the battle continues'. In a phone interview with The Journal News, he said: 'I'll probably come home to go to Washington and do some leg work there in the United States, then probably head back to Uruguay.' Last year, Mr Brunetti, who has been fighting for his sons while living in a Montevideo-based room that he rents weekly, was granted the right to have Octavio returned to the US by an appeals court. However, upon hearing of the decision, Ms Soto, a Uruguay native, dropped all contact with her husband and fled with their two sons. She is now a fugitive sought by Interpol. 'It's unexplainable,' Mr Brunetti told ABC News. 'It's this torture I live with every second, every minute, every hour of the day. It's a situation that no parent should have to go through.' Mr Brunetti started dating Ms Soto in 2009 after first meeting her in 1997. The pair initially lived in Uruguay, where they married and had Octavio, before moving to Eastchester for financial reasons. Before the abduction: But now, Mr Brunetti (pictured with Octavio) plans to return to the US within a month after an appeals court ruled he would not have the right to have Luciano brought back if he is ever found . Mother and son: A young Octavio is pictured with Ms Soto, who is now a fugitive who is sought by Interpol . Escape: Mr Brunetti has vowed to not give up his $70,000-plus fight to have his two children returned to New York, saying: 'I've hit a wall [but] the battle continues'. Above, Ms Soto fled from New York to Uruguay . On May 22, 2013, when Ms Soto was four months' pregnant, Mr Brunetti, an auto parts wholesaler, came home to find his wife had fled with Octavio. He flew to Uruguay and begged her to return. Having no luck, he filed a motion under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction to have his son returned to the US. The motion was granted on October 2, 2013. On November 27 this year, he lost a second legal battle to have the right to have Luciano returned. It remains unclear why Ms Soto initially fled the US, nor why she did not inform her husband. Happier times: 'It's unexplainable,' Mr Brunetti said of his desperate fight to rescue his sons. 'It's this torture I live with every second, every minute, every hour of the day.' Above, Mr Brunetti with Octavio as a baby .

"Most people feast on dishes brimming with turkey, potatoes and vegetables on Christmas Day. But this shocking photo shows what one 83-year-old care home resident was served instead. The pensioner was handed a plate containing a slice of bologna sausage, a piece of salami, some 'watered down' macaroni and a bread bun by staff at Pioneer Village in Saskatchewan, Canada. For dessert, he was given simply a bowl of 'runny' apple sauce. 'Unacceptable': This dish, containing a slice of bologna, a piece of salami, some 'watered down' macaroni and a bread bun, was given to an 83-year-old man at a Canada-based care home on December 25 . Shocked: The pensioner's horrified daughter, Darlene Mitchell (pictured, left, and, right, with her elderly mom), posted a photo of the meal on Facebook after visiting the publicly-run Regina facility with her partner, Shauna . His horrified daughter, Darlene Mitchell, posted a photo of the meal on Facebook after visiting the publicly-run Regina nursing home with her partner, Shauna, deeming the offering 'unacceptable'. Alongside the image, she wrote: 'So I wasn't going to do this on Christmas but I am doing this on Christmas. Tonight Shauna and I went to visit my dad in his care home. 'This is the meal they served the residence for Christmas supper. In case you can't tell what it is...it is a slice of bologna, a slice of salami, a bun and some watery macaroni salad. 'For dessert watered down apple sauce. So as always my mind isn't just angry it is curious... like who is in charge of meal planning. Do they say ok December 25 supper...bologna and a bun?' In response, the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region has stressed that Pioneer Village residents were served a hot traditional Christmas meal - including turkey and all the trimmings - earlier in the day. The later meal was, therefore, supposed to be cold and light, a spokesman said. Spreading the word: Alongside the image, Ms Mitchell wrote: 'Tonight Shauna and I went to visit my dad in his care home. This is the meal they served the residence for Christmas supper'. She then described the meal .

However, the photo, which also features a glass of still water and a small pack of butter, has sparked concern among thousands of social media users and politicians over Canada's care of the elderly. One Reddit user claimed her father - who resides at a different care facility - had simply been served canned meat for his Christmas dinner, while another said their relative was also served bologna. Meanwhile, others  raised concerns over the nutritional value of meals in the country's care homes. Speaking of the 'lack' of nutrition in her father's Christmas dinner, Ms Mitchell told CTV Regina: '(It) does not meet any nutritional guide whatsoever, especially on Christmas Day, but any day.' Expressing concern: Speaking of her father's 'unacceptable' Christmas dinner, Ms Mitchell told CTV Regina (pictured): '(It) does not meet any nutritional guide whatsoever, especially on Christmas Day, but any day' Giving their opinion: One Reddit user said: 'It's the overall nutritional quality that's the issue' at Pioneer Village . In agreement: Another claimed her father - who resides at a different care facility - had been served canned meat for his Christmas dinner, saying: 'The same situation has been my Dad's existence for three years' She added: 'It's dismal, it's depressing, it's sad and it's horrible that [this is how] these people are living the last years of their life. So what would I like changed? A hot meal.' The provincial NDP agreed that Ms Mitchell's father's meal fell short of acceptable standards for seniors' care - and has called for minimum-care standards in seniors facilities across the province. 'The meal that was served on Christmas Day is absolutely unacceptable,' said Opposition Deputy Leader Trent Wotherspoon, claiming it would not be appropriate on any day of the year. 'It doesn’t provide the basic nutrition. It doesn’t provide the dignity that those in care - that the seniors of this province, the builders of this province - deserve.'

"One way to preserve mental energy is by not agonising over needless decisions . The road to health is paved with good intentions. So why are we so easily diverted from the path of goodness by sugary snacks and lazy days on the sofa? The stark truth is that lack of willpower is often to blame. But new research shows why we shouldn't beat ourselves up about our backsliding. Willpower is a limited resource, the research reveals - there is only so much you have at any time. 'If we exert self-control and make a lot of willpower-related decisions, our self-control is lower and our capacity for making decisions drops,' explains Professor Roy Baumeister, the author of the bestselling book, Willpower, and a world expert on the subject. 'As you make decisions, you gradually deplete the energy you have available and your subsequent decisions are weaker.' So presented with just one too many temptations, and it really won't be your fault if you break your diet for that donught, it seems. Mercifully, there are simple ways to boost your willpower. The fragile state of human willpower was highlighted last month by researchers who found that men trying to give up tobacco smoked more  if shown photos of attractive females. Psychological tests revealed that not only were they significantly more distracted by sexual thoughts, but they also lit up twice as many cigarettes while completing surveys following the test. But why did pretty women make the volunteers' self-control go up in smoke? The researchers, from Taiwan's Kaohsiung Medical University, said the men had been put into a 'mating mindset' that distracted them from their long-term goal of abstinence. Scroll down for video . They were suffering from willpower depletion. This is that the theory that exercising self-control demands high levels of energy resources in the brain. We have finite resources at any one point, and if that energy is diverted, then restraint wilts. Some of the earliest evidence of this effect was discovered in 1998 by Professor Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University in Tallahassee. He invited volunteers into a room containing plates of cookies and a bowl of radishes. Half the volunteers were invited to eat the cookies, while the others were told to resist the treat and eat radishes instead. The volunteers were then given 30 minutes in which to tackle a difficult puzzle. The volunteers who resisted the cookies gave up on the puzzle after about eight minutes. The cookie-eaters persevered for an average of nearly 19 minutes. Volunteers who had gone for a walk ate half as much chocolate as those who had simply rested . Lacking the self-control to avoid sweet treats, or to stop smoking, is dangerous enough. More disturbingly, lack of long-term willpower also contributes to the way in which millions of people in Britain fail to keep taking daily medicines prescribed to treat life-threatening illnesses such as arthritis, hypertension and breast cancer. A survey by led by the University of Manchester published in August reported that more than a quarter of rheumatoid arthritis patients prescribed anti-inflammatory medication failed to take it properly within six months of the treatment's start. Meanwhile an analysis of patients' urine samples by the University of Leicester revealed in April that least one in four people with high blood pressure has abandoned their medication or takes too little to combat their risk of heart problems. Researchers are now trying to fathom why so many patients fail to take medicines that can so powerfully enhance their health. Unwanted side-effects must play an important part. But Leila Collins, a chartered counselling psychologist who has worked with patients on their ability to stick to medication says that lack of lasting willpower is an important factor. One basic problem is that patients' willpower fades over time as their powers of resolve fade and they begin to feel better thanks to the medication. So their resolution to keep to the prescribed regimen disappears before they get to the end of the course of drugs,' says Collins, who practises in North London and Hertfordshire. 'Some doctors are very good at putting the fear of God into patients, saying things such as ""Take your medicines or I won't be responsible for the what happens to you.""' But psychological research has found a range of less draconian, and rather surprising, ways in which people can boost the strength of their willpower. According to Professor Baumeister, one simple way to preserve your banks of mental energy is by not wasting it agonising over needless decisions. He cites the case of president Obama, who generally only wears blue or grey suits so that deciding what to wear is one decision he doesn't have to make. 'Likewise, you don't want to waste willpower making decisions about breakfast. Having a set morning routine is much better,' says he says. Another trick is to take short and simple exercise. A study performed at the University of Exeter, two years ago, set out to discover what might help people to resist the temptation of fattening foods. The investigators asked volunteers either to rest for 15 minutes or to spend the time going for a walk. They were then all asked to perform a series of dull but demanding computer tasks. Next to their keyboards was positioned a bowl of chocolates. At the end of the test, the researchers reported in the journal Appetite that the volunteers who had gone for a walk ate half as much chocolate as those who had simply rested. The researchers believe that light exercise energises people sufficiently to revive their brains' flagging resources and thus bolster their will power. Another scientifically backed way to boost willpower is to replenish your brain with fuel and rest. Glucose can help with this, according to a study in the journal Psychological Science in 2008. The Florida State University research showed that drinking sugar-sweetened lemonade restored flagging resolve in people whose willpower had been depleted by having to complete intelligence tests. Sugar-free lemonade did not bring the same benefit. You make decisions, deplete energy, and subsequent decisions are weaker . The research also indicates why crash-dieters are almost doomed to fail - their brains lack the fuel to keep their resolve going. Keeping up your glucose might help when you need willpower for quitting smoking, for example, but is obviously of little help if you are trying to stick to a diet. However, other research has shown that getting a full night's sleep significantly helps people to resist temptation the following day. This is because sleep plays an important role in regenerating levels of glucose in the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain that is associated with self-control, according to a study published in the journal, Organisational Behaviour and Human Decision Processes. But perhaps the most important way to boost your willpower is to convince yourself that you can be strong. This appears to work as a self-fulfilling belief. Several recent studies have demonstrated that volunteers who believe their reserves of self-control are inexhaustible perform much better in tests of willpower than people who think theirs can be worn out. Indeed, a study of 148 volunteers last year by Swiss and American psychologists in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has found that people who are convinced of the strength of their willpower can exercise far greater self-control while their brains are sugar-depleted than those who believe their resolve is prone to wavering. The research team, led by Dr Veronika Job, a psychologist at Zurich University, concluded that, 'People have far greater capacity to exert self-control than they may believe.' It's what our Edwardian forebears would have called developing one's 'moral backbone'. Indeed, when it comes to exercising willpower, one might do best to quote the carmaker Henry Ford, who famously once declared: 'Whether you think you can, or whether you think you can't, you're right.","Prof Roy Baumeister, author of book Willpower, is expert on the subject .

"Mystery: Archaeologist Dr Jacqui Wood has found dozens of witch pits including one believed to be from the 1970s . A secret coven of Cornish witches first formed in the 1640s has been digging pits lined with animal skins, bird carcasses and feathers as recently as the 1970s as part of a fertility ritual, it was revealed today. Archaeologist Jacqui Wood has discovered dozens of shallow rectangular holes near the hamlet of Saveock near Truro since 2003. Locals believe that two spinsters from the village, who died in the 1980s, were members of a coven of local witches who may have links to the pits and passed on their secrets. The freshest hole contains animal bones wrapped in a synthetic twine only used in Cornwall since the 1970s, which means the witch or witches who dug it are very likely to be alive, she says. Dr Wood's theory is that generations of local women have slaughtered and skinned animals and birds to help them fall pregnant. The earliest witch pit dates back to the 1640s and is lined with a slaughtered swan turned inside-out, claws from other birds and a small pile of stones. In ancient folklore the swan is a symbol of fertility and new life. Others were lined with the skins of animals like cats and dogs, and many have large numbers of birds eggs buried as the chicks were about to hatch. Remarkably the pits often contain a pile of  pebbles only found at Swanpool beach near Falmouth, which is 15 miles away from Saveock. Dr Wood believes that the pits may be an offering to St Brigid of Kildare in Ireland, the patron saint of newborn babies, dug by women who were struggling to get pregnant. Other theories involve witches who wanted to marry and have children. She told MailOnline: 'It is a faith system dating back at least 350 years and I believe it is linked to witchcraft. It is all still a secret, probably passed down from mother to daughter. Grim: The pits contain animal carcasses or in this case the wing of a swan and a set of egg. Swans are linked to folklore as symbols of rejuvenation and fertility . Symbols: Many of the holes contain eggs from a variety of birds all with chicks that were about the hatch while others contain the skins of animals and birds feathers, right . 'We know that one pit must have been dug in the 1970s. It contained orange baler twine invented in the 1960s and we know this was not used in Cornwall until the 1970s. Carbon dating of another pit shows that it was dug after the 1950s. 'There is an unbroken line from the 1640s to today. I think the people doing it now must still be alive. 'What's amazing is that these people must believe it works otherwise they would not still be doing it. And it is still being kept a secret after all these years. 'My own theory is that maybe if you got married and did not get pregnant in the first year, you might make an offering to St Bride of a feather pit. If you finally got pregnant you had to go back to the pit and take out the contents and burn them and set the spirit of the swan free. If you never got pregnant then the pit remained untouched'. The 40-or-so pits have been found by Dr Wood and her students in areas where there were reeds. The first one was found by accident in 2003 during the excavation of a neolithic platform. Theory: The tiny hamlet of Saveock, pictured, is near Truro and locals claim two spinsters who died in the 1980s were witches who may have links to the holes and passed the secrets on . At first they believed the hole was a failed attempt to plant a tree but then more digging found several more all roughly measuring 42cm long by 35cm wide and 17cm deep. Dr Wood believes because the land used is often wet it has helped people dig the holes quickly and hide the reeds allowed them to hide the pits easily. 'Every pit is very different but also remarkably similar. It is always involving fur and feather and often birds eggs where the chicks were ready to be born. There is also a small pile of stones, taken from by the sea 15 miles away', she said. Some have contained bones and the heads of goats or pigs. One had a scrap of newspaper containing the word Mussolini, who rose to power in the 1920s and was executed in 1945. The people who dug the pits would also have known they were breaking the law. The killing of swans has been illegal since the 11th century and witchcraft laws were only scrapped in 1951. Dr Wood said: 'We finally got a radio carbon date for one of the pits which was around 1640’s. That was the time of the Civil War and a dangerous thing to be doing when Cromwell’s army came to Cornwall as any sort of pagan worship was classed as witchcraft and punishable by death'. For centuries paganism and witchcraft was part of everyday life in Cornwall and peaked in the 19th century. The majority of communities had their own white witch who was seen as a form of public servant. These witches, also known as pellars, would protect families, get rid of curses and also cure illnesses. Commonly they would also bury offerings on behalf of people, like the pits found in Saveock. The most famous of these was Tamsin Blight, right, who lived from 1798 to 1856 in West Cornwall, and was known to have extraordinary powers to heal sick humans and animals. It was said that she once went to a graveyard and raised the spirit of a recently deceased woman for a male relative who wanted to know about his inheritance. The folk tale known as the 'The Ghost of Stythians' says she used a charmed ring and chanted incantations for some time before people heard a great crashing noise, screams of pain and felt a gust of wind before the woman's spirit rose from the grave and was questioned. One of Cornwall's main tourist attractions is the Museum of Witchcraft in Boscastle, which contains tales of witchcraft and artefacts. Its website sets out various spells and rituals that were used in the county and explained in stories and poems. One called the 'the hand of a suicide' explains how some believed the sick could be cured if they put their hands on the body of a man who had killed themselves. Others believed that touching the body of a person who was recently hanged had the same effect. Another ritual commonly used would involve someone who was ill walking over burning wood from a fire to cure terminal illnesses. One tradition involved the burning of ivy leaves or rushes to find out the future. A couple who wanted to know if they would marry would throw rushes on the fire. If the rushes burned together they would have a happy marriage, but if they split then that would be their fate, . Others used two ivy leaves, burying then in ashes, and used the number of cracks that appeared in woman's leaf to predict how many children they would have. The one that burned the longest would live the longest.","Dr Jacqui Wood has found dozens of witch pits in village of Saveock .

"A Massachusetts woman who lived in a squalid home where police said they found the skeletal remains of three babies pleaded not guilty Monday to two counts of murder. Erika Murray, 31, spoke clearly as she was arraigned Monday on nine charges. Superior Court Judge James Lemire ordered her held without bail. Her next court date is Feb. 4. The mother of seven children - four living, three deceased - had originally been charged with fetal death concealment. She had pleaded not guilty to that lower charge and has since been jailed on $1 million bail. Earlier this month, a grand jury indicted Murray on the nine counts. The charges also include two counts of assault and battery on a child causing substantial bodily injury, two counts of reckless endangerment of a child, two counts of cruelty to animals and one count of concealing a fetal death. Scroll down for video . Court appearance: Erika Murray is arraigned on 2 counts of murder and other charges in Worcester Superior Court on Monday . Discovery: Murray was found living with the skeletal remains of three babies in a squalid Blackstone, Massachusetts home . Murray's lawyer, Keith Halpern, has said there's no evidence she caused the deaths of the three babies. Prosecutors said Murray gave birth to the five youngest children in the house's bathroom, attempting to hide their existence from their father because he did not want to have more children. She appears to have kept them almost entirely in upstairs bedrooms filled with trash. The children 'weren't the only captives in this house,' he said after Monday's hearing. 'She was too. ... She was mentally ill to the point where she was incapable of doing anything. The house looked the way it looked because she was sick.' Halpern continued: 'If she was determined to murder these children, why did they find three corpses and not five? ... It does not make sense to portray her as a serial child killer.' Falling apart: The house was infested with rodents and insects, piled high with dirty diapers and contained dead animals . Knocked down: Workers in hazmat suits spent days cleaning out the house, which was later demolished . The two murder charges relate to two dead infants, who were found wearing diapers and one-piece infant outfits. The other set of remains were of a fetus, authorities have said. All three were found in bedroom closets. Halpern argued in court for Murray's release until trial, saying that prosecutors had not made a case for keeping her in isolation in a women's prison. But Assistant District Attorney John Bradley argued that the circumstances of the case, including the deplorable living conditions in the house and the health of the surviving children, were reasons enough. Bradley said the dead fetus had the placenta and umbilical cord still attached; a 3-year-old could neither talk nor walk, was severely malnourished and had maggots in her ears; and a nearly 6-month-old appeared to have spent much of her young life on her back. State police entered the Blackstone home on Sept. 10 after a neighbor had discovered the older children severely neglected. Police found the house contained dead animals, was infested with rodents and insects and was piled high with dirty diapers and trash. Workers in hazmat suits spent days cleaning out the house, which was eventually condemned and demolished. Murray's four living children, who ranged in age from 5 months to 13 years when they were removed from the home in September, are in the custody of state child welfare officials. Raymond Rivera, Murray's boyfriend and the father of the children, has pleaded not guilty to seven charges, including two counts of assault and battery causing substantial bodily injury and two counts of reckless endangerment of a child. He claims he lived in the basement and was unaware of the conditions in the rest of the house, let alone the existence of two of the children - an argument that prosecutors contest. Rivera, 38, is being held on $100,000 bail. He is due back in court on Jan. 14.

"Although America carried President Obama confidently into a second term last Tuesday - not everyone is jumping for joy at the prospect of four more years. Tens of thousands have put their names to secession petitions in 20 states, asking that they peacefully become independent from the rest of the country. The documents have been lodged on a government website We The People - and Texas has almost enough people behind its petition to warrant an official White House response. Bid for freedom: People from the states marked in red have lodged petitions asking to break away from the rest of the United States since Obama returned to the White House . Along with the Lone Star state, petitions were filed from Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina and Tennessee. So keen are the folks in Georgia for a separation, that they filed their petition twice. Unsurprisingly, the majority of these states voted for Republican nominee Mitt Romney although petitions were also lodged in Democrat strongholds such as New York and Oregon. Texas has gained the most so far with 23,000 people backing the wish to form an independent government. The right to petition the U.S. government is guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution. If there is enough support - 25,000 signatures are needed - then it is sent to policy experts within the administration. Other petitions are currently filed on the website including ones to 'Officially recognize American Sign Language as a community language and a language of instruction in schools', another to 'regulate internet pornography' and 'stop the drone strikes'.

"The family of a Marine murdered on a  military base are now suing the Department of Defense to get more information on their late son's death by an Afghani teen who was supposed to be his ally. Lance Cpl Greg Buckley, 21, and two other Marines were gunned down on August 10, 2012, while working out in the gym at Forward Operating Base Delhi, in Afghanistan's Helmand province. The 17-year-old 'tea boy' who carried out the attack using an AK-47 was given permission to enter the base as a 'personal assistant' to an Afghani police chief who lived alongside the U.S. troops and was later accused of aiding the Taliban. Scroll down for video . What really happened? The family of Lance Cpl Greg Buckley, who was shot dead by an Afghani teen on a military base, are now suing the military for more information on his death. Above, the Marine's father Greg Sr (left), mother Marine (center) and two brothers attend his funeral in August 2012 . Accusations: Buckley's father Greg Buckley Sr (left) has accused the military of covering up the truth about his son's (right) death, saying he believes they could have prevented the shooting if they listened to a warning from a fellow Marine . Two years later, Buckley's family still haven't received autopsy or investigative reports on their son's death - though they are entitled to these documents under federal law. The Long Island, New York family are now filing a lawsuit against the Marine Corps, Department of Defense, the Navy, the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service and former Marine Corps Commandant Gen James Amos, accusing the defendants of withholding the full truth surrounding their son's death. Buckley's father Gregory Buckley Sr believes the military could have prevented his son's death if they had listened to warning's about the so-called Afghani allies who were granted wide-spread access to the base - with some even living there. Safe? Above, a picture of the Forward Operating Base Delhi in Afghanistan's Helmand Province where Buckley and two fellow Marines were killed in August 2012 . Warning: Buckley's father says fellow Marine Jason Brezler issued a warning about the sketchy dealings of an Afghani police chief named Sarwar Jan who lived on the base to troops stationed back in Afghanistan. Brezler (left) pictured above with Jan (right) 'He says we have a bad feeling that we are not going to be able to ever get home. I think these people here are going to turn on us. He says they're just not right,' Buckley told Fox News. Buckley was just three days away from a surprise visit home when he was shot dead in the base's gym where he was supposed to be safe. Staff Sgt Scott Dickinson and Cpl Richard Rivera were also killed in the attack. The perpetrator of the attack was a 17-year-old Afghani named Aynoddin, who was granted access to the base as a 'personal assistant' to local police chief Sarwar Jan - a resident of the base. Other victims: Staff Sgt Scott Dickinson (left) and Cpl Richard Rivera (right) were also killed in the August 2012 attack on the Helmand base . It was later revealed that the teen may have been one of the sex slaves that Jan supposedly brought onto the base. He was not vetted and later talked about killing the soldiers in the name of Jihad. Aynoddin was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison. Before the attack, a fellow Marine named Jason Brezler warned his comrades stationed overseas about Jan's shady background in an email. Brezler was subsequently honorably discharged for sending the email from his personal, unsecured, Yahoo account. 'He shot my son point blank with an AK-47. Shot him four times in his chest and once in his neck. He was in the gym with a pair of shorts and a tank top on,' Buckley Sr said. 'How is that allowed?' Buckley Sr says he now wants the military to step up and acknowledge that they were at fault. 'I want them to admit that they were wrong. And I want someone to be held responsible for my son's death.' Loss of a son: Above, Greg's father is overcome with emotion at his son's funeral, which was held at St Agnes Cathedral .

"You may not have noticed how tricky it is to snap a single strand of dried spaghetti in half, but the phenomenon has baffled leading physicists for decades - including a Nobel Prize winner. But now one engineer has filmed spaghetti fracturing at 250,000 frames per second (fps) to explain why this happens. The YouTube star found that vibrations do not cause the spaghetti to shatter - as previously suggested. Instead, as it tries to ‘straighten itself out,’ the pasta forms cascading fractures and rapidly breaks into multiple pieces as its bent. Scroll down for video . Break point: An engineer has filmed strands of spaghetti being snapped at 250,000 frames per second (pictured) in order to explain why it doesn't ever snap in two halves, when it's bent from the tips. It seems that the fracturing is like a chain reaction of destructive un-twisting of the pasta . This theory applies to a single strand of spaghetti that is held at each end before being bent. If the hands are moved closer together on the strand, the outcome can differ. On his YouTube channel, Smarter Every Day, Destin Sandlin set out to explore why a single strand of spaghetti doesn’t break in half, but instead shatters into at least three pieces when bent from the tips. Generally, rods - such as a pencil - eventually break into two if they are bent. This happens when the top of the rod exceeds the maximum allowable tensile stress, which is the state of stress that leads to expansion. When a piece of spaghetti was bent to breaking point, and the process was filmed at 250,000 frames per second, it was revealed that smaller broken pieces of pasta rotate away from the first fracture, and the ‘back’ of a piece of spaghetti moves 'downwards'. Engineer Destin Sandlin explained that the spaghetti strand is trying to straighten itself out, because it twists when it is bent into a curve. When a first break occurs, the piece that breaks off from the main strand untwists, but the remaining longer section is more twisted than before, triggering one or more fractures - causing it to break into more than three pieces. ‘With every break, the process starts once again, which is called a cascading fracture,' he explained. So the fracturing is like a chain reaction of destructive un-twisting . This theory applies to a single strand of spaghetti that is held at each end before being bent. If the hands are moved closer together on the strand, the outcome can differ. But spaghetti’s unusual shattering process has stumped scientists for years, including Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynmann, who worked on the Manhattan Project. If you snap a strand of spaghetti, you feel a tiny vibration on your finger as it curves, leading Dr Feynmann to suggest the vibration may 'excite' the spaghetti enough to cause a secondary fracture. This means that he thought an elevation in energy levels at a molecular or atomic level was to blame. But, upon testing this theory under water to dampen the vibration, the spaghetti still broke in the same way - discounting this theory. Since his efforts, some physicists and mathematicians have worked to solve the mystery. In 2006, two physicists from the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, won the Ig Nobel Prize for Physics for their work in explaining spaghetti shattering. They applied a mathematical calculation called the Kirchoff equation, which explains how waves travel through an object that's under stress. The physicists found that that spaghetti fragmentation is caused by 'flexural waves' (bending waves) traveling through the pasta after the first break. This causes a wave to travel down the remaining strand of spaghetti before it can relax and un-twist. Mr Sandlin began filming pasta snapping at 18,000 fps using a high-speed camera to test the theory, but at this speed, both fractures seemed to happen simultaneously within a millisecond, giving him few clues. Destin Sandlin (in the video) noticed that the smaller broken pieces of pasta seem to rotate away from the first fracture, and the ‘back’ of a piece of spaghetti held horizontally, appears to break downwards, after he flexed a strand to break it . At 40,000 fps - 10 times faster than previous research - it was possible to see which fracture occurred first in a ‘snap,’ leading him to say: ‘It appears that the longer rods aren’t vibrating on the same timescale.' He noticed that the smaller broken pieces of pasta seem to rotate away from the first fracture, and the ‘back’ of a piece of spaghetti held horizontally, appears to break downwards. 'It's almost as if the spaghetti is trying to straighten itself out but it can't overcome its own mass,’ he explained in the video. He found that a strand of spaghetti twists as it is bent, making it bend into a deep curve. ‘When a break occurs, the piece near the side near the break is free from torque,’ Mr Sandlin said, which means, it is no longer twisted. ‘It starts to straighten itself out from left to right, rotating up and straightening out along the way.’ In the video, the longer piece of spaghetti which is yet to break, is still curved and twisted and at the point that the first fracture occurred, the spaghetti is even more curved than it was before, causing another fracture almost immediately. ‘With every break, the process starts once again, which is called a cascading fracture,’ he said. So the fracturing is similar to a chain reaction of destructive untwisting, which leaves the spaghetti broken into pieces instead of snapping in two. His video confirms the work by the physicists at Marie Curie University.","Destin Sandlin filmed spaghetti snapping at 250,000 frames per second .

"Alcohol can turn the quietest of people into exhibitionists, who, with the help of a karaoke machine can belt out hits such as ‘I will survive’ at the top of their lungs while slurring the words. Now, scientists have discovered that alcohol has a similar effect on birds, whose songs become slurred and less well defined when they are under the influence. The birds were given spiked juice and their songs carefully analysed for the tell-tale hallmarks of drunkenness. The Birdie Song, or anything by Wings: Scientists gave zebra finches (stock image) juice spiked with alcohol and analysed the effect on their songs, to find that they were slurred and quieter than usual . Christopher Olson, of Oregon Health and Science University described an experiment where zebra finches were given juice with six per cent alcohol, on National Public Radio’s All Things Considered show. They wanted to explore whether alcohol affects the songs of birds in the same way it does humans. Zebra finches are commonly used to model human vocal learning and unravel how people communicate. Dr Olsen told broadcaster Arun Rath: 'At first we were thinking that they wouldn't drink on their own because, you know, a lot of animals just won't touch the stuff. But they seem to tolerate it pretty well and be somewhat willing to consume it.’ The unusual experiment set out to find out whether alcohol affects the songs of birds in the same way it does humans. A stock image of people in a karaoke bar is pictured . The birds had blood alcohol levels of between 0.05 and 0.08 per cent, which may not sound a lot, but produced the effects of drunkenness, because of the way that birds metabolise alcohol. Birds could feasibly become 'drunk' in the wild, if they eat a lot of fermenting berries. In the experiment, the scientists observed that the songs of the birds got quieter and became a little slurred, under the influence of the spiked juice. Dr Olsen said: ‘[They became] ‘a bit less organised in their sound production,’ in the same way that humans slur their words and songs in a distinctive way. In the future, he plans on exploring whether alcohol not only alters the way birds sing, but if it alters the way they learn new tunes too. The Hermit thrush may well be the Beyoncé of the bird world thanks to its tuneful melodies, a study revealed last month. Scientists have discovered that the North American songbird sings in 'harmonic series', a pattern of pleasing-sounding notes commonly used in popular human music. By studying how birds sing, experts hope to learn how much of human musical heritage is shaped by biology, compared to culture. A harmonic series stems from a base note and is followed by notes that increase in pitch, based on multiples of the original note. Scientists have discovered that the hermit thrush (stock image) sings in 'harmonic series', a pattern of pleasing-sounding notes commonly used in popular human music . Scientists found that around 70 per cent of the bird’s songs followed this pattern, Smithsonian reported. Male hermit thrushes  sing between six and 10 types of song, which tend to be high-pitched and fast, beginning with a long whistle, the study revealed. Emily Doolittle, a composer at Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle and Tecumseh Fitch, a biologist at the University of Vienna, analysed 144 different song types from 14 male hermit thrushes. ‘Listening to the songs full speed, they are very attractive, but we didn’t have any inkling that we would hear the harmonic series in them,' Dr Doolittle said. But after they slowed them down, the harmonic series patterns became clear and statisticians analysed the bird’s choices of pitch in the song. Around 70 per cent of the songs analysed followed harmonic intervals, compared to just five per cent which seemed to include random notes. Dr Doolittle emphasised that the birds don’t deliberately compose their songs using scales, but noted that other birds also like intervals used in human music. For example, previous studies have shown that musical wrens use them and domestic chickens favour consonant notes – a combination of notes that sound pleasant when played at the same time.","Scientists from the Oregon Health and Science University gave zebra finches alcoholic juice and analysed the effect on their singing .

"Sony executive Amy Pascal has said she hopes the box office success of The Interview will help save her job. The Interview, which had previously been pulled by Sony, made $15million in online rentals over the weekend, as well as $2.8million from theatres. Ms Pascal has been under constant fire after cyber attackers breached Sony's computer network in November, releasing a slew of her email exchanges. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Sony executive Amy Pascal, pictured at LAX on Saturday, hopes The Interview will save her job . One particular email conversation between Ms Pascal and Hollywood film producer Scott Rudin appeared to mock Barack Obama. The emails, initiated by Ms Pascal, suggested that the President would prefer movies such as Django and 12 Years A Slave and films starring black actors. Another set of emails released saw Ms Pascal call Hollywood actor Adam Sandler an 'a**hole'. The Sony Pictures Chair addressed her work situation as she touched down at Los Angeles International Airport on Saturday. When asked by photographers if the u-turn on the decision to not to release The Interview would 'be enough to save your job', Ms Pascal replied: 'I hope so', the New York Post reports. Shamed:  Pascal spoke about about this weekend's release of the controversial assassination comedy as she jetted into LAX after her Christmas vacation . Digital demand: James Franco and Seth Rogen are shown in a still from The Interview that has found success with online sales and rentals of $15 million . The Interview took $15million in online rentals, and also hauled in $2.8million from 331 theaters since opening on Christmas Day with $1.8million taken in over the weekend. The political comedy starring James Franco and Seth Rogen, who also co-directed and co-wrote, was set for a wide release on Christmas Day on about 3,000 screens but was given a limited release in the wake of the Sony Pictures cyber attack. Sony also made the movie available onine via YouTube, Xbox Video and Google Play. The Interview has been rented or downloaded more than two million times since being released online on Tuesday, according to an article on Sunday by Variety. It quickly became Sony's highest grossing online release ever. The Interview also surpassed other recent video on demand success stories such as the Chris Evans post-apocalyptic drama Snowpiercer that has earned $7 million on demand. 'I'm so grateful that the movie found its way into theaters, and I'm thrilled that people actually went out and saw it,' Rogen said in a statement. 'We are very pleased with how it is doing both theatrically where we are seeing numerous sell-outs across the country, and online where it remains at the top of many charts,' added Rory Bruer, Sony's president of worldwide distribution. Controversial: A series of leaked emails revealed that Amy Pascal, pictured center, had referred to actor Adam Sandler, left, as an 'a**hole' Limited release: The Interview finished in 16th place at the box office with $2.8 million in limited release . Live tweet: Seth Rogen, James Franco and co-direct Evan Goldberg took part in a live tweet on Sunday while watching The Interview . However, Sony appears to have taken some security measures regarding the film, after it was revealed that  producers cut a scene depicting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un participating in a gay orgy. The scene was described in a version of The Interview's script released in the hack attack in November, but did not appear in the film. Sony staff who spoke with The Sunday Times called the version released last week a 'redacted version' and expressed hopes that the full unedited movie would be released on DVD in a 'director's cut version'. Sony initially decided not to release The Interview after an alleged cyber attack by North Korea on their internal system on November 24. Hackers released several upcoming Sony movies as well as personal details of thousands of employees and the various aliases used by celebrities when they book into hotels to protect their anonymity.","Sony's Amy Pascal has said she 'hopes' The Interview will save her job .

"For a favourite toy, some dogs will do anything. Diving head first into a swimming pool, these animals don't let a bit of water keep them from their balls and chew figures. The steely determination of the petshave been captured by underwater portrait and dog photographer Jonny Simpson-Lee. Photographer Jonny Simpson-Lee has captured dogs diving into a swimming pool to catch their toys . Mr Simpson-Lee said the determination and expression of the dogs shows their primeval hunting instinct . The 42-year-old, of Pulborough, West Sussex, decided to combine his love of dogs with his passion for underwater photography and place himself at the bottom of a hydrotherapy pool, alongside some treasured dog toys. 'Freezing the moment a dog breaks through the surface of the water in pursuit of a toy or treat often captures it's primeval hunting instinct and is exaggerated by the way its body takes on fascinating forms within the water,' said Mr Simpson-Lee. Mr Simpson-Lee started photographing dogs when he launched a new business that was meant to capture babies swimming underwater. He said: 'I found it impossible to persuade anyone to allow me to put a dog in their pool for me to photograph until a chance meeting in a shop with a canine hydrotherapist allowed my dream to become a reality. 'I suggested we gather some dogs who were keen swimmers and produce a calendar of underwater dogs, we only had a couple of weeks to organise the shoot, but it was a great success.' After the canine calendar the success continued and Mr Simpson-Lee joined forces with House of Hugo, a hotel and training facility for dogs in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex. The hotel's hydrotherapy pool provided the perfect location to photograph pets underwater. The animals have been photographed in stealthy pursuit of their favourite toys and balls under the water . Mr Simpson-Lee said he enjoyed capturing the movement and expressions of the dogs as they dived . The animals have been pictured jumping into a swimming pool - very different from lakes and the sea . He added: 'It's difficult to predict the exact spot a dog will enter the water so I target my camera on a toy floating on the surface whilst the owner or assistant keeps the dog from jumping in. 'Once I'm ready and happy the dog is focused on its toy, I call for the dog to be released. 'The process is repeated several times to allow for me to achieve a variety of perspectives. 'One of the most rewarding aspects of my work is to observe the amazing reactions my pictures evoke, especially from a client seeing their own dog captured in this unusual perspective. Dogs seemed excited and determined to capture their favourite toys, however far they sunk in the water . Some dogs surprise their owners by teetering on the edge of swimming pools while others go straight in . 'Although people find my pictures compelling, a handful of people have said they find some of my photos ""scary.''' Mr Simpson-Lee said one of the key problems he faces is dogs that will not take part, looking gingerly over the edge of the water instead. He added: 'Often an owner will come to me believing their dog will dive straight in as it loves swimming in the sea, rivers or ponds. 'However, a swimming pool can be an alien environment for many dogs as the water is clear and smells very different.'","Jonny Simpson-Lee, 42, is an underwater portrait and dog photographer .

"Two hospital workers spent four hours pinned between a highly magnetic MRI machine and a metal oxygen tank. The 4ft tank was pulled across the room by the machine's magnetic field at Tata Memorial Hospital in New Delhi, India, leaving porter Sunil Jadhav and technician Swami Ramaiah seriously injured. Hospital authorities launched an investigation into the incident, which was reportedly exacerbated when staff found they were unable to demagnetise the machine. Painful: Two hospital staff (pictured) were pinned between an MRI scanner and an oxygen tank in New Delhi . Fracture: Sunil Jadhav, 28, reportedly misunderstood instructions to fetch an oxygen mask for the doctor . The incident last month was triggered while a patient was being wheeled in for a routine scan in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. The 28-year-old porter was asked to fetch an oxygen mask but thought he was being asked to fetch a whole tank, the Mumbai Mirror reported. It was drawn across the room, pinning him and the technician to the machine and fracturing his elbow. The technician, 35, suffered damage to his lower abdomen described in one report as a punctured bladder and severe bleeding. Normally the incident could have been over within seconds, but the machine's emergency shut-off switch failed to work, hospital authorities said. That meant the men were trapped for four hours, during which both fell unconscious and were treated for their injuries while still pinned to the machine. A team of rescuers was called and at one point 20 people tried to pull the cylinder out with a rope they had attached to the end, according to local reports. Treatment: Technician Swami Ramaiah, 35, remained in hospital after suffering a punctured bladder . Eventually, they were rescued after a technician from manufacturer General Electric managed to deactivate the magnetic field, a hospital spokesman said. Hospital deputy director Dr Sudeep Gupta said in a press statement: 'We are taking up the issue of the equipment malfunction with General Electric in an appropriate manner. 'One of the men has suffered a fracture in elbow and has been operated on. The other suffered muscular injury to the lower limbs and will take a few weeks to recover.' Later reports suggested the switch had been disabled so it could only be operated by GE employees. A GE spokesman declined to confirm or deny that claim, but said: 'At this time, we are not aware of any systemic safety concerns with the GE MRI currently in the installed base - this was a unique incident. 'Wipro GE Healthcare provides extensive training on usage of MRI equipment to ensure safety of patients and hospital staff... and is taking this matter seriously.' MRI scanners use powerful magnetic fields to manipulate protons in the water molecules which make up much of the human body. Radio-frequency waves are then directed at the patient to determine the position of the protons and how they have 'lined up' under the magnetic field, building up a detailed picture of different types of tissue in the body. The magnetic fields needed are so strong that MRI scanners always bear explicit warnings that they should not be kept near any metal objects, even paperclips. MRI scanners tend to have a magnetic strength of between 1.5 and 3 Tesla - compared to just 0.005 Tesla for a fridge magnet.","Pair were working at the Tata Memorial Hospital in New Delhi, India .

"It was shot into space six months ago, with the promise that the finder would be able to keep the £12,000 prize. But when a sparkling diamond lost contact with a GPS signal it was thought to have been lost forever, leaving dozens of disappointing hunters in its wake. And married couple Allan and Pat Bell now have their inquisitive dog to thank for finding the perfect Christmas present while out on a walk in Lincolnshire - the missing 1.14 carat diamond. Scroll down for video . Allan Bell and his dog Rosie found a 1.14 carat diamond in Lincolnshire that had been fired into space . The diamond was sent into space as part of a PR stunt and was launched into the air in August this year . The couple also almost missed their chance to claim the diamond after Mr Bell first left the box, thinking it was too much hassle to remove. He then raced back when he remembered what it was. The rock was shot into the air as part of a PR stunt in August. It was put in a helium balloon which was expected to pop when the precious cargo reached 100,000ft, causing it to fall down back to the earth. However as it fell, attached to a distinctive orange parachute, the GPS signal was lost and the precious gemstone appeared to have vanished. Mr Bell, 75, was out walking his two dogs, springer spaniel Rosie and Dylan, a Saluki cross, along a country path in the village of Brattleby, Lincolnshire, when Rosie 'got scent of something' and quickly ran under a hedge. Mr Bell, a retired lorry driver, said Rosie was 'scrabbling about' for 10 minutes before dragging a package - attached to a limp orange parachute - out of the hedgerow on December 23. The pensioner said: 'I was walking Rosie and Dylan along a country path and nosey Rosie suddenly darted under a hedge and got a hold of something big. 'She took about 10 minutes dragging it our from under the hedge and I saw that it was covered in mud and leaves. The precious gemstone was launched attached to a helium balloon and orange parachute and was meant to float back to earth so it could be found, but as it descended the GPS signal with the craft was lost . Mr and Mrs Bell have just celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary and will probably sell the diamond . 'I didn't fancy carrying it for the rest of the walk, so decided to leave it until we walked back along the road on our way home.' It wasn't until about 30 minutes later that Mr Bell realised it could be the diamond everyone was searching for and he dashed back to the hedge to retrieve the package. He added: 'I looked a bit closer and saw the package had an orange parachute underneath it and details of who to contact written on it - and I knew it must be the diamond. 'I got back to the car and drove home to open it up in a state of some excitement.' The diamond was thought to have landed within a five mile radius of the village of Lea in Lincolnshire - about 10 miles from Brattleby - in August and thousands of treasure hunters flocked to the area to search for the valuable gem with no success. When Mr Bell got home he told his wife of 25 years, Pat and they opened the box to find the diamond inside and a number to call. Mr Bell said his dog Rosie, a springer spaniel, got a scent for something and pulled the diamond from a bush . The diamonds were launched in August with the promise that whoever found the box could keep the gems . Mrs Bell called bosses at 77 Diamonds, which organised the stunt, telling them her husband had found the missing sparkler under a hedge. She was congratulated on the find, but has yet to decide on whether to have the 1.14 carat diamond set in a ring or sell it. She said: 'Allan and I have kept our eyes open since the diamond went missing, but everyone was looking for the diamond around the village of Lea, so Allan never expected to find it in Brattleby, which is about 10 miles away. 'I couldn't believe it when we opened it up - you could have knocked me down with a feather. 'I suppose if I led a glamorous lifestyle I would be wearing it out and about in all the best places, but I don't lead a rip-roaring lifestyle, so such a beautiful diamond might be wasted on me. 'Allan got me a lovely bracelet for my Christmas, but this diamond has trumped it - just a bit!' The box was launched from a remote village in Derbyshire and was expected to descend hours later . But the diamond failed to return where it was expected and was thought to have been lost . The couple are planning to sell the diamond and go on a Mediterranean cruise to celebrate their silver wedding anniversary. Mr Bell, who worked as a lorry driver for 44 years, said Rosie - and Dylan - would be getting a special treat, adding: 'Both the dogs will get something special. 'I imagine a rib-eye steak would go down well - it's the least they deserve.' Bruce Linegar, a member of Lea Parish Council and a former policeman for the village, said excitement had 'swept through the village' when news got out about the diamond in August. The £12,000 diamond was hand-picked for its 'brilliance and sparkle' and is a 'modified cushion brilliant cut', similar to the engagement rings of Kim Kardashian and Jessica Biel. Bosses at 77 Diamonds, which takes its name from the first ever diamond engagement ring given by Archduke Maximilian I of Austria to Mary of Burgundy in 1477, say the 'stunt' was to raise awareness of the firm's access to 80 per cent of the world's finest polished diamonds. The diamond is similar to the sparkling engagement rings worn by Jessica Biel and Kim Kardashian . Tobias Kormind, co-founder of 77 Diamonds said: 'Having launched the diamond into space back in August we were starting to doubt whether it would ever be found. 'It really captured the imagination of the nation at the time and we were overwhelmed by the thousands of people who joined in the treasure hunt to find it. 'We were very surprised to receive the call from Pat after so many months of searching and just find it even more remarkable that it should be discovered at Christmas. 'This, coupled with the fact that Pat and her husband Allan are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary makes it even more wonderful. 'We hope they get great pleasure from the diamond and enjoy recounting their exciting story of discovered treasure.'","A 1.14 carat diamond was shot into space in August, attached to a balloon .

"A group of Russian divers has braved freezing conditions to celebrate the coming New Year underwater. Divers from far eastern city of Vladivostok placed a decorated New Year tree on the bottom of the nearly-frozen Shchitovaya Bay in the Ussuriysky Gulf. Despite the water temperature being zero degrees Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) and the surface of the bay covered with ice, the divers decided to celebrate with an underwater ceremony. Dressed in festive Santa Claus hats, the group is seen struggling to carry a decorated Christmas tree into the water, which is frozen over in parts. They then submerge themselves in the Shchitovaya Bay to celebrate the forthcoming New Year underwater. Drinking champagne from the bottle and performing a traditional Russian round dance around the New Year tree underwater, the dive was the fifth time the Vladivostok divers decided to conduct the celebration.

"This is the adorable moment a baby harp seal braved the icy water as it went swimming for the very first time. The fluffy two-week-old harp seal looked initially reluctant to get in as it tentatively waited on the ice as its mother swam in the icy waters below. Minutes later the pup cautiously tested the water by dipping it's head below the surface before it totally submerged itself following encouragement from its mother. Head first: Braving the icy conditions the seal pup places its head in the water, but is not yet ready to take the full-body plunge . So happy together: Having taken the plunge, the pup's mother rewards the bravery with a playful nudge in the water . Anything down there? The pup edges closer and closer to the waters edge and looks down on its mother swimming below . No way mum: The pup calls out to its mother who has already dived below the ice to show the youngster how its done . The mother seal can then be seen gently guiding the pup in the icy waters before rewarding her brave pup with an affectionate nudge on the nose. Baby harp seals are taught to swim at a very young age as there's a risk the ice could break at any time. Photographers Jennifer Hayes and David Doubilet captured the pups big dip in the Gulf of St Laurence, near Magdalen Island in Canada. The couple spent 10 days photographing the seals and even braved the freezing waters themselves to capture the magic moments. Ms Hayes said she was even bitten by a seal in her pursuit as she patiently waited to capture the maiden plunge. Harp seals nurse their pups for 12 to 15 days after giving birth, then abandon them so their young learn how to eat, swim and fend for themselves. Ms Hayes said: 'It's a tough beginning in a tough environment.' Frosty top: The seal pup emerges from the water with a thin layer of ice sprinkled across its head and snout . Ms Hayes said on the last day of her expedition, she and her partner entered the water themselves. It was then that they spotted the pup taking its very first swim. She said: 'I found a baby harp seal on the edge of the ice floe looking for its mother. The mother swept past me in a fury of fur and coaxed the white pup into the water a few feet in front of me. 'I kicked along with the mother and pup as they swam for the safety of another ice floe. 'The curious pup would try to swim toward me and the mother used her flipper to physically hold it back. As we moved through the ice, the pup and I became closer and closer.' In the end, Ms Hayes couldn't have asked for a closer encounter. She said: 'We stopped and the pup climbed onto me to rest. I floated on my back as the pup sprawled heavily on my chest, and its face nuzzled my mask.'","Harp seals abandon their young after 12-15 days, so they learn to swim, eat and fend for themselves .

"Up to nine Eurosceptic ministers are to demand that David Cameron grants them the freedom to campaign for Britain to leave the EU if the Conservatives remain in power after the general election. Several Tory members of the Cabinet are thought to back a British exit if significant powers cannot be repatriated from Brussels ahead of an in/out referendum. One Government source said the Prime Minister would risk ‘splitting the party’ unless he suspends the normal convention of collective Cabinet responsibility, to allow ministers to join either the ‘yes’ or ‘no’ campaigns. Scroll down for video . Up to nine Eurosceptic ministers are to demand that David Cameron grants them the freedom to campaign for Britain to leave the EU if the Conservatives remain in power after the general election . Some senior ministers also believe the timetable for the referendum – due by the end of 2017 – is ‘unrealistic’ and will condemn the Tories to more than two years of turmoil if they remain in power after the next election. Details of the divisions came as a former senior Eurocrat accused the Prime Minister of diminishing Britain’s influence in the EU and weakening its relationship with America. Jose Manuel Barroso, the former president of the European Commission, said that under Mr Cameron Britain is no longer at the centre of EU decision-making and has lost its position as an important point of contact between the US and Europe. And he warned that Mr Cameron’s ‘aggressive rhetoric’ against Brussels could lead to a British exit from the EU if a referendum is held. If re-elected, Mr Cameron has pledged to seek to negotiate a looser, more trade-based relationship with Brussels and then ask voters to approve or reject it in a referendum by the end of 2017 – with a ‘no’ vote meaning Britain would leave the EU. Downing Street has already indicated that backbench MPs who want to campaign for Britain to leave the EU, whatever deal the Prime Minister secures, will be free to do so. Chancellor George Osborne said: ‘Ultimately it will be a free vote. It’s a referendum.’ Former senior Eurocrat Jose Manuel Barroso accused the Prime Minister of diminishing Britain’s influence in the EU and weakening its relationship with America . However, Mr Cameron has so far dodged the question of whether ministers will also be free to join whichever side of the argument they support. Mr Barroso, who was succeeded by Jean-Claude Juncker last month, said Mr Cameron had a ‘difficult relationship’ with the EU because of the ‘pressure’ from the Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party. ‘I see David Cameron as basically a very pragmatic leader, someone that certainly wants to defend the interests of his country,’ Mr Barroso told BBC Radio 4’s World At One. ‘But while, with Tony Blair, Britain was really playing a very important role in the European Union, they were at the centre of decisions, today this is no longer the case. ‘The American President, if he wants to get European countries on board, I think the first call he makes is the chancellor of Germany, no longer to the British prime minister.’ Mr Barroso said a British exit from the EU would be a ‘real mistake from all points’ and warned Mr Cameron against continuing to attack Brussels in the run-up to his promised referendum if he wanted the UK to remain part of the union. He said: ‘I think many people that are going to make the case when the time comes, and if there is a referendum, I think the majority will be in favour. ‘But it depends now on leadership in Britain. The current situation – putting the blame on Europe – makes it harder.’ Former Prime Minister Harold Wilson allowed his ministers to vote with their consciences on Europe, something David Cameron is unlikely to do . In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should join the European Community, Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his party was similarly split on the issue. Cabinet ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and also to campaign against each other. Seven Labour cabinet ministers – Tony Benn, Barbara Castle, Michael Foot, William Ross, Peter Shore, John Silkin and Eric Varley – went on to argue unsuccessfully against Britain’s membership. Some of Mr Cameron’s allies argue it would be embarrassing for him to make a similar move if he is recommending voters stay in the EU, since it would undermine his argument that his concessions have made a significant difference. But the Government source insisted: ‘Wilson did just the same as David Cameron: promised to renegotiate and then hold a referendum. ‘He will be very wise to suspend collective responsibility. It is the only way to avoid resignations and ensure once the referendum result is in, everyone comes back together.’ Several Cabinet ministers, including Philip Hammond, Michael Gove and Oliver Letwin, have already suggested publicly they would be likely to vote for an exit on the current terms. Mr Letwin, the Tory policy chief, said he was ‘not sure’ whether the Prime Minister would succeed in persuading other member states to make concessions on issues such as border control. Another Cabinet minister, Sajid Javid, has insisted Britain should have ‘no fear’ of life outside the EU.","Nine ministers are to demand for the freedom to campaign for an EU exit .

"Never taking the people you love for granted could be the key to a happy life according to pensioners wishing to dispense their wisdom to their grandchildren. Three sets of pensioners, including centenarians Maurice and Helen Kaye, have recording a video featuring their advice  for future generations. And the key to being happy it appears is worrying less, following your dreams, not worrying about the future and being thankful for what you have. Scroll down for video . Maurice and Helen Kaye have revealed their happiest moments are when they met and arranged a date . Betty Hal, 95 (left) said one of her happiest memories was going to see her husband in hospital during the war . The video asked the pensioners about their happiest moments and what advice they would give to their grandchildren to safeguard their future well-being. As well as not taking people for granted, Betty, 95, and Doug, 100, Hale, of Winchester, along with William, 84, Maureen, 80, Norman, of Wellingborough also advised people not to hold grudges and to live in the moment rather than worry. The couples listed meeting each other, getting married and having their own children as among their most treasured memories. 1. Never take the people you love for granted . 2. Believe in yourself . 3. Remember what is important to you . 4. Nothing worth having comes easy . 5. Put your heart and soul into everything you do . 6. Don't hold grudges . 7. Don't be jealous of success . 8. Stop worrying and live in the moment . 9. Spend more time with your family . 10. Choose your friends wisely . Mrs Kaye, 101, of Bournemouth, said her happiest moment was when her husband of 80 years walked into her parents' shop for the first time to pick up an order and didn't leave for three hours. She said: 'I think my best memory was when he walked into my mother's shop to get an order and after three hours my mother said who is going to throw him out, you or me, because no customers can get in.' Mr Kaye, 102, said that while that day was not his favourite, as he was chucked out, he was able to arrange a date with his future wife a few weeks later. As couples who lived through the Second World War, the pensioners said that appreciating each other has been central to their happiness. Mrs Hale said: 'One of my happiest memories is when I went up to Manchester to see Doug when he was brought back from the second front in France wounded. 'I walked into the hospital and there he was in hospital blues and he looked at me and there was a great big smile on his face.' Mr and Mrs Kaye are pictured on their wedding day 80 years ago and said they fondly remembered the day . Maureen and William Norman said they were happier now as they appreciated the things they have . The Normans, of Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, are pictured on their wedding day 60 years ago . The video was directed by BAFTA-award winning director Gary Tarn for insurance company Beagle Street. A survey by the company found 1,000 over-70s claimed they were at their most happy around the age of 40. Getting married, having children and grandchildren featured on the top lists of happiest moments. 1. Birth of a first child . 2. Wedding day . 3. Birth of grandchildren . 4. Birth of another child . 5. Day of retirement . 6. Moving into a new home . 7. Seeing your child's first steps . 8. Hearing your child's first words . 9. Meeting the man or woman of your dreams . 10. First kiss with them. And the biggest regrets.... 1. Choosing the wrong career . 2. Not furthering education . 3. Not travelling enough . 4. Getting divorced . 5. Getting married too soon . Mrs Norman said while having her children was one of her happiest memories, she feels most content now. She said: 'I'm more happy now than I've ever been. Our generation have been through World War Two when things were rationed and food was rationed. 'It makes us appreciate the things we have now. I could kiss my automatic washing machine.' The research also revealed that men are happiest at 40, while women hit their positive peak at 38 - citing being fit and healthy, having a great group of friends and feeling confident in their appearance as the main reasons. The findings show loving relationships outweigh money and material gains with life's top ten happiest moments dominated by friends and family. The most common cause for regret was choosing the wrong career and not pursuing lifelong dreams. One in ten of those with regrets wished they had worked harder in school with seven per cent regretting that they had not travelled the world. Matthew Gledhill, managing director of Beagle Street, said: 'The overwhelming message from those with the most life experience is that the key to happiness is to worry less and live in the moment with the people you care about most. : .","Three sets of pensioners have revealed what has made them happiest .

"Public scandals and White House security breeches have revealed a decline in the Secret Service after the agency spent decades  as the gold-standard in law enforcement world. Now, former  agents and former leaders charged with overseeing the agency are hitting back - saying the Secret Service has been the victim of demands protect more people and accomplish more - all while the budget has remained flat or been cut. Some lawmakers aren't buying this excuse and saying the Secret Service has been unaccountable for years and that leaders in the agency don't have the proper oversight. Battered: The Secret Service has come under increasing criticism for security lapses in gaffes in recent years . The Washington Post reports that on September 11, 2001, the Secret Service was charged with protecting  18 people, including President George W. Bush, his immediate family and the vice-president and his immediate family. After the attacks, Bush ordered the agency to begin protecting his extended family, including his four brothers and sister, and Vice President Dick Cheney's adult daughters and his grandchildren. President Barack Obama has largely continued that trend and currently. The Secret Service is in charge of protecting 27 people, including Vice President Joe Biden's school-age granddaughters and Obama's closest adviser, Valerie Jarrett, the Post reports. Each person requires two to six agents to protect them at a time and the agents work in two to three daily shifts for round-the-clock cover. The Secret Service says it needs 1,420 Uniform Division officers to protect the White House, currently, it say only has 1,320, the Post says. Even as the responsibilities have expanded, the staff of the Secret Service has stayed the same. A wave of early retirements from the 1990s to 2002 meant that 925 senior agents left the agency while they were still in their productive years, the Post reports. All this has culminated in shocking shortcomings in protecting the president and the White House. Offices from the uniform branch of the Secret Service, which guards the White House, told the Post they are often called in to work overtime on their days off because of a shortage of staff. Short-handed: The Uniform Division of the Secret Service, which protects the White House, has 100 fewer officers than needed and continually asks agents to work overtime . The agency has also canceled regular training sessions that keep officers current because the Secret Service can't afford to take them away from their jobs. Additionally, because of a shortfall in funds, the agency decided to cancel all but three of its academy training classes - leading to a shortfall of new recruits, according to the Post. The Secret Service is also in charge of catching counterfeiters. Since 9/11, the agency was given the task of tracking online threats against financial institutions - further expanding their portfolio. It has also picked up responsibilities of monitoring large crowds at sports arenas and other events for possible terrorist threats, according to the Post. Another blow to the agency, insiders claim, came when Bush ordered the Secret Service rolled into the new Department of Homeland Security following 9/11. It was formerly part of the Treasury Department, which has deep pockets and treated the Secret Service like a crown jewel, the Post reports. In Homeland Security, former agents say, the Secret Service suddenly had to compete for money with much larger agencies . Secret Service has about 6,200 employees. Other Homeland Security departments like the Transportation Security Administration and the US Customs and Border Protection - which each have about 50,000. All this comes as the budget has mostly stayed flat - or even contracted a little. The 2013 budget was $1.5billion, down from $1.6billion the year before. The agency responded by cutting 300 jobs. 'There was a competition for dollars in an increasingly finite budget environment,' Chris Cummiskey, a former Homeland Security official in the Obama Administration, told the Post. Oscar Gonzalez (left) was arrested after making into the White House with a knife before Secret Service could stop him in September. Dominic Adesanya (right) is another White House fencer jump this year . On September 19, an intruder armed with a knife jumped the White House fence and made it inside the front door president's home before he was finally tackled and arrested. Director Julia Pierson resigned as a result of dramatic lapses from that incident - including Secret Service officers who weren't trained in how to respond to an intruder, radios that didn't work correctly and other stunning lapses in security. Pierson herself took over in the wake of another scandal - the prostitution debacle in Colombia 2012 that saw several agents lose their jobs after they were caught partying hard and buying hookers while on an advance trip to scout security ahead of President Obama's arrival. Despite pleas from current and former Secret Service agents for more money and resources, some in Washington say that the agency has never wanted for anything - and they it must learn to cut unnecessary fat. 'I don’t think the Secret Service has been held accountable for the last 15 years,' Utah Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz told the Post. Tom Ridge, the first Secretary of Homeland, Security said: 'The entire focus of the nation shifted after 9/11, and all federal agencies had to adjust to the new realities. 'That said, the Secret Service, because of its protective mission and direct ties to the White House, never suffered from a lack of resources to carry out their critical responsibilities during my time at DHS.' Earlier this month, a report from Homeland Security blasted the budget management of the Secret Service because agency officials couldn't even give a figure for how much it costs to protect the White House. 'No one has really looked at how much the mission, done right, actually costs,' the report found.","Secret Service protects 27 people now - up from 18 in 2011 .
Budget has been cut from $1.6billion to $1.5billion and staff has been cut by 300 .
Uniform Division, which protects the White House, has 1,320 officers, 100 fewer than needed .
Move from Treasury to Homeland Security means the Secret Service has had to compete with bigger agencies for resources .
Officers protecting the White House forced to work overtime and days off because there are too few staffers available .

"Revealed: A newly released autopsy report on Ezell Ford, 25, revealed he was shot three times by LAPD officers, including once in the back, on August 11 . An autopsy report released Monday shows that an unarmed and mentally ill 25-year-old black man killed in a confrontation with LAPD this summer was shot three times, including in his right side, right arm and his back. The report on the autopsy of Ezell Ford by the Los Angeles County coroner's office had been ordered withheld by police for months to avoid tainting potential witness statements. Ford was unarmed when police confronted him on a street near his home August 11. Police said officers tried to speak to him but ended up in a struggle and shot him when he tried to grab an officer's gun. The autopsy report stated that a muzzle imprint was found around the back wound and coroner's investigators noted abrasions to Ford's left hand, forearm and elbow. Toxicology tests showed Ford had marijuana in his system at the time of his death. Steve Lerman, an attorney for Ford's parents, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Ford's parents have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit and $75 million claim against the city. More protests were planned for Monday afternoon following release of the report. The suit said two gang officers involved in the shooting - Sharlton Wampler and Antonio Villegas - knew Ford from the neighborhood and were aware he had mental problems. The suit also claimed that the city, LAPD and 10 unnamed superiors or other officers were part of a culture that tolerated civil rights violations, including racial profiling and excessive force against blacks. The withholding of the autopsy report became an issue itself, but in November, Mayor Eric Garcetti promised that it would be released before year's end. The report was being withheld so as to enable the corroboration of possible witness statements, he has said. Keeping the peace? LAPD Chief Charlie Beck speaks to the media Monday after the Los Angeles County Coroner released an autopsy report on the LAPD's shooting of Ezell Ford in Los Angeles . The withholding of the autopsy report became an issue itself, but in November, Mayor Eric Garcetti promised that it would be released before year's end.The report was being withheld so as to enable the corroboration of possible witness statements, he has said . Tyler Izen, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said in a statement that the autopsy presented only 'one set of facts among many hundreds being collected and assessed in the ongoing investigation.' 'LAPD officers are put directly in harm's way every day as they face complex situations, unthinkable dangers and split-second decisions while protecting the residents of Los Angeles,' Izen said. 'No officer goes to work with the intent of using force, much less deadly force, but force may become necessary when there is an objectively reasonable certainty that there could be injury to themselves or someone else. As tragic as these situations are, law enforcement officers absolutely have the right to defend their life or the life of another.' Ford's death drew some 500 demonstrators to police headquarters the Sunday after the shooting. It followed the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown by white police officer Darren Wilson. Grand juries decided not to bring charges against that policeman, nor against a white officer in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man in New York City. The LAPD said no officer was hurt in the incident, and Ford, who was identified by family members, died in hospital. Demonstrators rally against the Missouri grand jury's decision to not indict Darren Wilson for his fatal shooting of Michael Brown, in front of a mural of Ezell Ford, on the corner of Broadway and 65th Street in Los Angeles, California December 1. Ford, 25, was killed by police in Los Angeles on August 11, two days after Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by Darren Wilson .

"A man who was shot dead outside a home in Sydney's west on Sunday night was a victim of a conflict between two warring families. In the third shooting incident between the families, Bilal Taha, also known as Bill, was shot just before 6pm outside a residence in Condell Park and  later died in hospital of his bullet wounds. 'The death of this person in a very violent and targeted shooting was as a direct result of a current conflict between two families,' said Detective Superintendent Steve Eardley. Scroll down for video . Bill Taha, 34, was killed outside of a home in Condell Park on Sunday night as part of a feud between families . Mr Taha, 34, was the victim of 'significant criminal activity' between the two warring families. 'We believe this current dispute is a direct result of this criminal activity,' Superintendent Eardley added. He called for a cease of the recurring violence, asking for the heads of the warring families to take responsibility to ensure the bloodshed stopped immediately. 'The patriarchs and the matriarchs of these families need to pull these families in line,' he said. 'Enough is enough. There has been enough bloodshed, there has been enough loss of life.' One neighbour who heard the gunshots and called the police said the incident was terrifying. 'It’s traumatic. He was conscious, then he slipped away. They resuscitated him before they put him in the ambulance. He was bleeding quite a bit. It was horrible,' she said. 'The mum had just had knee surgery and was sitting there watching him,' she told The Daily Telegraph. Mr Taha owned and operated the company City Design and Construction and worked in the building industry .

There was a lot of screaming, a lot of people came out of that house,' she said. Family members and friends took to social media to grieve for Mr Taha. 'I carry your heart with me, I carry it in my heart...... RIP Bill... xoxo,' posted one family member.

Detectives from the State Crime Command’s Homicide Squad are expected to aid in investigations into the shooting . Superintendent Eardley said that the conflict between the families had been going on for around two months but wouldn't comment on reports that the victim's mother saw her son shot. 'The community and the police have had enough of this violence. We cannot tolerate his type of behaviour in our community,' he said. 'This has happened in a quiet suburban street.' Investigators have been told a car drove from the scene shortly after the shooting at about 6.10pm and they want anyone with information about the incident to contact Crime Stoppers. In a separate incident four hours later, several shots were fired at a property in Kibo Road at Regents Park.

"The head honchos of national burrito chain Chipotle have apologized following an incident in which a single Brooklyn location employee raised his arms in a one man-protest against uniformed NYPD customers. The 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture got nine officers in such a tizzy December 16, they turned heel and left the store. Contrary to an internet rumor gone viral, however, they were not refused service at the Brooklyn  eatery. Scroll down for video . A lone worker's act: This Chipotle location in Brooklyn, New York came under fire after an employee raised his hands in a 'don't shoot' protest gesture as nine NYPD cops walked in . 'We work very hard to ensure that every customer in our restaurants feels welcome and is treated with respect,' said co-CEO’s Steve Ells and Monty Moran in a statement Monday. 'Clearly, the actions of this crew member undermined that effort.' It was an almost unavoidable response from the company's top brass after pro-NYPD groups became enraged both with news of the employee's seemingly tasteless act and with the subsequent untrue reports that the Brooklyn store refused to serve the men in blue. The amplifying effect of social media and blogs even led to suggestions the Chipotle company itself is somehow anti-police. Hands up: The employee took it upon himself to raise his hands in the now ubiquitous anti-police brutality gesture, but in an apology released by company co-CEOs, Chipotle said it did not reflect on the chain's beliefs . Pointing toward a decidedly unofficial Facebook page named Thank You NYPD that claimed 'an officer was in fact refused service at Chipotle,' as evidence, Twitter user @ChuckCJohnson posted the Brooklyn store's phone number in apparent attempt to get his 20,000 followers to harass its employees. All of that, of course, because of one employee's self-motivated act. 'We have conducted a review of the incident including interviews with the crew and a review of video footage from security cameras,' read Chipotle's CEO's statement, obtained by the New York Daily News. They continued: 'Our investigation has shown that this appears to have been a spontaneous, unplanned action taken by an individual crew member and was not a coordinated effort by the staff of the restaurant.' As the News points, this incident occurred at the very same store once known to be frequented by area cops because of a 'prohibited and unofficial' 50 percent discount officers were being given. From a 2012 New York Times article: . 'The crowd at lunch and dinner is peppered with officers: some at tables, more in line and some carrying to-go bags. They are drawn by burritos and tacos, the proximity to Brooklyn’s courthouses and an unadvertised special: a 50 percent discount given to officers in uniform. 'Many of the police officers who eat there may not have been aware of the discount, the restaurant’s general manager, Gonzalo Romero, said. Some express surprise when their bill comes to half of the advertised price. “When they see it, they go, ‘Thank you very much,’ ” he said.' Police officers are banned from receiving gratuities for their services. When asked by the Times about the Brooklyn Chipotle's hefty discount, the store's manager referred to it instead as a 'courtesy.'","The burrito chain's chiefs say they're sorry about the incident at the Brooklyn location .

"Utah's abortion rate has dropped to the lowest level ever recorded and restrictive abortion laws are being credited for the change. The rate fell to 4.6 abortions per 1,000 women in 2013, down from a high of 11.1 in 1980 and 7.2 in 1975, when the state began keeping statistics, according to the Utah Department of Health. Utah's abortion rate hovered around 6 from 1997 to 2008 before dropping to 5 in 2011. Utah's abortion rate has dropped to the lowest level ever recorded and restrictive abortion laws are being credited for the change (stock image) The 2,893 Utah women who had abortions in 2013 is also the lowest total since 1977, though the population of women has doubled since then. Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, attributes the decrease to restrictive abortion laws including one in Utah requiring a 72-hour abortion waiting period. She told The Salt Lake Tribune: 'The legislative efforts of the right-to-life movement, and significantly, the resulting national debate and educational campaigns surrounding pro-life legislation should not be minimized when discussing the decline in abortion numbers.' But Karrie Galloway, director of Planned Parenthood of Utah, questioned the claim. She cited the increased use of contraception by women and greater family planning as major factors, saying: 'I don't think they can draw those conclusions any better than I can say (there are fewer abortions because) people have been able to access family planning and have good methods to prevent unintended pregnancy. We are guessing people's hearts and minds.' Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, attributes the decrease to restrictive abortion laws including one in Utah requiring a 72-hour abortion waiting period (stock image) Laurie Baksh of the state health department's Maternal and Infant Health Program said she has no way of knowing what, if any, impact new laws have had on abortion. She thinks the most recent recession caused many women to think about the economic realities of raising a child. Big differences in abortion rates exist in Utah. They range from 100 abortions for every 1,000 babies born in Salt Lake County and 143.5 in Summit County to 22.9 in Utah County. The latter is one of the most Mormon counties while the other two are among the least Mormon in the state, according to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The church opposes abortion except in cases of incest, rape or jeopardy to a mother's life.Utah's rate of abortions has always been well below the national level.","Utah's abortion rate fell to 4.6 terminations per 1,000 women in 2013 .

"Hayley Crews' most cherished Christmas present came two days late. The Oregon woman lost her cat more than a week ago after her boyfriend sold her box spring on Craigslist, without realizing her kitty named Camo was hiding inside. After a massive search involving hundreds of tips, Camo was located this weekend and is finally back home with Crews and her boyfriend Roy Dufek. Christmas miracle! Camo the cat has returned home ten days after he was taken from the apartment hidden inside a box spring that its owner's boyfriend sold on Craigslist . Back home: The Tabby cat was caught using a live trap and when its owners found him, he was two pounds lighter with a squinty eye, bleeding paws and several broken nails . Owners: Roy Dufek (right) was selling a bed via Craigslist on girlfriend Hayley Crews' (left) behalf in preparation for moving in together and didn't realize the feline was hiding inside the frame . The Tabby cat originally went missing on December 17 when Dufek decided to surprise his girlfriend by selling her extra mattresses on Craigslist, ahead of moving in together. What he didn't realize at the time though, was that her cat liked to hide in the box spring. Dufek noticed Camo was missing shortly after seeing the box spring off to its new owner, who took it more than six miles down the road to an area near the Hillsboro Airport outside Portland, Oregon. The couple searched the home of the person who bought the box spring to no avail - Camo wasn't there. Distance: The cat was located near the Hillsboro Airport, which is about six miles from the apartment building where Crews lived with the cat . From there, the couple started a massive canvassing campaign, covering their town in missing cat posters and searching for the feline on foot. Unfortunately, the couple had to leave town shortly after Camo went missing to spend the holidays back home in Arizona. But when they came back on Saturday they got a pleasant surprise. A tipster called Dufek after spotting a cat that looked like Camo near the Hillsboro Airport. On Saturday, the couple set up a live trap which included sardines and clothing from Crews' home. Beloved: The couple received hundreds of calls with possible spottings of Camo during the 10 days the cat was missing . After just an hour and a half, Crews and a friend returned to the trap and found Camo inside - albeit a little worse for wear. In a message on Facebook, Dufek writes that Camo was scared and hissing when they found the cat in the crate. Back home, they noticed Camo was about two pounds lighter and had a cut lip, several broken nails, bleeding paws and a squinty eye. 'He spent the night getting up several times eating and drinking and was taken to the vet this morning,' Dufek wrote. 'The vet gave him an antibiotic shot, a good inspection, and he was off back to home where we think we pulled a tick off and are treating him for fleas. 'Hayley gave him a bath and he's been cleaning himself vigorously since.' The couple go on to thank everyone who volunteered their time to aid in the search for Camo, especially during the holidays. 'It was quite emotional last night, we're in shock of this whole experience, and have been holding him tight!' Dufek wrote.

"A couple who unearthed a time capsule dated 1978 hidden away in their wall have found the man who left in there when he was just 12 years old. Greg Sandoval and his partner were renovating their house in Fontana, California, when they pulled away a wall panel to find a plastic bag hidden there more than 36 years ago. The package contained a note, a few coins, a newspaper cutting and a McDonald's scratch card - and was signed by seventh-grader Robert Wright. Times a-changing: Robert Wright, shown left as a schoolboy, hid a time capsule in the wall of his home in Fontana, California, when he was 12. Now he is aged 49 (right), the capsule has been rediscovered . 'Hello whoever finds this': The 12-year-old Wright explained in the note that his dad's DIY was giving him the chance to hide the note away. He also provided 'proof' of the date . The note read: 'Hello to whoever finds this. My name is Robert Wright. Today my dad is putting up paneling. 'Today is November 18th, 1978, 15 till 12:00 noon. I'm 12 years old and a student at Fontana JR. High, 7th grade. 'I am 5'3, blond hair, hazel eyes. Here is proof of the date. Robert Wright.'

Laid out: Above the items which were removed from the plastic bag can be seen . At first, Sandoval had no idea who Wright really was - and his own searches came to nothing. But after telling his story to local news station ABC7, news the capsule had been found made it across the country to the boy - now grown into a 49-year-old man. Wright, who lives in Austin, Texas, said he was inundated with messages after the local news story - and realized the boy in question must have been his schoolboy self. Home: Pictured above is the house in Fontana, California, which concealed the capsule for 36 years . He told ABC News: 'I watched the video link and was like, ‘Oh my gosh. This is me. I am that Robert Wright.' Recalling the moment he stashed away the package, he said: 'I wrote the note and it wasn’t enough and I needed proof of the date so I tore off a newspaper. 'I don’t have any recollection of the McDonald’s ticket - my guess is I just ran off into my room and grabbed whatever I could find with the date on it and just stuck it in the baggy and threw it in the wall.'","Greg Sandoval found capsule from 36 years ago in his home, signed by child .

"A one-year-old boy was shot dead after a barrage of bullets was fired into a home in an attack police think was either entirely meaningless or a mistake. Bill Thao, who was 13 months old, died Saturday after being hit by a bullet inscribed 'to whom it may concern' - fired by an unknown attacker into his home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The child, who had recently learned to walk, was standing up and playing with toys when a hail of at least 28 bullets was launched around 6.30pm Saturday. Shot dead: Bill Thao, who was 13 months old, died after being hit by a bullet fired into a home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he was visiting . Dozens of shots: These bullet holes in the home's windows were marked by police investigating the killing. At least 28 shots were marked on the two-storey building. The bullet which killed Bill was inscribed 'to whom it may concern' Bill was wounded, but still conscious, when he was taken to hospital, but later died. According to Fox6 News, the boy and his mother did not live at the home, but were visiting along with several other children. Detectives believe more than one gun was used in the attack. They have not arrested anybody in connection with it, or described any suspects, but say they are working on several leads. Kou Thao, Bill's cousin, said Bill had only arrived at the home 15 minutes before he was shot dead. Meaningless attack? Police say they have no motive for the attack as yet. Nobody has been arrested or named as a suspect . He told Fox: 'He was standing - playing with toys on a table. We got some veterans from the Vietnam War. 'When they heard the shots they just grabbed all the kids and put them down — so that really helped.' An uncle, Be Thao, said: 'I feel sad. I feel really sad. We just gather together and cry for the innocent child.' At a news conference held near the home, Milwaukee officials said the people inside the home appear to have had nothing whatsoever to do with the attack. Outraged: Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett said the family could never deserve the situation they find themselves in, and had nothing to do with the gun attack . More bullets: Police are analyzing several guns for clues in the shooting, which is yet to yield any suspects . City mayor Tom Barrett said: 'I don't know if the shooters were stupid, on drugs... 'I don't know if they had the wrong house - but as far as we can tell, the people in this home had nothing to do with those shots being fired.'

"A series of incredible photographs shows an extremely rare white mother bear teaching her adorable little cub how to catch a fish. The spectacular white bear decides it's time her little one knew how to catch dinner and leads it to a nearby river. At just eight months old, the cute albino cub timidly follows its mummy-bear around the rocky edges of the river to learn from the best. The rare white bear decides it's time her little one knew how to catch dinner and leads it to a nearby river . The adorable little white bear cub appeared to be around eight months old and still learning to fish . Although the 7st baby bear goes home empty handed, its expert mother takes home a large salmon for their dinner. The delightful pictures were taken by Kyle Breckenridge in the Great Bear Rainforest, British Columbia, Canada. The bears are so rare it is believed this is only the third time a white mother bear and her cub have been sighted together. Mr Breckenridge, 43, traveled to the huge rainforest on the West coast of Canada from his home in Calgary, Canada. The adult mother bear catches a large salmon to take home for her and her little cub's dinner . The white bears, which are also known as 'Kermode' or 'Spirit' bears are thought to have a population of less than 1,000 and are a subspecies of the black bear. Mr Breckenridge, who works as an accountant, had to travel an hour and a half by paddle boat on the river to see the white bears. He said: 'It was very peaceful and spiritual experience. This was my third trip into this area of the Great Bear Rainforest and my first white bear sighting.

'The Great Bear Rainforest always leaves you with a smile, however, this time it was bigger than ever. 'It was amazing to be there as it happened, the mother bear took the lead and done fishing whilst the cub observed and learnt from her. 'The cub would stick close to the mother and would get excited when she caught a fish, both would disappear into the forest to eat for several hours afterwards. The incredible series of photographs was taken at the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, Canada . Kyle Breckenridge, 43, who took the photographs traveled an hour and a half by paddle boat on the river to see the white bears . 'I couldn't believe my eyes, the mother bear was like a professional at catching fish and the little baby bear watched in amazement. 'Both the mother and cub were very cautious and I made sure I took extra care so I didn't spook them. 'They would even make noises to test the area around them, they do this to find out if there is any danger about. 'It was amazing to watch the bears behave naturally. 'The salmon carcass that she caught will provide vital nutrients that are important to both of the bears. 'The mum will teach the cub how to find food sources for each of the seasons. This cub will become independent of its mother at 16 to 18 months.' Kyle said both the mother and cub were very cautious so he had to be extremely careful not to spook the pair .

"A businessman is believed to have fatally stabbed his wife and left his daughter fighting for her life before knifing himself to death - just months after he was released from a mental hospital. Michael Greaney, 53, who had a history of 'serious' mental issues, stabbed his daughter Michelle, 21, in the chest before killing his wife Valerie, 49, at their home in Cork, reports suggest. The physical therapist was admitted to the Central Mental Hospital in 2013 after being found guilty of assaulting and falsely imprisoning a woman and a barring order was put in place. But the order was removed at the request of the family after his wife pleaded on his behalf saying he had been under tremendous financial and psychological pressure at the time. Scroll down for video . Police believe Michael Greaney, 53, (far left) stabbed his wife Valerie, 29, (left) to death after attacking his 21-year-old daughter Michelle (right) The couple's 16-year-old daughter raised the alarm at 3.30pm yesterday after coming across the suspected murder-suicide. Her sister, 21-year-old Michelle, was stabbed in the chest, but managed to get outside the house despite her injuries and was found collapsed on the street by neighbours. She was rushed to Cork University Hospital for emergency surgery to injuries initially said to be life-threatening. Her condition was later described as critical but stable. It is understood her mother Valerie was found in the hallway of the home with a stab wound to her chest and died shortly after being discovered. Mr Greaney, who also worked as the gardener in the Bishop of Cloyne's palace, was found in an upstairs bedroom with wounds believed to have been self-inflicted. His other daughter Sarah was not physically harmed and was able to run from the house in Cobh to raise the alarm, but she has been left severely traumatised by what she witnessed. Mr Greaney had a history of mental issues and was admitted to the Central Mental Hospital in 2013 following an attack on a family member while Michelle had recently graduated . When he appeared in court in 2013, Mr Greaney spoke of his remorse over the attack in which he attempted to smother the woman by stuffing a rag into her mouth, according to the Herald. Seconds after the attack, in which the woman managed to struggle free, he attempted to slash his artery using a Stanley knife. Family friend, Darragh McGann, who attended the scene to offer what support he could, said the entire community was heartbroken by the tragedy. 'The sympathies and prayers of the entire Cobh community goes out to the Greaney family at this terrible time. It is just so, so sad,' he said. A security source told the Irish Mirror: 'The father had a serious mental health issue. It's not a case at all that he lost his temper and lashed out violently. 'That's something that is being stressed by those who knew him. There was an incident two years ago and he ended up in the Central Mental Hospital. 'The Greaneys are a very well respected and popular family in Cobh. An incident like this, especially at Christmas, will shock the community.' The family had suffered a tragedy four weeks previously when Mrs Greaney's mother passed away. One neighbour said: 'Valerie's mother is there, God rest her, and now her daughter will be joining her. This is a terrible tragedy.' Another said: 'How could any man do such a thing? That poor woman only buried her mother last month and now she is gone, too and God knows if her girl will survive. 'It is unbelievable for such a thing to happen, particularly at this time of year.' Forensics sealed off the Greaneys' house in Cork, Ireland, and the bodies of the couple were taken to Cork University Hospital where postmortems will be carried out today . Mr Greaney was a well-known physical therapist in Cobh, where he worked alongside his wife. In his youth he was a keen rower and won three All-Ireland medals competing in coastal races. He served as a Minister of the Eucharist in St Colman's Cathedral and was seen distributing Holy Communion to parishioners, including his wife, at Mass on Christmas Day. The 53-year-old  owned a landscaping business and a number of properties near the Cathedral in the town centre. It is believed he had been suffering from severe financial pressures and some of his properties had been taken into receivership the week before Christmas. The Greaneys' house and the surrounding area was sealed off as forensic officers worked at the scene. The bodies of the couple were taken from their home and assistant state pathologist Dr Margot Bolster began her postmortems on the bodies at the morgue in Cork University Hospital at 10am. Michelle Greaney had been on holiday in August this year and is now said to be in a critical condition . Detectives are waiting for medical clearance to interview Michelle in the hope that she will be able to tell them exactly what happened inside the house. Garda Supt John Quilter, who is heading up the investigation described the deaths as 'a family tragedy' and said police were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. The end-of-terrace property is situated close to the town centre in a modest but well-kept row of houses beside the town's main cemetery. The Greaneys' house still has a string of Christmas lights and reindeer outside. Local councillor Kieran McCarthy last night said that news of the tragedy has left the town distraught. 'It's shocking, that's the best way to describe it,' the Sinn Féin councillor said. 'I don't know how people are going to deal with it. 'They are just trying to take it in for the time being.' Bishop of Cloyne William Crean said he was deeply shocked at the news. 'I ask the faithful of the diocese to pray for all of those affected by these sad events,' he said. The 21-year-old recently graduated from University College Cork and had been working for an online babywear retailer . Detectives are waiting for medical clearance to interview Michelle in the hope that she will be able to tell them exactly what happened inside the house . 'May the light of Christ, whose coming into the world we celebrate at Christmas, help to guide us through this great darkness which has fallen on the community of Cobh, and on the diocese as a whole.' Michelle Greaney recently graduated from University College Cork and had been working for an online babywear retailer. A picture posted online shows her in her graduation gown, flanked by her parents, her younger sister and her boyfriend. Mr Greaney set up his business, Greaney Physical Therapy, with his wife more than a decade ago. The clinic website states that they specialise in the areas of sports and occupational injuries, hypnotherapy and reflexology. It also highlights Mr Greaney's background in rowing at a 'national level' and his 'deep involvement in coaching football and running teams'. Neighbours gathered in shock yesterday around the family home yesterday as the community in Cobh was united in grief. Detectives have appealed for witnesses to contact Cobh Garda station on 021 490 8530, the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111 or any other Garda station.

"The Obama administration is on the verge of proposing long-awaited rules for commercial drone operations in U.S. skies, but key decisions on how much access to grant drones are likely to come from Congress next year. Federal Aviation Administration officials have said they want to release proposed rules before the end of this month, but other government and industry officials say they are likely to be delayed until January. Meanwhile, except for a small number of companies that have received FAA exemptions, a ban on commercial drone flights remains in place. Even after rules are proposed, it is likely to be two or three years before regulations become final. That's too long to wait, say drone industry officials. Every year the ban remains in place, the United States loses more than $10 billion in potential economic benefits that drones could provide, according to the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a trade group. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . IN THE BALANCE: Amazon wants authority to use drones to deliver packages in the US; similar plans in Germany have brought howls from labor unions but little government opposition . NOT AFFECTED: Local law enforcement and other government agencies can use drones for search and rescue, crime-fighting and fugitive hunts -- all without explicit case-by-case permission from Uncle Sam . 'We need some sort of process that allows some of the low-risk operations,' said Jesse Kallman, the head of regulatory affairs for Airware, a drone technology company backed by Google Ventures. 'I think Congress understands that, and hopefully they'll take steps in the coming year to address that.' That appears to be what some key lawmakers have in mind. 'We in Congress are very interested in UAS,' Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said at a hearing this month, referring to unmanned aerial systems, or drones. 'We understand UAS are an exciting technology with the potential to transform parts of our economy. ... It is our responsibility to take a close look.' One of the committee's first priorities next year is writing legislation to reauthorize FAA programs and overhaul aviation policy. The bill is expected to include directions from lawmakers on how to integrate drones into the nation's aviation system. The last reauthorization bill, passed in 2012, directed the agency to integrate drones by Sept. 30, 2015, but it's clear the FAA will miss that deadline. The FAA is expected to propose restricting drones weighing less than 55 pounds to altitudes below 400 feet, forbid nighttime flights and require drones be kept within sight of their operators. Drone operators may also be required to get pilot's licenses, a possibility already drawing fire from critics who say the skills needed to fly a manned aircraft are different from those needed to operate a drone. Shuster indicated he's concerned that requiring pilot's licenses might be burdensome and unnecessary. And keeping drones within sight of operators would be too strict and limit their usefulness, he said. The reason for keeping drones within line of sight is that they don't yet have the ability to detect and avoid other aircraft. AUVSI, the drone industry trade group, recently hired Mark Aitken, former legislative director to New Jersey Republican Rep. Frank LoBiondo as its government relations manager. LoBiondo is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Aviation, which will write the FAA reauthorization bill. DECIDERS: House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Rep. Bill Shuster, a Pennsylvania Republican (left) will lead congressional efforts to clarify what's permitted and what's not . OPEN SEASON: Vehicles like this rescue drone flown by the Box Elder County, Utah Sheriff's Office, are available on the open market and could soon be legal for companies to send into the sky for a variety of tasks . Some drones available over-the-counter in the UK sell for as little as $44 and they flew off shelves this month as Christmas approachedAs cheap as £28, they're Christmas must-haves -- but in October one had a near-miss with a plane near London's Heathrow Airport . 'We're really looking at an incremental approach still,' Aitken said. 'It's not something that is going to happen overnight.' FAA officials have been working on drone regulations for nearly a decade. The agency twice drafted regulations that were later rejected by the White House or Transportation Department. The FAA has long maintained that unmanned aircraft must meet the same regulations as manned aircraft unless waiving or adjusting those regulations doesn't create a safety risk. However, FAA officials more recently have begun talking about 'risk-based' regulations, giving industry officials hope the agency might propose a blanket exemption from regulations for the smallest drones – usually defined as weighing under 5 pounds – as long as operators follow a few basic safety rules. Canadian authorities recently approved a blanket exemption for very small drones. Congress already is getting pushback from private and commercial pilots who worry about possible collisions. The FAA receives reports nearly every day about drones sighted flying near manned aircraft or airports. 'As a (Boeing) 737 captain, I'll be damned if myself and 178 other people are taken down by a 12-pound or a 50-pound or a 150-pound piece of metal coming through my windshield,' said Ben Berman at a recent forum hosted by the Air Line Pilots Association. 'There are too many near misses occurring every day like this.' MENACE: Commercial pilots are alarmed at a series of near-misses near London in which drones came perilously close to airliners . REALLY? A drone engineer built a flying Christmas tree in San Diego this year using a 1.5 HP motor . Mark Baker, president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, which represents private pilots, said online videos show that 'operators are flying near airports, in the clouds and in congested airspace.' He called such actions 'reckless' and said they will inevitably lead to a collision. FAA regulations permit recreational users to fly small drones as long as they stay at least 5 miles away from an airport, limit flights to less than 400 feet in altitude, keep the aircraft in line of sight and fly only during the daytime. Last week, drone industry trade groups teamed up with the FAA and model aircraft hobbyists to launch a safety campaign aimed at amateur drone operations. The campaign includes a website where operators can find FAA regulations and advice on how to fly safely. The trade groups said they also plan to distribute safety pamphlets at industry events and are working with manufacturers to see that safety information is enclosed inside the package of new drones. Retailers say small drones, which are indistinguishable from today's more sophisticated model aircraft, were popular gifts this Christmas.","Obama administration prepares to issue drone rules for commercial companies like Amazon and Google .

"Australia's civil aviation authority is looking to introduce 'world-first' rules surrounding the use of drones after an increase in them being flown 'inappropriately'. The rules currently in place were introduced in 2002 and do not reflect the changes in technology, Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson told Daily Mail Australia. Drones must be kept more than 30 metres away from other people and must not be flown over public places where a large number of people are gathered such as the beach or sporting events. Scroll down for video . Drones can come with GPS systems and cameras. The one pictured is a quadcopter . The devices - which can come with GPS systems and cameras - can only be operated during the day and within line of sight. They should also be kept more than five kilometres away from airports and must not be flown above 400 feet. If these regulations as well as others are violated, infringement notices may be issued or prosecution may be sought where people have been injured. Mr Gibson said 12 years ago recreational use of drones simply did not exist and it was time the authority addressed this growth. 'There are 180 commercial operators and probably tens of thousands of recreational drones out there,' he said. 'We need to update them and bring them up-to-date with usages.' Australia was the first country to introduce rules around drones and regulations coming in next year would be a 'world-first' Mr Gibson said an increase in incidents involving drones had also sparked the authority to update their policies. 'We are getting regular incidents happening where drones are being used inappropriately,' he said. 'Near Christmas there was a police operation in Melbourne and someone flew a drone which hit a power line and it almost fell on a police officer. We need to take [incidents like] that into account as well.' Mr Gibson was unable to comment on specific changes but he said they would be practical and enable recreational users the ability to still have fun. 'It's early days and we're in the process of developing proposals and we’re going to do public consultation,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'But the key to it would be making the rules as practical as possible for your average recreational drone owner, while obviously trying to get the right safety outcomes. 'We're not trying to stop people flying around their drones in the park or the beach or in the paddock. 'They are great fun to fly and relatively speedy. We're trying to get right set of rules to protect aircraft in the air and those on the ground.' The introduction of these rules in Australia would set a precedent for the rest of the world. 'The United States don't have any rules... so we are very much ahead of the game here,' Mr Gibson said. 'We were the first country in the world to have rules around drones.'","The current rules for unmanned aerial vehicles were introduced in 2002 .

"The daughter of the missing AirAsia captain today made an emotional plea for her father to come home, telling him: 'I still need you'. Captain Iriyanto disappeared in airspace thick with storm clouds between Indonesia and Singapore while piloting Flight 8501 with 162 people on board yesterday. His picture was posted on social media by his 22-year-old daughter Angela Ranastianis with the heartbreaking message: 'Papa, please come home, I still need you. Bring back my papa.' Cpt Iriyanto's father said the last time he saw his son was at the funeral of his other son who died of diabetes last week. 'Papa, come home, I still need you': Angela Ranastianis, the daughter of missing AirAsia pilot Iriyanto, has made an emotional appeal for her father to return safely after posting this picture with him online . Double tragedy: Cpt Iriyanto's father, Suwarto (above) said the last time he saw his son was at the funeral of his other son who died of diabetes last week . Suwarto, who has only one name, told the BBC he hoped he would see his son again, but accepted it would be God's will if he didn't. At Iryanto's house in the East Java town of Sidoarjo, neighbours, relatives and friends gathered to pray and recite the Quran to support the distraught family. Their desperate cries were so loud, they could sometimes be heard outside where three LCD televisions had been set up to monitor search developments. 'He is a good man. That's why people here appointed him as our neighbourhood chief for the last two years,' said Bagianto Djoyonegoro, a friend and neighbour, adding that despite being busy with his job, Iryanto was always very active in the community and attentive to the needs of the people around him. Cpt Iriyanto's nephew told Indonesian news outlet Detik.com his uncle, who is married with two young children, was 'a very caring person'. He said: 'He is always helping people because he is a very caring person. If there is a sick relative who needed help and even money, my uncle would be there. 'If there are money problems in the family, he would surely help.' Many recalled him as an experienced Air Force pilot who flew F-16 fighter jets before becoming a commercial airline pilot. AirAsia said the captain had more than 20,000 flying hours, of which 6,100 were with AirAisa on the Airbus 320. Captain Iriyanto disappeared  in airspace thick with storm clouds between  Indonesia and Singapore while piloting Flight 8501 with 162 people on board yesterday. Picture, right, is his daughter Angela Ranastianis . The last communication from the cockpit to air traffic control was a request by one of the pilots to increase altitude from 32,000 feet (9,754 meters) to 38,000 feet (11,582 meters) because of the rough weather. Air traffic control was not able to immediately grant the request because another plane was in airspace at 34,000 feet, said Bambang Tjahjono, director of the state-owned company in charge of air-traffic control. By the time clearance could be given, Flight 8501 had disappeared, Tjahjono said. The twin-engine, single-aisle plane, which never sent a distress signal, was last seen on radar four minutes after the last communication from the cockpit. Earlier today, an Indonesian official said objects have been spotted in the sea by a search plane hunting for a missing AirAsia jet. Jakarta's Air Force base commander Rear Marshal Dwi Putranto said he had been informed that an Australian Orion aircraft had detected suspicious objects near Nangka island, about 100 miles (160km) south-west of Pangkalan Bun, near central Kalimantan, or 700 miles (1,120km) from the location where the plane lost contact. 'However, we cannot be sure whether it is part of the missing AirAsia plane,' he said. 'We are now moving in that direction, which is in cloudy conditions.' Distraught family members of passengers from the missing AirAsia flight try desperately to comfort each other at the crisis centre of Juanda International Airport in Surabaya, Indonesia . Relatives of missing Air Asia QZ8501 passengers cry at Juanda International Airport in Indonesia as they wait for any news about their loved ones . AirAsia Flight 8501 carrying 162 people disappeared yesterday in airspace thick with storm clouds on its way from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore. First Admiral Sigit Setiayana, the Naval Aviation Centre commander at Surabaya air force base, said 12 navy ships, five planes, three helicopters and a number of warships were taking part in the search, along with ships and planes from Singapore and Malaysia. He said visibility was good: 'God willing, we can find it soon.' A rescue official said today that, given the route of the plane, he believed the most likely scenario was that it crashed. 'Based on the co-ordinates that we know, the evaluation would be that any estimated crash position is in the sea, and that the hypothesis is the plane is at the bottom of the sea,' National Search and Rescue chief Henry Bambang Soelistyo told a news conference. The plane's disappearance and suspected crash caps an astonishingly tragic year for air travel in south-east Asia. The Malaysia-based carrier's loss comes on top of the still-unexplained disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July over Ukraine. The last communication between QZ8501's pilot and air traffic control was when he requested to increase his altitude to 34,000 feet due to bad weather . A weather map at the time the plane went missing shows 'vigorous thunderstorms' along the flightpath . At the Surabaya airport, passengers' relatives pored over the plane's manifest, crying and embracing. Nias Adityas, a housewife from Surabaya, was overcome with grief when she found the name of her husband, Nanang Priowidodo, on the list. The 43-year-old tour agent had been taking a family of four on a trip to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia's Lombok island, and had been happy to get the work. 'He just told me, 'Praise God, this new year brings a lot of good fortune,'' she recalled, holding her grandson tight while weeping uncontrollably. Nearly all the passengers and crew are Indonesians, who are frequent visitors to Singapore, particularly on holidays. The Airbus A320 took off yesterday morning from Indonesia's second-largest city and was about halfway to Singapore when it vanished from radar. The jet had been airborne for about 42 minutes. An AirAsia flight - which was an Airbus A320-200 with the registration number PK-AXC (pictured above) - that departed Surabaya early Sunday morning was meant to land at Changi Airport . There was no distress signal from the twin-engine, single-aisle plane, said Djoko Murjatmodjo, Indonesia's acting director general of transportation. The last communication between the cockpit and air traffic control was at 6.13am local time (2313 GMT Saturday), when one of the pilots asked to increase altitude from 32,000ft (9,754m) to 38,000ft (11,582m), Mr Murjatmodjo said. The jet was last seen on radar at 6.16am local time, and was gone a minute later, he told reporters. Malaysia-based AirAsia has a good safety record and had never lost a plane. But Malaysia itself has already endured a catastrophic year, with 239 people still missing from Flight 370 and all 298 people aboard Flight 17 killed when it was shot down over rebel-held territory in Ukraine. AirAsia said Flight 8501 was on its submitted flight plan but had requested a change due to weather. Sunardi, a forecaster at Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency, said dense storm clouds were detected up to 44,000ft in the area at the time. 'There could have been turbulence, lightning and vertical as well as horizontal strong winds within such clouds,' said Sunardi, who like many Indonesians uses only one name.","Captain Iriyanto disappeared in storm clouds while piloting Flight 8501 .

"The architects behind the stunning Tower of London poppies installation claimed last night they would be snubbed by Turner Prize judges for not being part of the art elite. Artist Paul Cummins and designer Tom Piper - who worked on the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red project - said they would be shunned for being a ‘Derby-based artist’ and ‘theatre designer’. Mr Cummins also hit out at comments made by former Turner Prize judge Jonathan Jones that the memorial was ‘toothless’ - and the moat of the Tower ‘should be filled with barbed wire and bones’. Scroll down for video . Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red: Each of the 888,246 poppies, which filled the moat of the Tower for Remembrance Day, represented a British or Commonwealth casualty of the First World War . Not in the art elite: Artist Paul Cummins (above) said he would be shunned for being a 'Derby-based artist' Mr Cummins, 37, who lost a finger making one of the poppies, told the Guardian that a Turner nomination was ‘not going to happen’, but probably would have done ‘if it had been anyone else’. And he said of the controversial article by Mr Jones, printed in the same newspaper in October: ‘It was a massive shame that certain people had to force their own opinions on other people. ‘It would have ended up looking like The Rocky Horror Show if we’d have done what he wanted.’ And Mr Piper told the newspaper: ‘It has spoken to something very personal in people and allowed them to engage in their emotions. ‘And the people who couldn’t see that, I just feel they didn’t open themselves up to what it was all about. They felt they had to make some intellectual comment about it, when actually it was so simple and beautiful.’ Popular: Nearly five million people flocked to view the stunning exhibit in the run-up to Remembrance Sunday . Poignant: General Sir Richard Dannatt, former head of the British Army, reads names of the fallen before the placing of the last ceramic poppy in the moat of Tower of London to mark Armistice Day, on November 11 . The article by Mr Jones - published two months ago here - was also criticised by Daily Mail columnist Robert Hardman, who asked in an article: 'Why DO the Left despise patriotism?' It was reported last month that Mr Cummins and Mr Piper were in line for gongs in the Queen's New Year’s honours list, with the pair most likely to be appointed OBEs for services to the arts. Nearly five million people flocked to view the installation ahead of Remembrance Sunday. Mr Cummins said the project was inspired by an unknown soldier from his home town. Mr Piper, a theatrical designer with the Royal Shakespeare Company, helped devise the exhibit and was instrumental in creating two of its key elements. These were the Weeping Willow - a cascade of poppies which spills from a window of the castle - and the Wave - which swirls out of the moat to form an arch over the entrance to the Tower. The team began producing the flowers - each of which took three days to make - at an 8,000ft factory in Derby in January. Beautiful: Mr Cummins hit out at comments made by a former Turner judge that the memorial was 'toothless' Royal attendance: The artwork, marking the centenary of the outbreak of war in 1914, captured the public imagination and was visited by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh (pictured) Each of the 888,246 poppies, which filled the moat of the Tower for Remembrance Day, represented a British or Commonwealth casualty of the First World War. The artwork, marking the centenary of the outbreak of war in 1914, captured the public imagination and was visited by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, as well as Princes William and Harry. The poppies were removed last month and are mostly being sent out to people who have bought them for £25 each. Previously, Mr Cummins has said: ‘I read through wills of First World War soldiers and came across one man who said everyone he knew had been killed. He wrote of “blood swept lands and seas of red, where angels dare to tread”. It read like a poem and it just seemed to fit.’ The artist, who is studying for a PhD at Derby University, added: ‘This is the biggest thing I have done. I am amazed that people have taken it to heart.’ The Turner Prize is a contemporary art award given annually to ‘a British artist under 50 for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work in the 12 months preceding’.","Paul Cummins and Tom Piper worked on installation in central London .

He was rushed to hospital with a critical brain injury, but died on Saturday . On Thursday, the baby's parents were arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault. It is unclear what charges they may face now their son has succumbed to his injuries. 'We’re just waiting for the county attorney’s office to see what the actual charges will be, since the baby died,' Billings Police Department Lieutenant Jeremy House told the Billings Gazette. Paramedics were first alerted to the child's fate at around 8pm on Thursday after Kayla Edwards called 911 and reported that her son had stopped breathing, KRTV reported. They raced to the house on the 200 block of Terry Avenue, where they discovered the baby in a critical condition. They alerted police after spotting a number of 'suspicious' injuries on his body. Scene: On Thursday, the baby's parents were arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault. It is unclear what charges they may face now their son has passed away. Above, the scene of the 'attack' in Terry Avenue . 'Medical personnel observed suspicious injuries on the infant and notified the Billings Police Department,' Lt House wrote in a press release on Friday. During a subsequent police investigation, Kayla Edwards was found to have 'struck her son in the head so hard that she caused a brain injury', an affidavit of probable cause stated. 'The defendant then strangled her son to prevent him from breathing,' it added. Tragic: The child was transferred to to Children's Hospital Colorado (pictured) in Aurora, where he later died . In an interview with police, Brandon Edwards allegedly admitted to watching and allowing his wife to assault their newborn son, as well as confessing to choking the child on another occasion. The baby, who died at 3.48am on Saturday, is believed to have a twin sister. His parents remain in custody at Yellowstone County Jail. They are expected to appear in court on Monday. Police are investigating.","Kayla and Brandon Edwards allegedly beat and strangled baby son .

"Ministers faced fresh accusations of a cover-up last night after refusing to reveal crucial details of British meetings with US politicians investigating CIA torture. Home Secretary Theresa May was one of several British politicians and envoys who paid 24 visits to senior members of the Senate Intelligence Committee as it investigated barbaric techniques used on terror suspects. The disclosure has fuelled claims that the Government desperately lobbied to keep allegations of Britain’s complicity in torture out of the committee’s damning report. Ministers faced fresh accusations of a cover-up last night after refusing to reveal crucial details of British meetings with US politicians investigating CIA torture . In the end, there was not a single mention of Britain’s security and intelligence services when the dossier was published this month, highlighting horrific mistreatment of detainees by the CIA including beatings, waterboarding and rectal feeding. No 10 has admitted that MI5 and MI6 held negotiations with the committee about blacking out any passages that might compromise ‘national security’. But Mrs May insisted she hadn’t discussed redacting details about Britain when she visited committee chairman Dianne Feinstein for talks in September this year, claiming they discussed other issues. The Foreign Office has refused to reveal the topics on the agenda at meetings attended by Sir Peter Westmacott, Britain’s ambassador to the US, between June 2012 and July 2014 – when the explosive document was being compiled. Documents seen by the Mail, obtained under freedom of information laws, show the department has refused requests for ‘agendas, minutes and other notes relating to or recording the issues discussed’. Home Secretary Theresa May was one of several British politicians and envoys who visited senior members of the Senate Intelligence Committee as it investigated torture . Officials claimed they could not release the information because it would harm ‘international relations, conduct of public affairs, legal professional privilege and commercial interests’. Curiously, it does not cite national security. The decision provoked fury last night among campaigners for the truth about Britain’s alleged complicity in torture by US agents. Donald Campbell, from the human rights charity Reprieve, said: ‘It is bad enough that the Government has U-turned on its promise to hold an independent, judge-led inquiry into British involvement in torture. ‘But worse still, there is mounting evidence that they lobbied the Americans to keep information about UK complicity in torture secret. The sheer number of meetings between the British ambassador and the Senate committee which was examining CIA torture smacks of a cover-up. ‘We need to know what happened in those meetings: Was the committee pressured to remove or redact information about British involvement from the report? The Government must stop dragging its feet and release this evidence now.’ The Mail told this week of the existence of a list detailing how ministers and diplomats met committee members 24 times in six years – equivalent to once every three months. The access prompted questions about the influence successive British governments tried to exert to ensure the country was not tainted by torture revelations. The report did not mention Diego Garcia, a British territory in the Indian Ocean leased to the US military, which ministers have admitted was used as a stop-over for extraordinary rendition flights in which suspects were moved to secret prisons to be tortured. The freedom of information request was made in August but the Foreign Office has failed to give a final answer, instead responding with a series of ‘holding’ replies saying it is still making up its mind. A spokesman said a decision on whether to release the information was in the public interest would be made in the New Year. The CIA report did not mention Diego Garcia, a British territory in the Indian Ocean leased to the US military .","Ministers refuse to reveal details of meetings with US torture investigators .

"Dustin Diamond, the actor who played Screech in the 1990s television show Saved By The Bell, appeared in a Wisconsin courtroom on Monday after posting bail on charges that he stabbed a man during a bar fight on Christmas. Diamond, who spent the weekend in jail, posted $10,000 bail before his hearing in Ozaukee County Circuit Court. A criminal complaint charged that Diamond with second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon. Defense attorney Thomas Alberti requested reduced bail and a jury trial for Diamond, 37, who was wearing street clothes and did not speak in court. Scroll down for videos . Dustin Diamond, who played Screech in Nineties TV show Saved By The Bell, waits for his status hearing at Ozaukee County Courthouse on Monday in Port Washington, Wisconsin . Diamond appeared in court with his fiancée on Monday just days after he was jailed for a knife attack at a bar . 'Dustin has complete faith in the justice system,' Alberti said outside the courtroom. He added that Diamond was 'not happy he missed the Packers game' while in jail. But Alberti said Diamond 'made the best of his time here. He got caught up on some books'. The complaint said Diamond and his fiancee 27-year-old fiancée, Amanda Schutz, got into a tussle with two men and a woman at the Grand Avenue Saloon in Port Washington, where Diamond lives, on Thursday night. Diamond told police he accidentally stabbed one of the men while trying to defend his fiancee. The man was not seriously injured. Police say officers recovered a switchblade. Diamond's next court hearing is scheduled for January 5. Diamond and his fiancée head into court for the hearing on Monday afternoon shortly after he was released from prison in Wisconsin . The nineties star, best known for playing nerdy Samuel 'Screech' Powers for thirteen years, was taken into custody after getting into a dispute with another couple at the Grand Avenue Saloon on December 25. FOX6 Now obtained the arrest report stating that Dustin did indeed injure the stabbing victim, identified as Casey. 'I moved his arm up and around, and I had the knife in my hand,' the former child actor told police officers during an interview shortly after the incident. Dustin got involved in the fight after hearing Miss Schutz screaming due to 'two men holding her by the hair'. After talking to officials about what happened, the couple drove away from the bar but were soon pulled over by police. Upon the discovery of the knife, police showed Dustin a witness' video taken inside the bar. The actor admitted he had a knife, telling police he had received a new blade that day and owns several knives.

"When women first started coming forward to accuse Bill Cosby of rape last month, the public was surprised due to his flawless reputation as 'America's dad'. It has now been revealed that a team of lawyers and publicists worked tirelessly to keep his image pristine for decades, by silencing alleged victims and keeping the media from reporting their claims, the New York Times reports. That apparently all-male team includes $850-an-hour Hollywood lawyer Martin Singer (whose clients include Charlie Sheen and Arnold Schwarzenegger), former William Morris agent Norman Brokaw, his publicist son David, and New York lawyer John P Schmitt. Scroll down for video . Reputation tarnished: In recent weeks, Bill Cosby has faced an onslaught of accusations from women who claim to have been raped or sexually assaulted by him. A new report reveals how his legal and media teams have protected his reputation for decades . Protectors: High-profile Hollywood attorney Martin Singer (left),former William Morris agent Norman Brokaw (center), and New York lawyer John P Schmitt (right) are three representatives of Cosby's who have helped silence the rape accusations over the years . Most of the allegations against Cosby date back to the 1970s, which led to speculation over why the women stayed silent for so long. Like many rape victims, some of the women said they never reported the assault because they were scared of Cosby’s power and feared damaging their reputation. The reaction of Cosby’s legal team to the women brave enough to come forward over the years proves that those who stayed silent had good cause for concern. Those who have reported their rapes, either to police or in the media, have had their claims called ‘meritless’ by Cosby’s legal team, who depict them as greedy women seeking to destroy the once-beloved comedian’s reputation for a cut of his fortune. This pattern of intimidation goes all the way back to 2000 when an actress on his TV series ‘Cosby’ allegedly told police that he tried to put her hand down his sweatpants during a visit to his New York townhouse. Cosby’s lawyers threatened to sue the National Enquirer with a $250million defamation lawsuit if they published comments from the alleged victim’s relatives. But his legal team also works with the media to damage Cosby’s alleged victims and discredit their stories. Just five years after threatening to sue the Enquirer, the paper was once again investigating claims against Cosby after Temple University employee Andrea Constand publicly accused the comedian of drugging and assaulting her at his Pennsylvania home. Alleged victims: Andrea Constand (left) was one of the first victims to publicly accuse Cosby  when she filed a lawsuit against him in 2005. His team sought to discredit her by revealing that her mother asked Cosby for money before she went to police. Beth Ferrier (right) is another woman who want to accuse Cosby that same year, but his team stopped a story from being published in the National Enquirer . The Enquirer was looking to report on claims by another woman, Beth Ferrier, but Cosby’s team effectively silenced that woman’s story by offering an exclusive story from Cosby telling his side of the story. Suing: Tamara Green claims to have been sexually assaulted by Cosby in the 1970s and told her story in 2005 to two outlets. She is now suing Cosby for defamation, claiming his team as repeatedly depicted her as a liar in the media . They employed the same tactic against Constand, whose mother allegedly asked Cosby to ‘make things right with money’ before her daughter went to the police to report the crime and one of Cosby’s lawyers called the move ‘a classic shakedown’, according to TV show Celebrity Justice which reported on the suit at the time. In court, Cosby’s legal team acknowledged that the lawyer in question was Singer. Constand’s suit was later settled out of court for an unknown sum. Also in 2005, a woman named Tamara Green said she was sexually assaulted by Cosby in Los Angeles in the 1970s and told her story on the Today Show and to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Cosby’s lawyers called Green’s claims ‘absolutely false’ and even offered ‘damaging information about her to the newspaper. As more and more women came forward in recent weeks to accuse Cosby, Green went public again with her story and Cosby’s lawyers reacted the same way - saying her claims were ‘a 10-year discredit accusation that proved to be nothing at the time, and is still nothing’. Green is now suing Cosby for defamation, claiming she has been depicted as a liar with these statements and continued assault on her reputation. ‘I want it put to a jury. I want it ended, finally. I want my name restored,’ she said earlier this month. One of the most shocking claims in the scandal comes from a woman named Judith Huth who says she was just 15 years old when Cosby got her drunk and forced her to perform a sex act on him at the Playboy Mansion. So young: Judith Huth  claims she was sexually assaulted by Cosby at the Playboy Mansion when she was just 15 years old. His team sought to discredit her claims by revealing she unsuccessfully tried to sell her story to a tabloid a decade ago. Pictured with Cosby around the time of the assault . Huth filed a lawsuit against Cosby this month, but his lawyer Singer has tried to discredit the claims by revealing that Huth unsuccessfully attempted to sell her story to a tabloid a decade ago. Celebrity: Former supermodel Janice Dickinson is another one of the more than two dozen women who have come forward to accuse Cosby. Cosby's team threatened Buzzfeed as they were preparing an article on her account . In court records, Singer has called her claims ‘meritless’ and a ‘shakedown’. Cosby’s legal team is just as threatening with the media, and have in recent weeks sent letters to outlets like CNN and the New York Daily News urging them to stop their coverage of the scandal. ‘The media has consistently refused to look into or publish information about various women whose stories are contradicted by their own conduct or statement,’ Singer wrote in a letter to The Daily News, obtained by the Times. Cosby’s lawyers also tried to stop Buzzfeed from publishing an account from former supermodel Janice Dickinson, who has also accused the comedian of sexual assault. ‘You proceed at your own peril,’ Singer wrote to the website, pointing out inconsistencies between Dickinson’s story and what she wrote in her memoir. Just yesterday in a story published in the New York Post, Singer blamed the media for reporting on claims from women he doesn’t believe have been properly vetted. ‘You [the media] don’t need private investigators to find out information about the accusers. A simple Google search will obtain the information,’ Singer said in a statement. Singer was commenting on a story in which it was revealed that Cosby is allegedly paying six-figure fees to a team of private investigators digging dirt on his accusers. A source told the paper that Cosby has hired a Glendale, California firm to discredit his many alleged victims' stories. Cosby allegedly spoke with his legal and public relations teams about the sex scandal, and his response to it, at a recent meeting. 'If you’re going to say to the world that I did this to you, then the world needs to know, ‘What kind of person are you? Who is this person that’s saying it?’ ' Cosby said, according to an anonymous source who was present at the meeting. 'You can’t say that I put something in your coffee, threw you in a cab and then you go on and live a high-profile life, a famous life and you never complain. You mean you never reported it to the police? You never tell anyone?' Cosby continued, referring to one of his accusers, Beverly Johnson. Johnson claimed that Cosby raped her after slipping a drug into her cappuccino during a visit to his home in the 1980s. Another source who says they have worked with Cosby for at least a decade confirmed the tactic and said it has already been successful in finding information to discredit both Johnson and another alleged victim, Katherine McKee. Inconsistencies: A source says the tactic has already been successful in turning up evidence to discredit claims made by Beverly Johnson (left) and Katherine McKee (right) The team discovered that Johnson's live-in boyfriend at the time only heard her say nice things about Cosby and that McKee, an ex-girlfriend of Sammy Davis Jr, wrote posts praising the comedian online after the alleged rape, according to the Post. In a published interview, McKee also once said she is 'used to lying'. McKee, now 65, is the latest woman to publicly come forward to accuse Cosby, saying the comedian raped her in a Michigan hotel room in the early 1970s after inviting her to a party on a boat in Detroit. The former actress, who appeared on Sanford and Son and even The Bill Cosby Show, never spoke of the incident in public before last week. 'It was a rape, but it seemed so strange to call it that. We think of rape as a stranger who attacks you in a parking lot,' McKee, now a casting agent, told the New York Daily News. 'I chalked it up to another powerful person in Hollywood who just felt he could take what he wanted from women.' Cosby's attorney Martin Singer would not confirm whether the comedian had hired any private detectives.","Comedian's lawyers and publicists have kept rape claims out of the media by discrediting accusers and pressuring news outlets not to publish .

"New York Police Department officers are letting minor crimes slide in the wake of the murder of two cops shot while on duty in Brooklyn just over a week ago, claim sources within the department. An unnamed NYPD supervisor told the New York Post that his officers are writing significantly fewer summonses and 'probably only making arrests when they have to - like when a store catches a shoplifter.' 'I'm not writing any summonses. Do you think I'm going to stand there so someone can shoot me or hit me in the head with an ax?' one cop told the Post. Scroll down for video . NYPD officers are letting minor crimes slide in the wake of the murder of two cops shot while on duty in Brooklyn just over a week ago, claim sources within the department . 'I'm concerned about my safety. I want to go to home to my wife and kids.' A union mandate requiring that two patrol cars respond to all police calls – introduced following the shootings of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu – has also contributed to slower response times to non-emergencies. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association's directive is creating a manpower shortage that is delaying response times to crimes such as burglaries and car crashes to as much as four hours, according to the paper. Tensions between police, the city's elected leadership and residents have been heightened since the December 20 slayings of two police officers by Ismaaiyl Brinsley. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was booed on Monday by the newest members of the NYPD as he delivered a speech at the academy graduation ceremony. Several boos could be heard at Madison Square Garden as de Blasio took the podium in front of 884 newly-minted cops. Booed: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was heckled and booed as he spoke at the NYPD academy graduation ceremony at Madison Square Garden on Monday . Mayor de Blasio ignored the boos and thanked the new recruits for their service to the city of New York . At least one cadet could be heard shouting 'traitor!' the New York Post reports. Then, when de Blasio remarked that the new officers would be confronted with problems they didn't make, someone from the crowd shouted, 'You created them!' The heckler was met with applause and cheering. The incident shows that mistrust has taken hold even among the NYPD's newest officers. On Saturday, hundreds of cops turned their backs on de Blasio as he spoke at the funeral for Officer Rafael Ramos, one of two NYPD cops gunned down by a fanatic who was enraged about recent police brutality cases - including the death of Staten Island resident Eric Garner. The Mayor has come in for sharp criticism from the police union after expressing sympathy for protesters who took to the streets in the wake of a grand jury's failure to indict the NYPD cop who allegedly put Garner in a chokehold. At least one of the new NYPD academy graduate shouted 'traitor!' as the mayor took the podium in front of 884 newly minted cops . Tense: The Mayor (left) and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton (second from left) stood on stage with police union president Patrick Lunch (second from right) - who has said de Blasio has 'blood on his hands' Thousands of friends and family members filled Madison Square Garden - along with the nearly 900 recruits . In a speech following the grand jury decision, de Blasio, whose children are half-black, recounted how he told his teenage son Dante how to deal with the police and that he might be discriminated against by the NYPD. Patrolman's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said de Blasio had 'blood on his hands' in the death of Ramos and his partner Officer Wenjian Liu, who were assassinated on December 20 as they sat in their squad car in Brooklyn. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said on Sunday that the strife between de Blasio and the rank-and-file officers is likely to last 'for some time.' City Hall and the Patrolman's Benevolent Association are in the midst of rancorous contract negotiations that are set to go to arbitration - further exacerbating the strife. The Mayor and Lynch - his most outspoken critic - came face-to-face on Monday when they posed together for a photo for an award that the PBA gives out for the top squad sergeant from the graduating class. Lynch's son Kevin is among the graduating class.","NYPD officers are letting minor crimes slide in the wake of the murder of two cops shot  just over a week ago .

"Ronnie and Donnie Galyon may be the world's oldest conjoined twins, but when they celebrated their 63rd birthday recently, they decided to keep it young — with a trip to Florida's amusement parks. The Galyon twins, of  Ohio, unofficially reached the milestone the day after they turned 63 on Oct. 28. They beat out the previous record held for more than seven decades by Giacomo and Giovanni Battista Tocci, who were born in Italy in 1877 and lived to be 63. Scroll down for video . Meet Ronnie and Donnie Galyon, the world's unofficial oldest-living conjoined twins. They celebrated their 63rd birthday in October . The Galyons (pictured above in July) beat out the previous record holders,  Italian twins Giacomo and Giovanni Battista Tocci, who were born in 1877 and lived to be 63. The Toccis held the record for more than 70 years . Months earlier, on July 5, they lived one day longer than Chang and Eng Bunker, another set of conjoined twins who claimed the world's second-place spot in longevity. They celebrated that milestone with a block party in their hometown of Beavercreek, just outside of Dayton. Relatives say Ronnie and Donnie, veterans of the circus and carnivals, are enjoying their time in the spotlight. 'It's a lifelong dream, and they are absolutely loving it,' their brother, Jim Galyon, told MLive.com. Jim Galyon took the twins to Florida as their birthday gift. 'While they could still get out, I said, 'Guys, let's go ahead and make the trek this year,' he added. The twins live outside Dayton, Ohio with their younger brother Jim (pictured in July) Jim and his wife Mary, who share a house with Ronnie and Donnie, enjoy a sunny July day with Ronnie and Donnie (file photo) The Galyon brothers spent the birthday visiting Disney World and Busch Gardens, MLive.com reported. At Christmas, there was a tree and plenty of presents in the living room of the house Ronnie and Donnie share with their brother Jim and his wife, Mary. 'We have a lot to be grateful for,' Jim said. 'They are really healthy.' The twins are yet to receive their official certificate from the Guinness World Records confirming they're the longest-living conjoined twins in history. But they're living as if they're already first place. Ronnie and Donnie (pictured in July) supported their family from the age of four by performing in carnival sideshows in the U.S. and circuses throughout Central and South America . Ronnie and Donnie are joined at the waist and face each other. They have four arms and four legs and separate hearts and stomachs but share a lower digestive tract, a groin, a rectum and penis, over which Donnie has control. The twins were born healthy in Dayton, Ohio, in October 1951 but stayed in the hospital for two years as doctors tried to figure out how to separate them. When experts said they could not guarantee both babies would survive an operation to part them, the parents said they would stay as they were. The men agree that was the best decision. 'The good Lord made us,' Ronnie has said. 'Let our savior do it.' They had trouble sleeping for years, but received a custom-designed bed that Ronnie says allowed him to 'sleep like a baby' From the age of four, the twins supported their family by performing in carnival sideshows in the U.S. and circuses throughout Central and South America. When they tried to return to school, teachers told them to leave because they were too distracting to the other students. They continued their work at circuses in Central and South America where they performed magic tricks and were treated 'like rock stars', Jim Galyon told MLive.com. They retired in 1991 aged 39 and moved to Beavercreek to be close to Jim, who is younger by 11 years. The twins lived in a hospital until their second birthday in 1953 (right) while doctors tried to figure out how to separate them. When the split seemed dangerous, their parents decided they should stay as they were . In 2010, they battled poor health when Ronnie suffered a viral infection that caused blood clots in his lungs and Jim wanted them to move in with him, but his home was not handicapped-accessible. A family friend contacted the Christian Youth Corps, which helped accommodate the house for the twins' needs, including a kitchen, wife hallways, oversized bathroom and shower. They also received a custom-designed bed from Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which Ronnie said allowed him to 'sleep like a baby'.","The Ohio twins in October celebrated their longevity milestone playing at Florida's amusement parks .

"Claims firms that try to make money at the public’s expense will now face fines that could hit millions of pounds. Ministers announced the penalties yesterday as part of a new regime of rules to crack down on ‘unscrupulous’ claims management companies. Firms found to have broken the rules will be fined up to one fifth of their annual turnover. For the biggest firms, this could run to millions of pounds. Claims firms that try to make money at the public’s expense will now face fines that could hit millions of pounds. Ministers announced the penalties yesterday as part of a new regime of rules to crack down on ‘unscrupulous’ claims management companies . Claims companies offer to help people get compensation for situations such as injury or mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI). They pass people’s details on to legal firms, and then charge customers to act as a middle man. Breaches of the rules include sending out misleading marketing information and wasting time and money by making ‘spurious’ or ‘unsubstantiated’ claims. Claims companies offer to help people get compensation for situations such as injury or mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) Any company that tries to block an investigation by the Claims Management Regulator (CMR), which will impose the fines until the legal ombudsman takes over regulation next month, will also face fines. Rogue private parking firms are at the centre of a surge in complaints about unfair and extortionate penalty notices. Complaints to Citizens Advice are up 41 per cent in a year, while the number of people seeking advice via the charity’s website has tripled to 155,000. CA analysed over 700 calls made to its consumer service in July and September this year and found the average private parking charge was £83. The parking cowboys, who operate everywhere from hospitals to supermarkets, are aided in the multi-million pound rip-off by a sweetheart deal with the DVLA. The DVLA has made almost £25million in five years by selling personal details of millions of motorists to the firms. Justice minister Lord Faulks said: ‘People should not have to have their time wasted by the unscrupulous practices of some claims firms out to make themselves a profit at others’ expense. We are making sure they will have to pay the price themselves if they engage in this kind of behaviour.’ The growth of claims management firms has coincided with a surge in bogus ‘cash for crash’ claims, which cost insurance firms more than £2billion a year and add more than £90 to the average car insurance premium, according to industry experts. A report by MPs this year found firms offer incentives such as free iPads and shopping vouchers to encourage those involved in road accidents to pursue compensation. In the first three months of this year, the CMR issued 126 warnings to firms, and cancelled two companies’ licences to practise. Kevin Rousell, head of the CMR, said the new penalties will tackle some firms’ bad behaviour that ‘causes serious inconvenience to the public’, adding: ‘Reducing malpractice will also help to improve the reputation of those firms who do adhere to the rules and provide a good service to consumers.’ In October, the Government announced that the threshold of what is considered a spam call or text would be lowered dramatically. Watchdog the Information Commissioner’s Office previously had to prove a firm had caused ‘substantial harm’ before it could act, but under new plans they only need to prove ‘annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety’.","Guilty firms will be fined up to one fifth of their annual turnover under rules .

PHE's campaign comes as the Government's Chief Medical Officer warned the idea some people have that roll-ups are less harmful than ordinary cigarettes is wrong. Professor Dame Sally Davies warned that both forms of smoking effectively ‘rot’ the body from the inside. She said that contrary to popular belief that roll-ups are natural and less dangerous, the tobacco contains just as many deadly chemicals. Health officials are concerned that roll-ups are becoming increasingly popular amongst smokers who see them as a cheaper alternative to cigarettes. Smoking: Figures show that fewer in one in five Britons smoke, the lowest level in 80 years . Figures showed that 40 per cent of men and 23 per cent of women smokers use them, up from 18 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in 1990. But 49 per cent mistakenly believe they are less harmful, according to a survey of 627 individuals. Professor Dame Sally Davies said: ‘While many smokers know the damage cigarettes do to their hearts and lungs, they are much less likely to be aware of how harmful smoking is to the body - essentially ‘rotting’ it from the inside out, and roll-ups are no exception. Smokers who use e-cigarettes are likely to stop or reduce their smoking, claims an independent review of trial data. Almost one in 10 smokers using e-cigarettes had been able to quit the habit up to a year later, and around one-third had cut down. The review of two trials is published today in The Cochrane Library, the world’s leading producer of systematic reviews. Controversy continues over whether e-cigarettes have net benefits, amid fears that using them in public places will ‘re-normalise’ smoking, especially among young people, and reverse declining smoking rates. ‘January is a time when many people make New Year’s resolutions to improve their health and try to stop smoking. ‘Millions of people have used Smokefree support (the NHS’s stop smoking programme) and we are hoping that this year, even more will take advantage of the free expertise and resources on offer.’ Figures show that fewer in one in five Britons smoke, the lowest level in 80 years. Health officials want to bring this down even further and they are concerned that rates are much higher in deprived areas. Forest described the campaign as ‘rotten’, ‘poisonous’ and an ‘abuse of public money’. Mr Clark said: ‘There can't be a sane adult in the United Kingdom who isn't well aware of the health risks of smoking. ‘What's really poisonous is the way public health campaigners are constantly trying to scare and harass people with exaggerated claims and dubious statistics. ‘Campaigns like this are an abuse of public money. Education has been replaced by shrill scaremongering that is often counter-productive because it's human nature to switch off when you're being nagged or shouted at on an almost daily basis. ‘This is real life, not a Hammer Horror film.’","Smokers' rights group Forest calls campaign 'poisonous' and 'exaggerated'

"Dunkin' Donuts has added a couple of new hot items to its menu to help ease customers through the winter months. The company announced on Monday that it will immediately start selling chocolate croissants and bagels topped with mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, and herbs at select restaurants. The chocolate croissant features flaky croissant dough and a chocolaty filling, while the Tomato Mozzarella Supreme Bagel is a plain bagel with mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and herb topping. Dunkin' Donuts has added a couple of new hot items to its menu to help ease customers through the winter months . Both items are best served hot, and will be on the menu until some undisclosed point in 2015. Dunkin’ wouldn’t specify which restaurants will be sell the new items. The company also said on Tuesday that it is conducting a special New Year's themed Twitter sweepstakes among followers of its Twitter page until Wedesnday . Winners can receive a year’s worth of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee or a $100 gift card to the store. The new eatables are the first to be added to the company's menu since it announced in October that was rolling out a croissant-doughnut hybrid. The chain launched its 'Croissant Donut' nationally for a limited time starting on November 3 and insisted that it wasn't anything like the infamous 'Cronut'. The Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York City introduced its now trademarked Cronut in 2013 and it quickly became a viral sensation that spawned numerous knockoffs. The chocolate croissant features flaky croissant dough and a chocolaty filling and will be served warm . The Tomato Mozzarella Supreme Bagel is a plain bagel with mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and herb topping . Last summer, Dunkin' also introduced a croissant-doughnut in South Korea it dubbed a 'New York Pie Donut.' John Costello, Dunkin's president of global marketing and innovation, said in a phone interview that bakers around the country have been mixing doughnuts and croissants for at least 20 years. He said Dunkin' is constantly tracking consumer and bakery trends and has been looking at pastry 'combinations' for several years. 'Are we copying a specific bakery in New York? The answer is no,' Costello said in a phone interview. Dunkin' had reported disappointing quarterly sales in October and warning it might struggle to make its long-term growth targets for the financial year. Among the challenges the company is facing is increased competition, with chains including Taco Bell going after the breakfast crowd. Dunkin', based in Canton, Massachusetts, has nevertheless been opening new U.S. locations and last week said it sees potential for more than 17,000 U.S. locations over time, up from its current 8,000.

"It is known as the land of fire and ice and these pictures show how Iceland really does live up to its reputation. Captured by Israeli photographer Erez Marom, these spectacular photos highlight the frozen beauty of Iceland's wintery landscapes as well as the dramatic eruptions that send molten lava flowing for miles. The 34-year-old photographer snapped the images in the area around the Holuhraun volcano, which dramatically erupted in August this year and has been spewing 1,000 degree Centigrade lava ever since. He also ventured into glaciers within the protected Vatnajökull National Park to capture close-up shots of smooth, blue-tinged ice caves as well as snapping a rare picture of tonnes of fish frozen stiff in a fjord. With his pictures, Mr Moran hoped to show the contrast between Iceland's 27 square-mile largest active lava field and the frozen glacial formations that surround it.

"A man has been left stunned after an ambulance arrived at his house to take his wife to a hospital appointment – three months after she died. Chris Davidson, from Swindon, Wiltshire, was preparing for the first Christmas without his wife, Valerie - who passed away in September – when the ambulance turned up on Christmas Eve. The 61-year-old said paramedics told him they had come to collect his wife of more than 21 years to take her to hospital for dialysis treatment. Chris Davidson, 61, from Swindon, Wiltshire (pictured), was preparing for the first Christmas without his wife of more than 21 years - who passed away in September – when the ambulance turned up on Christmas Eve . The widower was forced to explain to the driver, who had been sent by Arriva Transport Solutions – a firm which provides transport for NHS organisations - that his beloved partner had passed away. He said that while the staff couldn't be more apologetic, he was disappointed by Arriva's response. He said: 'I was in a state of shock that this could have happened, on that day of all days. 'It's bad enough to make a mistake like that on any day, let alone on Christmas Eve. I just couldn't believe it. 'I couldn't say a bad word against the two members of staff who arrived. They were dumbfounded and really apologetic. 'But I'm fuming with Arriva, because when I called them all I got was that it ""wouldn't happen again"", which made me madder. Paramedics - sent Arriva Transport Solutions - had arrived to take Valerie Davidson to Swindon's Great Western Hospital for dialysis treatment but were told by her husband that she had died three months ago . 'My wife was ill for quite some time and had to receive dialysis. I used to take her to the hospital myself but then she gradually got so ill that they had to take her in an ambulance. 'She gradually got worse and in September had to go into intensive care. She was far too young.' Mrs Davidson died from Kidney failure aged 57, following a ten-year battle with breast cancer, diabetes and chronic myeloid leukaemia. As a result of her medical conditions, in the weeks leading up to her death she had been receiving dialysis at Swindon's Great Western Hospital three times a week. Mr Davidson said he is angry that the blunder was allowed to happen, especially on Christmas Eve . Arriva had provided her with transport to and from the hospital after she became too unwell for her husband to be able to take her himself. After she was taken into intensive care, where she later died, the ambulances were cancelled. However, a mistake meant she was added back onto the rota over the Christmas period. Staff from the hospital transport services arrived at the widower's home at 6.30am on December 24. Ed Potter, head of South West Arriva Transport Solutions, has now apologised for the mistake and said he will work to ensure it does not happen again. He said: 'I am sorry for the distress and upset caused by the arrival of an ambulance to Mr Davidson's home. 'As a dialysis patient, Mrs Davidson was taken in and out of hospital regularly until September this year when she sadly died. 'After Mrs Davidson was admitted to hospital in September, we were notified by the hospital and suspended the bookings. 'While planning and scheduling the journeys to take place over the Christmas period, one of our journey planners reinstated the booking in error and that is why an ambulance was sent. 'The booking records have now been permanently closed to ensure this does not happen again. 'We have contacted Mr Davidson to apologise for the error.'","Chris Davidson left stunned when ambulance turned up on Christmas Eve .

"Smartphones and social media are being harnessed by criminal gangs to send illegal sales of potentially dangerous sleeping pills, slimming tablets and Viagra soaring (file picture) Smartphones and social media are being harnessed by criminal gangs to send illegal sales of potentially dangerous sleeping pills, slimming tablets and Viagra soaring, according to Britain’s drugs watchdog. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) believes a combination of smartphones allowing people easier access to the internet, and ease of promotion via social media, has allowed illicit suppliers to target buyers more effectively. This year, the agency has targeted gangs’ internet operations for the first time, removing 18,671 YouTube videos directing viewers to websites illegally selling prescription and counterfeit drugs. Despite their actions, the MHRA reports a huge rise in black market sales of the drugs to people who may be too embarrassed to seek help from their doctor. Over the course of 2014, the agency seized 1.2 million doses of illegally-supplied erectile dysfunction drugs including Viagra, 383,000 slimming products and 331,000 doses of sleeping pills, tranquillisers and anti-depressants. Other drugs being sold illegally include hair-loss treatments, cognitive enhancers and anabolic steroids used by body builders. Alistair Jeffrey, head of enforcement at the drugs watchdog, said: ‘Smartphones have allowed people greater access to the internet and all of a sudden this accessibility, combined with social media, has made a significant difference in how criminals reach consumers. ‘This is something we are looking at now in a serious way. There is a phenomenal market out there.’ Raids organised by the MHRA have found drugs stored in abysmal conditions, he added. Mr Jeffrey, a former detective superintendent who previously ran the Metropolitan Police’s child abuse investigation command centre, said: ‘We’ve had cases where there have been mouse and rat droppings around the blister packs. ‘These people are not interested in sanitary conditions, they are in it for the money. ‘Besides the obvious risks of taking medicines made from rat poison and other substitutes used by gangs, there are also dangers in taking medicines without proper consultation. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency believes smartphones has allowed illicit drug suppliers to target buyers more effectively (picture posed by model) ‘There are definitely health risks because a patient might have a condition that means they should not take a certain drug.’ Mr Jeffrey said patients viewing the YouTube footage are directed to other sites purporting to be officially-registered pharmacies, which sell fake and potentially dangerous medicines. The World Health Organisation believes that about half of all drugs sold online are counterfeits. Many of the treatments are out-of-date or have been contaminated due to storage in appalling, unhygienic conditions. The growth in illegal sales of prescription drugs is partly believed to be driven by the fact patients are unwilling to discuss certain embarrassing issues such as hairloss, being overweight or sexual dysfunction with their family doctor. Instead they are resorting to seeking out their own cures online in the privacy of their homes. Most of the drugs being sold originate from China or India. Bernard Leroy, director of the International Institute of Research Against Counterfeit Medicines in Paris, said: ‘We are in a situation where internet usage is growing so fast that we are at risk of losing control. ‘This will become a major issue for public health in coming years. People are more and more focused on obtaining these medicines and people are going to the internet for them’","Smartphones and social media used by criminal gangs selling drugs .

"These pictures from inside a McDonald's show the moment a masked robber pulled out a knife and started threatening terrified workers. The brazen thief, dressed in a black and white striped jumper - much like Ronald McDonald's nemesis the Hamburglar, walked into the fast food restaurant before vaulting the counter and brandishing a six-inch knife. He then forced staff to open a safe and hand over cash, before leaping back over the tills and making a getaway in a van parked outside. CCTV images show the masked robber entering (left) a McDonald's restaurant before forcing staff to open a safe as he threatened them with a six-inch knife . The burglar, who did not harm anyone in the restaurant, is said to have escaped with a bag full of 20p coins. The robbery took place shortly after 1am on November 27 at the McDonald's at Parsonage Retail Park in Leigh, Greater Manchester. Traumatised staff described the tattooed burglar as being white, about 5ft 7in tall, of slim build and having a local accent. As well as the black and white jumper, the man was wearing grey jogging bottoms with stripes down each leg, white trainers, black gloves, and a black balaclava. Police are investigating and are appealing for witnesses and information. Detective Constable Stuart Woodhead, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Fortunately no-one was hurt, but staff were understandably terrified as the man threatened them with a knife.

"Hundreds of Qatar Airways passengers were delayed for more than six hours after a mouse scurried through the cabin of an aircraft at Madrid’s airport. The rodent stowaway was spotted running down the aisle, giving passengers a scare, as the plane landed at Adolfo Suarez Madrid-Barajas Airport from Doha on Sunday. Instead of being cleaned and prepared for the six-hour return journey from Spain to Qatar, the Boeing 777-400 was pulled from service and fumigated, causing a delay for passengers who were waiting to board. Passengers were given a scare when the mouse was spotted running down the aisle of the cabin . Flight QR150 was scheduled to depart at 3pm but passengers had to wait more than six hours while the intruder was exterminated and the fumes cleared. The rodent was found dead after the cabin was sprayed, but security protocol meant passengers had to wait until it was safe to board, according to Spanish newspaper 20 Minutos. During the delay there were long queues at Qatar Airways’ customer service desk as many passengers had missed connections to Thailand, Singapore and Bali, the newspaper reported. It said three young people from Mallorca were travelling to Bali to celebrate New Year’s Eve, but lost a day as a result of the delay. The mouse was found dead after the plane was removed from service and fumigated (file photo) Qatar Airways has told passengers it will pay any costs incurred as a result of the disruption, 20 Minutos reported. There have been several incidents this year where mice or rats were found on a plane, leading to lengthy delays for travellers. In recent months Air India, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Swiss have had to delay flights while hunting for rodents or fumigating an aircraft. The animals must be removed immediately as they could gnaw through important wires on an aircraft. Earlier this year, an Air India official said rodents on planes are a ‘common phenomenon’ worldwide and they could ‘get in anywhere’, although they normally sneak onto planes via catering vehicles loaded with food.","Rodent was spotted as the Boeing 777-400 landed in Madrid on Sunday .

"A hippopotamus left with broken teeth and tears streaming down its face after jumping out of a moving lorry was killed when bungling zoo staff dropped him on the ground a second time while trying to rescue him. Ahe, a 32-year-old male hippopotamus, was hurt with a damaged leg and  teeth but still alive after falling from the moving lorry which was ferrying him to a zoo in Taiwan. But he died when   zoo staff hitched the 1.8 tonne animal into a harness that could not carry his weight - and he was dropped him for a second time. Scroll down for video . Pain: Tears stream down the face of the injured male hippo after he fell off the back of a lorry on his way to a Taiwan zoo . Medics said that the hippo died from injuries sustained as a result of being dropped the second time while being moved to a temporary shelter in the botched rescue attempt in Taichung city, a special municipality located in western Taiwan. The initial accident happened last Friday when the panicked hippo jumped from the truck in which it was being transported, breaking a leg. Television footage showed the enormous animal lying on the road -- where it remained for several hours -- with white fluid oozing from its eyes. Then, when the hippo was being taken back to the farm for treatment of its injuries, the cable on a hoist broke and its container crashed to the ground from a height of two metres (6.5 feet). A spokesman for the Agricultural Bureau in the Taiwanese city of Taichung said: 'Sadly the 32-year-old animal died overnight as a result of his injuries. 'An autopsy showed that the internal damage caused a massive supply of toxins to be released into his blood resulting in death.' Local police who had calls from locals about the animal said several people have reported a dinosaur on the road causing some confusion and suspicion that it was a hoax.

'The city government has asked prosecutors to look into the case,' Chen Ming-hui, a local official, told AFP, adding that the ranch has been ordered to make a plan to improve the management of the rest of the animals there. 'The animal was not properly protected during the transportation process, leading to its injuries. What's worse, it had not received due medical treatment the last two days,' said Chu Tseng-hung, the head of the non-profit Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan.

"A man spent four years creating the perfect star-studded proposal video for his girlfriend after persuading her favourite stars to take part in the secret project. Session drummer Jim MacAulay recruited stars including Ed Sheeran, Cee Lo Green, Ronan Keating and X Factor host Dermot O’Leary for the video for girlfriend Sophie Hancock, 30. Singers Martine McCutcheon and musician Nile Rodgers also featured in the five-minute proposal video, which Jim played to her just before Christmas. Scroll down for video . Jim MacAulay spent four years collating a video proposal for fiance  Sophie Hancock featuring the likes of Dermot O'Leary, Bob Geldof, Nile Rogers but Ed Sheeran but David Hasselhoff didn't make the cut . The video starts with English comedian and actor Adam Buxton calling Jim an 'extraordinary man' and telling Sophie to marry him. It then cuts to a blank screen with the message 'Sorry it’s taken so long...' before the words, 'LET’S GET MARRIED!! Please!?' appear on the screen. Thinking Out Loud singer Ed Sheeran appears and shares a bizarre story about conceiving children before telling the couple to get married and 'have a bunch of kids'. X Factor presenter Dermot O’Leary also appears on screen to say: 'Sophie, for the love of the baby Jesus, marry Jim.' The musician joked that he felt under pressure to make the proposal perfect because the pair had been together for 12 years. He said: 'It has to be quite good when you have left it so long to propose. I am lucky that I have got a job where I get to meet lots of famous people. Jim managed to rope in X Factor presenter Dermot O'Leary, left, and chart-topping singer, Ed Sheeran . Musician Nile Rogers and Love Actually actress Martine McCutcheon  lent their support to the proposal video . 'I deliberately asked people who I knew Sophie was a fan of. She loves Ed Sheeran so I was really pleased he was so willing to help out. US singer Cee Lo Green also tells Sophie to marry Jim before Ronan Keating jokes: 'Sophie look I am sorry but you can’t have me but I tell you what, you can have your man Jim, go on.' Actress Martine McCutcheon makes an appearance with the words '(more famous at time of recording)' appearing underneath her as she also encourages the couple to get hitched. Even Bob Geldof gets involved, saying: 'Sophie, we’re over, there is no use waiting for me, just go to Jim, just marry him and just forget about us.' Jim, who lives with Sophie in Kings Heath, Birmingham, spent four years creating the video before surprising his partner with it at a friend’s dinner party last Tuesday. After four years of waiting, Sophie accepted Jim's offer of marriage after watching the celebrity-filled film . Jim, a session drummer, used to work with Rudimental who asked Ed Sheeran to appear on the video . 'I think it’s a video she’ll keep for a long time. It took four years because you can’t just go up to people and ask them, you have to meet them and establish that you aren’t an idiot . 'I was there when most of them were filmed. I work away a lot with different bands so got to meet most of them at radios or festivals. 'All of the people on the list are people Sophie likes so it is a bit of an eclectic mix. 'I think my favourite is Adam Buxton because I think he was the first one and we are both big fans. 'I met Dermot O’Leary when I was doing a live radio session and I used to work with Rudimental so they got Ed Sheeran for me when they did a US tour with him. 'We organised a surprise party for Sophie at a friend’s house under the pretense of it being a Christmas party. 'She was pretty surprised and excited, but I think really she was relieved I had asked. She said yes thankfully so it was all worthwhile.' Fyfe Dangerfield of the band the Guillmots, left, joined the proposal parade and comedian Adam Buxton, who was one of the first to record his message, is one of Jim's favourites as he and Sophie are both big fans . Boyzone's Ronan Keating, left, and a shadowy Gaz Coombes from Supergrass were also stars of the video . Sophie, a research manager, added: 'About 10 minutes after we arrived the host said her daughter had recorded a message for everyone so we all gathered round and then it cut to Jim's video. 'We've been together for 12 years and he was secretly working on the video for about four years. 'It was worth the wait though. Of course I said ""yes"".' The video has already been viewed by 1,800 people after it was uploaded to YouTube and yesterday Jim revealed that some celebrities didn’t make the cut. Cee Lo Green, left, was initially reluctant to appear on the video. Right, Tim Wheeler from Ash joined in too .

"Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia has been accused of blowing a fuse in a New Jersey airport Saturday morning over a missed Jamaica-bound flight. After reaching Newark Liberty International Airport, Sabathia and the 11 other people he was traveling with were told it was too late for them to get on the plane, TMZ Sports reported. Port Authority was contacted after 'CC started freaking out' at airline workers, a source told the website. Incident: Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia reportedly blew a fuse in a New Jersey airport Saturday morning over a missed Jamaica-bound flight . Sabathia was calmed down by police officers, who did not arrest or cite anyone, TMZ Sports reported. The baseball player arranged a later trip on behalf of his group, which successfully arrived in Jamaica, according to the website. A Port Authority spokesman told MailOnline 12 travelers showed up together at the airport at 6:45am for a 7am flight to Montego Bay, Jamaica. The group had not gone through security screenings yet and would not have made it onto the plane in time, so United Airlines employees declined to let them board, the spokesman said. The spokesman said he could not confirm if Sabathia was one of the travelers in the incident. A different flight was booked for Montego Bay, the spokesman said, and confirmed that there were no arrests or summonses  from the incident. Sabathia has a degenerative knee condition in his right knee, and must undergo plasma treatments in order to play this spring, according to The New York Post. Both the Yankees and a representative for Sabathia did not immediately return a request for comment from MailOnline.

"Medicine man Charles Chipps Sr, 67, is facing life in prison for allegedly raping and sexually abusing girls during spiritual ceremonies in South Dakota . A Native American medicine man is facing trial after he allegedly raped and sexually abused children on a remote reservation. Charles Chipps Sr, 67, was known as a skilled healer in the Oglala Lakota tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation in South Dakota. He is now being held in federal prison in Missouri awaiting trial on 15 counts of rape, sexual abuse and intimidation of six minors, some as young as five years old. He faces life in prison and a fine of $250,000, according to an FBI statement last year. According to The Washington Post, Chipps' alleged victims were abused while he performed spiritual ceremonies in traditional sweat lodges. On his remote family compound, eight miles from the tiny village of Wanblee, Chipps allegedly forced girls to undress in the dark huts and abused them, according to court documents. The Sweat Lodge - typically made of young tree branches lashed together and covered with hideskins over  a fire in the center - is a place where tribe members go for mental and physical healing and to seek answers for spiritual questions. Some adults would bring their children to Chipps because of his skills in tribal traditions. At a hearing to determine whether Chipps should be jailed prior to trial, forensic interviewer, Hollie Strand, for the Child Advocacy Center took the stand in 2013. According to The Post, she said Chipps allegedly forced one child to kiss him and another perform to oral sex - before clicking his fingers and forcing them to trade places. He would make young girls watch while he had sex with others, according to Ms Strand's testimony. According to tribe members, one girl who was brought to meet Chipps committed suicide following the alleged abuse, while another female relative has attempted to take her own life. Although several relatives spoke before the court in his favor, a judge jailed Chipps, pending trial. A stock image of a traditional sweat lodge. A Native American medicine man, Charles Chipps Sr, is facing trial on 15 counts of rape and sexual abuse after he allegedly attacked young girls inside the darkened rooms during spiritual ceremonies . Chipps had been originally arrested in 2009 following multiple reports of sexual assault from children made to the tribe's social services agency between 2002 and 2007. It wasn't until one of Chipps' sons told a tribal police officer what he believed was going on because he feared for his own children. Some of the children in the compound were placed with social services and other family members while Chipps was arrested. Chipps' sister-in-law, Lena Chipps, told The Washington Post that she was horrified when she found out he had allegedly been preying on young members of the tribe. 'When I first found out about Charles, I wanted to get a gun and go shoot him,' she said. However after a year in jail he was freed because the U.S. attorney’s office for South Dakota did not have enough evidence to bring charges. U.S. attorney Brendan V. Johnson, who prosecuted the case, described the difficulties of rooting out sexual predators in Native American communities. He told The Post: 'Victims are placed under tremendous pressure by family members and friends to recant their stories.' The population who live on the Pine Ridge reservation, which sits in the Badlands National Park, has one of the shortest life expectancies in the West - 47 years for men and 52 years for women. Infant mortality rate is five times the U.S. average, and teen suicide is four times higher, according to figures. The reservation also deals with crippling rates of poverty and alcoholism. Problems with alcohol are estimated to affect 85 per cent of families and attribute to 90 per cent of crimes in the isolated area. Chipps remained free until 2013 - until a 13-year-old girl told a school counselor that she had been sexually abused since the age of five. With the new allegations, along with the accusations of other young people, the District Attorney's office along with the FBI, moved in on Chipps. On July 16, 2013, U.S. Attorney  Johnson announced that Chipps was indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly sexually abusing and intimidating members of his family between 2006 and 2010. Chipps was indicted for seven counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, three counts of abusive sexual contact of a minor, three counts of aggravated incest, and two counts of witness intimidation. Older victims and some from other states have also come forward, The Washington Post reported. The 67-year-old has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyer, Terry L. Pechota, has said he is not well enough to stand trial and is 'unable to recall things of the past', according to a court filing. The investigation is ongoing and involves the FBI, the Bureau of Indian Affairs-Office of Justice Services, and the Oglala Sioux Tribe Department of Public Safety.

"A group of gipsies are objecting to the expansion of a traveller site and have started a 'not in our back yard' petition. Travellers living at the Cae Garw gipsy and traveller site in Margam, near Port Talbot, South Wales, have contacted council chiefs to complain about plans to expand the site by 11 caravans. There are already 20 pitches on the site, but the Welsh Government has given Neath Port Talbot Council money to expand the site and make more room for travellers. The expansion, which is yet to be given the green light, is set to include 11 new pitches, amenity blocks and 'informal play areas'. Travellers living at the Cae Garw gipsy and traveller site in Margam, near Port Talbot, South Wales (pictured), have contacted council chiefs to complain about plans to expand the current 20-pitch site by 11 caravans . The council was given funding to carry out the works earlier this year and must purchase adjacent farm land to accommodate the extended site boundary. Residents at Cae Garw said there was a divide over the council plans between those who had been there for decades and newcomers. One elderly resident said there would be an exodus to local car parks in protest at the expansion, if it went ahead. He told MailOnline: 'Most people here are happy with the way things are and don't want this changed. 'This site is already overcrowded and expanding it will only attract more people, it's like an advertisement. 'If it goes ahead people will be heading for Port Talbot and setting up in the first car park they come to. That's what I'll be doing. 'We have lived here since it opened 30 years ago, a lot of people have, but this will drive them back to their old way of life.' He added: 'If this expansion happens there will be overcrowding at local schools and at the doctors. It's disgraceful. 'The council would be better off saving its money. We are happy with things the way they are.' Rob Jones, a councillor in Margam, said: 'If you live in a lovely, countryside area, in a close-knit community, would you want strangers coming in?' Jeffrey Jones, another long term resident at the site, said: 'It's not a question of the people, it's the space. 'How would these councillors suddenly like a lot of houses built opposite where they live? Nobody wants that.' But mother-of-seven Lucy Price, 30, originally from Ireland, welcomed the expansion plans. She said: 'I know some people here are against this but they tend to be the older generation. 'People here with families support the expansion. The children would like to see a park built as well. 'I think more people should be able to come here if they want. There are more people for this than against.' Rob Jones, a councillor in Margam, said he has been approached by about a third of the travellers who live at the site and object to the council's plans. He told MailOnline: 'I have been approached by some members of the community that don't want an expansion on the site. 'Out of the residents on the site, there are about a third that are vehemently opposed to any expansion. 'They are closed communities, very family-orientated and about a third are not supportive to the point that they are trying to start a petition to prevent the council from going ahead. 'About another third are not bothered one way or another what happens, while another third would encourage more travellers to the site.' He agreed that those who object to the expansion of the site are against it because they are worried about new travellers disrupting the camp. He said: 'People think gipsies come and go, but there are some at the site which have been there for more than 40 years. 'They are entrenched there. If you live in a lovely, countryside area, in a close-knit community, would you want strangers coming in? I think that's the perception they have. One elderly resident said there would be an exodus to local car parks in protest at the move, if it went ahead . 'They are all related or close friends, they don't want people to come in and disrupt the harmony. 'They don't want bad neighbours, to put it simply. 'There's sometimes a fear of the unknown. Their fear is that if someone bad turns up then it would cause problems on the site.' Mr Jones said the expansion of the site would occur over the next 15 years, if given the go-ahead. Gareth Nutt, director of environment at Neath Port Talbot Council, said there was a need for additional pitches up to 2026 and confirmed a consultation process has been launched. He said: 'This planning application proposes the provision of additional pitches as a means to address this proposed need.'","Gipsies object to council plans to expand traveller site with 11 caravans .

"The number of man-hours lost through strikes has almost doubled in the last year as workers ranging from midwives to firefighters took part in walkouts. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show 782,000 days were lost because of labour disputes in the year to October, compared with 405,000 a year earlier. There were 27 stoppages in October alone, involving 109,000 workers. Suggesting a rise in industrial militancy, 745,000 workers were involved in the strikes in the last year, more than twice as many as in 2013. Scroll down for video . The number of man-hours lost through strikes has almost doubled in the last year. Pictured, nurses and midwives striking at Stafford General Hospital today in October . This included a strike over pay involving hundreds of thousands of nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants and ambulance drivers. Even the Royal College of Midwives took part in the walkout in the organisation’s first strike in its 133-year history. Scans and home visits for expectant mothers were delayed, while dozens of less-urgent 999 calls went unattended by paramedics. Members of the Unite union alone have been involved in more than 150 days of strike action in 2014, an increase of a quarter on last year. This does not even include disputes which have not been resolved or are looming. Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of Unite, said strike action had risen because working people have simply ‘had enough’. He said: ‘They have had enough of a failed, ideological economic strategy of austerity, real term pay cuts, rising costs and little hope. ‘The only growth experienced by most workers is a devastating growth in poverty and food-banks supporting the most vulnerable while everyday costs in rip-off Britain such as rent, transport, food and energy force more into debt and often, despair. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show 782,000 days were lost because of labour disputes in the year to October. Pictured, striking NHS workers on Westminster Bridge . ‘People are rightly outraged when they see the richest in society pocket millions in wage hikes, bonuses, share options and pension pots, much of which appears to be whisked away to the nearest tax haven rather than being spent in the local economy to support jobs and businesses.’ Mr Turner indicated that industrial unrest will continue into the new year and even leading up to the general election. Several high profile disputes remain unresolved, including those in the NHS, fire service and civil service, as well as in the private sector. Thousands of workers in organisations ranging from defence firms and libraries to a homeless charity were also involved in industrial disputes in 2014, while bus drivers in London are among those gearing up for action in the new year. Most of the disputes are now about pay, however, others have centred around pensions, working conditions and job cuts. It comes as the Trades Union Congress claimed wages had fallen by about £2,509 for the average employee since 2010, when adjusted for inflation. Frances O’Grady, of the TUC, said: ‘Government, employers and unions must work together to promote wage led growth. ‘This means increasing pay for those at the bottom with a higher minimum wage and spreading the living wage.’ However, most British workers are finally starting to benefit from above-inflation pay rises, figures showed this month. ONS data showed that wages excluding bonuses are 1.6 per cent higher than last year, while the cost of goods has risen by just one per cent.","Figures show 782,000 days were lost because of labour disputes in the year to October, compared with 405,000 a year earlier .

"The most popular word of 2014 has been revealed, and is not actually a word at all but a symbol meaning love. A heart 'emoji' was the most widely used character in blogs, Twitter and Facebook and in 250,000 global news outlets in the last 12 months, according to analysts. The increasing prominence of the emoji or emoticon shows how symbols are making their way into the English language with the rise of the internet. The heart emoji, typically used to mean love, is the most popular word of 2014 but is not actually a word at all . There are now 722 recognised characters which portray an emotion, expression, or state of mind, or a person, place or thing - with another 250 to be made available over the next year. The list was compiled by the Global Language Monitor in Austin, Texas, which analyses the use of words and symbols in blogs, social media and 250,000 of the most popular online and print news outlets across the world. Researchers found the heart emoji appeared billions of times a day across the world. Other words that rose to popularity in 2014 were 'vape' from the term vaporise, used to refer to electronic or e-cigarettes. This word appeared in the Oxford Dictionary's top word for 2014. Prince George also made the list along with the phenomena blood moon - referring to the blood red colour of the moon after it passes in the earth's shadow, causing the sun's red light to scatter. Paul Payack, president of Global Language Monitor, said: 'The English Language is now undergoing a remarkable transformation unlike any in its 1400 year history - its system of writing, the alphabet, is gaining characters at amazing rate. 'These character are ideographs or pictographs that are called emoji and emoticons. Vape was among the most popular words of 2014, and refers to the now popular use of electronic cigarettes . Ebola was the most widely used name of 2014 after the deadly virus killed thousands in Africa . 'There are about a thousand emoji characters now officially recognised by Unicode Consortium, the official keepers of coding that forms the basis of the internet. 'They regularly review new suggestions with the next 37 or so being finalised for June 2015. 'Then the new emoji can be embedded in any number of devices for any number of languages.' The list is the 15th annual survey compiled by Global Language Media. Last year '404' appeared as the most popular word - the internet error message showing the popularity of online media. Social media and the internet strongly influenced words appearing in the list - with hashtag, photobomb and clickbait all in the list. Ebola earned top place in the list of names - above Pope Francis and Prince George. The project also included the most common phrases for 2014 with 'Hands up, don't shoot' in the number one spot. This phrase was coined by protesters who called for action after the shooting of black teenager Michael Brown in St Louis, Missouri in August. The heart emoji - the symbol for love is one of almost 1,000 in use . Hashtag - the reformed pound sign (#) which often gets topics trending on Twitter . Vape - referring to vaporising, the practice of using an electronic or e-cigarette . Blood Moon - the blood red appearance of the moon caused when it enters the earth's shadow and captures the sun's red rays . Nano - can mean small (1 billionth of a metre) or refer to the type of technology . Photo Bomb - breaking into a pre-arranged assemble for a photo . Caliphate - a form of Islamic political leadership . (White) privilege - The alleged advantages of having lighter colored skin in a diverse society. Bae - term of endearment for an object of desire .

"Patients falsely claiming free prescriptions are fleecing the NHS out of more than £200million a year, figures reveal. Officials are concerned people are routinely walking into High Street chemists pretending to be unemployed or suffering a long-term illness, just so they do not have to pay for medication. Ministers are today launching a crackdown on the fraud by demanding pharmacists and NHS officials thoroughly check patients are entitled to free prescriptions. The DoH estimates 29.4m prescriptions were wrongly handed out for free last year at a cost of £237million . In England, certain groups qualify, including the over-60s, children, new mothers, the unemployed and patients with certain medical conditions such as cancer. Everyone else pays a flat fee of £8.05 per item. But the system is open to abuse because patients just tick a box on a form, and pharmacists take their word for it. The Department of Health estimates 29.4million prescriptions were wrongly handed out for free last year at a cost of £237million. Under a scheme being launched by health minister Dr Daniel Poulter, the NHS’s Business Service Authority will next month begin looking back through records of free prescriptions. Officials are concerned people are routinely walking into High Street chemists pretending to be unemployed or suffering a long-term illness, just so they do not have to pay for medication . They will check details held by the Department for Work and Pensions, and anyone found to be flouting the system will be fined £150. Persistent offenders will be taken to court and, if found guilty, fined £2,500. The Government is also introducing an electronic system to allow pharmacists to check immediately if patients are entitled to free prescriptions. It is expected to be available in all high street chemists by 2018. Dr Poulter said: ‘This abuse of the NHS must stop. Claiming a free prescription when you are not entitled takes money away from other frontline patient services.’ But senior medics said it was ‘totally unacceptable’ to expect pharmacists to police what is already a deeply flawed system. David Branford, of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, added that it would disrupt the trust between pharmacists and patients.","DoH estimates £29.4m prescriptions wrongly handed out for free last year .

"Ukraine was forced to shut down a reactor at its biggest nuclear power plant yesterday following an 'electrical malfunction', the second such incident in the space of a month. One of six reactors at the  Zaporizhia power station in the south-east of the country was automatically disconnected by the plant's 'internal defence mechanism' at 6am yesterday morning. Workers managed to repair to the fault and the reactor was reconnected to the power grid at 22:35, the plant's operator's NPP said in a statement. Shutdown: The Zaporozhiya nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine where one of six reactors was automatically taken off-line yesterday following an electrical fault . Earlier this month another of Zaporizhia's reactors was taken off-line after it suffered a short-circuit leading to widespread blackouts. The plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and the fifth largest in the world, supplies around 40 per cent of Ukraine's nuclear power and was switched on in 1984. The incident has revived memories of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster - the worst nuclear power station accident in history in which 31 people were killed and large amounts of radiation released into the environment. A statement on the Zaporizhia plant's website said radiation levels around the facility remained at normal levels and that the accident was being investigated. Ukraine is in the grip of an energy crisis with authorities in Kiev  refusing to buy coal from the conflict-hit Donetsk and Lugansk regions, fearing it could benefit pro-Russian factions. To make matters worse around half of the country's coal-fuelled power stations are said to need emergency repairs. The Chernobyl disaster was the worst nuclear power station accident in history resulting in the deaths of 31 people and large amounts of radiation being released into the environment . There are fears for the safety of the Zaporizhia plant as lies only 200 kilometres from the rebel-held Donetsk region. Two of Zaporizhia's reactors are due to be decommissioned  in February  having been operating for over 30 years. In May pro-Ukrainian paramilitaries confronted police and security at the plant claiming they had come to remove 'pro-Russian' agitators they claimed were operating inside the plant. Zaporizhia  produces up to 22 percent of all electricity generated in the country.","One of six reactors at the Zaporizhia power station shut down yesterday .

"Doomed marriage: Prince Charles and Diana during a royal tour of Hungary . The BBC has pulled a documentary which sheds light on Prince Charles’s attempts to repair his battered image following the death of Princess Diana. Reinventing The Royals is said to be critical of the prince’s attempt to rebuild his reputation and increase public sympathy for Camilla Parker Bowles. According to the documentary, Charles’s methods left the teenage Prince William feeling he had been ‘used to further his father’s interests’ after details of his first meeting with Mrs Parker Bowles ten months after Diana’s death were leaked to a journalist. The BBC has now postponed the two-part programme, which was due to start broadcasting this Sunday, after an intervention from lawyers known to represent senior royals including Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, according to the Radio Times. The BBC2 documentary is presented by Steve Hewlett, the editor of Panorama during its infamous interview with Diana in 1995 in which she referred to Charles’s affair with Mrs Parker Bowles, saying: ‘There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.’ Mr Hewlett says in an article for the Radio Times that Charles hired Mark Bolland from the Press Complaints Commission to act as his media advisor in what was a departure for the royal family. He says Mr Bolland tried to repair the Prince’s battered image by taking every opportunity to show his different side as a single parent and caring father. His other objective was to increase public acceptance for the woman Charles described as a ‘non-negotiable’ part of his life – Mrs Parker Bowles, who is now Duchess of Cornwall. The decision to postpone was taken late in the day, after the programme was included in schedules released to television listing magazines. Scroll down for video . Royal sources expressed surprise as the royal press office had appeared relaxed about the documentary. Sandy Henney, press secretary to Charles at the time of Diana’s death, told the documentary how when she started her job in 1993 he was being subjected to ‘virulent criticism’ as a bad father who was often compared unfavourably to Diana. The two-part documentary, Reinventing The Royals, is said to be critical of the prince’s attempt to rebuild his reputation and increase public sympathy for Camilla Parker Bowles after the death of Diana . She said: ‘I think he was pretty hurt... if you’ve got a middle-aged balding man and a beautiful princess, it’s a no-brainer as to who is going to get the media coverage.’ Mr Hewlett said 15-year-old Prince William was left distraught when The Sun reported details of his first meeting with Mrs Parker Bowles in June 1998 – less than ten months after Diana died in a Paris car crash. Miss Henney told the documentary: ‘He [William] was understandably really upset because it was private. And apart from being angry and upset that this had got out, he wanted to know how it had happened.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC is delaying broadcast of Reinventing The Royals until later in the New Year while a number of issues including the use of archive footage are resolved.’ Clarence House said: ‘Scheduling is a matter for the broadcasters.’","Two-part documentary Reinventing the Royals was pulled at last minute .

"With the death of his six-year-old daughter, Rebecca, Eric Meyer had suffered a year of heartache and loss, one that will take him many more to get over. So the web designer from Cleveland, Ohio, was ill-prepared to have that grief dragged up again when he logged on to Facebook to discover a picture of her, with the cheery message: 'Eric, here's what your year looked like.' Mr Meyer was just one of a number of the social network's users stunned as a new feature brought them face-to-face with dead loved ones by offering them a selection of their highlights of the year . Insensitive: Facebook's Year In Review feature brought some users face-to-face with bad memories of 2014 . Unleashed just before Christmas, Facebook's Year In Review feature sorts photos automatically from users' profiles, selecting those which had provoked the most responses as 'highlights'. For a number of users, the choices brought back unpleasant memories. Mr Meyer wrote on his blog, meyerweb.com, how, following his daughter Rebecca's death, he had not felt inclined to see his Facebook 'Year In Review', despite seeing his friends' slideshows popping up in his news feed. Then he logged in to the social network shortly before Christmas to find it exhorting him directly to make one of his own. It was decorated with a picture of his late daughter, staring straight at him from the screen. 'Yes, my year looked like that. True enough. My year looked like the now-absent face of my little girl. It was still unkind to remind me so forcefully,' he wrote. When a pet dies, or a Facebook user posts about bad news, clicking the Like button to express sympathy doesn’t feel quite right. So, with this in mind, the social network is said to be thinking of alternative ways for its members to show they care, without appearing tactless or insensitive. It could help to avoid future gaffes like those bumbled into by Facebook's Year In Review, by giving algorithms a more nuanced understanding of why users have interacted with a post. Facebook tycoon Mark Zuckerberg, pictured top right, admitted he is working on a dislike button - but it is unlikely to be called dislike. Speaking at the firm’s offices in California, Mr Zuckerberg said: ‘We need to figure out the right way to do it so [the button] ends up being a force for good, not a force for bad.’ He continued that people could use a button designed to express negative sentiment in the ‘wrong way’, that could be deemed cruel or mean. However, when such a button will be introduced is not known, and the site has been talking about the feature since 2010. Conceding it was not a 'deliberate assault', but a perverse outcome of Facebook's automation, Mr Meyer nevertheless called the incident 'jarring'. 'This inadvertent algorithmic cruelty is the result of code that works in the overwhelming majority of cases, reminding people of the awesomeness of their years, showing them selfies at a party or whale spouts from sailing boats or the marina outside their vacation house,' he wrote. 'But for those of us who lived through the death of loved ones, or spent extended time in the hospital, or were hit by divorce or losing a job or any one of a hundred crises, we might not want another look at this past year.' After Mr Meyer's blog post went viral, Jonathan Gheller, product manager for Facebook, emailed him to apologise. Mr Gheller told The Washington Post: '[The app] was awesome for a lot of people, but clearly in this [Mr Meyer's] case we brought him grief rather than joy.' Mr Meyer was not the only Facebook user to face grief rather than joy in the social network's offer of a Year In Review. New York City-based advertising copywriter Mark Duffy revealed on Twitter how Facebook had automatically selected a picture of his dead father's ashes to entice him to see his Year In Review. It was tastefully framed by a picture of a group of stick men who appeared to be dancing. Sarah-Jane, a Twitter user from Australia, wrote: 'I'm so glad that Facebook made my 'Year in Review' image a picture of my now dead dog. I totally wanted to sob uncontrollably this Xmas Eve.' And Rosie from Haywards Heath wrote on Twitter how she had been confronted with her dead grandparents. The 31-year-old, who would only give her first name, told The Independent: 'My Year In Review came up with a photo I'd posted following my Nonna's unexpected passing recently. 'It struck me as ill-considered, because their algorithm clearly can't distinguish why an image has been used - deceased relative, missing child, images taken following accidents or assaults - all things I've seen posted on Facebook this year which are hardly things you want to remember.' Tech: A Facebook worker waits for friends to arrive outside Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California . Mr Meyer, a web designer, also had a nuanced critique of the potential pitfalls posed by Facebook's Year In Review, blaming it on the fact that 'algorithms are essentially thoughtless'. He added: 'Where the human aspect fell short, at least with Facebook, was in not providing a way to opt out. The Year in Review ad keeps coming up in my feed, rotating through different fun-and-fabulous backgrounds, as if celebrating a death, and there is no obvious way to stop it.' In a subsequent blog post however, Mr Meyer issued his own apology to Facebook and Mr Gheller, Year In Review's product manager, for singling them out for a problem which affects many other online services. 'I am very sorry that I dropped the Internet on [Mr Gheller's] head for Christmas. He and his team didn’t deserve it,' Mr Meyer wrote.","Users came face-to-face with dead children, grandparents and family pets .

"British driving licences are to feature the Union Jack as well as the current European Union flag under plans announced today. Ministers said the changes meant that UK motorists will be able to ‘fly the flag with pride’ on the photo-card element of their licence. The European Union flag alone has been displayed on full driving licences since photocards first came into use in July 1998. Scroll down for video . British driving licences will soon feature the Union Jack as well as the current European Union flag . More than 127 million photocard licences have been issued since they were introduced. But today transport minister Claire Perry is announcing that anyone applying for a new licence or changing their personal details will be issued with a licence showing both the British and European Union flags. The changes will apply to motorists in England, Scotland and Wales and provide road users ‘with a symbolic sign of their national identity’. Transport Minister Claire Perry said: ‘People in this country rightly take pride in our national flag which is why I am delighted it will now be displayed on British driving licences. Transport minister Claire Perry said the changes meant that UK motorists will be able to ‘fly the flag with pride’ on the photo-card element of their licence . 'Celebrating Britain strengthens our sense of national identity and our unity. I will feel proud to carry my new licence and I hope others will too.’ David Cameron announced two years ago that he wanted to see the UK flag on British photocard licences. But the final go-ahead was postponed until after the referendum on Scottish independence. Ministers feel that the driving licence is, alongside the passport, the single most widely used identity document in the UK and that it is an anomaly that the card is dominated by an EU flag. They are using an upgrade to the licences - which will now include a microchip - as an opportunity to change its design. An EU directive passed in 2006 requires the EU flag to be on the driving licence as part of the single market, but permits other symbols to be on the card. In 1996, the Conservative government was planning to put the union flag and the crest on the then-new plastic card driving licences that were shortly to be introduced. However, the Labour government that came in a year later reversed this decision, and the new plastic licences, first issued in 1998, had no union flag or royal crest. One reason was that there was doubt that Catholic drivers in Northern Ireland would tolerate the union flag on their driving licence – and it still seems that no symbol will be placed on cards issued in Northern Ireland. Ministers say the inclusion of union flags on licences is ‘one of a number of improvements being made for motorists’. On 25 October this year, the DVLA announced a dramatic drop in licence fees for those who apply online. In the interests of reducing unnecessary red tape, since October 1 this year the paper tax disc is no more and motorists can pay their vehicle tax by direct debit. From June 8 next year the paper counterpart of the photocard licence will no longer be required. The DVLA has also introduced a service to allow the public to check the most up to date information on their driving record .","British driving licences will soon feature the Union Jack as well as EU flag .

"When Andy and Hazel Linton received a note telling them a letter was waiting at the sorting office, they were bewildered and worried. Fearing it could be some urgent test results from the doctor, they rushed to collect it, paying £1.53 for the privilege as it was sent without a stamp. It was, in fact, nothing more than a slightly underwhelming Christmas card ... from their local Lib Dem MP. Andy and Hazel Linton paid £1.53 for a letter that was waiting for them at the sorting office which turned out to be an underwhelming Christmas card from their local Lib Dem MP . The card had been sent without a stamp, which meant Mr and Mrs Linton had to fork over £1.53 for it . Mike Thornton – who won his seat less than two years ago when he replaced disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne – has now been dubbed 'Scrooge' by some of his constituents after they were forced to pay for their cards. The MP for Eastleigh, Hampshire, had hired an agency to send out 400 'personal' Christmas greetings to local party supporters. But some were mistakenly posted without stamps, meaning many people received a note from the postman instead. MP for Eastleigh, Hampshire, said he was 'very embarrassed by the blunder and investigating how it happened . Yesterday Mr Thornton, 62, was said to be 'very embarrassed' and was investigating how some of the stamps were forgotten. He insisted he would reimburse those who had been forced to shell out. Lib Dem activist Mr Linton, 60, who works at Southampton docks, was waiting to hear back from his doctor when he received the postman's note on Christmas Eve. He and his wife faced an anxious three-day wait before they could pick it up, and were horrified to find out they had faced so much stress just for a card from Mr Thornton. Featuring a child's drawing of Santa, the card had no personal message and the only word handwritten was the first name 'Mike'. Mr Linton said having to pay to pick it up was an 'insult', adding: 'It is a complete cock-up. 'MPs like to act like they have so much power and can change things but they can't even get a Christmas card right. It is unprofessional and does not bode well for him. He'll be seen as the Christmas Scrooge – he has shot himself in the foot. 'About 20 other people had turned up for similar envelopes at our sorting office – you have to ask, how many more were there across Eastleigh? I don't think he'll survive the election now.' Mrs Linton, 59, a care worker, said she had been sick with worry thinking the letter was medical results. 'I was really angry when it was just this Christmas card,' she said. Mr Thornton, a former mortgage broker who attended the exclusive Charterhouse School, won the Eastleigh seat in a by-election last year with a majority of 1,771. But a surge in votes for Ukip saw the Lib Dems' share of the vote fall by 14 per cent compared with 2010. A Lib Dem spokesman said Mr Thornton was 'very embarrassed' that some stamps were missing and was investigating the error. The MP, who is married to Peta, 54, with whom he has a 20-year-old daughter, Philippa, said last night: 'This is really unfortunate, these were personal cards paid for by myself and I will personally refund any costs incurred due to this.'

"A father allegedly tried to attack his daughter's uncle in court who was convicted of kidnapping, raping and killing the 12-year-old in 1999. Karl Roberts was facing a competency hearing Monday when Andi Brewer's father Greg Brewer allegedly tried to get to Roberts in the Polk County Circuit Court. He did not manage to attack the convicted murderer before he was tackled to the ground by Polk County Sheriff's Office deputies, according to a representative from the courthouse, reports KFSM. Karl Roberts (right) was facing a competency hearing Monday when Andi Brewer's father Greg Brewer (left) allegedly tried to attack Roberts in the Polk County Circuit Court . In 1999 Roberts, who was a relative by marriage, was sentenced to death row for killing Andi (pictured) In 1999 Roberts, who was a relative by marriage, was sentenced to death row for the murder in Hatfield. Andi was the daughter of Rebecca Petty, the Rogers Republican who won the state House District 94 seat in the November general elections. Petty told KFSM, that Brewer jumped the partition after Roberts looked back and said, 'Greg, it's all going to be okay.' 'I think he had just kind of had it,' Petty said. 'We're just overwhelmed right now.' In 1999 Roberts, who was a relative by marriage, was sentenced to death row for the murder in Hatfield . The gravestone of Andria Nichole Brewer - she was killed in May 1999 by her uncle . According to THV11, Brewer was reportedly so distraught and uncooperative that he was put into a cell to calm down before being booked in. Chief Deputy Sawyer said Greg Brewer's charges are pending. The competency evaluation was to determine if Roberts could waive his post-conviction rights, following his previous murder conviction. In a confession read to jurors during the trial, Roberts said that, after eating dinner at his in-laws' house in Hatfield, it occurred to him that his niece was home alone babysitting her younger siblings. He told police in the confession that his niece begged him several times to take her home, but, instead, he ordered her out of the truck in a densely wooded area and raped her, then choked her. During the trial a defense witness, Dr. Lee Archer, testified that Roberts knows right from wrong but cannot conform his behavior to the law. Archer told jurors that Roberts is missing a portion of the frontal lobe of his brain because he was struck by a gravel truck when he was 12. The frontal lobe enables people to understand consequences and reason, Archer said. Roberts was originally sentenced to die on May 24, 2000.","Karl Roberts was facing a competency hearing when Andi Brewer's father Greg Brewer allegedly tried to attack him .

"The first breakthrough drug for pancreatic cancer in 20 years will not be available on the NHS. Hundreds of patients with advanced disease will be denied Abraxane, which extends life by two months when there are virtually no other options. Campaigners said draft guidance by NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), the rationing watchdog for England, that the drug was not cost effective would leave patients in despair. Hundreds of patients with advanced forms of pancreatic cancer will be denied Abraxane, which extends life by two months when there are virtually no other options, after it was decided the drug is not cost effective . Ali Stunt, founder and CEO of the charity Pancreatic Cancer Action, said ‘We are outraged by the decision. ‘This is the first time Nice has looked at an effective treatment for the disease since 2001 and they have rejected it. ‘There is a real disparity between survival rates here, which have been unchanged for 40 years, and elsewhere in Europe where patients survive twice as long and this decision is a backward step.’ About 8,500 Britons are diagnosed annually with pancreatic cancer, which kills four in five sufferers within a year. Tumours are hard to detect because the pancreas is buried deep in the body so symptoms emerge when the disease is at an advanced stage. Pancreatic cancer claimed the lives of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and author Iain Banks, and was the disease which triggered the character Hayley Cropper in TV’s Coronation Street to kill herself. Pancreatic cancer claimed the lives of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs (pictured) and author Iain Banks . The drug is given as an intravenous injection costing £600 a week, with an average course of treatment costing £5,000. Trial data shows that Abraxane and chemotherapy increases average survival by two months, but also increases the number of patients alive after two years. Professor Will Steward, Professor of Medical Oncology in Leicester, said ‘This is very depressing news for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who already have very limited treatment options. ‘This negative Nice decision means that hundreds of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, who could potentially benefit from Abraxane, will not have access to it. ‘For a cancer which has such poor survival rates, this is a very sad decision by Nice and now leaves clinicians with limited treatment options.’ Abraxane is currently available through the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) in England, but could be axed as part of a cost-cutting review. Over 260 advanced pancreatic cancer patients have received it via the CDF since March. Mother of five Sandra Hukin, 54, who lives near Bedford with partner Roy, 50, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the end of August, after a short period of stomach symptoms. About 8,500 people in Britain are diagnosed annually with pancreatic cancer, which kills four in five sufferers within a year (Pictured is a cancer cell) Within a couple of weeks she was in excruciating pain and warned the cancer had spread to several sites in her body. She went on to Abraxane after her consultant at Bedford Hospital applied for funding and has felt well since. Ms Hukin, who was a nurse specialising in learning disability patients, says the drug meant she could enjoy Christmas with her family. ‘I’d been as fit as a fiddle until this summer, I’ve never had any call on the NHS until now and there is nothing else for someone like me. ‘It’s too distressing to imagine others will have to go without’ she added. London-based oncologist Dr Andrew Gaya said This is very disappointing news for both clinicians and patients. ‘A two month survival benefit in pancreatic cancer is actually extremely significant given the average survival for metastatic patients of 6 - 8 months. ‘If this negative review is upheld it would be a backwards step for pancreas cancer patients in England.’ Ms Alex Ford, Chief Executive of Pancreatic Cancer UK charity, called on Nice to reconsider. She said ‘The Nice decision and the review by the CDF which could lead to Abraxane being removed from the CDF, is devastating news for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who currently have very few treatment options.’ Dr Adrian Kilcoyne, Medical Director, Celgene UK & Ireland which makes the drug, said ‘This decision is a serious setback for both clinicians and patients.’ Sir Andrew Dillon, NICE chief executive, said Abraxane was more effective than one of the treatment options currently available, but was also more expensive.","First drug for pancreatic cancer in 20 years won't be available on NHS .

"With an election ahead and the weight of expectation upon him, David Cameron needs all the support he can get ... and so did his knees yesterday. Panting, the Prime Minister wore support bandages on both legs – and, observers noted, perhaps a little extra padding of the natural variety elsewhere on his body too – as he got a soaking during a race along a swollen icy stream in the Cotswolds. Mr Cameron, 48, tackled the annual fund-raising competition, known as the Great Brook Run, close to his constituency home in Witney, Oxfordshire. With mud smeared on his face, David Cameron enjoyed a pint after crawling the icy water to get under a low bridge during the charity fun run . The Prime Minister gave a thumbs up to photographers as he crawled through the tunnel . The Prime Minister wore knee pads to prevent a repeat of the cut he sustained in the Great Brook Run in Chadlington in 2012 . With mud smeared on his face, Mr Cameron came close to losing his footing as he ran through the stream . The cross-country event is raced for half its mile length in the stream itself close to the village of Chadlington. Perhaps it was just as well he took extra precautions yesterday as, face smeared with mud, he crawled under a bridge and stumbled through the water, almost losing his footing at one point. But at least there was little danger of cuts – to Mr Cameron’s knees, that is, thanks to the extra layer protecting them. A Downing Street source said: ‘He took the precaution of using the knee supports this year for protection from sharp stones submerged in the water.’ The race is held every year in the Cotswold village during the Christmas break as a chance to run off the excess of the festive season . Every competitor gets a medal for taking part in the race, which has the slogan: ‘Run. Get Wet. Have a Pint’ Mr Cameron's wife Samantha stayed warm and dry in a grey winter coat and matching scarf . The run’s safety manual warns: ‘The brook is cold, parts of it are up to 3ft deep. There are many hidden rocks and tree roots which can be a trip hazard.’ Despite looking a little breathless at times, Mr Cameron completed the course. He finished 64th out of 141 runners, with a time of 14 minutes, 12 seconds, organiser Adam Engberg said last night from the Tite Inn in Chadlington, where many competitors recuperate after the run. Mr Cameron was congratulated by his wife Samantha, who stayed warm and dry in a grey winter coat and scarf while watching the race, as he enjoyed a refreshing pint of beer. She was on hand for moral support after the race's conclusion, with spectators looking on . Mr Cameron lined up with other runners this morning, after taking part previously in 2012 and 2009 . The Great Brook Run, which was first held in 2006, starts and ends at the Tite Inn in Chadlington and aims to raise funds for local good causes . The race, which raises money for the local primary school and costs £5 to enter, was first run in 2006. Organisers say that every runner ‘no matter how c**p’ gets a medal. In 2008, the first year Mr Cameron competed, he finished 25th out of more than 100 competitors – and did not wear a support bandage on either knee. In 2009, his knees were unsupported too. But at his next appearance in the event in 2012 he wore a support bandage on his right knee and finished 46th out of a field of 109 (a few places behind a man dressed as Father Christmas) with a time of 18 minutes, 23 seconds.","Prime Minister took part in Great Brook Run in village of Chadlington .

"The teenager out spear fishing with tragic Jay Muscat who died after being attacked by a four to five-metre-long great white shark fired a spear gun into the mouth of the shark to save his own life after it had mauled his friend. Matt Pullella was with Mr Muscat, 17, when he was attacked on Monday at Cheynes Beach on the West Australian coast, around 70km east of Albany. After fatally biting Mr Muscat the shark went for Mr Pullella who was able to fend it off by putting the spear gun into its mouth and firing the trigger. The Western Australian reported that Mr Pullella told friends on Facebook of the terrifying moment he faced death. 'The shark hit me first then attacked Jay,' he wrote. 'The shark turned and came for me, I pushed the spear gun down its throat and fired the gun! This is something no one should ever have to see.' Jay Muscat was spearfishing when he was attacked by the shark at Cheynes Beach on the West Australian coast . The shark is believed to have been injured during the attack when Mr Pullella fired the spear at it. 'They had been spearfishing and it's our understanding they had already captured some fish,' Rick Fletcher, a Department of Fisheries spokesperson, said. 'It appears the shark swam past one diver and bit the other on the leg. 'At this stage it's highly likely that if we capture the shark that's likely to have been involved in the incident it will be destroyed.' Western Australia's Department of Fisheries also confirmed on Tuesday that capture gear and baited drum lines have been deployed in the area in an attempt to catch the shark, which was likely to be a four to five-metre-long great white. The area where Mr Muscat was killed is a popular spot for sharks this time of year. A great white was spotted circling just off these waters two months ago. Mr Muscat described himself on his Instagram page as 'just a young salty dog ... spearfishing and fishing are my thing’. Mr Muscat also enjoyed sport and had been captain of Albany Senior High School volleyball team during this year’s Country Week sporting competition. Bryce Aggiss, who identified himself as Mr Muscat's best friend, wrote on Facebook that he 'lived life to the fullest ... this guy was always the life of the party and one of the greatest guys to be around'. Mr Aggiss said that he had been out on his boat reading to his Dad stories that were popping up on Facebook about someone who had been killed by a shark. He did not think anything of it and went home. That night he was woken by his family to be told that it was his best friend who had died. Scroll down for video . Mr Muscat, 17,  died after being attacked by what authorities believe was a four to five-metre-long great white shark . The beach has been closed as police investigate the incident and a WA Department of Fisheries spokeswoman confirmed that drum lines have been deployed in the area in an attempt to catch the shark . 'I can only think about how much I loved this guy, from admiring the zero amount of f*** he gave about anything, living his life to the fullest and never letting anyone tell him what to do, him wearing his hawthorn shirt everywhere, his love for the water and fishing and where his heart was at most, spearing fishing [sic],' he wrote on Facebook. 'I love you so much Jay and I'll never forget you bro, I don't know how I'll get over this man or who I'll go fishing with or just be around all the time. 'I love you so f***ing much and I'll miss you for the rest of my life, rest in peace brother.' The Facebook post got 824 likes with other posts saying: 'Jay R.I.P.' and ' Such a tragic thing for friends and family'. The 17-year-old is the second Australian teen killed while spearfishing this month, following the death of Daniel Smith, 18, at Port Douglas in far north Queensland. Iain Suthers, a professor in marine science from the Sydney Institute of Marine Science told Daily Mail Australia that spear fishers carry a higher risk of being attacked by sharks. 'All spear fishers are a little more exposed to risk even though the risk is still entirely low,' Mr Suthers said. 'Sharks do not just forage for food purely by smell or by sound; they also have these little sensory organs distributed along their lateral lines and under their snout – ampullae of Lorenzini. 'These sense electrical stimuli in the water and if the fish it still shaking and trembling – in close range of the shark - it adds to the attraction that sharks feel. 'It's the old expression of blood in the water. The safest thing is to spear the fish and immediately go back to your boat and put it in a bucket so you don't have the smell of blood and trembling fish around you.' The 17-year-old is the second teen to be killed while spear fishing this month, following the death of 18-year-old Daniel Smith (pictured), at Port Douglas in far north Queensland. Iain Suthers, a professor from the Sydney Institute of Marine Science said that spear fishers carry a higher risk of being attacked by sharks . Department of Fisheries spokesperson Rick Fletcher said the great white shark could be injured as a spear was fired at it by Mr Muscat's friend Matt Pullella who he was fishing with . A nearby fisherman is believed to have then brought Mr Muscat's body to shore on a boat, shortly before police were contacted by someone claiming they found his body in the water. Cheynes Beach is home to a caravan park and surrounded by bushland. It is at maximum capacity, full of campers and families during the busy Christmas season. The Department of Fisheries said that beaches in the region are likely to remain closed on Tuesday and urged locals and holiday makers to stay out of the water. Remote: Cheynes Beach is home to a caravan park, is surrounded by bushland and is often the subject of day trips for families at this time of year . Map: The attack occurred around 70km south of Albany, in WA's south . A monster 4.1m great white was snared in fishing nets off Cheynes Beach in April. Shark expert Dr Jonathan Werry told Daily Mail Australia white sharks 'certainly' move in the Albany region. Larger species, such as whaler sharks, also live in the area, Dr Werry said. Australia has witnessed a number of shark attacks this year, some fatal. In September, British expat Paul Wilcox, 50, was killed in a shark attack in Byron Bay, at the eastern-most point of New South Wales. Sean Pollard, 23, from Bunbury, WA, lost an arm and both hands when he came under attack by a great white in October. Premier Colin Barnett's government trialled using baited drum lines to cull sharks earlier this year. The policy was hugely controversial and resulted in 170 sharks being killed. The Environmental Protection Agency sunk the policy in a ruling earlier this year. The government is still able to use drum lines if they are threat to beachgoers, Mr Barnett was quoted saying in September.

"The estranged father of Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin faces the prospect of never seeing his famous son again - and spends his time watching the former child star's films as he recovers from a debilitating stroke. Kit Culkin, 70, a former actor, suffered a stroke in January which left him unable to speak or use his writing hand. And speaking exclusively to DailyMail.com, Kit's step daughter, Thalia Baker Fuchs reveals how he is desperate to reconnect with his six children, but has to resort to watching movies they star in. She said: 'He tells stories about his kids, of course, like any father would. He’s proud of them.' Scroll down for video . Recovering: Kit Culkin and his longtime partner Jeanette Krylowski pictured in Arizona in March as he recovered from a debilitating stroke . Mac today: The former child star, looking scruffy and sporting long hair, at New York Comic Con in October . Mac then: Macaulay was an adorable child actor, whose classic film hits included Home Alone in 1990 . Thaila reveals the first photograph of the reclusive Kit in a decade, resting on a rock with his partner, Jeanette Krylowski, amid a field of cacti in Arizona. The 70-year-old former actor became estranged from his seven children over his split from their mother, Patricia Brentrup, in 1995 - and has not been a part of their lives since. Sad: Thalia Baker Fuchs said she hopes Kit Culkin will one day be reunited with his six children . The only way he gets to see his loved ones is by watching their movies and Thalia says Home Alone, which stars Macaulay as Kevin McCallister, a boy accidentally left at home when his family take a Christmas vacation to Paris, is still one of his favorites. She said:'He likes to watch his family’s movies, Home Alone comes on all the time, especially at Christmas, he watches that and Uncle Buck.' Kit has spent the past year recovering from a stroke. He has been plagued by bad health since the beginning of the year, when a piece of plaque from an artery in his neck broke off and traveled to his brain while he was cooking dinner at his home in Oregon. Thalia was the only one to fly up to be with him and help comfort her mother, who has been his partner for almost twenty years, and who is also suffering memory loss, thought to be the early stages of dementia. When asked if any of his children – Shane, 38, Macaulay, 34, Kieran, 32, Quinn, 30, Christian, 27 and Rory, 25 - had been in contact with her or made an effort to come and see their father, Thalia  shook her head sadly. She said: 'I don’t want to get involved in that part, it’s between Kit and his kids. I’m hoping that they’ll reconnect soon. 'You’d think that by now they would have their own eyes. Kit tells stories about his kids, of course, like any father would. He’s proud of them. 'I’m very family oriented, so it’s very hard for me to understand that side of things, I can’t comprehend it.'

The way they were: Macaulay Culkin as a child actor and dad Kit before they became estranged . Once a doting dad: Kit Culkin and a young Mac: They became estranged when Mac was caught in a bitter custody battle between Kit and his former wife Patricia.  Mac ended up divorcing his parents aged 14 . After he was discharged from hospital, Kit and Jeanette went to live with Thalia and her family in their modest home on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona while on the road to recovery. Thalia revealed: 'He’s had to learn everything all over again, like speaking and writing. He’s a big writer and he couldn't even grip a pen. 'He couldn't speak for a while or use his hand. 'For a little bit I felt all alone taking care of him and Jeanette, I was like, ‘What am I supposed to do? I have three kids, a husband, two dogs. And they have two dogs too.’ it was a lot to take in.' Speaking about Kit's kids, Thalia declared: 'All he did was make them a bunch of money, but it wasn’t even about the money. It was the custody battle and the mother being controlling.” While Thalia says she thinks a reconciliation will happen between Kit and at least some of his children, she is certain the last person to make up with his father will be Macaulay. 'Mac would be the last to reconcile with him,' she said. Macaulay was managed by his parents from the start of his career when he was just four until 1995 when they split and he 'retired', aged 14. Longtime love: Kit Culkin and his partner of 20 years Jeanette Krylowski . Family man: Kit Culkin - seen with a young Mac  - is estranged from all of his children . By that time he had earned an estimated $50 million, which had largely been put into a trust fund, with 15 per cent paid to his managers. A huge legal battle between Kit and Patricia ensued over both custody of Macaulay and his fortune, which ended up with him ‘divorcing’ his parents. After the bitter fight was over Kit, a highly charged character, appeared to accept defeat. While Patricia and his children stayed in New York, he retreated to the West Coast and started over again with Jeanette, who he had known since the 1970s. A former actor himself, Kit let his once dark hair go grey and long and complemented it with a large beard as he settled into small town life in Oregon, thousands of miles away from the bright spotlights and fast pace of New York. Thalia claims that Kit - known in the 1990s for his hard-nosed business tactics - is in fact, now humble, and quickly dismisses the question of whether his family helped with medical bills, saying: 'He’s not had a penny from his family, ever. He and Jeanette are retired so they’re on social security, and that’s it. They live like normal people. Father's footsteps: Kit Culkin (left) was an actor and his son took after him . On stage: Kit Culkin (far right) attends Elizabeth Taylor's  32nd birthday party in 1962 with the Hamlet cast . Thalia claims that one of the most heart-breaking things for Kit, who has made a good recovery, is not being in contact with his daughter, Quinn, following the death of his other daughter Dakota after she was struck by a car in 2008. She said: 'I know he really wants to speak to his daughter. He was heartbroken over Dakota.' She added the warning: 'Family is everything and he’s not going to be around forever. They’ll regret it when it’s too late.' When asked if Kit would appreciate Macaulay’s joke band, The Pizza Underground, Thalia thinks it unlikely, although she ‘likes’ the group herself on Facebook and finds them funny. She says she would even consider approaching Macaulay at one of his shows in an attempt to reunite him with his father. She said: 'The band, it was kinda funny and kind of stupid, maybe there’s a reason he did that, I don’t know. I would go and see them. I would probably introduce myself to him. Maybe I could persuade him [to get in contact with Kit], but I doubt it. Modest: Jeanette Krylowski's Oregon home. She has been by Kit Culkin's side for the past 20 years . 'Kit wouldn’t want to see them, he wouldn’t like that type of music. He doesn’t even like it when I put my music on in the car.' Admitting she may face the ire of the fiercely private Culkin family for speaking out, Thalia said she did not care as she was one of the few people to care for Kit. After a few months of recuperation, Kit left to stay with his sister, Die Hard actress Bonnie, 66, in California on his own, but Jeanette'“couldn’t handle being apart' from him so they rented a small house close to Bonnie’s so she could look after them and take them to medical appointments. Thalia added: 'Kit is 95 per cent better. He’s able to talk for the most part now. He can drive again and he can cook, which he loves to do. Famous: Macaulay Culkin remains most famous for his childhood role in Home Alone in 1990 . Spirited: Macaulay Culkin fights off Daniel Stern in Home Alone . 'Bonnie is wonderful, she’s really been a big help with him, doing therapy and getting him hooked up with doctors, him and Jeanette. 'I have the best relationship with them, Kit is basically my stepdad. They’ve always been really nice to me, that’s why I’ve never understood all the things people have said about Kit, he’s just a wonderful, kind, generous guy.' Kit’s recovery means he is now able to continue caring for Jeanette and they are hoping to return to normal life in Oregon. It has also given his family another chance to make amends and hopefully this Christmas he can have more of a connection to his most successful son than simply seeing him as he was 24 years ago in Home Alone.","Thalia Baker Fuchs's mom Jeanette Krylowski, is Kit Culkin's partner of 20 years .

"Over 1,000 pet cats that were stolen have been rescued in North China, after some of their upset owners managed to track down the kidnappers and work with police to get them back. The animals were to be sold for their fur and meat, police in Liaoning Province said, as eating cats is culturally accepted in some parts of the country, and considered a delicacy in others. Around 300 of the animals have already been returned to their homes after the major trafficking operation was foiled. Having noticed a spike in cats going missing in Dalian City, some of the owners joined together to try and solve what was happening.

It is unclear whether all the cats will be able to be returned to their owners, with authorities saying it will be difficult to track down homes for all of them. The Inquisitr reported that an estimated four million cats are eaten in China each year. While it is accepted in some areas, it is not common where the trafficking operation was busted, which might explain why the group targeted that spot. Feng Dongmei, a manager of cat and dog welfare at the Animals Asia Foundation (AAF), said that younger generations are becoming against the practice more and more, especially in Hong Kong, where eating cat meat is said to be based. 'In Guangzhou, cat meat is popular now mostly in restaurants on the outskirts of the city,' he said. 'Most of the cat eaters are older people and old habits die hard.'","Cats began going missing in Liaoning Province, China, earlier this month .

'My sister phoned and asked if I'd heard about Stuart, she had heard about it online. He had been hit by a taxi.' Having heard the news, Karl called round all the hospitals in the region to find out where his son was being treated. He said that Stuart remains in an induced coma at the Halifax Health-Medical Centre having had surgery for a blood clot in his brain. His mother Angela has said her son was 'critical but stable' and Stuart's sister has joined him at his bedside in a Florida hospital.

"Whatever your spending has been over Christmas many Australians will have had an even higher price to pay because they have lost or misplaced their credit cards. With the Boxing Day sales still in full swing and New Year’s Eve just around the corner, research from Commonwealth Bank has revealed that nearly one million credit cards may be reported lost or stolen over the festive season. From their research it was revealed that 957,414 per credit cards will be reported lost or stolen this Christmas. Research shows that nearly one million credit cards will be reported lost or stolen at Christmas . More than half a million cards will be needlessly cancelled over the festive season . The study has shown that whether just out shopping in the sales or celebrating the New Year, the vast majority (61 per cent) of cancelled credit cards will simply be misplaced. In all 6,976,865 cancelled credit cards are recoverable or later turn up each year. This averages out at 581,405 per month. It means that more than half a million cards will be needlessly cancelled over the festive season, with Australians wasting around 400,000 festive hours updating the details of cancelled credit cards.

"Steven Banford, 21, from Birmingham (pictured), has been jailed for four months after breaching a two-year Anti-Social Behaviour Injunction (ASBI) A stone-throwing racist neighbour from hell has been jailed after repeatedly terrorising residents until they were too scared to leave their own homes. Steven Banford was initially slapped with a two-year Anti-Social Behaviour Injunction (ASBI) after a campaign of abuse and intimidation that included throwing stones at residents as well as verbal and racial abuse. The 21-year-old, from the Kings Heath area of Birmingham, was first jailed for breaching the ASBI in March, but has now been sentenced to four months in prison for four more breaches of the order. The thug was served the ASBI at Birmingham County Court 12 months ago after his frightened neighbours anonymously gave evidence about his nuisance behaviour. Some told the court how they had even refused to leave their homes or use the shops as a result of Banford's relentless abuse. The order, which runs until December 6 next year, banned him from entering areas of Yardley Wood in Birmingham, and prevented him from causing nuisance or annoyance. He was handed the order alongside 20-year-old Mark Mottram. Banford denied the latest four breaches of the order but was found guilty based on the evidence of a resident and three police officers. Councillor James McKay, cabinet member for social cohesion, equalities and community safety at Birmingham City Council, said: 'I hope that this prison sentence delivers a clear message to other individuals that Anti-Social Behaviour Injunctions are a serious matter. 'If they are breached, offenders risk being caught and serving a prison sentence. 'I congratulate the resident and officers involved with this case for their hard work and courage.' Banford was jailed in March for breaching the order and has now been sent to prison again for four more breaches. The order bans him from entering a specific area (top right) and 'causing nuisance or annoyance' Inspector Darren Henstock, of West Midlands Police, added: 'This is a great result and shows the hard work between us, local residents and the council in bringing those who are intent on causing misery to their local community to justice. 'It also reminds offenders that prison awaits those who blatantly disregard injunctions placed upon them. 'We continue to work closely with the community and partners to restore confidence and safety.' One of Banford's neighbours in Allenscroft Road, Kings Heath, said: 'He was simply awful. The fear he caused made everyone's lives miserable. 'Everyone is glad he has been jailed but it only gives us a four-month break. We'd love him to be sent away for years instead of months.' Banford was handed an Anti-Social Behaviour Injunction alongside Mark Mottram, 20 (pictured) An Anti-Social Behaviour Injunction (ASBI) is an order that prohibits the person in respect of whom it is granted from engaging in housing-related anti-social conduct. The order is similar to an Anti-Social Behaviour Order (ASBO) but has been developed to help councils and housing associations tackle anti-social behaviour in social housing areas. An injunction can be granted against a person aged 10 or over if two conditions are met: . (i) the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the person has engaged or threatens to engage in anti-social behaviour; and . (ii) the court considers it just and convenient to grant the injunction to prevent the person engaging in anti-social behaviour. The order can be used in a wider range of circumstances such as anti-social behaviour against hospital staff, shop staff, and  neighbours in the  rented sector. An injunction is granted for a specific period of time, will name the person responsible for supervising compliance with the injunction and can include a power of arrest if breached. The injunction will require the person who is committing anti-social behaviour to comply with rules such as not entering a specific zone, or not causing nuisance to residents. They are issued by the County Court and can range from six months to two years in length. An injunction can be applied for by the police, a local authority, a housing provider, the British Transport Police Force, Transport for London, the Environment Agency or the NHS Business Services Authority.","Steven Banford given two-year Anti-Social Behaviour Injunction last year .

Rodeo cowboy legend Alvin Nelson pictured left in 1934 and recent times seen right . Nelson won the saddle bronc world championship in 1957 at Madison Square Garden in New York. He qualified for five Wrangler National Finals Rodeos, winning the saddle bronc riding average at the finals in 1961 and 1962, and also the all-around title in 1961 in Dallas. Nelson told the Minot Daily News in 2004 that he remembered his 1957 title well. 'The rodeo lasted three weeks in September, and at that time, it was the world's largest rodeo according to prize money, number of spectators and the number of contestants,' he said as he was preparing to be inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame. 'There were eight rounds. I split third and fourth on the first horse, won the second round, split first and second in the last two rounds to win $4,234,' he said. 'This was the most money ever won in the saddle bronc riding at any one rodeo at the time, and this record stood until 1980.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

"Dramatic falls in the global oil price in recent weeks would have created a £15.5billion financial blackhole for an independent Scotland, it was claimed today. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said the Scottish Government's oil revenue forecast for the first three years of independence would have been plunged into turmoil. He claimed the latest UK Government analysis showed that 100 days after the referendum, an independent Scotland would have been facing the shortfall following a drop in oil prices. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael claimed the latest UK Government analysis showed that 100 days after the referendum, an independent Scotland would have been facing the shortfall following a drop in oil prices . The value of North Sea oil reserves played a major role in the campaign for independence, which ended in voters rejecting the idea of going it alone in September's referendum. Mr Carmichael said 'serious questions' now needed to be asked about how the SNP administration 'got this so badly wrong'. UK Government figures claim that the current falling price of oil would have provided £4.7 billion for an independent Scotland between 2016-17 and 2018-19. This is in contrast to Scottish Government predictions of £20.2 billion being generated over the same period. Mr Carmichael said: 'On referendum day, Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney were predicting 'a second oil boom'. 'Scottish Government economists were telling us the oil price would be 110 US dollars (£70) per barrel. 'Now, just 100 days later, with the oil price actually standing at 60 US dollars (£38), there is a £15.5 billion hole in the finances of independence. 'That is a £155 million mistake for every day that has passed since the referendum on September 18.' The value of North Sea oil reserves played a major role in the campaign for independence, with Prime Minister David Cameron visiting the BP Eastern Trough Area Project (ETAP) oil platform in the North Sea, around 100 miles east of Aberdeen in February . 'Serious questions need to be asked about how they could have got this so badly wrong on this vital referendum issue. 'We were making a decision that Scots were going to have to live with forever and the Scottish Government are sticking to wildly optimistic oil predictions that have not even made it to the new year.' A spokesman for Deputy First Minister John Swinney accused Mr Carmichael of 'staggering hypocrisy' Mr Carmichael said it was 'totally unacceptable' and said the Scottish Government needs to take steps to 'restore confidence' in any future oil analysis. He said: 'At the same time, we are continuing to work closely with industry leaders to address the challenges it faces and to maintain Britain's energy security by maximising the economic recovery of our domestic oil and gas resources. 'The package of allowances and tax reliefs the UK Government unveiled as part of the Autumn Statement were the result of the close and productive working relationship with the oil and gas sector in this country - a level of support which is only possible because we can draw on the combined strength and resources of the United Kingdom.' However, the Scottish government hit back, accusing Mr Carmichael of 'staggering hypocrisy' and claiming the Westminster government had massively over-estimated the price of oil in recent forecasts. A spokesman for Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: 'Instead of, bizarrely, gloating over his own Government's lower than expected revenues, Mr Carmichael should be doing all he should to help the industry, which has too often been subject to wildly fluctuating taxation from successive Westminster governments. 'Oil is a bonus, not the basis of Scotland's economy, and will be a fantastic asset for Scotland for decades to come, with as much in value still to come as has already be extracted. And most independent forecasts expect the price to rise again next year, with Opec predicting a price of 110 US dollars per barrel for the rest of the decade and around 100 US dollars in real terms in the long run. 'Current prices are nothing new - in 1999 they were around 10 US dollars a barrel, and Norway had only just started to invest in its oil fund, which is now worth more than £500 billion and is the biggest sovereign wealth fund in the world.'","Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael says SNP has questions to answer .

"An Islamic State propaganda magazine has lavished Sydney cafe gunman Man Haron Monis with praise for the siege, labelling the hostage crisis a 'daring raid'. It's also reissued a call for lone wolf attacks in Australia and taunted Western helplessness in the face of the threat. Monis and two of his hostages, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, were killed in the bloody conclusion to the siege in the early hours of December 16. Scroll down for video . Gunman: Man Haron Monis was killed during the siege's violent conclusion in the early hours of December 16 . Gunned down: A spray of police bullets killed Man Haron Monis on December 16 . In the foreword to its sixth edition, the IS magazine Dabiq described Monis as a brother and said he was fighting in the path of Allah. He did so 'by acting alone and striking the kuffar (non-believers) where it would hurt them most - in their own lands and on the very streets that they presumptively walk in safety,' the magazine states. 'It didn't take much; he got hold of a gun and stormed a cafe taking everyone inside hostage. 'Yet in doing so, he prompted mass panic, brought terror to the entire nation ... The blessings in his efforts were apparent from the very outset.' At the start of the siege, a black flag with Arabic writing was visible in a window of the Lindt cafe in Sydney's Martin Place. Dabiq declared this was 'a testament to his sincerity'. Terror on the streets of Sydney: Lindt cafe worker Jieun Bae was the terrified face of the Sydney siege . It said Monis joined other Muslims who answered a jihadist call 'to strike those waging war against the Islamic State wherever they may be'. In October, Dabiq published calls for lone wolf attacks across western nations, especially US, UK, France, Australia and Germany. It repeated that statement in the latest edition. 'There will be others who follow the examples set by Man Haron Monis and Numan Haider in Australia,' it said. Melbourne teenager Haider was shot dead after stabbing two police officers. 'All that the West will be able to do is to anxiously await the next round of slaughter and then issue the same tired, cliche statements in condemnation of it when it occurs.' A week ago Prime Minister Tony Abbott warned there had been a heightened level of 'terrorist chatter' in the aftermath of the Sydney siege tragedy. However, Australia's terror threat level hasn't been lifted - remaining at high, which means an attack is likely.","The Islamic State's Dabiq propaganda magazine praised Man Haron Monis for 'daring' raid .

"With Russia's economy shrinking for the first time in five years amid an onslaught of Western sanctions, you would expect its citizens to be holding back on needless expenditure. But, as these Instagram images show, some Russians have been splashing their roubles on caviar, posting pictures of the delicacy online. Despite the country's financial woes, many have uploaded the photographs with the hashtag '#какойкризи' - which translates as '#whatcrisis'. Despite Russia's economy shrinking for the first time in five years, wealthy Russians posted pictures of caviar online with the #whatcrisis .

Several photographs also include the the hashtag '#падениерубля' - meaning 'fall of the rouble' - after the value of the nation's currency plummeted once again. While red caviar, made from salmon roe, is associated with luxury and wealth, it is less costly in Russia because of the vast harvest of the fish off the country's eastern coast. Despite this, after today's announcement that the country's gross domestic product had fallen for the first time since 2009, many Russians would be expected to be striking caviar off their shopping lists. Sliding oil prices and Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine have continued to take their toll on Russia, whose wealthier citizens have started to move their money abroad.

Sliding oil prices and Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine have continued to take their toll on Russia, but not this Instagram user . Plummeting: How the value of the rouble has fallen against the pound in the last year . Many Russian companies and banks have been locked out of Western capital markets following the sanctions imposed on the country for its involvement in annexing Crimea. Inflation is also growing rapidly. Amid the rouble's collapse earlier this month, Russia's central bank raised interest rates to 17 percent from 10.5 percent to prop up the currency. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov warned last week that the economy could shrink 4 per cent next year based on oil prices of around $60 a barrel - their lowest level for many years. In a response to the emerging crisis, Russian President Vladimir Putin last week placed a cap on the price of vodka in an attempt to boost morale and stop citizens from making their own bootleg booze. According to a study by leading international universities last year, a quarter of all Russian men die before they reach their mid-fifties, and their love of alcohol - particularly vodka - is partly to blame.","Russia's economy shrunk for first time in 5 years after Western sanctions .

'They're asking for a donation. People tend to give them a couple of dollars, five dollars or ten,' Chris said. The fake monks force gold tokens into people's hands that read 'Work Smoothly Lifetime Peace' 'They're actually wanting up to $50, $75.' Chris said they could also get forceful with people. 'Some can become quite aggressive. When I took a photo of one he tried to get my phone and threw a few punches. He didn't connect,' he told A Current Affair. But Chris is not alone. People took to social media to express their outrage at these people who were impersonating monks and duping Australians out of their hard earned money. 'We were approached on Southbank on Saturday in Melbourne. He told us to write our name on a piece of paper then the word 'peace'. He asked for 50.00. We gave him 2.00. This is terrible. These frauds needs to be stopped,' one woman wrote on Facebook. New South Wales Minister for Fair Trading Matthew Mason-Cox (right) warned generous Australians, like Chris (left), to stop handing over their money . While another said: 'I am glad we only parted with $10. He [the monk] tried to take the $20 note we had. And here I was thinking I was doing a good deed. Very disappointed, I could of given that money to someone who deserved it.' NSW Minister for Fair Trade Matthew Mason-Cox has condemned the fake monks' behaviour, labelling the activity as a 'scam'. 'It's difficult because these people are always on the move. The reality is we need to get them when they're out there on the street. The best thing people can do is not give them money,' he told A Current Affair. 'It is a breach of the charities law for them to be on the street canvassing for charities because they aren't licensed.' Mr Mason-Cox added the impostors may also be breaking consumer law with their misleading and deceptive conduct. The Federation of Australian Buddhist Councils has echoed the minister's sentiments. 'In no way do we condone ordained people, a monk or nun, wandering the streets collecting money,' the federation said in a statement to the program.","The fake monks present gold tokens or blessings and then demand money .
In some cases, they are getting up to $75 off unknowing Australians .

"Dramatic cellphone footage captures the moment a three-year-old boy jumped from the second story of a burning building into the arms of his rescuer on Christmas Day. The child jumped into the man's arms while his hysterical mother watched on in terror as the blaze tore through an apartment complex in Birmingham, Alabama. Encouraging the boy named 'John' to take a leap of faith, bystanders are heard screaming out to to him to jump and manage to catch him while the fire burns around them all. Jump! Neighbors implore the 3-year-old boy to leap from the second-story window of his blazing apartment . Caught: The boy suddenly leaps into the arms of his neighbor and hands him back to his grateful mother . The three-alarm fire broke out at around 2am Christmas Day at Valley Brook apartments on Gallant Drive in the Center Point section of Birmingham. Kerry Jackson said he was awakened by his wife telling him that she could hear smoke detectors blaring. Jackson grabbed his camera and ran with his wife to help tenants trapped inside upstairs apartments, among them the 3-year-old boy. 'I really didn't have an emotion running through me at the time. It was just like I need him, we need him to jump,' said Jackson, who recorded the successful rescue. Out of harm's way: A firefighter is pictured running out  of the burning building with a little boy in his arms . Terrified: People had persuade this little boy to jump down to safety from the burning home . It was Jackson's cousin who caught the little boy and he told MyFoxPhilly that everyone did what they had to. 'One of the children didn’t want to jump. We had to actually pressure him to jump,' Jackson recalled. 'People's lives were in danger, people screaming. Everybody in community came together to help one another,' Jackson explained. Jackson said that after the boy was rescued firefighters arrived and discovered another child was trapped. Raging: The fire tore through the Birmingham, Alabama property on Christmas Day after a fire started in the oven . Devastated: The remnants of the home the morning of the 26th of December show the damage done by the fire . That child was also rescued from a downstairs unit and Jackson said that the reason he filmed was because as a photographer it is his instinct. ""Every time you watch it, there he go he jumped, he jumped, he finally jumped. It's just that feeling it gives you just to relive that moment and say you saved someones life. It's just a really good feeling,"" said Jackson. “Everybody in the community came together and helped,” Jackson said of the fire. Two adults and four children were injured – including the little boy in the video, who remains in the intensive care unit. The fire was caused by food left unattended on a stove, officials said to Fox.","Child named 'John' was caught by neighbors and the moment was filmed .

"Week-old baby Zahra sticks her tongue out for the cameras . She's just a week old, but she's already six feet tall. And Chester Zoo's new giraffe, baby Zahra, stepped out in public for the first time today - and even cheekily stuck her tongue out for the cameras. Zahra, which means 'flower' in Swahili, is the adorable Rothschild's giraffe who made her debut at the zoo this month. She was born to parents Aiofe and Meru, on 22 December and is their second baby. Curator of mammals at Chester Zoo, Tim Rowlands, said: 'Giraffes give birth standing up and the calves fall about 6ft - so they really do come down to Earth with a bump. 'But we're happy to report that our new, not-so-little, youngster is doing well and is already confident on her long legs. 'Everyone at the zoo is thrilled with Zahra and she has really added to our Christmas and New Year celebrations.' The zoo now has a herd of eight Rothschild's giraffes, which are classed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Current population estimates suggest there are less than 1,100 remaining in the wild. Mr Rowlands added: 'Whilst it's great that we have a nice herd here, in the wild this species really is under threat. 'Numbers are declining at a worrying rate due to a massive upsurge in poaching for their meat. 'So when people come here and see the likes of Zahra and see what magnificent animals Rothschild's giraffes are, we really want them to stop and think about the plight of the species in the wild. The rare Rothschild's giraffe, who stands at 6ft tall, is already confident on her long legs, said Tim Rowlands, the curator of mammals at Chester Zoo . 'Rothschild's giraffes are of high conservation priority and the need for a concerted conservation effort has never been more urgent.' On top of its successful breeding record, Chester Zoo has supported important projects in the wild, including the first ever scientific review of the Rothschild's giraffe. Its aim is to develop a long-term conservation strategy for the species in Africa.","Chester Zoo's new Rothschild's giraffe was born on December 22 .

"The killer of an Oregon woman whose body was found in a hotel stairwell Friday is still at large, and  homicide investigators are enlisting the help of the public to uncover the details of her murder. On Friday morning, police were called to the DoubleTree hotel in Portland after the body of Ashley Benson, 24, was found in one of the hotel's stairwells, KATU reports. By Saturday, the woman's death was ruled a homicide. Found: On Friday, police found the body of Ashley Benson, (photographed), a 24-year-old mother in a hotel stairwell in Portland . Trafficking: Investigators recently revealed that Benson was a victim of sex trafficking (photographed, Benson holds her 5-year-old son) No details of Benson's death have been released, but investigators said in a news release Sunday that the mother-of-one was a victim of sex trafficking. Authorities say it is unclear whether that is directly related to Benson's death. Benson's mother told KATU that she went to the hotel looking for her daughter on Friday when she became worried after not being able to contact her. Benson was arrested in 2011 and charged with third-degree theft. Family members said they saw Benson on Christmas Day, 21 hours before she was found dead, KATU reports. Benson allegedly told her father that she was going to see a movie with friends Thursday. She never returned home. Christmas Day: Family members said they saw Benson on Christmas Day, 21 hours before she was found dead (here, Benson is seen hugging her son) Hotel: Benson's body was found in a stairwell at the DoubleTree hotel in Portland (photographed) Autopsy: Portland homicide detectives are still investigating the circumstances surrounding Benson's murder and have not released the cause of her death, which an autopsy determined Saturday . Michelle Bart, with the National Women’s Coalition Against Violence and Exploitation, said that when one is a victim of sex trafficking, contact with family is rare. She told KATU there is a difference between police labeling someone a prostitute and a victim of sex trafficking. 'A lot of the time in human trafficking cases, the victims are not able to live one place and they're not living apart from the criminal activity or their abusers,' she said. Portland homicide detectives are still investigating the circumstances surrounding Benson's murder and have not released the cause of her death, which an autopsy determined Saturday. Benson's family has set up a GoFundMe page in Benson's honor to raise donations to pay for the woman's funeral and to help care for her son. Friend: A longtime friend of Benson's, Karissa Sheaffer (right), described Benson as a generous person with a contagious laugh . In a Facebook comment, a man named Michael, who is identified on Facebook as Benson's father, describes Benson's son as a 5-year-old named Marlan. Michael wrote: 'My poor grandson is 5 and ready of his life when others celebrate Christmas (sic) Marlan will mourn his mother's death. I am thankful for a great Christmas Eve with her (sic) cause they will never be the same for me either now.' Since, her death, many have posted and made statements about the woman and her tragic death. A longtime friend of Benson's, Karissa Sheaffer, told Oregon Live that Benson was a generous person with a contagious laugh. Sheaffer said her heart aches for Benson's son who is left without a mother. 'She loved her son more than life itself and it always showed,' Sheaffer said.","The body of Ashley Benson, 24, was found in a hotel stairwell Friday and, days later, her killer is still at large .

"A mother has hit out at environment authorities after a huge wall was built in front of her home as part of a flood defence scheme. Zoe Hughes was left furious after the sea wall completely ruined the view  she used to enjoy from her kitchen window, which looked out over the pretty Loughor Estuary in South Wales. The 33-year-old claims the wall is bigger than that shown on plans and wants viewing panels inserted into the flood defence wall. Zoe Hughes is angry after flood defences she was assured would be no higher than her windowsills blocked out the sea view from her home in South Wales . Mrs Hughes says the view was one of the main reasons she and her husband bought their home on the Gower Peninsula, west of Swansea. But her view was wrecked earlier this year when Natural Resources Wales installed a sea wall to protect the area from flooding. She said: 'I burst into tears when I saw what they had done. I used to have uninterrupted views across the estuary, now it's a concrete wall.' Mrs Hughes and her husband attended 'drop-in sessions' to look at the plans when they were announced and insists the designs showed a wall which only came up to her windowsill. But she says the wall which has been built is actually much taller. Mrs Hughes has demanded glass viewing panels be built into the wall to restore her view of the estuary . She added: 'Had I known what I know now I would have objected to the plans.' Natural Resources Wales say the seawall is the same height as the planning consent and the designs were discussed with residents. But a spokesman admitted: 'The impact at Mrs Hughes's house may be more pronounced than for other properties as it is further out due to the large foundations of the existing seawall and house.' They said its £1.6 million scheme will protect 150 properties and that adding glass panels to sections of the wall would cost an extra £700,000.","Couple bought house because of beautiful views of Loughor Estuary .

"Tragedy: Shannon Zwanziger passed away in early December after contracting the flu . Three children have died in Minnesota from what health officials are warning parents is a particularly virulent strain of seasonal flu. Seven other children are currently being treated at the intensive care unit of the Children's Hospital in St. Paul. Worringly, the flu has proved fatal to children with no apparent underlying health problems and statistics from the Minnesota Department of Health have revealed that in some parts of the state up to 50 percent of students have been absent in December battling the illness. Dr. Pritish Tosh of the Mayo Clinic explained that even in healthy children, the virus can cause the body to battle itself, sending white blood cells flooding into the lungs to compensate and lead to fatal consequences. 'The virus can enter the blood stream and then the brain, creating severe respiratory symptoms including shortness of breath and a very high fever,' he said to ABC News. 'If the body's reaction to the virus is too vigorous, this can cause as much damage as the virus itself,' he said. Indeed, 17-year-old Shannon Zwanziger, a senior at Owatonna High School died at the Mayo Clinic in early December from the flu. Initially falling ill with a fever and sore throat, Shannon deteriorated at home and her heart stopped beating while she was in her mother's arms after being sick for one week. Scroll down for video . No health issues: According to Shannon's parents, she had no underlying health problems before she got the flu . Despite the paramedics and best efforts, she passed away. 'The dominant strain appears to be H3, which in previous seasons meant there were more hospitalizations, more deaths and more disease in general,' said Karen Martin, a state health epidemiologist to the Star Tribune. Earlier in the month the CDC sent an advisory to doctors noting that one component of this year's flu vaccine was only partially protective against the predominant flu virus, known as influenza A (H3N2), which has mutated since the current flu shots were made. CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said it takes four months to make a new flu vaccine even using newer cell-based technologies, too long to be helpful in the current flu season. Past seasons dominated by H3N2 strains of flu have been severe, and the worry is that without a good match in this year's flu shot, many people could be hospitalized or die from flu this year. Frieden encouraged people who have not been vaccinated to get a flu shot because it could still offer partial protection against the mutated H3N2 virus and good protection from other strains that might become predominant later this year. CDC testing shows the vaccine offers good protection from about half of the H3N2 flu strains circulating, as well as H1N1 and influenza B strains.","Seasonal virus has mutated and has swept Minnesota .

"AirAsia once boasted that its well-trained pilots would never lose a plane days after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared. The budget carrier was forced into a humiliating apology and withdrew its in-flight magazine in which the article appeared last year. The article sparked anger on social media after an AirAsia passenger posted a photograph of the text on Twitter last April, with some accusing the carrier of mocking the Malaysia Airlines tragedy. In comments that will appear particularly distasteful in light of the disappearance of one of its own planes, the last paragraph read: 'Pilot training in AirAsia is continuous and very thorough. 'Rest assured that your captain is well prepared to ensure your plane will never get lost.' Distasteful: AirAsia was forced into a humiliating apology after an article in its in-flight magazine boasted that it would never lose a plane days after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared. The article sparked anger on social media after AirAsia passenger Jimie Cheng posted this photograph of the text on Twitter last April . Inconsolable: Family members of passengers on board missing AirAsia flight QZ8501 cry at a waiting area in Juanda International Airport as they wait for news of the search and rescue operation . At the time, AirAsia Executive Chairman Kamarudin Meranun expressed 'deep regret and remorse,' saying the latest issue of 'travel 3Sixty' magazine was printed before MH370 disappeared March 8 while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. Mr Kamarudin said the article was a monthly aviation column prepared well in advance by a retired pilot, who had worked for both AirAsia and Malaysia Airlines. 'This is a truly difficult time for the nation and words cannot describe how I personally feel of this incident,' Mr Kamarudin said in a statement. 'It truly saddens me that this article was released at such an inopportune moment. Again, I repeatedly offer my sincere apologies for any discomfort this may have caused.' On the lookout: A Singapore Air Force serviceman looks for wreckage of missing AirAsia flight QZ8501 on board a C-130 aircraft after the jet went missing en route from Indonesia to Singapore . Mystery: The flight went missing from radar at 6.18am local time - six minutes after last communication with air traffic control - while travelling from Indonesia to Singapore with 162 people on board. Search planes spotted objects and two oily patches in the search area on Monday afternoon . AirAsia group CEO Tony Fernandes also echoed the apology. 'As soon as we were informed on Twitter, we withdrew. Once again, apologies. It has been a difficult time for all in the industry,' he tweeted. Mr Kamarudin said at the time that disciplinary action would be taken against the magazine's editorial team. The fate of the Malaysian airline remains a mystery several months after it vanished. It wasn't the first faux pas for AirAsia. On the day the plane went missing, Fernandes said on Twitter that the aircraft's radio had failed and that all were safe, but later deleted the tweet. A multinational search and rescue operation is underway after AirAsia Flight 8501 vanished in air space thick with storm clouds on its way from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore with 162 passengers and crew on board. Aircraft crews searching for the jetliner have seen oily spots and objects in the sea, but officials say it is too early to know whether either was connected to the plane.","Anger erupted after passenger posted picture of article in its in-flight mag .

"To successfully launch its payment service in the UK, Apple will need the backing of major retailers and banks across the country. But sources are claiming that talks with such firms and institutions are proving difficult. In particular, one major British bank is said to be 'uncomfortable' with how much personal and financial data Apple wants to collect about its customers. Reports claim that talks between Apple and one of Britain's biggest banks have 'proved tricky'. This could mean the release of Apple Pay in the UK is delayed. Alternatively, Apple may decide to launch without signing a deal with the unnamed institution. The service is expected to launch in the UK early next year . The service is expected to launch outside the US early next year, but the precise date has not been revealed. Reports in the Telegraph claim negotiations between the tech giant and at least one of the UK's biggest banks have 'proved tricky because of wrangling over the terms, including what data Apple will be able to access.' This wrangling could mean the release date is pushed back. Alternatively, Apple could decide to launch the service without signing a deal with the unnamed bank. Apple has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment. When it launched Apple Pay in the US earlier this year, the tech firm was tight-lipped about when the service would rollout to other regions. Apple Pay launched earlier this year and lets people with an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus pay for goods by tapping their handsets on NFC readers. It works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. Apple Pay is currently available in more than 220,000 shops, and 17 banks, in the US. Visa has already said it is working with Apple to bring the service to the UK next year. But a recent job listing inadvertently let slip the service is on its way to Europe, the Middle East, Asia, India and Africa. The listing, first spotted by iClarified, has since been taken down suggesting either the position has been filled, or Apple wasn't ready to make the announcement. Apple boss Tim Cook announced Apple Pay at the launch event for the firm's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September. The service launched in the US in October and is currently accepted by more than 220,000 retailers, and 17 banks in the country. Visa's Pedro Sousa announced shortly after the launch that it was working to bring Apple Pay to the UK 'early next year', but no specific details were given. The recent job listing bolstered Mr Sousa's comments Apple Pay may launch in the region within months. According to the listing: 'Apple Pay is a new and exciting area that is set to expand across Europe, Middle East, India and Africa. 'The new London-based Apple Pay team will work to drive the rollout of this technology by working with a variety of internal and external partners, as well as issuers, payment networks and merchants across Europe.' In particular, Apple is said to be looking for an intern to handle non-disclosure agreements and contracts with these partners. There was a related listing, posted in China, for an Apple Pay Site Reliability Engineer. According to a recent job listing, a new London-based Apple Pay team will work to drive the rollout of Apple Pay (pictured at its launch with Apple boss Tim Cook) by working with a variety of internal and external partners, as well as issuers, payment networks and merchants across Europe . However, the rollout may be gradual, especially in Europe, as Apple will need to get the approval of the European Union Council of Ministers, in addition to signing deals with multiple retailers and banks. The ministers recently recommended new rules for mobile payments. EU legislators said that any payment service must have 'strong customer authentication', and licences may be required for individual states. The rollout could equally be brought forward following news Samsung is looking to launch an Apple Pay rival. Sources said the tech giant is in talks with LoopPay. LoopPay (left) lets customers pay with their phones and tablets.

However, the rollout could equally be brought forward following the news earlier this month that Samsung is looking to launch an Apple Pay rival. Sources told Re/code that the South Korean tech giant is in talks with startup LoopPay to let people pay for goods using their phones. Samsung has previously allowed NFC payments on certain networks and with partners including Barclaycard, but if it teamed up with LoopPay, the service would be expanded more widely. LoopPay calls itself a ‘wallet solution’ that lets customers pay with their phones and tablets ‘virtually everywhere’. It consists of an app and a device, which is either a fob or a phone case. The LoopPay app securely stores all payment cards including credit, debit, loyalty and gift cards. These can be used to pay for shopping in 90% of shops and banks in the US. Customers simply tell the retailer which card they want to use before tapping the device on a reader.

"Steven Drake Jr., 29, has been jailed for posts allegedly inciting violence against police the same day two New York City officers were shot dead . A Facebook user from Pennsylvania has been jailed for posts allegedly inciting violence against police the same day two New York City officers were shot dead. According to the Observer-Reporter, Steven Drake Jr., 29, was arrested last Wednesday in McDonald. Among the profanity-laced comments he reportedly posted on December 20 were 'The police brought this on themselves! I say kill them all! Enough is enough.' He apparently wrote similar remarks on his social media page the following day. The statements came after Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley, 28, shot and killed New York City police officers Raphael Ramos and Wenjian Liu as they sat in their patrol car. The Maryland man then turned the gun on himself. Two hours before the incident, Brinsley had posted a picture of a gun on Instagram with the chilling message: 'I'm Putting Wings On Pigs Today. They Take 1 Of Ours... 'Let's Take 2 of Theirs #ShootThePolice #RIPErivGardner (sic) #RIPMikeBrown. This May Be My Final Post. I'm Putting Pigs In A Blanket.' Tragically, Baltimore police had tried to apprehend Brinsley by alerting the NYPD after his morning shooting - but by the time a wanted flyer was issued, his attack was already under way. Police in Pennsylvania received an anonymous tip off about Drake's 'aggressive' Facebook posts, along with screenshots shortly after the New York slayings. Apparently he said he 'often posts anti-police rhetoric' on his social media pages and was drunk while writing his latest commentary. The Midway resident now faces a preliminary hearing on January 6 with charges including terroristic threats and disorderly conduct. Online court records do not list an attorney for him. Police say Drake acknowledged making the posts, which also referenced the recent police killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City. Victims: Officers Rafael Ramos (left) and Wenjian Liu (right) were killed on December 20 in a brazen ambush .","Steven Drake Jr., 29, was arrested last Wednesday in McDonald .

The couple were first pictured earlier this month as they pushed a pram around Leeds town centre, above . Announcement: Miss Cunningham shared this photo, showing a pink sparkly ring on her engagement finger, with her 69,000 Twitter followers on Friday afternoon. The news was confirmed by her representative . The engagement, which was confirmed by a representative for Miss Cunningham, comes just weeks after the couple were first pictured in Leeds city centre. There have also been reports that Miss Cunningham is pregnant with Goy's child. Goy was sentenced to 21 months in prison in 2007 after admitting to a charge of GBH for attacking his then-girlfriend when he discovered another man in their bedroom. The 33-year-old, who was addicted to steroids at the time,  punched the woman so many times that she broke her jaw and cheek she suffered fractures, the Nottingham Post reported at the time. During the trial, the court heard that Goy also had a previous assault conviction after attacking another girlfriend in 2001. He was released in 2009 after his second conviction but was jailed again earlier this year  for driving related offences. A representative for Miss Cunningham told MailOnline that Goy has 'turned his life around' since leaving jail. He said: 'It’s important to stress that since leaving prison in 2009, Andy has taken every opportunity to turn his life around, and this is without doubt the happiest Josie has been in a very long time.' Mystery: Miss Cunningham, pictured with her boyfriend in Leeds (left) and this week (right), said that her daughter's father could either be a surgeon, her best friend's boyfriend or a man who posed as a footballer . Yesterday it emerged that Miss Cunningham had wrongly told one man that he was the father of her three-month-old daughter by sending him the wrong DNA result. Miss Cunningham asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father - and wrote the outcome in cards to be delivered in time for Christmas Day. But the mother-of-three, who has recently been photographed with new boyfriend Andrew Goy, mixed up the notes and sent the positive result to the wrong man. Miss Cunningham shared her blunder with her Twitter followers before comparing her life to an episode of EastEnders. She posted: 'What an absolute f*** up! Put the wrong DNA results in the wrong envelope then had to tell the guy who thought he was the father he wasn't!' She added: 'My life actually feels like an episode of Eastenders, Whys nothing simple!?!?' She had previously told the Daily Mirror that she thought the Christmas Day paternity test revelation would be a 'nice surprise' for her daughter's father. The wannabe model from Leeds, West Yorkshire, also claimed that she would change her mobile number and only the card being posted to Grace's father would contain her new one. At one point, the former glamour model thought the child's father could be Hull City captain Curtis Davis, but it was later revealed that she had been duped. The man, who she began sleeping with after meeting him at a Leicester hotel in April last year, had allegedly told her he was the £2.2million central defender. Blunder: The mother-of-three shared her paternity test mix-up on Twitter before comparing her life to an EastEnders episode. She shot to notoriety when she boasted about having a £4,800 NHS breast enlargement . Friends had warned her it might not be him but she still fell for it, even after searching for pictures of the real footballer on Google. Writing on Twitter at the time she said: 'I feel so dirty, ashamed and devastated. I've been completely manipulated by a man for 18 months pretending to be a Premiership footballer.' The other two contenders for the possible father include a surgeon she slept with whilst working as a £1,000-a-night prostitute and her best friend's boyfriend. She has split the cost of the £300 DNA test between two of the men, with the footballer impostor refusing to give a sample, and says if they aren't the father they will get their money back. Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. She later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. She made headlines again when she said she now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother-of-two later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. She made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It came after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. Josie, from Leeds, made headlines after having £4,800 breast enlargement surgery paid for by the NHS . As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont). 'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice. Earlier this month, the mother-of-two stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job. Josie had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. But, using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. The mother-of-two had earlier spoken of her devastation when doctors told her she was having a third boy. She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'. Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl.","Josie Cunningham is engaged to her new boyfriend, Andrew Goy .

"A thief stole a tablet computer from a charity shop – only to return it eight days later because he couldn't get it to work. Christopher Hooson took the £50 Android gadget from a window display but didn't know it needed more equipment to make it work properly. After failing to get it to do what he wanted, he tried to 'donate' it back to the store. Staff at the Jonny Kennedy charity shop in Whitley Bay recognised him from CCTV footage and called the police. A thief stole an Android tablet from a charity shop - only to return it eight days later as it didn't work.  Pictured is Eric Duffield of the Jonny Kennedy Charity shop in Whitley Bay that was robbed . Lynne Russell, prosecuting, said the offence happened on November 11. She said: 'The defendant went into the Jonny Kennedy charity shop on Park Avenue. Once in there, he removed a computer tablet, valued at £50, which  was in the window display. 'He put it in a carrier bag and left the shop. 'Eight days later, he returned to the same charity shop. He returned the stolen computer tablet. 'Because of CCTV, he was then identified by staff and arrested.' Ms Russell added: 'He was taken to the police station. He admitted taking the item. He said he saw it in the window and thought it would be cheap or free, as it was in a charity shop, so took it. 'He took it and realised it didn't work without further equipment, so returned it to the shop.' Hooson, of Sunderland, was representing himself in court. He said: 'I didn't intend to steal it. I forgot I had it in my bag, so I returned it when I noticed.' But District Judge Begley didn't accept Hooson's excuse and said: 'How do you walk out of a shop having put it in your bag and not notice?' Hooson replied: 'I know, it sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?' District Judge Begley said: 'That's not what happened, is it?' After hesitating, Hooson replied: 'No.' Christopher Hooson took the £50 Android gadget from a window display but didn't know it needed more equipment to make it work properly. After failing to get it to do what he wanted, he tried to 'donate' it back . Fining Hooson £75 for the offence, District Judge Begley said: 'It's not very nice to steal from a charity shop. 'At least some sense eventually returned to you and you returned the item. However, it is a particularly mean offence.' Hooson was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge. The shop was set-up in 2006 in honour of Jonny Kennedy, who died 10 years ago from the rare skin condition epidermolysis bullosa which causes the skin to blister and peel, and all proceeds go to fellow sufferers. Speaking after the case, Eric Duffield, charity co-founder and trustee, said: 'The judge was really good and seemed pretty angry. I was pleased he got more than just a small slap on the wrist.' The shop has been targeted by a number of thefts and break-ins in recent years. There have been more than 12 thefts and break-ins since 2009, including burglars grabbing more than £400 from the till and a string of shoplifters making off with everything from a Playstation 2 and 16 games to a leather jacket off a mannequin. It prompted Mr Duffield to install £4,000 of CCTV equipment.","Christopher Hooson took the £50 Android gadget from a window display .

"A gang of stinking skunks has been terrorizing an upscale California neighborhood, destroying lawns and spraying residents as they try to get the animals away from their posh homes. Homeowner Vince Matranga says he's trapped several skunks using eggs and peanut butter as bait  — and one neighbor has managed to capture more than 10 just in his Granite Bay property. 'When you think you catch them all then another wave of skunks come in,' Vince Matranga told CBS Sacramento. 'They're digging up my grass,' he added. 'They're looking for grubs and insects and making a big mess.'

Some homeowners captured several skunks (left) by baiting them with eggs and peanut butter (right) The upscale neighborhood is now home to dug up lawns like this one, thanks to the stinky skunks . Matrangas says the animals are fierce and won't back down from a fight. 'I got a little too close a few times and got sprayed…just threw those clothes away,' the frustrated resident told CBS Sacramento. And when Matranga manages to get rid of one skunk, it seems another is just around the corner. 'There's one here looking right at me,' he told CBS Sacramento. Brandt Jordan, of Spiderman Pest Control, told the station that the skunks are spreading out. 'Folsom, Granite Bay — a lot of outlying areas, Loomis,' he told CBS Sacramento. 'Anywhere where there's open pastures, we're getting calls for that.' Jordan says the invasion could be a result of California's dry summer followed by heavy rainfall, which greatly diminished food stocks for the animals. Animal control is picking up cages with the trapped skunks throughout this week.

"Jet2 is apologising to holidaymakers who were stranded aboard an aircraft for nearly four hours after it was diverted to a different airport in France due to a severe blizzard. The plane was flying British skiers from Manchester to Chambery in the French Alps but was forced to land in Lyon, nearly 60 miles from their destination, after circling over the mountain region. One of the passengers said there was an atmosphere of ‘near mutiny’ and ‘civil war’ among the angry tourists who were trapped on the diverted jet while they waited for a gate, and one of them even called a British Embassy official for help. Passengers were stranded on the plane for nearly four hours while Lyon's airport accepted diverted flights . It occurred on Saturday as Chambery was being walloped by wintry weather that forced all inbound flights to divert and outbound flights to be delayed or cancelled, leaving more than 2,000 travellers stranded. The Jet2 flight landed in Lyon at 3:30pm but passengers weren’t allowed to leave the aircraft until a gate opened up just after 7pm. as the airport was overwhelmed by diverted flights, in addition to scheduled arrivals and departures. Passenger Andrew McIntyre, from Bramhall, told the Manchester Evening News that he was allowed to leave the aircraft with his 12-year-old son, Jack, who has Type 1 diabetes, so he could receive medical care in the terminal. But he was forced to leave his wife and daughter on the plane as the situation grew worse. After Jet2 passengers were allowed to leave the plane they boarded buses and continued their journey . He said passengers and even the flight crew had no idea what was going on as they waited for updates from Lyon airport officials. Andrew told the newspaper: ‘The flight was full - the toilets were out of action, it was a lamentable situation. People had been hugely tolerant, but it just got to the stage where it was becoming like civil war, it was near mutiny on there. ‘A lawyer on the plane called a British Embassy asset to say we were being held hostage by Jet2. The embassy spoke to French airport authorities and they let everyone off. ‘People had been on the aircraft since 10.15am and then were locked on the plane at Lyon for nearly four hours. It was totally unacceptable."" The region was hit by heavy snowfall on Saturday as a severe blizzard created treacherous travel conditions . Jet2 apologised for the inconvenience and hired coaches to transport the passengers to Chambery, which was hit by heavy snowfall at the weekend. Airline spokeswoman Gaby O’Grady told MailOnline Travel that several airlines were affected by adverse weather conditions and forced to divert to Lyon. She said passengers were kept on the plane because the airport struggled to keep up with all of the arrivals. She said: ‘It wasn’t the ideal start to their holiday, but we can only apologise to the passengers. We did everything we could to get them on their way.’ A recent study by Which? Travel found that the Jet2 route from Chambery to Manchester experienced some of the lengthiest delays during the 12 months ending August 2014. The study analysed Civil Aviation Authority data on flight delays for nine of the busiest UK-operating airlines. It found that the Jet2 route was delayed on average 67 minutes.","Plane was flying from Manchester to Chambery but was diverted to Lyon .

"United Airlines is facing a backlash on Twitter over its handling of a complaint about a dog that a passenger claims was left on an airport apron for half an hour in the pouring rain. Passenger Barbara Galletly tweeted a photo of the pet dog – snapped through a plane window covered with raindrops – as it sat in a crate on the rain-soaked tarmac in Houston, Texas. The photo sparked outrage among those who were unhappy that that the dog had been left outside in the cold and many weren’t satisfied with the airline’s reply to her tweet. Passenger Barbara Galletly's photo of the dog sparked a backlash against United Airlines on Twitter . Australian pop singer Sia was one of the Twitter users who sent angry messages to United Airlines . In her tweet Ms Galletly wrote: 'Evil United Airlines leaves dog on rainy cold runway for more than half an hour despite alerts to staff.' A United Airlines employee responded, tweeting: ‘Thanks for telling us. The weather can change & may have been clear when PetSafe dropped off. They're the ones to call too.’ PetSafe is the airline’s ‘specially-designed programme’ for transporting animals that are not eligible to travel in the aircraft cabin. United Airlines was bombarded with angry messages after posting this response on Twitter . Australian pop singer Sia is vowing never to fly with United Airlines again due to the incident . A United Airlines spokesman told MailOnline Travel that the 'angle of the photo on Twitter doesn't adequately tell what happened'. He said: 'We checked several cameras and confirmed that our ramp employees in Houston never left the pet unattended after our PetSafe employees dropped the kennel off when we were ready to begin loading the aircraft for departure. 'As is our standard practice, our employees placed the pet kennel completely under the wing to protect the pet from the falling rain and onto the aircraft after completing the baggage loading.' As for the length of time the dog was on the tarmac, the spokesman said 'it could have been about half an hour', adding that the temperature was about 10C at the time. Animals are loaded onto aircraft last so they can be unloaded first thing when the plane lands, he added. Another unhappy user, Katie, said she would avoid flying with the Chicago-based airline in the future . The photo has been retweeted more than 1,000 times and the Chicago-based airline has been bombarded with messages from Twitter users who are vowing never to fly with them again. One of them was 'Chandelier' singer Sia, who wrote: ‘I will never fly @United again. Thanks @theregoesbabs for exposing their sh**** treatment of our beloved pets.’ Another user, Katie, added: ‘This is an intentional act that screams negligence. I have always flown United but will now do all I can to avoid your airline.’ In a direct response to United Airlines’ tweet, a user named Gerry Dee wrote: ‘No, once you were alerted to it, it’s all on you from there.’ Several Twitter users described it as a public relation disaster for United Airlines . Jason Vendel added: ‘No excuse. They are your contractor. Plus, she said staff was alerted. Just apologize and hope that dog is ok.’ Other users said it was a public relations disaster for the company. BK Chambers wrote: ‘Don’t understand how an airline in 2014 doesn’t know when a social media issue is about to break.’ A user name Karah added: ‘Award for worst use of Twitter today goes to United about concerns for a dog left on the tarmac in the rain.’","Passenger Barbara Galletly tweeted a photo of the dog in its crate .

"It is a war-torn country that has barely been out of the headlines for decades, but it seems Afghanistan is also experience a resurgence as an alternative tourist destinations. Despite the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advising against all travel or all but essential travel to the entire country, some adventure tour operators are offering trips to curious travellers. Specialist operator Wild Frontiers has seen bookings for group tours to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraqi Kurdistan double in the past year despite ongoing political turmoil in the troubled nations. Most tours begin in the capital Kabul, which is still scarred by war but experience a resurgence, with busy bazaars and new buildings being constructed at record rates . And adventure travel company Hinterland Travel reported 2014 as its busiest year yet for bookings to Afghanistan, according to the Guardian. The extreme trips are available to travellers with deep pockets, costing around £4,950 each for two weeks, excluding flights. Responsible Travel offers tours taking in the historic city and capital Kabul, Buddhist sites, mountain villages, lakes and ancient forts. Spectacular landscapes and verdant mountains can be explored on the specialist tours . Afghanistan's colourful mosques are among the historic buildings that can be seen in cities and towns across the country . Its website explains: 'Our Afghan Explorer tour takes you through the mountains and plains, following in the footsteps of Marco Polo. From Kabul and the foothills of the Hindu Kush, you will visit the extraordinary city of Herat, the famous mountain caves of Bamiyan, the breathtaking lakes at Band-e Amir, the historical northern towns of Mazar-e Sharif and Balkh as well as the famous Panjshir Valley.' The company adds: 'Afghanistan is undergoing tremendous change at the moment but for the vast majority of Afghans, daily life continues in much the same vein as it has for centuries and there will be ample opportunities to witness traditional lifestyles from farming and pottery-making to silk-weaving and daily prayer.' However, as a warning to travellers, Responsible Travel explains: 'It may sound obvious but anyone wishing to travel to Afghanistan must understand that in places tourist infrastructure is almost non-existent. Days can be long and hard, and the levels of services will not match those offered in more regular tourist locations. However, don’t let this put you off. In our opinion Afghanistan is simply the most fascinating country in the world.' An old fort, in the town of Gurian, west of Herat, shows the history that can be seen in Herat Province . Afghanistan police patrol the foothills of the mountains. The Foreign Office advises against travel to the troubled nation . The FCO advises against all travel to most regions in Afghanistan and all but essential travel to the country's heartland and the border with Iran. It warns: 'There is a high threat from terrorism and specific methods of attack are evolving and increasing in sophistication. There is a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country. '2014 has seen an increase in the number of attacks in Kabul. While the majority of the attacks have been against Afghan National Security Forces and ISAF, insurgents have stepped up their attacks against western civilian targets.' However, Jonny Bealby, founder of Wild Frontiers, told the Guardian: 'Our clients want to get behind the headlines and see for themselves. They are interested, well-read people who realise the media tends to focus on the bad.' Travellers booking the specialist tours wants to see he country behind the headlines, according to Wild Frontiers . Mr Bealby said that he believes FCO advice can be 'ambiguous, overcautious and outdated' with its advice in some instances and said he often seeks local advice from contacts on the situation in certain areas when planning trips. Afghan Logistics Tours also offers trips to the troubled country, promising: 'Our custom made tours lend themselves to such travelers who have only limited time to spare or just want to get a taste of Afghanistan en-route from other countries.'","Boom in tourism as travellers seek to go 'behind the headlines'

"The Northern Territory is renowned for throwing up some mind-boggling moments but when ranger Paul O'Neill heard birds making a racket inside the Nitmiluk National Park, he went to investigate. And what he found was one of those double-take moments, he looked as a large python wrapped itself around and began devouring a wallaby. The NT Parks and Wildlife ranger quickly began to document the amazing scene on camera as the snake began swallowing the marsupial. Amazing images of a python wrapped around and swallowing a wallaby in the Northern Territory . Ranger Paul O'Neill began documenting the moment while on his rounds in the Nitmiluk National Park . The Nitmiluk gorge site is some 30 kilometres from the heart of Katherine and 310 kilometres south of Darwin. In the photos, the snake is first seen wrapping itself tightly around the marsupial to suffocate it. It then unhinges its jaw and starts working its mouth around its prey. The mean feat is further exaggerated by the shape of wallaby's body jutting out while it is inside the snake's stomach. The python has all but devoured the marsupial - but park officials say it could take up to seven days before it is fully digested .

"A mysterious Chinese blogger has provoked a storm of speculation online over claims he predicted the disappearance of an AirAsia flight thirteen days before one vanished. In a series of posts which have gone viral, the man appears to warn that the airline would be targeted by a shadowy group he calls the 'Black Hand' which he claims brought down Malaysian Airlines flights MH17 and MH370 earlier this year. An AirAsia flight went missing yesterday with 162 people on board after losing contact en route from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore  in the third crisis for a Malaysian carrier this year. Since its disappearance, social media users have reacted with astonishment at the apparent prediction, while others claim the posts were probably just edited afterwards to make it look authentic. Scroll down for video . A Chinese blogger has provoked a storm of speculation online over claims he predicted the disappearance of an AirAsia flight two weeks before one of its Airbus A320s (like the one above) vanished yesterday . The apparent predictions have gone viral on social media and discussion forums such as Reddit (above), with some users expressing astonishment at the forewarning and others claiming it could be a hoax . In one comment on December 15, which has been loosely translated by a Reddit member, the blogger apparently warns: 'Black hand has hijacked and shot down MH370 and MH17. 'This has pretty much killed the sixth largest airline: Malaysian airline. 'Now the black hand are targeting AirAsia to ruin this airline cause (sic) it too belong to Malaysia. 'Given how powerful the black hand are I suggest that all Chinese thinking about travelling to avoid AirAisa, so that you don't disappear like those on MH370.' Black Hand is a term believed to be a metaphor for a covert organisation or a number of underground groups. One Reddit user suggests the translation should read 'International big black hand' which they say is more of a reference to a 'despicable international bully'. No Chinese nationals were on Flight 8501 when it disappeared. The blogger reportedly peppered social media with a total of 39 posts on the subject which have been viewed by more than 650,000 people. Mystery: The flight went missing from radar at 6.18am local time - six minutes after last communication with air traffic control - while travelling from Indonesia to Singapore with 162 people on board. Search planes spotted objects and two oily patches in the search area on Monday afternoon . An Indonesia Navy search and rescue crew looks for AirAsia QZ 8501 on a Maritime Patrol Navy Aircraft above Bangka-Belitung Islands in the Java Sea . When asked how he could make such a prediction - with one user calling him a 'conspiracy nut' - he reportedly replied: 'All you civilians get away (from the airline). 'You can still hide, all those that see the post can still save themselves.' Other reports suggested the blogger repeated his warning on December 16 and 17, adding: 'This is a major event in human life, we have to pay attention.' Despite facing continued accusations of being 'crazy', he relays a further message to 'be suspicious of the US,' writes one Reddit user who says he got a friend to translate the posts. The blogger later claims to have persuaded some people to follow his warning. But after December 17, there was no more activity on his account. Since the disappearance of Flight 8051, many have reacted with astonishment at the apparent prediction, with speculation rife that he was a Chinese intelligence official or a hacker who had obtained information from the group allegedly responsible. Inconsolable: Family members of passengers on board missing AirAsia flight QZ8501 cry at a waiting area in Juanda International Airport as they wait for news of the search and rescue operation . Family members of people on Air Asia flight QZ8501 pray together at Juanda International Airport . Reddit user lolrus_bukkit wrote: There is an ongoing conspiracy in Chinese forums that this guy is in Chinese intelligence or a hacker that got sensitive information trying to save as many people he could without making a big scene (guess he failed the second part).' Aviation mysteries like this often spark conspiracy theories as happened when MH370 disappeared over the Indian Ocean in March last year, with explanations ranging from the airliner being shot down to being abducted by aliens. Sceptics also argue that the original posts may have been edited with information about the AirAsia flight after it vanished to make it appear like a prediction. The Chinese version of the Epoch Times suggested the blogger called himself the 'Landlord' although some forum users claim this was a mistranslation. Dozens of planes and ships searching Indonesian waters for a missing AirAsia plane focused Monday on a patch of oil for possible clues as a senior official warned the aircraft was likely 'at the bottom of the sea'. Australia, Singapore and Malaysia joined the Indonesia-led search as anguished relatives awaited news of their loved ones more than a day after Flight QZ8501 disappeared. Indonesian Air Force spokesman Hadi Tjahjanto told AFP the search was now concentrated on an oil patch spotted off Belitung island, across from Kalimantan on Borneo island. 'We are making sure whether it was avtur (aviation fuel) from the AirAsia plane or from a vessel because that location is a shipping line,' he said. As the second day's search ended at dusk, National Search and Rescue Agency chief Bambang Soelistyo said an Indonesian corvette was on its way to collect an oil sample, with an announcement expected tomorrow.","Blogger warned on Dec 15 that 'AirAsia would be targeted by black hand'

"Animal rescue workers have expressed their shock after seven little puppies were dumped by the side of the road. It is thought the litter of mongrel pups were abandoned in a laundry basket by their  breeder because they were not sold in time for Christmas. The seven-week-old pups were left by the side of the busy country road with no food, or water, in freezing winter weather. Scroll down for video . Seven little puppies have been handed into animal rescue workers after they were found next to a busy road . Kaye Mughal, Battersea Dogs & Cats Home Old Windsor centre manager, said: 'The puppies were found on the side of a country road in a bucket, so it's very obvious they were dumped deliberately. 'Given the timing we're worried they were bred as Christmas presents by someone looking to make a quick buck, but when they failed to sell they were disposed of. 'Dumping animals without food or water near a road could have disastrous consequences, but thankfully a member of the public acted quickly, and they're now recovering from their ordeal and are looking for new homes.' The four brown and three black puppies were found by the side of a road in Chertsey, Surrey, last week and will be rehomed next year when they are old enough. Carly Whyborn, Head of Operations at Battersea, said: 'Many of these puppies are being brought to Battersea for the right reasons, but others are cruelly dumped over Christmas. 'We pick up the pieces when people buy pets as presents.'","Seven-week-old puppies found dumped by the side of a busy country road .

"Robert Dietz, 59, (pictured) was allegedly using Starbucks' free wi-fi to download the child porn . A registered sex offender has been arrested again for downloading child pornograpy at Starbucks by the same officer who caught him in 2009. Robert Dietz, 59, was allegedly using the coffee chain's free wi-fi to download the material at the large store in Hillsboro, Oregon. Sgt. Vance Stimler, a spokesman for the Washington County Sheriff's Office said Dietz, who was arrested by the same detective for the same offense in 2009. Dietz, who is on parole, was picked up after a two-month surveillance investigation, reports Oregon Live. He was arrested on Saturday by Detective Gary Wright - the policeman who caught him before. It was that conviction five years ago which led to Dietz being sentenced to 40 months in prison. Stimler said it came to their attention that someone was downloading porn at the store - it is not clear how the police found out. He speculated that Dietz was probably using the wi-fi in an attempt to conceal his tracks. Stimler said Dietz was allegedly also using another Starbucks to download the illegal material. He was arrested on Saturday at the store (pictured) in Hillsboro, Oregon by Detective Gary Wright who caught him before (file photo) Oregon Live reports that over the years Dietz has been sentenced to more than 13 years in prison following earlier convictions. Earlier this year Dietz was put on parole for failing to register as a sex offender, Stimler said. Stimler told the website that following the latest arrest Dietz could face 'substantial time' if found guilty. Dietz is being held in the Washington County Jail on charges of encouraging child sex abuse and parole violation.","Robert Dietz, 59, was allegedly using the coffee chain's free wi-fi to download the material at the store in Hillsboro, Oregon .

"Sydney will get a taste of the tropics on New Year's Eve with the world-famous fireworks display illuminating the sky with silver and gold palm trees. With over seven tonnes of fireworks set to be launched throughout the night, the city can expect one of its most colourful displays yet. Pyro technician Fortunato Foti, who has been involved in the event since 2000, has created a series of new shapes and colours for this year's event, including silver and gold palm trees. Scroll down for video . A technician packs fireworks in preparation for New Year's Eve celebrations on Sydney Harbour on Monday . Alongside the usual 9pm and midnight displays there will be a third mini-fireworks display at 10.40pm, known as the Inspire moment. 'This year we've focused on making the displays as colourful as possible - you'll see a lot of metallics, as well as bright reds, greens, blues and purples - as some fun new shapes, including palm trees with shimmering centres and multicoloured ends,' Mr Foti said. The fireworks include 11,000 shells, 25,000 shooting comets and over 100,000 individual effects. About 1.6 million people are expected to gather around the harbour for Wednesday night's display. The total cost of the Sydney New Year's Eve celebrations is $7.2 million, with $750,000 going on fireworks. The event's producer, Aneurin Coffey, says this is on a par with the spend for previous years. The creative ambassador for the celebrations, actor Jack Thompson, said he was inspired by an ode to Sydney written by his father. 'Forty years ago my father wrote a poem in praise of Sydney. He was a senior feature writer and producer for ABC radio,' Thompson said. Sydney will get a taste of the tropics on New Year's Eve with the world-famous fireworks display . Fireworks are loaded on a barge in preparation ahead of the New Year's Eve celebrations on Sydney Harbour . Creative Ambassador Jack Thompson speaks about preparations ahead of the New Year's Eve in Sydney . Thompson believes the city needs this colourful celebration now more than ever. 'Somebody said to me 'what are you looking forward to on the night?' and I said 'party, party party,' because that's what's important. We tend to throw it away and say it's just a party but celebration is probably one of the most important human activities,' he said. About 1.6 million people are expected to gather around the harbour for Wednesday night's display in Sydney . As the city has struggled in recent weeks to come to terms with tragedy, Thompson said it was important for people to get together in large numbers to celebrate and simply say yes about life. 'If you see tragedy as exemplifying the human condition then you will find yourself a very sad person. And when you recognise that what actually typifies the human condition is our joy of life, our children our celebration of family and our celebration of who we are and where we live, if this is God's creation, should we not celebrate it?' he said. From the old film, based on the Fatty Finn comic strip, to his own childhood growing up on the northern beaches and in Paddington, Thompson has been inspired to tell the city's story through the fireworks. 'When you come to the centre you'll see it's the stories, the tales of Sydney, where Sydney has come from who these people are, is what makes this city,' he said.

"The value of the rouble plummeted again today as Russia announced its economy had shrunk for the first time in more than five years. Russia's gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.5 per cent year-on-year to November, the economy ministry said, the first fall since October 2009. The announcement sent the rouble - which fluctuated wildly earlier this month prompting fears of a full financial collapse - plummeting another 5 per cent against the dollar this morning. Grim: Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and President Vladimir Putin, pictured leading a cabinet meeting on Christmas Day, are facing the first contraction of their economy in more than five years . Sliding oil prices and Western sanctions over Ukraine have continued to take their toll on Russia, whose wealthier citizens have been looking to put their money in more stable investments abroad. The ministry chalked up the negative growth to a slowdown in a number of sectors including services, agriculture, extraction of mineral resources and construction. Inflation is also growing rapidly. Amid the rouble's collapse earlier this month, Russia's central bank raised interest rates to 17 percent from 10.5 percent to prop up the currency. Russians also snapped up imported goods ahead of expected price hikes. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov had already warned last week that the economy could shrink 4 per cent next year based on oil prices of around $60 a barrel -  their lowest level for many years. Plummeting: How the value of the rouble has fallen against the pound in the last year, including in December . He predicted a budget deficit of 3 per cent and said the government would have to further reduce expenses or tap into its reserves, noting that a planned 10 per cent spending cut was not enough. The central bank has warned that the economy could contract by up to 4.8 per cent next year based on current oil prices, with a recovery not expected until 2017. During the total length of the global recession from 2008, Britain's economy contracted 6.4 per cent while Japan's fell 8.7 per cent, Italy's fell 6.9 per cent and Germany's fell 6.8 per cent. The Kremlin announced fresh steps today to keep Russia's banks afloat. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told a government session that he had just signed a decree to provide a total of a trillion roubles (£12.6billion) to Russian banks. The list of the banks and the amount that each of them will receive is expected drawn up by mid-January, according to Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov. Rouble trouble: The Kremlin has announced fresh steps to try and prop up the ailing economy and the banks . Russia's central bank also said it will offer dollar and euro loans to banks so they can help major exporters that need foreign currencies to finance operations. Many Russian companies and banks have been locked out of Western capital markets following the sanctions imposed on the country for its involvement in Ukraine. The bank's foreign currency reserve has now dropped below $400billion for the first time since August 2009, as the government has been selling the currency on the market to support its own. Mr Shuvalov said the measures should help 'the banking sector be more stable in the new circumstances and safeguard it from new shocks if they do occur,' according to the Russian news service Tass.","Kremlin said GDP contracted by 0.5% year-on-year in November .

"Israeli troops have shot dead a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who was throwing stones at drivers in the occupied West Bank. The army said soldiers had fired warning shots before opening fire on a group when they persisted hurling the stones at Israeli civilians near the Tapuah settlement, south of Nablus. Palestinian security officials said the stones had been thrown at military vehicles. They said that a 19-year-old had also been wounded in the same incident. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . The brother of a teenager shot dead in West Bank weeps over the body  Rafidya Hospital in  the city of Nablus . A Palestinian security official told AP that he believed a second boy was hurt. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to discuss the incident with the media. The military said it was investigating the incident. Israel and Palestine have suffered generations of fighting and tensions, which spilled over last summer in a 50-day war. More than 2,100 Palestinians and 72 Israelis were killed in the fighting, which disrupted the lives of millions of people.

A boy weeps as he awaits to see the body of his brother shot dead in West Bank in a stone throwing incident . Violence began to spiral with the kidnapping and deaths of three Israeli teenagers, allegedly by Hamas. This was followed by a suspected revenge killing of 16-year-old Palestinian youth by Israeli extremists. Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended cease-fire largely brokered by Egypt later in August - but tensions between Israel and Palestinians remained high, and spiked last month. Israeli soldiers evacuate the body of the 17-year-old Palestinian who was shot dead by Israeli troops . Violent demonstrations led Israel in November to restrict Muslim access to a holy site in Jerusalem that includes the al-Aqsa mosque - the third most sacred place in Islam, . It is also home to the ancient Hebrew Temple Mount - the holiest place in Judaism. With the crackdown came a fresh round of deadly Palestinian attacks. According to AFP statistics, around 20 Palestinians have been killed by the army in the West Bank since June.

"An alleged terrorist facing trial in New York City justified killing innocent people in suicide bomb attacks as a 'forgivable sin comparable to masturbation', court papers show. Ali Yasin Ahmed made the twisted claim during conversations in 2008 intercepted by federal authorities as they put him and co-defendants Mahdi Hashi and Mohammed Yusuf under surveillance. All three are to stand trial in Brooklyn charged with providing financial and material support to Somalian based militant group al-Shabaab, which has merged with al-Qaeda. Accused: Madhi Hashi (pictured) is one of three men charged with terror offences in the United States relating to the Somalian al-Qaeda affiliate, al-Shabaab . The recorded messages were presented to the federal court and reveal Yusuf expressing his doubts to Ahmed about traveling to Somalia in November, 2008, because he was frightened of becoming a suicide bomber in the war-torn nation. Ahmed though, calms his would-be terror colleague's fears by telling him that in his interpretation of Islam, suicide bombing attacks on civilians were easily justified. 'Ahmed minimized the significance of suicide bombings against civilian targets and suggested that if such attacks were in fact a sin, they were an immaterial, forgivable sin comparable to masturbation,' wrote Assistant U.S. Attorneys Shreve Ariail, Seth DuCharme and Richard Tucker in court papers submitted last week by the prosecution. The three alleged al-Shabaab members were also allegedly commanded from the United States by Arab-American Jehad Mostafa, who lived in San Diego and was on the FBI's most wanted list. Appearance: Jury selection for the trial of Ali Yasin Ahmed, Mahdi Hashi and Mohammed Yusuf will begin in February 2015 . The prosecution allege they traveled to Somalia where Hashi, 25, joined a suicide bombing squad and Ahmed, 29 and Yusuf, 31 underwent military training. Indeed, once in the troubled African nation, Yusuf appeared in a 2010 al-Shabaab propaganda video which was titled, 'Inspire the Believers', which was used as a recruiting tool, according to court papers. Yusuf is also accused of threatening to behead Lars Vilks, the Danish cartoonist who  drew a sketch mocking the Prophet Mohammad. Lawyers for the three are attempting to dismiss the charges, claiming there is no reason to prosecute them in the United States. If the three are found guilty they face spending up to 15 years in prison.","Ali Yasin Ahmed will stand trial in federal court in New York City .
Allegedly joined Somalia terror group al-Shabaab and recruited members .
Told his colleague not to worry about suicide bombing as a sin .
A previous version of this article stated incorrectly as fact rather than allegation that Mr Hashi was an Al-Shabaab member and had joined a suicide bombing squad while in Somalia. It also stated Mr Hashi was suspected of having threatened to behead Lars Vilks, when only Mohammed Yusuf faced that accusation. A caption wrongly identified the man pictured as Ali Yasin Ahmed. Finally, a conviction for knowingly providing support for terrorism does not carry a mandatory life sentence, as we wrongly suggested."

"The past 12 months have been the worst for aviation fatalities so far this decade - with the total of number of people killed if airline crashes reaching 1,050 even before the Air Asia plane vanished. Two incidents involving Malaysia Airlines planes - one over eastern Ukraine and the other in the Indian Ocean - led to the deaths of 537 people, while an Air Algerie crash in Mali killed 116 and TransAsia Airways crash in Taiwan killed a further 49 people. The remaining 456 fatalities were largely in incidents involving small commercial planes or private aircraft operating on behalf of companies, governments or organisations. Despite 2014 having the highest number of fatalities so far this decade, the total number of crashes was in fact the lowest since the first commercial jet airliner took off in 1949 - totalling just 111 across the whole world over the past 12 months. The all-time deadliest year for aviation was 1972 when a staggering 2,429 people were killed in a total of 55 plane crashes - including the crash of Aeroflot Flight 217, which killed 174 people in Russia, and Convair 990 Coronado, which claimed 155 lives in Spain. However this year's total death count of 1,212, including those presumed dead on board the missing Air Asia flight, marks a significant rise on the very low 265 fatalities in 2013 - which led to it being named the safest year in aviation since the end of the Second World War.

In total more than half the people killed in aviation incidents this year had been flying on board Malaysia-registered planes. In January a total of 12 people lost their lives in five separate incidents, while the same number of crashes in February killed 107. There were only three fatal incidents in March, but the still-unexplained incident involving Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 left 239 people dead, bringing the total to 248. April saw two incidents with a total of 10 people killed, before a spike in incidents in May saw five fatal crashes leading to 35 people losing their lives, and seven crashes in June killed 64. July was by far the worst month for aviation fatalities this year, with a Malaysia Airlines plane being shot down over eastern Ukraine killing 298 people, 116 people dying in an Air Algérie downing  in Mali, and 48 dead in the TransAsia Airways crash in Taiwan. Two other crashes killed six people bringing the total dead in airline incidents in July to 468. In August five crashes led to the deaths of 60 people, before a decline in September saw three downed planes and 12 killed, and three October incidents resulted in the deaths of 10 people. A further two crashes in November saw 11 people lose their lives. Before the disappearance of the Air Asia flight there had already been three fatal plane crashes this month, killing 13 people. Air Asia flight QZ8501 had 155 passengers on board and seven crew - all of whom are missing and feared to be dead. Wrekage: The remains of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 is seen after being shot down over eastern Ukraine . Horror: 298 people were killed when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot out of the sky in July . Despite the heavy death toll, 2014 actually had the lowest number of crashes since the first commercial jet airliner took off in 1949 - just 111 in the past 12 months. 'It will probably come as a surprise to most people, but really it was a very safe year,' Paul Hayes, of the flight consultancy business Ascend told the Wall Street Journal. Over the past 65 years, the aviation accident rate has been declining rapidly, despite more and more people taking to the skies every year. The current crash rate is 2.1 for every million planes that takes the skies - with the odds even lower on large commercial aircraft. However the distressing disappearance of AirAsia flight QZ8501 is the latest installment in Indonesia's checkered airline history which has seen the deaths of almost 650 people in 20 years. The nation has struggled with its air safety record over the past two decades as the airline market in Southeast Asia faced unparalleled demand for low-cost flights from a rapidly expanding population. While Indonesia has benefited economically from the growing market, it is struggling to meet safety standards, unable provide enough qualified pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers and updated airport technology to ensure safety. There were only three fatal incidents in March, but the still-unexplained incident involving Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 left 239 people dead, bringing the total to 248. Pictured, rescue workers search for MH370 . Carnage: 48 people were killed when a TransAsia Airways plane crashed in Taiwan in July . Despite 30 per cent of plane crashes around the world occurring as a result of weather conditions, ground-based wind-shear detection systems introduced to notify plane crews to issues are absent in many airports around Indonesia. The nation of over 250 million people is set in a region which 'needs to look at improving air infrastructure and pursue an open skies policy,' Mr Niemeijer told Quartz. The Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation recorded a 20% increase in seat volume between 2012 and 2013, totalling 5.6 million passengers on flights in the region. The figures are expected to increase, with 70% of the world's busiest routes travelling through Southeast Asia, and 30% of the world's aircraft passengers expected to travel to the region in 2014, reported Orient Aviation Journal. Crash site: Another incident in July saw an Air Algerie plane come down in Mali . 116 people died in the Air Algerie crash earlier this year. The plane crashed in the same month as MH17 . Willem Niemeijer, co-founder of Khiri Travel Group, said that 'increasing air traffic means crashes will increase as well.' In the past 20 years 532 people have died in crashes in Indonesia, and 116 people have been presumed dead. In 2014 so far there have been five major plane crashes in Southeast Asia, including the doomed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 en route to Kuala Lumpur, and the disappearance of MH370 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. There has been one major flight incident in Indonesia annually for the past three years, including the disappearance of the AirAsia flight on Sunday which was carrying 155 passengers and seven crew members on board.

"Six horses have died at a Florida equestrian center where at least 22 of the animals stabled there were poisoned by tainted feed. Yet two more horses had to be euthanized Friday at the Masterpiece Equestrian Center in Davie. All the horses at the center ate the contaminated feed, and all are expected to eventually die. Their owners can do little except keep vigil over the animals as their health fails. Sophia Gosttschall (left) and her sister Izabella, who recently lost her horse to a batch of tainted feed, talk to one of the remaining horses at the Masterpiece Equestrian Center in Davie, Florida . One of the remaining sick horses, among the total of 22 animals that are expected to die from tainted feed, stands in the sun on December 16 . The equestrian center, where horses began to die in October, has reached a settlement with the company that produced and sold the feed, said Andy Yaffa, the attorney representing the center and the owners of 20 of the horses. The terms of the settlement last week with Lakeland Animal Nutrition are confidential, but Yaffa said Monday that his clients will be able to buy new horses and care for the remaining ailing horses. The afflicted horses range from ponies worth $25,000 to $50,000 to elite competitors worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. 'The remaining horses continue to deteriorate — unfortunately,' Yaffa said. 'We knew they would but did not want to believe it.  We also did not realize it would be so fast.' The feed arrived at the center in September but it was weeks before anyone realized something was wrong with all the horses at Masterpiece. Since the first deaths in October, the horses' owners have tried to keep their animals comfortable, lavishing attention on them with 'spa days' in their stables. All riding lessons were suspended, and the parents of the center's youngest riders struggled to explain how all the horses, not just one or two, were dying and there was nothing anyone could do except give the horses extra treats and grooming. Lakeland Animal Nutrition has said the contamination was limited to the feed at Masterpiece, and no other horses elsewhere were reported sickened because of it. The Lakeland-based company recalled the product, stopped producing equine feeds and acknowledged that feed delivered to Masterpiece contained monensin and lasalocid, anti-bacterial additives safe for livestock such as cattle and some poultry but toxic to horses' muscles. Ava Exelbirt hugs one of the remaining horses at the Masterpiece Equestrian Center on Dec. 16, before a total of six horses had to be euthanized due to tainted feed poisoning . General manager Jonathan Lang said the 95-year-old company was devastated by the losses at Masterpiece. 'Although their beloved animals could never be replaced, it is our hope that this settlement will bring them some peace and allow them to continue pursuing their passion for equestrian care and sport,' Lang said in an email. Necropsies performed on four horses that died at Masterpiece before the settlement last week confirmed monensin poisoning. Happier times: Parents say it was a struggle to explain to some of the center's youngest riders that all the horses, not just one or two, were dying and there was nothing anyone could do except give the horses extra treats and grooming . A couple of young riders pose for pictures earlier in December with horses that did not eat the tainted feed . The remaining horses all showed the same progressive symptoms, including difficulty standing, but no more necropsies will be needed, Yaffa said. 'We know what's causing this,' Yaffa said, adding that Lakeland Animal Nutrition had 'acted honorably throughout the restoration process.' Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is investigating. The afflicted horses, not including Daniella Vitale's Sebastian (pictured in December), range from ponies worth $25,000 to $50,000 to elite competitors worth hundreds of thousands of dollars .","Two more horses had to euthanized at the Masterpiece Equestrian Center in Davie, Florida, bringing the death toll to six since October .

"A woman who gained three stone while serving as an officer in the Royal Navy has shed the extra weight in time for her perfect wedding. Gemma Allardyce, 32, from North Shields, found it a struggle to keep off the weight due to the lively social life and drinking culture that comes with being a sailor. Even an active tour of duty in Afghanistan failed to do the trick and she continued to pile on the pounds. Scroll down for video . A food-fueled lifestyle saw Naval officer Gemma Allardyce, 32, from North Shields, gain three stone (left). Even a tour of Afghanistan failed to shift weight. But a fear of looking fat at her wedding helped her drop five dress sizes (right). 'When the opportunity to go to Afghanistan came up, I jumped at the chance' said Gemma adding that she had actually expected to lose weight. 'After all, six and a half months in a war zone where you can't drink and going to the gym was your only form of social interaction, you're bound to come back 'body beautiful' right?' However, Gemma found that the boozy social life of the Navy left her piling on the pounds. 'The lifestyle in the Navy is a party lifestyle - drinking was massive; drinking and unhealthy food.' It wasn't until Gemma was shopping for her wedding dress and was forced to settle on a 18 gown that she decided drastic action had to be taken. Gemma decided to start dieting a year ago and was able to drop five dress sizes in time for her wedding last summer . She joined Slimming World and slimmed down to a size eight bride for her nuptials last summer to husband James Allardyce. Although you need to be fit to be in the Navy, Gemma says that there is no need to be slim and her career left her at a curvy size 18 . Gemma, who is planning to leave the Royal Navy in April after 14 years to become a beautician, said her weight would fluctuate from 11 to 13 stone, but claims this isn't uncommon among naval officers. She said: 'It's the lifestyle in the Navy. There are two chefs on board so you get your five-a-day but there's always unhealthy food around. She continued: 'You've got to be fit in the Navy but you don't have to be slim.' The yo-yo dieter did lose weight during her six months in Afghanistan, and became engaged to James on her return, but she had piled it back on by November last year and had to settle on picking out a size 18 wedding dress. She transformed her diet, replacing junk food and snacks with lean meats and plenty of vegetables. Gemma, who has tried numerous fad diets, says that the healthy eating plan was the only diet she has had success at - and the only one James, a scaffolder and also a qualified personal trainer, has approved of. She said: 'We used to do two separate meals but now there's one for the two of us. 'It's such a big difference to have that time and just sit down at the dining room table at the end of the day and have the same thing.' She continued: 'The diet has been really easy to do - I felt I was eating more and getting better results.' By May, when she received a phone call letting her know that her wedding dress was in, she was around 10 stone - but had failed to tell the shop about her dramatic loss. Staff at the dress shop were stunned at the difference and had quite a job on their hands to re-shape the gown. Gemma said: 'It was slipping off. They had to pin it all the way down and there were huge flaps down the sides where they had to pin it too. 'They almost took the dress apart and put it back together again.' Having dropped a total of 2st 13lb to hit her target weight of 9st 1lb, her new look was revealed to most of her family and friends for the first time at her July wedding. Gemma is now keen to inspire others to shift the extra pounds . She said: 'I was really excited because I wanted natural pictures taken but in the past I was always having to hold myself in and lift my head up. 'When I saw the pictures there were so many that had been taken when I didn't even know the photographer was there - and I'm smiling and natural looking.' And now, a year on from the day she joined the weight-loss club, she's hoping to inspire others by launching her very own Slimming World class in her hometown . Gemma is will be holding her first classes on January 1 and 2, exactly 365 days after she took the plunge herself.","The Navy lifestyle of boozy nights out saw Gemma gain three stone .
Even a tour of Afghanistan failed to keep off the pounds for long .
A fear of looking fat at her wedding finally forced her to go on a diet ."
"Left dangling in mid-air: The Mayor's 2012 Olympic gaffe . Few people seem to be in much of a rush during the rush hour here. There is certainly nothing that could be described as a queue at this station. At times, there is no one at all. According to the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, the £60 million trans-Thames shuttle — Britain’s first urban cable car, no less — is a ‘much-needed new river crossing in the east of our great city’. He has even incorporated it into the hallowed London Tube map. However, according to figures just revealed (but only after a Freedom of Information request), this is arguably the most pointless piece of public transport in the country. For since its grand opening two years ago, the total number of commuters using the panoramic Emirates Air Line to travel to work appears to have fallen to an all-time low — of none at all. This astonishing statistic is based on the number of Oyster cards (London travel passes) used on the cable car during a given week this autumn. Regular users are deemed to be those who take the £3.30 service in either direction five times or more in a week and they qualify for a half-price discount. So how many regular users does the thing have? Precisely none. Extraordinary. Or to put it in Johnsonian terms: Cripes! So much for Mr Mayor’s boast that his ten-seater fibreglass bubbles over the Thames have been ‘a howling success’, bringing ‘new jobs, homes and enterprise’ to ‘a vibrant new metropolitan quarter’. This scheme is more like his other attempt at suspended travel when he set off down that Olympic zip wire in 2012 — and famously got stuck. Scroll down for video . View of the O2: To be fair, the cable car has had precious little commuter traffic ever since it opened in 2012 . Across the water: Spanning the Thames between the O2 Arena on the southern bank and the Royal Docks with its ExCel exhibition centre to the north, the idea was to carry up to 2,500 people an hour . A Transport for London (TfL) spokesman insists commuters really do exist. It is just that they do not travel in ‘conventional’ ways. I might be more inclined to swallow this PR spiel if I wasn’t immediately ordered off the premises and told I need a special permit to talk to the public. So I stand at the station perimeter and talk to people there. And they all still seem to be tourists. To be fair, the cable car has had precious little commuter traffic ever since it opened in 2012. During its first year, the number of regular users was found to be 16. Last year, that had fallen to four. Now, they would appear to be extinct. Since its grand opening two years ago, the total number of commuters using the panoramic Emirates Air Line to travel to work appears to have fallen to an all-time low — of none at all . TfL’s head of the Air Line, Danny Price, tells me the figures are misleading because regular users tend to buy a book of discounted tickets, which they can use any time, rather than pay with their Oyster cards. But even he says that regulars comprise just 3 per cent of his customers. Darryl Chamberlain, the local blogger who submitted the Freedom of Information request, says the number is a single round figure: nought. Whether the true answer is ‘a handful’ or zero, the question remains the same: why on earth was this white elephant — connecting two not very interesting places — built in the first place? Spanning the Thames between the O2 Arena — the old Millennium Dome — on the southern bank and the Royal Docks with its ExCel exhibition centre to the north, the idea was to carry up to 2,500 people an hour. Questions: Why on earth was this white elephant - connecting two not very interesting places - built in the first place? A third were expected to be regular commuters, a third were expected to be visitors travelling between events on either side of the river and the remaining third would simply be enjoying the ride. It would play a modest role during the 2012 Games since it connected two Olympic sites (but this was useful only if you happened to have tickets for both). As it turns out, the vast majority of passengers (70 per cent, according to TfL’s surveys; 95 per cent, according to mine) are simply here for fun. In other words, it’s a theme park ride. But it is hardly the role of our transport authorities to build funfair attractions. The £60 million construction cost was met by £36 million in sponsorship from Emirates, £8 million from an EU regional slush fund and £16 million from the taxpayer. While the former Mayor, Ken Livingstone, predicted that the project would be a ‘disaster’, Johnson was delighted to have another eye-catching wheeze to go with his ‘Boris’ rent-a-bikes and his hop on/hop off buses. ‘Get on this immediately!’ he proclaimed at the end of his inaugural flight. It would be wrong to say that this spectacular ride, dangling nearly 300 ft over the Thames for the best part of ten minutes, is unpopular. Each week, thousands of tourists make the round trip, so much so that TfL insist the cable car is paying its way and enjoys exemplary ‘customer satisfaction’ scores. Sitting up here, even on a grey and windy afternoon, I can see why. As a visitor attraction, it is not unlike the London Eye, the capital’s big wheel near Waterloo station. This cable car might not overlook Big Ben and Buckingham Palace, but it commands an impressive view of the gritty end of London, it’s only a fraction of the price of the £29.50-a-time wheel and you certainly don’t need to book in advance. Taking off from the south side, I get a cracking view of the former Dome, liberated from state control and reborn as a concert venue. To the east, the mighty vaulted sluices of the Thames Barrier are faintly reminiscent of the Sydney Opera House. The skyscrapers of Canary Wharf blot out much of the broader London landscape but I can see Royal Greenwich in one direction and the Olympic Park in the other. What is striking is how much old-fashioned industry is still here in the East End, much of it unchanged since World War II. It dawns on me that the last time people routinely flew this low over places such as Silvertown and Trinity Buoy Wharf, they were in Luftwaffe uniform. We come in to land at Royal Docks and it’s not terribly inviting. There are a few lifeless apartment blocks, a couple of coffee shops, a halal burger van and a Tesco Metro. The ExCel exhibition centre is a five-minute walk away, but there’s nothing on there today. Most cable car passengers stay on board and go straight back to North Greenwich. Among those I do find wandering around are the Fairweather family from Greenwich. Despite living nearby, they had never used the cable car until today. ‘It’s been on our to do list for a long time and now we’ve done it,’ says Dad. All like the views. But they cannot see the point of an aerial link between two places already connected by the Tube (and it’s only a couple of stops). TfL insists the cable car carries 1.5 million paying customers each year and this figure will increase as the area is developed. ‘It’s great to have something that gives the area an identity,’ says Danny Price, adding that it is the first project in London transport history to attract complaints for being too quick. ‘When we started, it took five minutes to get across and people complained it wasn’t long enough.’ Now, it’s a five-minute ride before 9am and ten minutes thereafter. Former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, pictured, predicted the project would be a ‘disaster’ But even if it does manage to repay the £16 million spent by the taxpayer, should the state be wasting time on this sort of vanity project? And does it really deserve to be on the world-famous London Tube map with its very own livery? I suppose it makes a good pub quiz question: Which London Tube line is marked in red and white? Answer: The Emirates Air Line. As dusk falls, I search for a phantom commuter in the evening rush hour. Finally, a lone figure alights purposefully with a walking stick at North Greenwich. Could it be . . . ? ‘Yup. I’m your man,’ laughs Peter Vickers, 60. ‘I’ve been using this every day since it opened to get to work and I think it’s fantastic.’ The disabled father of three gets a mini-cab from his home in Charlton, South London, to the cable car, uses a discounted book of tickets rather than an Oyster card to fly over the Thames and then picks up a minicab on the other side to his office in Ilford, East London. ‘It’s hard to get a seat on the Tube and the cable car has step-free access. My brother calls it the best-kept secret in London.’ Perhaps its day will come. Perhaps, like its neighbour, the old Dome, the Air Line will evolve from a national joke into a national treasure. Perhaps TfL will eventually uproot it and put it somewhere genuinely useful. In the meantime, just sit back and enjoy the peace, the view and the emptiness on Boris’s East End ghost train.","According to London's Mayor, the trans-Thames shuttle is ‘much-needed’

"Soaring numbers of Britons are looking into having nose jobs and breast operations, figures from a private healthcare search engine reveal. The biggest jump in cosmetic surgery inquiries was for nose jobs and mini-facelifts, up around 1,200 per cent each compared with last year, WhatClinic.com said. Breast operations are still the most popular procedure, with searches up 80 per cent this year. Breast surgery remains the most popular procedure, with searches up 80 per cent this year, while the biggest jump in cosmetic surgery inquiries was for nose jobs and mini-facelifts . And inquiries for slimming operations, such as liposuction, the third most popular surgical treatment in the UK, were up around 250 per cent. Fat transfer was close behind in fourth and tummy tucks in seventh place, in terms of enquiries. While queries about mini facelifts rose eleven-fold in the past 12 months, and eye-lift surgery enquiries increased almost sixfold. Those asking for muscle implants dropped by 69 per cent in the past 12 months as demand for the treatment waned. Cheekbone reduction, post-bariatric plastic surgery, bra-line back lift and closed rhinoplasty enquiries remained static in 2014. Emily Ross, director of WhatClinic.com, said ‘The cosmetic surgery and injectables market in the UK is expected to be worth as much as £3.6 billion in 2015.

"News consumption among young adults is in rapid decline, according to a new study. A poll conducted by the Associated Press and the NORC at the University of Chicago revealed that only 37per cent of under 30s consider it 'very important' to keep up-to-date with current affairs compared to 56per cent 30 years ago. One college junior quizzed as part of the findings said that she doesn't follow politics much because of 'so much negativity'. Consumer trend: News consumption among young adults is in rapid decline, according to a new study . Overall, despite unprecedented access to information, 28per cent of survey participants felt 'no obligation' to stay informed. On the other hand, findings show today's youth are more inclined to volunteer in a bid to give back. Among six civic activities in the poll, volunteering was the only one that adults under 30 rated as highly as older people did. 'I want to make my city where I live a better place,' Morgan Gress, 24, of Washington said after sorting and hanging donated clothes with co-workers who chose to volunteer in lieu of an office holiday party. After you volunteer, she said, 'You never walk away feeling you didn't have a great time, or help someone out, or learn something new.' Today's young adults grew up amid nudges from a volunteering infrastructure that has grown exponentially since their parents' day, when the message typically came through churches or scouting. Gress doesn't find it unusual that her employer, a hub for tech startups called 1776, encouraged workers to sort clothes at Bread for the City during office hours. Most of her friends work at companies with some sort of volunteer program, she says. Community service was required at her private high school in Buffalo, New York, like many other schools across the country. Volunteer opportunities were plentiful as a student at American University. In the decades since President George H.W. Bush championed America's volunteer groups as 'a thousand points of light' at his 1989 inaugural, the number of nonprofits has skyrocketed. The Martin Luther King Jr. holiday and September 11 have become days of service. Individuals launch community projects through social media, instead of hanging posters and making phone calls. Twenty percent of adults under 30 volunteered in 2013, up from 14 percent in 1989, according to census data analyzed by the Corporation for National and Community Service. It seems likely that the Millennials' volunteering rate will climb higher, because past generations have peaked in their 30s and 40s, when many parents give their time to schools, youth groups or community improvements. Giving back: On the other hand, findings show today's youth are more inclined to volunteer  - here Morgan Gress from the company 1776,  is seen volunteering at Bread for the City in Washington . 'We're on the crux of something big, because these Millennials are going to take this spirit of giving and wanting to change communities and they're going to become parents soon,' said Wendy Spencer, CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service. 'I am very encouraged by what we're seeing.' The vast majority of Americans believe citizenship comes with an array of responsibilities. But the strength of that conviction has weakened since the General Social Survey asked about obligations of citizenship in 1984. Seventy-seven percent say reporting a crime you witness is very important, down from 90 percent three decades ago in the survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. Three-quarters call voting in elections very important, about the same as in the 1984 survey, though only about 36 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in November's midterms. Despite some experts hoping that volunteering will lead to a strong return to political participation and other civic virtues, Rutgers University Professor Cliff Zukin, who studies civic engagement, sees little prospect. He believes interest was already waning well before today's young adults came of age. 'They're starting at a very, very low point,' he said. 'And each generation seems to have peaked at less than the previous generation.' The poll of 1,044 young adults was conducted online July 24 to 28, 2014.","The Associated Press and the NORC at the University of Chicago conducted a poll of 1,044 young Americans focused on civic activities .

"An Australian man, who is believed to have been fighting alongside terrorist organisation the Islamic State in Syria, has been reportedly killed in the war-torn country. The Syria 24 News Network reported that Lebanese born Ahmad Mohamad al-Ghaz'zaoui (also spelt Al-Ghazzawi) who is believed to have formerly lived in Bankstown in Sydney's west, was killed by the Syrian army as a member of ISIS on December 27,News Corp reports. Following news of his death, dozens of people took to social media to show support and praise the alleged terrorist. Ahmad Mohamad al-Ghaz'zaoui (also spelt Al-Ghazzawi) (pictured) who previously lived in Bankstown in Sydney's west, is believed to have been killed by the Syrian army as a member of ISIS on December 27 . In a series of posts to his Facebook page, Sydney business manager Abo Elmineh, dubbed Al-Ghazzawi a 'martyr' and a hero'. Written in Arabic, his messages  asked for God to 'rest his soul in peace' and stated that Ghazzawi had 'died in the land of the pure'. Dozens of people followed suit, writing comments such as: 'God have mercy on him' and asking for 'God to make him a martyr'. Others, such as Hassan Ghazzawi, went as far as to call him their 'hero'. However many others responded to Syria 24's announcement with disgust towards the Australia, writing: 'One way ticket to hell this pig' and 'Good riddance'. Following news of his death, dozens of people took to social media to show support and praise the alleged terrorist . In a series of posts to his Facebook page, Sydney business manager Abo Elmineh, dubbed Al-Ghazzawi a 'martyr' and a hero' Australian officials have so far been unable to confirm news of Al-Ghazzawi's death nor whether he had fled Australia to join ISIS fighters in Syria, News Corp reports. Earlier this month, Attorney-General George Brandis revealed that approximately 20 Australians were known by the government to have died in conflict in Syria and Iraq so far, the ABC reported. Amongst them: Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who was believed to have recruited dozens to fight overseas and was part of a plot to kill citizens in Sydney and Brisbane, 33-year-old former Brisbane City Council worker Zia Abdul Haq who died in October, Australian soldier Caner Temel who died in Syria in January and Sydney couple Yusuf Ali and who were killed in the Syrian city of Aleppo. News of Al-Ghazzawi's comes after revelations that Melbourne model Sharky Jama, traded in his 'budding' career for a life devoted to the Islamic State in the Middle East. The Australian reported that Jama and friend, former La Trobe University student Yusuf Yusuf, claim to have fled Australian for the key IS outposts of Fallujah, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, respectively. In various pictures published by his modelling agency, Jama, of Somalian descent, is seen posing for photographs in smart casual clothing. Al-Ghazzawi's death was reported by the Syria 24 News Network on December 27 (left). many readers responded to the announcement with disgust towards the Australia (right), writing:  'Good riddance' Jama's role in Fallujah - the first major city to fall to the Islamic State in 2014 - is not known, but is no doubt very different to his Australian occupation. The Federal government believes more than 70 Australians have fled to join the fighting in Iraq and Syria and the passports of more than 100 others have been cancelled. Counter-terrorism researcher Dr Anne Aly, from Curtin University, told Daily Mail Australia the young men matched the 'typical' profile of Australians joining the Islamic State. 'That is pretty much a very typical profile, young men who for all intents and purposes seem to be quite well integrated... but then there's something that turns them'. 'It might take a year, it might take six months and if they continue down that path and become more and more radicalised they get to the point where they're ready to take action'. It comes after revelations that Melbourne model Sharky Jama, traded in his 'budding' career for a life devoted to the Islamic State in the Middle East . Some pictures of Jama, above, feature him sauntering down laneways wearing a fedora, while others show him posing in high-top sneakers and colourful scarfs . While many Australians have taken up arms on behalf of the Islamic State, and several have died, others have joined the terrorist group's propaganda arm. Last week, it was reported that a western Sydney man has joined the organisation's media arm, which produces its slick, high-definition propaganda packages for broadcast and upload. The man is understood to be working as a video editor. He described his life as 'pretty typical' in an interview with The Australian newspaper. 'I have a job, I live in a HQ, eat, sleep, work, hope an airstrike gets me so I can be Shaheed (martyred),' he was quoted saying. Two Australian nationals have featured in Islamic State videos - the so-called 'Ginger Jihadi', Abdullah Elmir, 17 and Zakaria Raad, 22. Elmir has not appeared in a video since October, when he was broadcast wearing military fatigues and surrounded by chanting Islamic State militants. Raad was reported killed shortly after his appearance in a July recruitment video with other militants.

"Rare  footage showing the iconic 1970s police patrol car known as the 'Jam Sandwich' in action has been unearthed and shown for the first time. Rover 3500s, affectionately named because the distinctive orange and white markings resembled jam between two slices of bread, were a familiar sight on Britain's roads. The slang was popularised on TV shows including 1970s police drama The Sweeney, Minder, Life on Mars starring Philip Glenister as DCI Gene Hunt and Only Fools and Horses. Scroll down for video .

The SD1 model cars, which boasted a powerful V8 engine, could reach speeds of up to 125mph. Rare promotional footage showing the car being taken for a test drive was released by West Midlands Police today after it was discovered in the force's archive.

'It is a highly sophisticated piece of British engineering and manufacturing,' the promotional video states. 'Road users across the West Midlands see the cars as a beacon of authority'. A spokesman said: 'With a V8 engine they could achieve speeds of around 125 miles an hour and could easily out pace most other vehicles on the road. 'In fact in the early days the only way an officer could detect a vehicle's speed was to run alongside it and then read their own speedometer. 'It's hard to imagine it these days, but back in the 70s high performance cars were only driven by the very rich, royalty or police officers. 'Hence the attraction of the job for many a small boy.

"A mother-of-two was was forced to spend her dying days moving house to get drugs that could have prolonged her life, her devastated family say. Emma Chalk was yet another victim of the postcode lottery apartheid between England and Wales, where patients in Wales are often refused drugs they would be entitled to if they lived over the border in England. Mrs Chalk, 46, lived in Flintshire, North Wales, less than five miles from Chester - where the drug pomalidomide to treat her terminal cancer would have been available on the NHS. Despite even having a Chester postcode, she was forced to hunt for a flat with husband Len, 49, instead of being treated for bone marrow cancer. She died on November 11, three weeks after securing a flat that cost £400 a month. Emma Chalk (with husband Len, daughter Amy and son Lenny) was denied a life-extending cancer drug because she lived in Wales. Had she lived five miles away, over the English border, she would have got it . Despite even having a Chester postcode, Mrs Chalk was another victim of the postcode lottery apartheid between England and Wales, where patients in Wales are often refused drugs they would be entitled to if they lived over the border. Map shows how close she lived to the border and the hospital where she lost her life . Mr and Mrs Chalk had been forced to hunt for a flat in England instead of her being treated for bone marrow cancer. She died on November 11, three weeks after securing a flat that cost £400 a month . The  couple spent a total of £1,500 on the flat, which included a deposit, bond and the first month's rent. Mrs Clark, who worked for the NHS at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales, had been battling cancer for 11 years. She was suffering from myeloma, also known as multiple myeloma - a cancer arising from cells made in the bone marrow. The former NHS nurse underwent two stem cell transplants, but died last month at the Countess of Chester Hospital. She had been having maintenance chemotherapy and the drug pomalidomide had shown it could extend her life by a number of months. As a result, her oncologist complied a 56-page document asking for Emma to be granted the drug. He presented the report to the All Welsh Medicine Strategy Group, an advisory body on medicinal usage in Wales, but the panel refused the treatment. Mrs Chalk's husband Len, an ex-Army Warrant Officer who was married to his wife for 25 years, has blasted officials for 'playing God' with his wife's life. He said: 'I realise that there aren't endless pots of money - but what price are they putting on life? 'We live 4.5 miles away from the English/Welsh border. 'Instead of spending crucial moments together, we were looking for flats. 'Emma was lying in the hospital alongside people who could have the treatment and had been given the treatment yet she couldn't because she lived in a different postcode to them. 'This drug was put on the table before hospital treatment even started - but it was taken away from us because of a postcode.' He added: 'I believe the Welsh government are partaking in selective euthanasia - they are choosing who lives and who dies.' Mrs Chalk had been having maintenance chemotherapy and the drug pomalidomide had shown it could extend her life by a number of months . Mr Chalk said: 'Emma was an amazing mother and lived for her kids - it's crazy how she's been treated' He said it was his wife's aim in life to see the couple's two children Len, 18, who suffers from learning disabilities, and Amy, 14, through to adulthood. Mr Chalk said: 'Emma was an amazing mother and lived for her kids. 'Thankfully, my daughter Amy has been my rock. She's been absolutely fantastic. Len has his own way of dealing with it but he's aware of what's happened. 'It's crazy how she's been treated. 'They were caring for her and then when the treatment came along they said no. 'They just cut her off.' A spokesperson from the All Welsh Medicine Strategy Group said: 'Pomalidomide was not proven to be cost effective on the evidence presented. 'So it wasn't made available to the NHS in Wales and wasn't recommended for patient use.

"Jeb Bush has surged into the lead in the Republican presidential candidate race according to the latest poll. The surge in popularity follows his announcement last week to 'actively explore' a bid to run in the 2016 race. According to the survey by CNN in conjunction with OCR, he is the choice of nearly a quarter (24 per cent) of GOP supporters interviewed and ten points ahead of his closest rival, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (13 per cent). Scroll down for video . Jeb Bush has the largest lead in the polls by a Republican presidential hopeful in two years. The former Governor of Florida is 10 points ahead of closest rival, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie . Physician Ben Carson came in third with 7 per cent of the support, while Senator Rand Paul and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee were tied for fourth with 6 per cent. It is the first time that a GOP potential has led beyond a poll's margin of error in the past two years. However, of the Republicans polled, some said they were less likely to vote for him on some of the issues he has encountered as the Governor of Florida. For example 42 per cent say his description of illegal immigration as an 'act of love' make them less likely to support Bush, but another 39 per cent say it makes no difference to them. In the Democratic race, Hilary Clinton is still the runaway favorite, with two-thirds of support within her party. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is the closest to her, but with a distant 9 per cent. Bush last week said that he is going to 'active explore' a bid to run for the White House. He has constantly been ahead of his competitors in 2016 polls . Last week Bush showed more signs he was preparing for a run at the White House. He stopped booking paid speeches, though he will follow through on previous commitments through early next year. After his father's loss Bush decided to stay in politics, first as a campaign manager for Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and later as a candidate himself. He failed at his first attempt to be elected to public office but succeeded at winning the governor's mansion on his second try in 1998.

"Questions were being asked last night about the effectiveness of Ebola screening after it emerged the infected nurse had been vetted twice. The woman was screened in both Sierra Leone and London but her symptoms were not detected. Professor Jonathan Ball, an expert in molecular virology at Nottingham University, said the case showed the procedure was unable to spot Ebola. The woman was screened in both Sierra Leone and London but her symptoms were not detected . He said this was because symptoms such as a high temperature can take up to three weeks to develop. 'When [screening] was introduced it was more a measure of reassurance rather than something that actually worked,' he said. 'Because the incubation period for Ebola is up to 21 days, it's impossible to detect as you don't show symptoms.' In October, ministers were accused of a chaotic response to the Ebola crisis when it emerged screening measures amounted to little more than a questionnaire. The tests involve assessing passengers' recent travel history and who they have been in contact with, as well as a possible medical assessment. Passengers who have come from Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea are put in a separate queue at customs. In a holding area, they are asked how they are feeling, whether they have been in contact with Ebola victims and if they have touched bush meat. If the medical staff are concerned, they start a full assessment. But they stop short of screening passengers with thermal guns to pick out those with an elevated temperature, a procedure adopted in the US. Questions were being asked last night about the effectiveness of Ebola screening after it emerged the infected UK nurse had been vetted twice . Health chiefs will be disturbed that the nurse was able to travel on a plane after developing symptoms. Spreading from person to person as a result of direct contact with skin or bodily fluids such as blood or sweat, the deadly virus is extremely infectious. However the afflicted nurse's fellow passengers on her flight to London are unlikely to have contracted it because it is not airborne. They would not be at risk from breathing the same cabin air and it would be exceptionally unlucky to catch it from an armrest, a touch-screen television or a seat-back tray. But there will be concern over anyone who may have had close contact with the woman – such as her partner – and for any health officials who treated her after she became ill but before she was diagnosed. The virus can enter the body via infected droplets through broken skin or mucous membranes such as the eyes or the lining of the nose. Ferociously infectious while inside a human body or bodily fluid, it is far less so on an inert surface where it lasts for no longer than a few minutes. But guidelines on tackling Ebola say a carpet or seat cover that is dirty from blood or body fluids should be discarded in the same way as biohazardous material. Precautions: William Pooley starts his journey home from Sierra Leone in an air isolation unit . To avoid catching the disease, medical workers must wear goggles, incinerate clothing and clinical waste and decontaminate medical equipment that needs to be kept. When she arrives at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London, the health worker will be admitted through a specially-assigned hospital entrance, before being taken to the high-level isolation unit – the only ward in the UK equipped to cope with ebola. It is the same unit that nursed fellow British nurse William Pooley back to health after he contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone in August. The latest victim will occupy a £25,000 bed that will be burned after she leaves the hospital. An intravenous drip will pump saline solution into her body to stop the organs failing. Doctors will also treat the bleeding from her nose, eyes and ears. If they cannot get hold of experimental Ebola drug ZMapp, they will simply try to manage the disease until her immune system is strong enough to fight it off. A filtration system will suck the air away, removing all contaminated vapour before it is pumped out of the building.","Questions over Ebola screening after failure to detect symptoms .

"Spying on spouses and partners through mobile phone bugging systems has reached epidemic proportions, according to pressure groups (picture posed by model) Spying on spouses and partners through mobile phone bugging systems has reached epidemic proportions, according to pressure groups monitoring electronic abuse. They warned women to guard against the growing use of ‘spyware’ which can tell a suspicious husband, boyfriend or former partner how they are using their phones. Cheaply available software will allow an electronic shadower to hear phone conversations, monitor emails, texts and social media messages, and even track the phone’s whereabouts using GPS tracking. The legitimate user of the phone can be left unaware that she or he is being followed and overheard. Some devices are easily available in Britain for less than £100 and software marketed in the US can be installed for less than £50. The Digital-Trust group said yesterday in the aftermath of Christmas – a time of year notorious for the high numbers of couples who break up: ‘Women leaving abusive relationships and seeking refuge will often unwittingly lead abusers to their location via mobile phones. ‘Mobiles can track the victim if the phone is registered to the abuser, if they have access to the victim’s Google or iPhone online account, or surveillance software or app has been put on the phone.’ Polly Neate of the Women’s Aid group told the Independent: ‘We increasingly hear stories of abusers adding tracking software to phones, placing spyware on personal computers and using the internet to gather information about their partner. ‘However, in many cases the police are not trained to recognise and understand the impact of online abuse, including tracking, and action is rarely taken against abusers.’ A number of laws governing communications offences appear to criminalise men or women who put a spyware app on a partner or target’s phone and overhear messages and calls without their permission. However one key piece of legislation, the 1998 Data Protection Act, sets the maximum penalty for spying offences as no more than a fine. One device that can be used for spying marketed in Britain by the Maplin chain is the Cell Phone Recon system, which provides software which can be installed on a target phone. Buyers are told they can ‘find out the whereabouts of your loved ones’ and ‘monitor employees.' Scroll down for video . Women have been warned to guard against the growing use of ‘spyware’ which can tell a suspicious husband, boyfriend or former partner how they are using their phones . The system is described at ‘cell phone backup software’, which can be used for checking the use of your own phone and finding it if it is lost. However, following concern over the potential use of the softeware, Maplin has added a warning to those who want to ‘check my partner’s texts for the normal reasons to find out if he cheating’. Buyers are told: ‘This device is intended as a backup device for your messages, emails and calls or can be used to find the whereabouts of your loved ones, monitor employees or keep track of your children. This device should not be used for any other purpose. The software/device must not be installed without prior permission from the owner of the device.’ Another easy-to-find system is the Flexispy, marketed from the US at under £45 a month under the slogan: ‘Their cell phone will tell you what they won’t.’ Advertised as a way to find out if your husband or wife is cheating, the system will, once installed on a spouse’s phone, allow you to ‘know for sure what your partner is really feeling, saying and doing when you are not there,’ promoters say. The Data Protection Act makes it an offence ‘to knowingly or recklessly obtain, disclose or procure the disclosure of personal information without the consent of the data controller.’ However the punishment for offences is no more than a fine. A number of other laws may cover spyware, among them the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, 2000, which was used to prosecute newspaper phone hackers. However the law has never been used against a stalker or a suspicious spouse hacking the phone of a personal target.","Spying on spouses through phone 'spyware' is rife, pressure groups say .

In a final interview she said her year-long hunger strike had been painful and difficult but described her life with progressive MS as ‘unacceptable’. A Dignity in Dying spokesman said she 'chose to hasten her death by stopping eating'. He said: 'Towards the end of her life she wanted to control her death and refused food. 'It was a difficult and on-going process for her and it took a number of weeks for her life to end.' Ms Purdy had suffered with primary progressive multiple sclerosis for almost 20 years. She had been confined to a wheelchair since 2001 and recently she had been unable to move at all without help. In 2009, she won a ruling to get clarification on whether her husband Omar Puente would be prosecuted if he helped her to end her life. She wanted assurances that the Cuban-born violinist would not face prosecution if he accompanied her to the Swiss assisted dying clinic Dignitas. She was aware that she had divided public opinion but insisted it was still preferable to her debilitating form of MS, saying: ‘To disagree with me is to condemn me to 30 years of this.’ Mr Puente, a music teacher, today confirmed the death of his wife in a statement, paying tribute to 'a much loved wife, sister, aunt and friend'. Ms Purdy pictured with her husband Omar Puente outside the House of Lords following her win in 2009 . He told the BBC: 'We would like to thank the Marie Curie Hospice in Bradford for the care the staff gave her, which allowed her last year to be as peaceful and dignified as she wished.' 1995: Diagnosed with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis  at the age of 31. 2008: Began legal battle  by launching a High Court bid to force CPS to clarify what actions would lead to a friend or relative being charged under the 1961 Suicide Act. 2008: Lost battle and subsequent Court of Appeal case. 2009: Won legal victory when she forced the Department for Public Prosecutions to clarify assisted suicide circumstances, although the law remained unchanged. 2009: This led to 16 new guidelines on assisted suicide being which clarified what actions would lead to prosecution of those who helped a suicide. 2010: Told an inquiry that if she had not won she would have gone to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to end her life. December 2013: Entered the Marie Curie hospice in Bradford. December 23, 2014: Died aged 51 after refusing food for weeks. Campaign group Dignity in Dying expressed sadness over her death, describing her as a 'valued campaigner and friend'. Chief executive Sarah Wootton said: 'Debbie wanted choice and control over her death should she consider her suffering unbearable. 'Ultimately she was seeking peace of mind that her wishes would be respected, but also crucially that her decisions would not result in the potential imprisonment of her husband. 'She rejected the option of travelling abroad to die, and instead, wanting to die in this country, chose to hasten her death by stopping eating. 'Debbie rallied against the hypocrisy of the current law, which turns a blind eye to people travelling abroad to die, whilst seeking to protect them by threatening the imprisonment of their loved ones after their death. 'For over a decade Debbie was a huge presence at Dignity in Dying; from stuffing envelopes to leading her legal challenge, she was an integral part of the campaign and a friend. We will miss her greatly.' The group said her victory meant the law was changed so a loved one acting wholly on compassionate grounds and in an amateur capacity is unlikely to be prosecuted for helping a person with a clear and settled intention to die. They said her legacy was one of 'greater clarity in the law and an increased awareness of the need for greater choice at the end of life'. Tory MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted: 'Very sad to hear Debbie Purdy has died. She was a magnificent, tireless campaigner. RIP.' Former attorney general Lord Falconer, whose assisted dying bill is before Parliament, said: ‘Because of Debbie Purdy’s bravery in taking the matter to court when she was ill, people now look at the issue in a completely different way.’ Under the current law, helping someone to take their own life can carry a jail sentence of up to 14 years. Lord Falconer’s bill proposes that doctors should be allowed to prescribe a lethal dose for terminally ill patients who have less than six months to live. An alliance of 80 prominent figures including former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey has called on politicians to debate assisted dying legalisation, saying it would be ‘heartless’ to refuse. Some campaigners have said the proposals do not go far enough as they would not help those like Miss Purdy who have long-term conditions. Critics have voiced fears that the elderly and vulnerable could be put under intolerable pressure to agree to end their lives. Ms Purdy had suffered with primary progressive multiple sclerosis for 20 years at the time of her death . Teacher turned campaigner whose terminal illness plunged her into High Court battle to change law . Ms Purdy was one of Britain's most outspoken activists in the legal battle over assisted suicide . Debbie Purdy was diagnosed with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis in 1995 at the age of 31. She began her legal battle in 2008 by launching a High Court bid to force the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to clarify exactly what actions would lead to a friend or relative being charged under the 1961 Suicide Act. Despite losing the battle and then losing a subsequent Court of Appeal case, she won a legal victory in 2009 when she forced the Department for Public Prosecutions to clarify assisted suicide circumstances, although the law remained unchanged. Ms Purdy's legal victory led to 16 new guidelines on assisted suicide being issued by Keir Starmer QC, the then director of public prosecutions, which clarified what actions would lead to prosecution of those who helped a suicide. He said the motives of those assisting suicide would be at the centre of the decision over whether they should be prosecuted. In 2010 she told an inquiry on assisted dying that if she had not won the backing of the Law Lords she would have gone to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to end her own life as her condition was deteriorating. She had argued that it would be a breach of her human rights if she did not know whether her husband would be prosecuted if he travelled with her to the Swiss clinic. The BBC reports that in December 2013 Ms Purdy entered the Marie Curie hospice in Bradford and decided to try to end her life by refusing food, but the hospice continued to offer it to her. In her final interview with BBC Look North, Ms Purdy said her life was 'unacceptable'. She said: 'It's painful and it's uncomfortable and it's frightening and it's not how I want to live. 'The choice that I make is to die, maybe it's not the choice other people would make, but it's my choice.'

In her blog on the Dignity in Dying website, Ms Purdy wrote: ‘I love my life, but I have always been a fiercely independent woman, and I want to have choice about how and when I die. 'Should living become unbearable to me, I want to be able to ask for, and receive help to die with dignity. 'British law does not allow this, and makes assisting someone to die a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison, so my options are to attempt suicide myself, and risk making matters worse, or to travel to Switzerland to have an assisted death. 'My husband knows that if he was able to help me collect the necessary paperwork and make travel arrangements, I could delay making this decision, maybe forever, and for this reason he is prepared to risk a prison sentence. 'But I do not want Omar or any other person dear to me to be made a criminal for what I see as an act of love and humanity.’","Debbie Purdy has died aged 51 at Marie Curie Hospice in Bradford .

Though Perez is doing better, having moved from a hospital to a rehabilitation center, Perez' medical journey is not over. And his family is left to cover medical expenses and make up for the loss in family income with Perez not working, as he is the main bread winner. 'I just wanted to thank everyone from the bottom of our hearts on behalf of my father and my family,' Perez' 19-year-old daughter Monica wrote on the GoFundMe page. 'Thank everyone for all their support their generosity and loving comments for the family, it means a lot to us to know that we're not alone and that people are willing to give us what little they may have just to help us in this time of need.' Perez' wife Maricela Perez, 39, and Monica have taken on the role of sole-breadwinner with Perez in rehab, still unable to walk.

"The idea that roll-ups are less harmful than ordinary cigarettes is wrong, the Chief Medical Officer has warned . The idea that roll-ups are less harmful than ordinary cigarettes is wrong, the Chief Medical Officer warned last night. Professor Dame Sally Davies warned that both forms of smoking effectively ‘rot’ the body from the inside. She said that contrary to popular belief that roll-ups are natural and less dangerous, the tobacco contains just as many deadly chemicals. Health officials are concerned that roll-ups are becoming increasingly popular amongst smokers who see them as a cheaper alternative to cigarettes. Figures showed that 40 per cent of men and 23 per cent of women smokers use them, up from 18 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in 1990. But 49 per cent mistakenly believe they are less harmful, according to a survey of 627 individuals. The Government is today  launching a new stop-smoking campaign involving a shocking TV advert showing a father-of-two rolling a cigarette – which turns into rotting tissue. Another depicts a smoker inhaling a cigarette and then contaminated black, blood spreading to his lungs, heart and brain. Professor Dame Sally Davies said: ‘While many smokers know the damage cigarettes do to their hearts and lungs, they are much less likely to be aware of how harmful smoking is to the body - essentially ‘rotting’ it from the inside out, and roll-ups are no exception. ‘January is a time when many people make New Year’s resolutions to improve their health and try to stop smoking. ‘Millions of people have used Smokefree support (the NHS’s stop smoking programme) and we are hoping that this year, even more will take advantage of the free expertise and resources on offer.’ Professor Kevin Fenton, National Director for Health and Wellbeing for Public Health England, the Government agency overseeing the campaign said: ‘Much of the harm caused by smoking doesn’t become obvious until middle age but the invisible damage can start shockingly early - even by the late teens. Contrary to popular belief roll-up tobacco contains just as many deadly chemicals as normal cigarettes . ‘The earlier a smoker quits the better, but quitting at any age can help reverse at least some of the damage. That’s why there is no time better than now to quit. ‘Stop smoking and stop the rot.’ Figures show that fewer in one in five Britons smoke, the lowest level in 80 years. Health officials want to bring this down even further and they are concerned that rates are much higher in deprived areas. But Forest, which represents smokers, described the campaign as ‘rotten’, ‘poisonous’ and an ‘abuse of public money’. Simon Clark, the director said: ‘There can't be a sane adult in the United Kingdom who isn't well aware of the health risks of smoking. ‘What's really poisonous is the way public health campaigners are constantly trying to scare and harass people with exaggerated claims and dubious statistics. ‘Campaigns like this are an abuse of public money. Education has been replaced by shrill scaremongering that is often counter-productive because it's human nature to switch off when you're being nagged or shouted at on an almost daily basis. ‘This is real life not a Hammer Horror film.’","Professor Dame Sally Davies warned both forms of smoking 'rot' body .

"Abbie Doughty, 18, won £130,000 on the Bingo after she started playing with her mother in Barrow-in-Furness just weeks ago after she turned 18. A teenager got herself an extra Christmas present when she won the £130,000 jackpot during her fourth game of bingo. Abbie Doughty, of Barrow-in-Furness, only started playing bingo a month ago when her mother Annette Taylor introduced her to her favourite game when she turned 18. But the teenager was shocked when she not only scored a full house, but was also fastest in the country to do so and won with a final number to win the huge jackpot. The 18-year-old initially thought she had won £101 but then saw her prize escalate as she totted up her score at Apollo Bingo and Social Club in Barrow. She described the win as 'like a dream' and said she plans to split her winnings with her mother, who works in a care home. She also plans to give some money to charity. 'Mum and I always split the money 50/50 when we go no matter how much we win,' she said. 'My grandad is sick with cancer so I'm going to give some to a cancer charity and some to a homelessness charity, it's something I don't like to see so I hope I can help.' Miss Doughty said when she called bingo everyone started screaming and shouting but she did not understand why. She added: 'I didn't know what to do, I knew that the full house was for £101 but then the money just kept piling up. 'I got an extra £25,000 for being the first call in the country, meaning I was the first to the full house on the national game. 'Then I found out that I had won on the star number which meant that I won £100,000. 'It was like a dream!' Miss Doughty managed to net the jackpot because she won £101 for calling a full house and was then awarded an extra £25,000 for being the quickest call  in the country that day, completing her card after just 40 numbers were called. She was also extra lucky as she called 'full house' on number 80, which had a star on it. Calling full house on a number marked in this way is known as a 'star number', with the prize building up each day to a maximum £250,000 until someone wins it. When Miss Doughty called full house the prize for the star number had reached £104,000 and the teenager was able to leave with total winnings of £129,419.01 on Sunday evening. She said: 'Everyone was staring at me and I was nervous, I didn't realise what I had done. 'I'm so thankful to mum for asking me to come along now because it's brilliant to have won. Abbie Doughty (right) is pictured with her mother Annette Taylor (left) and will split the money with her . Miss Doughty won the huge £130,000 bingo jackpot at Apollo Bingo and Social Club in Barrow-in-Furness . 'She's really excited too though I think she will just spend her half on the house.' Paul Holland, general manager of the Barrow's Apollo Bingo and Social Club in Hindpool Road, described the atmosphere as 'electric', when the youngster won not only the national full house prize but was the quickest call in the country and also won on the star number. Workers at the Bingo hall said the large win was quite unusual for Barrow. Miss Doughty said she planned to return to the game next week to continue her successful Bingo performance. Miss Doughty said she would also like to donate some of her haul to charity after the unexpected win .","Abbie Doughty started playing bingo with her mother just one month ago .

"Consumers are hot and cross after supermarket giant Woolworths stacked its shelves with an Easter favourite just days after Christmas. Many customers were startled to see hot cross buns at the supermarket on December 27 - some 99 days before Easter. 'Pull your heads in. December is ridiculously early!!!' fumed sports scientist Tim Doyle, who tweeted he would take his hot cross bun purchases to another store's baking aisle. 'I thought it was an urban myth,' wrote a surprised South Australian Federal MP Andrew Southscott on Facebook. 'But Woolies are first off the mark with hot cross buns on the shelf on December 27! Scroll down for video . Not exactly a December favourite: Hot cross buns have already appeared on Woolworths shelves . Woolworths expects to sell more than 50 million hot cross buns in the lead-up to last Easter . While it's not unusual for hot cross buns to appear in stores while Christmas trees are still up, many consumers were stunned by Woolworths' breakneck speed. 'Really Woolworths, hot cross buns in December,'' tweeted mother-of-three Sonya Dunn. 'Unbelievable!' Members of the clergy were quick to join in the condemnation, pointing to the sacred symbol atop the buns. 'It's disappointing,' Uniting Church Reverend Bruce Johnson told Nine News this week. 'They could sell them without the cross on the top and people could buy them all year round'. Even a baker - of all people - urging the supermarkets to restrain themselves. 'I want my children to enjoy the anticipation and excitement that comes from having to wait for something special,' said Steve Plarre, the CEO of the Ferguson Plarre Bakehouse. Coles will roll out their buns in early January. A spokesman said they are a favourite of shoppers, and had a special aside for critics. Christmas favourite: Hot cross buns are a popular buy at both major supermarket . 'Clearly customers who would prefer to wait until Easter before buying buns have that choice,' he told Daily Mail Australia. A Woolworths representative said they release the buns the same time every year. 'Our customers love them,' a spokesman said. They certainly do - the supermarket expects to sell more than 50 million buns in the lead-up to Easter. The grocery giants are far from the only Australian stores to muscle in on big holidays. Several Australian department stores are known to hoist up their Christmas trees in early September, four months before the special day.","Customer fury as Woolworths bring out the hot cross buns months days after Christmas .

"British holidaymakers are planning more city breaks than beach holidays in 2015 as tourists trade sun for sights, new research has revealed. City breaks trumped beach getaways in 2014 and are expected to narrowly hold the top spot next year, according to a travel trends report published by British travel association Abta. The organisation’s research found that 43 per cent of people are planning a city break while 42 per cent are planning a beach holiday. A report from Abta says British holidaymakers are planning more city breaks than beach holidays . City breaks trumped beach getaways in 2014 and the trend is expected to continue next year, says Abta . Source: Abta . Another trend is holidaymakers’ desire to live like a local in search of ‘more authentic’ experiences. Many holiday companies are now offering people the chance to enjoy hidden gems alongside traditional tourist attractions. The report also listed 12 destinations that are expected to emerge in 2015. Austria is at the top of the list, followed by Botswana, Cuba, Dominican Republic and Japan. Abta said British holidaymakers have been playing it safe in recent years, but next year more than a third (35 per cent) think they will travel to a country they have never visited before. The report, produced in association with the Foreign & Commonwealth Office, also found that the ‘destination celebration’ is growing in popularity as more groups travel abroad for weddings, anniversaries and stag and hen trips. Botswana is listed as one of the destinations that is expected to find new popularity in 2015 . Abta said consumer confidence is slowly returning to the holiday market with more consumers planning to spend more on their holidays in 2015 than those looking to cut back. According to a survey of 2,001 Britons, 20 per cent of respondents said they would spend more on trips next year compared to 15 per cent who will spend less. Abta said the growth is being led by more affluent holidaymakers who are taking more holidays, package trips and a desire to maximise leisure time by combining travel with adventure or activity holidays or events. A tourism boom is expected in Cuba after the US announced that it would lift restrictions on travel and trade . Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer: “We do expect to see the slow but steady signs of recovery that have been characteristic of 2014 continue into next year. ‘We are seeing strong growth from the most affluent end of the market and we expect this to drive interest in luxury and tailor made packages. ‘The rest of the market remains resilient with value for money continuing to be a priority. ‘Holidaymakers want their holiday to work hard for them, whether that’s by offering new experiences, combining different destinations or simply delivering great value.’","Trend expected to continue as city breaks trumped beach holidays in 2014 .

"Super-rich investors flocked to auctions this year to make world record purchases on everything from classic cars to embroidery and stamps. With interest rates low and a lack of trust in banks, wealthy people have been looking for ways to get decent returns on their money. As a result, more and more are visiting the likes of Bonhams, Sotheby’s and Christie’s to bid on assets they can enjoy and profit from. High price: 'Still Life, Vase with Daisies and Poppies' was one of only a few Vincent van Gogh pieces to be offered publicly in decades. The 1890 piece, painted shortly before his death, was offered with an estimate of £19million. It ended up selling for £40million, a record for a still life painting by the artist . Tick tock: The Henry Graves Supercomplication, a Patek Philippe watch regarded as the Holy Grail of Timepieces sold for a world record £15.1million at a Sotheby’s sale in November.

It was produced by the Dutch artist in 1890 at the house of his close friend Dr Gachet near Paris - not long before he shot himself with a revolver, aged 37. Van Gogh painted just a few hundred works in his career, the majority of which are now displayed in museums. The artist is believed to have suffered from bipolar disorder, where manic episodes of high energy and creativity succumbed to spells of depression. The painting was seen as particularly poignant because Van Gogh picked the flowers for the picture from the meadows where he is thought to have shot himself the following month. And the classic car dealer expects the ‘crazy’ market to continue and has just taken two 1960s Ferrari prototype race cars into stock - with each model for sale for £15million. He said: ‘In 2008, before the collapse, you were getting £700,000 in interest for every £10million in the bank but that soon disappeared. Now all people want is assets. 'The car and art markets in particular have gone crazy. People are scared of banks. They are scared they could collapse and they would lose their millions so they would rather have assets. ‘A right-hand drive Ferrari 250 Lusso, which is a run-of-the-mill classic Ferrari, has gone from £300,000 to £2.25million since 2007. ‘Ferraris are like then Chanels and Warhols of the car world. 'You might get one person looking at a classic Jaguar, but you’ll have ten looking at each Ferrari. They are the leaders.’ Classic cars aren’t the only ‘boys’ toys’ doing the business at the auction house. The Henry Graves Supercomplication, a Patek Philippe watch regarded as the Holy Grail of Timepieces sold for a world record £15.1million at a Sotheby’s sale in November. This was a £5.5million increase on the £9.6million it sold for in 1999 - itself a world record. Classic: A British car collector paid £6million for Steve McQueen’s old Ferrari 275 GTB. The actor bought the car while filming police drama Bullitt. In the film, his character is followed in his 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback by a black Dodge Charger in one of the best car chase scenes in Hollywood history . Flower: Georgia O’Keeffe’s iconic ‘Jimson Weed’ of 1932 more than tripled the previous record for a female artist when it was sold by Sotheby’s for £28.4million at a New York sale in November . The 1856 British Guiana One-Cent Magenta sold in June in New York, which was the fourth time it had broken the auction record for one stamp in its long history. Measuring 1in-by-1 1/4in, it had not been on public view since 1986 and is the only major stamp absent from the British Royal Family's private Royal Philatelic Collection. The last owner was John E. du Pont, an heir to the du Pont chemical fortune who was convicted of fatally shooting 1984 Olympic champion wrestler David Schultz in 1996. Printed in black on magenta paper, it has the image of a three-masted ship and the colony's motto, in Latin: 'we give and expect in return.' It went into circulation after a shipment of stamps was delayed from London and the postmaster asked printers for the Royal Gazette newspaper in Georgetown in British Guiana to produce three stamps until the shipment arrived: a 1-cent magenta, a 4-cent magenta and a 4-cent blue. While multiple examples of the 4-cent stamps have survived, only the tiny 1-cent issue is known to exist today. Artwork has continued to set records as well. ‘Still Life, Vase with Daisies and Poppies’ was one of only a few Vincent van Gogh pieces to be offered publicly in decades. The 1890 piece, painted shortly before his death, was offered with an estimate of £19million. It ended up selling for £40million, a record for a still life painting by the artist. Poise, a piece by Scottish artist John Duncan Fergusson which was discovered in a French attic, sold for £638,000 at a Christie’s sale - five times its initial estimate. The year of 2014 also saw the emergency of female power players in the art market, according to Sotheby’s, with a surge in appreciation for works by woman. Georgia O’Keeffe’s iconic ‘Jimson Weed’ of 1932 more than tripled the previous record for a female artist when it was sold by Sotheby’s for £28.4million at a New York sale in November. A drawing, by EH Shepard, of Winnie the Pooh sold for £314,500 - three times its estimate and a world record for an illustration when it was auctioned in London earlier this month. In November, a Chinese billionaire paid £28million for a silk embroidery - a world record for any work of Chinese art. The 600-year-old thangka, from the Ming dynasty Yongle period, depicts the majestic Raktayamari, the red Conqueror of Death, embracing his consort, Vajravetali.

She said: ‘He said that he had been on the top deck for the last seven hours with rain, and thunder and lightning, but he was making light of it because he knew I would be so worried. They’ve apparently blocked all people’s mobiles because they thought it was hampering the rescue effort.’ The 70-year-old, from Newbury, Berkshire, added: ‘He called me to let me know that he’s okay and that Regina’s okay.’ Other panic-stricken passengers called TV stations and pleaded for help. Sofoklis Styliaras called Mega TV from his mobile, saying: ‘The fire is still burning. On the lower deck, where the lifeboats are, our shoes were starting to melt...there’s nowhere else for us to go.’ Italian and Greek helicopter crews prepared to work through the night to airlift passengers, who described their shoes melting in the searing heat .

Kali Hardig was diagnosed with the form of parasitic meningitis in July of 2013 as her mother was in the middle of her own health battle, and although it is often fatal l she recovered after being treated at Arkansas Children's Hospital. 'There are no hard feelings,' Traci Hardig said at the time about the water park where her daughter contracted the rare illness. 'They (the water park owners) are just a family, just like us.'

Histopathology of amoebic meningoencephalitis due to Naegleria fowleri . Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific. It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots up their noses. The amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive. It grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees. The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans. Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the last 50 years. Only one person has survived in the United States. One other survivor was found in Mexico . Health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by keeping their heads above water; using nose clips or holding the nose shut when the head is submerged; avoid stirring up sediment in shallow areas.","Kali Hardig contracted the rare infection amoebic meningoencephalitis at a water park in Arkansas and beat it against all odds .

"The New York Jets have fired Rex Ryan, the outspoken and popular coach, the team failed for a fourth year in a row to make the playoffs and ended with a pitiful 4-12 record. Jets owner Woody Johnson also fired General Manager John Idzik, who has also been blamed for the Jets' poor performance in the last two seasons. The Jets were the first team to swing the ax on 'Black Monday' - the day after the final game in the regular season when many teams that missed the playoffs fire coaches, general managers and other staffers. Scroll down for video . Axed: Popular New York Jets coach Rex Ryan lost his job on Monday - a move that was anticipated since early November when the team began the season 1-8 . Gone: Jets owner Woody Johnson fired head coach Ryan (left), as well as John Idzik (right), the team's general manager. The two are pictured on Sunday in Miami at the Jets' final game of the season . On Sunday, it was announced that the San Francisco 49ers and head coach Jim Harbaugh were parting ways. Harbaugh announced he was taking the head coaching job at the University of Michigan for a reported $8million-per-year salary. Late this morning, the Atlanta Falcons fired head coach Mike Smith, who started his six-year tenure by making the playoffs four times in five years, but has fielded losing teams the last two seasons. The Chicago Bears also made big moves - firing head coach Marc Trestman and general manager Phil Emery following a 5-11 season that outraged fans. The year was marked by a woeful performance by quarterback Jay Cutler, whom Trestman and Emery signed to a $126million contract extension last season. The Jets move was widely expected in the football world - anticipated for weeks following the Jets 1-8 start on the season.

Falcons coach Mike Smith was fired after fielding two losing teams in a row following four playoff appearances in five years . Ryan himself even saw it coming, reportedly cleaning out his office this weekend in advance of his final game against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday. The Jets won 37-24. Ryan started off his tenure in New York with a bang - winning two straight division championships in 2009 and 2010, just one game shy of making it to the Super Bowl. The next four seasons saw the Jets drop out of relevance. The team went 8-8 in 2011 and 2013 and had a losing record this season and in 2012. The 2012 season saw one of the lowlights of the Jets franchise, the dreaded 'buttfumble.' Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez ran into the backside of his teammate and fumbled the ball - which was recovered by the New England Patriots for a touchdown. Despite the Jets taking on a hapless reputation in the NFL, Ryan remained popular among his players and most fans. He made headlines in the sports world during his tenure for repeatedly boasting that his teams would win the Super Bowl. 'I believe this is the year we’re going to win the Super Bowl. I thought we’d win it the first two years, but I guarantee you we’ll win it this year,' he crowed in 2011. The team went 8-8 and missed the playoffs that year. Even at the end, when Ryan's fate seemed assured, he managed to maintain the loyalty of his players. Wide receiver Percy Harvin, who has only been with the Jets since October, told the New York Post: 'I love him I loved him before I got here, and I’m that much more in love with him now. That’s what guys are still playing hard for him and giving it their all.

"For most of the past 20 years, a live animal has been used in a small North Carolina town's annual New Year's Eve Possum Drop. But this year, following challenges from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the organizer says he'll no longer use a live opossum - instead, it'll be a road-kill opossum or perhaps a pot of opossum stew. The Brasstown event involves enclosing an opossum in a tinsel-covered plastic box and lowering it to the ground at midnight, then releasing the animal. Scroll down for video .

As many as 3,000 people watch the Possum Drop each year, The Los Angeles Times reported. PETA says the lights, noise and crowd can harm an opossum's nerves and health. 'Even if the animals are released alive, they may die later of ""capture myopathy,"" a cascading series of catastrophic physical reactions to stress or trauma,' the group said in a statement to the newspaper. A judge ruled earlier this month that organizer Clay Logan could use a live opossum if he got a state permit. But Logan says he didn't have time to do so. 'We’ll still do something – maybe some roadkill or a pot of stewed possum,' Logan told The Los Angeles Times. 'Rain, storm, sleet or dark of night will not stop the Possum Drop,' he also said. He says if he doesn't use a road-kill opossum or stew, it'll be something similar. Logan says he used a dead possum once previously because of legal challenges.

Organizer: A judge ruled earlier this month that  Clay Logan, seen here at last year's Possum Drop, could use a live opossum if he got a state permit. Logan says he didn't have time to do do . However, legislation was later passed which said Logan could get a permit if he carried out wildlife captivity criteria, according to the affiliate station. WRAL reported that PETA wanted to quash Logan's 2014 license and also accused him of violating his 2013 license. A May 2014 bill from Rep. Roger West (R-Clay) went through earlier this year and kept Clay County free from possum wildlife laws between December 26 and January 2 annually, the media outlet reported. However, PETA was granted a restraining order earlier this month blocking the move by Super Court Judge Bryan Collins, according to WRAL. Logan wrote in a December 20th letter to Senior Administrative Judge Fred Morrison Jr. that a live possum would not be part of this year's events, the news outlet said. WRAL reported that 'After receiving Logan's letter, Morrison on Monday dismissed PETA's challenge to Logan's license renewal as moot.'

"Model Myla Dalbesio has hit out against the fashion industry’s 'ridiculous' treatment of sizing – and claims that she will no longer try and conform to society’s stereotypes. The 27-year-old, who is a size 10, made headlines in November when she was chosen as the newest face of Calvin Klein’s Perfectly Fit underwear and was described in an interview with Elle.com as the first 'plus size' model to have ever worked with the brand – a label which caused outrage among critics who claimed Myla was 'too thin' to fit the larger stereotype. But now, the model has hit back at her critics, claiming that the fashion industry places too much emphasis on 'ridiculous' labels for women according to their size. Scroll down for video . More than a measurement: Calvin Klein model Myla Dalbesio has slammed 'ridiculous' fashion stereotypes . 'We don't want there to be distinctions and precursors for everyone based on something as arbitrary as the number on the tag of our jeans. Plus size, straight size, in-betweenies. It all sounds so ridiculous,' she said in a new interview with Elle.com. 'I want all women to know, regardless of size, shape, color, whatever, that they are powerful beings. You own your beauty; your body is what you make of it. You can, and should, celebrate it, regardless of whatever size society tells you it's supposed to be.' She added: 'When I stopped the weird diets and essentially rejected what everyone was telling me to do with my body and my life, my whole world changed. I began to respect myself in a different way and to demand that same respect from the people around me. 'I became a whole person again, which made it easier to figure out what I wanted from life and take on the challenges involved in getting there. I am more than a measurement and I want people to know that.' Newfound confidence: 'I began to respect myself in a different way and to demand that same respect from the people around me,' she added . Controversy: Myla's description as 'plus size' in an interview with Elle.com in November set Twitter ablaze with criticism that she wasn't large enough to be categorized as such . Myla called the attention surrounding her Calvin Klein campaign 'surreal' and 'strange'. 'When you're caught up in the middle of a media blitz, it can be terrifying and stressful,' she said. She added that while she felt as though the attention would never end, the quick turnover of today's news cycle means that 'you basically blink and your moment is over'. However, the upside of being thrust into the spotlight was having the opportunity to inspire other women. Positive image: 'I want all women to know, regardless of size, shape, color, whatever, that they are powerful beings,' she said . She received emails and comments from women sharing their own stories about body image, which gave her 'a greater feeling of responsibility' with regard to her career choices. Myla also revealed that she is an artist and is currently working on a series of collages and drawings. 'I'm always in my studio working on something when I'm not traveling,' she said. As for her subject matter, she added: 'The powerful female body is the fundamental base of all the art I make, but size doesn't really play a role.' Media blitz: Myla called the attention surrounding her Calvin Klein campaign 'surreal' and 'strange' Earlier this month, Myla told Yahoo Style that she doesn't think she is large enough to be considered 'plus-size' and admitted that she previously lied about her size and stuffed her clothes in order to secure modeling jobs aimed at bigger women. She said that she has always felt like an 'in-betweener' in the fashion industry, with her figure too large for traditional modeling jobs, but too small for plus-size work. 'You get used to calling yourself a plus-size model when you’re not,' she said. 'It has been hard. I can never figure out where I fit in, and I'm always making someone mad. I'm not skinny-skinny, but I'm not fat and fabulous either. I'm a size 10.'","The 27-year-old rose to fame earlier this year when she became the 'biggest' model to ever feature in a Calvin Klein underwear campaign .

"Cheryl Fernandez-Versini used her return to X Factor this year to make a sartorial statement. After a  four-year hiatus from the talent contest, Cheryl returned to our screens - along with a new surname and whole new look - and successfully stole back her style crown. And now, the singer's efforts have been recognised; she has been crowned biggest Beauty Icon of 2014, usurping the crown from the Duchess of Cambridge, who held the top spot since 2011. Scroll down for video . Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has been voted best beauty icon of 2014, successfully stealing the crown from the Duchess of Cambridge, who held it for three years . Cheryl, who this year made a triumphant return to X Factor and secured her fifth number one single, took 30 per cent of the vote in the poll that tracks celebrity beauty looks. Kate, 32, came a close second, while former Coronation Street star Michelle Keegan, last year’s number two, Holly Wiloughby and Hollywood royalty Angelina Jolie completed the top five. Newly unveiled face of L’Oreal and champion for ageing gracefully, Dame Helen Mirren just missed a place in the top five, while Emma Watson, Beyoncé, Nicole Scherzinger and Jennifer Lawrence rounded off the top ten in the survey of 2,000 British women. The  study saw Pixie Lott waltzing her way into the top 20 for the first time perhaps thanks to her Strictly Come Dancing success. Other stars to appear for the first time this year included X Factor stars Mel B and Fleur East and  YouTube sensation Zoella, who made her debut at number  45. Cheryl beat the Duchess of Cambridge, left, to the top spot and Michelle Keegan, right, came in third place . Movers and shakers on the list include Rihanna, up nine places from last year to number 11, and Kim Kardashian, who leaped ten places to number 14. A spokesperson for Superdrug, which commissioned the annual survey, said: 'What a great year Cheryl has had, newly married, chart-topping hits and now beauty icon of the year. 'Our customers definitely take their cues from Cheryl, she’s a natural beauty not afraid to try the latest beauty trends and always looks completely polished. 'In fact our customers are so inspired by her that her debut perfume, launched earlier this year, has already secured itself as our number three bestselling celebrity scent.' Newly unveiled face of L'Oreal and champion for ageing gracefully, Dame Helen Mirren, left, just missed a place in the top five while Pixie Lott, right, took a place in the top 20 for the first time . So how did Cheryl secure her position? With the help of a carefully curated 'dream team' of experts, that's how. One of the most important members of Cheryl's glam squad is Paul Percival - one half of hair styling power duo, Percy & Reed. Their client list includes Sophie Dahl, actress Diane Kruger, Agyness Deyn, Anna Friel - and now Cheryl. Paul, who also tends to the tresses of Rita Ora and Mark Ronson for their VIP appearances and magazine shoots, worked backstage with the singer every weekend and was on hand between takes. His signature clean, modern style has made him a backstage fashion week favourite and Cheryl - who married husband Jean-Bernard this year - has benefited. Speaking to FEMAIL about working with the pop icon, he said: 'I have worked with Cheryl a few times over the years on different projects. 'We both had big ideas about what we wanted to achieve this season. The main thing was that we wanted to create lots of different looks that were alternative, versatile and cool, rather than the hair being played safe all of the time. It was a really collaborative effort.' Style overhaul: Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has used this year's X Factor to reinvent her style and beauty . Always head of the game trend-wise, Paul and Cheryl championed the sleek ponytail a lot on the show, which, he says, is one of the easiest hair styles to recreate. In terms of big news for 2015, he thinks what he calls ‘Up Cuts’ (similar to the ‘Short and Sharp’ look), will be big news. 'It’s just about creating shorter, sharper detailed silhouettes when putting the hair up,' he said. Paul, who says he aims to create products with personality and a comfortable salon where egos are left at the door, added: ‘Working with Cheryl is such a pleasure. She is never afraid to try new things and it’s a real collaborative partnership.’ 'My favourite thing about working with Cheryl is that she has fantastic eye to detail. Plus, Cheryl knows what she likes and what she doesn’t but she’s fearless when it comes to trying out new styles.' Despite the show finishing, this isn't the end of Cheryl and Paul's creative relationship. He revealed: 'I‘m looking forward to seeing Cheryl’s new music video we just shot. Percy & Reed are also in the process of producing some very exciting new products but it’s a little too early to share yet. Cheryl has  made the transition from Girls Aloud singer, right, to fully-fledged style and beauty icon, left . Cheryl also enlisted the help of make-up artist to the stars, Karin Darnell. Karin, who trained at the London College of Fashion, has worked on editorials for Vogue, Elle, and Vanity Fair, and campaigns for Burberry, Topshop and Marks & Spencer. She has also worked with the Sugababes, Rihanna, Victoria Beckham, and singer Anastacia. Sharing her top tips for achieving Cheryl's look with Yahoo!, Karin suggested going one shade darker with your foundation and apply it with a flat foundation brush. Despite Cheryl's healthy glow, Karin admits she doesn't use bronzer and instead opts for a concealer two or three shades darker than the singer's skintone, which she pats under and on to cheekbones. The beauty buff certainly uses products in unconventional ways. She applies bronzer on the chin to make lips look bigger, uses nude lipsticks as concealers, gold eyeshadow pencils as bronzers and white eyeliners as highlighters. To beat Cheryl's bags and dark circles, Karin uses Vichy Dermablend Ultra Corrective Cream Stick, which she applies in a triangle shape under her eyes. She also swears by applying lipstick before lipliner and to create Cheryl's full but natural brows, she uses a brown pencil from the bottom inner corner of the brow up to the top point, before filling the brows with eyeshadow. Another one of Karin's tricks is to slather Benefit’s Bathina Body Balm on Cheryl's face and Scott Barnes Body Bling in Original over her skin to give her a bronzed glow.

"A multi-millionaire businessman and his family have been left homeless after a fire wrecked their £3.5m mansion. Darren Browne, chief executive and a director of the Pertemps employment group, told how he arrived home from shopping to find his three-storey home by the River Thames in Caversham, Berkshire was alight. The damage at the property, which has five bathrooms, is expected to cost more than £1m to repair. Scroll down for video . The fire which destroyed a three-storey five-bedroom £3.5m mansion in Caversham, home to multi-millionaire businessman Darren Browne . The fire started in a first floor bedroom of the house at around 2.30pm on Sunday afternoon and the damage at the property is expected to cost more than £1m to repair . The three-storey £3.5m mansion on the banks of the River Thames is home to millionaire businessman Darren Browne . Mr Browne's son Conor, had been in the house with his girlfriend and teenage brother Paddy when they spotted the fire starting in a first floor bedroom of the house at around 2.30pm on Sunday afternoon. The 23-year-old dialled 999 to raise the alarm and fled the detached house with the family dogs, Molly and Digger, before calling his father, who had been out shopping with his wife. The large house, which has wooden rafters and is called Caversham Grange, has been home to the family for the last eight years. Mr Browne said: 'Fortunately everyone is okay. The fire ripped through the expensive property, leaving the roof significantly damaged and some of the rooms charred by the large fire . Several rooms in the mansion were damaged by smoke from the blaze while part of the roof of the mansion caved in, littering roof tiles . Darren Browne was born and raised in the Cotswolds. He went to  Burford School in Oxford. Next he decided to go into business, and got his break when he helped launch gadget website www.boysstuff.co.uk. Mr Browne has 25 years experience working in recruitment - also serving as managing director of Hays Information Technology for 10 years and CEO of Servoca Plc, formally Dream Group for nine. He is now chief executive and director of Pertemps, a recruitment agency specialising in permanent and temporary jobs. Mr Browne also holds 20 directorships at companies specialising in recruitment. 'There is substantial damage and significant water damage to the ground floor as well. It is uninhabitable.' A total of six crews of firefighters spent almost 22 hours battling the blaze at the mansion which is on the banks of the River Thames in Reading, Berkshire. Plumes of thick black smoke were seen from across the other side of the River Thames in Tilehurst in Reading. Neighbour Stuart Bartlett, who lives in nearby Grass Hill, spotted the smoke from his own house. 'There was a massive amount of flames going way up into the sky followed by an enormous amount of smoke,' he said. 'It went up very, very quickly. Within half-an-hour the whole thing was in flames,' he said. 'It is unbelievably sad. From the look of it there will be nothing to save. It is dreadful, the family must be heartbroken.' The roof of the property caved in with dislodged tiles scattered across it, whilst the front windows were cracked or smashed in the heat. The first and second floors were heavily smoke damaged and debris from the house can be seen scattered around the garden. Mr Browne, 47, a recruitment specialist, is a self styled entrepreneur and started his business with a gadget website. None of the family were harmed in the fire. Mr Browne's other son Josh, 24, and 22-year-old daughter Maddie were both away when it broke out, but the family's pet rabbit, Dougal was found dead. The father-of-four added: 'We have scattered the children around to grandparents and friends but my wife and I need to find accommodation. 'It is very sad but we feel very lucky that we are all safe. If it had happened at night it could have been a different story. 'We were hoping it was just a small fire, but when we got back we could see the plumes of smoke. 'It is impossible to say how grateful we are to the fire brigade and our neighbours. They have been great.' Mr Browne said he did not know how much the damage would cost and said he was forced to stay in a hotel on Sunday evening. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said that a joint investigation with the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service had been launched although the origin of the fire was not believed to have been suspicious. Caversham Grange, home to Mr Browne and his family, is a large property on the banks of the River Thames and has five bathrooms . Several possessions and items of furniture from the house were seen outside in the family garden, with clothes littering the trees . Firefighters spent more than 22 hours battling the blaze to try and control it, and several rooms were left water logged after the incident . Mr Browne said he was relieved no one was hurt but estimated that the damage done to his mansion could cost more than £1million to repair . The father-of-four said he had hoped to arrive home to see just a small fire but was shocked to see it took hold of the top part of the house . Firefighters were called to the house on Sunday evening, and the only casualty was a rabbit belonging to the family as the dogs also escaped .

The 23-year-old pledged her love for her mother, despite accusations that Raina Thaiday murdered eight children in her home on December 19 . Eight children were murdered in Thaiday’s home in Murray Street, Manoora on December 19. These children include three of Thaiday’s daughters, aged two, 11 and 12; four of her sons, aged five, six, eight and nine, and her 14-year-old niece .

"At first glance, this copper rockfish may not seem out of the ordinary. But the ageing fish does look a little different, after undergoing eye surgery to remove cataracts. Vets in Vancouver carried out the first-of-its-kind surgery at an aquarium to stop the fish being attacked by others. Scroll down for video . Medical eye opener: An ageing copper rockfish has been fitted with a fake eye (pictured) by vets in Vancouver, who carried out the first-of-its-kind surgery to take place at the aquarium to stop the fish being attacked by others . The copper rockfish lives in the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre’s Strait of Georgia exhibit. Like other animals, rockfishes often encounter some health issues as they age, and this particular fish was found to have developed cataracts in its left eye, according to the aquarium’s head veterinarian, Dr Martin Haulena. The fish's damaged eye was replaced with a taxidermy eye for cosmetic reasons, as well as in a bid to keep it alive in an environment where competition is fierce. This is because, without an eye, other fish in the tank would have acted aggressively towards, or 'bullied' the partially blind fish, assuming it to be sick and weak. The fish's damaged eye was replaced with a fake eye for cosmetic reasons, as well as in a bid to keep it alive in an environment where competition is fierce. This image was taken mid-way through the procedure . Copper rockfish are relatively common from the Gulf of Alaska to the Pacific side of the Baja California peninsula. They swim in both deep and shallow waters, from 33 to 160 ft (10 to 183 metres). The fish come in many colours from reddish dark brown with pale copper blotches along the sides, to a light pink/brown with yellow and white mottling. Males are known to mature between three and seven years, while females mature between four and eight years. They give birth to live young after a gestation period of 10 months. The oldest copper rockfish is known to have reached 55 years old, with many living into their 40s. They typically reach a maximum length of 23 inches (58cm) and weigh up to 6lbs (2.7kg). While the cosmetic surgery may keep the creature alive for further years, it is now partially sighted and at a disadvantage to its completely healthy peers. Dr Haulena, and Seattle Aquarium’s head vet, Dr Lesanna Lahner, fitted the new eye to the bone above the fish’s eye socket by sewing it on with nylon sutures, and attaching it with titanium clips. The copper rock fish was anaesthetised for the procedure. Another rockfish - a yellowtail - underwent the same procedure and will soon return to the exhibit. Dr Haulena said in a blog post: ‘Some people don’t realise how much effort we give fish.’ It is perhaps unlikely that the fish would have survived in the wild without medical attention.

"Homeland has continued to ruffle feathers across the globe, after a scene in the season finale sparked outrage in Israel by comparing former prime minister Menachem Begin to a fictional Taliban leader. Just days after the Pakistani government hit out at the U.S. series over its portrayal of the country, Israelis have sharply criticized the television show and demanded an explanation for the comparison. The offending scene involved a conversation between CIA agent Dar Adal and former CIA director Saul Berenson, a Jewish character played by Mandy Patinkin. Scroll down for video . Pakistani officials complained the show, starring Claire Danes (pictured above), depicted Islamabad as a hot-bed for terrorist activity . The pair are discussing the possibility of protecting fictional Afghan Taliban leader, Haissam Haqqani,  in order to ensure that he will not give political asylum to terrorists. Berenson describes Haqqani as a terrorist who 'recently killed 36 Americans'. Adal responds: 'Menachem Begin killed 91 British soldiers at the King David hotel before he became prime minister.' The Homeland CIA agent was referring to a bombing at the King David hotel in Jerusalem in 1946 that was carried out by the Irgun, a right-wing militant Jewish  organization which was headed by Menachem Begin. Herzl Makov, head of the Menachem Begin Heritage Center in Jerusalem told Israeli news site Ynet, that the statement was: 'Slander against Menachem Begin and Israel'. Menachem Begin (right), the commander of the Irgun - a right-wing Jewish extremist group - speaks to activists in 1948. The group was responsible for the attack on the King David Hotel two years earlier. He said: 'To say that Menachem Begin killed? He wasn't there. The underground organization was under his command and he took responsibility. 'Additionally, during the incident, three warnings were given to the British to evacuate the place. The British commander refused.' On July 22, 1946, the King David Hotel in Jerusalem was attacked by right-wing Jewish organization the Irgun. A total of 91 people of various nationalities - including 28 Britons - were killed and 46 injured. The hotel was the site of the central offices of the British Mandatory authorities of Palestine. Bombing is regarded historically as a contributing factor to the British mandate’s decline. The attack remains highly controversial, and there has been heated debate over when warnings were sent and how British authorities responded. Menachem Begin began his political career as head of Irgun, where he was commander from 1943 to 1948. He added: 'Therefore, there is a dramatic difference between the two incidents that were compared. As far as I'm concerned, it is just like saying that they are both terrorists because they wore brown shirts.' The attack on the King David Hotel remains a highly controversial topic, as there has been heated debate over when warnings were sent and how British authorities responded. Menachem Begin began his political career as head of Irgun, where he was commander from 1943 until the group disbanded in 1948. He went on to  become Israel’s sixth prime minister in 1977 and received the Nobel Peace Prize along with Egyptian president Anwar Sadat after an unprecedented peace treaty between the two countries in 1979. The fresh Homeland controversy comes after the Pakistani government hit out at the television series over its portrayal of the country as a safe haven for Islamic terrorists. Diplomats condemned producers for depicting Islamabad, the setting of the show's fourth series, as a 'hellhole' refuge for the Taliban. Complaining to Showtime which airs the Emmy-winning show in the United States, one official described it as a 'disservice to the people of the US'. The fourth series follows Carrie Matheson as she fights terrorism on behalf of the CIA in Islamabad . The Homeland CIA agent was referring to a bombing at the King David hotel in Jerusalem in 1946 that was carried out by the Irgun, a right-wing militant Jewish organization which was headed by Menachem Begin . The fourth series of the popular show sees star Claire Danes acting as a member of the Central Intelligence Agency in Islamabad. Filmed in fact in Cape Town, the first episode sees a violent mob of local people beating another agent to death over a drone strike which killed a sought-after terrorist hiding in a rural farmhouse. 'Maligning a country that has been a close partner and ally of the US... is a disservice not only to the security interests of the US but also to the people of the US,' Pakistan Embassy spokesman Nadeem Hotiana told the New York Post. The Pakistani directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence has been widely accused of hosting and assisting terrorist activity in the past. Based in Islamabad, doubt was cast over the ISI in 2011 upon the news of Osama Bin Laden's execution by U.S. forces. How, it was asked, could the government not have known the world's most wanted terrorist was taking refuge in a rural compound some 30 miles from its headquarters? Following his assassination, Adm Mike Mullen, then the most senior U.S. military officer, said Pakistan had a 'long-standing relationship' with Afghan insurgents. It has been claimed the directorate differentiates between terrorists committed to corrupting Pakistan and those whose interest lie abroad, with Afghan officials describing the country's handling of terrorism as 'double gamed'. In September a new chief was appointed to lead the ISI, Rizwan Akhtar. 'Islamabad is a quiet, picturesque city with beautiful mountains and lush greenery. 'In Homeland it's portrayed as a grimy hellhole and war zone where shootouts and bombs go off with dead bodies scattered around. Nothing is further from the truth,' another added. 'Repeated insinuations that an intelligence agency of Pakistan is complicit in protecting the terrorists... is not only absurd but also an insult to the ultimate sacrifices of the thousands of Pakistani security personnel in the war against terrorism.' This week the Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif spoke of the country's need to persecute terrorists following an attack on a school in Peshawar which saw Taliban fundamentalists massacre 132 children. Describing the incident as a 'national tragedy', he lifted a moratorium on the death penalty as a result of the attack. In previous years however the government has been widely accused of colluding with terrorists in recent years, with repeated claims officials helped 9/11 orchestrator Osama Bin Laden evade capture. Among those convinced the country had a hand in protecting the terrorist is Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Carlotta Gall who spent more than a decade reporting in Pakistan. 'Pakistan did know. They were hiding him, they were handling him. Someone on the inside told me this,' she told ABC news this year. Upon news of the terrorist's death in 2011, a Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman confirmed the killing but, unlike foreign counterparts, offered no congratulation to U.S forces. 'In an intelligence driven operation, Osama bin Laden was killed in the surroundings of Abbotabad in the early hours of this morning. 'This operation was conducted by the U.S. forces in accordance with declared U.S. policy that Osama bin Laden will be eliminated in a direct action by the U.S. forces, wherever found in the world,' a statement said. Menachem Begin  went on to become Israel’s sixth prime minister in 1977 and received the Nobel Peace Prize along with Egyptian president Anwar Sadat after an unprecedented peace treaty between the two countries . In 2012, a leaked NATO report revealed concerns officials had been assisting the Taliban from the heart of Islamabad. Among testimonies given by al-Qaeda and Taliban detainees in thousands of interviews, one senior fanatic condemned: 'Pakistan knows everything. They control everything. 'The Taliban are not Islam. The Taliban are Islamabad.' Speaking of the report at the time, then Pentagon spokesman Captain John Kirby said: 'We have long been concerned about ties between elements of the ISI [Pakistan's intelligence service] and some extremist networks.' Pakistani government officials dismissed detainees' claims as 'ridiculous' at the time.

"It is the most remote zoo known to man. Orbiting 340km above Earth, the tiny enclosures contain 46 species of bacteria, fungi and arthropods. Strapped to the outside of the International space stations, residents must deal with temperatures ranging from -12C to 40C several times a day - as well as huge amounts of radiation. The Expose-2 experiment on the International Space Station, which is home to 46 ddifferenttypes of bacteria, fungi and arthropods . The vacuum of space is sucking out the water, oxygen and other gases in the samples. Their temperature can drop to –12°C as the Station passes through Earth's shadow, rising to 40°C at other times, and undergoing a similar process to the freeze-drying used to preserve foods. 'As you celebrate the end of the year in the warmth of your home, spare a thought for the organisms riding with a third-class ticket on the International Space Station – bolted to the outside with no protection against open space,' the European Space Agency, which runs the experiment, said. As part of ESA's Expose-R2 project, 46 species of bacteria, fungi and arthropods were delivered by a Progress supply ship to the Station in July. Spacewalking cosmonauts Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Artemyev attached the package to the outside of the Zvezda module on 18 August, where it will stay for 18 months. The vacuum of space is sucking out the water, oxygen and other gases in the samples. Their temperature can drop to –12°C as the Station passes through Earth's shadow, rising to 40°C at other times, and undergoing a similar process to the freeze-drying used to preserve foods. The Expose experiments are exploring the limits of terrestrial life, whether the organisms can survive in space and how the full blast of solar radiation is affecting accompanying chemicals. Earth is protected from the Sun's full radiation by our atmosphere filtering out the hard-hitting short wavelengths that are damaging to life. It is difficult to recreate on the ground the full spectrum of the Sun's light so these experiments in space are the only way to test how biological and material samples behave in conditions beyond Earth. ESA has a long history of testing organisms and organic chemicals in the harsh environment of space. Previous experiments revealed that lichens and water bears can survive spaceflight unprotected, hinting at the possibility of species colonising planets via meteoroids. Expose has special compartments that recreate the martian atmosphere by filtering some sunlight and retaining some pressure. 46 species of bacteria, fungi and arthropods are inside the experiment. They include bacteria, archaea, algae, fungi, lichens and mosses. Replicate samples spread across the compartments are subjected to a range of environmental conditions such as a Martian atmosphere. Not every sample is suffering the same level of discomfort on its epic ride in space. Expose has special compartments that recreate the Martian atmosphere by filtering some sunlight and retaining some pressure. René Demets, ESA's project scientist for Expose, said: 'The Martian sections allow us to investigate to what extent terrestrial life can cope with the extreme conditions on the Red Planet. 'We hope they will contribute to the discussion about the possibility of life on Mars.' All the samples are stored in duplicate or even triplicate to strengthen the scientific results when the three trays are returned to Earth in early 2016 for analysis. The experiment contains numerous chambers that are filled with biomolecules and organisms that include bacteria, archaea, algae, fungi, lichens and mosses. Some samples of each biomolecule or organism are embedded in a simulant Mars soil (ranging from just a single layer of soil to multiple layers), and other samples are left on their own to face the space environment without protection. Various filters are also being used on the sample chambers to test exposure to different levels of radiation. By doing this, scientists are able to simulate the solar radiation present at the Martian surface .

"Kathleen Danby, 72, was sentenced in her absence to three months in jail by the secretive Court of Protection in April after a judge heard she embraced the vulnerable girl, 19, against the wishes of social services . A grandmother was hauled out of a comedy show and arrested on the orders of a family court judge – simply for hugging her granddaughter. Kathleen Danby, 72, was sentenced in her absence to three months in jail by the secretive Court of Protection in April after a judge heard she embraced the vulnerable girl, 19, against the wishes of social services and in breach of a court order. In an extraordinary move, she was arrested on Sunday night as she watched the comedian Ken Dodd at Liverpool Philharmonic Hall. Last night the grandmother was being held in custody, police confirmed. She is expected to be taken to court this morning. The girl’s father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has condemned her arrest as ‘absolutely ridiculous’. The 37-year-old handyman said: ‘She was sat there in the concert. The usher came down and said there were people wanting to speak to her. When she got into the foyer there were two police officers and she was arrested. ‘She’s told me she’s going to fight this but I’m concerned for her in custody. 'I don’t know what’s going to happen. She’s got a liver disease so she’s constantly on medication and she was totally knackered. I’m very angry.’ According to Mrs Danby, the girl was moved into care in Derbyshire in 2007 when she was 11, a year after being taken away from her father in Orkney by social services, on what she called a ‘spurious excuse’. He was banned from seeing her after he was convicted of ill-treatment for restraining her from running into a busy road while she was having a temper tantrum, she said. She revealed that her son had been jailed twice for trying to contact his daughter – once for waving at her taxi as she travelled to school. He told the Mail that he faces 18 months in prison if he leaves Orkney as there is currently a warrant out for his arrest for speaking to his daughter following a court hearing in Derby last year. And under a draconian judgment kept secret from the public, Mrs Danby was banned from making contact with the girl, who has learning difficulties, apart from a monthly telephone call monitored by social services. In February she was accused of disobeying court orders after social workers discovered that she had met her granddaughter at a model railway exhibition, and was caught on CCTV four days later giving her a hug outside a pub. Speaking to the Mail from her home in Kirkwall, Orkney, in June, she insisted that her granddaughter wanted to have a relationship with both her and her son, and revealed that she had run away from care more than 170 times. She added: ‘My granddaughter behaves like a younger child, but she is lucid in what she wants. She can decide for herself what she wants to do.’ However Judge Martin Cardinal said the teenager, named in court only as B, finds it hard to control her anger and has self-harmed. Kathleen Danby with her granddaughter (right) and unnamed grandchild (left). Last night the grandmother was being held in custody, police confirmed. She is expected to be taken to court this morning . He explained that social workers think her distress increases after contact with her father or grandmother, adding: ‘I am sure this grandmother needs restraint.’ Judge Cardinal ordered Mrs Danby to be jailed for three months for contempt and issued the warrant for her arrest. The same judge jailed Wanda Maddocks in secret in September 2012 for trying to free her 80-year-old father from a care home where she feared his life was at risk, without publishing her name. She served six weeks in jail. The case came to light more than six months later and led to new rules stopping anyone from being imprisoned without their name being published. In an extraordinary move, she was arrested on Sunday night as she watched the comedian Ken Dodd at Liverpool Philharmonic Hall . Eamonn Kelly, from False Allegations Action Scotland, described Mrs Danby’s case as ‘one of the most disturbing’ he had encountered. He said: ‘I must have dealt with nearly 200 cases and this is by far one of the most horrific. It is heart-breaking to see what they are doing to that girl.’ Lib Dem MP John Hemming said: ‘I will be asking questions of the Justice Secretary as to whether this is appropriate. There is no question that there is a big problem involving the prosecution of people in secret. ‘And I worry about the way speech is monitored between members of the family. There is no freedom of speech when social services are involved.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Kathleen Danby, 72, was sentenced in her absence to three months in jail .

"Shoppers are deserting sales after complaining that bargains have run out at some of Britain's biggest retailers. Hundreds of bargain-hunters have fumed on social media about cut-price items selling out at John Lewis, M&S, House of Fraser, Selfridges, Debenhams and Zara. They were also left frustrated when the Asos website and mobile apps suffered a technical meltdown yesterday and were unable to handle orders for several hours. This comes after a disappointing 12.4 per cent sale slump on Boxing Day which saw a million fewer shoppers turn out compared to last year after more than a month of heavy promotions. Hundreds of bargain-hunters have fumed on social media about cut-price items selling out, pictured are shopping scrambling for perfume on Boxing Day . Takings hit £3.1billion on Saturday but are expected to be just £2.1billion today and down to £1.5billion tomorrow. Retailers were hoping that 'armchair shoppers' would be enough to make up for a fall in visitors to the high street over the weekend, but experts say the lack of bargains means that spending is plummeting. Professor Joshua Bamfield from the Centre for Retail Research, said: 'Shoppers are saying they've had enough. Retailers kept stocks pretty low. It's not like ten years ago when there were plenty of bargains left days into sales.' Beth Johnson from Sutton tweeted: 'Everything I want from house of Fraser and Selfridges sale is sold out.' Mark Tugwell said: 'Literally everything I want on the Selfridges online sale is sold out.' Yasmine Choudhry tweeted: 'I am housebound and everything I wanted at John Lewis beauty products all sold out. Happened last year too.' Molly Davenport ‏tweeted: 'Everything i want from Zara is sold out :(' Kelly Hurn ‏said: 'Gutted the #benefitcosmetics set I ordered from @Debenhams is out of stock and delivery will be unfulfilled x boo.' Richard Perks, director of retail research at Mintel, said: 'Sales tail off pretty quickly if bargains are not available, Shoppers do not buy from the store concerned.' Buchanan Street in Glasgow was remarkably quiet on Boxing Day morning with millions opting to do their shopping online . Railings were put up outside Selfridges with security standing guard as the first shoppers began queuing overnight ahead of Boxing Day . On one of the busiest days for online shopping after Christmas, fashion retailer Asos struggled to cope and left would-be customers in the dark for hours as it failed to provide information about the problems via its social media channels. Although the website was open for browsing, and continued to promote Asos's 50pc off sale, those who tried to buy items were met with a message saying 'we can't find that page or something has gone wrong'. Frustrated online shoppers bombarded Asos's Twitter account with criticism throughout Sunday. Sarah Attoe tweeted: 'I've been trying to buy 2 skirts on @ASOS since 11am. SO INFURIATING!!! Keep getting slow website and app doesnt work on android.' Jayna Rana said: 'Been trying to pay for my basket on @ASOS for over an hour but the website keeps crashing. I just want my bag and dress.' A spokesman for Asos, whose main warehouse in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was damaged by fire in June, said: 'These things happen from time to time. The site is now back up and running.' Eager shoppers queued through the night at stores across the country, including outside Selfridges in Manchester, to make the most of the Boxing Day sales . Debenhams' and Sainsbury's websites also suffered meltdowns over the Christmas period while Waitrose had a 'temporary IT problem' that resulted in customers experiencing delays in their orders. The number of customers visiting the high street, retail parks and shopping centres dropped by 8 per cent on Saturday compared with the same day a year earlier. Figures from Postcode Anywhere revealed that  web sales had picked up some of the slack, but it had not been enough to beat the success of Black Friday on November 28. There were 28 per cent more online transactions yesterday than there were last year, and there were 47 per cent more transactions on this Boxing Day compared with 2013. Black Friday shopping frenzy was the busiest shopping day on record  and yesterday's online shopping activity was only 29 per cent of the volume experienced that day.","Bargain-hunters fumed on Twitter saying cut-price items have sold out .

"It is one of Britain's greatest architectural masterpieces and these stunning photos give a rare glimpse inside the 150-year-old Clifton Suspension Bridge. The iconic bridge, stretched 245 feet above the River Avon to link Bristol with Somerset, reached its landmark birthday this month. And to celebrate, photographer Jon Rowley was granted rare access to the magnificent structure that Isambard Kingdom Brunel referred to as 'my first child, my darling'. Scroll down for video . Photographer Jon Rowley was given rare access to the Leigh Woods Tower of the Clifton Suspension Bridge . Detail of the giant rollers that the chains rest on  allowing them miniscule movement when loads pass over the bridge .

Detail of the giant cradle that the chains rest on. The slight movement of the chains absorbs forces created by chain deflection prevents and damage to both tower and chain as heavy loads pass over the bridge . Jon captured images from inside the 110ft-high Leigh Woods tower and the stunning views across Bristol and the surrounding countryside. In 2002 it was discovered that the abutment on which the tower stands was not a solid structure but contained 12 vaulted chambers up to 35 feet high, linked by shafts and tunnels. Roller-mounted 'saddles' at the top of each tower allow movement of the chains when loads pass over the bridge. Though their total travel is minuscule, their ability to absorb forces created by chain deflection prevents damage to both tower and chain. The view from the very top of the Leigh Woods Tower shows the spectacular scenery around the bridge which Brunel described as 'my first child, my darling' Jon Rowley was given the rare access to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the bridge, which was marked with a fireworks display on December 8 . David Anderson, Bridge Master of Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, looks out across the bridge from the top of the Leigh Woods Tower . The view from the South side of Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge from the Leigh Woods Tower gives a new perspective of the iconic bridge . The bridge, which spans the Avon Gorge, opened to the public on December 8, 1864 and is regarded as  Brunel’s finest achievement. Plans for a bridge go back as far as 1754 when Bristol wine merchant William Vick left £1,000 in his will to the Society of Merchant Venturers, requesting £10,000 was raised to build a bridge to the city. However, war with France stalled the idea of a grand bridge, built tall enough so that ships could pass underneath, and it was not until the 1820s that it was resuscitated. Completed in 1864, the majestic Clifton Suspension bridge is a testament to the ingenuity of Victorian engineering. It was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel who was only 24 years old when he won the commission to build the incredible structure. The majority of the weight of the bridge is supported by its two major towers; Leigh Woods tower and the Clifton tower. As compression pushes down on Clifton Bridge’s deck, the chains transfer that compression to the towers. The towers then dissipate the compression directly into the ground. The bridge has three independent wrought iron chains on each side, from which the bridge deck is suspended by 81 matching vertical iron rods ranging from 65ft (20 metres) at the ends to 3ft (0.91 metres) in the centre. Roller-mounted ‘saddles’ at the top of each tower allow movement of the chains when loads pass over the bridge, to help absorb forces and prevent damage to the structure. The supporting cables deal with the bridge's tension forces. These cables run horizontally between the bridges anchorages, which pass the tension forces to the rock below. Timber sleepers overlaid with planking make up the deck of the bridge, which has been covered with asphalt since 1897. The bridge is made up of 3,500 load bearing bolts and huge chains that stretch 20 miles (32km) underground. Of the 4,200 links in the iron chains which hold the 1,500-ton structure together, 4,199 are Victorian originals. Overall, it spans 700ft (210 metres) and sits 245ft (75 metres) above the water below at high tide. By 1829, £8,000 had been secured and a competition was announced for engineers to submit their designs for a bridge across the gorge. The competition was to be judged by Menai Bridge designer Thomas Telford, but he rejected all entries - including Brunel's - and submitted his own plans. However, locals were not impressed by Telfords plans and the whole project stalled. A year later a new competition was held and Brunel, who was just 24 at the time, was declared the winner and appointed project engineer for a fee of 2,000 guineas. Work was painfully slow and expensive and became surplus to requirement when another bridge was opened so the project was abandoned in 1853. The spectacular photos, taken from the top of the tower, gove a new perspective on the iconic Grade 1-listed bridge . The 85-foot-tall Leigh Woods tower stands atop a 110-foot red sandstone-clad abutment and gives a view over the whole bridge . But Brunel's death in 1859, aged just 53, prompted the Institution of Civil Engineers to restart the project to commemorate their hero. They purchased chain links form the Hungerford Bridge in London, another Brunel project which was being dismantled, and used them to complete the Cliftonproject. The link, purchased for £5,000, were even transported to Bristol on Brunel's Great Western Railway. By November 1864, the bridge was ready and workmen tested t by dumping 500 tons of rock on the central section to see if it would hold. The rare images celebrate what is one of Britain's most iconic architectural masterpieces, and 34 years in the making . Isambard Thomas, Brunel's great great grandson visits the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol as the structure marks its 150th anniversary . Brunel first won the competition to build the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol in 1830, but it was not completed until 34 years later . After being abandoned in 1853, the bridge project was restarted following Brunel's death and completed in 1864 . Archive photo of the building of the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol in the 1860s shows the iconic bridge near completion . The bridge dipped seven inches under the weight, but returned to its former state once they were removed, declaring the engineering feat a success. A century and a half later, the bridge still draws half a million visitors a year to marvel at the engineering wonder. And the Grade I listed structure is used daily with more than 8,000 motorists crossing the bridge every day. Thousands of people once again flocked to the bridge earlier this month to watch a dazzling fireworks display to celebrate its 150th anniversary on December 8.","Photographer Jon Rowley was give access to bridge's 110ft-high Leigh Woods tower .
