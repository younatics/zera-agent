"A former crime scene investigator at the centre of a major police watchdog inquiry into sub-standard work had been employed by two forces for 15 years up until his arrest. Stephen Beattie, who worked as a scenes-of-crime officer, was arrested last year on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and theft and was released on bail pending further enquiries. The inquiry was launched by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) over allegations that he potentially undermined dozens of criminal cases. Hunting for evidence: Police forensic officers at work at a crime scene in Faversham, Kent (file picture) The watchdog said it is managing an . investigation into the 'quality of work and qualifications' of the . 48-year-old who was employed by both Staffordshire Police and Cleveland . Police as a civilian member of staff between 1996 and 2011. Senior detectives are now reviewing at least 90 cases involving the married 48-year-old which date back over the last decade. The majority of the cases relate to suspicious or sudden deaths and could have resulted in several miscarriages of justice, police confirmed. One investigation, involving a sudden death, has already been reopened by detectives and there are fears others will begin to unravel. By the time Beattie was arrested in May last year, he was crime scene manager for Cleveland Police. Vital link in investigations: A team of forensic officers comb a crime scene for clues (file picture) Steve Matthews, Chairman of the . Cleveland Police Federation, said: 'My concern is that the police . officers I represent have gone through a great deal of time and effort . to investigate and convict people. These cases could unravel because of . this. 'I would also hate to . see innocent people in prison who should not have been convicted or . those whose convictions may be rendered unsafe.' All . those affected have been informed of Beattie's arrest in writing and . are being kept informed of the investigation's progress. Beattie worked for Staffordshire . Police from 1996 to 2002, Northumbria Police for a short period in 2002 . and Cleveland Police from 2002 to 2011. He was suspended in February 2011 and arrested in May. An investigation was then launched by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the three forces involved. Both Staffordshire and Northumbria police forces conducted a review of his work and identified no cause for concern. But an internal review of his work by Cleveland Police highlighted 120 suspicious cases. The force has since narrowed that number down to focus on 90 but has admitted there could be more. It has set up a special phone line to address the concerns of other people they have not yet been in touch with. Detective Inspector Warren Shepheard, from Cleveland Police's investigation team, said: 'Our priority has been to identify whether there have been any issues of concern about the man's work on the incidents he attended during his time with Cleveland Police.' Staffordshire Police said it had submitted an investigation report, which is currently being considered by the IPCC. IPCC Commissioner Nicholas Long said: 'The allegations are serious and had the potential to impact a large number of investigations. 'The number has been narrowed significantly by the work already undertaken. As this remains a criminal investigation we do not intend to go into specific detail about cases at this stage.' The hotline set up by Cleveland Police is 01642 301677.

"The big freeze will turn into a deep freeze tomorrow as temperatures hurtle down to -8C (18F) in parts of rural Britain. It came as forecasters put out weather warnings for ice and snow across the country, predicting the arrival of snow in London, Surrey and Hampshire by Thursday. Residents affected by last week’s floods were also warned to expect around an inch of rain.Some 40 flood alerts were issued for the South East and South West alone. Scroll down for video . Festive scene: A flurry of snow hits the north-east of Scotland on the A957 in Aberdeenshire, with freezing conditions making driving hazardous across the country . Chill in the air: A high pressure front moving from Siberia into Scandinavia, and then ridging westwards, can give the British Isles a bitter easterly airflow . Sarah Holland, a Met Office . forecaster, said: ‘There are going to be some snow showers around the . east coast tomorrow, possibly up to an inch or two in places. ‘We could also see some snow flurries and wintry showers over northern . parts of England and Wales. 'Temperatures will only get up to about 3C . (37F) and we also have a big ice warning for Wales and the South East. ‘We also have a band of rain moving in from the South West bringing up to 25mm (nearly an inch) in a short, sharp burst. ‘After the recent heavy rain there is a chance we could see some . localised flooding and potentially hazardous driving conditions. ‘There will be widespread frosts and in the Midlands we could see . temperatures dip to possibly -8C (18F) in rural locations overnight.’ Many believe Britain could be heading towards one of the coldest winters . on record. The conditions are being put down to high pressure over Scandinavia, which has seen cold air tearing over Britain from the north-east and raising hopes for a white Christmas. Shovelling snow: Adam Middler clears the street outside his house Huntly, Aberdeenshire . Take care: Snow and rain has turned to slush, adding to the perilous conditions on the roads . The Big . Freeze that heralded the start of December is set to continue, with . sleet, snow and hail covering much of the country all week. The . cold snap will persist, with temperatures dropping to a . lower-than-average -8C in Scotland and four inches of snow expected . tomorrow, and another four inches likely later in the week. High pressure in Scandinavia can . indicate one of the most well-known snow setups, in which the pressure . front moves from Siberia into Scandinavia, and then ridges westwards, . giving the British Isles a chilly easterly airflow. Continental air from Russia is very cold and dry, but as this air passes over the North Sea, it warms up and picks up moisture. This . gives rise to layers of grey cloud and mostly dull dry weather, with a . little drizzle or fine powdery snow for eastern areas. When . the high pressure to our north is not particularly strong, or the . airmass has a long track over the North Sea, or there is a strong . contrast between surface and upper-air temperatures, there may be enough . instability in the atmosphere to produce cumulonimbus clouds. These can give rise to heavy prolonged snow showers for eastern Britain, and snow flurries for western Britain. BBC weather forecaster Chris Fawkes tweeted today: 'I spy with my little eye Scandinavian high. Ecmwf [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts] forecast middle of December could bring us really bitter snowy weather....fingers crossed!'

"Surrounded by 25 acres of parkland and boasting its own clock tower, stables and servants’ quarters, Windlestone Hall was expected to attract offers of more than £2million. But six years after it first went on the market the birthplace of former prime minister Sir Anthony Eden has gone for just a fraction of its original valuation and sold for just £241,000. The extraordinary drop in price belies its great history and grandeur and makes it one of the most spectacular property bargains in recent years. Piece of history: Windlestone Hall is thought to have been valued at nearly £2million just a few years ago . Sign of distinction: The 19th-century clocktower would have been in place when former Prime Minister Anthony Eden was born here . Deserted for years: The house has not been used since 2003, when a local authority school moved out because it needed major repairs . Elegant decor: One of several ornate ceilings within the beautiful building . In 2010, English Heritage refused the proposals by a developer who wanted to build luxury homes on the site . Opulent fashion: Classical mouldings shaped like swirling leaves and baskets of flowers decorate walls and ceilings throughout the mansion . Last night, its new owners, who have chosen to remain anonymous, vowed: ‘It is a private home which is going to be renovated back to its original splendour.’ But not everyone was as pleased to see the sale go through. The local council, which owns and sold the grade-II listed country pile, has been accused of ‘frittering’ away money amid claims that one prospective buyer offered £1.5million for the property. The claims, which have been denied by the council, means the property could have been under-sold by £1.25million. The charming house features grand staircases, Doric order columns and 12 bay windows at the front . Generations of happy families: Hall as viewed from the former pleasure gardens with the clocktower in the background . The Hall has a billiard room, a library with a dummy bookcase leading to its gallery and a drawing room . Affluent past: Staff quarters and a stable are situated in the extensive grounds . Born at the hall: Anthony Eden was born at Windlestone in 1897, before going on to become Conservative Prime Minister in the fifties . And while the picturesque home, located . near the County Durham village of Rushyford, is said to need urgent . repairs costing an estimated £3million one critic insisted the council . had still sold it far too cheaply. County Councillor John Shuttleworth said: ‘The property was on the market for a figure approaching £2million in 2007. ‘The council was offered £1.5million in the same year, but they turned this offer down. It is a massive, massive property, with ornate period features. ‘Even in today’s climate the land itself should be worth at least £4,000 an acre making the parkland alone worth £100,000. I think the sale for this price is totally wrong.’ The 19th century hall was first built in 1835, incorporating a section of the rear wing which dated back to 1750. Designed by architect Ignatius Bonomi and built for Robert Thompson Eden, the property was the 1897 birthplace of the former Tory prime minister Sir Anthony Eden who led the country between 1955 and 1957. His family sold the hall in the 1920s and it was later used as a prisoner of war camp before becoming a school for youngsters with emotional and behavioural difficulties . Gorgeous setting: Windlestone lies within 25 acres of lush parkland . Grand interior: The hall boasts a library with dummy bookshelf, many original staircases and fireplaces - but needs major repairs . Upstairs downstairs: The northern elevation of the former staff accommodation . Glorious countryside: An earlier prospective buyer wanted to build luxury flats on the site - but the new owners intend to restore the home to its former splendour . Enduring designs: Map showing the listed buildings in and around the 19th-century home . But following the need for extensive . repairs the school relocated several years ago to a purpose-built site . two miles away, leaving the hall empty. In 2006 Durham County Council, faced . with an £81,000 annual bill to maintain the hall, decided to sell up to a . property developer who planned to turn the hall into luxury flats. 'As the hall is a grade II* listed building, we were obliged by law to protect and maintain it while it was under our ownership. However, the proposals were  rejected by English Heritage. After the deal fell through the council began looking at alternative options when it received an expression of interest which finally led to its sale. The U-shaped home has a billiard room, a library with a dummy bookcase leading to its gallery, stables, separate staff quarters and many original marble fireplaces. A spokesman for English Heritage said it was of the ‘most historically significant buildings in the North East’, adding: ‘We are pleased new owners have been found and look forward to working with them and the council.’ From Baronets to blackboards: An extension was added on to Windlestone when parts of it became a school between 1957 and 2003 . Windlestone Hall was built in 1835 and instantly became one of the region's grandest stately homes. It was commissioned by Baronet Robert Johnson . Eden, to replace his 16th-century manor, and designed by architect Ignatius Bonomi. On . the death of the fifth Baronet in 1844, the estate and Baronetcy passed . to his cousin, Sir William Eden, the fourth Eden of Maryland Baronet, who became High Sheriff of Durham in 1848. Anthony Eden was born there in 1897 and later served as a cabinet minister before becoming prime minister from 1955 to 1957. The estate was then used as a prisoner of war camp for female German prisoners during the Second World War. Afterwards it was adapted by the council to serve as a school for youngsters with emotional and behavioural difficulties for nearly 50 years, between 1957 and 2006. Windlestone Hall School added an unlisted extension to the building in the seventies, but was forced to relocate several years ago after the hall fell into disrepair. A buyer then became interested in developing the land for luxury flats, but the deal fell through and the house has only now been sold to an unnamed buyer, who plans to restore it to its former splendour.","The 25-acre grounds contain stables and staff quarters .

"Out of the running? The Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu was the favourite to become the next Archbishop of Canterbury, but two other candidates are also now being considered . The search for the next Archbishop of Canterbury could take months amid claims that the secretive panel choosing a successor is divided. Dr John Sentamu, Archbishop of York, was originally the hot favourite to take over from Dr Rowan Williams when he officially steps down in December. But the Crown Nominations Commission is said to be split over the 63-year-old’s suitability after three days of deliberations ended in deadlock at the end of last week. While it narrowed the field to a shortlist of three, including Dr  Sentamu, there is a growing belief that the Ugandan-born traditionalist will not get the job. Sources said that while popular and charismatic, he may lack  the diplomatic skills needed for  Lambeth Palace. The 16-strong panel is now torn between him and two other candidates, 56-year-old Dr Justin Welby, Bishop of Durham, and 61-year-old Dr Graham James, Bishop of Norwich, who last week said he was ‘praying not to be chosen’. One Church insider said: ‘Bishop Welby is seen as too conservative and too inexperienced and  Bishop James as too liberal and too dull. There is no outstanding candidate.’ Sources said the CNC, which consists of clergy and lay people, does not have to work to a specific timetable and that it could be months before a decision is reached. A senior cleric said: ‘The whole thing has become a farce. One minute it is compared to a horse race. The next no one can find a winner. ‘We need to have a much more transparent and representative process.’ Lacking diplomacy? Dr Sentamu with The Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, who will officially step down in December . Other contenders for the post included Dr Richard Chartres, Bishop of London, who is a friend of Prince Charles, and Dr Christopher Cocksworth, the Bishop  of Coventry. The choice of a replacement for Dr Williams is seen as critical for a Church in danger of splitting over issues such as gay marriage and women bishops. Dr Williams, 62, has said that his successor would need the ‘constitution of an ox and the skin of a rhinoceros’. The Church of England said: ‘The work of the Commission continues. There will be no comment on any speculation about candidates or about the CNC’s deliberations.’","Archbishop of York was frontrunner to succeed Dr Rowan Williams .
But there are now fears he may lack necessary diplomacy ."
"Off duty: Stephanie Houghton showing her glamorous side when not playing for Arsenal Ladies . While Premier League stars park their supercars outside multi-million-pound mansions, Stephanie Houghton earns just £16,000 a year, shares a house with three girls and drives a Vauxhall Corsa. But the new sensation of women’s football is too busy enjoying her sport to be envious of her cosseted male counterparts. ‘The money doesn’t bother me – I just want to play football,’ the blonde 24-year-old told the Mail. Although she is a defender, Miss Houghton has scored in all three matches for Great Britain, helping the team to win their group. And today she will try to maintain her goal-a-game record when the team take on Canada in the quarter-finals at Coventry before a sell-out crowd. Miss Houghton became an instant celebrity after scoring the winner against Brazil at Wembley on Tuesday watched by a crowd of 70,000 – the biggest ever for a women’s football match in England. Such an audience would have been unthinkable a month ago, when many mocked the decision to kick-start the Olympics with women’s football and predicted half-empty stadiums. But Miss Houghton has helped to give the sport a prominence never seen before. Her followers on Twitter have soared from a couple of thousand to 20,556 in just a week and she has been declared the new poster girl for women’s football. The former shop assistant from County Durham is, however, not about to let her success go to her head. ‘I don’t actually know what’s happening at the moment,’ she said. ‘I am as surprised as anybody else, to be honest. The last week or so has just been amazing, absolutely unreal. ‘If somebody had told me before the tournament that I would score three times I would have told them they were having a laugh. It is just what every footballer dreams of.’ Miss Houghton grew up in the former mining village of South Hetton, close to where the dance film Billy Elliot was shot, with posters of Michael Owen and David Beckham on her wall. This week she met Beckham in person. Her mother Amanda, 47, a civil servant, told the Mail: ‘She sent me a text saying, “He’s perfect, Mum, he’s absolutely perfect”. ‘I told her that no man is perfect and she just said, “He is, Mum. He’s perfect”.’ Although she made Team GB – unlike Beckham – Miss Houghton can only dream of a lifestyle like his. Her £16,000 salary comes from England while she receives only expenses from her current club, Arsenal. Where it all began: Houghton's year began in fantastic fashion at the Olympics at Wembley . Celebration time: Steph takes in the Wembley atmosphere after she helped Team GB beat Brazil . Her shared home is close to the club’s training ground in London Colney, Hertfordshire. But if she is disappointed by her lifestyle, she doesn’t show it. She told the Mail: ‘It’s not comparable to the men’s game and it shouldn’t be: this is a completely different game.’ As a teenager, she watched Bend It Like Beckham ‘over and over again’, but her story also has more than a passing resemblance to 1981 film Gregory’s Girl, in which a teenage girl plays for a boys’ football team. Growing up: Aged eight, with four-year-old brother Stuart, and right, a star of the future at six months . She was given her first football at the age of three and, when she started primary school, became the only girl on the team. Her father Len, 47, an electrician, recalled how a boy’s parents were furious when their son was left out of the team in favour of her. He said: ‘They said she was the token girl and she shouldn’t have been picked at all. They said, “What’s she playing for, this is a boys’ game?” ‘Steph went on to score two goals in that match and someone said, “That’s why she was playing”.’ Number one fans: With grandmother Doreen and brother Stuart last year . At the age of nine, during a summer coaching camp run by Sunderland FC, she was spotted by a talent scout and joined the academy. She made her debut for the women’s team at 14 and moved on to Leeds United before signing for Arsenal in 2010. Her mother joked: ‘We tried to convert her into a girl but we couldn’t. She never had a doll or a pram. It was always just a football.’ Mr Houghton said: ‘The world is now her oyster. But she’s very level-headed and her feet are well and truly on the ground. ‘The Olympics will be over in a week for her and she’ll just head back to Arsenal and carry on as normal.’ Miss Houghton, who is single, said she had been inundated with messages from well-wishers. ‘The support I’ve had from family and friends has been unreal. My family always travel down and watch me play – and bring my grandma.’",Stephanie Houghton has scored in each of GB's three Olympic women's football matches .
"Christmas shoppers have been flocking to their computers today for Mega Monday bargains as early figures show some stores have seen a 50 per cent increase in trade. John Lewis said that as of 11am today it was receiving two orders a second online and its total sales was up 55 per cent on the same day last year. Among the most popular items were tablets, micro scooters and cashmere as shoppers searched for the best deals in time for Christmas. Marks and Spencer broke its record at lunchtime today for the number of orders received per minute. Many stores have slashed prices on presents by half and shoppers are expected to spend an astonishing £10,000 a second online. Web stores are anticipating 115million visits today – up by more than a third on last year – and for shoppers to spend as much as £465million. The figures will make today the busiest web shopping day of all time. Feeling the love: John Lewis' Christmas campaign was recently voted the best of the year and saw a 55 per cent increase in sales this morning compared to the same day last year . Hot presents: Amazon's Kindle Fire HD is expected to be a big seller tomorrow, as is the Furby toy . Marks and Spencer said it received three times as much traffic to its website today than yesterday. The most popular items were a reduced price Shawl Collar Cosy dressing gown, Festive Cheer Christmas hamper and a Per Una faux fur coat that was reduced from £99 to £79.20. Dom McBrien, Multi-channel Trading Director at M&S, said  'During the lunch hour window we saw a record number of orders per minute and a threefold increase in traffic compared to yesterday. Customers have been stocking up on Christmas gifts, with hampers and dressing gowns amongst the best selling items.” Asda Direct also announced this afternoon that its website has seen 20 per cent more traffic today than last year's Mega Monday. It is the fifth week running the supermarket chain has recorded its highest ever visitor numbers to the site. A spokesperson said an Acer laptop, HTC Salsa mobile phone and 40 inch Polaroid television have been the most popular items and they expect to sell 20 per cent more units today than last week. The managing director of Amazon said today could be the busiest day in the website's history. However, official figures have not yet been released. Christopher North said: 'As people increasingly shop on mobile devices and benefit from fast broadband at home, we're seeing a move towards customers buying their Christmas gifts later in the evening when they are at home relaxing.' Royal Mail said it is prepared for a significant rise in parcel deliveries and said its research shows more people will buy festive gifts online than ever before. Nick Landon said: 'Online shopping is now such a key part of the Christmas shopping experience. 'Royal Mail is prepared for this rise in parcels, by opening our eight dedicated parcel sort centres, which will assist our network during our busiest time of the year.' Experts expect gift hunters to hit the internet in their millions between 9am and 9pm as the Christmas rush bursts into life. They believe the total value of online shopping in December will top £5billion. Hourly spending is expected to exceed . last year’s, with purchases hitting their busiest patch during the lunch . hour and at 9pm when the day’s chores are done. Credit card firm Visa said it expected . its customers would make 6.8million transactions today, up 21 per cent . on the equivalent day last year. Tablet computers, such as the iPad Mini and Kindle Fire HD, are among the most searched-for items by web shoppers. Classic presents such as Barbie and . Scalextric remain strong, while Lego is the most searched for toy so far . of 2012, especially Lego Star Wars. Analysts at consumer information giant . Experian suggest the number of visits to virtual stores will be up by . 36 per cent on last year. Experts also expect the figures to include a . ten-fold increase in mobile shopping – on iPhones and other devices – . today. At the same time, internet gift purchases are predicted to rise some 15 . per cent to a new high, despite the pressure of the cost of living . squeeze. As a result, Royal Mail and other courier companies will be delivering . around four million purchases a day between now and Christmas Eve. The rise of the web will be at the expense of the high street as . traditional bricks and mortar outlets continue to struggle to attract . customers. All the major online specialists, such as Amazon, eBay, . Play.com and Pixmania, will be running sale events to tempt shoppers. Amazon sold more than 3million items and took 35 orders per second on the same Monday last year. However, it will also be a big day for names such as John Lewis, Marks & Spencer and all the big supermarkets, which are seeing online sales as their fastest growing sectors. M&S has recruited an additional 800 employees at its distribution centres and doubled the number of employees working in its e-commerce call centre. David Walmsley, multi-channel development director at M&S, said: ‘For months, we’ve been planning behind the scenes to make sure we’re fully prepared to manage the huge uplift in orders we’re expecting. ‘Christmas can be a hectic time for our customers so we’ve brought in extra support in our warehouses, customer services and in stores.’ Some firms have, however, already seen a . startling rise in sales. John Lewis this weekend reported a record week . for its online sales, soaring to £37.9million. James Murray, digital insight manager at Experian, said Christmas 2012 . was on track to be another ‘record-breaker for online retail, . out-stripping 2011 on all fronts’. He added: ‘The current market trends suggest that in the UK, Monday . December 3 will be the biggest pre-Christmas day for online retail, with . an estimated 115million visits to online retail outlets and a massive . 15million hours spent online shopping on this day alone.’ Experian also expects the next two Mondays to post significantly higher sales than the equivalent dates last year. British consumers will spend 375million hours shopping online in . December, 32million more hours than last year, Experian says.Last year . was a record-breaking year in terms of online retail. Shoppers made . 2.18billion visits to retail websites and spent 343million hours . shopping online. And on the same Monday last year . 84.6million visits were made to online sites, with Amazon and eBay . responsible for 28 per cent of all retail visits. Britain’s leading parcel and carrier manager Global Freight Solutions . estimates that December will see four million items being delivered to . homes and businesses every day. And ahead of the spending splurge the Royal Mail has opened eight . dedicated sorting centres to deal with the ‘significant’ increase in . volume of parcels. The official customer body, Consumer Focus, has warned shoppers who want . to make sure items arrive on time to order early to avoid any . disruption that may come with bad weather.

"Victims of graffiti commonly find themselves painting over misspelled profanities or scrubbing out obscene drawings. But when the residents of Northumberland Gardens woke to find their luxury cars had been vandalised, the tone was rather more – polite. Words including ‘very silly’, ‘really wrong’ and ‘arbitrary’ had been scratched into the paintwork with a screwdriver. Academic arrested: Professor Stephen Graham was arrested over the . late-night wrecking spree . Not that the choice of vocabulary will be much consolation. The late-night wrecking spree caused £20,000 damage to the 24 cars targeted in the affluent suburb of Jesmond, Newcastle. Hours later, Professor Stephen Graham, 47, was arrested and questioned by police. An academic at Newcastle University, he lives in the next street from Northumberland Gardens, where most of the attacks were carried out. Among the cars damaged were a Mercedes SLK, BMW 520, a BMW X5 and a Land Rover. A resident rang police in the early . hours of Bank Holiday Monday, when he spotted a man in black shorts and a . black jacket crouching down next to a car. Polite graffiti: Christine Carr was one of the residents of an affluent street whose car was vandalised with the words 'really wrong' scratched into her Mercedes . Professor Graham was later arrested by officers and held on suspicion of causing criminal damage. One resident of Northumberland Gardens, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘My neighbour came to me this morning and said her car had been damaged. ‘She guessed that the person responsible was more educated than your usual vandal because words were etched on rather than just scratches. ‘We wondered if it had anything to do with planning rows. There is an issue over restricted parking on nearby streets, so people have been bringing cars over to park around here.’ Mary Barrett, a retired psychologist, of . nearby Ripon Gardens, found her silver Mercedes E270 had been . vandalised with the word ‘arbitrary’ scratched into the paintwork in . six-inch high capital letters. ‘I felt sick when I saw it, I was close . to tears,’ she said yesterday. Mindless vandalism: A screwdriver was used to etch words into the . bodywork .

It is absolutely terrible. I’ve had the car for ten years and just had it re-sprayed a couple of weeks ago, which cost me £2,000. This is now going to cost me well over another £1,000 to fix.’ A black Nissan Navara 4x4 also had the word ‘wrong’ scratched into a panel. Professor Graham, a graduate of .

"When Darrell Plews discovered his wife of four years was leaving him after a whirlwind holiday romance with an African gardener he was, quite naturally, devastated. But his heartbreak turned to anger when he was told that 35-year-old Michelle had tied the knot in secret in Gambia. Plews, 44, gathered up his wife’s collection of designer clothes and shoes, dumped them on the patio of their £200,000 detached home, and started a bonfire. Happier times: Darrell and Michelle Plews on their wedding day, but Michelle later left her husband and married a man she met in Gambia while on holiday, sending him into a furious rage . Fifty handbags and more than 100 pairs of shoes – from the likes of Gucci, Jimmy Choo and Vivienne Westwood – went on the blazing pile. For six hours the company director fed item after item into the flames in the back garden and watched as they went up in smoke. His revenge earned him a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and a £5,000 bill to cover the damage to his ex-wife’s possessions. But despite the threat of jail, the father-of-two remained unrepentant yesterday. He said he had no idea his wife and  25-year-old gardener Lamin Dampha had fallen in love during a family holiday to Africa in December. The couple, who married in 2008, and their two children had travelled to Gambia on New Year’s Eve last year. While staying in Banjul they met £20-a-week gardener Mr Dampha. Victim: Michelle Plews, pictured, will receive £5,000 in compensation from her ex-husband for the property she lost in the patio blaze . ‘I never even expected anything was going on between them,’ added Plews. ‘I don’t really know when it started to be honest. ‘We got back on January 7 and about two weeks later I suggested she went back for another holiday, so she took our kids. When she came back, something wasn’t right. ‘I tried to confront her about it but we ended up having a huge row and I left.’ Weeks later, in March, Plews discovered his wife had returned to Gambia once more, so he drove round to the family’s £200,000 detached home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. While he was there his wife’s mother arrived. He claims she showed him the photographs and said they were of the wedding day. Mr Plews said: ‘She told me that Michelle had married this guy out there in January. I was absolutely shell-shocked. I couldn’t believe it at first but then her mum gave me the wedding photos, showing Michelle in her wedding dress and with all of his family. I couldn’t believe she had actually married this guy. They’d known each other about a week. He’s only 25. What could they possibly have in common?’ Mr Plews was so angry he found the wedding dress she had worn to marry Mr Dampha and, along with all of her designer shoes, handbags and clothes, set fire to them. ‘She loved her designer gear, so I knew it would annoy her. I bought most of the stuff anyway so I thought, right, I paid for this, I’m going to burn it,’ he added. ‘There was stuff by Gucci, Jimmy Choo, Vivienne Westwood, about 50 handbags, 100 pairs of shoes – anything I could get my hands on. ‘I made a pile of them on the flagstones in the back of the garden, poured petrol all over it and burnt the lot. Bonfire: Once Darrell heard his wife had married another man he stormed to their marital home in Wakefield, pictured, and torched designer clothes, shoes and handbags . ‘One of the neighbours sent her an email in Gambia to tell her what was happening so the next thing I knew, the police were knocking on the door. ‘I told them I was just burning some of my old clothes.’ Plews, who ran a store fitting company with his wife until they split up, was later charged with arson and theft and admitted the offences at Leeds Crown Court. Richard Canning, mitigating, said: ‘Mr Plews kept his wife, he thought, very happy over the years. It’s difficult for him not to see himself as the victim in this case. He has lost his wife, his house and his children.’ Plews, who has previous convictions for offences including grievous bodily harm, theft and burglary, must carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. He said he divorced two weeks ago. Since then, his ex-wife has returned to Gambia to officially register her marriage and plans to bring her new husband back to the UK. Mrs Plews said yesterday: ‘How am I meant to get married in one country when I’m already married in another? That’s bigamy. You tell me how that’s possible.’ She refused to comment further.","Vengeful Darrell Plews flew into a rage after his now ex-wife Michelle married another man in Africa while they were still hitched .

"A transgendered man permitted to use the women's locker rooms at a Washington college has created uproar among parents who say their children have been repeatedly exposed by him. At the center of the controversy, Colleen Francis, a 45-year-old student at Olympia's Evergreen College who identifies as a woman but with male genitalia, says she has a right to use the facilities and the school agrees. 'The college cannot discriminate based on the basis of gender identity,' Evergreen Spokesman Jason Wettstein told KOMO. 'Gender identity is one of the protected things in discrimination law in this state.' Exposed: Colleen Francis, who identifies herself as a woman but with male genitalia, has outraged some parents who say their children have seen her expose herself in a school's locker room . Taking their own action, however, parents of children who use the facility - sharing the pool's locker room with a high school swim club and children’s swim academy – have turned to the police. '[A mother] reported her daughter was upset because she observed a person at the women's locker room naked and displaying male genitalia,' a police report filed by a 17-year-old's mother in September read. A second report filed by an outside swim coach stated having ‘observed Colleen sitting with her legs open with her male genitalia showing’ in the sauna before telling her she had to leave and calling police. 'Little girls should not be exposed to naked men, period,' David Hacker, senior legal counsel with the Alliance Defending Freedom told Fox News. All eyes: The pools and locker rooms at Olympia's Evergreen College in Washington are used by a high school swim club and children¿s swim academy stirring complaints of Ms Francis' use around children . Contacted by upset parents, the alliance has warned the college to readdress their permission. The college retorts that they're only following state law and have since put up privacy curtains for the women who may feel uncomfortable. 'This is not 1959 Alabama. We don't call . the police for drinking from the wrong water fountain,' Ms Francis, the . student at the heart of the issue, spoke out to KIRO. That swim coach who called police that day says she did apologize to Ms Francis for questioning her, ‘bus she also explained there were girls 6 to 18 years of age and they were not use to seeing individuals in situations like this.’ The school has since set up a smaller, isolated section of the locker room for girls to change in, until the matter is resolved. Unpacified, Mr Hecker has warned the school that should any harm come to the girls affected by this, they will be held accountable. 'Clearly, allowing a person who is biologically a man to undress and . expose himself to young girls places those girls at risk for emotional . distress and harm,' he wrote to the college. 'Any reasonable . person would view this as dangerous to the young girls involved. The . fact that this individual was sitting in plain view of young girls . changing into their swimsuits puts you and Evergreen on notice of . possible future harm.'","Colleen Francis, a transgendered student at Evergreen College, has exposed herself in the locker room to the upset of parents and girls' swim coaches .

"The future of Radamel Falcao is set to be decided by Manchester United in April, with the striker reaffirming his desire to stay in England. Last summer's loan signing from Monaco has found life tough in England -  scoring just three Premier League goals in 12 appearances - but he has bedded himself into Louis van Gaal's side in recent weeks. That has served as encouragement for a club shelling out £265,000 a week on the Colombian and means they are now more receptive to a permanent deal than before. Radamel Falcao wants to remain at Manchester United beyond his loan spell at the end of the season . The Colombian has started to add consistency to his game for the Red Devils after a tricky start . Manager Louis van Gaal must decide whether the club should splash out on Falcao in the summer . It would still cost United around £43million to sign Falcao from the Ligue 1 side at the end of the season. That's something which the 28-year-old is desperate to happen. 'I'm good,' Falcao told ManUtd.com. 'My family are comfortable. We're enjoying life in Manchester and here at the club. The people have been great with me, with my family. We're happy and very grateful. 'Right from the start, they [my colleagues] welcomed me. They supported me and helped me with whatever I needed. They are a really humble group of players, really decent and, well, I was taken aback by how kind they've been.' Falcao celebrates scoring for United against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium on New Year's Day . The striker is now improving up front alongside Robin van Persie (right) and Wayne Rooney . Falcao hasn't been prolific but has scored two important goals in the recent draws against Aston Villa and Stoke City, with United supporters treated to an archetypal South American celebration. 'I place a lot of value in the hard work that I have to put in for each goal and I know just how much effort it requires, so that's why I celebrate like that,' he explained. 'For me, each goal means a lot so I put a lot of passion into my celebrations.' And that could also be down to the difficulty in finding the net in the Premier League. Falcao has never played in a league quite so quick, but relishes the challenge. 'It's more attractive than the French league,' he added. 'Defenders are stronger and more aggressive. In a good way, you know? It's intense and, well, overall just more physical. 'First of all, I'd say thank you so much for the way the fans have treated me. Then I'd want to wish them a happy 2015 and I hope that we can bring them some happiness.'","Manchester United have a deal in place to sign Radamel Falcao .

"These beautiful long-exposure photographs offer a novel twist on the too-often shamelessly narcissistic trend for 'selfie' pictures which is sweeping the internet. Paul Zizka, 34, has put his own slant on the celebrity-led photographic genre, made popular by photo-sharing website Instagram, by including his silhouette in these dramatic shots of the Canadian wilderness. Rather that a vainglorious attempt to propel himself to 15 minutes of internet fame, his inclusion of himself in the shots is an attempt to show the relationship between a mere man and the awesome natural world surrounding him.

Midnight At Moraine Lake: A long-exposure captures in detail the Rocky Mountains as they rise above and . are reflected in the titular lake in Banff National Park . Mr Zizka, from Alberta, one of Canada's three so-called Prairie provinces, began experimenting with night photography just two years ago. Captivated by the spectacular scenes of his home region, he nevertheless decided that to create photographs which were more unique he add the context of the human form into the shot. Using long exposures, allowing the night's sky illuminating the mountains around him, he has sought to create a relationship between the central figure in the image and the nature around him. Mr Zizka's photographs showcase breathtaking sights from the the Banff National Park and Kootenay National Park, both in the Canadian Rockies. Usually venturing out into the wilderness alone, his project is on-going as he gets new ideas every day for how to record himself in remarkable locations.

'Eventually, I ended up shooting more at night than during the day and I still take great pleasure in trying to document the magic that the stars, the moon and the aurora bring to a scene. 'I find that a photograph can sometimes convey so much more, or at least a very different feel if a person is included in the scene. 'I like the relationship between man and mountain that it instantly creates.

"A lottery winner who scooped £5.5million with a winning ticket illegally claimed thousands of pounds in benefits while living the high life in Spain, a court was told yesterday. Lawrence Candlish was catapulted into a list of the top 100 richest young people in the UK when he won the cash in 1997 at the age of 23. He splashed out on seven homes neighbouring his own for his family, and even shared out £1.2million among a dozen other relatives. Then and now: Lawrence Candlish, 38, scooped the multi-million-pound jackpot in 1997, left, but after moving to Spain in 2005 he claimed more than £13,000 in benefits. He appeared at court on crutches, above right . Candlish later emigrated to Spain, where he bought a Newcastle United-themed villa and a restaurant. But while he frittered away his . fortune 800 miles away on the Costa Blanca he was also claiming . thousands in disability living allowance. Accused: It was heard that Candlish's sister Melanie Batey, to whom he gave £800,000 of his winnings in 1997, claimed £23,131.09 in benefits she was not entitled to after she moved to Spain to live hear her brother . Candlish, who was not entitled to . claim any UK benefits while living abroad, yesterday escaped prison . after the court was told he returned to Britain last year penniless. Instead the 38-year-old was handed a . nine-month suspended sentence after he admitted pocketing £13,365. His . sister, Melanie Batey, a 39-year-old office clerk who moved to Spain to . be with him, also avoided jail after she claimed more than £20,000 in . benefits she was not entitled to. Factory worker Candlish, who suffers . from bone disease, was struggling on a £125-a-week wage when he scooped . the National Lottery jackpot, the court was told. He immediately split his fortune with . his parents and sister and splashed out £370,000 on seven homes on the estate where he lived in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, so his family could all . live near one another. But after thugs torched his house he . moved to Santa Pola, in Alicante. Once there, the Newcastle United fan . bought a villa and re-named it Casa Shearer in honour of former England . striker Alan Shearer. He also purchased an Irish-themed bar and . restaurant. But between May 2005 and December 2010 he continued claiming benefit payments from the Department for Work and Pensions. After the windfall: Candlish shared his newfound riches with his family in 2007. (left to right) Aunts Rachel and Gloria, sister Melanie, uncle Ken, mother Jenny and aunts Maureen and Linda. Batey, who is a paraplegic, and her . husband joined her brother in Spain in 2007 and continued to claim . income support she was not entitled to, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Vince Ward, mitigating for both, said . that since his lottery win Candlish had fallen on hard times. His . restaurant business had gone bankrupt and his father, Frank, 57, had . been found hanged in 2009. In 2010, Candlish flew home from Spain without a penny to his name.

He famously played a choking victim of Star Wars villain Darth Vader in 1977 film A New Hope. TMZ reports that the circumstances surrounding LeParmentier's death are currently unclear. The actor had appeared in more than 50 movies and TV shows but was best remembered for his role as the arrogant Admiral Motti, commander of Vader's planet destroying Death Star in 1977 film Star Wars: A New Hope. In the infamous scene, Motti mocks Vader's 'sorcerer's ways' and 'sad devotion to that ancient Jedi religion.' This leads to a near-fatal confrontation with the helmeted Vader who crushes his windpipe using 'the force.' LeParmentier also played a police officer in 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and is reported to have recently been working as a screenwriter for British television. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1946 to British and Irish parents, he moved to the UK in 1974.

"Manchester United are missing the defensive leadership of Nemanja Vidic, according to Michael Essien. The Ghanaian midfielder faces Vidic in the Milan derby on Sunday, in an echo of their tussles in the Premier League. Essien moved from Chelsea to Italy in January, while Serbian defender Vidic left Old Trafford for Inter at the end of the 2014 season. Michael Essien (right) is looking forward to renewing his rivalry with Nemanja Vidic in the Milan derby . The Serbia international (right) left Manchester United for Inter Milan in the summer . AC Milan v Inter Milan is live on BT Sport 1 at 7.45pm on Sunday. In the Serbian’s absence, seventh-placed United look brittle and have been forced to use youth players Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair, as well as Daley Blind, Michael Carrick and Marcos Rojo at centre-back at various stages. And Essien said: ‘I think he (Vidic) is being missed by United because things are not really going well for them, especially when it comes to their defence. ‘He is a top guy and really good defender. He gives everything and puts his body down for every tackle. It will be good to face him in another league. I will be looking forward to it and hopefully we will win.’ Essien, 31, believes Louis Van Gaal will eventually ‘sort it out’ but does not think any team is capable of catching Chelsea, who are winning at a similar rate to his debut season at Stamford Bridge in 2005-06. When he moved to west London from Lyon in a £24m deal, Chelsea won 10 and drew one of their first 11 games and went on to clinch the title by eight points. Essien believes Jose Mourinho's current crop are just as good. Essien insists that Manchester United are missing Vidic's leadership qualities at the back . Chelsea won the Premier League in Essien's first season, and look set to reclaim the title this term . ‘I do keep watching the Premier League. Chelsea are playing really well and are at the top, it will be difficult to overtake them,’ he said. ‘When I went there, we were very strong, and we won a lot of games and the title. I can see this team is as strong as when I first went to Chelsea. They are playing very good football and have very good quality players there. ‘I still keep in contact with Jose. We talk a bit about football and I will tell him that I am watching and they are doing well.’ Essien came into the Premier League the year Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane left, having studied two of the game’s dominant midfielders on television while in France.

"The spurned first lady lover of Francois Hollande will this week publish an explosive book in which the French president is ‘not spared’, it emerged today. Thank You For The Moment, which comes out on Thursday, is said to be a no-holds-barred account of Valerie Trierweiler’s 18 months at the Elysee Palace. It will be the first time that a serving French head of state has been exposed to a ‘kiss and tell’ book while still in office. Thank You For The Moment, which comes out on Thursday, is said to be a no-holds-barred account of Valerie Trierweiler’s 18 months at the Elysee Palace. She's pictured here with Francois Hollande in May 2013 . Ms Trierweiler’s time as first lady ended ignominiously in January when the 49-year-old was effectively sacked from her high profile role. It followed revelations about Mr Hollande’s secret love affair with the 42-year-old TV actress, Julie Gayet. He was regularly going to see the divorced mother-of-two on the back of a moped accompanied by security guards while officially being with Ms Trierweiler. The humiliation was so great for Ms Trierweiler, who herself has three children from an earlier marriage, that she checked herself into a public hospital for eight days suffering from ‘stress’. Mr Hollande had a secret love affair with Julie Gayet, pictured here attending the Opening Ceremony and Birdman premiere during the 71st Venice Film Festival on August 27 . She said that being cheated on and then dumped by Mr Hollande felt like ‘falling from a skyscraper’ and ‘like being hit by a high speed trains’. Such dramatic metaphors are expected to fill Thank You for the Moment, which will pour further ridicule on Mr Hollande. Breaking news of the upcoming book, French parliamentary commentator Brigitte Boucher said Mr Hollande ‘would not be spared’, not to mention the entire Elysee Palace soap opera. Mr Trierweiler, who forged her career as a journalist on Paris Match, has already blamed 'low blows', 'betrayals' and 'back-stabbing' for the way she was treated. She originally said she wanted to be a Princess Diana style ‘Queen of Hearts’ who travels the world helping the poor and the sick. However, she was widely mocked in France for travelling around Mumbai in a chauffeur driven limousine while staying in the five star Taj Palace Hotel during a humanitarian trip to India earlier this year. Ms Trierweiler is often referred to as 'Rotteweiler' because of the way she savages her enemies and critics are already referring to the book as the 'Rottweiler's Revenge'. Mr Hollande, who had never married, remains a ‘bachelor president’, although he has four grown-up children with his Ecology Minister, Segolene Royal. Ms Gayet has not spoken since pictures were published of Mr Hollande leaving their Paris love nest on the back of a moped, while using a crash helmet as a poor disguise. Ms Trierweiler is yet to comment on Thank You For This Moment (Merci Pour Ce Moment) which is being prepared under conditions of great secrecy. It is published by editions Les Arènes. Carla Bruni has made a heartfelt plea to her husband Nicolas Sarkozy to stay out of politics because it makes her 'mad with anger'. The former French president, who turns 60 in January, is under investigation for a range of corruption charges which could see him go to prison. Yet supporters believe that the country's Socialist head of state, Francois Hollande, is failing so spectacularly that even 'Sarko' can beat him. This has worried Ms Bruni, 46, with a friend telling Le Parisien newspaper that she provoked a domestic crisis during the couple's summer holiday in Bali. 'Carla threw a fit at him,' said the source. 'She doesn't want him to return. She can't stand the nastiness, the hatred.' Referring to Mr Sarkozy's single period of office, which ended in failure in 2012 following defeat by Mr Hollande, the friend added: 'She was wounded and is still mad with anger.' The couple were widely attacked and ridiculed during the five years, especially for their high-living and alleged vulgarity. Mr Sarkozy was said to be obsessed with making as much money as possible, while even Carla's charity activities came under scrutiny. The supermodel turned pop singer is particularly angry over claims - which she denies - that she wasted public money and enriched friends with her personal fundraiser, the Carla Bruni Foundation. Carla, who was often likened to the former French queen Marie Antoinette during her time as first lady, is still convinced the media wants 'to skin her man alive'. However, many commentators believe that Carla's latest outburst - made during a time when she was suffering from tendinitis in the shoulder - is all part of a carefully coordinated media campaign. The couple posed for pictures on a scooter for the glossy magazine Paris Match last month, giving an impression of marital bliss. One Paris analyst said: 'The idea is that Sarkozy will sacrifice domestic happiness for the good of France - both he and Carla know all about getting their PR message across!' Allies insist Mr Sarkozy's likely comeback as leader of the UMP opposition in time for the 2017 presidential election was never in doubt. Former finance minister Michel Sapin said of Mr Sarkozy: 'I have no doubt that he has wanted to make a comeback from the first day.' The allegations against Mr Sarkozy include claims that he received millions in illegal cash from the late Libyan dictator, Colonel Gaddafi. He denies all the charges.","Valerie Trierweiler's Thank You For The Moment comes out on Thursday .

"Nemanja Vidic's agent has rubbished reports that the former Manchester United defender is set for a return to Old Trafford. Vidic joined Inter Milan this summer after agreeing a deal earlier in the year when David Moyes was in charge of the club. Rumours of a return were fuelled when the Serbian's wife, Ana, and one of their four children watched United's draw with Chelsea in October.

"An armed officer with a Taser (circled) on duty when Dale Cregan, accused of murdering two policewomen, appeared in court . Three people are shot every day by police armed with 50,000-volt Taser stun guns, figures revealed last night. The potentially deadly devices were deployed in almost 4,500 confrontations last year, more than ever before. Spending on the weapons and their accessories doubled to £1.2million and police chiefs are considering whether to extend the availability of the devices even further. One chief constable said the murder of two women officers in Manchester last week throws the use of Tasers into a ‘new light’. Patrick Geenty, who leads the Wiltshire force, said the weapons are an ‘obvious’ alternative to arming more officers with conventional firearms. He said: ‘Officers feel the Taser gives them an extra bit of protection from some of the circumstances they find themselves in.’ Police are investigating whether one of the two Manchester officers may have tried to use a Taser to defend herself last week. A bright yellow Taser was found out of its holster and close to where PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes lay. Debate continues over the merits of the controversial American-made weapons. The potentially deadly devices were deployed in almost 4,500 confrontations last year, more than ever before . There are around 12,000 Tasers on the streets of Britain, mostly used by trained officers. The Police Federation, which . represents the junior ranks, wants the Government to spend millions to . increase the number to 36,000, enough for all officers on duty. But . critics claim the latest figures reveal a dangerous ‘arms race’ is . taking place and warned that increased availability could reduce control . of their use. Serious questions have been raised after the weapons were used in incidents involving the mentally ill, elderly and vulnerable. The . latest figures were revealed in a series of requests to every force . across England and Wales under the Freedom of Information Act. One of the weapons was found out of its holster close to the bodies of  Fiona Bone(left), and Nicola Hughes the two police officers murdered in Manchester . They show that Tasers were deployed . at least 4,461 times last year compared with 3,219 times in 2010, an . increase of almost 40 per cent. The . weapons were fired into suspects at least 1,081 times, an average of . almost three occasions every day, compared with 744 times in 2010. There . were huge variations in how often the weapons were used. Top of the . list was Greater Manchester Police, where they were fired 195 times, and . the Met, with 101 times. In smaller and rural forces, including Cheshire, Dyfed-Powys and Sussex, the number of discharges remained in single figures. Meanwhile . separate figures showed that forces doubled their spending on the . weapons, ammunition and related equipment to more than £1.2million a . year. The sum rose from £571,894 in 2009/10 to £1,255,483 in 2011/12. The . true figure is likely to be far higher because the Met, which accounts . for around a third of police spending, could not supply any details. West . Mercia Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, who has national . responsibility for Taser use, said the devices have avoided the need for . conventional guns in some situations. Concerns: Critics claim the latest figures reveal a dangerous 'arms race' is taking place and warned that increased availability could reduce control of their use . He said: ‘In more than half of cases, the mere threat of its use has been enough to deter violent individuals and ensure a peaceful resolution of the incident. ‘Every chief constable makes a decision, based on an assessment of the risks in their own area, to train and deploy a proportionate number of officers to use Taser so that the public are kept safe and their officers are protected as far as possible.’ But Amnesty International said Tasers should be used only where there is a threat to life or of serious injury and by a restricted number of highly-trained officers. A spokesman said: ‘Tasers can be a better option than guns but both in the UK and the US people have died after being shocked with them. ‘Amnesty International doesn’t want to see the UK hurtling even further down the slippery slope towards arming all officers with Tasers, or worse towards a situation like that in the US where they have been widely misused.’","The devices were deployed in almost 4,500 confrontations last year .

"France wants the UK to pay for a day centre for the illegal immigrants gathered at Calais, says a left-wing French MP. The suggestion came from Yann Capet who met Bernard Cazeneuve, the Interior Minister, today and suggested a centre should be established in Calais and others nearby. 'The minister was most insistent that there must be British solidarity very concretely and not only in words but also in actions. Sudanese refugees today in Calais.  A 'new Songatte' camp has been established in some woods just outside Calais by refugees who are waiting to get into the UK . Once again gangs of  migrants are forming at Calais, ready to make an assault on the UK . 'There is no question of the British washing their hands of this problem', said M Capet. 'The English could be incited to take part “financially as well” in the setting up of the Calais day centre and other buildings which would complement it. 'There is also the possibility that the British government will send representatives to Calais to explain the truth to the migrants.’ Last week M Cazeneuve said in an interview published in Calais that he wanted migrants to be told that it was no longer an El Dorado for refugees. He said he was in favour of day centres where migrants could receive help and advice and be told of their rights in France. Yann Capet is a political opponent of Natacha Bouchart, the right-wing mayor of Calais. He is also an opposition member of the Calais municipal council. On Monday he invited the mayor to take part in a joint meeting with the Interior Minister but Mme Bouchart declined. ‘In her turn Madame Bouchart was due to meet the Interior Minister late this afternoon to try to persuade him to give the go ahead for a Sangatte type overnight hostel for 400 migrants which she said her town needs as a matter of urgency,’ he said.

"A California Highway Patrol officer videotaped repeatedly punching a woman on the side of a Los Angeles freeway had just pulled her from oncoming traffic, and she resisted by pushing him, a patrol investigator revealed in his report earlier today. 51-year-old Marlene Pinnock had been walking barefoot on eastbound Interstate 10 west of downtown Los Angeles on July 1, when she was tackled to the ground by Officer Daniel Andrew, who then brutally beat her as one passerby filmed the event. In his report, investigator Sean Taketa outlined the incident in a request to search Mrs. Pinnock's medical records and assess the extent of her injuries. Scroll down for video . Attack: Motorist David Diaz filmed a California Highway Patrol officer straddle a Marlene Pinnock while punching her in the head on the Interstate 10 in Los Angeles . Attack: The 51-year-old pushed the officer after he tried to pull her out of traffic, causing the attack according to an investigator . Attack: Several people have claimed they recognize the California Highway Patrol officer in the footage of the July 1 assault because they'd also had run-ins with him . Pinnock has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had been off her medication for two to three months before the altercation. Officer Andrew arrived and told Pinnock she could walk off or have a ride away from the freeway, according to the warrant. She walked away without listening to his instructions and moved partially into traffic, so Andrew 'grabbed her arm to prevent her from being struck by traffic. Ms. Pinnock resisted by pushing the officer,' the documents say. Andrew then straddled her on the ground as Pinnock resisted by 'kicking her legs, grabbing the officer's uniform and twisting her body,' the investigator wrote. Andrew 'struck her in the upper torso and head several times with a closed right fist,' the records say. Mrs. Pinnock has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder . The victim's family have hired Los Angeles attorney Caree Harper to represent them in the case against the California Highway Patrol. Harper said her clients want the authorities held accountable for 'beating a great-grandmother in broad daylight.' 'We want the focus to be what he was doing to her, not what she was doing' prior to the confrontation, said Harper. 'She was getting beat like an animal. No one should ever be beat like that.' The California Highway Patrol had vowed to carry out a thorough investigation. CHP Assistant Chief Chris O'Quinn had said at a news conference soon after the event that the woman was endangering herself and people in traffic, and the officer was forced to restrain her. O'Quinn added that the Mrs. Pinnock had begun walking off the freeway but returned when the confrontation occurred. Passing motorist David Diaz recorded the uniformed officer as he jabbed Mrs Pinnock at least 11 times in the head. 'The most animalistic, most brutal way to subdue someone is to pound someone's head into the concrete with really big blows to the head,' Diaz said at the time. 'There was no weapons - it's obviously excess force,' he continued. 'He starts really letting loose... He starts pounding down on her face really hard. He doesn't try to grab her hands first.' In an interview with the AP, Pinnock said she believed the officer was trying to kill her. ""He grabbed me, he threw me down, he started beating me,"" she said. ""I felt like he was trying to kill me, beat me to death."" Andrew, who is on paid administrative leave, joined the Highway Patrol as a cadet in April 2012 and became an officer six months later.","On July 1, 51-year-old Marlene Pinnock was beat on the side of the road by Officer Daniel Andrew in L.A., while a passing driver filmed the event .

"Lt. Garlin Murl Conner retired from the U.S. Army as the second-most decorated soldier during World War II, earning four Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, seven Purple Hearts and the Distinguished Service Cross after 28 straight months in combat. But despite backing from congressmen, senators, military veterans and historians, he never received the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military distinction, awarded for life-risking acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty. Now a federal judge in Kentucky has ended his widow's 17-year quest to see that her husband received the prestigious medal posthumously. Battle lost: A Kentucky judge ruled that Lt. Garlin Murl Conner will not receive a Medal of Honor because his widow waited too long to try and amend her husband's service record . U.S. District Judge Thomas Russell ruled Tuesday that a technicality will prevent Pauline Conner of Albany, Kentucky, from continuing her campaign on behalf of her husband, who died in November 1998 at age 79. Russell concluded that Pauline Conner waited too long to present new evidence to the U.S. Army Board of Correction of Military Records, which rejected her bid to alter her husband's service record. Russell praised Conner's 'extraordinary courage and patriotic service,' but said there was nothing he could do for the family. 'Dismissing this claim as required by technical limitations in no way diminishes Lt. Conner's exemplary service and sacrifice,' Russell wrote. Richard Chilton, a former Green Beret and amateur military historian who has researched Conner's service, said Conner deserves the Medal of Honor. Hero and heartthrob: Audie Murphy became the most decorated U.S. soldier in World War II and went on to star in dozens of Hollywood films . Chilton vowed to get resolutions from lawmakers and veterans' groups in all 50 states in an attempt to get Congress to act on Conner's behalf. 'I want to make sure they can't walk away from this,' Chilton told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 'He's a man worthy of this.' Roughly 3,400 people have received the Medal of Honor since it was created in 1861, including actor Audie Murphy, the most decorated U.S. soldier in World War II. Murphy fought in the same regions as Conner and went on to star in dozens of Hollywood films, most of them Westerns and war flicks. Conner served with the 3rd Infantry Division, which fought in France and Europe in 1945. The Army in 2001 named Eagle Base in Bosnia-Herzegovina after Conner. 'He was a real hero,' said attorney Donald Todd of Lexington, who represents Conner's family. Conner's citation for the Distinguished Service Cross states that on January 24, 1945, near Houssen, France, he slipped away from a military hospital with a hip wound to rejoin his unit rather than return home to Kentucky. The wounded solider then unreeled a telephone wire, plunged into a shallow ditch in front of the battle line and directed multiple rounds of fire for three hours as German troops continued their offensive, sometimes getting within five yards of Conner's position. The board first rejected Conner's application in 1997 on its merits and turned away an appeal in June 2000, saying at the time no new evidence warranted a hearing or a new decoration despite more than a dozen letters of support for Conner. In the years that followed, lawmakers in Kentucky, Tennessee and three other states passed resolutions backing the effort to see Conner receive the Medal of Honor. After Chilton found three eyewitness accounts to Conner's deeds in 2006, Pauline Conner resubmitted the case to the board in 2008 — two years after the statute of limitations expired. Impressive hardware: Conner was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross (left) for going above and beyond the call of duty while fighting in France, but his application for a Medal of Honor (right) was rejected twice . A bipartisan group of current and former members of Congress has backed Conner's application in the past, including retired Sen. Bob Dole, a Kansas Republican and World War II veteran; retired Sen. Wendell Ford, a Democrat from Kentucky; current Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky; and Whitfield, who represents Conner's home town near the Tennessee line. Noted World War II historian Steven Ambrose, who died in 2002, wrote in November 2000 to support Conner's application, saying his actions were 'far above the call of duty.' The review board remained unmoved by Conner's submission. 'The most recent information received 22 December 2008 is not new evidence and does not warrant granting an exception to the above cited regulation and a formal hearing,' wrote Conrad V. Meyer, the director of the Army Board for Correction of Military Records February 9, 2009. While the military board has upgraded other recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross to a Medal of Honor, the action is rare. A . s of 2012, the last year available, 178 Distinguished Service Crosses had been elevated to Medal of Honor status out of 13,000 issued since 1917. Military policy dictates that the first decoration must be re-examined, re-justified and then re-evaluated with new evidence before any action can be taken. The military can also conduct a review at the behest of Congress. In February, the Pentagon announced that President Barack Obama will bestow the Medal of Honor on 24 other veterans after a decade-long congressionally mandated review of minorities who may have been passed over for it because of prejudices. The unusual mass ceremony, scheduled for Tuesday, will honor veterans — most of Hispanic or Jewish heritage — who already had been recognized with the Distinguished Service Cross. Conner's commander in World War II, retired Maj. Gen. Lloyd B. Ramsey filed an affidavit saying Conner's work, while injured, provided valuable intelligence. Friends in high places: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is part of a bipartisan group of current and former members of Congress who have backed Conner's application . 'There is no doubt that Lt. Conner should have been awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions,' Ramsey wrote.

"Victoria Cross winner: Gobind Singh was awarded the accolade in 1918 after the Battle of Cambrai . The Battle of Cambrai in 1917 is known as one of the first great tank offensives - but the diaries tell of the incredible heroism of horse cavalry there too. They contain a graphic account of swords and lances being pitted against guns and of how an Indian soldier named Gobind Singh won the Victoria Cross for saving his fellow men by delivering urgent messages - despite having three horses shot under him as he did so and finishing each journey on foot. At the heart of the action on December 1, midway through the bloody battle, was the Mhow Cavalry, a brigade of the Indian Army, which ‘advanced under heavy machine gun fire from the flanks’ but ‘most gallantly continued towards its objective’ of capturing a German position. They had been ordered to ‘endeavour to push forward’ despite the non-arrival of 14 tanks which were supposed to be supporting them - and ‘galloped up to the trench and crossed it, pretending not to see the Germans, who let them go by. They then turned about and galloped back under heavy machine gun fire.’ The report tells how on that day, December 1, some horses passed through a gap in a barbed wire fence, while others jumped it, then ‘a few men led by Lieutenant Broadway chased some retreating Germans. ‘Lt Broadway had already killed two Germans with the sword when he was treacherously killed by a revolver shot by a German officer, who raised one had in token of surrender keeping the other behind his back. 'The German officer was immediately killed by a lance thrust from a man following Lt Broadway.’ Having succeeded in helping to capture the outpost, the cavalry came under renewed attack, were cut off and surrounded. But the report says ‘notwithstanding this and also heavy machine gun fire from both flanks, a sowar [mounted soldier] brought in two messages describing the situation to Brigade HQ. He had three horses shot under him but nevertheless was ready, and wished to return to his regiment’. That sowar, unnamed in the diary report, was Gobind Singh, then aged 29, from a small village named Damoi in Rajasthan. He crossed the 1.5-mile battlefield three times despite being under fire, and losing three horses . The Germans lost 50,000 men, and the British lost 45,000 during the bloody battle on December 1 . His citation for the VC, the highest military award for bravery, in the London Gazette of January 11, 1918, reads: ‘For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty in thrice volunteering to carry messages between the regiment and brigade headquarters, a distance of over 1 1/2 miles over open ground which was under the observation and heavy fire of the enemy. ‘He succeeded each time in delivering his message, although on each occasion his horse was shot dead and he was compelled to finish his journey on foot.’ Singh survived the war and died aged 60 in 1942. The Battle of Cambrai, which began in November 1917, was an attempt to break through the Hindenburg Line, a German defensive position on the Western Front. Casualties were high with the Germans suffering overall losses of approximately 50,000 and the British 45,000. The report in the diaries on the cavalry’s role on December 1 adds: ‘Too much cannot be said of the spirit and conduct of all ranks of the Central India Horse throughout the day.’","Gobind Singh, 29, delivered messages during Battle of Cambrai in 1917 .

"Alec Baldwin's stalker Genevieve Sabourin claimed today that she was forced to sleep on excrement-smeared floors during the first days of her sentence for harassing the actor. The French-Canadian alleged that she had suffered a 'heart attack' at Rikers Island in New York and was billed for medication because as a non-U.S. citizen, she doesn't qualify for Medicare. Last week, Sabourin, 41, was found guilty of aggravated harassment, stalking and attempted criminal contempt among 23 other counts. She was sentenced to 210 days in total behind bars. Genevieve Sabourin, pictured outside court last week, claimed today that she had been forced to sleep on excrement-covered floors as she began her sentence at Riker's Island for stalking Alec Baldwin . In a short interview from jail on Thursday, wearing her green prison jumpsuit, the bit-part actress told the New York Post: 'I have slept on the floor for three days. It was covered in excrement. I had a heart attack.' Since being taken off from court in handcuffs last week, Sabourin has been held at Central Booking, the Tombs and now Rikers. She did not make clear where the 'excrement' was on the floor. The City of New York Department of Correction was not immediately available for comment when called by MailOnline. Sabourin, who is due to appear in court on Friday, is scheduled to be released from prison March 30, 2014. She is serving six months for stalking and harassing Baldwin and his wife Hilaria.

Mr Kybett used horse meat to get the five-and-a-half-year-old male to spread out, and after a few goes was able to measure him at a length of about 6ft 6in (2m). Asked which animals were the hardest to measure and weigh, he said: 'It's down to individuals really. 'Melati, the female, is very difficult because she is quite a nervy animal, very tigress-y and will keep away from you. 'That particular individual is quite difficult to get on to the weighing scales - although we have achieved that we haven't been able to measure her length.

'The first time we put the scales in there, it was very scary for him apparently, so he ran to the other side of the paddock and wouldn't come anywhere near us,' Ms Ryan said. 'It's taken about a month but we've done it using positive reinforcement, just getting him closer and closer.

"A rare, endangered sea turtle was spotted off the Dorset coast after it got lost on its way to the Mediterranean. The 4ft loggerhead turtle was seen as it made its 3,000 mile journey across the Atlantic from the east coast of America. It is thought the unusually warm UK waters fooled the creature into thinking it had arrived in the Canary Islands. The turtle was spotted by a sailor off the Dorset coast. It is believed the turtle mistook the warm waters of Britain for the Canary Islands where it usually migrates to at this time of the year . The turtle was spotted by sailor, Jim Davies, off Portland Bill in Dorset. Mr Davies was fishing on his 23ft motorboat when he caught a glimpse of the animal which is listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. 'I was out on my boat on my own doing a spot of fishing when I saw a large creature just under the surface about 200ft away,' he said. 'At first I thought it might be a giant ocean sunfish but then it surfaced about 30ft away and I could see it was a huge turtle.' Mr Davies, who is a RAF squadron leader added: 'It looked up at the boat and we locked eyes. As soon as it saw me it dived back under the water and I didn't see it again. 'I . was quite surprised to see it - turtle sightings are rare enough in UK . waters but afterwards I found out it was a very rare loggerhead turtle. 'I have done a lot of diving abroad and seen turtles before but I have never seen one in the UK. Davina the Dolphin swam over 30 miles up the River Dee in North Wales, entertaining many holidaymakers on its way . 'It was a wonderful creature and I feel very privileged to have seen it close up.' Visits to British shores from loggerheads are incredibly rare, with the last reported sighting of a lin Dorset in 1938. In 2012 there were 45 sightings of the more common leatherback turtles in UK waters, but only four loggerheads were spotted which were all dead. Dr Peter Richardson, a biodiversity programme manager for the Marine Conservation Society, said: 'To see an adult loggerhead in British waters is quite unusual. 'We do get them coming to our waters occasionally but they are usually stray juveniles with a very low tolerance for our cold waters . 'This loggerhead will have almost certainly come from the east coast of the USA and will have been drawn here by our unusually warm waters. 'The recent warm weather not only heated up our seas but also resulted in very healthy jellyfish stocks which turtles feed on. 'Loggerheads will travel great distances from their feeding to their breeding grounds and the likelihood is once our waters start cooling down this turtle will head home.' Loggerheads are the most temperate species of marine turtle, with breeding grounds in the Mediterranean and the east coast of the USA. They only feed in waters above 15C and cannot survive in waters colder than 10C. The turtles, whose latin name is Caretta caretta, nest on beaches and get their name from their unusually large heads. They feed on crabs, mussels, clams and jellyfish, and can weigh up to 400lbs. Earlier this week a dolphin was spotted swimming up the River Dee in North Wales and in Chester. The . dolphin, nicknamed Davina, was rescued after becoming stranded on a . sandbank having entertained holidaymakers for four days. The . 6ft short-beaked common dolphin stunned crowds with a display of leaps . and clicking noises along the 9 mile stretch of water. She has since been safely returned to the sea, where she will no doubt rejoin the pod she strayed from last week. A . swordfish usually found in the tropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific . and Indian oceans has landed in the nets of a North Sea fisherman. The . fish was caught on Wednesday morning by Ian Wakenshaw on the Beverly . Ann, a catamaran fishing boat used to catch wild salmon and sea trout . off the Tyneside coast. It . has since made its way to a local fishmonger, Rob Latimer, who was . delighted to see the swordfish turn up in his daily delivery. Mr . Latimer said: 'It's spectacular, it is really nice to see such an . unusual fish on our shores and it shows off what we have in the North . Sea. 'This is the second swordfish I have come across in five years. We have also caught a few Tuna of late as well. 'I was expecting lobsters, crab and a few squid. The last thing I expected to be selling is a swordfish!' 'I have had a lot of interest from customers who have came in to see the fish on the counter. 'I think the customers will appreciate its freshness. I will be cutting it up today and having a bit for my tea!' Tyneside fishmonger, Rob Latimer, was thrilled to be handed a rare swordfish in his daily delivery on Wednesday morning. The fish is usually found in more tropical waters in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans .","The endangered loggerhead turtle was spotted by a sailor off Portland Bill, Dorset .

"A Conservative MP has criticised the body responsible for overseeing politicians' expenses claims, claiming they are trying to 'screw MPs into the ground'. Karl McCartney, the MP for Lincoln, says he has been forced to borrow £25,000 from his parents because of late payments by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) caused by delays in the processing of his expenses payments, a situation he claims that many other MPs face. Mr McCartney also claims an Ipsa insider told him the body is purposefully hostile to politicians in an interview with BBC Radio 4. He said: 'It was over £25,000 and that was by the August after we’d been elected in May. Karl McCartney (right), pictured with Conservative Leader David Cameron, says he has been owed money by Ipsa for five months . 'That sum of money is a huge sum of money and that was all the money that I'd had to spend out for whatever, for my staff, for staff salaries, and that was owed by Ipsa. 'Well my staff as well as myself have to live. We've got mortgages to pay, we've got families to look after and provide for. 'At the age of 42 I’m not proud of the fact I had to go to my mother and father and ask them if they could help me out because our credit cards, our loans at the bank were all maxed out and I wasn’t the only Member of Parliament that had to do that. Many Members of Parliament have had to do that, from all parties.' He added that a senior Ipsa official had told him that staff at the watchdog were listening to friends who say they should 'screw MPs into the ground'. 'He basically said that he and his fellow senior management team at Ipsa, when they go to the pub on a Friday night and meet with their friends, their friends tell them that they should screw MPs into the ground and [he said] that’s what he was going to do,' Mr McCartney said. The MP says he has been forced to borrow £25,000 from his parents because of the delay in reimbursing claims . In February the MP, who earns £65,738 a year, was forced to apologise to Ipsa for writing 'abusive and offensive' messages to its staff when making claims. He told one official they were 'talking s****', and blasted another as a 'pedantic SOAB', slang for 'son of a b****'. Mr McCartney said he regretted making the comments on claim forms but they were from sheer frustration because Ipsa was failing to pay MPs on time. 'Those comments came from the frustration of having to deal with an organisation that really is incompetent and certainly when we were first elected and there was a huge new number of MPs that were elected, but I found myself well into five figures – the money that I was owed by IPSA for over five months,' he said. A spokesman for said Mr McCartney was making 'wild claims' that were untrue. In January the Lincolnshire Echo reported that he doesn't think the current MP salary is enough after it emerged that MPs want a 32 per cent pay rise. Mr McCartney said: 'This salary is far from consummate with the role that many MPs from all political sides dutifully undertake, and indeed there are a large number of allowances that MPs are able to claim, but do not, due no doubt to various pressures, particularly from an unreasonable and unrealistic media and certain sectors of the public.'","MP Karl McCartney says he has been forced to borrow £25,000 from parents .

"Britain’s economy has grown more quickly  than previously thought since the Coalition took power, official figures revealed this morning. In the four years since 2010  the economy has grown by 8.1 per cent – 1.1 per cent more than the original estimate, according to the Office for National Statistics. It means the economy is now 2.7 per cent bigger than it was before the economic crash in 2007. Overall, Britain has enjoyed the third best economic growth in the G7 since 2010 – more than France and Germany, but still behind the US and Canada. Chancellor George Osborne this morning welcomed the revised economic figures showing Britain's economy was bigger than first thought . The ONS has changed the way it measures the size of the economy - showing that the recession was not as bad as first thought . This morning’s figures, released by the ONS after it changed the way it measures the size of the economy, also showed that the economic crash was not as bad as first thought. The Chancellor George Osborne said it was a ‘double dose of good economic news’. He Tweeted: ‘UK GDP growth in 2011 & 2012 revised up –UK has now grown 8.1% under this Government, up from 7.0% & faster than France & Germany.’ The Treasury now believe the UK economy passed its pre-crisis peak between July and September last year. It was previously thought that the economy only got back to where it was in 2007 earlier this year. The economy is now 2.7 per cent above the pre-recession peak – compared to the 0.2 per cent previously thought. Despite this positive news the recession in 2008 remains the deepest since records began in 1948. Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said the economic recovery is not being felt by ordinary families . The economic crash saw the economy shrink by 6 per cent – less than the 7.2 per cent previously thought. ONS chief economist Joe Grice said: ‘Despite the wide ranging improvements underpinning the new estimates, the broad picture of the economy has not changed much. ‘Although the downturn was less deep than previously estimated and subsequent growth stronger, it remains the case that the UK experienced the deepest recession since ONS records began in 1948 and the subsequent recovery has been unusually slow.’ It comes after the latest report from the World Economic Forum lifted the UK one place to ninth in its international competitive ratings. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘These ONS revisions show an economy that has been growing more strongly than previously thought, with almost every quarter under this government being revised upward.’ But Chris Leslie, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, commenting on Office for National Statistics changes to the National Accounts, said: These accounting changes to the way GDP is measured - for instance to include drug dealing and prostitution - do not mean families or businesses are better off. 'GDP growth has been revised up in every year since 2008. But it’s still the case that working people are substantially worse off under this government, that the recovery was choked off in 2010 and that it is the slowest on record. 'Working people want a plan to tackle the cost-of-living crisis they still face, not complacent claims from Ministers that everything is fixed or that accounting changes mean we’re somehow better off.'","In the four years since 2010 the economy has grown by 8.1%, the ONS said .

"Giant mosquitoes the size of a quarter are invading central Florida and officials are warning residents to beware of the 'notoriously aggressive' bloodsuckers. Entomologists at the University of Florida predicted the massive insects, known as gallinippers, would descend on the sunshine state in record numbers this year after drenching rains from Tropical Storm Debbie. Now the mammoth monsters have arrived, being spotted in Seminole County. The frightening supermosquitoes, native to the eastern half of the United States, are 20 times the size of an ordinary mosquito and their bite is unusually painful. Ouch: The giant gallinipper mosquito, pictured, is invading central Florida . Seminole County Mosquito Control director Kelly Deutsch told ClickOrlando.com said the county began pre-treatment spraying in local swamplands several months ago to prepare for the onslaught. Last year, Floridians in wet areas experiences a bumper crop of the bloodsuckers that thrive in heavily flooded areas. But this year they're back in even higher numbers. 'It's mean, and it goes after people, and it bites, and it hurts,' Anthony Pelaez of the Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa told WOFL in March. Huge: The creatures are 20 times the size of an ordinary mosquito . Indian River County mosquito control director Doug Carlson told WPTV the bugs are so big 'it can feel like a small bird has landed on you' when you get bitten. Gallinippers, officially known as psorophora ciliate, allegedly got their nickname because they're so big they can 'nip a gallon of blood with a single bite,' Carlson said. University of Florida entomologist Phil Kaufman told ClickOrlando.com that gallinippers are 'notoriously aggressive' and warned residents to wear insect repellant with DEET and cover up more than usual to protect themselves from painful stings. Rains: The drenching rains from last year's Tropical Storm Debbie are behind this year's influx . But, thankfully, he said the super-sized species isn't known to carry any harmful viruses. Deutsch told the website the recent drenching in the area from Tropical Storm Andrea would likely cause a spike in all mosquitoes species. Nearby Volusia County is also warning of an influx, and has begun spraying near storm drains.","Mosquito, known as Gallinippers, are 'notoriously aggressive' and have an unusually painful bite .

"A 64-year-old Fairbanks man was mauled to death by a bear at a remote lake in Alaska's interior, authorities said Friday. The man and a family member were at a cabin at George Lake, about 110 . miles southeast of Fairbanks, when the attack occurred Thursday . evening. The family member sought shelter inside the cabin and called authorities, Alaska State Troopers spokeswoman Megan Peters said. A troopers helicopter dispatched from Fairbanks was unable to land in . the terrain, but a Pavehawk helicopter from Eielson Air Force Base in . Fairbanks was able to drop personnel at the site. Alaska Wildlife . Troopers also responded by boat, aided by Good Samaritans. Grizzly: A 64-year-old Alaska man was allegedly mauled to death Thursday by a bear . Responders found the man's body outside the cabin, and the . traumatized family member inside. The victim was identified as Robert . Weaver, Peters said. ""Troopers did search the area when they first got there, but no bear was located,"" Peters said. That soon changed, however, as responders investigating the death encountered a black bear. ""The black bear was stalking up on the trooper and the civilian who . was assisting him, when they noticed it and killed it,"" Peters said. It wasn't immediately known if this was the bear involved in the mauling. The necropsy on the bear was completed Friday afternoon in Fairbanks, . said Cathie Harms, a biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and . Game. Measurements were taken for comparative purposes once the autopsy . on Weaver's body is completed in Anchorage. ""We'll know more, but we may or may not know that this bear was involved in the attack,"" she said. The bear necropsied was an adult male. They don't yet have an exact . age, but assume it was an older bear because of the great deal of wear . on its molars, she said. It had normal levels of fat, meaning it was not in a condition of . starvation, and did not have any apparent disease or infirmity, she . said. Terrified: Another person cowered in fear in the cabin while Robert Weaver was allegedly mauled to death by a bear . Harms stressed that it's not yet known if this was the bear involved in the attack, or if it was a black bear attack, at all. She said an attack by a bear is not common, even less so for black . bears. Fatalities by black bears are even more rare. In fact, Harms said . she could only find records for four deaths by a black bear in Alaska . for the last 61 years. The family member at the cabin with Weaver was his next of kin, . Peters said. That person, who wasn't identified, apparently was . uninjured but traumatized. ""We haven't done a follow-up interview yet with the person,"" Peters . said. ""They are understandably very, very upset by what happened."" ""Our heart goes out to the family,"" Harms said. ""It's a very sad situation and they have our sympathies."" It wasn't immediately known when authorities might be able to . interview the other family member to see if they can get more details . about what happened. Peters said the important thing to take away from this is attack is to be always prepared and alert. ""Any time that you are out in Alaska recreating, whether it's in your . backyard or out camping in rural Alaska, there's always a risk of . coming into contact with wildlife,"" she said. ""It doesn't matter if it's a black bear or a brown bear or a polar . bear, it doesn't matter the size, they are wild animals, and they are . dangerous,"" Peters said. She said people should familiarize themselves with safety tips on the . Alaska Department of Fish and Game's ""Living with Bears"" website: . http://is.gd/2S3ZWu . ""Alaskans live in bear habitat and if people pay attention to about . five basic rules, they can lessen their chance of an interaction or a . serious interaction with bears,"" Harms said.

"Chinese state media have been having their fun with America's protracted attempts to stave off a crippling default - even though it will likely come back to haunt them. Cartoons depicting the U.S. as a beggar and on a life-support machine have been cropping up in publications this week as the Republicans and Democrats scrambled to agree an extension to the debt ceiling before tomorrow's deadline. A Chinese minister has also accused the 'gentlemen' on Capitol Hill of showing little concern that their 'monkey business' had been damaging America's reputation around the world. Default dig: Cartoons like this one depicting the U.S. begging have been cropping up in Chinese state media . Mei Xinyu, who works in the Commerce Ministry and advises the Chinese government, warned that China will likely buy fewer U.S. Treasury Bonds to limit its exposure to the world's largest economy. It has already invested $1.3trillion in American debt. He told CBS News: 'Average Chinese believe (their) government is able to handle this situation and won't let it shipwreck China's economy.'

Financial markets had taken the prospect of a U.S. default in their stride - a confidence that proved to be well placed when the Republicans finally allowed the Democrat bill to go through, avoiding a default. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 174 points, or 1.2 percent, to 15,342 in early afternoon trading, following the announcement. Financial markets continued to take the prospect of a U.S. default in their stride today . The two houses of Congress still needed to vote on the deal, but signs were that it had enough support to go through, ending the weeks-long standoff and reopening the government. But the same issues - funding the government and raising the debt ceiling again - could come back in January and February, unless Democrats and Republicans agree before then on a long-term program to cut the deficit. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced a plan that would fund the government through January 15 and allow the Treasury to increase the nation's borrowing authority through February 7. Both the Democrat-controlled Senate and Republican-controlled House of Representatives must approve the plan, which President Barack Obama would then sign before Thursday's deadline for Congress to increase the federal debt limit.","Cartoons in Chinese state media ridicule US attempts to raise debt ceiling .

"The failed Great Escape mission was worth the human cost because it boosted the morale of the soldiers left behind in the Nazi prisoner of war camp, according to surviving veterans. Jack Lyon, 96, and Charles Clarke, 90, were young RAF officers shot down . in separate missions and imprisoned in the infamous Stalag Luft III camp during the . Second World War. Mr Lyon kept surveillance on the camp's Luftwaffe guards during . construction of escape tunnels and was waiting to make his getaway in . the early hours of March 25, 1944 when the daring mission was . discovered. Survivors: Jack Lyon, 96, (left) pictured with his RAF photo and prisoner of war identification tag, and Charles Clarke, 90, with his RAF medals, prisoner of war identification tag, and photo from his time in Bomber Command, say the Great Escape mission boosted the morale of prisoners of war . Once they were recaptured, 50 Allied PoWs were executed . by the Gestapo, but their astonishing bid for freedom from the camp, now then in south east Germany but now in Poland, was immortalised . on the silver screen in the 1963 film The Great Escape. 'It was a costly operation but not necessarily unsuccessful,' said Mr Lyon, who lives in East Sussex, speaking at a Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund event to mark the 70th anniversary of the mission. 'It did do a lot for morale, particularly for those prisoners who'd been there for a long time. Stalag Luft III survivor Jack Lyon as a young RAF officer . 'They felt they were able to contribute something, even if they weren't able to get out. 'They felt they could help in some way and trust me, in prison camps, morale is very important.' The veterans were joined for a special screening of the 1963 film by wilderness survival expert Ray Mears and comedian Al Murray. Mr Clarke, who lives in London, said: 'I think it's often forgotten that the Great Escape was probably one of the most audacious operations that the RAF carried out. 'When you see what was achieved with limited resources... When you think that all the equipment they had had to be made. The air pump was made of a kit bag and a few other bits. 'The air pipes were made of powdered milk tins, and even the little fat lamps were made of boiled margarine.' The plan for the Great Escape took shape in the spring of 1943 when Squadron Leader Roger Bushell RAF, who had been a lawyer in his civilian life, hatched a strategy for a major breakout. Bushell, who came to be known by the codename Big X, created an Escape Committee and inspired the camp's Allied prisoners in an attempt to get in excess of 200 out. Some 600 men helped dig three tunnels, which were referred to as Tom, Dick and Harry, with the hope that one would succeed. Tunnel Tom started in a darkened corner of one of the building's halls, while Dick's entrance was hidden in a washroom drain sump and Harry's was under a stove. The plan was for the escapees to come out the other end with civilian clothes, forged papers and escape equipment. On the night of March 24 to 25 March 1944, 76 men took advantage of a moonless night to attempt get away through tunnel Harry. Scene: The Stalag Luft III camp, where the Great Escape attempt took place in March 1944 . Route: The entrance to the famous 'Harry' escape tunnel originally built by Allied airmen at the prisoner of war camp . Of the 76 there were 73 who were recaptured by the Germans and most, including Big X, were executed on Hitler's orders . Steve McQueen led a star-studded cast which included Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, James Garner and Donald Pleasance in a dramatised version of the men's story two decades later. Speaking at the anniversary event in central London, RAF Benevolent Fund Controller Air Marshal Chris Nickols said it had been an honour to hear Mr Lyon and Mr Clarke's memories. He said: 'They remind us that The Great Escape is much more than a just a movie; it was a remarkable feat of courage and resourcefulness, which sadly resulted in 50 men being killed.' Silver screen: The story was made into the 1963 film The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen as Captain Virgil Hilts and Richard Attenborough as Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett . Reconstruction: Actors John Leyton and Charles Bronson make their way through one of the tunnels in the classic film . Fact vs fiction: Hilts' dash for the border by motorcycle in the film was added at the request of Steve McQueen . In the spring of 1943, RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bushell conceived a plan for a major escape from the German Stalag Luft III Camp near Sagan, now Żagań in Poland. With the escape planned for the night of March 24, 1944, the PoWs built three 30ft deep tunnels, named Tom, Dick and Harry, so that if one was discovered by the German guards, they would not suspect that work was underway on two more. Bushell intended to get more than 200 men through the tunnels, each wearing civilian clothes and possessing a complete range of forged papers and escape equipment. To hide the earth dug from the tunnels the prisoners attached pouches of the sand inside their trousers so that as they walked around it would scatter. The prisoners wore greatcoats to conceal the bulges made by the sand and were referred to as 'penguins' because of their supposed resemblance to the animal. When the attempt began it was discovered that Harry had come up short and instead of reaching into a nearby forest, the first man in fact emerged just short of the tree line, close to a guard tower. Plans for one man to leave every minute was reduced to 10 per hour. In total 76 men crawled through to initial freedom, but the 77th was spotted by a guard. In the hunt for the entrance one guard Charlie Pilz crawled through the tunnel but after becoming trapped at the other end called for help. The prisoners opened the entrance, revealing the location. Of the escapees 73 were captured, and 50 of them executed.THE HOLLYWOOD FILMThe 1963 film The Great Escape was based on real events, and although some characters were fictitious many were based on real people, or amalgams of several of those involved. The film starred Steve McQueen as Captain Virgil Hilts, James Garner as Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley and Richard Attenborough as Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, and was based on a book of the same name by Paul Brickhill. Contrary to the film no American PoWs were involved in the escape attempt, and there were no escapes by motorcycle or aircraft. Hilts' dash for the border by motorcycle was added by request of McQueen, who did the stunt riding himself except for the final jump.","Jack Lyon and Charles Clarke were imprisoned at the Stalag Luft III camp .

"Bill De Blasio, the first Democrat elected mayor of New York City in a generation, is a Massachusetts-raised former supporter of the communist Sandinistas who married a lesbian poet. And he's a lifelong Boston Red Sox fan. De Blasio's path to becoming the leader of America's largest city was unorthodox - especially compared with his Democratic predecessors. He rose up the ranks of Democratic politics. He worked as a junior aide to the last Democratic mayor, David Dinkins. He served in the Clinton Administration and ran Hillary Clinton's 2000 bid for the U.S. Senate. He served three years as a Democrat on the City Council. But he is not necessarily a product of the party political machine like previous Democratic mayors - in part because that machinery no longer exists in the way it once did. Partners: Bill De Blasio's marriage to Cirlane McCray, a former lesbian, was a major development in De Blasio's ride to power. The couple are seen today after their landslide victory . Landslide: Bill De Blasio cruised to victory on Tuesday night - becoming the first Democratic mayor in a generation . Rising star: De Blasio worked in the Clinton Administration and managed the 2000 senate campaign of Hillary Clinton . Childhood in Cambridge, Massachusetts . De . Blasio was born Warren Wilhelm, Jr. in Manhattan in to an . Italian-American mother and a German American father. For reasons . unknown, he has always gone by Bill. Both . were highly-educated - Warren Wilhelm Sr. had degrees from both . Harvard and Yale and Maria De Blasio went to Smith College. Before De Blasio was born, both his . parents had worked for the federal government, but had to flee . Washington after being accused of being communists. When De Blasio was a few years old, the family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, home of Harvard University. He . lived outside Boston until attending college at New York University. One result of his Massachusetts upbringing: He's as fan of the Boston . Red Sox - the arch-rivals of New York's hometown baseball team, the . Yankees. But life in the Wilhelm house was not . happy. His father was a war hero who lost a leg to a Japanese grenade . while serving in the Pacific during the Second World War. When . De Blasio was seven, his father suddenly left the family. Warren Sr. was battling alcoholism, which De Blasio believes was a result of the . horrors he saw in war. In 1979, when De Blasio was still a teenager, Warren Sr. committed suicide. After his father's death, he changed his last name from Wilhelm to his mother's maiden name: De Blasio. He . told New York magazine: 'She was often very, very sad about thing that . had happened to her, but she had a fierce resilience - a very sharp and . purposeful resilience. She was very practical.' New York City has been without a First . Lady for nearly all of the 21st Century, so New Yorkers have welcomed . the presence of Bill De Blasio's wife Chirlane McCray on the campaign . trail. But, De Blasio himself has promised that McCray will be unlike any First Lady the city has ever seen. 'All I can say is buckle your seat belt. Get ready for Chirlane McCray,' he told a crowd last month, according to the New York Daily News. McCray will, indeed, be different the the other spouses who have lived in Gracie Mansion. For starters, she's a black former lesbian. When . her family moved to Longmeadow, Massacushuetts, where she grew up, they . were the second black family in the area and neighbors started a . petition to get them to move out. She attended in Wellesley College and moved to New York to work in publishing. In . 1979, she write a story in Essence magazine titled 'I am a Lesbian.' The piece is still celebrated by gay and lesbian leaders for working to . dispel the myth that there were not homosexuals in the black community. She was an aide to Mayor David Dinkins in 1991, when she met De Blasio, who was a deputy mayor's aide. 'The way Bill describes it, I walked in with my African dress and my nose ring, and he heard choirs singing,' McCray told New Yorker. 'I did not have that experience.' Eventually she showed him the Essen article she wrote. De Blasio wasn't deterred. He persisted in courting her and McCray said she fell in love. They married two years later in 1994. Daughter Chiara was born six months later. De Blasio has promised that his wife would take an active role. She was an ever-present face on the campaign trail - along with the couple two children, 18-year-old Chiara and 16-year-old Dante. The Daily News reports that she also helped vet staffers. She is expected the play a large role in his administration. 'If you want to understand me, understand Chirlane,' he told the newspaper. Greetings from Italy . Maria De Blasio was from Southern Italy and De Blasio still speaks Italian - he even uttered a few words of Italian during his victory speech Tuesday night in Brooklyn. Meanwhile, in Sant'Agata de' Goti, Italy, his maternal grandfather's hometown, villagers gathered to celebrate De Blasio's victory. The mayor of the town of 11,000 said he hopes that one day the Mayor of New York will visit the small hamlet outside Naples. International appeal: The mayor of Sant'Agata de' Goti in Italy, De Blasio's grandfather's hometown, celebrated the victory from Europe . Italians in De Blasio's ancestral hometown gathered to celebrate the victory of the half-Italian-American . Supporting a brutal socialist regime . When De Blasio was in the college in the 1980s, he made a trip to Nicaragua. The Central American nation was in the midst of a bloody civil war between the Soviet-backed socialist Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed rightist Contras. De Blasio initially said he visited the capital of Managua on a relief mission to hand out supplies to war refugees. However, once there, he grew to admire the socialist regime, which President Ronald Reagan was attempting to help overthrow. On his return, he joined the Nicaragua Solidarity Movement of Greater New York, which had a goal to 'end capitalism, replace with democratic socialism.' Towering: At 6-foot-5, De Blasio is likely the tallest man ever elected to be mayor. He is taller even than Abraham Lincoln, who was just 6-foot-4 . De Blasio and McCray married in 1994. It has been reported that they honeymooned in communist Cuba . His support for the Sandinistas, who were accused of slaughtering hundreds of innocent civilians and 'disappearing' political opponents, became an issue on the campaign trail. Republican Joe Lohda told WCBS-TV: 'Mr De Blasio’s involvement with the Sandinistas didn’t happen in 1917; it happened 70 years later when the cruelty and intrinsic failure of communism had become crystal clear to anyone with a modicum of reason. Mr De Blasio’s class warfare strategy in New York City is directly out of the Marxist playbook. Now we know why.' But De Blasio didn't shy away from his past political views, saying he was 'very proud' of his activism on Nicaragua. 'I think at that time, United States policy towards Central America was wrong,' he said in September. 'I think most Americans came to believe it was wrong. I was proud to be an activist working against it.' It was also revealed that in 1994, he and his wife Chirlane McCray honeymooned in communist Cuba - at a time when it was illegal for Americans to travel there. It was a fact that De Blasio and McCray didn't even tell their two teenage children. A political fixer goes public . De Blasio has been interested in politics his whole life. In high school, he was nicked named 'Senator Provolone,' a nod to both his Italian heritage and his love of student government. He attended New York University, where he led student protests to keep the library open longer and oppose tuition hikes. He went on to earn a Masters of International Affairs from Columbia University. In 1989, he joined the campaign for Mayor David Dinkins as a volunteer. His hard work was rewarded with a posting as an aide to a deputy mayor in the Dinkins administration. It was there that he met his wife, who is six years older and was a speechwriter for Dinkins at the time. After working on the re-election campaign for President Bill Clinton, he was appointed as a regional director for federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. In that director, he was the highest-ranking HUD official in the New York and New Jersey area. In 2000, the Clintons tapped him to run Hillary's U.S. Senate campaign. The next year, De Blasio stepped out of the shadows for the first time and ran for public office himself. He won a crowded primary for the 39th district in Brooklyn with 32percent of the vote. After serving three terms - including one in which he was the leader of the Brooklyn coalition, he won city-wide office as Public Advocate.","Bill De Blasio is a political insider who worked on campaigns of Bill and Hillary Clinton .

"When we suffer a scary experience we can often feel that the smell of fear is in the air. And scientists have discovered that we’re right – as our sense of smell becomes much more active when we’re frightened. Therefore, whatever we can smell when we’re feeling fearful is absorbed into our memories and the same emotion is triggered whenever the aroma returns. American scientists think our sense of smell becomes more active when we are scared and our nostrils become an early warning system. They believe sensory cells learn to associate some smells with fear - even before the message has reached the brain . The study’s researchers from Rutgers . University in New Jersey say the finding could be used to find . treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder, in which senses can . trigger an attack. They developed the new theory after testing the . brain activity of mice. Using electric shocks, they implanted fear . memories associated with particular smells. When the same ones were . wafted towards the mice again, the smell receptors became four times as . active. The findings suggest that our senses act as a ‘warning signal’ for dangerous situations. Neurologists . think smells trigger memories because the olfactory nerve – which . carries messages from the nostrils to the brain – is located very close . to the amygdala and hippocampus, the areas connected to emotional . memory. Dr John McGann, author of the paper published in the journal Science, suggested the results will transform the way neurologists think about smell. He said scientists had previously assumed that sensory organs - including the eyes, nose and ears – are simply detectors, and the brain works out what the messages mean. Dr McGann said the research could be used for treatments for anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (illustrated), in which senses including smells can trigger an attack . ‘In the old model the eye is like a camera, the ear like a microphone, the nose like a chemistry lab, and the job of the brain is to analyse this information,’ Dr McGann said. The new research, however, suggests that smell sensors adapt independently of the brain, increasing their activity when they first detect the ‘scary’ smells. The findings suggest that senses act as a ‘warning signal’ for dangerous situations, even before they reach the brain. Dr McGann added: ‘In this study we watched the activity of the very first neurons of the mouse olfactory system - which controls the sense of smell - and found to our surprise that the activity of those cells not only indicated what odours are present in the nose but also increased their response when the mouse learned that a particular odour predicted they would receive an electric shock. The new research suggests that smell sensors adapt independently of the brain, increasing their activity when they first detect the 'scary' smells. The findings hint that senses act as a 'warning signal' for dangerous situations, even before they reach the brain . ‘This is surprising for two reasons - first, because it shows that the sensory system was incorporating information about the emotional value of specific odours at the input to the brain before the brain had a chance to interpret it. ‘Second, because we tend to think of learning as something that happens deep in the brain after conscious awareness, but the new data show that even the earliest neurons in the sensory system can be changed as a result of learning.’ Dr McGann said the research could be used for treatments for anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder, in which senses including smells can trigger an attack. Neurologists think that smells trigger memories because the olfactory nerve, which carries messages from the nostrils to the brain, is located very close to the amygdala and hippocampus, the areas of the brain connected to emotional memory.","New research suggests sensory cells learn to associate some smells with fear - even before the message has reached the brain .

"Katie Holmes' lawyer has confirmed her highly-publicised divorce with Tom Cruise has been settled, as reports emerge she will have 'sole custody' of their six-year-old daughter Suri. It seems the couple have reached an agreement out of court, meaning the actor's beloved Scientology is no longer at risk of scrutiny with the religion's secrets being dissected during a trial. Jonathan Wolfe said: 'This case has been settled and the agreement has been signed.' Speaking to TMZ, he added: 'We are thrilled for Katie and her family and are excited to watch as she embarks on the next chapter of her life. Scroll down for video . Life in the spotlight: As she released a joint statement with estranged . husband Tom Cruise regarding the dissolution of their marriage, and her lawyer confirmed a settlement, Katie Holmes seemed to be in high spirits . 'We thank Tom's counsel for their professionalism and diligence that helped bring about this speedy resolution'. According to TMZ, while Katie has sole custody of Suri, Tom will still get significant custodial time with his daughter. Apparently the agreement also includes details on what Tom and Katie are allowed to tell Suri regarding religion, including Scientology. The restrictions are eased as Suri gets older, the website reports. A separate source, speaking to Radar, also revealed that Suri will remain with Katie in New York, where they currently reside, and will be accompanied by her own nanny and team of bodyguards when she visits father Tom on weekly occasions. However an insider who spoke to TMZ has disputed this. The insider told Radar: 'Katie insisted that Suri's nanny and bodyguards always accompany her when she visits Tom... This will ensure a smooth and easy transition for Suri when she is with Tom. Camera shy: The usually-attention loving Suri hid her face beneath a blanket as she stepped out the car . 'Suri is Katie's number one priority. Tom only has Scientologists that work for him and Katie insisted that . her staff will always be with their daughter. 'Under . terms of the settlement, Suri isn't permitted to be exposed to anything . Scientology related and this includes going to any Scientology . churches, parties, etc. Katie made sure that this was ironclad.' Suri . will also not be expected to attend a Scientology school, like Cruise’s . adopted children with ex-wife Nicole Kidman, Isabella, now 19, and . Conor, 17, did. Fingers began pointing even before reasons of their split came to surface. And . earlier today, the rumours circulating their difference in religious opinion, . notably the Cocktail actor's rigid Scientology beliefs, appear to have . been confirmed in a joint statement from the couple. Released by their representatives, the notice states that they will continue to work together as parents and 'express our respect for each other's commitment to each of our respective beliefs'. The show goes on: Tom was pictured on the set of Oblivion today after flying into Mammoth Lake Airport, California, in the wake of the divorce settlement . It's . also quite the paradox they have asked for privacy, considering the . charade Tom displayed with his infamous jumping on the sofa as a . declaration of love for Katie during an interview with Oprah. The . formerly named TomKat reached their divorce settlement today - filed . unexpectedly by Katie in the last week of June - and would have been . fighting for custody of their six-year-old daughter Suri. The statement, released today, said: 'We are . committed to working together as parents to accomplish what is in our . daughter Suri's best interests. 'We want to keep matters affecting our . family private and express our respect for each other's commitment to . each of our respective beliefs and support each other's roles as . parents.' One Hollywood source said that Cruise, 50, had agreed to pay a 'substantial' sum to his soon-to-be third ex-wife in property, assets and child support. A pre-nuptial agreement is said to have limited the amount he was obliged to pay, but sources say he would almost certainly have included a 'goodwill' payoff to help bring talks to a speedy conclusion. New favourite haunt: Katie and Suri returned to the Children's Musuem of the Arts after visiting last week . Yesterday, 33-year-old Katie was seen enjoying a girls day out with her daughter. She looked confident within herself, . smiling for photographers while dressed casually in a double denim . ensemble of flared jeans and a shirt with the sleeves rolled up. The pair were seen taking a taxi to . the Children's Museum of the Arts, which seems to be a new favourite . with the child after they were spotted at the same venue last week with a . group of friends. To coincide with the joint statement, more evidence has emerged that Katie had . been planning to leave Tom for months before making the . announcement on June 29. A new report has claimed that she . made the decision to fire Cruise's 19-year-old daughter Bella two months previously as . she worked for the actress' clothing line Holmes and Yang. A source told the Hollywood Reporter that while Bella was stunned by the news, it has all started to make sense in the wake of the divorce announcement. The source said: 'There was never any . trouble between them. Bella called Katie ""Mom."" She was fired out of . the blue, and once Katie filed for divorce, it all made sense. 'This was a carefully planned ambush. Katie didn’t want Bella working for her anymore because she was Tom’s kid.' 'Carefully planned ambush': Katie Holmes fired Tom Cruise's daughter Bella, seen here with the actress in 2010, two months ago when she was working for her clothing line Holmes and Yang, it has been claimed . The . decision to fire Bella was one of the first attempts Katie made to . stand up to Cruise and the religious organisation of Scientology, of . which the actor is a very vocal member. Happier times: Katie is said to have been planning her split from Cruise for months . Tom's lawyer, Bert Fields, said of the agreement: 'Tom is really pleased we got there, and so am I.' Katie filed for divorce under the names 'Anonymous vs Anonymous' - signalling her intention of trying to keep details private. Karen De La Carriere, a former Scientology executive who had been married to Scientology's president Heber Jentzsch, who has been missing for years, told the publication that Katie's move was extremely courageous. She said: 'This was a very bold move on Katie’s part, but at the same time she knows these are different times and she has more support. 'Katie ambushed Tom and in so . doing outwitted some of the most controlling people on Earth.' Ex-Scientologist Marty Rathbun claimed that the actor and church leadership wanted to 'buy silence at any price'. He said the agreement is likely to contain a clause 'that indicates Scientology was never an issue nor consideration in the filing for divorce'. Marc Headley, who was aided by police when he left the church in . 2005, said: 'You're either in or out when it comes to Scientology. 'That’s why Katie is making custody such an issue in the divorce . petition. If you’re out, the way she seems to be, they want to cut you . off from everyone, including your kids.' And with art imitating life, Katie begins shooting Molly next month - a film about a single mother. Custody battle: Katie is believed to have filed for sole custody of the pair's six-year-old daughter Suri . <!-- . /* Font Definitions */ . @font-face . {font-family:""ＭＳ 明朝""; . panose-1:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; . mso-font-charset:128; . mso-generic-font-family:roman; . mso-font-format:other; . mso-font-pitch:fixed; . mso-font-signature:1 134676480 16 0 131072 0;} . @font-face . {font-family:""Cambria Math""; . panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; . mso-font-charset:0; . mso-generic-font-family:auto; . mso-font-pitch:variable; . mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;} . @font-face . {font-family:Cambria; . panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; . mso-font-charset:0; . mso-generic-font-family:auto; . mso-font-pitch:variable; . mso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;} . /* Style Definitions */ . p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal . {mso-style-unhide:no; . mso-style-qformat:yes; . mso-style-parent:""""; . margin:0cm; . margin-bottom:.0001pt; . mso-pagination:widow-orphan; . font-size:12.0pt; . font-family:Cambria; . mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; . mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; . mso-fareast-font-family:""ＭＳ 明朝""; . mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; . mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; . mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; . mso-bidi-font-family:""Times New Roman""; . mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; . mso-ansi-language:EN-US;} . .MsoChpDefault . {mso-style-type:export-only; . mso-default-props:yes; . font-family:Cambria; . mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; . mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; . mso-fareast-font-family:""ＭＳ 明朝""; . mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; . mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; . mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; . mso-bidi-font-family:""Times New Roman""; . mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; . mso-ansi-language:EN-US;} . @page WordSection1 . {size:612.0pt 792.0pt; . margin:72.0pt 90.0pt 72.0pt 90.0pt; . mso-header-margin:36.0pt; . mso-footer-margin:36.0pt; . mso-paper-source:0;} . div.WordSection1 . {page:WordSection1;} . --> .

"The Duchess of Cornwall said she has been moved to 'see behind the veil' during her three-day trip to Saudi Arabia. Speaking during a visit to a female-only centre which offers training and job opportunities this morning, Camilla said she believed huge strides had been made in empowering women since she last visited almost six years ago. The Mail's Royal Correspondent was the only journalist allowed to accompany the Duchess on her tour to the centre in Jeddah and she told us exclusively afterwards: 'I've noticed from the last visit I made here in 2006 - five, six years ago now - a sea of change. The Duchess of Cornwall was given a drink after arriving at the Bab Rizq Jameel Nafisa Shams Female Academy for Arts and Crafts in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia . 'Talking to all the women, they tell me they feel the difference too. 'They are in a world that can see and is starting to recognise their talents. 'I think one of the great examples is the king giving access to the ladies in parliament. I think that has made a huge difference.' Camilla continued: 'There is more and more progress all the time. '[This time] I have had much more of a chance to meet so many women from so many different walks of life - from the women of the Shura [the Saudi parliament], to these wonderful entrepreneurs you see around us here. The Duchess of Cornwall visited the Bab Rizq Jameel Nafisa Shams Female Academy for Arts and Crafts in Jeddah . 'It's extraordinary to have the opportunity to see behind the veils. It's been the most remarkable experience.' The role of women in society has been the main theme of the duchess’s visit to the country. Saudi women have few rights and are required, regardless of age, to have a male guardian - typically a father or husband – who must give their permission for everything from opening a bank account to marriage. They cannot vote or be elected to high office and are prohibited from driving. In 2011 a woman from Jeddah was sentenced to ten lashes by whip after being caught behind the wheel. Women are also required to be segregated from men in public. Most offices, banks and universities have separate entrances and they are required to sit separately on public transport and in restaurants. When it comes to dress, women are also expected to cover all parts of the body that are 'awrah' - not meant to be exposed. Saudi Arabia’s strict interpretation . of Islam means they must cover their entire body with a black cloak . known as an abaya and headcovering, or hijab, leaving just the eyes and . the hands exposed. Conventions . for dress and behaviour are all fiercely enforced by the notorious . religious police, or mutaween, whose official title is the Commission . for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. As . a member of the British royal family, Camilla is not required to wear . an abaya - but has chosen to dress 'demurely' as a mark of respect to . her hosts. The duchess has . already visited Riyadh's women-only university and met with some of the . country's 30 new female MPs to highlight some of the steps Saudi women . are taking towards equality. Today . she was at the Bab Rizq Jameel Nafisa Shams Female Academy for Arts and . Crafts, which provides training and job opportunities for Saudi women. She was greeted by Mohammed Abdul Latif Jameel, the . chairman of the Abdul Latif Jameel Community Initiatives, and was given . a tour of the training centre, starting upstairs with the beauty and . fashion workshops. The area is very much women-only with even the duchess’s male bodyguards forced to wait downstairs. One of the classes she watched was on how to apply wedding make-up. 'Would you like to open your own salon?' she asked one of the women. 'I think there is a real demand for this. After all, wherever you are in the world, women like to look nice, don't they?' She also chatted to women learning seamstress skills and creating exquisite Western-influenced clothes. 'It makes me feel so inadequate,' she joked. 'My Home Economics classes were a disaster. I never got past making a circular skirt.' Camilla examined jewellery made by women at the female-only training centre in Jeddah this morning . The duchess also met women having a cooking lesson at the centre . Afterwards she walked to a more public area where women are taught how to make prayer mats, jewellery and cupcakes - where she watched veiled ladies creating exquisite handmade chocolates and was even persuaded one or two - 'Or three,' she joked. 'I never thought I would say it but I don't think I can face any more chocolate.' The duchess completed her visit by viewing an exhibition space where a wide range of products made by the women - including soaps, cushions, prayer beads and abayas - are displayed and sold. She chatted at length with mother-of-four Nahed Qaqad, 34, who has started Violet, a firm making wedding and christening decorations and gifts. 'I just don't know how you find the time to do all this with your family,' she said. 'You are truly amazing.' Veiled Nahed told her: 'My husband is very supportive of me and my daughters help. I want them to grow up knowing they can do something like this. The business is small but I hope it will grow.' The Bab Rizq Jameel project provides vocational training programmes in collaboration with government institutions, with students selected and financed for three to six month intensive development courses. It has already created over 190,000 job opportunities throughout Saudi Arabia. Prince . Charles, meanwhile, visited the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and . met with British executives involved in plans to redevelop the King . Abdulaziz International Airport and build a new rail terminal  designed . to absorb the enormous flow of Muslims pilgrims travelling to and from . nearby Mecca. The couple’s . visit to Saudi Arabia is of huge importance to the British Government in . terms of diplomatic, trade and military links, but was always going to . prove controversial because of the country’s human rights record. Their . visit, which started on Friday, saw them arrive at the centre of an . international human rights outcry, with pressure groups calling on . Prince Charles to voice his disapproval at the controversial public . execution of seven men on Wednesday. The role of women in society has been the main theme of the duchess¿s visit to the country . Camilla also sampled homemade chocolates at the centre and joked she might have one, or two, or three . Prince Charles visited the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on his final day in Saudi Arabia and met OIC Secretary General Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu . The victims, who had been convicted of armed robbery, died at the hands of a ‘humane’ firing squad as the country is, according to reports, struggling to find enough executioners to carry out traditional beheadings. Two of the group were juveniles when they were charged before being detained for more than three years. All were said to have been subjected to torture in order to illicit confessions and denied legal representation in court. One of the men was due to be crucified after his death, with his body tied to a pole in a public square to act as a deterrent to others. The British Government has already voiced its anger with the Foreign Office’s Minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, saying: ‘The UK opposes as a matter of principle all use of the death penalty, whatever the crime committed. 'The alleged circumstances surrounding the executions cause enormous damage to Saudi Arabia’s reputation internationally.’ Amnesty International also called on Charles, who enjoys a close relationship with many senior members of the ruling Saudi Royal Family, to use his influence to raise the issue at the highest level. ‘Prince Charles has always had the tip of his well-polished brogues in the political world and he should use his influence to tell the royal House of Saud a few home truths about the country’s dreadful human rights record,’  said Kate Allen, Amnesty's UK director. ‘Surely, arriving in the wake of . controversial executions and the jailing of human rights activists, . Charles will want to at least broach these matters?’ Although . Clarence House have declined to comment publicly, diplomatic sources . say Charles was likely to discuss reform in Saudi Arabia with the . country’s future ruler, Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz. ‘The . reason why the government is keen for the prince to come here is that . he enjoys a very different relationship with the Saudi Royal Family to . that of the government. He can get things done in a way the politicians . frankly can’t,’ they said. Charles and Camilla flew to Oman for the final leg of their tour this afternoon and were greeted by His Highness Sayyid Haitham Bin Al Said, the Omani Minister of Heritage and Culture . Camilla met dignitaries on arrival at Oman International Airport on the seventh day of a Middle East tour . Charles and Camilla were welcomed by the Sultan of Oman, Qaboos bin Said Al Saidat, at his palace at Bayt al Baraka . Saudi Arabia is one of five states in the world to conduct public executions and has the widest number of crimes punishable by death, including murder, rape, sodomy, robbery, theft (after four offences), false prophecy and witchcraft. According to Amnesty International at least 17 people, including eight foreign nationals, have already been executed this year. These include including Sri Lankan domestic worker Rizana Nafeek, who was accused of killing a baby in her care when she was just 17 but claimed to have confessed under duress.

"British men, rest easy. This summer, cougars are going on tour and they're heading for the Mediterranean. A poll of female members of CougarLife.com, the dating site for women of a certain age looking for younger men, shows that British cougars can't get enough of Spain. And it seems that Barcelona is their favourite hunting ground. With 19 per cent of the votes, the Spanish city topped the list. On the prowl: Mature women like Jules Cobb (played by Courtney Cox in U.S. sitcom Cougar Town) are flocking to Barcelona for the summer . These cougars' visits won't just be about taking in the sun, sea and sangria. Sight-seeing will also be on the to-do list (though maybe not the traditional sort). The survey reveals that a majority of the women polled plan on seeing some action. 70 per cent hope to 'hook-up' with younger men while on their holiday. And they know who they want: 53 per cent intend to pounce on hotel or activity staff, while just over half have the hots for tennis and golf instructors. Miss CougarLife.com's Marlo Jordan, voted in as the site's ultimate cougar, said, 'For cougars like myself who enjoy flirting with young attractive men, Spain is one fabulous playground so I’m not surprised it took the number one spot for women looking for their dream cub.' Sight-seeing: Cougars will want to take in the sights of Barcelona, but 70% also aim to 'hook-up' with younger men . The business owner and dating coach added, 'We like luxury, spas, beach-front cocktails and handsome Mediterranean men who appreciate mature woman and are not shy of expressing themselves.' With 17 per cent of the vote, the Canary Islands were also popular with the survey's 1,043 respondents.

"Security has been tightened at Manila’s international airport after Philippine authorities arrested three men and foiled an alleged plot to set off homemade bombs at the airport and other locations. Four incendiary devices were found inside the suspects’ van at a car park at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, officials announced on Tuesday. While holidaymakers are noticing tighter security precautions following the threat, airport operations remain normal and there are no reports of any domestic or international flight delays due to the heightened level of caution. Extra security: A bomb-sniffing dog inspects a package at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila . Busted: Philippine authorities say three men were plotting to attack the airport and other locations in Manila . The Manila International Airport Authority assured locals and visitors that all of the country's airports are safe for travellers. In response to the threat, plainclothes and uniformed officers are guarding entrances, K9 units are patrolling terminals to detect explosives and authorities have increased inspections of vehicles entering the airport. The alleged plot unravelled when government agents were tipped off by an informant, although the country’s military is downplaying the threat and claiming the men are ‘pranksters’ who were just seeking attention. The men have been linked to an anti-China group, which calls itself Usafe. They are also accused of planning attacks against the Chinese Embassy in Manila and a major shopping centre that has ethnic Chinese owners. Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said the ‘ultra-rightist’ but ‘misguided group’ is angry because it believes the Philippine government is taking a ‘very soft’ stance in its territorial dispute with China. The suspects, including the group’s alleged leader, are now facing charges of illegal possession of a firearm and an incendiary device, the Wall Street Journal reported. High alert: Security measures were tightened at Manila's international airport after the plot was thwarted . The men could face charges of conspiracy to commit terrorism, authorities said. Rommel Vallejo, head of the Anti-Organized Crime Division of the National Bureau of Investigation, said the firebombs consisted of a firecracker as big as the palm of hand with an eight-second wick taped to a plastic bottle containing gasoline. De Lima said the blast from one of the devices could create a huge fireball and send debris flying 15 to 30ft, which could cause fatal injuries.

"Cancer is set to overtake heart disease and stroke as Britain's biggest killer, experts are predicting. The number of deaths from cardiovascular disease has dropped across the country and most of Europe, scientists have found. And a 'tipping point' is approaching when deaths from stroke and heart disease will be outnumbered by fatalities due to cancer - especially among men. The number of deaths from cardiovascular disease has dropped across the country and most of Europe, scientists have found . Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has declined across most of the continent, but the rates of deaths vary enormously from western to eastern Europe, researchers found. In Britain,the CVD death rates for 2010 were 205 and 129 per 100,000 men and women respectively. Researchers found that in some Eastern European countries, including Russia and Ukraine, the death rate from coronary heart disease for 55 to 60-year-olds is greater than the equivalent rate for people from France who are twenty years older. Scientists said that CVD remains the single, greatest cause of death among Europeans than any other disease, and, in many countries causes twice as many deaths as cancer. But researchers found there were some countries where cancer was now already causing more deaths than heart disease in men. The countries included Belgium, Denmark, France, Israel, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal Slovenia, Spain and San Marino. The research was led by Dr Melanie Nichols, of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) Centre on Population Approaches for Non-Communicable Disease Prevention at the University of Oxford. Researchers found there were some countries where cancer was now already causing more deaths than heart disease in men (file picture) She said cancer had also overtaken CVD as the main cause of death among women in one European country - Denmark. The report's co-author Dr Nick Townsend, said: 'The reason why cancer has overtaken cardiovascular disease as the main cause of death in these countries is due to the fact that fewer people develop cardiovascular disease and, in those who do, fewer die from it. 'This is probably due to improvements in the behavioural risk factors associated with CVD, such as decreases in the number of people smoking tobacco, along with better treatments, including preventive ones, such as the increasing use of statins. 'However, increases in some risk factors, such as rising levels of obesity, suggest that these decreasing trends may be in danger of reversing.' Dr Nichols and her colleagues in the Oxford research group looked at trends in deaths from CVD over a period of ten years analysing data for 52 out of 53 European countries - there was no data available for Andorra. Researchers said that data from the latest available year showed that there were just over four million deaths, 1.9 million men and 2.2 million women, from CVD, close to half of all deaths in Europe. Heart disease is still killing three times as many women than breast cancer despite declining death rates across Europe - a 'stark reminder' for them to live a healthier lifestyle, said the British Heart Foundation. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the charity and board member of the European Heart Network, said: 'It is good news the number of lives being taken too soon by cardiovascular disease is falling across Europe. Heart disease is still killing three times as many women as breast cancer despite declining death rates across Europe, research has found (file picture) 'However, the fact remains heart disease and stroke remain the biggest cause of death among Europeans. 'Perhaps surprisingly, more women are dying from cardiovascular disease than men. 'These figures are a stark reminder that women need to be more aware of their heart health as heart disease kills almost three times as many women as breast cancer. 'We have made huge progress in the fight against heart disease and stroke. 'It is only because of the medical breakthroughs the BHF funds, with the help of our generous supporters, that we are finding newer, better ways to prevent, treat and cure heart disease. 'But there is still a long way to go if we want to narrow the unacceptable gap in survival rates across Europe.' This was made up of 1.8 million deaths from coronary heart disease, one million from cerebrovascular disease (stroke) and 1.2 million from other cardiovascular diseases. Researchers said that just under a million men died before the age of 75 and half a million before the age of 65. Half a million women died before the age of 75 and just over 200,000 before the age of 65. Three in every ten deaths of Europeans aged under 65 were caused by CVD, as were 3 per cent of all deaths occurring before the age of 75 . Dr Townsend said: 'The proportion of women who die from cardiovascular disease is much greater than men - 51 per cent of women died compared to 42 per cent of men. In Britain,the Cardiovascular disease death rates for 2010 were 205 and 129 per 100,000 men and women respectively . 'This difference is driven mainly by a higher rate of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases among women. 'There was very little difference in the rates of coronary heart disease between men and women - 20 per cent versus 21 per cent respectively.' Researchers said that CVD death rates are declining in most, but not all European countries. They added that trends have also been downwards for what are known as 'case fatality rates' - the percentage of people who are diagnosed with a condition and die from the illness within a given period. In their paper, the authors say: 'Worldwide, there have been few moments in history during which NCDs [non-communicable diseases] have enjoyed such a prominent place in the world's attention, with cardiovascular disease at the forefront of the activity. 'Despite this, there has been little commitment at the national or regional level to greater monitoring and reporting of risk factors and outcomes for cardiovascular disease. 'It is clear that in many countries of Europe, CVD mortality has continued to decrease substantially in recent years, and will make a large contribution to achieving this goal. 'In these (predominantly high income) countries, a ""tipping point"" is rapidly approaching, when cancer deaths will outnumber cardiovascular disease deaths, particularly among men. 'In many other countries, however, the CVD burden dwarfs that of cancer, and a large proportion of the populations will lose their lives prematurely to heart disease and stroke.' The research was published in the European Heart Journal.","Cancer set to overtake cardiovascular disease as Britain's biggest killer .

"Russian cosmonauts could be living on the Moon by 2030 under leaked plans drawn up by the country's space agency. A draft government programme proposes a three-step plan to explore the Moon that would culminate in building a permanent Earth-monitoring observatory. The document stressed the urgency of getting there before other nations, saying 'leading space powers will expand and establish their rights to convenient lunar footholds' in the next 20 to 30 years. Red dawn? Russian cosmonauts could be living on the Moon by 2030 and use local resources to build Earth- and space-monitoring observatories, according to plans drawn up by the Kremlin and Russia's space agency . Moscow's plans, seen by Russian broadsheet Izvestia and reported in translation by the Moscow Times, call for a robotic craft to be sent to the Moon by 2016, with a manned mission by 2028. The final stage of the plan is for cosmonauts to use local resources to build an initial Moon base by 2030, followed by the construction of space- and Earth-monitoring observatories. With Nasa's sights apparently firmly set on Mars, despite struggling against years of funding cuts, Russia appears to have a relatively open field in the newest leg of the space race. The Kremlin has fired the starting pistol on its new space race less than three years after the U.S. was forced to start hitching flights on Russian rockets. Nasa ended its space shuttle programme in 2011 and has faced years of funding cuts. Just last month a Soyuz rocket carried two Russian cosmonauts and a U.S. astronaut to the International Space Station (above), despite the crisis in Ukraine and tough talking on sanctions. China, Japan and India have all announced their intention to launch fresh missions to the Moon, which was last visited by humans in 1976. But Russia's space programme, which achieved the first manned space flight in 1961, is far ahead and is the only one to explicitly call for manned lunar missions. Just a fortnight ago, the Roscosmos announced plans for the massive new 'super-rockets' capable of lifting payloads of up to 120 tonnes into space. The latest report was prepared by by the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Roscosmos federal space agency, Moscow State University and several space research institutes. It envisages international cooperation but stresses the 'independence of the national lunar programme must be ensured regardless of the conditions and extend of participation by foreign partners.' The document appears to be an . expansion on plans to first set out by Moscow last month, when deputy PM . Dmitry Rogozin dramatically announced: 'We are coming to the Moon . forever.' The final frontier: A Russian Soyuz rocket takes off for the International Space Station last month. The Kremlin has announced plans to build a super-heavy carrier rocket that could propel its cosmonauts to the Moon . In an article in the government's own newspaper headlined 'Russian Space', he spoke of targeting Mars and other 'space objects' as future priorities. 'Flights to Mars and asteroids in our view do not contradict exploration of the moon, but in many senses imply this process.' 'We are coming to the Moon forever': Russian deputy PM Dmitry Rogozin first outlined his country's plans for lunar exploration and colonisation last month . He wrote of 'colonisation of the moon and near-moon space'. In the next 50 years, manned flights are unlikely beyond 'the space between Venus and Mars'. But 'it is quite possible to speak about exploration of Mars, flights to asteroids and flights to Mars'. The essential first step as a base for research and experiments was the moon, said Mr Rogozin, who is in overall charge of Russia's space and defence industries, and was recently targeted for sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. 'The moon is not an intermediate point in the race,' he wrote in official daily Rossiiskaya Gazeta, conjuring an impression of a new space race with America. 'It is a separate, even a self-contained goal. 'It would hardly be rational to make some ten or 20 flights to the moon, and then wind it all up and fly to the Mars or some asteroids. 'This process has the beginning, but has no end. We are coming to the moon forever.' Russia was in the Soviet era behind many of the pioneering accomplishments in space flight, allowing them to claim an early lead in the space race. Early achievements included the first intercontinental ballistic missile, the first satellite and the first animal in space in 1957, the first human in space in 1961, the first space walk in 1965, the first unmanned moon landing in 1966 and the first space station in 1971. The U.S. soon caught up and put the first man on the surface of the moon, Neil Armstrong, in 1969.","Kremlin programme proposes Earth-monitoring observatory on the Moon .

"The young homeless man who accompanied Miley Cyrus to the MTV Video Music Awards, got a rebuke from an Oregon judge on Tuesday after he showed up 45 minutes late to a court hearing. Jesse Helt, 22, made his first court appearance since turning himself in last month on a probation violation. The aspiring model, who is free on $2500 bail, was admonished by a Polk County judge for showing up nearly an hour late and missing a first call for his name, court officials said. Scroll down for video . Jesse Helt, the young homeless man who accompanied Miley Cyrus to the MTV Video Music Awards, got a rebuke from an Oregon judge on Tuesday after showing up 45 minutes late . Helt, looking disheveled in a white t-shirt, his long, blond locks uncombed, appeared in the Dallas, Oregon courtroom . Helt looked disheveled as he appeared alongside his attorney, whose services had been paid for by Miley . The judge told Helt to 'bring a toothbrush' if he was tardy to a probation violation hearing next month that will determine whether Miley's VMA companion goes back to jail or continues on probation. Helt, looking disheveled in a white t-shirt, his long, blond locks uncombed, appeared in the Dallas, Oregon courtroom with his attorney, whose services have been paid for by Miley, Helt’s mother Linda told local media last month. The 21-year-old singer was nowhere to be seen in court, but it looks like Helt could have used her help to get to his hearing on time. Miley was spotted driving around Beverly Hills on a three-wheeled motorbike on Monday with her 14-year-old sister Noah gripping on to her from behind. Maybe Helt could have used a ride on this? Miley was spotted driving around Beverly Hills on a three-wheeled motorbike on Monday with her 14-year-old sister Noah gripping on to her from behind . The two enjoyed a spin on the gunmetal-colored Can-Am Spyder motorcycle by BRP as they rode through the streets in the posh neighborhood. According to People, the Wrecking Ball singer received the motored trike as a present for her 21st birthday last year from her father Billy Ray Cyrus. Helt was catapulted into the spotlight after he appeared on stage with Cyrus during the MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles in an effort to spread awareness about homeless youth. Standing next to a teary-eyed Cyrus, the Salem, Oregon native said he was 'accepting this award on behalf of the 1.6 million runaways and homeless youth in the United States who are starving, lost, and scared for their lives right now.' 'I know this because I am one of these people,' he said. Night to remember:   Jesse hit the headlines after he accompanied Miley Cyrus to the MTV Video Music Awards in August . Days after the award ceremony, it emerged that Helt was wanted by authorities in Oregon for violating probation after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor criminal mischief and criminal trespass charges in 2010 for breaking into the home of a man he believed was selling bad marijuana, according to court records. Helt was sentenced to 30 days in jail and was given probation but instead of fulfilling the latter half of the court penalty, he moved to Los Angeles where he lived on the streets as he tried to kick-start a career in show business. Cyrus said she melt Helt while touring the Hollywood homeless center My Friend's Place. Helt’s next court appearance is set for October 7th.

"Wearing a huge doorknocker through your nose may not be the epitome of high fashion for most of us, but this catwalk trend is now hitting the High Street. The look was first seen in Givenchy’s autumn/winter 2013  fashion show in Paris, when designer Ricardo Tisci sent both male and female models down the runway with intricately embellished, oversized nose rings. Unsurprisingly, pieces by the high-end French designer do not come cheap: a . single pale gold hoop nose ring with wing and jet crystal detail was on . sale for $595 (£388) at Barneys department store. However, you can now get the couture look at a fraction of the price as High Street brand ASOS.com has come up with a lookalike ‘spike’ nose ring - for just £5. Punk look: The Asos doorknocker septum ring costs just £5 - and doesn't require you to have your nose pierced . Not born that way: Lady Gaga had her septum pierced while in Chicago this week. She's pictured here with the man who punched the hole . The clip-on hoop is made from stainless steel and features . faceted stones either side of the central spike to give a touch of . sparkle. It's designed to hang down over the lip, like the Givenchy jewellery. Happily for the squeamish but fashion-conscious, neither the . Givenchy and Asos versions require a piercing. However, the trend for puncturing the septum appears to be gathering steam. Last week, Lady Gaga posted a video of herself having a hole punched between her nostrils, while Scarlett Johansson had hers done way back in 2006. At this year's punk-themed Costume Institute Gala, Jessica Biel and Karen Elson both wore delicate  septum hoops. The . glamorously Gothic look which so impressed on the Givenchy catwalk was . inspired by the meatpacking industry and iconic biker looks. The . striking nose jewellery was paired with oversized stud earrings by . the male models, while the women showcased elaborate, chandelier-style earrings, which reached below their shoulders. Winner by a nose: The dramatic jewellery stole the show as models walked the runway during the Givenchy Autumn/Winter 2013 show in Paris . Star power: Model Andrej Pejic wore an embellished nose ring at a charity event in New York last month (left) and actress Jessica Biel channelled her inner punk at this year's Costume Institute Gala with a temporary ring . Striking: Writer and performer Ladyfag attended the Givenchy Menswear Spring/Summer 2013 show wearing an oversized nose ring . Delicate: Givenchy's pale gold hoop nose ring with wing and jet crystal detail was on sale for $595 (£388) at Barneys . But wearing a septum ring can mean more than a simple fashion statement. The nasal piercing is traditionally . associated with South Asian countries, such as India, Pakistan, Nepal. Bengali women traditionally wear the 'nathori' piercing as a sign . of being a married woman. The . area pierced - the small gap between the dividing wall . between the nostril and the bottom of the nose - is full of nerve . endings, so the process can be extremely painful.

"Children should receive compulsory relationship lessons to prevent violence against women, Yvette Cooper has said. Speaking in the wake of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal, the Shadow Home Secretary said the lessons should be included in the curriculum to help change attitudes. She insisted a 'massive culture change' was needed to stop sexual abuse victims from receiving blame. Yvette Cooper insisted a 'massive culture change' was needed to stop sexual abuse victims receiving blame . She also accused the Government of refusing to carry out work in schools to change the attitudes of boys. Speaking ahead of this weekend's Labour Party conference, Ms Cooper raised questions about the Home Office's commitment to an historic child sex abuse inquiry to be led by Fiona Woolf. Last month, Professor Alexis Jay's report revealed at least 1,400 children were sexually exploited in Rotherham - sparking criticism of the police, councillors and local authority officials. Professor Jay outlined details of exploitation over a 16-year period with examples of girls who were raped, trafficked, threatened with extreme violence and ignored by the statutory authorities. Speaking ahead of this weekend's Labour Party conference, Ms Cooper raised questions about the Home Office's commitment to an historic child sex abuse inquiry to be led by Fiona Woolf (pictured) In a wide-ranging interview, Ms Cooper told The House magazine: 'If you look at the Jay report and the descriptions of the attitudes of police officers and social services, there was this idea that if somehow girls were involved in sexual activity that they must have consented, that it must be their fault. 'We need a massive culture change on this. 'The reason we want mandatory reporting is also to have the law changed to kick start that culture change. 'But it's much wider, that's why it has to be about attitudes and sex and relationship education going right the way up through school.'","Yvette Cooper said a 'massive culture change' was needed to stop sexual abuse victims being blamed .

"China has taken a major step towards achieving its ambition of becoming a leading naval power after successfully landing a fighter jet on an aircraft carrier for the first time. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy landed a J-15 fighter jet - capable of carrying missiles and precision-guided bombs - on its Liaoning aircraft carrier while the ship was out at sea. The carrier, which is China's first, officially entered service two months ago, but it is not expected to carry a full complement of planes or be ready for combat for some time. Landmark: The J-15 jet is seen landing on China's Liaoning aircraft carrier . China's state news agency released pictures of the fighter touching down on the Liaoning ship. The carrier is regarded as symbolic of the country's bid to become a leading Asian naval power. Xinhua said the landing exercise marked the debut outing of the domestically developed J-15, which is said to have capabilities to match those of Russia's Sukhoi Su-33 carrier-based defence fighter, as well as the U.S. F-15 fighter jet. It is able to carry anti-ship, air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles and precision-guided bombs. Naval power: China's J15 fighter jet can carry missiles and precision-guided bombs . Take-off: The carrier-borne aircraft is seen taking to the skies over the ship in China . Liaoning: Since the carrier officially entered service in September, crew members have completed more than 100 tests and training exercises . The carrier platform and J-15 capabilities met all requirements and achieved 'good compatibility', the news agency said. Since China's Liaoning ship formally entered into service on September 25, its crew members have completed over 100 training and test programs. China spent ten years refurbishing the carrier after buying the unfinished former Soviet navy ship from the Ukraine in 1998.

"Busted: Ana Gloria Garcia-Gutierrez, 53, was arrested by Pinellas County Sheriff's deputies early Saturday morning for riding a manatee in September . A Florida woman who had made headlines around the world after being photographed riding a manatee was arrested Saturday and charged with a misdemeanor under the state's protection act. Ana Gloria Garcia Gutierrez, 53, was taken into custody at the Sears store at Tyrone Square Mall in St. Petersburg where she works. Her arrest comes more than a month after she came forward to admit that she was the woman seen in pictures on the back of a manatee, or sea cow, in Fort DeSoto Park in Pinellas September 30, NBC reported. The photos were posted online October 2 and went viral. Sheriff Bob Gualtieri held a press conference a few days later asking for the public's help in identifying the woman riding the endangered animal. 'Go ride a Jet Ski,' the sheriff said at the time. 'Don't use animals.' Gutierrez called deputies later that day and allegedly admitted touching the sea mammal. She told them she was new to the area and didn't know her actions were against the law. The manatee was not hurt. Florida's Manatee Sanctuary Acts reads: 'It is unlawful for any person at any time, by any means, or in any manner intentionally or negligently to annoy, molest, harass, or disturb or attempt to molest, harass, or disturb any manatee.' The case was forwarded to the State Attorney's Office for prosecution. if convicted of the second-degree misdemeanor, Gutierrez faces up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine. She was released on $1,500 bail, according to Tampa Bay Times. Molestation: Police are on the hunt for the woman, pictured, who was snapped riding a manatee on Sunday . On September 30, Pinellas County Sheriff's deputies rushed to the beach at about 1pm after receiving reports of a woman 'riding' the animal. But when they arrived, the culprit had disappeared. However, a quick-thinking onlooker . managed to take photographs of the woman's joy ride. After the photos of a woman dressed in a black and white bikini top, red boardshorts and a white cap straddling a manatee were released by the Pinellas County Sheriff's Department, the 53-year-old Gutierrez turned herself in. She reportedly claimed that she was new in town and did not know she had done anything wrong. Florida's Manatee Sanctuary Act forbids 'activities may not, either intentionally or negligently, molest, harass, collide with, injure or harm manatees.' On the run: When Pinellas County Sheriff's deputies arrived at the scene, the woman, pictured, had disappeared . Illegal: Under Florida law, it is illegal to 'annoy, molest, harass, or disturb or attempt to molest, harass, or disturb any manatee' Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said the manatee-molestation was 'outrageous' and warned people to leave the animals alone. 'This is manatee mating season and there are a lot of manatees around but people need to just leave them alone and not molest them and certainly not try to ride them,' he said during a news conference. 'It's pretty outrageous when somebody does that.' But the sheriff's office told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel that she was not arrested because the crime did not take place in a deputy’s presence. Deputies told the paper that charges would be referred to the Florida State Attorney's Office. Manatee: A manatee, pictured, is a large, herbivorous aquatic mammal also known as a sea cow (stock photo) 'It's clear from the photographs that's what she was doing,' Gualtieri added. 'We are asking for the public's help in identifying this woman so that the deputies can place the appropriate criminal charges against her.' The unlucky sea cow wasn't believed to have been hurt in the incident.","Ana Gloria Garcia Gutierrez, 52, turned herself in last month, claiming she's new to the area and wasn't aware she did anything wrong ."
"A seaside resort’s prized Banksy has been boarded over by hotel owners, who fear vandals will strike and ruin the 8ft high artwork. The picture of a little boy drawing a giant robot was painted on the side of  The Grosvenor in Torquay, Devon, three years ago by the famous guerrilla artist. Residents had feared the hotel’s facade had been completely repainted - including the artwork - which is believed to be worth around £500,000. The Banksy piece of a little boy drawing a giant robot  has been boarded over by hotel owners, who fear vandals will strike and ruin the 8ft high artwork . But hotel owners had actually placed a board over the work which was then painted - to stop vandals striking again. General manager Rebecca Snowball said: 'The decorating team has preserved the Banksy. 'It has been boarded over and they have painted over the cover. It has been kept safely behind. 'It had already been damaged when somebody threw acid over it a while ago. But we are redecorating the whole building and they were unsure about the best thing to do about the Banksy.' The Grosvenor was made famous by TV’s The Hotel series but its ex-owner Mark Jenkins sold it to Keith Richardson. It was painted the side of The Grosvenor in Torquay, Devon, three years ago by the famous guerrilla artist. Now hotel owners have boarded over the piece amid fears it will be vandalised . Residents had feared the hotel's facade had been completely repainted - including the artwork - which is believed to be worth around £500,000 . The former owner had placed a perspex covering over the Banksy to protect it but vandals were still able to obliterate half the image last year. Vandals broke through perspex protecting the painting and doused the wall with paint stripper, and 'obliterated' the little boy. At the time Mark Jenkins, the hotel owner, said he was appalled that someone had gone out of their way to damage something which made Torquay 'a little bit special'. Two additions of a small CCTV camera and a toy soldier were made to the original image in 2010 but it is not known whether they were the work of the celebrated graffiti artist. Mr Jenkins said the mural had become a tourist attraction in itself with many visitors to the bay stopping to take a picture.","Boy drawing a giant robot was painted on side of  The Grosvenor in Torquay .

"3D reconstructions of Richard III's spine show he had a slight deformity that would have barely affected his appearance . Richard III may be the most famous hunchback in history but it appears his deformity was mightily exaggerated by Shakespeare. Scans of his skeleton show he only had a slight deformity that would have barely affected his appearance or prowess on the field of battle, say scientists. The notorious description by Shakespeare of a ‘hunchback toad’, a Machiavellian villain suffering a twisted body, a limp and withered arm, was almost certainly an attempt to blacken his reputation, claim experts. Instead, a 3D reconstruction of the king’s spine shows 65 to 85 degrees of ‘scoliosis’, or sideways bending of his spine to the right. The condition, which would have developed in his early teens, means he was very far from being a hunchback. Despite having one shoulder slightly higher than the other and a short trunk in comparison with his arms and legs, there is no evidence he walked with a limp. The ‘well balanced curve’ of his spine could have been concealed by a good tailor and custom-built armour. Unlike the hunchback depictions seen on stage and screen, his head and neck would have been straight, not tilted to one side. Dr Phil Stone, chairman of the Richard III Society, said the recovery of the king’s skeleton from beneath a Leicester car park in 2012 gave scientists an unrivalled opportunity to investigate the legend surrounding the last Plantagenet King of England. The 'well balanced curve' of Richard III's spine could have been concealed by a tailor and custom-built armour . Unlike the hunchback depictions seen on stage and screen, his head and neck would have been straight, not tilted to one side. Pictured is Antony Sher performing as Richard III in a play by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1984 . Scientists who carried out scans of the King's spine found it had a 'well balanced curve'. Pictured is a 3D reconstruction of Richard III's spine at different angles . The findings showed his deformities had been greatly exaggerated, he said. ‘Examination of Richard III’s remains show that he had a scoliosis, thus confirming that the Shakespearean description of a ‘bunch-backed toad’ is a complete fabrication - yet more proof that, while the plays are splendid dramas, they are also most certainly fiction not fact’ he said. ‘History tells us that Richard III was a great warrior. ‘Clearly, he was little inconvenienced by his spinal problem and accounts of his appearance, written when he was alive, tell that he was ‘of person and bodily shape comely enough’ and that he ‘was the most handsome man in the room after his brother, Edward IV’ he added. For the new study, published in The Lancet medical journal, researchers conducted a detailed analysis of the skeleton’s spinal column. Information from computed tomography (CT) X-ray scans and a 3D printer were used to create a plastic replica of the spine, which was photographed from 9 different directions. The images were combined to produce an interactive picture that could be made accessible on websites. King Richard III was born in 1452 in Northamptonshire . Richard was born in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne. Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king. In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate. Richard III took to the throne the following day. He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared, Rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign. In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII. It has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verified form the bones found in the Leicester car park last year. Last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite’s eggs in soil taken from Richard III’s pelvic region. The find suggests that the king’s intestines were infected with roundworm during his life. Information from computed tomography (CT) X-ray scans and a 3D printer were used to create a plastic replica of the spine shown from two different angles here . The king was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, ending the Wars of the Roses and the Plantagenet dynasty. His body was taken to Leicester by supporters of victorious Henry VII and buried in Greyfriars church, which is now the site of the council car park. Pictured are Richard III's remains . Scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine to either the left or right. In the UK, scoliosis affects 3 or 4 children out of every 1,000. It can develop at any age. A very pronounced curve in the spine was visible when the body was first uncovered. As well as the curve that was visible when the skeleton was excavated, evidence of scoliosis can be seen in many of the individual vertebrae. The type of scoliosis was identified by Leicester University as 'idiopathic adolescent onset scoliosis;. The word idiopathic means that the reason for its development is not entirely clear, although there is probably a genetic component. Researchers believe it is possible that the scoliosis would have been progressive, continuing to get worse as Richard got older. Dr Piers Mitchell, a member of the research team from the division of biological anthropology, Cambridge University, said Shakespeare’s famous description came more than 100 years after the king’s death in 1485. He said ‘Shakespeare was writing in Tudor times, wanting to please Elizabeth I with a version of history that made her look good and Richard III look bad. ‘Although the king had a spinal deformity, the play did not get the right one.’ Dr Jo Appleby, from the University of Leicester’s School of Archaeology and Ancient History, who led the research, said ‘Although the scoliosis looks dramatic, it probably did not cause a major physical deformity. ‘This is because he had a well-balanced curve. The condition would have meant that his trunk was short in comparison to the length of his limbs, and his right shoulder would have been slightly higher than the left, but this could have been disguised by custom-made armour and by having a good tailor. Richard III will be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral (pictured) after judges said it was time to give him a 'dignified burial'. The site is just streets away from the car park where his remains were found . The grave and skeletons of Richard III are shown here. Dr Jo Appleby, from the University of Leicester’s School of Archaeology and Ancient History, who led the research, said ‘Although the scoliosis looks dramatic, it probably did not cause a major physical deformity' ‘A curve of 65-85 would not have prevented Richard from being an active individual, and there is no evidence that Richard had a limp as his curve was well balanced and his leg bones were normal and symmetric.’ Previous research suggests Richard III would have been about 5ft 8in tall without his deformity, about average for a medieval man. But his condition meant he would have appeared slightly shorter. The king was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, ending the Wars of the Roses and the Plantagenet dynasty. His body was taken to Leicester by supporters of victorious Henry VII and buried in Greyfriars church, which is now the site of the council car park. It was announced earlier this week that Richard III will finally be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral after judges said it was time for the monarch to be given a 'dignified burial'. Crown was made by jewellery expert George Easton . His body was buried 600 years ago without any pomp and ceremony befitting of a king. But now the traditional funeral crown that Richard III never had, has gone on display in York. The golden headpiece was commissioned for the last king of the House of York by a leading historian who was involved in the archaeological dig that discovered Richard III’s remains beneath a car park in Leicester. Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, ending the Wars of the Roses and the Plantagenet dynasty. His body was taken to Leicester by supporters of victorious Henry VII and buried in Greyfriars church, which is now the site of the council car park. Dr John Ashdown-Hill commissioned a 15th century-style gold-plated crown in tribute to the late king with white roses and gems. The crown was made by medieval jewellery expert George Easton who was inspired to create the design from historical artefacts such as relics and illustrations relating to the contentious monarch. The historian had the idea of commissioning the crown when he was carrying the king’s remains away from the archaeological site, having been involved in searching for the lost remains of the monarch. The funeral crown is now on show at the Richard III Experience in York's Monk Bar – one of the medieval gateways to York. It will go on tour around the UK before playing a part in the king’s reburial at Leicester Cathedral.","Shakespeare described Richard III as a ‘poisonous bunch-back’d toad’

"Michael Lively, the homeless man who sparked an Ebola alert in Dallas on Sunday after going missing following possible contact with an infected patient . This is the first photo of the homeless man who sparked an Ebola alert in Dallas on Sunday after going missing following possible contact with an infected patient. Michael Lively was the first patient to ride in the ambulance that was used to carry Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan to Presbyterian Hospital, Texas. It is possible that Lively came into contact with Duncan's Ebola-infected bodily fluids during that ride. Lively, who is not showing any symptoms of the disease, had been under observation when he wandered off. He is now in the psychiatric ward of Parkland Hospital following a city-wide search by Dallas police. Police are working to obtain a court order to hold Lively at the hospital, against his will if necessary. Authorities had monitored him a day earlier before he went missing, but want to take his temperature regularly to make sure he doesn't have a fever, a possible symptom of Ebola infection. Texas public health officials say there is 'zero chance' Lively spread Ebola to anyone else - even if he became infected with it. Centers for Disease Control Director Thomas Friedan sought to reassure the public during a press conference from Atlanta. The CDC is currently monitoring 48 people in Dallas who may have come into contact with Duncan while he was contagious with the deadly disease. Losing track of Lively was just the latest mistake by authorities in Texas, who have come in for heavy criticism over their handling of the Ebola outbreak. Scroll down for video . Clean up: Members of the Cleaning Guys Haz Mat clean up company are seen as they sanitize the apartment where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was staying before being admitted to a hospital on October 5 . Precautions: Hazardous material cleaners spray disinfectant on their personal protective equipment after working in the apartment . Getting a peak: Neighbors watch as members of the Cleaning Guys Haz Mat clean up company are seen as they sanitize the apartment where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was staying before being admitted to a hospital . Contamination: Ebola is transmitted by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. Duncan was reportedly sweating profusely and vomiting when he was taken to the hospital in an ambulance that picked up Michael Lively next . Ebola can manifest in a patient any time up to 21 days after exposure. A patient is not contagious until symptoms begin to emerge. Lively is rated as 'low risk' for infection by authorities, but officials were still desperate to monitor him. At a press conference on Sunday, CDC Director Thomas Friedan declared: 'There’s no doubt that we can stop Ebola in this country.' Ebola is transmitted by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. Duncan was reportedly sweating profusely and vomiting when he was taken to the hospital. The day before he had been due to leave Liberia, Mr Duncan carried a pregnant Ebola sufferer to her home where she later died. Four days . after the Ebola diagnosis, Duncan's girlfriend revealed that his . sweat-stained sheets were still on his bed and that no one from the CDC . or health department had been by to collect his belongings. It was not until Friday that a cleaning crew finally arrived to remove the infectious items and clean the apartment. He said that of the 48 people at risk for becoming infect with Ebola, just ten are considered high-risk. Three of them are the family members that Duncan stayed with in a Dallas apartment and seven are healthcare workers who came into contact with him while he was contagious. Unlucky number: The ambulance from Dallas Fire-Rescue station 37 that carried infected patient Thomas Eric Duncan picked up at least one passenger being being fully decontaminated. That passenger, a homeless man, is now missing . Projecting calm: Dr Thomas Friedan, the director of the CDC, said health officials in Dallas are successfully containing the Ebola outbreak there . Just arrived: This pictured, obtained exclusively by MailOnline, shows Duncan minutes after he stepped off a plane in Dallas and was greeted by family members . He noted that none of the people being monitored has shown any signs of being ill. On Saturday, Texas Presbyterian Hospital announced that Duncan's health had declined and that he is now in critical condition and 'fighting for his life' against the disease. Officials initially said Duncan is not receiving any experimental drugs to fight the Ebola because officials fear his body could not handle the medication in his current unstable condition. Instead, doctors are giving him 'supportive care,' ABC News reports. However, CNN reported on Monday that he may be getting Brincidofovir, an antiviral medication developed to fight herpes that as shown promise against Ebola. Supplies of ZMapp, the miracle drug that cured two American Ebola patients and a British nurse, have run out. Drug makers are working to produce more, but the process takes months. Friedan said today that he will brief President Barack Obama on the outbreak tomorrow and that officials are considering stepping up checks at airports to help prevent infected patients from entering the country. Currently, travelers from West African nations are checked for fever and questioned about their contact with Ebola patients at their departure airports, but are not formally screened before being allowed to enter the U.S. Duncan allegedly lied to airport officials and told them he had not been in contact with anyone infected with Ebola before flying out of Monrovia, Liberia, last month. Fears: Officers hand out facemasks at Newark Liberty Airport today, where it was feared a passenger had Ebola. It later turned out he did not . Relocated: Two of Duncan's relatives who were quarantined inside the apartment are seen leaving and being moved to another, undisclosed location . Friedan stood by the screening procedures, pointing out today that 77 people have been prevented from getting on planes in West Africa thanks to the efforts of airport officials who were trained by the CDC. Despite the calm and collected image that the CDC and Texas Department of State Health Services today, doctors and public health officials have repeatedly fumbled when confronted with the virus. When Duncan first went to the hospital with a high fever on September 25, he was given antibiotics and sent home - despite revealing that he had recently been in Ebola-stricken Liberia. He was not diagnosed with the disease until his girlfriend called an ambulance on September 28. The ambulance transported at least one other person before being taken out of service. Then, after the the case of Ebola was confirmed, family members and friends who had contact with Duncan said they were left to go about their daily routines without contact from the CDC or local health officials.","Authorities found Michael Lively on Sunday and took him to a hospital .

"A chef preparing a dish made from cobra flesh died after the snake bit his hand - 20 minutes after he had severed it from its body. Peng Fan from Foshan, Guangdong province, southern China, had been preparing a special dish made from Indochinese spitting cobra, a rare delicacy. It was as he went to chuck the cobra's head in the bin that it bit him, injecting Mr Peng with its flesh-killing, neurotoxic venom. Scroll down for video . Final act of revenge: The severed head of a decapitated snake snaps in purely reflexive fury, as did the one that killed chef Peng Fan as he prepared it for diners at a restaurant in Foshan, Guangdong province, China . The snake was being diced up to be made into snake soup, which is a delicacy in Guangdong and a much sought after dish in the province's high-end restaurants. Restaurant guest Lin Sun, 44, who was in the restaurant with his wife Su at the time said: 'We were in the restaurant having a meal for my wife's birthday when suddenly there was a lot of commotion. 'We did not know what was happening but could hear screams coming from the kitchen. 'There were calls for a doctor in the restaurant but unfortunately by the time medical assistance arrived the man had already died. 'After we heard that we did not continue with our meal.' Police say Peng died before he could be given life saving anti-venom in hospital. Victims of the Indochinese spitting cobra generally asphyxiate after the neurotoxin paralyses their respiratory system. A police spokesman said: 'It is a highly unusual case but it appears to be just an accident. The man had a very severe reaction to the bite. 'There was nothing that could be done to save the man. Only the anti-venom could have helped but this was not given in time. 'He prepared the snake himself and was just unlucky. It was just a tragic accident.' Snake expert Yang Hong-chang - who has spent 40 years studying cobras - says all reptiles can function for up to an hour after losing body parts, or even their entire body. 'It is perfectly possible that the head remained alive and bit Peng's hand,' he said. 'By the time a snake has lost its head, it's effectively dead as basic body functions have ceased, but there is still some reflexive action.' 'It means snakes have the capability of biting and injecting venom even after the head has been severed.' A chef prepares to decapitate a snake: Snake expert Yang Hong-chang - who has spent 40 years studying cobras - says all reptiles can function for up to an hour after losing body parts, or even their entire body . Snappy: 'It is perfectly possible that the head remained alive and bit Peng's hand,' said Mr Yang . Effectively dead: But it can still bite and inject venom purely through reflex action, Mr Yang warned . Indochinese spitting cobras are indigenous Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Burma. Their flesh is a much sought after delicacy and the skin is used to make expensive designer goods, a trade which has no doubt contributed to their 'vulnerable' conservation status. Residents of the Guangdong province have a long history of enjoying snake meats of all sorts in local culinary dishes.

"For one unfortunate gambler, Saturday's extraordinary round of FA Cup results will be remembered for all the wrong reasons. The punter had placed a £10 accumulator bet with a bookmaker on five games, with the odds stacked so heavily against them they would have taken £1million had it been successful. But as Crystal Palace came from behind to beat Southampton,  Manchester City went down 2-0 to Middlesbrough, Tottenham slipped to a 2-1 defeat against Leicester City and Reading beat Cardiff City 2-1. Yaya Sanogo (centre) celebrates scoring as Crystal Palace beat Southampton 3-2 at St Mary's . Patrick Bamford scored as Middlesbrough beat Premier League champions Manchester City 2-0 . If Neil Lennon's Bolton had beaten Liverpool and both sides scored, the bet would have been won . Betfair tweeted a picture of the betting slip before Liverpool drew 0-0 with Bolton . The odds of all five results occurring were so high, the gambler was given odds of a 1,000,000/1. Here is how close he came: . BET: Crystal Palace to beat Southampton . RESULT: Crystal Palace 3-2 WIN . BET: Middlesbrough to beat Manchester City . RESULT: Middlesbrough 2-0 WIN . BET: Leicester City to beat Tottenham . RESULT: Leicester 2-1 WIN . BET: Reading to beat Cardiff City . RESULT: Reading 2-1 WIN . BET: Bolton to beat Liverpool, both sides to score . RESULT: 0-0 LOSS . Four out of five results had, unbelievably, come in. The only game remaining was Saturday's late kick-off at Anfield where Liverpool faced championship side Bolton. A victory for Neil Lennon's team, with both sides hitting the back of the net, was all that was required for the most astounding of bets to have landed. And the customer clearly felt their luck was in, as they rejected a £15,000 offer to cash-out before proceedings began at Anfield. Agonisingly, there was not enough magic left in the cup for Bolton to emerge victorious. The game finished 0-0, with the unfortunate gambler left stunned at would could have been won. The bookmakers, meanwhile, breathed an almighty sigh of relief. Adam Bogdan (left) denies Raheem Sterling (right) from scoring as the punter's bet was denied .

"A couple obsessed with super heroes saved their own day and organised  an unforgettable wedding on a shoestring budget after the bride-to-be lost her job in the run-up to their nuptials. Newlyweds Becky and Steve Mear had planned to tie the knot in a traditional white wedding until she was made redundant. But the thrifty couple didn't let that dampen their spirits and organised a low-cost wedding based around their geeky fascination with comic book characters - for just £5,500. Scroll down for video . Becky and Steve had a traditional white wedding for the service, then in true Superman style - transformed the reception venue into a haven for comic book characters . Becky, 23, and Steve, 25, from Derby, incorporated their love for cartoon heroes and villains into their unique wedding reception when they got married in April this year. The reception had a dress code with a difference too, as guests also got into the spirit and dressed as their super heroes, like Batman, Iron Man and Spiderman. Becky said: 'We had originally planned to have our wedding at a 4* hotel but when I lost my job we had to change everything. 'But looking back now, it was the best thing that could have happened to us because we got to do everything we wanted - and we could be as nerdy as we wanted. The clue is in the details: Becky and Dave went all out to add a superhero touch to every aspect of the wedding . 'And the hotel would have been thousands of pounds more expensive as well. 'We are both really nerdy and we wanted to show that side of our personalities in our wedding - we just didn't want it to be like every other wedding. 'At first we wanted a Batman wedding then the theme changed to superheroes. Guests were encouraged to come to the reception dressed as their favourite superheroes . Spiderman and Superman were favorite costumes for many of the males guests . Even the wedding band got in on the act - dressing up as Superman for their set . 'Steve is my very own Ironman and I will always love his geeky side.' The couple, who met four-years-ago after they were introduced by a mutual friend at a local pub, saved money by making their own decorations and buying items on eBay. A family friend even created a bespoke Batman-inspired tiered cake for the pair - and, not surprisingly the most expensive item was Becky's beautiful white wedding dress. Nothing was left to chance: The decorations for the venue were also superhero themed . Volunteer youth worker Becky said: 'We made all our decorations ourselves and just bought all the supplies off eBay and other sites. 'We planned a traditional church ceremony, then had a nerdy reception and evening do. 'We wanted to keep the ceremony traditional as that is the more serious bit so we didn't want it to be a joke. But it just made the rest of the day feel so us. 'We also asked all of our guests to dress up as superheroes or villains, and how they interpreted that was up to them.' A generous guest made a superhero-themed wedding cake for guests to enjoy at the reception .","Becky and Steve Mear re-planned wedding around their love for comic books .

"Some people melt when they see babies or small kittens. For me, it’s chairs. I find myself stroking them longingly at parties (you do get some odd looks). Whenever I pass a sofa or an armchair, I dream of flopping down with a cup of tea or sprawling across it with my shoes off. But I don’t. Instead, I march on past, gritting my teeth, as I stay standing. My name is Liz and I’ve spent the last month Mostly Standing Up. Seats on the train or bus are banned. I’ve conducted meetings and phone calls standing up. I’ve taken to typing vertically and learned to book ‘standing room only’ tickets at the theatre. I’ve even watched TV balancing on one leg. Beware the chair: Liz tried standing up more often to see if she could lose weight . The reason for all this time spent upright? WeightWatchers’ new pound-shedding plan. As well as the usual advice on diet and exercise, they now advocate you simply stand up more to lose weight. According to the company’s latest research, 67 per cent of us are off our feet, either seated or lying down, for an astonishing 20 hours a day. We watch more TV than ever, an average of four hours and two minutes a day. And yet we kid ourselves that we lead busy, active lives. Dr Stuart Biddle, Professor of Physical Activity & Health at Loughborough University, who is backing WeightWatchers’ campaign, says: ‘Even if you exercise for at least 30 minutes most days, you are still storing up health problems from being sedentary too much. The message is clear - move more and sit less!’ He has come up with a list of small changes you can make to incorporate sitting less into daily life - from using your smartphone while standing up, to placing your computer on an ironing board and even moving your bin away from your desk, forcing you to stand up to use it. Tall order: Liz tried balancing her laptop on an ironing board and books so she could stand while working . He says you should water the garden using a watering can rather than a hosepipe. If there are just a few dirty plates after dinner, stand and wash them at the sink rather than loading the dishwasher and flopping on the sofa. Convenience is the enemy of calories. And every second counts. WeightWatchers suggests you squeeze the muscles in your bottom repeatedly as you brush your teeth. 'I hate the idea that something so innocent as sitting down is actually doing irreparable damage to my health' Simply by standing and walking for five minutes in every 30 of an eight-hour working day - an hour and 20 minutes a day - Dr Biddle say an average adult could burn over 2,500 calories over one month. That’s a third of a stone. ‘Of course, more physical activity and healthy eating will also help a great deal, but small changes, like standing and moving every half hour, can be an important part of weight control,’ he adds. ‘The change will be slow and gradual. If we move more while standing, the benefits will be greater.’ A third of a stone just for standing up for a bit? I resolved to see what would happen if I stood up for three hours every day for a month. On the first day, I had to take a rush-hour train to a meeting. Standing up was tough, and I had to go against all of my commuter instincts when I spotted the perfect seat. But I clung on for 30 minutes, distracting myself with a gripping novel. Result: After a month of standing up more she lost half a stone . Mid-afternoon was another test as I wandered around an art gallery, without stopping for a coffee, followed by an hour’s window shopping and a stroll across the park to meet friends. My calves began to feel tight, my back ached (memo to self: keep your handbag light or you end up lopsided). But I found that by walking through the pain I did actually feel more energised. By the evening, I didn’t want to sit down on the train, even as a treat. Back at home, I watched an episode of House Of Cards, standing upright. It felt most peculiar, but I noticed I concentrated on the programme much more than normal. Sitting down clearly makes my brain sluggish, as well as my muscles. Frankly it was a relief to go to bed - lying down, what a hedonistic joy. Sitting targets . Women are 40 per cent more likely to die early if they sit for six hours a day than if they sit for three . The next day I got stuck into working while upright. WeightWatchers advises you to do some stretching or star jumps every half hour to kickstart your metabolism. The star jump and I will never be friends, but I did try typing an article while standing up. My desk proved too far away from my arms, so I repositioned the laptop on the ironing board, balanced on a pile of books. But I’m so damn shortsighted that I still I couldn’t see the keyboard properly and felt like Les Dawson mangling the piano. Any concentration evaporated. Disaster.While typing was difficult, making phonecalls was a winner. I focused more on the conversation and it made me feel authoritative. I did my best to remain chairless when I went in for catch-up meetings with editors, leaning against their desk rather than flopping down gratefully. And it is rather productive, with all business conducted in under ten minutes. I’m not surprised to hear that U.S. companies favour this style over long, sit-down conferences where people get too comfortable. Bottoms down: We spend too many hours a day being sedentary . As the month went on, I began carving away the time I usually spend on my generous English bottom. And I discovered that going for dinner was still possible thanks to my new love affair with restaurants where you stand up to eat at the counter, from Japanese noodle bars to espresso counters. The only pain is you eat and leave, rather than lingering for a leisurely feast with friends. Standing up can be socially awkward, too, as it does rather unnerve other people. Female friends would say: ‘For heaven’s sake sit down, Liz, it’s not comfortable to have you towering over me.’ But after a month of staying on my feet for three hours a day, I’ve lost half a stone. And, yes, I was still eating cheese and drinking wine. I’ve bought a new pair of (size 14) trousers for the first time in ten years. My legs and stomach are more toned. I get up from the sofa without making that strange ‘Oof’ noise. I feel more capable and energised. Though I know I will never be able to stand up all day, every day (I’m still working up the courage to ask for a blow-dry standing up; I’m 5ft 8in, will they ask an energetic young stylist to climb a stepladder?) I’m going to try to stay on my feet as much as possible. I hate the idea that something so innocent as sitting down is actually doing irreparable damage to my health. ‘Those who sit a lot tend to have a higher risk of lifestyle diseases, including diabetes, regardless of how much exercise you do,’ warns Dr Biddle. I do still have dreadful chair lust at parties, though. So don’t be surprised if you come across me, standing alone like a wallflower, fondling a nicely-upholstered Chippendale.","67 per cent of us are sedentary for 20 hours a day .

"Women's drinking is being increasingly cited by men when they file for divorce . It was once a familiar stereotype – the husband staying late in the pub after work, the angry wife fretting over his ruined dinner in the oven. But so-called ‘Sex and the City’ drinking, and women turning to alcohol to cope with stress, has turned the cliche on its head. A growing number of men are filing for divorce as a result of their wives’ excessive drinking, top family lawyers have said. Head of family law at Slater & Gordon, Amanda McAlister, said: ‘The traditional image of the husband spending too long at the pub, while the obedient wife tended to the children is far less common than it was only ten or fifteen years ago.’ She sees 40 to 50 divorces a year where alcohol is a contributing factor – the vast majority where women are the problem. Mrs McAlister said there has been a 70 per cent increase in men citing alcohol misuse in divorce over the past five years. She said some women are ‘Sex and the City drinkers’ who go out to see friends or network. ‘Many of the men who come to me say their wives often don’t come home until 4am,’ she added. More serious are ‘home drinkers’, with problems due to stress or depression, who drink large amounts, often in secret.In these cases, the wife tends to drink large amounts in the home, often in secret, and the husband has found hidden empty bottles of wine and vodka. She added: ‘Husbands, she says, ‘will often initially cite a different reason for divorce, such as that their wife doesn’t work or help around the house. 'It only later comes to light that the reason she’s not doing so is because she’s often drunk or nursing a hangover. 'Men are often embarrassed to discuss their wife’s behaviour, so the prevalence of these issues is only now  coming to light.’ Mrs McAlister recently dealt with the case of a businessman from Cheshire, with three children aged seven, 11 and 14. So-called Sex and the City, after the famous U.S. sitcom, and women turning to alcohol to cope with stress are turning traditional gender drinking cliches on its head . His wife started drinking when she lost her job. She became violent towards him and was arrested for GBH against him. He was granted custody of the children, but lost his job as he became their carer. Elizabeth Hicks is head of family law at Irwin Mitchell. Speaking on behalf of family law group Resolution, said: ‘Women are catching up with men in their reaction to stressful home and work lives. 'Modern society today is such that women can go out with girlfriends and drink in a way that wasn’t possible 10 years ago and some of the effects are being seen in the home. ‘More women are turning to the bottle and unfortunately when there are children involved the effects can be dire.’","More men filing for divorce as result of wives' excessive drinking .

"People could lose up to half a stone if they choose to cycle, walk or take public transport to and from work, experts have said. Scientists in London have found that people who get the bus or train and those who walk or cycle into the office weigh less than those who get to work in private vehicles. The new study, published on thebmj.com, examined more than 15,000 commuters’ body mass index (BMI) scores. The average BMI for men was 28 and the average BMI score for women was 27. Scroll down for video . A new study by a team at University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, found that people who get the bus or train, and those who walk or cycle weigh less than those who drive in private vehicles . They found that compared with using private transport, people who travelled by public or active transport, including cycling and walking had significantly lower BMI scores . According to NHS guidance, those with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 are considered to be overweight. The researchers from University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, found that compared with using private transport, people who travelled by public or active transport had significantly lower BMI scores. Men who commuted using public modes of transport or those who walked or cycled had BMI scores around one point lower than those who used private transport - equating to a difference in weight of 3kg, or almost half a stone, for the average man. Women who used public transport or actively made their way into the office had BMI scores around 0.7 points lower than those who drive themselves in to work - equating to a difference in weight of 2.5kg, or 5.5lb, for the average woman. The authors wrote: 'Those who used active and public transport modes had a lower BMI and percentage body fat compared with those who used private transport. 'A key finding from this study is that the effects observed for public transport were very similar in size and significance to those for walking or cycling to work. The authors wrote: 'A key finding from this study is that the effects observed for public transport were very similar in size and significance to those for walking or cycling to work' 'This finding may have important implications for transport and health policy, as over the past decade the proportion of commuters who walk or cycle to work has remained stubbornly low outside major cities in the UK. 'Greater emphasis on encouraging a shift from private to public transport modes may plausibly have significant population health benefit and may be more acceptable to commuters.' Doctor Ellen Flint, a research fellow at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the differences are 'larger than those seen in the majority of individually focused diet and physical activity interventions to prevent overweight and obesity'. The researchers said that although their study was large, no firm conclusions can be drawn about direct cause and effect. However, they say the use of public transport and walking and cycling in the journey to and from work 'should be considered as part of strategies to reduce the burden of obesity and related health conditions'. Dr Flint added: 'Further research is required in order to confirm the direction of causality in the association between active commuting and body weight.'","London experts found people who get the bus or train and those who cycle or walk weigh less than people who drive to work .

"Republican Rep. Vance McAllister - aka the kissing Congressman -  won't be on the ballot this fall, but that doesn't mean he won't seek elected office ever again. 'No, I wouldn’t rule it out,' McAllister told Politico on Wednesday. 'I’d just have to see what’s right for me and my family at the time. … For future politics, I don’t know what it holds, but if there’s a possibility that the people want me to do another political office, again, maybe I’ll do it.' Louisiana Republican Vance McAllister, left, says he's not quitting his job, even though he got caught cheating on his wife Kelly, right, because she doesn't want him to . Video of the Congressman and his scheduler smooching in his Louisiana Congressional office created headaches for the Congressman and the aide, Melissia Peacock, after a local news station aired their dirty laundry . McAllister, a married father of five, was infamously caught on camera kissing his scheduler, who is also married, just months after he was elected. The Louisiana businessman was swept into office in a special election to replace Rep. Rodney Alexander after the latter left vacatred his seat to go work for Loisiana Governor Bobby Jindal. Video of the two smooching in McAllister's Louisiana Congressional office created headaches for the Congressman and the aide, Melissia Peacock, after a local news station aired the Congressman's dirty laundry. McAllister said he now knows the leak came from within and the staffer responsible no longer works for him. He's not telling reporters the person's name, though. 'I don’t want to bring anyone else down,' McAllister told Monroe, Louisiana, news station KTVE/KARD this week. Local media have speculated the Congressman's Monroe district office director Leah Gordon was the culprit because she submitted her resignation amid the scandal, and McAllister's description of the leaker all but confirmed it was Gordon. Vance McAllister poses for a photo with Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson and Willie's wife Korie ahead of McAllister's ahead of the president's State of the Union address in January . Prior to his affair, McAllister's claim to fame was that he had received the endorsement of Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson. When the scandal broke, McAllister says Robertson told him to 'put politics in the back seat and take care of your family first.' 'We’re you’re friends and we still love you,' Robertson reportedly said. Fellow philandering Louisiana politician David Vitter also stuck by him when things turned south. 'We talked a couple times by phone and through text message and [his . message] was just support: like, ""Keep your head up,"" ""Thinking about . you and your family,’"" ""‘I know times are tough,"" that kind of stuff… that . this is not the end of the world,' McAllister told Politico. Other political players were not as kind. Governor Jindal, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and the Louisiana Republican Party vocally called on McAllister to resign. McAllister told KTVE/KARD that the same Louisiana politicians calling on him to quit never had his back - even before the scandal-'so that's really no big surprise and shocker.' As for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, McAllister agreed with KTVE/KARD reporter interviewing him that Cantor was 'maybe a little bit' out of line in calling for his resignation. The two talked in the wake of the scandal soon after McAllister resumed his duties and returned to Washington, D.C., McAllister said. At that meeting  Cantor again called for his resignation, but 'it was more as a friend to friend.' 'There's no ill will between me and Eric,' McAllister said . 'It is what it is, and we'll be fine, and we've got a job to do, so we'll move on from there.' Maybe one day: McAllister has no plans to run for Congress again, but says, 'I¿d never rule anything out, to be honest with you, whether it be the small of volunteer status for a community organization or national politics, who knows?' Upon returning to D.C. McAllister said he would not step down because he didn't want to leave his district unrepresented in Congress in the interim. He still stands by that decision. 'They didn't elect me to quit,' McAllister said. A major factor in his refusal to resign is that his wife told him not to, McAllister said. McAllister says his wife Kelly told him he 'wasn't a quitter' and 'that's not what the people want.' She understands the importance of his work, he said, 'And that's what it's all about.''It's not about this glitz and glamour, and showing up to this event and being in the newspaper, which Lord knows I've had my fair share of that lately,' he said. If McAllister ever did run for office again, it probably wouldn't be Congress. It would be 'something more local, or maybe statewide to be able to help Louisiana,' he said. 'I’d never . rule anything out, to be honest with you, whether it be the small of . volunteer status for a community organization or national politics, who . knows?' he added. The filing deadline for McAllister's congressional race is not until August. He could still change his mind about quitting his re-election race, too. But McAllister says a political campaign is not in the cards at this time. 'For this race, I’m not a candidate,' McAllister told Politico. 'I have to think of my family.'","Louisiana Congressman Vance McAllister recently got caught cheating on his wife with his scheduler .

"Relevant: Charles Darwin the naturalist who set out the theory of evolution . Darwinian 'survival-of-the-fittest' laws continue to shape human evolution in the modern age, research has found. Humans are subject to the forces of natural selection just like any other species, say scientists. Human customs such as marriage have not slowed the drive of natural selection - and men are evolving traits to increase their mating success, which could include such factors as good looks or even intelligence which might help them achieve success . This is because mating with more partners increases the chance of reproductive success for a man - whereas it doesn't for a woman. A popular misconception is that humans stopped evolving when they took up farming and embraced monogamy. But evidence from detailed church records of almost 6,000 Finns born between 1760 and 1849 suggests this is not so. Researchers looked at economic status, births, deaths and marriages to examine four key natural selection factors. They were survival to adulthood, mate access, mating success and fertility. They found that the Finns' natural selection opportunities were on a par with those seen in the wild. Finland has some of the best . available data for such research thanks to detailed church records of . births, deaths, marriages and wealth status which were kept for tax . purposes. Movement in the country was also very limited until the 20th century. Differences in early survival and fertility were responsible for most of the variation in fitness, even among wealthy individuals. Dr Virpi Lummaa, from the University of . Sheffield's department of animal and plant sciences, said: 'We have . shown advances have not challenged the fact that our species is still . evolving, just like all the other species ""in the wild"". Men are evolving to be more attractive: This is because mating with more partners increases the chance of reproductive success for a man - whereas it doesn't for a woman . Current: Charles Darwin made many of his great discoveries studying animals of the Galapagos Islands . 'It is a common misunderstanding that evolution took place a long time ago, and that to understand ourselves we must look back to the hunter-gatherer days of humans.' Dr Lummaa said evidence had already proved important selection had been taking place in very recent populations. She said: 'Humans continue to be affected by both natural and sexual selection. 'Although the specific pressures, the factors making some individuals able to survive better, or have better success at finding partners and produce more kids, have changed across time and differ in different populations.' The new findings are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Co-author Dr Alexandre Courtiol, from the Wissenschaftskolleg Institute for Advanced Study in Berlin, Germany, said: 'Characteristics increasing the mating success of men are likely to evolve faster than those increasing the mating success of women. 'This is because mating with more partners was shown to increase reproductive success more in men than in women. 'Surprisingly, however, selection affected wealthy and poor people in the society to the same extent.'","Characteristics changing 'mating success' of men changing faster than those that affect women .

"Lengthy ordeal: Sue Isaac recuperating in Spain after she was bitten by a spider . A mother-of-three nearly died after being bitten by a spider while sunbathing on holiday. Doctors had to operate to save Sue Isaac after the wound became infected by a rare flesh-eating bug. She feared at one point they would have to amputate her leg. Mrs Isaac, 58, was bitten on the bottom by the spider while relaxing by the pool in southern Spain. At first she thought nothing of it but within days she began to feel unwell and a bruise that developed on her thigh began to spread. She ended up in intensive care and surgeons operated to remove dead tissue from her leg. But she required months of further treatment before she could return home to Braintree, Essex. Widow Mrs Isaac had been on a six week holiday to celebrate her retirement after selling her hairdressing business. Last night she told how she was bitten at a friend's villa at Albox, in Almeria province, on the second day of her trip last July. 'I got a sarong that I'd left out overnight on a sunbed and sat on it and thought, ""Ooh that really hurt"" and I realised I'd got bitten,' she said. 'It brought tears to my eyes, it was like a bee sting but it didn't go away. I put insect repellent on it and didn't think any more about it.' But over the next week Mrs Isaac started to feel unwell and noticed that a small bruise had developed on the inside of her left thigh. 'I felt poorly all the time,' she said. 'I had a fever, no energy. I felt giddy, I thought I was going to faint. But it was very hot so I put it down to that.' Within days, the bruise had doubled in size and was surrounded by clusters of blisters. Mrs Isaac could not get out of bed. She was taken to hospital and admitted to an intensive care unit where doctors told her an infection had entered her body via the spider bite. Mrs Isaac was given antibiotics intravenously but, after eight days in hospital, her left thigh had swollen to three times its normal size and the bruise had grown to 10in. Lab tests found 14 types of bacteria in the wound, including flesh-eating Streptococcus pyogenes. Mrs Isaac was staying in a friend's villa in  Albox,Almeria (town square pictured) when she was bitten . Doctors said that because the antibiotics were not working, the flesh had begun to die and had to be removed to stop the bacteria spreading to her vital organs. Mrs Isaac feared they would have to amputate. 'I thought I was going to die, or, at best, I thought I was going to lose my leg,' she said. 'The doctor came on his rounds and said, ""Right, we've got to cut it open"".' When she asked about anaesthetic he told her she wouldn't feel it because the tissue was 'completely dead'. The operations saved Mrs Isaac's life – but her ordeal was far from over. After three weeks in hospital she was discharged and stayed at her friend's villa but had to visit a local hospital daily to have the wound dressed. Doctors had to remove more dead tissue every week for three months to stop the infection spreading and allow the healthy tissue to heal. It took a further two months for her to be well enough to return home. It meant she missed her goddaughter's wedding, the 21st birthday of one of her daughters and the 30th birthday of another. But Mrs Isaac says she is lucky to be alive. 'At one point I asked to be left alone because I wanted to be by myself to die,' she said. 'I can't believe I have got through this.'","Sue Isaac thought nothing of her bite at first but within days, felt unwell .

"A total of 1 in 10 patients cannot get a GP appointment, figures show. There were 34 million occasions last year when patients were unable to book a slot when they needed to. The Royal College of GPs claims this is up by three million compared to 2011/12 and blames a lack doctors, nurses and receptionists. Unavailable: There were 340 million occasions last year when patients were unable to book a slot when they needed to (file picture) Some surgeries are now so busy that there are queues of patients down the street waiting for an appointment - at one they have even resorted to bringing along stools from home. It is partly due to the rising population as well as increase in elderly who tend to take up more of GPs' time as they have a range of complex conditions. But senior family doctors say they are not being given enough funding from the Government to hire extra staff to meet this demand. Dr Maureen Baker, chair of the RCGP said: 'People do need to see a GP as soon as possible for right action to be taken and the right treatment to be delivered. 'And this is a worry we have: that the lack of access to GPs might be making some problems worse.' Causes: The increase in waiting times has been blamed on the rise in population as well the elderly, who tend to take up more of a GP's time . 'The unprecedented decline in funding . for healthcare in the community has brought general practice to its . knees. GPs can't keep doing more for less.' The . RCGP obtained the figures from the Department of Health's annual GP . patient survey which is carried out by one million members of the . public. In December, the Care Quality Commission watchdog said that one GP surgery in Birmingham was so busy that patients brought along stools to wait in a queue outside. And in June, Dr Clare Gerada, former head of the RCGP, said that there were queues down the street outside her own surgery in South London. Dr Peter Swinyard, chair of the Family Doctor Association and a GP in Swindon, said: 'We can't give a gold-plated service to all of our patients on a share of the resources which is dropping so significantly,"" he said. 'We have had a 25 per cent cut in resources in general practice to look after patients who are sicker, who are more complex, and who are taking more of our time and attention. Something has got to give.' But the Department of Health accused the College of 'conflating the figures' by trying to claim 34 million couldn't get an appointment. A spokesman said: 'It's complete nonsense to suggest that 34 million people won't be able to get an doctor's appointment this year. 'Misleading extrapolations of partial data have been used to generate a sensationalist headline. 'The GP Survey showed the vast majority of patients are satisfied with their GP and rated their experience of making an appointment as good.'","On 34 million occasions last year, patients were unable to book a slot .

She stabbed him to death and tried to pass the crime off as a road-rage attack . Mrs Goldsworthy, 48, said: ‘That woman has stolen my husband from me. He is besotted with her. ‘I think she deliberately targeted him and knew he was married. He denied having an affair but he has told me a lot of lies.’ Andrews, 43, was released on licence . in January after serving 14 years of a life sentence for killing her . fiancé Lee Harvey, 25, in a frenzied knife attack near Alvechurch, . Worcestershire in 1996. At a notorious press conference she had claimed he was killed in a road rage attack by a motorist who had ‘staring eyes’.

Parliament is due to vote today and . tomorrow on spending cuts, tax increases and privatisations agreed as . part of a massive bailout – the second granted to Greece – aimed at . averting the eurozone’s first debt default.

"Noor Hussein, 75, believed he had the right to discipline 66-year-old Nazar at their apartment in Brooklyn, New York, his defense said. But prosecutors claim he murdered her because she had made the mistake of cooking him a vegetarian meal made of lentils instead of goat meat. Best : Noor Hussein (centre), pictured at the New York Supreme Court, was convicted of killing his wife after she made him the wrong dinner . Wrangles: The court (pictured) heard that the hardship of going without Pakistani food in prison ought to mean Hussein is given a short sentence. He was eventually given 18 years inside . At the start of Hussein's murder trial yesterday, a court heard the victim was left a 'bloody mess'. Court papers quoted by the New York Post said: 'The defendant asked [his wife] to cook goat and [his wife] said she made something else. 'The conversation got louder and his wife disrespected defendant by cursing at defendant and saying motherf***** and that the defendant took a wooden stick and hit her with it on her arm and mouth.' Defense attorney Julie Clark said Hussein admitted beating his wife but said that in his home country, beating your wife is customary. She argued that Hussein, who met his wife in Pakistan before the couple married and moved to Brooklyn, is guilty of only manslaughter because he didn’t intend to kill her. In her opening statements at the Brooklyn Supreme Court bench trial, Clark said: 'He comes from a culture where he thinks this is appropriate conduct, where he can hit his wife. 'He culturally believed he had the right to hit his wife and discipline his wife.' However, Assistant District Attorney Sabeeha Madni said: 'This was not a man who was trying to discipline his wife.' She said neighbours would testify to the 'years of abuse' Hussein's wife suffered. Madni said that on the day of her death, Hussein attacked his wife as she lay in her bed, leaving deep lacerations on her head, arms and shoulders, and causing her brain to hemorrhage. Court papers state he beat her with a stick that the family had found in the street and used to stir their laundry in a washtub. He then tried to clean up the blood that splattered onto their bedroom wall before calling his son for help, Madni said.","Noor Hussein, 75, believed he had the right to discipline Nazar, 66 .

"Children's car seats have twice as many dangerous germs as the average toilet, a new study has revealed. Scientists at the University of Birmingham took swabs from safety seats and discovered an average of 100 potentially dangerous bacteria and fungi lurking in each square centimetre. In comparison a toilet was found to contain around half that number - with just 50 germs in the same area. The bugs included bacteria that can lead to nasty illnesses, including E. coli and Salmonella. Scientists at the University of Birmingham found more than 100 potentially dangerous bacteria and fungi lurking per square centimetre on the average child's car seat, compared to 50 different bugs in the same area on the average toilet. File picture . The survey of 2,000 motorists for Continental Tyres was supported by the team at Birmingham, who swabbed 20 cars and homes to draw their comparisons. They found that our cars contain more potentially hazardous bacterial and fungal species than anywhere in our homes. The study also revealed that almost half of us regularly drive in vehicles full of clutter with one in 10 Brits having had an accident or near miss due to the mess in their car. Mark Griffiths, safety expert at Continental Tyres said: 'Many people are driving around in vehicles which resemble a rubbish tip without realising the hazards. 'To stay safe while driving and avoid health risks drivers should regularly clean their cars inside and out. 'Clutter as well as germs can present a real hazard - for example a can or bottle rolling under a brake pedal would be very serious.' The research found that 60 per cent of motorists are totally unaware of the health risks a dirty car poses to them and their passengers. Among the bugs found on car seats was E. coli, pictured, which can cause serious food poisoning . Another harmful bug detected on the car seats tested was salmonella, which also causes food poisoning as well as typhoid fever . Around one in five motorists tidy the inside of their car just once a year, typically prompted by an imminent visit to the garage. Our car footwell was the filthiest area, with several thousand bacteria for every square centimetre. 1. Broken ice-scraper . 2. Box of tissues . 3. Torch (including broken) 4. A to Z map . 5. Old blanket . 6. Toolkit . 7. Chamois leather . 8. Chocolate bar wrappers . 9. Out of date map . 10. Old phone charger . Old take-away boxes, CD cases, used tissues, maps and broken torches make up the bulk of the junk strewn around our vehicles. Dr Anne-Marie Krachler, from the Institute of Microbiology and Infection at the University of Birmingham said: 'Cars can play host to a number of potentially harmful bacterial species. 'These germs can easily spread in cars that are not cleaned often, especially if you eat in the vehicle or leave litter and food.' Mr Griffiths, added: 'Most people wouldn’t dream of using their home as a dumping ground for rubbish as they do with their car. 'With real safety implications, it’s important car owners perform simple and regular maintenance on the inside, minimising the risks posed by both bacteria and clutter in the cabin.' However, many Brits do take a dim view of people with dirty cluttered cars, with 40 per cent of us referring to them as ‘slobs’ or ‘lazy’. It’s also bad news for singletons with a messy car as 37 per cent say they would be put off someone they had just started dating if their vehicle was full of clutter.","Scientists at University of Birmingham took swabs from 20 cars and homes .

"Nigel Farage and Nick Clegg are to go head-to-head in a live debate on Britain leaving the European Union after the Ukip leader admitted he had ‘absolutely no choice’ but to accept a challenge from the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Clegg threw down the gauntlet to Mr Farage yesterday, challenging him to a live showdown between the 'party of in' and the 'party of out'. Today Mr Farage said he was ready to debate the ‘most important issue this country has faced for hundreds of years’ but called on David Cameron and Ed Miliband to also take part. Head to head: Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg threw down the gauntlet to Ukip's Nigel Farage, challenging him to a live debate . Mr . Farage repeated his boast that Ukip could win the elections to European . Parliament in May, and hailed the prospect of a debate as proof that his . party was now setting the political agenda. He . said: 'I have spent years being told I am a nutcase so when the Deputy . Prime Minister challenged the fruitcakes to engage in a national debate, . I am delighted.' Broadcasters . are already queuing up to televise the debate in prime time, pitching . Mr Clegg against Mr Farage ahead of the vote on May 22. Appealing . to the Ukip leader yesterday, Mr Clegg said: ‘I'll tell you what I'll . do. I will challenge Nigel Farage to a public, open debate about whether . we should be in or out of the European Union. ‘He is the leader of the party of out, I am the leader of the party of in. ‘And . I think It's now time we have a proper public debate so that the public . can listen to the two sides of the argument and judge for themselves.’ Ukip . refused to give a definitive response, but suggested that Mr Farage . would refuse to go head-to-head with Mr Clegg directly unless Labour and . the Tories also took part. It led to the Lib Dems accusing Mr Farage of being a ‘chicken’ and running scared from a one-on-one showdown. But today Mr Farage softened the demand for other leaders to be included, and accepted the Deputy PM’s challenge. Ukip said it would be 'ridiculous' if David Cameron and Ed Miliband did not take part in the debate . He told LBC 97.3: ‘I nearly choked on my bacon roll when I heard Nick . Clegg he wanted to have a debate on the big European Question because . this was the guy three years ago advocating an in-out referendum who now . says there shouldn’t be a referendum but now wants a debate. So he is . all over the place. ‘I’ve thought about this overnight… I got . involved in politics because I felt on the great question of who governs . out country, our own parliament, the men and women we elect and send . there or the European Commission and the other institutions in Brussels, . that we weren’t having a proper talk about this. ‘I’ve battled . on for 20 years, I have been laughed at, ridiculed, attacked, but at no . point in the 15 that I have now been an MEP but at no point have we ever . had a full national debate about the merits or demerits of EU . membership. ‘Therefore when the Deputy Prime Minister says he . wants to go public and have a debate with me on this issue I have . absolutely no choice. ‘I’ve got to say yes because we need to . have a national debate on what I think is the most important issue this . country has faced for hundreds of years in terms of our constitution so . the answer is yes.’ But he said he had ‘one small caveat’, . adding: ‘I do really want for the Labour party in the shape of Ed . Miliband in the shape of the Prime Minister to join this debate as well. ‘So the answer is yes I’ll do it with Nick Clegg, but the other two I would like to see them there as well.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage was mocked up as a chicken in this picture posted online by Lib Dem European election candidate Giles Goodall . Yesterday . MailOnline revealed that Mr Cameron had already ruled himself out. A . Number 10 source said: 'The Prime Minister is running the country. This . is an invitation that Nick Clegg made to Nigel Farage. There is only one . party that can deliver a referendum on Europe and that is the . Conservatives.' But Mr Farage hit back: ‘Downing Street have already briefed that David Cameron is too busy running the country. ‘But actually Mr Cameron that’s what the debate is about – who is running the country, are you running it? Is the Prime Minister who goes to the House of Commons once a week, or is the EU Commissioner Viviane Reding right when she said in London last week that over 70 per cent of our laws are now made in Brussels? ‘I suspect that David Cameron does not ever want to have this debate. ‘I think the splits in the Labour party between New Labour and old Labour over the European question have been highlighted by open door immigration, which hasn’t just put lots of our youngsters out of work, it is has led to wage compression. ‘I suspect that they don’t want to have the debate so it is Nick Clegg and I head-to-head. Let’s have the debate.’ Some Lib Dem insiders fear the party could be pushed into fifth place at in May's elections to the European Parliament, behind UKIP, the Conservatives, Labour and even the Greens. Lib Dem party president Tim Farron has warned the election could see the party lose every one of its seats in the European Parliament. In 2009 the Lib Dems polled almost 14 per cent of the vote, but strategists think it could be halved to just 7 per cent in May. At the same time Ukip has its sights on coming top in the European Parliament elections, ahead of Labour and the Tories in third. The Tories have promised to hold an in-out referendum on leaving the EU by 2017, but Mr Clegg has argued it would create unnecessary uncertainty. He will use the European elections to argue that abandoning the EU would damage jobs in the UK, hamper police in fighting crime, setback the fight against climate change and undermine Britain’s standing in the world. However, senior Lib Dems fear the elections could see the party wiped out. Mr Farron told activists: ‘There is one last big test before the general election — Thursday, May 22. 'We defend more than 700 councillors, and [our] MEPs, and at stake are hundreds of campaigners who deserve to win. In several councils, we are defending our final foothold, and our very presence in the European Parliament could be at stake. ‘It's not just our party's place in Europe that is at stake, it's Britain's too. ‘We know Europe needs reform, and the best place to do that is from within. Only the Liberal Democrats are brave enough to make this argument and put British jobs and investment first.’","Lib Dem leader threw down the gauntlet to Ukip for a head-to-head debate .

The Mail reported today how Harry finally got the chance to celebrate his 30th birthday last night - two days late - at a black-tie party at Clarence House featuring singer Ellie Goulding. Miss Goulding, who performed at William and Kate's wedding reception, was said to have played an acoustic set of hits. She and Harry are firm friends, posing for photographs at the Invictus Games.

"Medical marvel: Doctors described Stephen Thorpe, 21, as 'truly a unique case' after he awoke from a coma following a multiple car crash that left him needing a machine to stay alive . They were told there was no chance of their son surviving after he suffered devastating injuries in a car crash. But Steven Thorpe’s parents refused to give up hope – despite four specialists declaring that the 17-year-old was brain dead. Convinced they saw a ‘flicker’ of life . as Steven lay in a coma, John and Janet Thorpe rejected advice to . switch off his life support machine. They begged for another opinion – and it was a decision that saved him. A neurosurgeon found faint signs of . brain activity and two weeks later, Steven woke from his coma. Within . seven weeks, he had left hospital. And four years on, the trainee accounts clerk says he owes everything to the persistence of his parents. From his home in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, Steven, 21, said: ‘I feel so lucky that my parents wouldn’t take no for an answer.’ The schoolboy was travelling in a . Rover with two friends in February 2008 when a stray horse ran into the . path of the car in front of them. His friend Matthew Jones, 18, was . killed in the accident. Steven suffered serious injuries to his face, . head and arm, and was declared brain dead two days later. He said: ‘The doctors were telling my . parents that they wanted to take me off the life support. The words they . used to my parents were “You need to start thinking about organ . donations”. ‘I think that’s what gave my dad . energy. He thought “No way”. They still believed I was there. When they . sat around the bed they had the feeling I was there and some words they . said to me I reacted to. ‘I think if my dad had agreed with them then I would have been off the life support machine in seconds.’ Accountant Mr Thorpe, 51, contacted . private GP Julia Piper, known for her work in traditional and . alternative medicines. Moved by their story, she asked a neurosurgeon . whom she knew to visit Steven at University Hospital in Coventry. Incredibly, he concluded that Steven was not brain dead and that there was still a slim chance of recovery. Doctors agreed to try to bring Steven . out of his chemically-induced coma to see if he could survive. Two weeks . later, he woke up. He said: ‘It’s very worrying to think that more than one specialist had written me off. ‘Hopefully it can help people see that . you should never give up. If you have a gut feeling about something . then follow it. My father believed I was alive and he was correct.’ Savior: Steven with Dr Julia Piper who saved his life in Leicester. She made doctors take a second look at him before making the final decision to switch his life-support machine off . Life saving: General Practice in Leicester, run by Dr Piper . Steven, who has three sisters, has . lost the use of his left arm and has undergone extensive reconstructive . surgery to his face, including having his nose rebuilt and an artificial . eye socket made. But despite his injuries, he says he considers survival as ‘a full recovery’. He said the experience was still ‘too . painful’ for his parents to talk about, and yesterday Mr Thorpe told the . Daily Mail that he would rather ‘keep it in the past’. Miracle: Steven after two operations on his face following the car crash in which another man died . Dr Piper, who has a practice in .

"The U.S. Marine Corps has quietly walked back a 2012 directive from the service's highest-ranking officer that would have rejected female recruits and officer candidates who can't perform three chin-ups as part of their physical fitness training. The reason – 55 per cent of the women attempting the test are failing. Just one per cent of men can't complete the exercise. 'Women aren’t able to make the minimum standard of three pull-ups,' Marine spokesman Capt. Eric Flanagan told reporters on Friday. The startling admission, and the military's course-correction, came after just three out of 15 females successfully graduated from the Marine Corps' enlisted infantry training course in November. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . More than half of the female Marines and Marine recruits tested during 2013 couldn't complete three pull-ups, forcing the Corps to re-evaluate its commitment to gender-neutral physical fitness standards . Gender equality: Politics has played a role in the modernization of the U.S. military, including putting females in combat roles that have always been closed to them -- a change that requires women to meet the same exacting physical standards as men . Females can serve in most Marine units -- combat eligibility will come in 2016 -- but even existing Marines could be discharged from the service if they failed the new pull-up standards in their annual fitness tests . The new rule, set to go into effect on January 1, would have changed the previous requirement – in place for more than a decade – that requires female Marines to execute a 'flexed arm hang', holding on to a pull-up bar with their elbows bent for 70 seconds. 2013 was to be a 'phase one' transitional year, according to a November 2012 directive from Marine Corps commandant Gen. James Amos, with females having a choice of which test to attempt. 'Phase two will commence on 1 January 2014,' Amos had ordered. 'Pull-ups will replace the FAH [flexed arm hang] portion of the PFT [physical fitness test] ... To pass the pull-up portion of this event, females will be required to execute at least three (3) pull-ups.' Now, with a 180-degree pivot in the . face of widespread failures, Marine commanders' early predictions that . the change was a no-brainer seem more optimistic than realistic. In November 2012, Major General Bob Butcher told KGTV-10 in San Diego that women 'are getting closer and closer to combat, and they need to be in top physical condition as well.' General James Amos, Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, ordered the tougher fitness standards for females in December 2012, but his January 1, 2014 deadline for implementation won't be met after just three women graduated from infantry training nearly a year later . 'We decided to execute because there is no reason why we shouldn’t do this,' Lt. Gen. Richard P. Mills told a reporter for the corps' website a year ago. 'Women are fully capable of accomplishing it. It's more recognition of the changing role of women, the changing capabilities and the changing demands that we place on them.' Mills said then that the Marines would initially set the bar at eight pull-ups for a perfect score, or three for the minimum passing grade, 'and then we will raise or lower that after we see how our female Marines do in the year.' They didn't do so well, according to a report from National Public Radio. As the U.S. armed forces integrate . women into combat roles, some fear putting them in harm's way without . preparing them for the rigors of active fighting. Female Marines will be eligible to participate in  combat-ready forward units in 2016. Marine officers declined to speak with NPR on the record, but conceded the pull-up requirement was being put off because it would cost them both new recruits and active Marines. Females can serve in most Marine units but, just like their male counterparts, they can be discharged from the service if they fail an annual physical fitness tests. The change was to take place in two phases, including giving females the choice through 2013 of sticking with the old standard, which required them to hold on to a bar with their elbows flexed for 70 seconds . Robert Maginnis, a retired Army . lieutenant colonel, told NPR that 'young women, in spite of all the . training and all the best intentions, are not going to be the equal of . young men in terms of upper body strength.' His new book, . 'Deadly Consequences: How Cowards are Pushing Women into Combat,' argues that Pentagon gender politics are sacrificing combat readiness on . the altar of political correctness. Other experts, female Marines among them, insist that women can meet the new standard if they spend enough time in the gym. And 45 per cent of them are making the grade. 'Females need to realize we all have to start somewhere, and we have more than enough time to prepare for this,' Corporal Ada Canizaleztejada told Marines.mil in December 2012. 'About a year ago, I was only doing two pull-ups. I began weightlifting and targeting specific muscles beneficial for doing pull-ups, and now I can do nine.' Corporal Michelle Brinn told a defense website a few weeks earlier that she reached the goal after a half-year of intense workouts. Lance Corporal Ally Beiswanger insisted that she can do eight pull-ups now, a year after being unable to complete just one . Hitting the gym: Nearly half of female Marines are meeting the new standard, but the Corps now says that's not enough -- and is scrapping it for 2014 . 'Six months ago, I couldn’t do one pull-up, my triceps were non-existent, and my biceps were about as hard as a pillow-top mattress,' Brinn confessed. But 'a month into my new workout regimen I was able to perform three proper pull-ups and have since worked my way up to 12,' she said. Lance Corporal Ally Beiswanger, who co-hosts the official 'Corps Report TV' program on YouTube, said in a November 2013 broadcast that 'last year, I could barely do one pull-up, and now I'm up to eight. 'So I'm taking advantage of the extra time to complete my goal of 12.' A Marine Corps Web page set up to help female recruits cope with the new physical fitness standard is still active, but the testing requirement now appears destined to be a historical footnote.","Just three out of 15 female recruits managed to graduate from the Marine Corps' infantry training program in November .
55 per cent of women – including active Marines – can't do three pull-ups, while just 1 per cent of men fail the exam .
The new standard was ordered by the service's commandants in late 2012 .
Now the Marines say they're scrapping the requirement for now, allowing women to pass their physical fitness tests without the new challenge .
Existing standards allow female Marines and recruits to pass muster by hanging for 70 seconds from a pull-up bar with bent elbows .

"Claiming: Linda Kozlovska, 31, pays a reported £100 . a week rent to a private landlord for her three-bedroom terraced home . in Boston, Lincolnshire . Neighbours reacted with outrage last night after an immigrant mother of ten who receives £34,000 a year in benefits demanded that the council gives her a larger home. Latvian Linda Kozlovska, 31, arrived in Britain with three of her children in 2008 and moved into a council-maintained three-bedroom house. Four years later, however, the single mother says she is unhappy living there – because she has had three more children and four others have moved over from Latvia. ‘I have ten children living here with me,’ she said. ‘I’m the only adult. I am on the council waiting list, but we’re still here. ‘They don’t have a big enough house.  I want a bigger house. I don’t like it here. When we moved in it had bed bugs.’ Her neighbours are fuming. They say up to 18 people lived in the terraced home at one point, creating mess outside. One claimed the property was, essentially, a ‘halfway house’ for Latvians when they first arrive in the country. Another neighbour, Neil Blanchard, 39, said: ‘This kind of thing is beyond belief. If they want a bigger house they should have to earn it like everybody else. ‘It is not for the taxpayer to pick up the bill for a bigger house.’ But the council appears to be supporting her, with one councillor saying he is ‘sympathetic’ to her demands. Miss Kozlovska, a self-employed . cleaner, pays only £100 in rent a week to a private landlord for the . house in Boston, Lincolnshire. The property is maintained for her by . Boston borough council. She claims working tax credits, child . tax credits and child benefits. Every week, she receives £527 in child . tax credit and working tax credit as well as £127 in child benefits. In . total, she receives £34,000 a year from the state – far more than the . average UK salary of just over £26,000 before tax. The amount is also much higher than the £9.26 per child she would receive each month if she were still living in Latvia. There, couples can claim up to £1,865 per baby, but payments dip after children reach 18 months. Home: Nearby workmen said they are frequently called to the privately-rented three bedroom house in . Boston (pictured) to fix damage caused by the children. They said they constantly slam windows and break hinges . Miss Kozlovska claimed she has ‘no . choice but to move’ from the house because her children are crammed . inside, with some having to sleep on mattresses in the  living room. ‘I came to England to live – because we are from Latvia, which is in the EU, I could just come,’  she said. Miss Kozlovska added that she was concerned the council ‘may be angry now and make me go back to Latvia’. Up keep: The backyard of the three bedroom house has cracked paving and furniture sacked outside . 'I came to England to live – because we are from Latvia, which is in the EU, I could just come' Linda Kozlovska . She lives in the house with Russandra, . 16, Liene, 13, Julian, 12, Sandija, 11, Marko, ten, Janis, eight, . Diana, seven, Rolands, four, and twins Edvard and Alan, three. The three youngest children were born in Britain and the others have joined her from Latvia over the last four years. Miss Kozlovska will not reveal how . many men fathered her children. One of her neighbours, who asked not to . be named, said: ‘There have been up to 18 people living there. ‘There have also been complaints about the rubbish which has been put outside the property. The council know about it. Plea to move: Writing on the wall of the rented home. Ms Kozlovska says she's the only adult living in the house and she doesn't like the home as when she moved in it had bed bugs . General street view: Ms Kozlovska privately rents the house and all the maintenance is carried out by the landlord. A general view of the road is pictured. The average income for a UK taxpayer in 2008 was £24,769 . ‘It is almost like it is a halfway . house for people arriving from Latvia, who then move on.’ A builder, who . asked not to be named, said: ‘I often do jobs on the house. 'I am sympathetic to her needs. I am also sympathetic to the needs of ten children. It is not ideal that they are living in overcrowded accommodation' Mike Gilbert, Boston council . ‘The kids are everywhere. There is nothing wrong with the house. There was nothing wrong with it when she moved in, anyway.’ But Mike Gilbert, the councillor in charge of housing at Boston council, said: ‘I am sympathetic to her needs. ‘I am also sympathetic to the needs of ten children. It is not ideal that they are living in overcrowded accommodation. ‘On the other hand providing . accommodation for a mother with ten children is a fairly big ask in most . areas, let alone Boston where that isn’t readily available.’","Linda Kozlovska pays £100 a week rent for her three bedroom terraced home in Boston, Lincolnshire .

"A dental expert has claimed that the effects of gum disease have been exaggerated to sell mouthwash and expensive toothbrushes. Paul Batchelor, a senior lecturer at University College London's dental public health unit, has insisted that gum disease - or periodontitis - is a normal part of ageing and bleeding when you brush does not mean your teeth will fall out. He explained that brushing regularly with a fluoride toothpaste is the best method of protecting your teeth from decay - a more serious problem. Scroll down for video . Dental expert Paul Batchelor says gum disease is a normal part of ageing and bleeding gums can be treated by brushing properly with a fluoride toothpaste . In the British Dental Journal, he argued that pricey scales and polishes offered by dentists to treat gum disease will do little if people do not look after their teeth on a regular basis. Mr Batchelor told The Times: 'It's an overstated problem. If you don't brush your teeth you will tend to get some inflammation and bleeding, but that will not have the impact that has been suggested. 'To say it will end with all your teeth falling out if you don't do something about it, that's over-egging the pudding. 'You're creating a problem and then people will buy something.' He explained only 10% of people need treatment for gum-related problems and dentists should focus on smokers and those with a poor diet. He added that people should not ignore bleeding gums because they indicate poor brushing which can then lead to tooth decay. Mr Batchelor says the problem of gum disease is 'overstated' to sell pricey products, like mouthwash and electrical toothbrushes. 'You're creating a problem and then people will buy something' But Francis Hughes, Professor of Periodontology, Kings College London, said gum disease can be treated by dental professionals to prevent long term tooth loss in more severe cases. He said: 'We are beginning to have a much better understanding of the impacts of periodontitis. 'We learn that periodontitis is not a silent disease, but has significant impacts on patients' quality of life, not just in terms of tooth loss, but also in terms of function, comfort, aesthetics and self esteem.' He added: 'It is clear that we as dental professionals can genuinely do something about the condition. 'Time and time again periodontal treatment has been shown to be highly effective in preventing long-term tooth loss and reversing many of the condition's other adverse effects.'","Dental expert Paul Batchelor says gum disease is normal part of ageing .

"The Met Office’s ‘pitiful’ forecasts were under fire last night after it was revealed it told councils in November to expect ‘drier than usual’ conditions this winter. In the worst weather prediction since Michael Fish reassured the nation in October 1987 that there was no hurricane on the way, forecasters said a large area of the country which includes the Somerset Levels – still under water after more than two months of flooding – would most likely see rainfall levels well below average. Last night, it was confirmed the UK had instead suffered the wettest winter since records began. The Met Office told councils in November to expect 'drier than usual' conditions despite it being the wettest winter on record . The three-month forecast, which a Met Office spokesman conceded was ‘experimental to some extent’, was given to councils, the Environment Agency and other contingency planners to tell them what they could expect from December to the end of this month. It was for the whole of the UK – not specific regions – but suggested only the east and south east might see average rainfall. The forecasters – using ‘cutting-edge science’ – assured councils there would be a ‘significant reduction in precipitation compared to average’ for most of the country, adding that there was only a 15 per cent chance the winter would fall into the ‘wettest category’. It will have been of little assistance to the many local authorities facing some of the most severe flooding Britain has seen in decades. Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris said the Met Office's track record is pitiful . Swathes of the country are still . underwater, the Army is still helping to pump out deluged homes and . thousands of people have nowhere to live. Last night it was confirmed that the past 90 days have seen the heaviest rainfall in more than a century. The Met Office said the UK had been drenched in 19.2in of rain since December, making it the wettest winter since records began in 1910. It had, it said, been exceptionally wet in the South West, South East, central Southern England and across Wales. MPs and environmental planners yesterday said the long-term forecast had been a ‘mistake which could have cost Britain dearly’ and questioned whether the forecasting methods were fit for purpose. Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris said: ‘The Met Office is very good at predicting the weather it can see is coming; but beyond that, its track record is pitiful. ‘Many government agencies and some government policies are dependent on these Met Office predictions and so these mistakes potentially are costing us dearly.’ Environmental planner Martin Parr said of the forecast: ‘It was a load of poppycock. I don’t know how they could have produced it and circulated it to emergency planners. There was no way that was going to be the case. ‘It was known in November there were changes in the jet stream coming through. It was speeding up, there was more oscillation, that means strong winds were going to be prevalent, and it was going to be a wet winter. An aerial shot of Moorland in the flooded Somerset Levels which according to the Met Office was going to enjoy a dry winter . Dredging is finally to restart on the Somerset Levels next month. Flood victims whose homes and farms have been under water since Christmas have laid the blame squarely at the door of the Environment Agency, which stopped regular dredging in 1995. Now, after pressure from the Prime Minister, officials will clear five-mile stretches of two rivers as soon as it is safe to do so. Floods minister Dan Rogerson said: ‘Today marks a crucial step forwards in ensuring local communities around the Somerset Levels are better protected.’ ‘These forecasts affect decisions the authorities take, having the correct .

The three-month forecasts are now sent only to contingency planners, such as councils,  government departments, and insurance companies. The 90-day forecast was issued at the end of November, and makes clear planners should also consult the forecasts released 30 and 15 days ahead which are more accurate. Using the Met Office’s super-computer, which can perform 100trillion calculations a second, experts in November predicted there would be high-pressure weather systems across Britain ‘with a slight signal for below average precipitation’.

A spokesman for the Met Office said: ‘Our short and medium-term forecasts are the ones relied on by emergency responders to help them manage the impacts of severe weather. 'The Met Office’s five-day forecasts and severe weather warnings have provided excellent guidance throughout this period of exceptionally stormy and wet weather.’ In response to this article, the Met Office points out that long-term forecasts are experimental and its five day severe weather warnings this winter proved invaluable to the public and emergency services.","Worst weather prediction since Michael Fish reassured the nation in October 1987 there was no hurricane on the way .

"Try to picture a typical American. You're going to struggle. In a collection of faces of all tints, hues, eye colours, and hair shades, renowned portrait artist Martin Schoeller has captured the nation's diversity. The headshots, set against a plain background, are labelled with the subject's 'self ID' and 'census box checked'. Melting pot: Schoeller, who has captured people such as Brad Pitt, attempted to chart America's races . Milestone: Steve McCurry's iconic photograph of an Afghanistani refugee was the 1985 cover . It is a bid to depict the 'melting pot' of races in the United States, as indicated on the 2000 and 2010 census for a souvenir edition of National Geographic. Detailed data of race was first collected by the U.S. Census Bureau just 13 years ago when the traditional form was altered. Including the option for more than one race, organisers were met with 6.8million different categories. In 2010, it rose by 32 per cent. Identity: The razor-sharp headshots are intended to capture the core of American identity, Schoeller said . Change: The collection comes just 13 years after the US Census Bureau began documenting races in detail . Now, in a special edition to mark National Geographic's 125th birthday, Schoeller has attempted to map the data with portraits. 'I just say I’m brown,' McKenzi McPherson, 9, tells author Lise Funderburg. 'And I think, Why do you want to know?' 'Certainly, race still matters in this country, despite claims that the election of Barack Obama heralded a post-racial world,' Funderburg adds. 'We may be a pluralist nation by 2060, when the Census Bureau predicts that non-Hispanic whites will no longer be the majority. 'But head counts don’t guarantee opportunity or wipe out the legacy of Japanese-American internment camps or Jim Crow laws.' Speaking to a number of different American citizens to accompany Schoeller's pictures, Funderburg found people treat their heritage in different ways. One woman of Dominican-Korean background said she likes to let people guess before she explains. Funderburg writes: 'It’s...for the rest of us, an opportunity. Future: The change in data collection could force us to reconsider our stereotypes, writes Lise Funderburg . National Geographic magazine, which launched in 1888, aims to look at issues for future generations . 'If we can’t slot people into familiar categories, perhaps we’ll be forced to reconsider existing definitions of race and identity, presumptions about who is us and who is them.' The portraits sit alongside a collection of the magazine's most famous photographs since it launched in 1888 in an issue titled 'The Power of Photography'. Steve McCurry's striking image of an Afghanistani refugee with piercing green eyes was the cover in 1985, and has been fished out again to mark the milestone. Editor-in-chief, Chris Johns, told Forbes: 'Photography is part of the DNA of National Geographic. 'People react to images on a fundamental level, and showing them something can have incredible impact. 'Our goal at the magazine is to use storytelling to shine a light on issues facing the planet and give people factual information that helps them make good decisions for today and future generations.'","The photographer attempts to document all the variations of race in America since detailed data began in 2000 .

"The father of Ibragim Todashev, who was shot by an FBI agent a week ago while being quizzed over his links to the Boston bombers, revealed the extent of his son's injuries in gruesome photographs of his dead body today. Outspoken Abdul-Baki Todashev called for an investigation and possible legal action against the agent involved at a press conference in Moscow where he showed the images of his son's body lying in a morgue with up to seven gunshot wounds, including one to the back of the head. His angry calls for justice came as a report claimed the 27-year-old native Chechen was unarmed in the clash with a federal agent in Florida on May 22. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Anger: Abdulbaki Todashev says his unarmed son was shot up to seven times including once to back of the head . Gruesome: The father showed images of his son's bullet-riddled body laying in a Florida morgue . Previous reports claimed the US citizen went for the agent with a knife while being interrogated in his home. However, a report by the Washington Post yesterday cited law enforcement officials saying he had no weapon. He allegedly did become violent when . police quizzed him over links to Tamerlan Tsarnaev and an unsolved 2011 . triple homicide but he did not have a knife as previously claimed. 'Today I want justice. I want an investigation, so that these people (the FBI) are sued under US laws,' he said. 'These are not FBI agents. These are bandits and they must appear in court.' He said he received the 16 images of his son's body from a friend in the US. Graphic: Todashev said he had been emailed 16 images of his son's corpse from a friend in Florida . Shot dead: The father called for justice in the shooting of his son who was a US citizen . Todashev is pictured lying in a Florida morgue. His father claims they show brutal injuries from up to seven bullets including one to the back of the head. 'This is not a shot that you fire when you come under attack. This is a shot you fire to execute someone,' he said. 'Couldn't they just handcuff him? At the very least, they could have wounded him in the foot or shoulder. And here he was – killed execution style.' Deceased: Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot by an FBI agent. Initial reports said he had a knife but that was not true . He added that his son must have had information they didn't want him to reveal. 'They silenced him', he added. He . now plans to journey to the US to pick up his son's body and said he . had been to the US embassy in Moscow to apply for a visa to do so. Authorities were pressuring the younger Todashev to make a full confession to the murders of  three men found in an apartment in Waltham, Mass. on the tenth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001. It is known Tamerlan Tsarnaev was close friends with one of the victims and the FBI have been looking into whether he was involved. Law enforcement sources told NBC that Todashev and Tsarnaev carried out the 2011 killings when a drug deal that turned violent. The suspects didn't want the three victims to be able to identify them, so they slit their throats, according to the network. It is that evidence which apparently led them to Todashev and his Orlando apartment not far from Universal Studios on May 22. He had questioned for some hours before he allegedly flipped and the shooting came as one agent stepped out of the room, leaving Todashev alone with one officer, the Post said.

Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, confirmed to the New York Times  on Wednesday that her older son knew Todashev. In a telephone interview from . Dagestan, Tsarnaeva said Todashev moved from Boston to Florida about two . years ago. She said she is devastated to learn that he has been killed. 'Now another boy has left this life,' she told the newspaper. 'Why are they killing these children without any . trial or investigation?' The FBI has been . investigating Todashev for the last month, questioning him several times . regarding his ties to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed by . police in a shootout following the deadly April 15 marathon bombings. Authorities said they have no reason to believe that Todashev had any involvement in the marathon bombings. Todashev . was arrested in an unrelated incident on May 4 for aggravated battery . after he left a man unconscious in the parking lot of a shopping mall. Victim: Brendan Mess was one of three victims in a triple slaying that Todashev allegedly confessed to police that he and Tsarnaev had committed in September 2011 . According to the arrest affidavit, Todashev had gotten into an altercation with a man and his son over parking space. Todashev told police that the man . 'got into his face' so he pushed him and then the man's son 'got . involved' and Todashev began fighting him. A mall security officer arrived on . scene to find the son unconscious and lying in a pool of blood on the . ground just as Todashev was pulling away in a white Mercedes. The officer chased down the Mercedes, ordered Todashev out at gunpoint and arrested him. The son was later treated at a hospital with a split upper lip, several teeth knocked out and head injuries. Friends and family members of the 2011 murder victims reacted to news of that Tsarnaev and Todashev were involved on social media. On a Facebook page dedicated to . victim Raphael Teken, someone wrote, 'Whether we ever know exactly what . happened, there is one thing we surely know and that is that Rafi . deserved a much better fate.'

"A new sex club which sparked outrage after opening in a quiet city suburb without planning permission has been ordered to close by council chiefs. The 'kinky hotel', called Club Kiss, is situated in a neighbourhood where many residents are pensioners or young families. It caused outrage when it opened in a former NHS rehabilitation centre in Southampton, Hampshire. Anger: The 'kinky hotel', called Club Kiss, caused anger when it opened in a quiet residential neighbourhood. Pictured is owner Martin Millar . The property has been reinvented by owner Martin Millar, who has installed two 'superbly equipped dungeons' and a 'kinky room'. The building, named Milton House, also features five themed 'playrooms', a 'UV room' and a 'mirror room'. But a planning committee at Southampton City Council today unanimously refused an application for retrospective planning permission. They had received a 1,000 name petition and 150 letters of objections from neighbouring residents. A planning application report said the change of use had the potential to 'cause harm to the residential amenities and character of the area.' It recommended the hotel's operations 'should cease as soon as possible'. Despite the ruling, ward councillor Warwick Payne admitted it could be months before the hotel is shut down as Mr Millar said he plans to appeal. Councillor Payne, who is also the city's leisure boss, said: 'This is a vital decision and signifies residents have won the battle and gone a long way towards winning the war. 'If the application is taken to the planning inspectorate this could rumble on for weeks if not months. Unassuming: Club his boasts a dungeon, five themed 'playrooms', a 'UV room' and a 'mirror room'. 'But I would urge Mr Millar to find an alternative use for Milton House that residents are happy with, rather than going down that route.' The venue hosted an opening event in September, called 'Couples and Singles Grand Opening Party'. Running from 9pm until 2am, the party offered guests 'the perfect night for meeting other couples and single males/females'. The new hotel has replaced the former JCT2 swingers club, which operated 20 minutes away in Calmore, Southampton. That was ordered to close after planning inspectors agreed it was being run illegally as a business from a residential property. And now Southampton City Council has vowed to 'fight tooth and nail' to make sure Club Kiss is also closed.

"Ian Birrell believes the government should introduce a tax on sugar to halt the obesity crisis . Mr Cube played a big role in my childhood. Not only did he help fund my schooling and summer holidays, but he also filled my house with all manner of sweet delights, syrupy treats and sickly treacles. For my father was an executive with Tate & Lyle, the country’s leading sugar manufacturer, whose packets were decorated with the famous cartoon cube figure. Every now and then, arriving home from his office, he would deliver the firm’s latest innovation from his briefcase for our testing. As a young boy, I devoured these sugary creations, which I imagined came from some Willy Wonka-style factory overseen by the friendly-looking Mr Cube. Back in the Sixties and early Seventies, of course, most of the rest of my diet was prepared by my mother or school dinner ladies and, like other children, I spent long hours running around parks and playing fields. In those days, fast food was a soggy cheese and tomato sandwich. Today, my son laughs when I tell him I can recall my first McDonald’s, savouring those famous burgers as if they were haute cuisine. How innocent such times seem compared with now, when most children spend hours each day staring at screens, fast-food outlets litter high streets and advertising constantly beseeches us to buy sweet treats. The result? Obesity has become a national crisis threatening to overwhelm the Health Service, which is being forced to treat ever-growing numbers of patients with weight problems and associated health problems so severe they end up in hospital. No one should be under any illusion about the scale of the gargantuan challenge this crisis presents. Just listen to Simon Stevens, the smart new chief executive of the National Health Service, who this week warned that obesity is ‘a slow-motion car crash’ that threatens to cripple an already overburdened service. He said: ‘If as a nation we keep piling on the pounds around the waistline, we’ll be piling on the pounds in terms of future taxes needed just to keep the NHS afloat.’ As politicians talk of raising taxes to further fund the NHS, and hospitals fall into debt, diabetes alone is already draining £1 in every ten spent on healthcare, and excess weight causes almost one in four deaths from heart disease. Meanwhile, fizzy drinks and sweets are causing a surge in tooth decay, with 500 children admitted to hospital each week with rotting teeth. A quarter of British adults and a fifth of children are obese - numbers which have doubled in the past 20 years . Health trusts have to splash out on super-size ambulances and £8,000 beds to cope with patients weighing up to 78st. Alarmingly, this could be just the beginning, as a tidal wave of avoidable ‘lifestyle’ diseases swamps the NHS. Shockingly, in clinical terms a quarter of British adults and a fifth of children are obese — numbers which have doubled in the past two decades. In total, two-thirds of British men and more than half the nation’s women are considered to be overweight, which presents a greater threat to public health than smoking. As a result, we have a generation of children who, because of their diet, their weight and their inactivity, could live shorter lives than their parents and grandparents — which would turn around historic trends of longer life expectancy. Britain’s obesity problems are among the worst in Europe — but this is a global concern, as is all too evident on streets from Baltimore to Beijing and Cape Town to Cairo. Forget the tired old cliches pushed by the foreign aid industry: two-thirds of the world’s overweight people are now found in poorer countries, where more people now go to bed having consumed too many calories than go to bed hungry. The question, of course, is how to turn the tide — something that defeated every one of the 188 countries studied in a recent Lancet investigation of global obesity over the past three decades. I used to think the solution was simple when I started to see more and more unsightly mountains of fat and flesh wobbling through British towns and cities: they should eat less and exercise more. And so they should — this remains the best dietary advice available. Yet blaming gluttony and slothfulness alone will not solve a problem of such severity. Public warnings from the Government and health experts have had some impact. Sales of fizzy drinks, for instance, have fallen over the past six months, while shoppers are buying fewer bags of sugar and more fresh fruit. Yet, thanks to the addition of so much sugar in processed food and drink, the amount of ‘invisible’ sugar ending up in the bellies of Britons has risen by almost a third over the past two decades. This has made doctors increasingly desperate in their calls for action. Some even argue sugar is addictive, having a similar impact on the brain’s reward circuits as drugs such as cocaine. Certainly, it’s clear many obese patients get locked into a tragic and ever-worsening spiral of depression, low self-esteem and compulsive over-eating. This is why bariatric surgery — the fitting of gastric bands — may prove ultimately to be the most cost-efficient treatment. One obese woman told me how she would binge in fast-food joints then pretend not to be hungry at home, while her soaring weight mystified her family. Her growing size made her more miserable, which led her to gorge even more on burgers, chips and fried chicken. So what is to be done? Instinctively, I recoil at nanny-state diktats, lectures from politicians (of all people) over how to live our lives, and the idea of government intervention unless absolutely necessary. But the health crisis unfolding before our eyes demands urgent action — even if it has to be forced on us through legislation. Put away the suncream and the beach towels - there’s fewer than 100 shopping days to go before Christmas. Last week, online grocer Ocado sent its first email advising customers to book their delivery slot for Christmas, Waitrose has followed suit and Sainsbury’s will do so in mid-October. Selfridges, the smart department store, opened their Xmas shop in the first week of August, while Harrods started taking ‘priority bookings’ for its Santa’s grotto only a week ago. Not to be outdone, catalogue outlet Argos last month published its predictions for the most wanted Christmas toys, with Loom Bands, foam-firing Nerf guns and a customise-your-own Monopoly set expected to sell out. And this week, ‘Christmas’ has appeared as one of the most commonly typed words or phrases on Twitter. But don’t panic, website Xmasclock.com has a ticking timer showing the days, hours, minutes and seconds until Christmas Eve, should you forget. There is a recent precedent which convinces me there is a solution: the war on smoking has shown that social habits can be changed. The imposition of hefty taxes on the cost of cigarettes, along with a smoking ban in public places, has saved thousands of lives — along with millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money that might have been wasted on treating smoking-related diseases. Smoking peaked in 1974, but since then has slumped. Last year alone, sales of manufactured cigarettes fell in this country by another 11 per cent. Now we need to do something similar to save the nation — and its health service — from drowning in a sea of fat. This means taking on the food industry and imposing significant taxes on all that lethal sugar they stuff into their wares, even those such as dried fruit, cereals and yoghurts which are promoted as healthy products. We should also enforce tobacco-style warnings on food and drink packets, as well as wide-ranging advertising restrictions. Manufacturers and retailers will howl about hitting the poor hardest with the rising prices that would probably result from such a tax, but the truth is that this is the very social group who are the biggest victims of obesity. No doubt, politicians will prevaricate, fearing they will be blamed for putting up the cost of living. Naturally, they will also calculate that the cost of political inaction to the health of the nation — not to mention the NHS — will be felt long after they have left office. But the introduction of a tax on sugar cannot wait. Ask yourself why Asda yesterday announced it was introducing a women’s size 32 in its shops, and what that says about the shape of our nation. It pains me to argue for higher taxes on anything, let alone something so interwoven into my own life. But sometimes statistics do not lie. One government agency suggested that a 20 per cent tax on soft drinks alone could cut the number of overweight Britons by 250,000. The curious thing about Tate & Lyle’s Mr Cube is that he was a very political figure, created in 1949 at a time when sugar was still rationed and Labour was threatening to nationalise the sugar industry. When the sword-wielding character first appeared, he angrily attacked state control and promoted private enterprise in speech bubbles. He symbolised a public mood seeking more freedom to enjoy the sweet things in life, even appearing in political cartoons alongside Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill. But we live in very different times today — and we need to stop seeing sugar as something benign and cuddly. With apologies to Mr Cube and all that he stood for, the state must take action to confront something that has become a modern scourge.","Ian Birrell believes tax on sugar should be introduced to halt obesity crisis .

"Usman Yasin, 30, pictured, was found guilty of hitting 81-year-old Patricia Pearson in a road rage attack after first claiming he acted in self-defence . An elderly woman was badly injured when she was hit across the face by a fellow motorist – for driving too slowly. Patricia Pearson, 81, had allegedly been driving at 5mph  when she became the victim of a road rage attack while on her way to visit her husband at a care home. Her injuries included a swollen lip, lumps on her forehead and cuts to her cheek. The other driver, Usman Yasin, 30, was warned he could face jail after being convicted of assaulting Mrs Pearson. Magistrates heard how Yasin became increasingly frustrated as he travelled behind Mrs Pearson in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, at around 2pm on June 17. He claimed that she was driving at no more than 5mph. As the two cars reached a point where the road opened up Yasin darted past Mrs Pearson and pulled in front of her, coming to a stop. She got out of her car and approached Yasin’s green Peugeot 206, leaning into the window to ask what he was doing. He unleashed a barrage of foul-mouthed abuse, Burton magistrates’ court heard. Mrs Pearson put her hand towards Yasin’s face in an attempt to make him be quiet, and he swung out an arm and hit her across the face. The confrontation happened in All Saints Road, Burton upon Trent, pictured, after Yasmin complained the elderly woman was driving too slowly . Yasin, from Burton, then got out of his car and approached the victim, only for bystander David Smith to come between the two and intervene. Frederick Powell, prosecuting, said: ‘Any remorse that he says he has shown is crocodile tears. 'Had it not been for Mr Smith getting in the way, he would have gone after her again.’ Yasin said he acted in self-defence and claimed Mrs Pearson struck the first blow. He admitted striking her with the back of his hand, but denied further accusations of assault. He said her injuries were a lot worse because of her age. Mrs Pearson, also from Burton, said that when Yasin got out of his car, he pushed her and shook her. But magistrates accepted that Mrs Pearson, who was said to have been ‘frightened’ by the attack, had become ‘confused’ in her recollection of the events. Yasin told the court: ‘I am very remorseful. She’s the same age as my grandma. If I had taken a second to think and had just driven on I wouldn’t be here today.’ The case was adjourned until October 10 for a pre-sentence report.","Usman Yasin found guilty of hitting Patricia Pearson, 81, as she drove to visit her husband at a care home ."
"Claire Biggs was battered by inmates who hated her because of her crimes against her baby boy . A crack addict mother jailed for violently beating her baby son was battered by fellow prisoners carrying out reprisals against her. Inmates at a women-only jail subjected 29-year-old Claire Biggs to a punishment beating after hurling missiles at her, a court heard. Katie Burston, 26, was among the baying mob who surrounded Miss Biggs and another unpopular prisoner as the pair cowered inside a shed being pelted with missiles. Miss Biggs had been jailed in 2009 for eight years for child cruelty after the death of her eight-week-old son who suffered broken ribs, a broken shoulder and a broken wrist. In a case that echoed the failings of the case of Baby P, the drug addict and her violent sex offender boyfriend were allowed to look after baby Rhys Biggs, even though Biggs had had her first child taken away from her because of her drug habit. Biggs was rushed to hospital bleeding from a head wound and bruises on her body after she was attacked with a metal bar in the garden of the HMP Send near Woking, Surrey. Burston of Paignton, Devon, appeared for sentence after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to assault causing actual bodily harm. Guildford Crown Court was told that Miss Biggs, now 30, from Newham, East London, was hated by other inmates because of her crimes against her eight-week-old son. Robin Sellers, prosecuting, said: 'Miss Biggs was unpopular in prison because of the nature of her conviction.' On the day of the attack, on July 31 last year she and another disliked inmate Dawn Gregory were put on a gardening project, to the fury of other prisoners. Mr Sellers said that during the course of their duties, Miss Biggs and Ms Gregory had to go to a shed - but found themselves unable to get out after coming under siege from other inmates. 'The shed was subject to impacts from stones,' he said. The last picture taken of Rhys Biggs  three days before he died. His mother subjected to him to appalling injuries, including broken ribs . Then a group of prisoners armed with gardening tools advanced on the two victims. 'Miss Biggs was attacked with a hose extension and a piece of wood,' said Mr Sellers. The court heard that Miss Biggs was taken to hospital after suffering a cut nearly five centimetres long on her forehead plus bruising to the back of her head and other parts of her body. In a victim impact statement, the injured woman said: 'My injuries took a week to heal.' Miss Biggs said she had been left feeling extremely nervous and had to be accompanied everywhere either by a friendly inmate or a prison officer. Mr Sellers said: 'Ms Burston’s plea of guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm has been put on the basis of joint enterprise.' The court was told that at the time of the attack former heroin addict Burston had been serving a jail sentence of two years and eight months after pleading guilty to robbery and attempted robbery in Exeter. She was jailed in the autumn of 2010 at Exeter Crown Court for hitting a 73-year-old disabled man, confined to a wheel chair, at his home in Exeter, and stealing his keys on August 14, 2010 - after unsuccessfully trying to rob him two days earlier. Jeremy Sharples, defending, said his client had now been released on licence from prison and was off drugs. Guildford Crown Court, where jurors heard Biggs was hated by other inmates because of the nature of her crime . He said she had a seven-year-old son and was leading an honest life - determined to put the past behind her - although she had a number of health problems. Referring to the prison attack, Mr Sharples said: 'She didn’t strike anyone with a weapon, although she accepts joint enterprise and core responsibility.' The court heard that another woman, aged 37, had received a 12-month sentence for a more serious part in the incident. But Judge Christopher Critchlow said he would spare Burston a further spell behind bars. 'You now realise that what you did was inexcusable and wrong,' he said. Judge Critchlow said that Miss Biggs had not deserved to be attacked by fellow prisoners whatever her crimes. But he said that he was impressed with Burston’s progress since she had been released from jail. Burston was sentenced to 10 months jail, suspended for two years. She was also ordered to do 100 hours unpaid work and instructed to undergo 12 months supervision from the probation service.","Claire Biggs had missiles hurled at her by inmates .

"Benefit reforms are ‘morally right’ David Cameron declared last night as he dismissed the complaints of Britain’s leading Catholic about welfare cuts as ‘deeply’ wrong. The Prime Minister said it is ‘simply not true’ to claim, as Archbishop Vincent Nichols has, that cuts have removed the traditional safety net for benefits claimants. Mr Cameron said the Government’s reforms are giving claimants ‘new hope and responsibility’ and insisted it was ‘right both economically – and morally – to change’ Labour’s bloated system of state handouts. David Cameron hit back at criticism from Archbishop Vincent Nichols about the government's welfare reforms . The Prime Minister argued that encouraging people to work, rather than rely on welfare, is a ‘social and moral mission in politics today’. Allies of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith went further, labelling the leader of Catholics in England and Wales ‘ill-informed’ and ‘out of touch’ for denouncing changes designed to make work pay. Another official branded Archbishop Nichols ‘barmy’ after he renewed his attack on the Coalition yesterday. The Most Rev Vincent Nichols complained last week that the ‘safety net’ has been removed as a result of the Coalition’s welfare savings. Yesterday, in an interview with Radio 4’s Today Programme, Archbishop Nichols said: ‘There are many cases where people are left without benefits. ‘The voices that I hear express anger and despair.  Something is going seriously wrong when, in a country as affluent as ours, there are people left in that destitute situation and depend solely on the hand-outs of the charity of food banks.’ Archbishop Nichols rejected claims that Mr Duncan Smith’s reforms – which include capping the amount families can claim at £26,000 a year – have a ‘moral purpose’. He said: ‘For some it is certainly not working out that way.’ Allies of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith branded the Archbishop 'out of touch' The Archbishop then quoted the case of a man on Jobseeker’s Allowance. ‘It’s quite heart-breaking the way that some of the people are treated, expected to apply for six jobs per week online in order to keep their benefits,’ he said. A senior Government source branded the prelate ‘barmy’ for complaining about the new requirements for Jobseekers Allowance. ‘The clue is in the title. It’s Jobseeker’s allowance.’ In an article for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Cameron defended Archbishop Nichols’ right to denounce government policy since ‘many of the great political questions of our time are also moral questions ‘. But he added: ‘I respect his view but I also disagree with it deeply.’ Mr Cameron pointed out that Jobseeker’s Allowance has gone up by £6.25 a week since the election. He wrote: ‘Let’s get the facts straight. Archbishop Nichols’ claims that the basic safety net no longer exists are simply not true. ‘Our long-term economic plan for Britain is not just about doing what we can afford, it is also about doing what is right. ‘For me the moral case for welfare reform is every bit as important as making the numbers add up: building a country where people aren’t trapped in a cycle of dependency. ‘Our welfare reforms are about giving new purpose, new opportunity, new hope - and yes, new responsibility to people who had previously been written off.’ The Prime Minister said Labour’s welfare system paid people ‘astonishing sums’ in Housing benefit and left thousands ‘forgotten about’ on Incapacity Benefit. ‘None of these things is defensible. And it is right both economically – and morally – to change them. ‘Whatever your religious or spiritual perspective, I believe very firmly that it is wrong to penalise those who work hard and do the right thing while rewarding those who can work but don’t.’ He concludes: ‘Seeing these reforms through is at the heart of our long-term economic plan – and it is at the heart too of our social and moral mission in politics today.’ A source close to Mr Duncan Smith, said: ‘The Archbishop is entitled to his own opinion, but his comments appear remarkably ill informed. ‘For a start to say that the ‘safety net’ of the welfare state has been eroded when we are currently spending £200bn on benefits every year it seems incredibly out of touch.’ The source added: ‘I would think that as a churchman the Archbishop would be supportive of the work Iain’s doing - transforming the bloated and broken welfare system we inherited from the last government - and reforming it in order to improve peoples’ life chances.","Archbishop complained welfare safety net had been removed by Coalition .

"Dressed in a sweat top, skinny jeans and pumps, it’s the perfect casual look for a night at the cinema. This, however, was Cressida Bonas dressed for a date at the Kensington Odeon with her former boyfriend, Prince Harry. The sight of the pair furtively slipping out of the pictures after a mid-week date led to fevered speculation yesterday that their romance may be blossoming again. Scroll down for video . Casual: Cressida goes her own way after leaving the cinema with Harry . Close: Cressida Bonas and Prince Harry  at Wembley Arena for a charity event in March . Observers have noted in recent weeks that Cressida has been dressing more provocatively in a series of flesh-baring outfits, just as Kate glammed up her look during her brief split from Prince William. It is the second time the couple, who dated for two years before suddenly splitting back in April, have been seen in public together over the last few days. On Sunday night the 25-year-old budding actress was a guest at a concert in London to mark the end of the prince’s remarkable Invictus Games for injured service personnel. There are also reports they have been seen together in a West London bar. Super cool: In July (left) on her way to performing 'Theres a Monster in the Lake' and arriving at the wedding of Arabella Llewellyn and Thomas Burwella (right) in a backless dress . The couple were accompanied by a group of friends on their visit to the cinema (where Princess Diana often used to take her two sons) on Tuesday. It’s just a short hop from Harry’s bachelor pad at Kensington Palace. And their viewing matter – Sex Tape, which sees Cameron Diaz’s character try to spice up her love life with a raunchy home video – wasn’t exactly the stuff of hearts and flowers. But the fact that they felt comfortable enough to go out in public together again suggests their relationship is getting back on track. Friends say they are taking things ‘slow and steadily’ – very steadily as far as Cressida is concerned. One member of her circle told the Mail that until recently the former dance student was still in two minds as to whether she had done the right thing in splitting up from the prince. She went backless at the Art Antiques London Gala on June 10 and wore short denim shorts at Glastonbury . ‘She was clearly very much in love with him but the issues that drove a wedge between them – Harry’s commitment and the pressure that going out with a prince brings – were still clearly there,’ the source said. Contrary to reports, Cressida was not present at Harry’s black-tie 30th birthday bash at Clarence House on Wednesday night. Instead she joined friends at the relaunch of a club in Belgravia, dressed in typically funky attire of black shorts and canvas pumps. When the couple realised they had been spotted by photographers as they came out of the cinema, Harry and his ex quickly went their separate ways, with the prince jumping into his waiting Range Rover along with his bodyguards and Cressida hailing a taxi further down the road. On Sunday the couple also deliberately didn’t speak, even though they were yards from each other in the VIP area of the Olympic Park for Harry’s concert, and Cressida had raced back from a friend’s wedding in Italy to be there. The 25-year-old wore a stunning blue dress at Annabels Club in May (left) and a black dress with a daring thigh split while walking in Mayfair . In fact the blonde stuck like glue to her best friend, Princess Eugenie – widely believed to have introduced the couple – who was openly kissing and cuddling her own boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank. The dilemma for Cressida, says one who knows her well, is simple: Can she dovetail her fondness for the fourth in line to the throne with her desire to seek a career on the stage? Having recently starred in a well-received play, There’s A Monster In The Lake, posed for Vanity Fair’s Best Dressed List and snagged a bit part in a new film with model Cara Delevingne, Cressida’s career is going from strength to strength. ‘All this not only made her feel good about herself but made her stock rise,’ says a family friend. Harry is said to have always been ‘madly keen’ on Cressida. According to sources, she was never far from his mind and he has deluged the blonde with calls and texts. One friend continued: ‘The really interesting story here is how Harry has changed since he has known Cressie. He was a liability, but is now one of the Royal Family’s most successful ambassadors. ‘I am certain Cressida is at least partly responsible for the metamorphosis. She is a very good influence on his life.’","Prince Harry was spotted on a date with former girlfriend Cressida Bonas .

"They were his 'three little princesses.' These are the chilling pictures of murdered nine-year-old Aliahna Lemmon that her 'killer' posted on Facebook one month before he allegedly bashed her in the head with a brick, hacked her to pieces with a handsaw and kept her head in his freezer. Suspect Michael Plumadore posted a photo of Alaihna standing alongside her sisters - one he was able to take because he had gained the trust of the family after befriending her grandfather James Lemmon. Lemmon and Pulmadore pair knew each because they were both sex offenders and were in jail together. On his Facebook page, Plumadore has several chilling pictures of the disabled girl who captured national attention when she went missing from a trailer park in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Thursday night. Chilling: Michael Plumadore, who allegedly murdered and dismembered 9-year-old Aliahna Lemmon (far right), posted this photo of her and her two sisters on Facebook with the words 'Three Little Princesses' Why did he do it? Plumadore, 39,  (seen in his Facebook profile photo, left, and his arrest mug shot, right) was a close family friend who Aliahna's mother trusted to look after her three daughters at his mobile home . She and her two sisters were staying with Plumadore, 39, at his trailer while her mother recovered from the flu. Richard . Patee, 58, whose trailer is next to where Plumadore was living, said he . didn't think it was odd that Aliahna's mother had him watching the . girls for an extended period. 'They . had known each other for somewhere of three to four years, I know that, . and he took care of their grandfather,' Patee said. 'I didn't see any . reason to question it at all.' Shumaker . said it wasn't unusual for Plumadore to watch Souders' children 'because the kids liked him.' Souders and Aliahna were listed among . nearly 600 friends on a Facebook page listed under Plumadore's name that . said he was ""Self Employed and Loving It!"", and enjoyed fantasy novels. The day after Christmas, Plumadore . calmly admitted to detectives that he had committed an unimaginably . horrific crime: Brutally killing young Aliahna and then dismembering her . body so he could dispose of it. He led detectives to a dumpster at a nearby business where they found pieces of her torso, arms and legs that had been cut up with a hack saw and stuffed into garbage bags. In his freezer, an even more grizzly find -- little Aliahna's head, hands and feet. 'It’s disturbing... This is one of those things that you will never forget,' Sheriff Kenny Fries told the Mail Online. In 30 years of law enforcement, he said, he has never seen anything like what happened to Aliahna. And he hopes he never does again. Plumador's Facebook photos reveal that he spent time with the girls at a riverside park in Fort Wayne and was at their home, as well. One especially horrifying picture was of the three girls leaning against a railing labeled simply 'Three Princesses,' which was uploaded in late November. All of the pictures were in an online album called 'The kids.' Trusted: Plumadore met the girls after he moved in with their grandfather, who died this month. He was still living at the grandfather's trailer when he was arrested . Sheriff Fries said detectives have a good idea why he killed Aliahna, but the lawman would not discuss Plumador's motive. Plumadore cracked during his third interview with police. Detectives had spoken with him twice before  and he had given no indication that he was responsible for Aliahna's disappearance, sheriff Fries said. The bogus story he first gave to detectives was that he had seen the girl sleeping in his chair at 6am Thursday when he got up to buy a cigar at a nearby convenience store. He was awakened  realized she was gone when Aliahna's mother called him at 10am, he claimed. He told police he thought that she had left with her mother so she wasn't reported missing until almost 9pm Thursday. Disabled: Aliahna was hard of hearing and had vision problems. She was suffered from ADHD and had emotional trouble, her family said. Sheriff Fries said he and his detectives didn't believe his story but they had nothing but his word to go on. Until Monday. The day after Christmas, detectives 'finally hit the right chords' and Plumadore came clean. He said used a brick to beat Aliahna in the back of the head multiple times as she stood on the steps outside his trailer. He then wrapped her body in several garbage bags and put it her his freezer, according to court documents. Despite the confession, the little girl's grandmother, Amber Story, stood by Plumadore. 'I don't care what anybody says. Mike did nothing to her. He loves those girls,' she told the News-Sentinel. Online: Michael Plumadore's Facebook page has several photos of little Aliahna that are viewable by the public . On Monday, FBI agents descended on the rundown mobile home park in Fort Wayne where Aliahna lived. The park is a known haven for . registered sex offenders, though Plumadore isn't on Indiana's registered . sex offenders list. He has a criminal record in Florida and North . Carolina that includes convictions for trespassing and assault. More than 100 emergency workers . searched Saturday for Aliahna around the mobile home park, where she was . last seen. Sheriff's deputies, police officers . and firefighters fanned out in the area around the trailer park where . she disappeared, searching on ATVs and on foot. An airplane circled the . area. But Sheriff Ken Fries called off the hunt for Sunday, Christmas Day, and ordered only limited searches of area ponds on Monday. 'Family friend': Mike Plumadore, 39, was interviewed by police and taken into custody at 9pm Monday and charged with murder . Frightening: According to a state website, 15 registered sex offenders live at the mobile home park that numbers about two dozen homes . Sheriff Fries told the Mail Online . searchers exhausted every possible hiding place in a one-mile radius . around the trailer where she disappeared. 'I had dead-bolted the door. When I got back, all the girls was [sic] here.' Mike Plumadore said he left Aliahna and her sisters in his mobile home Friday morning to buy a cigar . He didn't see any good in using the . manpower to lead further widespread hunts for the girl, who was feared . dead as federal authorities took over. About a half-dozen officers in black . windbreakers, several of whom identified themselves as FBI agents . subsequently arrived, some with search dogs were seen at a nearby . storage facility. Agents at the scene wouldn't say why . the FBI was involved. An agency spokesman did not immediately return . phone calls and e-mails seeking comment. According to a state website, 15 registered sex offenders live at the mobile home park that numbers about two dozen homes. 'Children don't just walk away during Christmastime,' Aliahna's step-grandfather, David Story, said Monday afternoon. Remembrance: Hailey Norris, eight, (centre), stands with her lit candle on Monday night during a candlelight vigil for then-missing Aliahna . Loss: Megan Lehman (centre) stands amongst a crowd of over 50 people who gathered on Monday night . Prayers: Janice Cook holds her lit candle at the ceremony . Aliahna's mother, Tarah Souders, 28, . told The Journal Gazette earlier on Monday that her daughter had vision . and hearing problems and suffered from attention deficit disorder and . emotional problems. She also has a history of sleepwalking, family members said. Aliahna and her sisters were staying at a family . friend's nearby home because their mother had been sick with the flu and . Aliahna's stepfather works at night and sleeps during the day.

"Figure skating legend Brian Boitano has opened up about his decision to come out as gay ahead of the Sochi Olympics - as Today show host Matt Lauer told him he wasn't that surprised. The 1988 Olympic gold medalist spoke out two weeks after his announcement, which was sparked by his inclusion in the . presidential delegation to Sochi, where Russia's anti-gay laws will be in effect. 'When the president announced the . delegation and I read in the news what his message was - of tolerance - I . thought I had to take this opportunity,' he said on Thursday morning. 'I’ve always wanted to represent my country as best I could, and I knew that I had to go past my comfort zone and reveal a private side of my life that I’ve never done before because I felt that the message is so strong.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Olympic gold medal winner Brian Boitano said he felt compelled to come out as gay when included in the U.S. delegation for the Sochi Olympics . Interview: Today show Matt Lauer host told Boitano that he wasn't that surprised to hear Boitano was hay . But he added that he feels the delegation - which includes two other openly gay athletes - needs to be cautious about how they present their message in Russia. 'I think we have to be careful when we go over there,' he said. 'The message is already being made by the delegation... I think that speaks volumes.' Matt Lauer, who was interviewing Boitano, commended the decision, adding: 'Please don't take this the wrong way but I wasn't shocked.' Smiling, Boitano responded: 'I never thought that I . would be coming out in this way, and in a matter of 10 hours, I decided . to do it. Watch the full interview at Today . Private life: Brian Boitano, seen on the ice in 1994, publicly came out as gay in last month . 'That was what was . right for me at this time, so I tell everybody that I think that they . should do what’s right for them at their correct time.' He added: 'I've . always been a private person. I've never been ashamed of who I was. I . intend to be a private man, just now a private gay man.' In addition to his gold medal from the . Calgary Olympics in 1988, Boitano also came in sixth place in the 1994 . games and is a two time World Champion. He . came out last week, writing: ‘I am many things: a son, a brother and . uncle, an athlete, a cook, an author and being gay is just one part of . who I am. Then and now: Boitano's career high was the gold medal win in 1988 (left) but also won two World Championships and a sixth place distinction in the 1994 games . ‘First and foremost I am an American . athlete and I am proud to live in a country that encourages diversity, . openness and tolerance. I hope we can remain focused on the Olympic . spirit which celebrates achievement in sport by peoples of all nations.’ He . had never addressed his personal life before the announcement, but said . he felt compelled to do so in light of the Sochi Games. ‘It . has been my experience from competing around the world and in Russia . that Olympic athletes can come together in friendship, peace and mutual . respect regardless of their individual country’s practices,’ he wrote. Boitano will be one of three openly . gay athletes who will be traveling to Russia as part of the delegation, . which President Obama is sending in his place as neither he nor Michelle . or Vice President Joe Biden will be attending. Biggest name: Billie Jean King, who President Obama awarded the Medal of Freedom in 2009, will be a part of the team to Sochi and attending the opening ceremonies . This is the first time since 2000 that . the U.S. will not send a president, former president, first lady or . vice president to the Games. The White House said Obama's schedule will not permit him to attend the Games. France and Germany are among the other countries who will not send their presidents to Sochi for the Games. The other two open . athletes who are part of the American delegation are tennis star Billie . Jean King, who Obama awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009, . and hockey player Caitlin Cahow. Ms . King, who said she was ‘deeply honored’ to be included, will be . attending the opening ceremonies while Ms Cahow will attend the closing . ceremony. Open: Hockey player Caitlin Cahow is also a lesbian and will be attending the Sochi games . 'I am equally proud to stand with the members of the LGBT community in support of all athletes who will be competing in Sochi and I hope these Olympic Games will indeed be a watershed moment for the universal acceptance of all people,' said King. Russia has come under fierce criticism for passing national laws banning 'gay propaganda.' Though the White House did not specifically address the Russian laws in making its announcement, spokesman Shin Inouye said the delegation 'represents the diversity that is the United States' and that Obama 'knows they will showcase to the world the best of America - diversity, determination and teamwork.' Earlier this fall, skier Bode Miller was one of the few American athletes to speak out against the Russian law, calling it 'absolutely embarrassing'.","Brian Boitano, who won a gold medal in 1988, had never publicly addressed his sexuality before his announcement last month .

"It may be the busiest night of the year for fun-lovers - but Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson was safely tucked up in bed on New Years Eve - at least according to his son Willie. Speaking for the first time since his father's anti-gay and racially offensive comments to GQ magazine, Willie, who is the business brains behind the $400 million Duck Dynasty empire, revealed that his controversial father prefers to give Holiday Season partying a miss. Explaining that New Year's Eve isn't a big deal to his dad, Willie said that he was in bed and his wife Korie added that if he was watching anything it would be Fox News. Scroll down to watch... Clean slate: Willie Robertson and his wife Korie appeared on Fox News on New Years Eve to see in 2014 and to put 2013 behind them . Speaking from Colorado, where they are skiing, Willie and his wife steered well clear of any further contentious issues which could cause the recent furore over his father's comments to flare up again. Asked about his father's suspension and subsequent reinstatment by A&E for quoting Biblical passages which compared homosexuality to bestiality, Willie Roberston said that 'A&E and us are fine.' 'We are just glad to be back at work and ready to break in a new year and start making fun shows . 'We are ready to move on and we have all learned a lot.' Indeed, the Robertson family and A&E - which is owned by Disney and the Heast Corporation - have created a merchandising empire worth hundreds of millions since the shows launch in 2012. Asked what 2014 held for the Roberston's, Willie said that the family and their patriarch are looking forward to 'more of the same' and will 'stick together.' During their second exclusive interview with hosts Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Bill Hemmer following the ball drop at Times Square, Willie and Korie Robertson were teased about their first kiss of 2014. As the couple indulged the Fox host, country star Luke Bryan photo-bombed the shot and tried to lean in and give Willie Robertson a kiss. 'Let me get a kiss!' Bryan said, grabbing Robertson’s face, but failing to land a smooch. Speaking further about the future of Duck Dynasty, Korie said, 'We’ve been so blessed in 2013 that you know, I think I just hope it continues. We’re going to stick together as a family, and doing what we’re doing, and giving God the glory.' For his part, Willie said, 'Hopefully my employees will keep up with more duck calls while I’m way. Nobody has been putting together duck calls since I’ve been gone. I have to get back and crack the whip.' The son of Phil Robertson concluded by promising, 'I’m going take better care of my beard this year than last year. More lotions and oils. I need to get back to the beard.' New years kiss: Willie and Korie Robertson leaned in for a quick kiss while they appeared on Fox News while the vacationed in Colorado on a skiing holiday . Interruption: Country singer Luke Bryan photo-bombed the shot, and leaned over Korie Robertson to give Willie a near-miss kiss . The Robertson clan are worth an estimated $15 million based of the back of the Duck Commander that Phil launched back in the 1970's . Just last week on the reinstatement of his father to A&E's Duck Dynasty, Willie Robertson took to Twitter to attempt to explain away the family patriarch's coarse views. 'Describing his dad as 'Ole Phil', Willie said that he 'may be a little crude but his heart is good. He's the Real Deal!' And in an exclusive statement to FoxNews on Friday, the family said they were 'excited to keep making a quality TV show for our dedicated fans, who have showed us wonderful support. We will continue to represent our faith and values in a positive way through Duck Dynasty and our many projects that we are currently working on.' 'The outpouring of support and prayers has encouraged and emboldened us greatly,' the family added. The network said in a statement last week that they planned to reinstate Phil on the reality show after discussions with the Robertson family and consultations with 'numerous advocacy groups'. Robertson was put on indefinite hiatus two weeks ago by A&E in response to the uproar following the GQ magazine interview. But despite consulting advocacy groups, many spoke out against Phil's reinstatement - the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Discrimination (GLAAD) issuing a statement yesterday to Fox News saying it the network is just greedy to capitalize off the hit show. Reinstated: Phil Robertson won't miss a day of filming after his brief hiatus was reversed by A&E . 'Phil Robertson should look African American and gay people in the eyes and hear about the hurtful impact of praising Jim Crow laws and comparing gay people to terrorists. If dialogue with Phil is not part of next steps then A+E has chosen profits over African American and gay people – especially its employees and viewers,' the said. The fourth season is set to premiere this January, and was largely completed before Phil made the statements, meaning he didn't miss a single episode of filming during the ban. The removal of the 67-year-old patriarch from the show was lauded by gay rights organizations, but fans of the show denounced it as a violation of Robertson's right to free speech. Conservative supporters include Sarah Palin, who wrote in a Facebook post: 'Free speech is an endangered species. Those intolerants’ hatin’ and taking on the Duck Dynasty patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us.' Stardom: Two of the unlikely reality TV stars of Duck Dynasty, brothers Silas 'Uncle Si' Robertson (left) and Phil Robertson . A&E initially took action after Robertson's comments caused uproar, saying his views were 'disappointing' and that A&E has always been 'strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.' Now, the network says the family has made it clear that they are sorry if they caused any offense with the patriarch's remarks. 'While Phil’s comments made in the interview reflect his personal views based on his own beliefs, and his own personal journey, he and his family have publicly stated they regret the “coarse language” he used and the mis-interpretation of his core beliefs based only on the article. 'He also made it clear he would 'never incite or encourage hate'. We at A+E Networks expressed our disappointment with his statements in the article, and reiterate that they are not views we hold,' read the statement. The homophobic comments from the born-again Christian included such insights as, ' 'It seems like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man’s anus. 'That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.' Strong marriage: Miss Kay and Phil Robertson have been married for 47-years and began dating when she was 14 and he was 18 - they married when he was 20 . Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the ""Duck Dynasty"" TV series, center, leaves the White's Ferry Road Church of Christ in West Monroe, La. on Sunday, Dec. 22, 2013. Robertson was suspended in early December for homophobic comments . He also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists, saying, 'We never, ever judge someone on who’s going to heaven, hell. That’s the Almighty’s job. We just love 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether they’re homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, you see what I’m saying?' GLAAD hit back soon after the interview was released online, calling him a ‘stain’ on the network A&E which airs the show. GLAAD spokesperson Wilson Cruz told E! News: 'Phil and his family claim to be Christian, but Phil's lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true Christians believe. 'He clearly knows nothing about gay people or the majority of Louisianans - and Americans - who support legal recognition for loving and committed gay and lesbian couples. 'Phil's decision to push vile and extreme stereotypes is a stain on A&E and his sponsors who now need to reexamine their ties to someone with such public disdain for LGBT people and families.' In addition to his anti-gay rhetoric, the duck hunter also made dubious remarks regarding Louisiana before the Civil Rights Movement. 'I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash. We're going across the field,' said Robertson. 'They're singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, 'I tell you what: These doggone white people'—not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.'","Phil Robertson's son, Willie, appeared on Fox News' New Year's Eve coverage to see in 2014 .

"It has survived devastating fire, earthquake and swinging spending cuts during its 140 year history. But now it looks as if America's oldest aquarium will have to shut its doors to the public once and for all. The small, 10,000-square-foot National Aquarium - which has recently undergone a five-year, $2million renovation - will close unless a wealthy donor can come to the rescue. Closing time: The National Aquarium, in Washington, DC, which is home to more than 1,500 animals, will close its doors to the public for good today . Sinking ship: The National Aquarium in Washington, DC, will close to the public today unless a donor is found . The aquarium, initially established in southwest Cape Cod in 1873, was handed to the Department of the Interior in the 1940s. It . has been operating out of the Commerce department's lower level since . the early-1930s. But in May, the board of directors announced . that the aquarium, which employs 43 staff, had outgrown its current building and would close on September . 30, according to news website Mother Jones. All the animals - more than 1,500 creatures including alligators, sharks, and turtles - would have to be removed by March 2014, unless a benefactor can help. Many of the animals go directly to the National Aquarium's sister facility in Baltimore's Inner Harbor. Since it was established, the aquarium has weathered a host of different . storms threatening its existence. New home: More than 1,500 animals will be moved from the National Aquarium in Washington, DC, to the state-of-the-art sister facility, pictured, in Baltimore, Maryland . In June 2004, a fire in the Herbert Hoover building disrupted 16 of the venue's 80 exhibits. In August 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake rocked DC, but luckily left the animals unscathed. In . early 1981, president Ronald Reagan proposed $31 billion in spending . cuts, including the aquarium's entire budget for that year - $289,000 it . had been guaranteed by the Carter administration. The aquarium had been seen as a huge waste of money by some in the media. National Review contributor James Kilpatrick said: 'There exists in the basement of the Commerce Department building a second-rate, no-account, downtrodden facility known as the National Aquarium.' He added: 'If the aquarium syndrome sufficiently infects the body politic, the [fiscal] mess we are in will get worse.' In early 1982, all federal funding was pulled for good. But a campaign to save the aquarium, called the Friends of the National Aquarium, only grew stronger. It lobbied Congress aggressively, demanding restoration of the budget. The aquarium was allowed to remain as a private facility, under the sponsorship of a nonprofit society whose board included the wives of Reagan cabinet officials including the secretaries of Commerce, Agriculture, and Transportation. The aquarium has hung on ever since, persisting on a shoestring budget derived from entrance fees and donations. But today the death knell finally sounded.","National Aquarium has outgrown its current building in Washington, DC .

"Israel has been accused of promoting racial segregation by introducing 'Palestinian-only buses' from today after complaints were apparently made by settlers that mixed buses are a security risk. The Transport Ministry said the two new bus lines, which will run between the occupied West Bank and Israel, is an improvement in the service but rights groups described the move as racist. The left-wing Haaretz daily newspaper reported the ministry opened the lines after Jewish settlers complained of the dangers of having Palestinians on regular buses. A soldier walks in front of a bus destroyed in a suicide bomb attack in 2003. Jewish settlers apparently complained to officials that mixed buses were a 'security risk' The buses, operated by the Afikim company, have been introduced for the thousands of Palestinians who travel between the West Bank and Israel for work. Jessica Montell, director of the B'Tselem rights group, said on Army Radio: 'Creating separate bus lines for Israeli Jews and Palestinians is a revolting plan. 'This is simply racism. Such a plan cannot be justified with claims of security needs or overcrowding.' The new lines have been advertised in Palestinian villages, according to Ynet. The Transport Ministry said the move will 'improve public transport services for Palestinian workers entering Israel' and replace pirate buses charging them 'exorbitant prices'. 'The Ministry of Transport has not issued any instruction or prohibition that prevents Palestinian workers from travelling on public transport in Israel nor in Judea and Samaria,' it said, referring to the West Bank. 'Furthermore, the Ministry of Transport is not authorised to prevent any passenger from using public transport services.' Rights groups, however, voiced concern that Israeli police at checkpoints in the West Bank would remove Palestinian passengers from regular bus lines and order them to use the new ones. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said all Palestinians returning to the West Bank would be searched for stolen property, describing this as a routine Israeli precaution. An Israeli soldier views the identification cards of a Palestinian doctor at a check point. Rights groups have voiced concern that Israeli police will remove Palestinian passengers from regular bus lines at check points . He said he did not know whether and how this might affect Palestinian travel on regular buses. Herzl Ben-Zvi, mayor of the Karnei Shomron settlement, said the new lines 'answer the needs of all passengers - Palestinians and settlers' because they would relieve overcrowding on buses in the area. But a driver told Ynetthat that Palestinians will be 'asked to board their own buses'. He added: 'Obviously, everyone will start screaming ""apartheid"" and ""racism"" now. 'This really . doesn’t feel right, and maybe (the ministry) should find a different . solution, but the situation right now is impossible.' Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war and maintains a network of roadblocks in the territory. Palestinians seek the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, for a future state - a claim supported by most world powers, which view the settlements as illegal.","Settlers apparently complained that mixed buses were a security risk .

"The college friend of John Grisham who inspired the author to claim American men are wrongly being sent to prison for watching child porn - sparking international outrage - was caught sharing sexually explicit images of girls younger than 12 with other internet users, it has emerged. Michael B. Holleman, 59 - who graduated from law at the University of Mississippi with Grisham in 1981 - was arrested in 1997 after sending 13 child porn images featuring girls under 18 - some younger than 12 and depicting intercourse - to an undercover agent in Canada, who then tipped off the FBI. Grisham came under fire this week after saying in an interview that the US judicial system was 'crazy' for putting '60-year-old white men in prison who've never harmed anybody' but have viewed images or videos of children being sexually abused. The prolific novelist was defending an 'old buddy from law school' who, he said, drunkenly accessed pornography featuring '16-year-olds' one night and was caught in an FBI sting operation. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Author John Grisham, who sparked international outrage this week for saying men who watch child porn are sentenced too harshly, was defending a Mississippi friend caught on serious charges . That man has now been named as Michael Holleman - a father who still practices law in Mississippi - by The Telegraph, to whom Grisham first gave his controversial comments. The newspaper cited 'unseen' reports of Holleman's 1997 trial and quoted a US justice department lawyer, Kathy McLure. Prosecutors said Holleman may have faced additional of transmitting pornographic images to Maine, suggesting he had sent the porn to other people, if he hadn't pleaded guilty. Holleman was sentenced to 18 months in prison and disbarred after pleading guilty to one count of possession of child pornography. He claimed that he had been drinking heavily at his legal office when he accessed some 'publicly available computer images of child pornography on the internet'. Holleman thought he had deleted them from his computer and did not print them off, according to a petition to reinstate Holleman to practice law. However they were still on his hard drive after he was presented with a search warrant as part of the FBI investigation. Holleman had a three-year-old son at the time. His marriage fell apart as a result, according to the petition. Following his arrest, Holleman checked himself into COPAC, a renowned addictions treatment facility in Brandon, Mississippi, and also attended Alcoholics Anonymous. On May 19, 1998, Holleman reported to a federal correctional institution, but was released after 15 months after showing evidence of his rehabilitation. As part of his sentence, Holleman was not allowed to practice law for at least three years. Grisham wrote a letter of recommendation for Holleman so that be could be reinstated to the bar in 2002, Jezebel reported. Holleman was eventually reinstated and is currently practicing law in Mississippi. Many fans had already taken to social media to announce they would never buy Grisham's books again following the outlandish comments, especially since he made them while promoting his latest tome, Gray Mountain. 'Anyone who harms a child for profit or pleasure, or who in any way participates in child pornography—online or otherwise—should be punished to the fullest extent of the law,' Grisham said in a statement today. 'My comments made two days ago during an interview with the British newspaper The Telegraph were in no way intended to show sympathy for those convicted of sex crimes, especially the sexual molestation of children. 'I can think of nothing more despicable. I regret having made these comments, and apologize to all.' In the original interview with The Telegraph, Grisham explained described his friend's situation: 'His drinking was out of control, and he went to a website. It was labelled ''sixteen-year-old wannabee hookers'' or something like that. 'So he went there. Downloaded some stuff - it was 16-year-old girls who looked 30. 'He shouldn't have done it. It was stupid, but it wasn't 10-year-old boys. Online reaction: Many 0commented that Grisham's claims don't take into account the victims of sexual abuse involved with child pornography . Outrage: Fans quickly reacted to the controversial comments made by John Grisham, who is currently promoting his latest book, legal thriller Gray Mountain, which will be released next week . 'He didn't touch anything. 'And God, a week later there was a knock on the door: ''FBI!'' and it was sting set up by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to catch people - sex offenders - and he went to prison for three years.' 'There's so many of them now. There's so many ''sex offenders'' - that's what they're called - that they put them in the same prison. 'Like they're a bunch of perverts, or something. 'We've gone nuts with this incarceration.' Grisham was sure to say that he has 'no sympathy for real pedophiles' and believes anyone caught committing such a crime should face harsh penalties. However he believes many men have been penalized too harshly for doing too little. Many readers immediately went online to criticize the author's stance. 'After being a firm favorite of mine for over 20 years, Mr Grisham, I can state with all certainty that I will never purchase another book of yours ever again,' Karen Hanna wrote online, according to stuff.co.nz. 'I am absolutely disgusted at the stance you have taken over child pornography and have lost all respect for you.' Another fan, Bernadine Denham wrote: 'So watching child porn isn't an offence? What a disgusting thing to say. You've lost me.' Grisham is a married father-of-two. He and his wife, Renee Jones, were wed in 1981. They split their time between homes in Oxford, Mississippi, and a Charlottesville, Virginia.

"Women should be encouraged to take up ‘sports’ like cheerleading and ballet, the sports minister Helen Grant has claimed on the day that Britain's women won bronze in the curling at the Winter Olympics. Insisting women did not need to feel ‘unfeminine’ while keeping fit, she said it was possible to look ‘radiant’ and ‘absolutely gorgeous’ while taking part in activities like roller skating and gymnastics. But the remarks from Miss Grant, who is also an equalities minister, were condemned for focussing on the looks of athletes and not their achievements. Glamorous: Sports and equalities minister Helen Grant has suggested cheer leading as a sport for women . Campaigners have battled to encourage more teenage girls to take part in sports at schools by urging them to shed the need to look good at all times. Olympic gold medal winner Jessica Ennis has spoken of her classmates’ reluctance to get ‘hot and sweaty’ when competing. But Miss Grant suggested that women could still feel ‘feminine’ while competing in glamourous sports. ‘There are some wonderful sports which . you can do and perform to a very high level and I think those . participating look absolutely radiant and very feminine such as ballet, . gymnastics, cheerleading and even roller-skating,’ she told the Telegraph. Miss Grant also suggested ballet and rollerskating as sports which women could take part in and still look 'radiant' Miss Grant went on: ‘It’s having a good spread on offer. 'For example some girls may well not like doing very traditional hockey, tennis or athletics, others might, so for those who don’t want to, how about considering maybe gym, ballet, cheerleading?’ She said she had watched girls aged 7-17 rollerblading at a YMCA event. ‘Those girls arrived and they looked absolutely gorgeous. ‘They were wearing their socks pulled up, beautiful socks with sequins and their hair was done. ‘But my goodness they could skate. I felt quite underdressed in my jeans.’ The comments are especially damaging coming on the day that Eve Muirhead led Team GB's women's curling team to a historic win as they beat Switzerland in the bronze match today. The female curling team's win guaranteed that Britain will walk home with the most medals in a Winter Olympics since 1924. Muirhead, . the leader of an all-Scottish team including Anna Sloan, Vicki Adams . and Claire Hamilton,  punched the air in delight after she sealed . victory with the last stone of the 10th end, keeping her cool to take . the point that left the Swiss empty-handed. ‘I am so happy, we are all pushing each other and it makes it more fun to win something,’ she said. Tears of joy: Britain's skip Eve Muirhead, right, embraces Anna Sloan after defeating Switzerland to win the women's curling bronze medal at the 2014 Winter Olympics . Face of a winner: Captain Eve Muirhead led her team to a 6-5 win against Switzerland today . Team win: Great Britain's Claire Hamilton,left, hugs curling legend Rhona Howie as the team celebrate winning their match . Laura Bates, founder of the Everyday Sexism project, insisted Miss Grant was wrong to focus on the looks of sportswomen and suggest the purpose of sport is to be 'girlie and feminine'. “We shouldn’t say women should only do sports while they look radiant and beautiful. It’s actually discouraging for a minister to say this. It suggests the problem is coming from the young women themselves, when I think a big problem is societal responses.' Miss Grant has stumbled before since being handed the sports brief last October. She was left humiliated after she failed to get a single question right in a basic quiz – on sport. She did not know the name of the current Wimbledon women’s champion, who won the FA Cup or the name of the England Rugby captain. In fact she got all five questions wrong in a quiz on ITV Meridian, and ended up pleading with the presenter: ‘Come on, help.' Despite her support for 'feminine' sports, Miss Grant herself has a lengthy sporting pedigree. She was an under-16 judo champion for the north of England and southern Scotland while at school in Carlisle, and also captained the school's tennis and hockey teams, as well as being a county-level athlete, cross-country runner, tennis and hockey player. A DCMS spokesman said: 'It is nonsense that the minister suggested women's participation in sport should be based on looks. 'The point is that there is a sport or physical activity out there for all women. For some it will be tennis or football, for others judo or dance. 'Women decide what they want to do based on their interests and own lives and that choice is up to them.'","Helen Grant condemned for claim women can look 'radiant' playing sport .

"Michael Owen believes Jordan Henderson will make a decent replacement as Liverpool captain when Steven Gerrard brings the curtain down on his time at Anfield, but feels he lacks the quality of the current leader. Writing on his Sportlobster account, Owen describes Henderson as the only real candidate to take over the armband from the man who has been synonymous with Liverpool across the last 17 years. 'I think Jordan Henderson will captain Liverpool, judging on what (Brendan) Rodgers has been saying about him,' Owen explained. 'However, I am reluctant to compare Henderson to Gerrard, as I don't believe he is blessed with the talent of Stevie and I'm not sure he will be able to develop it. Michael Owen (left) pictured lifting the Worthington Cup (now Capital One Cup) with Steven Gerrard (right) Jordan Henderson (left) appears set to takeover as Liverpool captain when Gerrard (right) retires . 'He's a quality player and talkative on the pitch. He plays every game and when you look around the pitch for candidates, there aren't too many obvious choices. 'I think he is a decent replacement as captain, but I wouldn't want to compare him with Gerrard because there aren't too many players in the same league as Gerrard in terms of quality.' The former Liverpool striker Owen, who exited Anfield in 2004 for Real Madrid, hopes Gerrard can avoid injury and enjoy the twilight of his career at his boyhood club. Gerrard missed Liverpool's 2-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday through a groin injury, but could return for the Capital One Cup semi-final clash with Chelsea at Anfield on Tuesday. 'Gerrard's final game at Anfield will have a similar atmosphere to Sir Alex Ferguson's at Old Trafford,' Owen said. 'Hopefully, he will stay fit, healthy and involved for it. 'It will be an unbelievable atmosphere and the fans will give Gerrard the perfect send off. It will be very emotional for Gerrard, as he hasn't known anything else apart from playing for Liverpool. Every game which is now played at Anfield, I am sure the fans will appreciate Gerrard even more.' Owen says Henderson (left) is the only choice to be captain for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (right) Owen added his name to the list  that includes Jamie Carragher and Phil Thompson in thinking more should have been done by Liverpool to extend Gerrard's tenure at the club. 'It is probably a nice move [to LA Galaxy], because he won't be upsetting anyone. He would've liked to stay on with Liverpool, but circumstances conspired against this,'Owen said. 'It is disappointing for everybody that something couldn't have been reached sooner to keep him at the club.'

"Beneath the news anchor's poise and groomed appearance, CNN host Zain Verjee has been hiding a painful secret. Since childhood, the Kenyan-Canadian presenter has battled the debilitating skin condition psoriasis. Miss Verjee, who is host of CNN's European daytime program, told her story today in the hope of bringing attention to a condition which often leaves a sufferer with agonizing sores and living as a virtual recluse. Scroll down for video . Zain Verjee, co-anchor at CNN International, has revealed her battle with psoriasis . In an essay for CNN, Ms Verjee, 39, explains how psoriasis ravaged her entire body from the neck down from a young age. She wrote: 'I have fish-like scales. There are tiny . red islands floating on the surface of my skin. They combine to create . continents with jagged surfaces. 'They turn black and start to smell. There is blood and pus. 'I suffer from psoriasis. It's ravaged my body since I was 8. At its worst my plaques look like leprosy. I feel like a leper.' Miss Verjee described in the essay how she was once asked to leave a pool when she was 22 by another swimmer because of her skin condition. She explains that it has affected the clothes that she chooses to wear and where she will sit in a restaurant. Winter is her favorite time of year because she can cover up. In her teens, the presenter refused to date and shrank from making friends, living out life in her imagination. Zain Verjee began her career at CNN in 2000 as an anchor in Atlanta and now anchors the Europe morning show for CNN International from London . Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin to develop. These patches are normally on the elbows, knees, scalp and lower back but they can appear anywhere on the body. Most people only have small patches but in some cases it can be much more severe. The patches can be very itchy and sore. Psoriasis affects 7.5million Americans and it most often develops in adults under the age of 35. It is a chronic condition which usually involves periods with few symptoms followed by periods with more severe symptoms. It occurs when the body produces too many skin cells which results in a build up. It is thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system, it is also thought to have a genetic element. It is not contagious. There is no cure but it can often be treated effectively with creams, light therapy or injections. Miss Verjee explained that her role as a news broadcaster brings her confidence but that at the heart of it all, her mother has been her saving grace. She wrote: 'I fight my body and myself all my life. I . hit rock bottom many times because of my disease. It seems futile to . try anymore. ''Who will ever want me like this"" I cry hysterically at . home. ""No one could ever touch me."" My mother pulls me out self-loathing . and defeatism. When I want to give up, she will not let me.' By her early twenties, the confidence that her mother instills in her and the mind she has cultivated in the years spent battling her physical appearance propel Miss Verjee to a starring role on a Kenyan prime time show. She describes that how during her first TV appearance, she coated her legs in Vaseline and wrapped them in plastic film to ease the pain and contain the smell of her sores. Miss Verjee's mother spent years researching treatments for psoriasis from Dead Sea salts to acupuncture and hypnosis. But finally it is a friend of her mother's who provides salvation. The presenter is convinced by her mother to attend a small clinic for severe skin diseases in the town of George, South Africa. She was ordered to eat simply banning shellfish, meat, spices, tomatoes and many, many other foods from her diet. Miss Verjee began eating yogurt or bran for breakfast, salads or fish for lunch and chicken for dinner while drinking herbal tea and water. She remembered: 'Nothing tastes good. I yearn for Tabasco.' With the help of meditation, visualization and a strict, simple diet, Miss Verjee experiences a tiny breakthrough in her condition. And then another. And another. Video Source YouTube . Miss Verjee now has a coveted role for CNN in London where she has covered among other things the Royal Wedding . The condition psoriasis leaves suffers with painful red sores and flaky, crusty patches of skin (stock images) She writes: 'I watch with fascination . the metamorphosis of my skin. The continents on my body move apart with . the seismic change in my mind. The scales no longer build. Then they . are gone. I can't believe it.' Miss . Verjee was in remission from psoriasis for a decade between the ages of 24 and 34 which she . puts down to maintaining a strict diet, her state of mind and the . support of family and friends. As . her condition receded, the news presenter's career went from strength . to strength. She left Kenya for a role in DC on The Situation Room with . Wolf Blitzer before transferring to CNN's London bureau. Her psoriasis has since returned and the broadcaster's fight against the condition has begun again. Kim Kardashian is another celebrity who has been vocal about suffering from psoriasis. On an episode of her reality show she uses sister Kourtney's breast milk as a natural healer (left) and showing her condition (right) Britney Spears appearing at an X Factor party showing a flare up of psoriasis on her ankle . Following the publication of her article, support has poured in for the presenter along with many psoriasis sufferers sharing their stories and how they cope with the condition.

"Smokers beware - Queensland Health's latest anti-smoking campaign has revealed the shocking effect smoking has on your face, and it's not pretty. The campaign targets women aged 18 to 24, drawing on their desire to stay youthful and attractive. Young women were lured into a pop-up 'make under station' in Sunshine Plaza on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, where professional make-up artists brought their faces forward into the future as a smoker. Scroll down for video. Smokers beware - Queensland Health's latest anti-smoking campaign has revealed the shocking effect smoking has on your face, and it's not pretty . The campaign targets women aged 18 to 24, drawing on their desire to stay youthful and attractive . The whole idea of the campaign is to highlight the premature ageing effects of smoking, rather than the black lung that is slowly developing inside. Queensland Health is sending out a message to smokers - 'Smoking is not hot!' 'Cigarettes seriously ruin your looks – we’re talking wrinkles, damaged hair and blotchy, saggy skin. You’ll look way older than you actually are. And let’s not forget the yellow teeth and bad breath. Go smoke free. Stay pretty,' Queensland Health writes on their website. Photographs reveal a shock transformation, which means the chance of this  campaign reaching smokers might actually work. No one wants to have blackened teeth, blotchy skin and withered lips - which is what Queensland Health has revealed. Smoking breaks down the collagen supply, which means after 20 years of smoking your skin will not look pretty. Young women were lured into a pop-up 'make under station' in Sunshine Plaza on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland . Professional make-up artists brought your face forward into the future as a smoker . *Smoking causes instant damage to a smoker's hair, nails and skin . *Smoking increases production of an enzyme which breaks down the supply of collagen to the skins structure . *Chemicals in tobacco smoke damage the fibres in the skin that are responsible for its strength and elasticity thus leading to wrinkles, sagging of the eye-lids, bags under the eyes and premature aging on our face and other parts of the body including breast sagging . *Smoking is linked to early onset of menopause in women . Since its launch in May, more than 300 calls were made to the Quitline - an increase of more than 15 per cent, Sunshine Coast Daily reports. The images are a constant reminder of smoker's potential unattractive future, not to mention the deadly effects. New research has found more than 700 harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke, 70 of which could cause cancer. Australian model Rachael Finch has teamed up with Queensland Health to help spread the anti-smoking message across Australia. It is safe to say that most of us would prefer to age beautifully like Ms Finch, rather than some of the after photos taken at the pop up station on the Sunshine Coast. If these pictures don't make you put down a cigarette, then what will? Smoking breaks down the collagen supply, which means after 20 years of smoking your skin will not look pretty .

"Surprise: Andrew Jones stole a bag off a person in a bar in Soho, London, unaware that it was Sir Huge Orde, the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers (pictured) A prolific thief preying on drinkers in the West End got a shock when he tried to snatch the bag of a top policeman, a court heard yesterday. Andrew Jones, 49, targeted Sir Hugh Orde, former Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, and found himself being chased around Soho by ‘a posse of some of the most well-known and distinguished police officers’, Southwark Crown Court was told. Sir Hugh, 55, now president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, was having after-work Christmas drinks in a bar last month with other senior officers and officials when he spotted the crook tampering with his bag. The officer immediately introduced himself before arresting Jones, who has 79 previous convictions for theft. However Jones, a drug user, broke free from Sir Hugh’s grasp and made off, the court was told. Keen marathon runner Sir Hugh chased after him as did his colleague, Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Williams, who re-arrested Jones some 100 yards down the road. Sir Hugh is said to have ‘sat’ on the thief as he and Mr Williams waited for police reinforcements. Peter Zinner, prosecuting, said Jones was seen to take hold of Sir Hugh’s black, holdall-type bag and move it towards him, with a view to stealing either the bag or some of the contents. He added: . ‘Unfortunately for Mr Jones, it took place in the midst of 15 or so of Britain’s most senior police officers and staff, who were in the public house following a meeting.’ The court heard that Sir Hugh told Jones: ‘My name is Hugh Orde. I am a police officer. Why did you move my bag?’. He then arrested Jones and cautioned him for attempted theft. ‘It’s the first arrest he’s made for years!’, Judge Alistair McCreath joked. Mr Zinner added that after Jones broke free ‘what follows is a chase – one of London’s most prolific thieves was being chased down the street by a posse of some of the most well-known and distinguished police officers’. Jones, of Tottenham, North London, admitted attempted theft. He was sentenced to eight months imprisonment and will have to pay a  victim surcharge. Last night Sir Hugh told the Daily Mail: ‘What I did is what frontline officers do every day. After the incident, I rang the Commissioner (Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe) and joked that I was helping to keep the streets safe! He thanked me.’ Area: Sir Hugh was having Christmas drinks with colleagues in a bar in Soho when he was targeted .

"Running robots have been inspired by nature’s fastest runners, including the cheetah and the ostrich. But one group of researchers has looked further back in time for their inspiration and created a speedy droid based on the now extinct velociraptor, which lived between 75 and 71 million years ago. The robo-raptor has two powerful legs that can propel it to speeds of 28.5mph (46km/h) which is just fast enough to beat Usain Bolt in a race. Cool runnings: The robot (pictured) has a top speed of 28.6mph (46km/h) and is inspired by a velociraptor . The machine was created by a team of engineers at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (Kaist) and has a mechanism that mimics a tail, as well as its two nimble legs, Discovery News reported. In one test run, the robot recorded a top speed of 28.5mph (46km/h) on a treadmill, which is almost as fast as a cheetah bot – the world’s fastest legged robot – which can run at 29mph (47km/h). In comparison, the world’s fastest sprinter, Usain Bolt, can run at 27.4mph (44.7km/h). Th chase is on: The robo-raptor has two powerful legs and has a top speed of 28.6mph (46km/h).

Ancient: A group of researchers from Korea have have created a speedy robot based on a ferocious velociraptor (pictured) which was one of the dinosuars to terrify children in the film Jurassic Park . While Boston Robotics’ cheetah is heavy, four-legged and powered by hydraulics, the robotic velociraptor weighs just under 7lbs (3kg) and has two legs made of carbon fibre. Each of the legs has an Achilles tendon to works as a shock absorber. The Raptor has a tail, which while dissimilar to the dinosaur’s, helps it keep its body more stable while it jumps over obstacles, Jongwon Park, a PhD student at Kaist, Korea said. This capability was tested by the researchers throwing obstacles onto the treadmill for the robot to negotiate. The tail swings from side to side as the robot runs to act as a counterweight and stop the robot plunging forwards and backwards, Cnet reported. But both sprinting bots rely on poles to stop them falling over, giving Usain Bolt a large advantage is a race was ever run between man and robot.

"New York on Tuesday elected the U.S. Congress's youngest female member ever -- 30-year-old Republican Elise Stefanik. The Bush administration veteran took 56 percent of the 21st district, which includes much of the sparsely populated Adirondack Mountains in the state's northernmost reaches. She's the first woman to ever hold the seat, which was vacated by Democrat Bill Owens. Youngest ever: New York on Tuesday elected the U.S. Congress's youngest female member ever -- 30-year-old Republican Elise Stefanik . Just 10 weeks after her 30th birthday, Stefanik has become the youngest woman of either party ever elected to Congress . New York also hosted the previous youngest female member of Congress Democrat Elizabeth Holtzman, who was 31 when she was sworn in back in 1979, notes ABC News. Just 10 weeks after her 30th birthday, Stefanik has become the youngest woman of either party ever elected to Congress. 'It's not news to anyone that Republicans have struggled to reach out to voters in my specific demographic: young women who are professional, not married — that was one of President Obama's most enthusiastic voting blocs,' Stefanik, who worked to defeat Obama as a member of Mitt Romney's campaign, said during a September tour of small businesses along Old Forge's bustling main drag. 'There is an appetite in this district for a new type of Republican.' The party's 'women problem' was well-documented in the Republican National Committee's 2012 postelection report. It helped spawn a program instituted by House Republicans last summer, Project Grow, that includes renewed focus on recruitment, training and fundraising for promising female candidates nationwide. Stefanik is among the program's beneficiaries, who are spread across the country. It is a long-term effort, GOP officials say, and one that is critical to the party's future. 'The job of the party committees is to recruit the best candidates possible, and this cycle we have an outstanding field of women candidates running across the country,' says Andrea Bozek, spokeswoman for the National Republican Campaign Committee, which leads Project Grow. Project Grow has been slow to produce results, however. The number of Republican women set to appear on the ballot in House races this fall is roughly the same as in prior elections, according to Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Republicans had 47 Republican women on the ballot in 2010 and 2012 elections, down from a high of 53 female candidates in 2004; there will be at least 51 this November after Tuesday's primaries. 'There's a lot attention on women in general in this election,' Walsh said. 'But it's a trajectory that appears to be moving in the wrong direction.' There are few opportunities for Republican women in part because there are so few congressional seats in play every two years. Redistricting has given GOP incumbents a stronger grip on the vast majority of their 234 seats, and Republican leaders aren't willing to encourage promising female candidates to challenge incumbents. Stefanik found an opening in New York's 21st Congressional District, where her father still runs the plywood distribution company he founded two decades ago. The seat, held by retiring three-term incumbent Democratic Rep. Bill Owens, was considered one of the GOP's top pick-up opportunities. A veteran Washington operative years before she turned 30, Stefanik fought through residency questions to win her party's nomination in late June. She opposed a better-known Republican businessman with the help of establishment-minded super PACs that funneled more than $1 million into the primary contest on her behalf. 'I may be the only woman who was looking forward to her 30th birthday,' Stefanik said with a laugh during a recent interview. She says she's particularly concerned with the exodus of young people from the region. She often refers to 'my generation' and 'people my age' while talking to voters who worry aloud about the area's economic challenges. Some concede that her age was a factor — at least at first. 'That was everybody's first impression: She's just too young,' says Chip Kiefer, whose Old Forge's Souvenir Village displayed an 'Elise for Congress' sign on its front window. 'But having young energy is a good thing for us.' The Bush administration veteran took 56 percent of the 21st district, which includes much of the sparsely populated Adirondack Mountains in the state's northernmost reaches .","Stefanik took 56 percent of the 21st district, which includes much of the sparse Adirondacks  in the state's northernmost reaches .

"The brave and quick thinking efforts of the two police officers who saved a woman just seconds from drowning in her car after it plunged into a harbour have humbly insisted their heroic act wa all just part of the job. Incredible images show officers Paul Watts and Simon Russell rescuing the petrified 63-year-old woman from the car, which was rapidly sinking into Waitemata Harbour in Auckland at 3pm on Tuesday. Watts modestly described the dramatic rescue as 'pretty much part of a routine job being a police officer', saying the whole rescue only took about 40 seconds - and that 40 seconds later the car completely vanished beneath the water. The courageous officers received a call from New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush on Tuesday afternoon to commend them on their efforts. Russell told the commissioner, 'it's just another day on the job, sir',stuff.co.nz reported. Scroll down for video .

The woman is extremely lucky to be alive after her car careered off a rock wall of a car park into a New Zealand harbour and immediately began sinking at a frightening speed. The terrified woman, who is yet to be identified, was squashed up against the rear window as the front end of the BMW was rapidly nosediving into the harbour . The officers and a bystander couldn't open the car doors so Russell attempted to break the driver window with a spanner that he found on the ocean floor when he cut his left hand. 'When we entered the water, I was talking to one of the (members of the public) who was trying to balance the vehicle and he said he was looking for a rock to try and smash the window,' Russell told the New Zealand Herald. He said once his spanner failed his fellow officer Watts successfully smashed through the rear window with a rock - by which time the car was sinking at an alarming rate. 'At that time the car actually started to move very fast into the water. I was trying to hold the car, slowing it down from entering the water,' Russell said. The officers then managed to pull the woman from the car to safety, but said they got her out just in time. 'It was pretty close, probably 30 or 40 seconds after we managed to get the female out of the car, the car was already slipping further into the water,'  Watts said. 'I'd say she'd probably only had maximum probably another minute, minute-and-a-half if she hadn't got out,' he said. The car was fully submerged less than a minute after the woman was freed from it.

"Prisoners on licence who go on the run after breaking the terms of their release will face up to two additional years behind bars. The measure will tackle the 800 inmates a year who abscond rather than be sent back to jail – and then face no additional punishment when they are found. Judges will now be given powers to impose an additional penalty when the offender is returned, depending how long they have been at large. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the new measure will stop inmates 'getting away' with absconding and result in more fugitives being returned quickly to jail . At the moment, criminals simply stay in prison until the end of their original sentence. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the new measure will stop inmates ‘getting away’ with absconding and result in more fugitives being returned quickly to jail. Warwick Spinks, known as the 'Pied Piper of Paedophiles', fled abroad for 15 years after his early release from jail in 1997 . Warning that ‘punishment must mean . punishment’ he added: ‘It is unacceptable that criminals who disregard . the law and attempt to evade the authorities are able to do so with . impunity. ‘I am today sending a clear message to those people that if you try to avoid serving your sentence you will face the consequences when you are caught. ‘I think the hard-working taxpayers of this country would expect nothing less than tough punishment for offenders who try and beat the system. ‘We’re on the side of people who work hard and want to get on and my message is simple – if you break the law, you will not get away with it.’ The policy, to be formally announced within days, will create a new offence of being unlawfully at large following recall to custody. Every year around 16,000 criminals on licence are recalled to prison – for committing a further offence, or breaking the terms of their release by contacting their victims, breaking a curfew or going abroad. Warwick Andrew Spinks, known as the ‘Pied Piper of Paedophiles’, fled abroad for 15 years after his early release from jail in 1997. But after being hauled back to Britain, the 48-year-old was only forced to serve the remaining three months of his prison term. Under the new system, he could have faced two more years.","Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said new measure will stop inmates 'getting away' with absconding .

"A pair of hungry thieves got a little more than they bargained for when police spotted them eating quiche in a cafe that had closed for the day. Upon realising they had been caught red-handed, the two men armed themselves with knives and had to be talked out of the 50-seater Cafe@Marshalls in Berwick-upon-Tweed by police negotiators. They eventually gave themselves up after five hours and were arrested for aggravated burglary. Angela Marshall, who runs the cafe with her husband Howard, went to the scene at 1am on Monday when she heard about the stand off and was told that they just wanted some flan. Hungry: The thieves broke into Cafe @Marshalls, in the early hours of Monday in an apparent attempt to steal some quiche sparking a five hour stand off with police . The men were eventually brought out of the cafe and arrested at 6am. Mrs Marshall said: 'Apparently they were hungry and wanted some quiche. There was a little bit of money in the till, but I think they just wanted food and then it got out of hand. 'It obviously must be very good quiche.' Shocked: Howard and Angela Marshall who own the leisure shop where Cafe @Marshalls is based . According to Mrs Marshall, there was around 15 police cars surrounding the store when she arrived shortly after 1am. She said: 'There was negotiators and all sorts. They had riot gear on and Tasers. 'From what I can gather the men had smashed a window and climbed through it. The police were driving past and saw two lads in the cafe and called back-up. 'But when they saw the police they grabbed some knives and started threatening them. 'They were in there a long time and they trashed the cafe.' Northumbria Police confirmed that two men, aged 21 and 20 have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary. A force spokesman said: 'The two men were armed with knives, refused to come out of the premises and threatened police.

"The fiery derailment of a train carrying crude oil in West Virginia is one of three in the past year involving tank cars that already meet a higher safety standard than federal law requires - leading some to suggest even tougher requirements that industry representatives say would be prohibitively costly. Hundreds of families were evacuated and nearby water treatment plants were temporarily shut down after cars derailed from a train carrying three million gallons of North Dakota crude Monday, shooting fireballs into the sky, leaking oil into a Kanawha River tributary and burning down a house nearby. It was snowing at the time, but it is not yet clear if weather was a factor. The train's tanks were a newer model - the 1232 - designed during safety upgrades voluntarily adopted by the industry four years ago. Scroll down for videos . Fire burns at the scene of a train derailment, near Mount Carbon, West Virginia . Governor Earl Ray Tomblin, second from left, and General James Hoyer stand near the derailed train cars the day after the accident . Train cars remain on the scene following the derailment near Mount Carbon . Oil shipments by rail jumped from 9,500 carloads in 2008 to more than 435,000 in 2013 . Residents of Boomer, directly across the Kanawha River from the derailment, were evacuated from their homes after train crashed . The CSX train, carrying more than 100 tankers of crude oil, derailed in a snowstorm, threatening the water supply of nearby residents . The same model spilled oil and caught fire in Timmins, Ontario on Saturday, and last year in Lynchburg, Virginia. A series of ruptures and fires have prompted the administration of President Barack Obama to consider requiring upgrades such as thicker tanks, shields to prevent tankers from crumpling, rollover protections and electronic brakes that could make cars stop simultaneously, rather than slam into each other. If approved, increased safety requirements now under White House review would phase out tens of thousands of older tank cars being used to carry highly flammable liquids. 'This accident is another reminder of the need to improve the safety of transporting hazardous materials by rail,' said Christopher Hart, acting chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. But industry officials say upgrading further from the 1232 cars would be too costly. The Railway Supply Institute says an estimated $7 billion has already been spent to put 57,000 of these cars into service. 'We have billions invested in tank cars,' Bob Greco, a senior official with the American Petroleum Institute, told The Associated Press in July. 'Every day new, modern 1232 tank cars are coming into service.' Oil shipments by rail jumped from 9,500 carloads in 2008 to more than 435,000 in 2013, driven by a boom in the Bakken oil patch of North Dakota and Montana, where pipeline limitations force 70 percent of the crude to move by rail, according to American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. The downside: Trains hauling Bakken-region oil have been involved in major accidents in Virginia, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Alabama and Canada, where 47 people were killed by an explosive derailment in 2013 in Lac-Megantic, Quebec. Reports of leaks and other oil releases from tank cars are up as well, from 12 in 2008 to 186 last year, according to Department of Transportation records reviewed by The Associated Press. Just Saturday — two days before the West Virginia wreck — 29 cars of a 100-car Canadian National Railway train carrying diluted bitumen crude derailed in a remote area 50 miles south of Timmins, Ontario, spilling oil and catching fire. That train was headed from Alberta to Eastern Canada. Fires burned for hours after the train came off the tracks on a stretch where the rails wind past businesses and homes crowded between the water and the steep, tree-covered hills . Responders throw oil booms into the Kanawha River near the site of the crash . A huge fireball soars into the sky after the derailment of the train carrying three million gallons of oil . The train derailed near unincorporated Mount Carbon just after passing through Montgomery, a town of 1,946 . The train Monday was bound for an oil shipping depot in Yorktown, Virginia, along the same route where three tanker cars plunged into the James River in Lynchburg, Virginia, prompting an evacuation last year. The train derailed near unincorporated Mount Carbon just after passing through Montgomery, a town of 1,946, on a stretch where the rails wind past businesses and homes crowded between the water and the steep, tree-covered hills. All but two of the train's 109 cars were tank cars, and 26 of them left the tracks. Fire crews had little choice but to let the tanks burn themselves out. Each carried up to 30,000 gallons of crude. Oil cars were still burning Tuesday evening. One person — the owner of the destroyed home — was treated for smoke inhalation, but no other injuries were reported, according to the train company, CSX. The two-person crew, an engineer and conductor, managed to decouple the train's engines from the wreck behind it and walk away unharmed. The NTSB said its investigators will compare this wreck to others including Lynchburg and one near Casselton, N.D., when a Bakken crude train created a huge fireball that forced the evacuation of the farming town. No cause has been determined, said CSX regional vice president Randy Cheetham. He said the tracks had been inspected just three days before the wreck. 'They'll look at train handling, look at the track, look at the cars. But until they get in there and do their investigation, it's unwise to do any type of speculation,' he said. By Tuesday evening, power crews were restoring electricity, water treatment plants were going back online, and most of the local residents were back home. Initial tests showed no crude near water plant intake points, state Environmental Protection spokeswoman Kelley Gillenwater said. Fire crews had little choice but to let the tanks burn themselves out. Some were still alight on Tuesday . Each tank was carrying around 30,000 gallons of crude oil. Some leaked into a nearby river . State officials do have some say over rail safety. Railroads are required by federal order to tell state emergency officials where trains carrying Bakken crude are traveling. CSX and other railroads called this information proprietary, but more than 20 states rejected the industry's argument, informing the public as well as first-responders about the crude moving through their communities. West Virginia is among those keeping it secret. State officials responded to an AP Freedom of Information request by releasing documents redacted to remove nearly every detail. There are no plans to reconsider after this latest derailment, said Melissa Cross, a program manager for the West Virginia Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.","Train carrying three million gallons of oil derailed near Mount Carbon .

"Ominous clouds gathered over a Michigan city on Monday night, leading residents to question what was causing the bulbous formations and if they were a sign of rough weather ahead. As the orange-tinged clouds were spotted at about 8.30pm above Iron Mountain, residents posted pictures of them on social media to see if anyone could identify what they were. Meteorologist Jeff Last was finally able to resolve the mystery through Twitter, when he identified the phenomenon as Mammatus. Scroll down for video . Strange forecast: Joe Nottage took pictures of the clouds as they gathered over Iron Mountain . His tweet was in response to a picture Joe Nottage had put online, as he asked: 'Can anyone explain this?' Skye reported. Another resident, Jason Asselin, filmed the clouds as they gathered over the city. 'All of a sudden it got very yellow outside, it felt strange and mysterious,' he wrote on YouTube. 'It was the craziest thing I have ever witnessed over my head. I almost expected to see a tornado or something.' Eerie: The sky was tinged with orange as the bulbous clouds appeared, catching the attention of many residents . Mammatus are bulbous formations that are found under other clouds. While most clouds have flat bottoms, Mammatus have round pouches that are caused by sinking air. This has led to cloud physicists referring to the shape as being caused by negative buoyancy. Their name is said to be derived from the Latin for breast. The clouds, which often form in turbulent air, can stretch for hundreds of miles and can be a sign of a gathering storm. For the clouds to form, there must be a sharp change in temperature. His . assumption that the formation, which gathers under a larger cloud, is a . forewarning of severe weather was close to the truth. The clouds, which are formed after a sharp change in temperature or moisture, can sometimes be a sign of an approaching thunderstorm or, in some cases, a tornado. Other people struggled to describe the strange and beautiful weather phenomenon. In his blog for the city's Daily News, Chris Tomassucci said: 'The pictures really don't capture how eerie the whole experience was.' He added: 'The mammatocumulus that formed over Iron Mountain made everything take on strange coloration. Greens looked more green, blues more blue, and so on.'

"Women in their thirties are earning more than men for the first time on record, new figures show. In recent years, full-time female workers have earned higher hourly wages than men in their 20s, but then suffer poorer pay in their 30s. This gap then widens in their 40s, 50s and 60s. But now, statistics show women are staving off the gender pay gap for longer by having a family later in life. New figures show that female workers are now earning 0.2 per cent more than men aged 30 to 39 (file picture) According to the Office for National Statistics, men earn more in their teenage years but then women are paid one per cent more between 22 and 29. New figures show that female workers are also now earning 0.2 per cent more than men aged 30 to 39, after creeping marginally ahead. But when they hit their 40s, women fall 14 per cent behind their male colleagues for hourly wages, a trend which continues until they retire. The average age of mothers in England and Wales is now 30.1 compared to 29.8 two years ago meaning more women are having children well into their thirties. Adam Memon, at the Centre for Policy Studies, said: ‘The fact that women are now earning more in their thirties may well be because they are having children later. ‘A great proportion of the gender gap has been about the ‘motherhood gap’, where women leave the labour market to have children and return perhaps in a different capacity or reduced wage.’ He said he expected the gender pay gap between men and women in their 40s and 50s should also narrow as a new generation of females who are ‘achieving their potential early in their professional careers’ reach middle age. The gender pay gap has narrowed over the last year and is now 9.4 per cent compared to 10 per cent in 2013. Minister for Women and Equalities Nicky Morgan (pictured) said: ‘I am delighted that the gender pay gap has reduced to its lowest point in history' This is the lowest since records began but women continue to earn about £100 less than men every week. Full-time women earn a median salary of £23,900 while men earn £29,400, the ONS said. Academics said the fact that women in their thirties had overtaken men was also indicative of a new generation of empowered, highly educated women who were fighting the gender pay gap. Women in their twenties and thirties are more likely to have attended university and embarked on professional careers than their mothers and grandmothers. Minister for Women and Equalities Nicky Morgan said: ‘I am delighted that the gender pay gap has reduced to its lowest point in history. British workers are suffering the worst pay rises on record after wages crept up by just £1 a week in the year to April, the Office for National Statistics said. Average weekly earnings for full time staff grew from £517 to £518 following a 0.1 per cent pay rise. This is the smallest growth in wages since records began 17 years ago. Adjusted for inflation, weekly earnings fell by 1.6 per cent in the year, continuing the downward trend which began seven years ago. Public sector pay increased four times as fast as private sector pay. ‘However, there is more to be done and the Government will continue to work with industry to make sure it reduces even further.’ Petra Wilton, of the Chartered Management Institute, said: ‘It is great news that women in their 30s are now earning a little more than men across all roles. ‘However, women in senior management roles and those over 40 are still facing significant pay gaps. ‘The delay in this gap emerging can in part be attributed to the effect of women putting their careers first and delaying motherhood until they reach their 30s. ‘But it also shows that employers still have much more to do ensure that those valued women in their mid-careers are not missing out when they start a family, and have opportunities to continue to contribute through well-paid, quality professional roles. ‘Otherwise, they’ll find many of their most talented employees vote with their feet and leave.’ The ONS said: ‘The gap is negative for the 22-29 and 30-39 age groups, meaning that women earn on average more than men. ‘Thereafter, there is a relatively large positive gap. ‘This is likely to be connected with the fact that many women have children and take time out of the labour market.’ Thy said it was the first time on record that full-time women in their thirties earned higher hourly wages than men.","Women in their 30s are earning 0.2 per cent more than men aged 30 to 39 .

"Anonymous has published the names of men who allegedly gang-raped a cheerleader at a party 12 years ago - after she turned to the hacking group for help following the Steubenville case. Amanda Stevenson, 26, contacted the group after returning to Laurelville, Ohio, where she was raped when she was 14, with the intention of gathering evidence from her case - and discovering the sheriff's department no longer had it. Fearing that authorities in the close-knit community were failing to help her chase her alleged attackers, she contacted Anonymous after reading that they had helped bring the Steubenville case to national attention. That case, in which two students were . prosecuted in a close-knit Ohio community after Anonymous leaked videos and photographs of the attack, . was similar to her own, she said. Now with the help of Anonymous, police have re-opened the case. But she told MailOnline that, due to problems working with authorities in Laurelville, she is uncertain if she will ever see a conviction. Fighting back: Amanda Stevenson, pictured with her fiance Tim Tolka, is seeking justice 12 years after she was gang-raped as a high school freshman. She is seeking help from hacking group Anonymous . 'I do not think there is a chance I will see any of those guys convicted,' she said. 'There isn't evidence because it's been discarded or destroyed. But I'm coming forward because this is about authorities being held accountable.' Stevenson . said that the horrific attack unfolded as she attended her first high . school party at a remote hunting cabin with her boyfriend when she was a . high school freshman. When her boyfriend wanted to leave, she decided . to stay and agreed to get a ride back with someone else. When . he left, someone handed her a Mountain Dew drink and after drinking it, . she told Mother Jones that her limbs began to go limp and she lost the ability to talk. She . said she remembers being locked inside a room with five boys before . they began passing her around, grabbing her. She said three raped her - . while she could do nothing to stop them. After one of the boys drove her home . the next morning, she told her parents about the attack and they took . her to the local hospital where she took a rape test. Strong: She said she is still haunted by the rape but said she was unable to deal with the investigation as a teen . Records show the hospital contacted . the Hocking County Sheriff's Department. She said she was too scared at . the time to tell authorities the names of her alleged attackers. When . she returned to school, rumors began that she had made up the rape . story so that people did not call her a slut for having sex with the . boys, and when deputies started interviewing students, she said she . received threats. Eventually she moved to Virginia to live with her . father. Hacking group Anonymous played a central role in the Steubenville rape case. Two football stars Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik . Richmond, 16, were convicted of the rape in March. They were sentenced to a . minimum of one year in a juvenile detention institution with a maximum . stay until they are 21. The case emerged after Steubenville football players made fun of the 16-year-old victim, who was passed around and raped in August 2012, by spreading videos and pictures of her. An Anonymous hacker, known as KYAnonymous and now revealed as security consultant Deric Lostutter, 26, was responsible for publicizing these videos and images. They inspired greater public interest in the case. In December, hackers with Anonymous and . KnightSec posted a video on a fan site for the Steubenville football team, threatening to release personal . information of those involved in the Steubenville rape case if they did . not come forward and apologize. The FBI is now investigating Lostutter for his role. In a bizarre twist, if convicted of any hacking-related crimes, . Lostutter faces up to 10 years in federal prison - nine more years than . the minimum sentence for the convicted Steubenville rapists. In April, Anonymous vowed to expose the identities of four boys who raped a 17-year-old girl who subsequently killed herself after they circulated a photograph of the assault. The hacking collective said that they knew who two of the supposed culprits were and that they were confirming the identity of a third before putting them on the Internet. In a post the group added that it was ‘only a matter’ of time before they got the fourth as well. Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, hanged herself in her family's bathroom in Novia Scotia, Canada, two months ago after being relentlessly tormented. She said the sheriff's department . eventually dropped the case, saying they did not know where the assault . had taken place and did not have any names for alleged attackers. When Stevenson read the story about the . rape in Steubenville, in which an incapacitated 16-year-old girl was . passed around athletes in August 2012, she said she saw similarities with her own case. When she contacted CNN about running . her story in the wake of Steubenville, a journalist encouraged her to . gather as much of the evidence from her case as she could. She returned to the hospital and . collected her medical records, which noted she had been the victim of a . sexual assault and had been referred to Hocking County Sheriff's . Department. But when she went to the department, . they had no record of her investigation and no longer had the clothes . she had been wearing the night of the attack, she said. She also discovered that her rape kit . was no longer stored and she was eventually told it had been destroyed in . an 'act of vandalism' when a fridge had been knocked over, she said. She said she also learned deputies had compiled a list containing 'six or seven' names during their initial investigation. When asked why authorities would fail to help her, Stevenson said: 'I've . asked myself that. It's a stereotypical Midwest, Ohio town. Football . rules, wrestling rules. They were wrestling stars and with that comes . entitlement.' She added that while it is one thing . that the case was mishandled in the past, it is another that she believes the case . continues to be mishandled. 'In my mind it's in your interest to find what the problems are [with your law enforcement],' she said. 'You can be an example of a small . town that has recognized its errors and taken a strong stance to change . it - because you respect your mothers and your sisters and your . daughters.' The couple decided to make a plea on the private page of Operation . Abuse Awareness, an Anonymous-affiliated website set up after . Steubenville. They included names and contacts of her attackers. Within hours, they started talking to . a member with the screen name Jonathan Perez, who then re-posted the . information to his public website. Attack: The victim of the Steubenville rape case is pictured in a photo that was shared on social networks . While the couple were shocked he had published this sensitive information, they were overjoyed when Hocking County detective Caleb Moritz contacted Perez on Facebook . 'I would like to speak to you, or the . person with the new information, so that we might further investigate . the case and bring the perpetrator(s) to justice,' the detective said. A week later, Moritz traveled to Virginia to interview Stevenson and let her know that the department had reopened her case. But Moritz was worried about Perez's . website and feared the alleged attackers could read the information and . use it to craft an alibi. When the couple contacted Perez, he said . he had forgotten the password to remove the information. Authorities told Mother Jones that . there were problems with the case - thanks to this public information . and because of the lack of kept evidence. Convicted: Trent Mays, 17, left, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were convicted of raping the girl last year . 'We don't want to jeopardize an investigation,' Hocking County Chief Deputy David Valkinburgtold said. 'But she's called some people before we even had a chance to interview any suspects.' The department failed to return a request from MailOnline seeking comment. Stevenson has also received help from . the Attorney General's office but when representatives went to the . sheriff's department to offer assistance, it was declined, she said. Refusing to give up, she contacted . her congressman and the sheriff has now accepted the Attorney General's help, Stevenson said. 'That was a huge victory at the time,' she said. 'Now we get our case investigated by someone who is independent of the county.' Hackers: Help from Anonymous has had mixed results but police have now re-opened the case . Stevenson said she now hopes to work with legislatures to improve objective investigations for the victims of sexual abuse. She accepts she might not get . the justice she craves because of the lack of evidence. But she hopes to . add to the pressure on law enforcement to take rape cases seriously. She said she was not equipped to . deal with the attack when she was so young, but now she is willing to fight as hard as she can for justice. 'I am more stable . and can revisit it without it crippling me,' she said.","Amanda Stevenson, 26, says she is still haunted by the attack in Laurelville, Ohio which occurred when she was 14 .

"It’s generally accepted that planets form before moons, gradually collecting their natural satellites over millions or billions of years in cosmic tugs of war. But new research could be set to turn the world of planetary science on its head, as scientists have discovered Titan may have formed before its parent planet Saturn. The incredible theory rules out the possibility that Titan formed in the disk of material that surrounded the infant Saturn - and instead it must have formed elsewhere. Titan (pictured) is the largest moon of Saturn and, like other natural satellites in the solar system, it was thought to have been born out of a disk of material surrounding its host planet. New research, however, suggests its origins may actually pre-date that of Saturn, challenging our understanding of planetary science . The combined Nasa and Esa study was led by Kathleen Mandt of Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. With . its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a . frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began . pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because . Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn’t hold onto its . gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on . Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight . that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about . seven Earth years long. Titan's ‘water’ is liquid methane, CH4, . better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be . frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180°C (-292°F). With . Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow . twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall . more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains . perhaps only every few decades. The researchers found firm evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan actually originated in conditions pre-dating Saturn. In fact, Titan’s nitrogen bears similarities to ancient comets found in the Oort cloud - a vast expanse of icy rocks surrounding the solar system. The main implication of this new research is that Titan's building blocks formed early in the solar system's history, in the cold disk of gas and dust that formed the sun. This was also the birthplace of many comets, which retain a primitive, or largely unchanged, composition today. Nitrogen is also the main ingredient in the atmosphere of Earth (it makes up about 78 per cent), as well as on Titan. The planet-sized moon of Saturn is frequently compared to an early version of Earth, locked in a deep freeze. The research suggests that information about Titan's original building blocks is still present in the icy moon's atmosphere, allowing researchers to test different ideas about how the moon might have formed. The formation of our solar system began 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant molecular cloud (illustration shown). While our sun took shape at its heart, further out in colder regions comets began to form. The new research suggests Titan, too, formed in these colder regions before Saturn . Mandt and colleagues demonstrated that a particular chemical hint as to the origin of Titan's nitrogen should be essentially the same today as when this moon formed, up to 4.6 billion years ago. That hint is the ratio of one isotope (form) of nitrogen called nitrogen-14 to another isotope, nitrogen-15. The small . amount of change in this isotope ratio over long time periods makes it . possible for researchers to compare Titan's original building blocks to . other solar system objects in search of connections between them. As . planetary scientists investigate the mystery of how the solar system . formed, isotope ratios are one of the most valuable types of clues they . are able to collect. In . planetary atmospheres and surface materials, the specific amount of one . form of an element, like nitrogen, relative to another form of that . same element can be a powerful diagnostic tool because it is closely . tied to the conditions under which materials form. The team found that our solar system is not old enough for this nitrogen isotope ratio to have changed significantly. This is contrary to what scientists commonly assumed. ‘When we looked closely at how this ratio could evolve with time, we found that it was impossible for it to change significantly,’ explained Mandt. ‘Titan's atmosphere contains so much nitrogen that no process can significantly modify this tracer even given more than four billion years of solar system history.’ Pictured is Saturn (background) and Titan (foreground), the latter of which is by far the largest of Saturn's 62 confirmed moons. Evidence for Titan's formation before Saturn stems from the ratio of two isotopes of nitrogen in its atmosphere, the ratio of which could not have come about if it formed after Saturn . The study also has implications for Earth - it supports the emerging view that ammonia ice from comets is not likely to be the primary source of Earth's nitrogen. In the past, researchers assumed a connection between comets, Titan and Earth, and supposed the nitrogen isotope ratio in Titan's original atmosphere was the same as that ratio is on Earth today. Measurements of the nitrogen isotope ratio at Titan by several instruments of the Nasa and Esa Cassini-Huygens mission showed that this is not the case - meaning this ratio is different on Titan and Earth - while measurements of the ratio in comets have borne out their connection to Titan. This means the sources of Earth's and Titan's nitrogen must have been different. Other researchers previously have shown that Earth's nitrogen isotope ratio likely has not changed significantly since our planet formed. 'Some have suggested that meteorites brought nitrogen to Earth, or that nitrogen was captured directly from the disk of gas that formed the Sun,' said Mandt. 'This is an interesting puzzle for future investigations,' Mandt said. The ratio of nitrogen suggests Titan's origins bear a similarity to comets found in the Oort cloud, which is a vast expanse of the icy rocks thought to be surrounding the solar system at a distance of up to a light year (illustration shown). This would make Titan the first moon confirmed to be older than its parent planet . Mandt and colleagues are eager to see whether their findings are supported by data from Esa's Rosetta mission, when it studies comet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko beginning later this year. If their analysis is correct, the comet should have a lower ratio of two isotopes - in this case of hydrogen in methane ice - than the ratio on Titan. In essence, they believe this chemical ratio on Titan is more similar to Oort cloud comets than comets born in the Kuiper Belt, which begins near the orbit of Neptune (67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko is a Kuiper Belt comet). 'This exciting result is a key example of Cassini science informing our knowledge of the history of solar system and how Earth formed,' added Scott Edgington, Cassini deputy project scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.","San Antonio-led researchers claim Titan's origins pre-date those of Saturn .

'You can see the context and also zoom in to see very fine details.' Deen . assembled the image using 850 frames from the telephoto camera of . Curiosity's Mast Camera instrument. He then supplemented in 21 frames from the . Mastcam's wider-angle camera and 25 black-and-white frames -- mostly of . the rover itself -- from the Navigation Camera. The images were taken on several different Mars days between 5 October and 16 November 2012. Earlier this year photographer Andrew Bodrov used the Curiosity images to assemble his own mosaic views of the planet, including at least one gigapixel scene. His mosaic shows illumination effects from variations in the time of day for pieces of the mosaic. It also shows variations in the clarity of the atmosphere due to variable dustiness during the month while the images were acquired. This image, taken of an area on Mars called Rock Nest, is a scaled-down version from the 360-degree panorama. Nearly 900 images were taken by cameras attached to Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover and stitched together .

Bodrov also spent two weeks . creating the interactive image below using 407 pictures from the narrow angle . and medium angle cameras on the head of the rover, and included a bit . of digital retouching. '[The camera] is only two megapixels, which by today's standards is not huge,' he told Popular Science. 'Of course, flying these electronic components from Earth to Mars, and having them survive the radiation and other hazards, means that they were not able to just use off-the-shelf cameras.' Mars Gigapixel Panorama - Curiosity rover: Martian solar days 136-149 in The World . Bodrov added the sky and a previous picture of Curiosity to the 90,000 x 45,000 pixel panorama with Photoshop. In March, Nasa chiefs were relieved when a computer glitch that had stopped operations for a week was solved, meaning they could get back to examining rock powder found on the planet. From April 4, radio communications between Earth and Mars will be blocked by the sun, meaning work will be halted again until May 1. For now, the £2billion six-wheel rover, which landed on the planet in August to begin its two-year mission, will continue to analyse the rock sample, which contains all the chemical ingredients necessary for life. Andrew Bodrov's panorama uses 407 pictures from the Mars Curiosity rover's cameras . Scientists identified sulphur, nitrogen, . hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon in the powder Curiosity drilled out of a . sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed in an area known as Yellowknife Bay within Gale Crater. They believe that billions of . years ago water poured down the rim of the crater and formed streams . that might have been up to three feet deep. At the time of the discovery project scientist John Grotzinger said: 'We have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life, that probably if this water was around and you had been there, you would have been able to drink it. The £2billion six-wheel rover, right, is analysing rock powder found on Mars which has been shown to contain all the necessary elements for life . Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program at the agency's headquarters in Washington, added: 'A fundamental question for this mission is whether Mars could have supported a habitable environment. 'From what we know now, the answer is yes.' Scientists eventually plan to drive the rover to a three-mile-high mound of what appears to be layered sediment rising from the floor of Gale Crater.","The image is the first Nasa-produced panoramic shot of the red planet taken by its Mars Curiosity Rover .

"An architect has thought outside the box to house the homeless - by designing them shelters inside billboards which pay for themselves through advertising revenue. Slovak Michal Polacek came up with the idea for the small roadside accommodation, complete with giant images and neon lights on the outside, for a programme called Project Gregory. Mr Polacek, and fellow designers Matej Nedorolik and Martin Lee Keniz, are seeking to raise £41,000 on Kickstarter to fund the first prototype home and test out their novel idea. Scroll down for video . Slovak architect Michal Polacek came up with the idea for the small roadside accommodation, complete with giant images and neon lights on the outside, as a novel way to get people off the streets in his home country . The design of the rectangular shaped homes is not just functional and allows for all the modern comforts . And all they ask is one pound from each donor to help turn their dream into a reality and help get people sleeping rough off the streets. Mr Polacek said: 'Through our campaign at Kickstarter people from all around the world can also contribute to the realization of Project Gregory. 'It is based on the same principle as when you give a piece of food or a coin to people without a home.' So far the team has yet to raise the bulk of the funds for their novel approach in getting the homeless a roof over their head, but it's early days and the online fundraiser still has 41 days left. And although they plan to start off their project in their home country of Slovakia, Mr Polacek believes their plan in thinking outside the box' has the potential to go global. The designers say the revenue from the advertising on the outside would cover all the maintenance costs . Mr Polacek and his team are looking to raise £41,000 on Kickstarter to build their first prototype shelter . 'When everyone who is interested in our idea will give us £1 we will be closer to help people without a home and soon Project Gregory can spread into other countries. 'Now is the best time to make big changes and everyone can participate.' The trio of designers want to give the homeless more than just a roof and four walls, however, and the living spaces would be smart and modern on the inside complete with plenty of home comforts. The billboard homes would maximise all the space inside the wooden-built shelters the designers planned . Mr Polacek and his designers are asking that each person give just £1 each to turn their dream into a reality . And to pay for the day-to-day maintenance costs and utility bills, the rectangular billboard homes would cover themselves through money brought in from renting the outside walls to advertisers. Mr Polacek said: 'If we take the electricity cost needed for the billboard to keep it lit at night and we try to optimize it by x%, we find this saved energy could fully cover all interior usage needs.' The novel billboard homes would be built with wooden joists set into a concrete base. For now, Mr Polacek and his team are hoping the public will pitch in for their Kickstarter campaign in their goal to raise £41,000 needed to get the novel shelter to the homeless off the ground.","Roadside shelters would come with giant ads and neon lights on outside .

"An American schooner missing for more than three weeks has failed to turn up during what officials have called the 'biggest search' ever conducted in the waters surrounding New Zealand. David Dyche, 58, was captaining Nina, a 70-foot yacht that Dyche, his wife, their son and four other crew members were sailing from New Zealand to Newcastle, Australia, when the historic vessel made contact with meteorologist Bob McDavitt asking how to get away from a storm on June 3. A message asking for further advice the next day was the last time anyone heard from the vessel. New Zealand Search and Rescue officer Neville Blakemore said his team turned up nothing in their extensive search for the schooner and that he has grave fears for the crew of the 85-year-old Nina. Captain: David Dyche was at the helm of the Nina when she disappeared three weeks ago . Without a trace: Rosemary Dyche told friends she was having 'the adventure of a lifetime' Trip of a lifetime: Rosemary and David Dyche's son, also named David, was traveling with his parents before starting university . Adventure: Captain David Dyche and Rosemary are both experienced sailors . 'The areas that have been searched . have been absolutely massive and the area searched is the biggest area . the Rescue Coordination Center of New Zealand has ever undertaken,' Blakemore told NBC News. 'The . comprehensive search by the Orion [aircraft] the last couple of days . has indicated that if the yacht was still afloat they would have seen it . in the search area. So we are assuming that it's not in the search area . and thus probably had a catastrophic event.' Dyche, his wife Rosemary, 60, and son David, 17, left Opua in the Bay of Islands in New Zealand aboard . the schooner on May 29. New Zealand meteorologist Bob . McDavitt says it was Nemeth who contacted him about the storm, asking, . 'The weather's turned nasty, how do we get away from it?' 'She was quite controlled in her . voice, it sounded like everything was under control,' McDavitt said, . adding that the call itself indicated she was concerned about the . conditions. Missing: Hope is fading for the seven people aboard the American schooner, Nina, which disappeared between New Zealand and Australia three weeks ago . Extensive search: Search and rescue workers scanned the waters all the way to the Australian coastline in their search for the missing yacht . Retired: Evi Nemeth is a retired Colorado University professor and computer engineer and the last member of the schooner's crew anyone has spoken to since June 4 . McDavitt said he spoke only briefly to Evi Nemeth, advising her to head south . and to brace for a storm with strong winds and high seas. The next day . he got a text, the last known communication from the boat: 'ANY UPDATE 4 . NINA? ... EVI' McDavitt said he advised the crew to . stay put and ride out the storm another day. He continued sending . messages the next few days but didn't hear back. Friends of the crew got . in touch with McDavitt soon after that, and alerted authorities on June 14. Blakemore didn't rule out the possibility of survivors but said the 'logical conclusion' is that the boat sank rapidly, preventing the crew from sending out an emergency SOS. He told NBC that the locator beacon onboard Nina was not activated by water pressure and wouldn’t start automatically if the boat sank. Sailing family: The Dyches had been sailing the Nina around the world for more than two years . Crew: A photo from David Dyche's Facebook page shows a young man who could be one of the missing crew members . Missing: A Facebook photo of a young woman aboard the Nina - it's not known if she's one of the missing crew members . Vanished: Maritime New Zealand called off its search in July, saying it had found no sign of the 70ft wooden vessel Nina . 'If the vessel got knocked over by a rogue wave it would have happened very, very quickly and they may not have had time to, to launch any life-saving equipment,' Blakemore said. Search and rescue teams are now looking for evidence of wreckage. Authorities say the storm three weeks . ago saw winds gusting up to 110 kilometers (68 miles) per hour and . waves of up to 8 meters (26 feet). Kevin . Banaghan, who is spearheading search efforts by Maritime New Zealand’s . Rescue Coordination Centre, said that on June 14, a communications . search began in which rescue workers tried contacting the boat over . various radio frequencies and by contacting other vessels in the area to . see if they’d seen the Nina. Missing: The boat left the Bay of Islands, pictured, in northern New Zealand on May 29. Authorities say the last communication was on June 4, when the Nina was about 370 nautical miles west of New Zealand . This week, he said, rescuers escalated their efforts. An Air Force plane Tuesday searched the area where the boat disappeared. A second search by the plane Wednesday went as far as the Australian coast but again turned up nothing. The team is now weighing up other search options. Rosemary Dyche has been documenting the family's travels on Facebook. At the beginning of the trip in 2011, she wrote:  'I am now on an adventure of a lifetime going around the world with my Wonderful husband who is my best friend and our youngest son.' 'But I do Miss my 2 older sons Justin and Kevin and my grand kids Katelynn and Sean my mom. And all my friends. But we have to do it now while we can.'","New .

"Despite a collection of seemingly racist rants about 'negros,' slavery and 'picking cotton,' not everyone thinks Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy is a racist, and one of the people defending the one-time far-right-wing folk hero is one of his bodyguards - who happens to be black. Jason Bullock has been at Bundy's side since his battle with the federal government began heating up in late March. According to Bullock, the man he's come to know over the last month is not a racist. In fact, Bullock says he would take a bullet for Bundy. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jason Bullock (left) says he would take a bullet for Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy (center) despite his recent racially insensitive rants . Not racist: Bullock says he is not offended by the comments Bundy has made and says he looks at him as a grandfather figure . Bullock was recently interviewed by CNN and asked, 'You're protecting this man and he's wondering whether African-Americans would be better off as slaves. How does that strike you?' 'It doesn't strike me any kind of way,' Bullock answered. 'This is still the same old Mr. Bundy I met from the first day of all this happening.' Bullock says the things Bundy has been saying - 'wondering' if 'negros' were better off under slavery, and comparing himself to civil rights hero Rosa Parks, for example - don't offend him. 'Mr. Bundy is not a racist. Ever since I've been here he's treated me with nothing but hospitality,' Bullock told the reporter. 'He's pretty much treated me like his own family.' He goes on to say that 'I would take a bullet for that man, if need be,' and that he 'look(s) up to him just like I do my grandfather.' The cause: Bullock says he believes in Bundy's cause, which is why he is willing to give his life to defend him . 'I believe in his cause and after having . met Mr. Bundy a few times, I have a really good feel about him and I'm a . pretty good judge of character,' Bullock said. However, Bundy's racist rants have led to public outcry and political allies distancing themselves - but Bundy doesn't see what all the fuss is about, claiming he is just like Rosa Parks and 'standing up against laws which destroy our freedom'. Bundy has become something of a celebrity in his frontier, Nevada stronghold since his showdown over cattle-grazing land with federal authorities earlier this month. He was quickly upheld as a hero by the right with Senator Rand Paul dubbing him a 'patriot'. However, that reputation is now in tatters after Bundy's series of racist rants - and it appears he just can't help fanning the flames with further remarks. On Friday, he invoked the heroic actions of Rosa Parks, the civil rights icon who was arrested in 1955 after refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man in Montgomery, Alabama. Her actions sparked the Montgomery bus boycott and were a defining moment of the civil rights' movement. Nevada Cattle rancher Cliven Bundy held up his boot today for the cameras as he said he 'didn't want to put his foot in his mouth with the boot on' following the uproar over his racist remarks . On the Bundy Ranch Facebook page on Friday, he wrote: 'I . am doing the same thing Rosa Parks did - I am standing up against bad . laws which dehumanize us and destroy our freedom. Just like the . Minutemen at Lexington and Concord, we are saying no to an oppressive . government which considers us to be slaves rather than free men. 'I . invite all people in America to join in our peaceful revolution to . regain our freedom. That is how America was started, and we need to keep . that tradition alive.' Bundy earlier said that if people were offended by his use of the word 'negro' or 'slave' then 'Martin Luther King hasn't got his job done yet'. The Conservative father of 14 told CNN: 'If I say Negro or black boy or slave, if those people cannot take those kind of words and not be (offended), then Martin Luther King hasn't got his job done yet....We need to get over this prejudice stuff.' Later in the rambling interview, he whipped off his cowboy boot and said: 'I didn't want to put my foot in my mouth with the boot on.' Officials had tried to round up Bundy's . cattle and evict him on April 12 after 20 years of not paying federal taxes. However they were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred . people, some of them armed with sniper rifles, turned up and threatened . to open fire. When asked by CNN host Bill Weir whether he was a 'welfare queen' on Thursday, Bundy responded: 'I might be a welfare queen. But I'll tell you I'm producing something for America and using a resource that nobody else would use or could use. I'm putting red meat on the table.' Bundy was forced to abandon his speeches about the 'overreaching' federal government on Thursday when his racist remarks emerged in a New York Times' article. Flanked by armed supporters, rancher Cliven Bundy speaks at a protest camp near Bunkerville, Nevada on April 18. He was adopted by the right as a hero but many public figures are now distancing themselves following his racist remarks . During his speech, Bundy shared a story of driving through a housing project in Las Vegas, according to a report by the New York Times, beginning his tale with the words: 'I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro.' He said: 'In front of that . government house the door was usually open and the older people and the . kids - and there is always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the . porch - they didn’t have nothing to do. They didn’t have nothing for . their kids to do. They didn’t have nothing for their young girls to do. 'And . because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they . do? They abort their young children, they put their young . men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I’ve . often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having . a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government . subsidy? They didn’t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.' Rancher Cliven Bundy (center with his arm around his granddaughter Jerusha) greets supporters during a Bundy family 'Patriot Party' near Bunkerville, Nevada, on April 18 . Mr Bundy, a 67-year-old father-of 14 and registered Republican, is . accused of not paying federal grazing taxes for his cattle for 20 . years, and reportedly owes the government $1million. A federal taskforce . has been setup to deal with him, Senate majority leader and Nevada Democrat Harry Reid said last week, branding Bundy a 'domestic terrorist'. Reid accused the militia supporting Reid of deliberately putting women and children into the firing line so that, in the event of violence, they got hurt first ensuring the worst possible headlines. Meanwhile Bundy has warned that he will never back down down from his fight. 'They will come, and I don't care,' he told MailOnline earlier this month. 'The people and citizens of America will win this fight. We have God on our side and we will be better prepared for them next time.' He said supporters from across the U.S., many of the armed a prepared to defend themselves, were heading for the remote town of Bunkersville, about 80 miles from Las Vegas in southern Nevada. He said: 'People have been mobilized by what they have seen and heard and they will come here because they see it as their right to defend the land.' Officials tried to round up Bundy's cattle and evict him on April 12 but were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred people, some of them armed, turned up and threatened to open fire . Bundy won the first round of his fight with agents from the Bureau of Land . Management after they released several hundred cows they had seized as . part of a long running dispute over grazing rights in Nevada. Craig Leff, from the Bureau of Land Management, told the Times: 'The gather is now over. Our focus is pursuing this matter . administratively and judicially.' Fears . of an armed confrontation with dozens of armed militia who had camped . out in a field leading to Bundy's ranch led federal officials to call . off their operation. Supporters . of Bundy hailed the decision as a victory - but the decision was taken . in part because Clark County Sheriff's feared violence could erupt at . any moment. Many . of the militia, who wore camouflage clothing and stalked the roads . around the Bundy home carrying automatic weapons,said they were prepared . to take on the federal agents in a fire fight. One was overheard boasting that he had two agent in his gun sight and could 'take them down'. The . dispute between Bundy and federal land managers began in 1993 when he . stopped paying monthly fees of about $1.35 per cow-calf pair to graze . public lands that are also home to imperiled animals such as the Mojave . Desert tortoise. Surrounding Bundy's ranch, one armed man (not pictured) was heard saying he had officials 'in his sights' during the heated stand-off earlier this month . Land managers limited the Bundy herd to just 150 head on a land which the rancher claims has been in his family for more than 140 years. The government also claims Bundy has ignored cancellation of his grazing leases and defied federal court orders to remove his cattle. Last week, they began an operation to seize his cattle prompting the stand off and mini invasion by militia members from California, Arizona, Montana and Utah to rush to his support. Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie was able to negotiate a resolution after talking with Bundy. It has not been revealed if Bundy would pay the estimated $1.2million he owes to the Government. The dispute that ultimately triggered the roundup dates to 1993, when the bureau cited concern for the federally protected tortoise in the region. The bureau revoked Bundy's grazing rights after he stopped paying grazing fees and disregarded federal court orders to remove his animals. The fight between Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management widened into a debate about states' rights and federal land-use policy.","Cattle rancher Cliven Bundy's black bodyguard, Jason Bullock, says he would take a bullet for him .

"Report: David Nicholson was in control of the strategic health authority responsible for supervising Stafford Hospital between 2005 and 2006 . As a young NHS trainee at the height of the Cold War, David Nicholson idolised Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. At the same time as starting work in a mental health unit he joined the Communist Party in 1977. He was no ordinary revolutionary. He was on the hardline, so-called ‘Tankie’ wing of the party which backed the Kremlin using military action to crush dissident uprisings. Today, David Nicholson is the £270,000-a year chief executive of the NHS. The one-time radical who used to regard political honours as elitist symbols of bourgeoisie government was happy to be knighted in 2010. Nicknamed the ‘Big Beast’ of the NHS because of his abrasive management style, his rise up the management ladder saw him take control of the strategic health authority responsible for supervising Stafford Hospital between 2005 and 2006. It was during this period that patients needlessly died because of appalling standards of care. Today’s damning report into the scandal could yet bring an end to his career – during which he forced through the last Labour government’s controversial ‘target culture’ that fatally undermined the ethos of care that has traditionally been a hallmark of NHS hospitals. It has been a remarkable journey for a man who was a Communist for six years until his membership lapsed in 1983. Critics say that the ‘uncaring culture’ that has developed in some aspects of healthcare can be likened to the one that prevailed during the godless Soviet regimes. But Nicholson, 57, won’t discuss his Communist past. The NHS chief was brought up in Nottingham – his father was crippled with emphysema and confined to a wheelchair. This tragic experience inculcated in his son the importance of the principle of an NHS free at the point of delivery. It’s not clear if he abandoned Communism to further his career, or because his views mellowed. But one thing is certain: Nicholson has always done his political masters’ bidding. As chief executive of Doncaster Royal Infirmary in the 1990s, when the Major government was in power, he was part of one of the first health trusts to break away from the control of Whitehall, amid fierce opposition from Labour and the unions. Beliefs: It is unclear whether Nicholson abandoned Communism because his views mellowed, or to further his career . Damning: The report into Mid Staffordshire Trust could bring an end to Nicholson's career . After a series of senior regional posts, in 2006 he became NHS chief executive under Prime Minister Tony Blair. Nicholson was expected to quit when the Tory-led Coalition came to power in 2010, but he was given additional responsibilities. However, his stewardship of the NHS since the election has been mired in controversy. He refused to cancel a major NHS IT project which became a monument to Whitehall folly when it was clear that costs were out of control. Eventually it was cancelled at a loss to the taxpayer of £12.7billion. Nicholson was appointed as NHS chief executive under Tony Blair, and David Cameron is the third prime minister he has served . Despite such a scandalous waste of money, Nicholson escaped blame and still enjoys the confidence of David Cameron (the third PM he’s served). Not all Tories, though, are so impressed. MP Steve Barclay, a member of the Commons Public Accounts committee, says:  ‘We had a major NHS IT programme that went spectacularly wrong. David Nicholson was the accounting officer. What scale of blunder do you have to make before you are held accountable for failure?’ Similar questions have been asked of his role in the Coalition’s botched Health Reform Bill. There were a series of anonymous and particularly poisonous briefings from within the Department of Health about the then Health Secretary Andrew Lansley’s handling of the legislation. In due course, the draft bill was postponed after it was deemed to be confused and overly complex. Nicholson remained in post while Lansley was replaced as Health Secretary. Within weeks, Nicholson was warning that ‘high-profile, politically-driven changes almost always end in misery and disaster’. These comments broke the Whitehall convention that civil servants criticise policy only in private, not in public. But Nicholson is a law unto himself. ‘No one crosses him. He’s like a ruthless omnipotent medieval Pope,’ said one senior official. Incidentally, relations between Nicholson and Lansley had never recovered after the minister spotted the civil service chief travelling first class by train to a conference when Lansley himself was going to the same meeting, but in second class. But then Nicholson loves travelling first class. On Saturday, the Mail disclosed that he racked up nearly £6,000 in 41 first-class train tickets in a year to Birmingham. Each time he claimed to have been ‘attending official meetings’ but, in fact, they were held via video-conferencing, meaning he could have taken part from anywhere in the country. MPs have indicated that they will ask Nicholson to justify the expenditure. Wife: Nicholson got engaged in 2009 to Sarah-Jane Marsh, the chief executive of Birmingham Children's Hospital . Many of the trips spanned ‘long weekends’, prompting speculation he was going to his see his new young wife at their home in Birmingham. Divorced with two grown-up sons, Nicholson had earlier got engaged in 2009 to Sarah-Jane Marsh, the chief executive of Birmingham Children’s Hospital. It was not just the 22-year age gap which caused consternation. It was also the fact Nicholson met her while she was seconded to his office as a junior. Nicholson has told NHS trusts to deliver between £15billion and £20billion in efficiency savings before 2014 . Nicholson, then director of Health and Social Care for the Midlands and East of England, took a shine to the attractive graduate trainee, acting as her mentor. He also gave her two job references – the second leading to her appointment as chief operating officer at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. She was in the job when the Health Care Commission delivered a devastating report over a catalogue of patient failures at the hospital. Two years later, despite the criticism, she became chief executive on a £155,000 salary, at the relatively youthful age of 32. By this time she was engaged to Nicholson – the all-powerful head of the NHS. For his part, Nicholson has told NHS trusts to deliver between £15billion and £20billion in efficiency savings before 2014 (the equivalent of to up to 6 per cent of the current NHS budget). Meanwhile, his own personal spending included £155,000 worth of expenses in four years. His annual expenses for his plush London flat was triple the MPs’ second homes allowance. He gave up the property on condition that taxpayers covered any hotel bills incurred and despite the fact he chose to live in Birmingham. He also has a chauffeur-driven car. How ironic if this former Communist party member’s downfall was triggered not by the tragic effects of the ‘target culture’ he ruthlessly enforced which contributed to the fiasco at Stafford, but if he was censured by a committee of MPs for using taxpayers’ money on his lavish expenses.","David Nicholson idolised Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev as trainee .

"The medical director of the post-deployment clinic at the scandal-plagued Veterans Affairs hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, says that injured combat veterans from conflicts in both Iraq and Afghanistan have been forced to wait months to be seen by healthcare professionals despite the fact that there is a national directive that requires they be given priority access to medical treatment at VA hospitals. Dr. Katherine Mitchell says that up until about three weeks ago - when the problems at the Phoenix VA began to come to light - didn't honor the national mandate giving priority scheduling for medical treatment for injured vets. According to Mitchell, injured vets sometimes had to wait months to be seen. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Whistleblower: Dr. Katherine Mitchell says she witnessed dishonest scheduling practices at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs hospital . 'People that are 100 percent service . connected that are polytrauma were waiting anywhere from six to 10 . months to get into a new appointment when I found out about 'em,' she . said during an interview on CNN's AC 360. Recent . revelations blame shoddy management for the deaths of dozens of former . soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, as administrators in Phoenix – . and possibly elsewhere – maintained a secret off-the-books waiting list . for veterans in need of critical care. Official . lists were kept short so the agency could appear to be doing its job . despite some waits being more than a year long. In one case, a Phoenix . official was awarded bonuses based on fraudulent statistics as veterans . died waiting for medical care. 'We . have been working continuously to try and identify where those sites . are and what we need to do to prevent that from happening. It's . absolutely inexcusable,' Veterans Affairs Undersecretary Robert Petzel told lawmakers last week. Scandal: The VA hospital in Phoenix faces allegations that 40 veterans died as a result of treatment delays . 'The individuals are ... held accountable,' he insisted, while admitting that  'I can't give you an example specifically.' 'But if someone were found to be manipulating inappropriately the scheduling system, they would be disciplined.' Veterans Affairs Secretary . Eric Shinseki requested and received Petzel's resignation but has . steadfastly insisted upon staying put himself, despite calls from . prominent Republicans and Democrats for his ouster. White . House Press Secretary Jay Carney released an approving statement about Petzl's resignation, which was announced just an hour . after his final daily press briefing of the week concluded. 'The . president supports Secretary Shinseki’s decision,' Carney said, adding . that President Obama 'has asked Secretary Shinseki to conduct a review . of Veterans Health Administration practices and procedures at its . facilities nationwide to ensure better access to care, and that review . is ongoing.' Veterans Affairs Undersecretary for Health Dr. Robert Petzel has resigned just a day after testifying in a contentious Senate hearing about a VA health care scandal tied to as many as 40 deaths . Focus: Millions of military veterans depend on VA hospitals and clinics for acute and long-term medical care, and the system has been rife with wait-list problems for years . 'The president and Secretary Shinseki take the allegations around misconduct very seriously,' he added. Shinseki . said in a statement that 'most veterans are satisfied with the quality . of their VA health care, but we must do more to improve timely access to . that care.' Mitchell . told CNN that there were instances at the Phoenix clinic that case . managers and patient advocates told superiors, 'This guy can't wait. Can . you see him?' 'We're talking about people that . were injured by being blown up by IEDs. We're talking about people who . had a mental breakdown and have severe PTSD and ...are having trouble . functioning,' she said. Next to go? Petzel (R) is out, but VA Secretary Gen. Eric Shinseki (C) is refusing to resign . Mitchell says she reported the issues to the VA's Office of the Inspector General. The . doctor believes the problem at the VA is a lack of medical . professionals to care for the large number of veterans their supposed to . care for. She says this is the result of low pay, slow hiring practices . and not enough qualified professionals applying to work at the VA. 'As a result, you've got a lot of . patients and not enough providers,' she said. 'It's not just Phoenix VA. It's across the country, which is why everyone is hiding a backlog.' On . Wednesday, the House of Representatives approved a bill to give the . Veterans Affairs secretary more authority to fire or demote senior . executives at the agency. The . bill is in direct response to the growing furor over allegations of . treatment delays and preventable deaths at VA hospitals. According . to the department's inspector general, 26 facilities are being . investigated nationwide, including the Phoenix hospital, which is facing . allegations that 40 people died while waiting for treatment. Standing guard: Members of the American Legion have attended hearings and applied pressure throughout the VA scandal, demanding Shinseki's resignation at every turn . Republican . Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida said VA officials who have presided over . mismanagement or negligence are more likely to receive bonuses or . glowing performance reviews than any sort of punishment. The bill was approved Wednesday, and now goes to the Senate. The . White House says it supports the goal of seeking greater accountability . at the VA but has unspecified concerns about the legislation. President Obama has vowed to hold anyone who falsified records at VA hospitals accountable. He also said that he is sending his deputy chief of staff, Rob Nabors, . to Phoenix on Wednesday to visit the facility. Mitchell . says she didn't personally have any patients die as a result of the . dishonest scheduling practices, but she says she was aware of a trend of . suicides amongst combat vets. 'These guys who committed suicide, who . were successful suicide completions, would have benefited from more . intense mental health treatment,' she said. 'And those appointments . weren't available.'","Dr. Katherine Mitchell says the delays happened until about three weeks ago, when problems at the Phoenix VA came to light .

Mitchell says that she is aware of a pattern of suicides that could have been prevented with better mental health services at the VA ."
"The former head of psychiatry at a Veterans Affairs hospital system in Missouri says he was demoted after he tried to get doctors in his department to see veterans more quickly. Dr. Jose Matthews told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that after discovering some of his colleagues were creating an 'artificial backlog' of veterans who needed care by seeing half as many patients as they could, he filed a federal whistleblower complaint and tried to change hospital culture. Then, one day, the hospital removed him from his position and sent him to the basement to process disability claims. Matthews says he has faced unfair treatment from the hospital and harassment from some of his coworkers for simply doing his job and trying to get veterans care in a timely manner. 'They’re sometimes mocking,' he told CBS St. Louis. 'There are sometimes people who make it a point to come into my office and laugh. Seriously, this is not a joke.' Dr. Jose Mathews, the former chief of psychiatry at the VA hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, claims he was demoted because of a staff 'mutiny' following his efforts to make employees work harder and more efficiently . Matthews says he filed a whistle blower complaint after he discovered colleagues were creating an 'artificial backlog' of veterans who needed care by seeing half as many patients as they could . Veterans sometimes wait a month or longer for mental health treatment at this St. Louis VA hospital because of some doctors' lazy work load, Mathews claims. 'No one is working even close to a reasonable day's work' Matthews became chief of psychiatry at the VA St. Louis Health Care System in St. Louis, Missouri, from November 2012. He says he spent nine months trying to get his colleagues to increase their workload before he was demoted and was semi-successful. When he arrived, doctors in his department were seeing only six patients a day, when they should being seeing 12, he told reporters. 'No one is working even close to a reasonable day’s work,' Mathews told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 'It seems like that’s the norm here, and everyone seems to be OK . with it except the veterans.' Veterans sometimes waited a month or more to be seen because of colleagues' lackadaisical attitude toward providing veterans with efficient care. By the time he was shipped out of his office and into the basement, his colleagues were seeing nine patients a day, but it's still not enough, he says. 'We take these allegations seriously,' hospital spokeswoman Marcena Gunter said in a statement after Matthews went to the press with his story. 'The St. Louis VA Medical Center leadership is aware of and is . addressing the alleged issues,' she said. Missouri Senators Roy Blunt and Claire McCaskill have already sent a letter to Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki asking the VA to reveal the exact number of psychiatric patients the St. Louis hospital system is seeing per day and what the hospitals are doing to reduce appointment wait times. If Matthews' claims are true, they 'would demonstrate an unacceptable lack of leadership at the . VA in St. Louis that is putting the health and safety of veterans at . risk,' the Senators told Shinseki. Mismanagement of veterans care at the St. Louis VA hospital is among one of several complaints lodged at VA officials this month. Reports that employees at a Phoenix, Arizona, VA facility created secret waiting lists that potentially contributed to the deaths of 40 veterans has rocked the Obama administration. 'This is a growing list of problems that our veterans should not have to deal with, that Congress should not in any way let these issues go uninvestigated,' Missouri Senator Blunt said of the St. Louis controversy in a statement to reporters . Senator Roy Blunt, pictured here in April meeting with military officials at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, has been a vocal advocate for changes to military mental health policies . 'This is a growing list of problems that our veterans should not have to deal with, that Congress should not in any way let these issues go uninvestigated,' Blunt said of the St. Louis controversy in a statement to reporters. Blunt said Shinseki should investigate the allegation. If he won't sanction an investigation, Blunt said, 'somebody else' should. The American Legion has called for Shinseki to step down amid the . controversy, and the White House forced the VA's Under Secretary for . Health Robert Petzel to step down even though he was already set to . retire this year. The VA is doing an internal review of its hospitals practices in conjunction with the White House in light of recent allegations. The VA Inspector General's office is doing its own review and expects to conclude its work in August. Problems with poor care at VA hospitals goes back years, however, a report on Monday concluded, and previous complaints and investigations have done little to make the government to act.","The former head of psychiatry at the VA hospital system in St. Louis, Missouri says he was demoted after .

"Moving hologram displays like those featured in Star Wars could soon be available to watch on a laptop. Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have cracked a major technological hurdle to make low-cost, high quality holographic videos a reality. Until now, the video hologram has generally been confined to science fiction, the most famous example being the projected image of Princess Leia in the first Star Wars film. Unlike a 3D image, a holographic projection allows the viewer to move around and get different perspectives from all angles . Scientists have cracked a major technological hurdle to make low-cost, high quality holographic videos a reality. This hologram was made by Chris Levine . Existing systems that project moving holographic images are costly and suffer from severe limitations. The chief problem lies with devices called spatial light modulators, which direct light to form points in three dimensional space. With current technology, key elements of display size, viewing angle, frame rate and depth of image are restricted. The U.S. engineers have developed a new kind of spatial light modulator that overcomes most of these problems. The research, published in the journal Nature, promises to take the holographic video out of the realms of science fiction and into the real world. Scientists estimate that a holographic monitor using the technology could be built for less than £320 ($500USD), excluding light sources. The team, led by Dr Michael Bove, wrote in Nature: 'We are now exploring displays based on arrays of these devices such as a small PC-driven, holographic video monitor and large-scale displays exceeding half a metre in width driven by dedicated hardware. 'It is now possible... to make holographic video monitors with full-colour, standard video resolution and a 30Hz (hertz) refresh rate.'

"A 20-year-old woman was gang-raped, killed and hanged from a tree in Pakistan in a case that bears a chilling resemblance to a double rape and murder that caused outrage in neighbouring India last month. Pakistani police said Muzammil Bibi was attacked by three men in a field in the impoverished Layyah area of densely populated Punjab province. Senior officer Sadaqat Ali Chohan said: 'This is the first time in my 22 years of service in the police that I have seen such a case, where a girl was raped in this way and found hanging from a tree. WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES . Horrific: A policeman stands near the body of Muzammil Bibi, 20, after policemen lowered her to the ground. She was found hanging from a tree in the town of Nawan Kot, located in Pakistan's Punjab province . 'We have heard of such cases in India but never in Pakistan. The girl's clothes were torn. We took her down and moved her to hospital. 'Her body had signs of resistance. We have arrested three individuals who have confessed to the crime.' According to police, the 20-year-old resisted the rape and her attackers strangled her. Police said her parents spent all night looking for her and found her body hanging the next morning. In a shockingly similar crime which took place in May, two teenage cousins were found hanging from a tree after being raped in the north of India. WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGE: In May, two teenage cousins were found hanging from a tree, pictured, after being raped in the north of India . Three men have been arrested over the killings.

The controversial remarks came as . political leaders of Uttar Pradesh - the state where the two cousins aged 12 . and 14 were raped and hanged - faced criticism for . failing to visit the scene. Another . regional politician from Modi's party, the Bharatiya Janata Party . (BJP), said the crime of rape could only be considered to . have been committed if it is reported to police. In yet another incident earlier this month, another woman, who was just 19 years old was also found dead hanging from a tree in India - becoming the fourth . woman from the same state to die in this way.

"Todd Chrisley's son has sensationally claimed his father is gay, but is hiding the truth from his family. The father-of-five's sexuality has long been the subject of speculation and several times he has been forced to publicly deny he is gay. But his son, Kyle, 23, who is now estranged from him, says he believes the 46-year-old star of Chrisley Knows Best is lying. Scroll down for video . Claims: Todd Chrisley's son Kyle, (left) has claimed his father is gay (right) and even said he suspects he is fooling around with a local doctor . Now you see him: Kyle was on the first season of Chrisley Knows best, but he's been kicked off the show . Kyle, who has well-documented problems with drugs, but claims he is now clean, told InTouch magazine: 'I think my father is gay.' He said he suspects his father is fooling around with a local doctor - InTouch did not reveal their name. 'I used to work with him at Chrisley Asset Management. Denial: His first wife Teresa Terry says she does not think her ex-husband is gay . 'If one of the asset managers was going to take a p***, he would say, ""You want me to come hold it for you?"" 'It makes you wonder. It's time the truth comes out,' he said. The 46-year-old's first wife, Teresa Terry, also recently addressed the claims in an interview with MailOnline. Smiling she admitted: 'I know there are reports saying that he's gay and I can see why. 'But I married him and I had two children with him so obviously I don't think he's gay. 'If he comes out of the closet in the second season I'll be shocked.' With his camp demeanor, acid tongue and relentlessly pristine appearance the self-styled Patriarch of Perfection's is constantly plagued by rumors of his sexuality. He is married to wife Julie, 41, and has five children – Lindsie, 24, Kyle, 23, Chase,17, Savannah,16 and Grayson, 7. But Kyle also has an explanation about why his father's second wife has stayed in the marriage for 18 years. 'If the money wasn't there, she would have been gone a long time ago,' he insisted. Chrisley does make persistent references to the speculation in the hit show. 'I'd rather be a gay pop icon than a redneck,' Chrisley said in an episode earlier this year. But only a few weeks ago Chrisley told InTouch: 'I am not gay, nor have I ever been.' Kyle also has an explanation about why his father's second wife Julie, 41,  has stayed in the marriage for 18 years. 'If the money wasn't there, she would have been gone a long time ago,' he insisted . 'I've never cared what others say about my sexuality,' he said. 'I'd much rather you think I'm getting laid versus not getting laid!' In an interview with People he spoke about when a man tweeted him asking 'When are you going to come out of the closet?' 'I said, ""I don't live in a closet, but if you'd like me to escort you out of yours I'm happy to do so."" 'All of a sudden the Tweet went away and he took it down because I flipped the script on him,' he said. It is not the first time Kyle has verbally attacked his father - the pair are currently in a bitter custody battle over Kyle's two-year-old daughter Chloe. Passion for fashion: Chrisley says that his family spends more than $300,000 a year on clothes - here he is pictured in his large closet . Eye for detail: The father-of-five likes to organize all of his outfits 'by season' In an exclusive interview with MailOnline last month, Kyle blasted Chrisley's 'fairy-tale' existence as a sham, dismissed the show as a fake and described his father as bankrupt, toxic and a snake. 'This show has been nothing but bad for me. 'At this point he's ruined me and he's ruined the other three kids he's had who are spoiled,' he said. Kyle said, 'The whole thing is fake. He micromanages everything so if you say something and he doesn't like it he'll say, 'Stop' and tell you what to say and you'll do it again.' Chrisley's rep told InTouch he is 'not concentrating on the words Kyle is saying, but rather concentrating on getting Kyle the necessary psychiatric care he so desperately needs.'","Todd Chrisley's sexuality has long been the subject of speculation .

"Greater Manchester has a new listed building – a brick shed in a grandmother’s back yard that was once used by ‘mad hatters’. The outhouse in a terrace street in Denton has been given Grade II listed status by English Heritage, placing it on a par with other local treasures including Manchester’s Central Library and Free Trade Hall. The shed, bought by pensioner Lillian Robinson and her late husband, Maurice, for a three-figure sum in the 1980s, is believed to be the only known surviving example of a largely intact, two-storey planking shop and bow garret – a workshop used by Denton’s prosperous hatting industry in the 19th century. Greater Manchester's newest listed building is a brick shed in a grandmother's back yard. It's at 66a Market Street and is believed to be the bow garret of William Turner, a hatter who lived at nearby Hope Cottage on South Street, now Stockport Road . It has been listed by conservation experts after MP Andrew Gwynne and local historians uncovered its history. Mrs Robinson, 74, a lollipop lady, said: ‘I’ve not been into history before but I am now. It’s quite exciting to know that you’ve got something like that in your back garden when you thought it was just an ordinary shed. ‘I knew nothing of it until Andrew came knocking on my door last year with a historian and asked to have a look. I had to rush off but obviously I trusted him so I gave him the key to my house and told him to lock it when he left. When I returned three hours later from my shift, they were still there. Pensioner Lilian Robinson was surprised to discover that the shed where she stored her late husband's tools and lawn mower was actually a rare example of a shop where hatters plied their trade . Store room: Pensioner Lillian Robinson uses the building as a place to keep her husband's old tools . 'I had no idea of the shed's history. My late husband Maurice and I only used the shed to put his tools in. He used to joke that he was going to convert it into a granny flat for me one day. We had already owned the house for around 30 years when we enquired about the shed in the 1980s. We bought it for a couple of hundred quid from a man who lived nearby. There was only a big table in there and it was very dusty and we had no idea of its significance.' The building at 66a Market Street is believed to be the bow garret of William Turner, a hatter who lived at nearby Hope Cottage on South Street, now Stockport Road. The bowing process, which involved the cleaning of the fur, would have taken place upstairs where the light was better. The planking process would have been carried out on the ground floor of the two-storey shed. It involved fur hoods being stripped from the animal and boiled in a kettle of water before being dried - but the process used an orange-coloured liquid that gave off toxic mercury fumes – triggering the term ‘mad hatter’. Grandmother Mrs Robinson added: ‘The shed has had its fair share of wear and tear. Two years ago a group of pigeons managed to get in and made a right mess doing their business all over the floor. ‘We had to smash one of the windows just to get them all out and we have boarded it up. ‘Mr Gwynne told me that the alley just next to the shed is where the horse and carriage would park up and make it's deliveries, it really is fantastic to be part of history, I never want to sell it now.’ Historian Margaret Smethurst searched in dusty archives for the documentation showing that lollipop lady Lillian Robinson was the owner of a building that was once at the centre of the hatting industry . Historian Margaret Smethurst said: ‘I’d seen the building and thought that’s what it probably was so I looked for the earliest records I could find and saw a structure on the 1841 Ordinance Survey map near to Hope Cottage. ‘I looked at the census and saw that a journeyman hatter lived there with apprentices and his family, so that indicated it was a working place and allowed me to make the link with the outhouse at Market Street which has all the features of a bow garret.’ 'It is the last surviving evidence of a major industry and is incredibly important for our nation’s history’                     Nick Brigland, English Heritage . At its peak, Denton and neighbouring Stockport were the centre of Britain’s hatting industry. By 1840, thousands of felt hats were being produced each week. Denton became known for better quality hats made from beaver and rabbit fur, which would have been processed in Mrs Robinson’s bow garret. Nick Bridgland, of English Heritage, said: ‘It is the last surviving evidence of a major industry and is incredibly important for our nation’s history.’ Mr Gwynne said: ‘I’m grateful to English Heritage for recognising just how important this small building is.’ In the days before modern machinery eliminated the need for felt hats to be made by hand, an occupational hazard was to be sent mad. The reason was that hatters were exposed to chronic mercury poisoning because of prolonged . The Mad Hatter from Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland . exposure to the mercury vapours caused by the method of felting work. To get felt for hats animals had to be separated from their pelts and the hatters used an orange-coloured solution containing mercuric nitrate as a smoothing agent to remove the skins and stick them together. The resulting felt was then shaped into large cones, shrunk in boiling water and dried.Hatters worked in confined areas and as the felt dried it gave off volatile vapours. Prolonged exposure could cause mental confusion, emotional disturbances, and muscular weakness. Hatters could also suffer nerve and kidney damage as well as red fingers, toes and cheeks and lose their hearing, hair, teeth and nails as well excessive sweating and bleeding from the ears and mouth. They also became shy and irritable. Eventually, governments stepped in and in 1898, legislation was passed in France to protect hatters from the risks of mercury exposure. By the turn of the 20th century, mercury poisoning among British hatters had become a rarity. On July 4, 1862 the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and the Reverend Robinson Duckworth took a five-mile boat trip on the Isis in Oxford with three young girls – Lorina, 13, Alice, 10, and Edith, 8 – the daughters of Henry Liddell, the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University and Dean of Christ Church. On the trip the Reverend Mr Dodgson told them the story of a girl named Alice who was after an adventure. The girls loved it and Alice Liddell asked him to write the story down for her. The story became Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland and the Reverend Mr Dodgson published it under the nom de plume Lewis Carroll. As well as Alice, the book contained a panoply of marvellous characters including the Mad Hatter (who held a tea party), the Queen of Hearts, White Rabbit, a Gryphon and a Mock Turtle.","19th century shed now listed among Manchester architectural treasures including Free Trade Hall and Central Library .

"Britain will not impose sanctions or support military action against Russia, according to a briefing paper that was revealed in error yesterday. The document became public when one of David Cameron’s advisers left it on display to press photographers before a Downing Street meeting. The blunder by Hugh Powell, who is deputy national security adviser, also shows that the Government has no plans to freeze Russian investors out of the City of London. A document (pictured) that stated Britain will not impose sanctions on Russia or support military action was revealed by accident . The document was revealed by deputy national security adviser Hugh Powell to photographers as he walked past No10 to attend a meeting about the crisis in Ukraine . Instead, the briefing paper recommends that the UN should take the lead and possibly send monitors to Ukraine. The document says: ‘UK should not support for now, trade sanctions ... or close London’s financial centre to Russians.’ It also says that Britain should ‘discourage any discussions (eg at Nato) of emergency military preparations’. Downing Street sources confirmed that the briefing document is official policy. The leaked document reveals details of the UK’s plans for raising pressure on Russia. Several key elements will interest the Kremlin: . WHAT IT SAYS The papers show plans to break off relations with Russia through a series of international organisations.

Effective ruling out of support for military action. Ministers fear that imposing trade restrictions or somehow excluding Russians from the financial markets in London will hurt economic growth and deter foreign investment. The capital is known as ‘Londongrad’ due to the number of millionaire Russian oligarchs based here. A senior figure said: ‘We’re trying to find ways of hurting Russia, not hurting ourselves.’ Mr Powell, who was at Eton with the . Prime Minister, is the son of Margaret Thatcher’s chief foreign policy . adviser Charles Powell and nephew of Tony Blair’s chief of staff . Jonathan Powell. The document undermined claims by Mr Cameron and William Hague that the UK was set to get tough with Russia. Visiting . the Ukrainian capital Kiev, the Foreign Secretary described the . situation as the biggest crisis in Europe in the 21st century. David Cameron and William Hague - pictured meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minsiter Arseniy Yatsenyuk today - claimed the UK was set to get tough with Russia . He warned Russian president Vladimir Putin that he faces a ‘significant cost’ for taking control of the Ukrainian region. After chairing the National Security Council meeting, Mr Cameron said a clear message needed to be ‘sent to the Russian government that continuing down this path of violating the sovereignty of another country will have costs and consequences’. He added: ‘We shall have to bring to bear diplomatic, political, economic and other pressures.’ US secretary of state John Kerry  threatened to deny Russians in America access to their money today . By contrast, US secretary of state John Kerry went much further, threatening to deny Russians in America access to their money. He said Mr Putin ‘may find himself with asset freezes on Russian business. American business may pull back, there may be a further tumble of the rouble’. Last night EU foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels, agreed to suspend cooperation with Russia over the planned G8 summit in Mr Putin’s holiday home of Sochi in June. The EU will also suspend cooperation on visas and they warned that ‘further sanctions’ may be imposed after an emergency summit on Thursday. A Downing Street spokesman refused to discuss the leak. ‘We never comment on security matters,’ he said. Labour MP Simon Danczuk called for Mr Powell to resign, pointing out that Bob Quick – the former Scotland Yard head of counter-terrorism – was forced to quit in 2009 after a similar mistake. He said: ‘It’s astonishing that the deputy national security adviser can’t keep sensitive documents like this private. It’s clearly a serious issue and needs to be addressed.’ Tory MP Douglas Carswell added: ‘I’m surprised to hear that Inspector Clouseau is working in Downing Street. We have literally shown all our cards.’ One Government official indicated that a reprimand was on the cards for Mr Powell.","Cameron's adviser Hugh Powell left file on display to photographers .

"Moscow sold £6billion gold and foreign currency to protect the rouble . Wholesale gas prices rose the most in two years yesterday as markets reacted to the crisis in Ukraine. Fears that supplies to western Europe could be affected saw the price surge by 10 per cent at one point. The cost of crude oil also rose – driven by fears that Russia, which is a major producer, might be hit by trade sanctions. The turmoil spilled over into stockmarkets, with big falls in share prices in London and New York. Scroll down for video . The cost of crude oil - a plant in Tuapse, Russia, pictured - and gas increased today following fears the country might be hit by trade sanctions . This morning a Kremlin aide said that if the United States were to impose sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, Moscow might be forced to drop the dollar as a reserve currency and refuse to pay off loans to U.S. banks. Sergei Glazyev, an adviser to the Kremlin who is often used by the authorities to stake out a hardline stance but does not make policy, added that if Washington froze the accounts of Russian businesses and individuals, Moscow would recommend that all holders of U.S. treasuries sell them. The statement comes as the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee admitted it is preparing legislation to provide support to Ukraine, and consulting the Obama administration on possible sanctions against individual Russians - ranging from visa bans and asset freezes to suspending military cooperation and sales, as well as economic sanctions. Moscow has been forced to sell off gold and foreign currency worth £6billion to try to protect the sliding value of the rouble. The . threat from Kremlin Aide Sergei Glazyev that Russia could sell all its . US Treasuries, drop the dollar as a reserve currency and default on . loans from the US is an idle one according to analyst Mark Oswald at . Monument Securites. ‘It would be a declaration of economic war - and it would hurt Russia a lot more than the US. 'Russia’s . main exports are oil and gas, which are traded in dollars and which . means Russia receives constant huge inflows of dollars. ‘Russia . would have to find A buyer for what is probably in the region of . $100billion in US Treasuries, which, if not impossible, would in any . case mean they would get a terrible deal. By defaulting on loans their . access to funding globally would be cut off. ‘In . the unlikely hypothetical event the threat was carried through, the . main impact would be upward pressure on long-term US interest rates – . but it is likely that the Federal Reserve could take steps to counter . that. There would be passing disruption for the US and world markets but . lasting damage to Russia itself.’ Russia’s central bank raised its key interest rate from 5.5 per cent to 7 per cent to try to stop investors taking their money out of the country. The £34billion tumble in the value of shares on the biggest Russian stock exchange, the MICEX, was greater than the cost of hosting and running the Winter Olympics last month. Andrei Klepach, Russia’s deputy . economy minister, described the reaction of the financial markets as . ‘hysteria’, which would subside in the coming days. Meanwhile, Moscow seemed to be initiating economic sanctions against the Ukraine, with Russia's top gas producer Gazprom announcing it will remove a discount on gas prices for Ukraine from April . Motorists were warned of potential fuel price rises as speculators bought up stocks to capitalise on the political uncertainty. An RAC spokesman said: ‘Fuel traders . have already begun to buy up stocks to guard against being caught out in . the event of the situation worsening, which automatically causes prices . to increase due to a tightening in supply. ‘And, . to make matters worse, the price of oil will almost certainly be . negatively affected, further increasing fuel costs and, in turn, . forecourt prices.’ Luke . Bosdet, a spokesman for the AA, said: ‘Experience from previous crises . shows that commodity market speculation tends to be a greater problem . than the actual threat to supply. Over recent weeks, reduced oil flow . from Libya has put upward pressure on the price of oil yet it has had . little impact on the UK pump price. This is primarily due to the . strength of the pound. Menacing pro-Russian activists take to the streets in Odessa yesterday, many of whom were waving weapons . ‘The average price of petrol is 10p a litre lower than a year ago, when it peaked at 140p a litre. Now it is still below 130p. The $2-a-barrel rise in today’s Brent oil price represents a possible 1p rise in the pump price of petrol, but only if sustained.’ Gas from Russia, some of which is exported through pipelines that run across Ukraine, makes up around 25 per cent of supplies to the Continent’s homes and businesses. Masked and wielding makeshift weapons, a crowd of around 3,000 pro-Russian activists led a demonstration in the Ukrainian port of Odessa yesterday.Members of the group managed to break into a session of the local parliament, smashing windows and injuring an official, according to local reports.Congregating outside the building, activists in balaclavas and helmets, waved Russian flags and wooden clubs with screws in and chanted ‘referendum’.Police had to move in to after dozens of young people from the far-right Pravy Sektor arrived on the scene demanding that the pro-Russian demonstrators leave and remove a Russian flag that had been placed on the building.In the eastern city of Donetsk, around 100 pro-Russian protesters seized two floors of a regional government building after the self-imposed Kiev government appointed a local oligarch as  a regional governor. It is feared that Moscow will use its control over the supply as economic leverage to head off opposition to its decision to send troops in to Crimea. It supplies gas to Ukraine at a deep discount – a concession it warns will end in April. This could affect supplies to other countries if Ukraine decides to grab gas from the Russian pipelines crossing its territory. It used this tactic during a dispute in 2009 and prices rose sharply. Russia does not supply gas directly to the UK, however any increase in international wholesale prices will feed through to customers here. Analysts point out that Western Europe is less reliant on Russian gas than before. The unusually mild winter means that the UK has 25 per cent more in storage than normal. At the same time, European nations have spent billions on wind power with the result that many gas-fired power stations have been mothballed. And strong westerly winds have allowed UK windfarms to consistently produce more than 10 per cent of the country’s electricity in recent weeks. The wholesale cost of gas had been falling for three weeks and – despite the Ukraine crisis – it is still below the level of February 2012. Joe Conlan, an energy trader at Inenco, said: ‘Gas prices remain volatile and are closely linked to the power price – further price rises may be seen. ‘The situation could be worse but, with Europe having had a mild winter, prices have fallen significantly of late. However, this morning’s rise has eradicated three weeks of constant falls. Riot police outside the government building targeted by the protesters in Odessa . ‘Should this continue, prices are likely to carry on rising in the medium term.’ UK gas prices rose as high as 61.95p a therm – up 9.4 per cent – at one stage before falling back to around 60p a therm. The events in Russia will be watched with particular concern by the British energy giant BP. Last year it ended a troubled partnership with Russian oligarchs and decided to get into bed with the Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft, where it owns 20 per cent of the shares. Sanctions imposed against Russia could directly impact BP and its desire to be the partner of the Kremlin in exploiting oil and gas reserves in  Siberia and the Arctic.","Fears supplies to western Europe could be affected by crisis in Ukraine .

"Critics on both sides of the Atlantic have been getting their hand-wrapping in a twist over Bernard Hopkins, at the grand old age of 49, fighting one of boxing’s hardest and most devastating punchers. Krusher Kovalev is too much of a health risk for the most venerable gentleman of the ring, they cry. They protested just the same only four months ago, before Hopkins defeated Beibut Shumenov to unify the IBF and WBA world light-heavyweight titles. Champion: Hopkins' diet, work-out regime and Spartan lifestyle have helped him carry on boxing for so long . Support: Hopkins celebrates victory over Shumenov following their WBA & IBA light-heavyweight title fight . Again, Hopkins replies: ‘Age is but a number.’ So it is and that number keeps rising in all sports as medical science, high-tech training methods and social sacrifices enable more and more athletes to prolong their careers. In the case of Hopkins, his dedication to diet, his work-out regime and a Spartan lifestyle are of a devout religious order. Never mind the birth certificate, examine the physical specimen. Hopkins has changed his nickname from The Executioner to The Alien and really is an out-of-this-world phenomenon. By appearance, certainly in the physique, Hopkins looks about the same age as Floyd Mayweather, who is super-fit at 37 and as such the best pound-for-pound fighter on this planet. The best: Hopkins looks about the same age as Floyd Mayweather, left, despite being 12 years older . Youthful smile: Mayweather is arguably the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world . Hopkins is a profoundly intelligent boxer and a highly articulate advocate for his sport. There are no signs of wear and tear from his 65 fights spanning 28 years, the majority of them against other world-class operators in middleweight and light-heavy title fights. Yet again, he has no hesitation in agreeing to take on the most dangerous of opponents. Negotiations to face Sergey Kovalev began last Thursday and were finalised on Friday, 24 hours before the Russian sealed his end of the deal by defending his WBO title with a three knock-down, second round flattening of previously undefeated challenger Blake Caparello. Hopkins and Kovalev will come to blows this November, either in Atlantic City or at the state-of-the-art Barclays Centre in New York. And while the commentators are voicing fears for the well-being of Hopkins, many good judges in the boxing fraternity are declining to write him off. Lou diBella, promoter of Caparello, observed after watching his man crushed: ‘Kovalev has dynamite in his fists but Hopkins is such a clever and cagey boxer that he definitely has a chance.’ Intimidating: Critics fear that Kovalev, left, will destroy Hopkins in a similar manner to his win over Cleverly, right . Nor has he ever been knocked out, although Kovalev’s own promoter, Kathy Duva, says: ‘We expect Sergey to be the first to do that.’ Hopkins reassures those worried for him by saying: ‘I have every intention of becoming the undisputed world light-heavyweight champion.’ In that pursuit he has turned to Kovalev after perceiving what he believes to be the reluctance of another big-hitting champion, Canada’s WBC belt-holder Adonis Stevenson, to go through with their pre-contracted clash,. The man is fearless. Defeated: The Russian was unstoppable during his win over Cleverly in August of last year . Specimen: Kovalev celebrates after comfortably beating Cleverly in Cardiff in August 2013 . Already the oldest boxer to win and successfully defend a world title, he is determined to become the first 50-year-old ever to reign as world champion. If he beats Kovalev he will secure that remarkable place in history, since he would not be expected to fight again before his birthday on January 15. Krusher Kovalev, who despatched our own Nathan Cleverly into oblivion and almost into early retirement, predicts: ‘I will send The Alien to Mars.’ Hopkins, however, is one of the most difficult boxers on whom to land a concussive blow, as well as the shrewdest accumulator of points. One is 18 years older than the other but there is no certainty as to which of them will end up seeing stars on the night of November 8 on Broadway or the Boardwallk. The rash of dodgy decisions lately seems to be provoking more and more losers - amateur as well as professional – to cry foul by the judges. Close though it was on the official score-cards there was no doubt in my mind that Nicola Adams rightly made another slice of history in Glasgow. The sunny lass from Leeds, who became in London the first female boxer to win an Olympic gold medal, repeated that feat at the Commonwealth Games on Saturday. Just winner: Nicola Adams holds up her medal after winning Commonwealth Games gold in Glasgow . Not happy: Michaela Walsh, left, was not happy after judges ruled Adams to be the winner on Saturday . It was well-deserved but Ireland’s young Michaela Walsh cried ‘robbery,’ apparently believing she had been the victim of Adams’ reputation and status. How sad. Adams is well into her 30s now and the proper time and place for the promising Walsh to make her point will be at the Rio Olympics two years from now. Target: Walsh claimed she had been 'robbed' and that she was a victim of Adams' reputation and status . The night before in Wolverhampton, Frankie Gavin also went close but not close enough to taking the European welterweight title from Leonard Bundu. Gavin, despite being down and almost out in mid-fight, also blamed the judges . Not only that but he claimed Bundu told him he had really won. If so, the champion was being kind to ease Gavin’s disappointment. For the first time in nine years it was no Funtime for Franke but to his credit he apologised later for complaining. Gavin remembered the importance of dignity in defeat. Good for him and he will come again. For Miss Walsh, that is a lesson she has still to learn.","Bernard Hopkins has agreed to fight Sergey Kovalev on November 8 .

"By RUTH STYLES . With its elegant frescoes, delicate sweeps of cerise and violet bougainvillea and vast beds covered in pristine white linen, Palazzo Margherita is a palace fit for Hollywood royalty. But this is a far cry from your average star-studded holiday spot. Instead, the pretty 19th century palazzo is owned and run by one of modern cinema's greats - director Francis Ford Coppola. Nestled in the heart of the sleepy Basilicata town of Bernalda, where Coppola’s grandfather Agostino Coppola was born, the villa boasts nine luxurious suites, each of which is decorated with handpainted frescoes. And relax: The delicate frescoes and comfortable bed belonging to the 'Sofia' suite - a room inspired by Coppola's director daughter, Sofia . Chic: The palatial ensuite bathroom attached to the Sofia suite includes delicate patterned tiles, a standalone bath and toiletries by Italian brand Santa Maria Novella . Individual: The decoration in Suite Four (left) was inspired by Sofia Coppola while the luxurious Suite Nine (right) is intended to honour Coppola's grandmother Maria Zasa . The result of a collaboration between Coppola and French interior designer, Jacques Grange, other highlights include the flower-filled gardens, a chic tiled pool and a restaurant serving up locally sourced organic fare. First built in 1892, . palazzo was painstakingly restored by Coppola and Grange in 2004, and includes a wealth of personal motifs - among them the Tunisian elements that reference Coppola's grandmother, Maria Zasa, in Suite Nine. Elsewhere, features include restored marble floors, handpainted frescoes on every ceiling and palatial bedrooms, each with an ensuite bathroom and balcony overlooking the little town. The interior gardens feature lush, . semi-tropical plants, a magnificent fountain and a private swimming . pool. If that all feels like too much, the hotel offers guests spa treatments in their rooms, while in the evenings, the salon becomes a private cinema showing one of 300 Italian classic films, personally chosen by Coppola himself. Luxurious: Suite Nine, or, as it's also known, the Francis Suite, was inspired by the director's Tunisian grandmother and is the most expensive room . Relaxed: Suites are crammed with fresh flowers and boast TV's made by Spanish luxury goods giant, Loewe while staff are on call 24 hours a day . Roman . holiday: Suite Seven was inspired by Coppola's son Roman who is also a . director and was nominated for an Oscar for his film Moonrise Kingdom in . 2012 . Curated: The huge salon is transformed into a cinema when night falls, with guests offered a choice of 300 classic Italian films each chosen by Coppola himself . Unfortunately for those who want to become guests of the legendary director, a stay at Palazzo Margherita doesn't come cheap. A night in the hotel's most lavish suite costs up to £1,500 a night, while those wanting to stay in the cheapest accommodation, the Garden Room, will still have to find £460 to fund it. For those who can, the surrounding countryside with its tiny towns, rustic villages and vine-laden fields will help soften the blow when the bill arrives, while nearby Grottaglie is famous for its ceramic pots. If you've got the cash to spare, you can even follow in the Duke of Cambridge's footsteps and have some shirts whipped up for you by tailor Angelo Inglese at his Ginosa atelier. Speaking about his decision to open up Palazzo Margherita, Coppola said: 'I never initially dreamed of opening a . resort in Italy, let alone in the town of my grandfather Agostino . Coppola. 'Yet when I purchased and designed . the now Palazzo Margherita for friends and family to call home in Italy, . I knew I needed to extend the property and surrounding village of ""Bernalda bella"" to my guests as well.' Party time: Bar Cinecittà opens onto the plaza and serves up traditional Italian treats, while the wood-panelled Family Bar is where aperitifs are served . Magnificent: A fountain dominates the private gardens at the Palazzo Margherita, which also include a pool for guests to use . Glorious: The bougainvillea covered pool area (left) and the courtyard which is home to a selection of wicker chairs and tables that guests can use for supper . Stunning: . Guests can take their meals in the wisteria fringed courtyard as well . as enjoy a stroll in the landscaped private gardens beyond .

"A baby girl who suffers from a rare condition that caused her head to swell to nearly double its size is recovering in hospital today after receiving life-saving surgery. Following a series of preliminary procedures last week, 15-month-old Roona Begum, who was born with hydrocephalus, received a major operation at a hospital in Delhi, India, this morning. Surgeons at the private hospital run by the Fortis Healthcare group, offered to treat Roona for free after pictures emerged of her living with the condition in a village in rural state of Tripura. Scroll down for video . Roona Begum, a 15-month-old girl who suffers from a rare condition which caused her head to swell to twice its size is prepared for surgery at a hospital on the outskirts of New Delhi . Success: Doctors said the procedure went 'perfectly' and that the results were 'better than expected' Improved: 15-month old Roona, who was suffering from a buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to swelling has had life-saving surgery and the size of her head has reduced . Operation: So far doctors have reduced the swelling around 18-month-old Roona's head by nine inches . One surgeon Sandeep Vaishya told the AFP news agency: 'The surgery went perfectly, much better than expected. After Roona's plight appeared in a number of publications, including MailOnline, a charity came forward to offer help. Norwegian students, Jonas Borchgrevink and Nathalie Krantz, started an online campaign that raised $52,000 to help fund any further care needed. The Fortis Foundation flew the . poverty-stricken family from their rural village to the hospital in Gurgaon two weeks ago. Worried parents: Mother Fatima Khatoon, 24, and 19-year-old father Abdul Rehman . Waiting: Parents Fatima and Abdul at the private hospital near New Delhi where their daughter is being treatedia.

Sandeep Vaishya, Director of Neurosurgery at Fortis Memorial Research . Institute, who is treating Roona, said: 'I was surprised when I saw the . baby for the first time. Even though I had seen her pictures, I wasn't . expecting the head to be so big. 'Her head measures 94 cm, in similar cases the average measurement is around 50-60 cm.

Countdown:  Abdul and Fatima sit by their daughter's bedside in hospital ahead of  the life-saving surgery . Treatment: Roona is being treated at a private hospital after the Fortis Foundation offered to help . 'It is swollen to an extent that she . is not able to close her eyes completely. We have an opthamologist . looking at her eyes, so that there are no complications there. 'We . are hopeful that she will make a complete recovery. The challenge is to . drain her brain fluid in a gradual manner, so as the brain gets used to . it.' Fatima said: 'When she was born, I wondered why do children of poor people like us suffer this fate? Loving: Fatima Khatoon attempts to comfort her young daughter as she rests in her hospital bed . Poorly: Doctors say that Roona is lucky to be alive as sufferers of the condition normally do not live beyond a year . 'Why is fate cruel to us? Why do rich people who can afford to cure their kids never get diseases like this? 'Before she was born, I went to a doctor twice. Once when I was one month pregnant and than when I was six months pregnant. We did not have money to go more often. 'She was born through a Caesarian operation and the doctor told us we had to take her out of Agartala to get her treated. But we did not have any money at all.' But the devastated mother revealed some family members had been less than supportive. Fatima added: 'When she is better, I hope my in-laws accept her. And she can have the love she deserves from her grandparents.' Roona's father Abdul, 19, added: 'Even though our neighbours come and play with her, my parents have refused to acknowledge her existence, since she was born.' Abdul, who earns the equivalent of just £1.82 a day as a labourer thanked those who had helped Roona. He said: 'I cannot find work every day.

"Derya Sert, 22, who was born without a womb, had been receiving IVF treatment after the transplant in August 2011 . A woman who was the first to have a successful womb transplant from a dead donor has had her pregnancy terminated after the embryo showed no heartbeat, doctors in Turkey have said. Derya Sert, 22, who was born without a womb, had been receiving in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment after the transplant in August 2011. Her pregnancy was announced in April. But in a statement released today by Akdeniz University Hospital in Turkey's Mediterranean city of Antalya, it read: 'Derya Sert's pregnancy was terminated after her end of eight weeks examination showed no embryo heartbeat. 'The general health status of the patient is fine. 'IVF will be continued when she is ready, in appropriate conditions.' Thousands of British women born without a womb were given hope if the breakthrough treatment succeeded. But some British experts, including Lord Winston, claim that a pregnancy could cause potentially fatal complications. The baby would have to be born by caesarean, which carries the risks of surgery. Prof Ozkan performed the pioneering transplant on 22-year-old Derya Sert in August 2011. Prof Ozkan, from Akdeniz University in Antalya, Turkey, also revealed three more women were to undergo transplants at his clinic, providing Mrs Sert has a healthy baby. Mrs Sert, who is married to husband Mustafa, said at the time of the transplant: ‘If I had a magic wand, I would want to be pregnant now. I just want to hold my baby in my arms, to be a mother.’ One in every 5,000 women globally is born without a womb, while thousands more have the organ removed due to cancer or other diseases, leaving them unable to get pregnant. TV presenter Yvette Fielding revealed in 2009 that she had undergone a hysterectomy to stop her agonising periods. Fielding already has two children. However, many women are childless when they have the drastic surgery. Those in favour of womb transplants argue it is the only way to meet the desperate desire of many of these women to ‘carry’ their own baby. This need cannot be met if they use another woman as a surrogate, a controversial process that is strictly regulated in the UK and illegal in some countries, including France and Germany. Artificial selection: Mrs Sert had eight embryos frozen before her treatment in 2011 . Many British couples end up travelling to India, where clinics hire out women as surrogates. However, . this is fraught with legal issues. For example, couples whose surrogate . children are born abroad have to go to court in the UK to ‘prove’ they . are the legal parents. Adoption . does not give a woman the chance to have a child who is genetically her . own and, again, there is a strict vetting procedure. Surgeon Richard Smith, a consultant at Imperial College London, has spent more than 15 years researching the possibility of pregnancy among women who have had womb transplants. Last year he revealed his team had achieved the first successful pregnancy in a rabbit with a transplanted uterus, although the animal went on to miscarry. He planned to carry out the procedure on five more rabbits before it is trialled in sheep. Danger: Fertility expert Lord Winston says the risks are not worth taking. Surrogacy is an alternative option . Only then will Mr Smith approach UK ethics committees for approval to try it on humans. Women who have lost their wombs to cancer need to have been free of the disease for at least five years before they can be considered for a transplant. But womb transplants have been criticised by experts because they are not carried out to ‘save a life’. Risks include rejection of the new womb and potential side effects during pregnancy from the powerful anti-rejection drugs. After the first womb transplant, carried out in Saudi Arabia in 2000, the donated organ ‘failed’ after three months because the blood vessels used to connect it were too narrow and became blocked by clots. However, Prof Ozkan does not doubt womb transplants are worth the risks for thousands of women otherwise unable to have a ‘normal’ pregnancy. He has previously said: ‘Many people think that womb transplants aren’t necessary because they’re not lifesaving operations and that women have the option of adoption or surrogacy. ‘But we’ve had applications from women all over the world wanting womb transplants. This is absolutely necessary for these women: you just have to ask them to realise this.’ A total of 100 women were screened last year by Prof Ozkan in addition to Mrs Sert, who received her healthy organ from a car-crash victim. Ten of these have been selected as possible recipients. Prof Ozkan could have a race on his hands to become the first doctor to achieve a successful pregnancy from a womb transplant. Swedish experts carried out two procedures last year, both involving the world’s first mother-to-daughter uterus transplants. Prof Ozkan’s Turkish team used wombs from dead donors. The scientists and doctors at the University of Gothenburg had received approval to complete ten procedures in total. Doctors are divided over whether to use living or dead donors. Some experts are uncomfortable with  taking the womb from a living woman when it is not for life-saving reasons. With live transplants, there are risks to two living patients. However, an organ from a living donor can be a better match.","Derya Sert was born without a womb and had one transplanted in 2011 .

"More details have emerged about a bizarre and malicious assault incident at Boston airport at the weekend, in which a 26-year-old Harvard student fell into a women's bathroom naked through the ceiling before running into the hallway and biting the ear off an elderly man. Cameron Shenk was arraigned Wednesday on charges that include attempted murder, assault and battery on a person over 60, and lewd and lascivious conduct. The economics student at Harvard Extension School, who has no history of mental illness, allegedly took his clothes off, crawled into the ceiling, fell and then assaulted three people - the 84-year-old man and two troopers. Outside court his father offered a cryptic explanation for his son's wild behavior, suggesting Shenk may have been under the influence of something, according to WHDH. Scroll down for video . Refused bail: Cameron Shenk, 26, appears at his arraignment at East Boston Municipal Court on Wednesday on charges that include attempted murder, assault and battery on a person over 60, and lewd and lascivious conduct . Bizarre behavior: Police say the 26-year-old Shenk fell through the ceiling of a women's bathroom at Boston's Logan airport at about noon Saturday . Stripped off: He had allegedly sneaked into the bathroom, undressed inside a stall and climbed into the ceiling crawl space. Police say he then fled the bathroom and assaulted an 84-year-old man . 'Dangerous': He has been ordered held without bail pending a hearing next week . Derek Shenk, who flew into Boston to appear at his son's arraignment, said afterwards: 'It was a singular event. The best analogy that I can say is that we could all learn a lot from Snow White. If you're given an apple, sometimes it really does contain poison.' It is unclear exactly what Mr Shenk was alluding to with his analogy. Cameron Shenk accessed the roof by sneaking into the women's bathroom about noon on Saturday. After stripping, he climbed up into a crawl space, but the roof gave way and he fell back down. Police say he then fled the bathroom and ran into the 84-year-old bystander in the hallway. 'And (he) began choking that man with his cane,' prosecutor Emily Hamrock said in court Wednesday. 'JetBlue employees came when they heard the commotion and tried to break up the incident and in the process this defendant leaned in and bit off a large part of that elderly man's ear.' Shenk was finally subdued by two troopers, but allegedly assaulted both in the process while trying to fight them off. Ceiling: The roof of the women's bathroom (pictured) gave way after Shenk climbed into a crawl space . Shenk was naked and bleeding at the time. 'He is truly remorseful about what happened here, particularly with regard to the gentleman who was injured as a result of his conduct,' Shenk's lawyer, Frank O'Brien, told . Shenk was has been ordered held without bail. A hearing to determine whether he is dangerous to the public is scheduled Monday. The elderly victim is still recovering from the attack. Shenk was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital following the incident. Cameron Shenk, 26, who sneaked into the women's bathroom at Boston's Logan Airport before climbing into a ceiling space naked, was treated in Massachusetts General Hospital .

"This astonishing footage - captured when a skydiver dropped his GoPro camera at 4,000ft - shows what it's like to freefall to the ground. The one-minute video shows the very moment the helmet camera becomes detached and makes its spiralling descent back  to earth. After what starts out as a relatively normal jump, the camera begins its stomach-churning plunge as the skydiver pulls his parachute. Warning: Video contains fast-moving images. In its descent the GoPro camera recorded its owner falling to earth in a far more controlled manner . Initially the free-falling camera, while rotating, shows the skydiver moving  further away. But it isn't long before the camera picks up speed, spins out of control, and captures some dizzying footage. The camera continues to record after it slammed into the ground. Fortunately for the skydiver he was able to locate the device after he landed. The incredible footage was captured over Seville, Spain, recently.

"An adorable video of a baby listening to Canadian Rock Band Rush for the first time has emerged online and it’s bound to bring a smile to your face. Sitting on what appears to be his dad’s lap, the nine-month-old baby looks tiny in a dwarfing pair of adult-sized headphones. With his eyes wide open in anticipation, the baby named Hector, pulls a frown and begins bobbing his head up and down as the music kicks in. Hector gets into the groove bobbing his head, frowning and yawning  while listening to Rush for the first time . Becoming – if possible – more wide-eyed, the youngster gets into a bit of a groove and even starts adding some accompanying eyebrow movements to his routine. While the music itself is silent in the video, the man can be heard laughing along in the background before pointing the camera at the screen and showing the track that the baby is listening to – Rush’s 2112. Returning to the baby, the video picks up the youngster frowning, yawning and checking out his surroundings while he continues to bob his head. Dwarfed in a large pair of headphones, the youngster pulls a number of faces as he listens along to the music . Judging by the video, Hector is listening to Rush's 2112 somewhere between ‘The Temples of Syrinx’  and ‘Discovery’ Released in 1976, Rush’s 2112 is a 20 minute 34 second song arranged into seven chapters. Judging by the video, which momentarily shows the computer screen, the baby is listening somewhere between ‘The Temples of Syrinx’ section, which ends quite loudly, and ‘Discovery’, which begins rather more melodically.","The 9-month-old sits wide-eyed in a pair of dwarfing headphones .

"A three-limbed elephant was given a new lease of life when it was fitted with a brand new prosthetic leg in Thailand. Mosha, the nine-year-old female elephant, lost her leg when she stepped on a landmine back in 2006. The MaeYao National Reserve in Lampang, who claim to have built the world’s first elephant hospital, has attached five prosthetic limbs to Mosha since her arrival. Mosha, the nine-year-old female elephant, lost her leg when she stepped on a landmine back in 2006 . Brought to the hospital at seven-months-old, Mosha became the first elephant in the world to be fitted with an artificial leg. Since then her continued growth has resulted in staff building a number of increasingly stronger bespoke legs to help support the animal's weight. In the video the three-legged elephant is initially shown struggling to walk around the enclosure before it rests its stump on a wooden rail.

"Formula One boss Jean Todt has asked for a full report into the accident that left Marussia driver Jules Bianchi in a critical condition in a Japanese hospital for a second night on Monday. FIA race director Charlie Whiting is compiling the dossier and is expected to present his findings to Todt before Sunday’s Russian Grand Prix. An FIA spokesman told Sportsmail that the ‘in-depth’ investigation would ‘cross-check a number of different sources of information to be as complete and detailed as possible in order to understand exactly why the accident occurred’. Marussia driver Jules Bianchi dramatically crashed out at the same site as Adrian Sutil's Sauber (left) Bianchi spun off in wet conditions and hit the recovery vehicle, which was about to tow Sutil's  Sauber . An unconscious Bianchi was taken to hospital where he remained on Sunday and Monday evening . Camille Marchetti prayed for her boyfriend Bianchi as he continues to fight for his life in a Japanese hospital . FIA President Jean Todt has asked for a full report into the accident and will receive it prior to Sunday's Russian Grand Prix . FIA race director Charlie Whiting is compiling the dossier that will look to address how the accident happened . Japanese F1 fan Ikeda writes a message on a picture of Bianchi at the Mie General Medical Centre . A message of support, featuring an image of Bianchi, is left outside the medical centre in Yokkaichi . Bianchi, the 25-year-old French driver of the British-based Marussia team, remained in intensive care in Yokkaichi after emergency surgery on a severe head injury, following his high-speed crash into a recovery vehicle during the latter stages of the rain-lashed Japanese Grand Prix. Marussia issued a statement thanking people for a ‘huge outpouring of support and affection for Jules and the team at this very difficult time’, but did not give an update on his condition. An FIA spokesman confirmed later that he was ‘critical but stable’. Sources at the hospital said Bianchi was breathing but only with the help of a ventilator, not on his own as was originally reported in the French media on Sunday night. The brain surgeon who advised Michael Schumacher's treatment, Frenchman Gerard Saillant, has flown out to Japan to join the team caring for Bianchi. Bianchi’s condition was the overwhelming topic of conversation among Formula One’s tight-knit community as it gathered in various airport lounges on Monday. Many flights out of Japan and eventually on to Sochi, the home of Sunday’s first race in Russia, were postponed by Typhoon Phanfone. Medics rush to the aid of French driver Bianchi after an accident during the Japanese Grand Prix . The race was not moved forward from the 3pm start time despite the forecast for heavy rain later in the day . Bianchi, 25, from Nice in France, is competing in his second season of Formula One, and right, him in action during Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix . 'My champion'! Bianchi's long-term partner, Camille Marchetti, led prayers for the driver's recovery . The rain and wind was at its strongest around 6am local time on Monday, and delayed Bianchi’s family’s arrival at his bedside until Monday afternoon, by when the skies were blue. Professor Gerard Saillant, president of the FIA medical commission who oversaw Michael Schumacher’s part-recovery, also flew out to Japan, along with Bianchi’s manager, Nicolas Todt, Jean Todt’s son. Bianchi’s girlfriend Camille Marchetti tweeted: ‘You are my champion! You are the strongest.’ The typhoon overshadowed the build-up to the Japanese Grand Prix. Sportsmail can reveal that the FIA stewards asked Bernie Ecclestone to bring the race forward to avoid the downpours that were forecast for the scheduled start time of 3pm. Sportsmail understands that Bernie Ecclestone refused to allow the race start time to be changed . Citing the sport’s commitments to television contracts, it is understood he refused to give way. However, the FIA are responsible for safety and Todt, as the president with ultimate authority in this sphere, could have intervened had he wished. It should be emphasised, though, that there is no direct link between the timing of the race and the accident, other than if, as Adrian Sutil of Sauber claimed, the light deteriorated too much to be safe by the time it was abandoned after Bianchi’s crash. A subject raised by a number of F1 personnel in the airports on Monday was why the safety car was not deployed when Sutil crashed at Turn seven, the accident that brought out the tractor into which Bianchi spun. Track marshals and medics administer urgent attention to  Bianchi after his crash at Suzuka in Japan . Sutil (centre) looks distressed as he talks to medical staff while Bianchi receives attention . Sportsmail understands that Whiting will say in his report that he acted as is the norm in instances when a car is a long way off the track, against a barrier, marshals are in control, a tractor is on its way, a dry line is present on the track and yellow flags or, in this instance, double yellow flags are being waved — a safety car is not deployed. Former FIA boss Max Mosley, speaking on Sky, described the incident as ‘a freak accident’. He added: ‘I can’t see any fault attached to the people involved.’ But Jacques Villeneuve, the 1997 world champion, said: ‘I have always said that every time there is an accident there should be a safety car. There should not be room for judgment.’ It is understood the FIA could look at several options such as imposing a speed limit for drivers under yellow, or double yellow, flags though that idea has never previously gained widespread support from the teams.

But she continues towards the shop's exit, replying to him aggressively: ‘Stop, let’s just take it’ and, in reply to his request to buy a TV: ‘No, we already have one – A TV in the living room.’ The video concludes with her heading down an aisle, perhaps in a bid to give her dad the slip.

"Chris de Burgh found her irresistible, and now scientists say that ladies wearing red really are more attractive to men. A new study claims that wearing the colour increases a woman’s sex appeal and also makes her seem more approachable and competent. It says that women also find red attractive on men – but the effect isn't as powerful. Scroll down for video . A new study claims that wearing red increases a woman’s sex appeal and also makes her seem more approachable and competent. Here, Scarlett Johansson (left) and Kim Kardashian (right) wear eye-catching red dresses on the red carpet . Psychologists at Central China Normal University, in Wuhan, China, showed 280 heterosexual students 32 pictures of the opposite sex and asked them to rate them according to how attractive they found them. The people in the photos were wearing either blue, white or red. Male students found ‘feminine’ women wearing red the most attractive and also rated them highest for looking ‘warm’ and competent. The study says that women also find red attractive on men – but the effect isn't as powerful. Justin Bieber is pictures in a bright red jacket . ‘The colour red was shown to have a boosting effect on the sexual attractiveness of women with feminine facial traits,’ lead author Dr Fangfang Wen wrote in the study, published in the journal, Evolutionary Psychology. ‘In addition, regardless of sexual dimorphism cues, male participants rated women with red as warmer and more competent.’ She suggests that by choosing red, women are reflecting their sexual intentions ‘from the beginning’. Scientists from the University of British Columbia in Canada last year claimed that women tend to wear red or pink when they are ovulating – the time of the month that they are at their most fertile – in a bid to attract a mate. Red has been associated with romance, passion, lust and fertility across nearly every long-standing civilisation, while previous research claimed its effect in enhancing sexual attraction suggests ‘higher sexual opportunity for males’. This study says that red clothing also has a ‘marginally significant effect on men’s sexual attractiveness’. This may be because red can indicate higher status in some vertebrates and females evolve to prefer males that are high in status to provide for their babies. However, the study found that wearing too much red can make women think that men could be aggressive – taking cues from nature, when animals’ and people’s faces redden to denote anger. ‘The colour red was shown to have a boosting effect on the sexual attractiveness of women with feminine facial traits,’ lead author Dr Fanfang Wen wrote in the study, published in the journal, Evolutionary Psychology. Here, Jennifer Aniston is pictured at the Oscars in a floor-sweeping red dress . A growing body of research has revealed that women give off signals about the inner workings of their body by the way they dress - and red, quite simply, means ‘I want sex’. Scientists have discovered that women tend to wear red or pink when they are ovulating – the time of the month that they are at their most fertile – in a bid to attract a mate. Researchers from the University of British Columbia in Canada surveyed 124 women, asking them the colour of their clothing and how many days it has been since their last period. They found that women at highest risk of becoming pregnant were substantially more likely to be wearing a red or pink-coloured shirt compared to women at low risk. Those who wore red or pink were about three times more likely to be at peak fertility than those who wore other colours. And this female preference for red at certain times of the month is not in vain. A survey by dating website OkCupid found that women who wear red in their online dating profile photos are more likely to get messages and dates than those wearing any other colour.","Study claims colour also makes women seem warmer and more competent .

"Previously unnoticed audio from a video recorded in the chaotic moments after Michael Brown's fatal shooting last Saturday in Ferguson, Missouri, could help back up Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson's version of events. Overheard while one man films the gruesome aftermath of Brown's daylight shooting, the barely discernible audio is of one unseen man recounting the alleged version of events that he saw to another man, off camera, while bystanders scream and shout at police to assist the stricken 18-year-old. At around the six minute and 30 second mark in the 10 minute long video, one man is just heard over raucous shouting asking another how Brown ended up at least 30-feet away from the police squad car that presumably was being driven by Wilson. WARNING: EXTREMELY GRAPHIC AND UPSETTING VIDEO . The body of Michael Brown lies on the ground in the aftermath of his shooting death . The first man explains to the second man that Brown was there because he had previously been near the police car and run, which contradicts what the teens friend, Dorian Johnson, has told police and in interviews. Johnson has said that Brown was never inside or near Officer Wilson's police car before the shooting. Johnson alleges that Wilson exited his car and struck 6ft 4inch Brown as he was trying to open the door, setting off the calamitous series of events that ended with Brown running from a shooting Wilson, before turning with his hands raised in surrender before being gunned down. The audio heard in the video gives a different version of events. The alleged witness tells the man that Brown apparently had a confrontation with Wilson near to or in his vehicle and ran away. 'Then the next thing I know he doubled back towards him cus (sic) the police had his gun drawn already on him,' according to blog, Conservative Tree House. The witness then contradicts the now crucial narrative of the how the tragic events unfolded last Saturday.

The photo shows shocked onlookers watch . as police peer at the teen's dead body . Ferguson police officer: Darren Wilson, 28, pictured receiving a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February has been named as the police officer who shot dead Michael Brown, 18 . Instead of Brown being fired on while his hands were raised in surrender, the witness claims that Brown was moving towards the officer when he was shot. While this version of events does not match most of the eyewitness accounts, it does seem to tally up in a small part with the account of what occurred given by a friend of Wilson. Begins at 6:28/6:29 of video . Man 1: 'How’d he get from there to there?' Eyewitness: 'Because he ran, the police was still in the truck – cause he was like over the truck' Eyewitness: 'But him and the police was both in the truck, then he ran – the police got out and ran after him' Eyewitness: 'Then the next thing I know he doubled back toward him cus - the police had his gun drawn already on him' Man 1: 'Oh, the police got his gun' Eyewitness: 'The police kept dumpin on him, and I’m thinking the police kept missing – he like – be like – but he kept coming toward him(crosstalk)' Eyewitness: 'Police fired shots – the next thing I know – the police was missing' Man 1: 'The Police?' Eyewitness: 'The Police shot him' Man 1: 'Police?' Eyewitness: 'The next thing I know … I’m thinking … the dude started running …  then something about he took it from him' 'He pulled up ahead of them. And then he got a call-in that there was a strong-arm robbery. And, they gave a description,' said the friend in an interview with Josie on The Dana Show. 'And, he’s looking at them and they got something in their hands and it looks like it could be what, you know those cigars or whatever. So he goes in reverse back to them.

"Two teachers who were fired from a New York City high school in 2009 after an alleged lesbian tryst in a classroom are getting their jobs back after an appeals court in Manhattan ruled in their favor in a decision handed down Thursday. Cindy Mauro, a 34-year-old French . teacher at Brooklyn’s James Madison High School, was caught half naked . in a classroom, 'kneeling between the legs' of a topless fellow teacher, . an independent arbitrator found. Mauro . and her alleged lover, . 32-year-old Spanish teacher Alini Brito, had vehemently denied . allegations of a 'lesbian . lovefest.' The 34-year-old claimed that she was only helping Brito deal . with her diabetes by bringing her some candy to raise her blood glucose . levels. Disgraced teachers Alini Brito (left) and Cindy Mauro are allowed to teach again following an appeal after being fired for 'lesbian tryst' Even if the allegations of sexual misconduct are true, the five-judge Appellate Court ruled that firing the two women was 'shockingly disproportionate to (their) misconduct.' 'While (Brito’s) behavior demonstrated a . lapse in judgment, there is no evidence that this incident was anything . but a one-time mistake,' the panel ruled. In their decision, the justices ruled that even if the reports are true, 'consensual sexual contact' was not grounds to fire them. The justices also noted the 'unblemished disciplinary records' of each teacher, as well as their 'consistently satisfactory teacher ratings.' In Brito's case, her supervisor once described her as 'one of the best teachers she had ever worked with,' according to the report, first obtained by the New York Daily news. The court sent the case back to city education officials with instructions to impose a less-severe penalty. Sine the allegations first arose - on the word of a janitor who claimed he saw the two women engaged in sexual activity - both teachers denied they were . ever naked, alleging that the custodian who walked in on them during a . school talent show had a vivid imagination. The two women were language teachers at James Madison high School in New York City . The scandal earned the school a suggestive nickname: Horndog High. Lawyers . representing the city said in court documents that the teachers’ alibi . was hard to believe because no medical equipment was found in Room 337, . where the pair allegedly was busted. The city also pointed out that Brito . and Mauro had climbed six flights of stairs before arriving at their . destination, passing multiple classrooms and more than one bathroom — . unlikely behavior for someone suffering from low blood sugar. Judge Robert Torres apparently agreed, . upholding an arbitrator’s decision in 2012 to fire Mauro as . ‘rational and with plausible basis.’ Bad press: The alleged affair earned the school the unflattering nickname 'Horndog High' The ruling came less than two weeks . after another judge allowed Brito to return to the classroom after she had . successfully sued the Department of Education. Judge Alice Schlesinger wrote in her opinion that Brito's punishment was ‘excessive and shockingly severe,’ the New York Post reported. ‘We have children who are deprived of a first-class, . caring teacher, and a teacher who, due to one sensational, publicly . exploited incident where she exhibited extremely poor judgment, is . deprived of continuing a career she loves and excels at. ‘That is not a good balance, in the opinion of this court. In fact, the imbalance is shockingly bad,’ Schlesinger wrote. The judge criticized the city for . destroying a surveillance tape supposedly documenting the act, which she . said had deprived the teacher of due process. Denial: Brito and Mauro claim nothing inappropriate went on and that witnesses let their imaginations get the best of them . Brito’s lawyers claimed it was a crucial piece of evidence that could prove witness accounts to be false. The married teacher was fired in January, 2012, following the release of a report that claimed Mauro had lured her away from a student song-and-dance . competition with promises of sugar and candy. In her lawsuit, Brito claimed that the account of the witness to the events was not reliable because he never entered the classroom and a 300-pound janitor was blocking his view through a small opening in the door. 'There were no shenanigans,' said her lawyer Michael Valentine. 'He sees through this other custodian, who's 6'4"" or 6'5"", and sees a partially naked body lying on the floor.' Doubt: School officials find it hard to believe the pair walked up six flights of stairs to treat a diabetic's blood-sugar problem . Valentine offered a much more innocent . version of events, claiming: 'Upon immediately entering the classroom, . Brito's knees buckled, at which point Brito laid down off to the right . but at the foot of the classroom door. 'Mauro assisted Brito by placing . Brito's sweater under her head and elevated her legs in a chair. Mauro . also obtained a couple of sugar packets from her desk and gave them to . Brito.' It's unclear when - or if - the women will be returning to their jobs at James Madison High School.","The two language teachers were fired in 2012 over an alleged lesbian tryst in a classroom .

"Locals have created a Facebook page for Herschel 'Bud' Moore to raise funds for the WWII veteran who was robbed inside his home in Indiana . An Indiana war hero was tied up and assaulted in his own home as two raiders stole a large amount of cash. Herschel 'Bud' Moore was assaulted on Friday as the two men robbed his home in Arcadia, Hamilton County in Indiana. The 94-year-old victim was tied up and beaten by the two robbers, although the World War II veteran managed to bite one of his assailants on the finger. Deputy Bryant Orem confirmed the men took a large amount of money during Friday's home invasion. Hamilton County Sheriff's Department confirmed that the men also ransacked the house. According to the Indystar.com the victim managed to free himself and call for help after Friday's raid. Deputy Orem said the two suspects are believed to have been white and both wore masks. A social media campaign supporting the veteran has been launched. A Go Fund Me account as has so far raised $315 out of $5,000 in the first 12 hours of fundraising. A Facebook page, featuring the elderly veteran's shocking industry has been established. It is calling for anyone who knows the attackers to contact the sheriff's department so the attackers can be arrested. Moore suffered extensive bruising to the side of his face as he was pistol-whipped by the two assailants. It is understood that police have identified two suspects who they want to talk to in connection with the case. Moore's friend Mike Probst told WTHR.com that there is a great deal of anger in the community. He said he was 'pretty much irate. Made me mad that someone would go in and do this to a helpless man. 'Hopefully justice prevails and either the police or someone else will find them and I'm sure...they'll get their karma.'

"Talented southpaw Frankie Gavin was sent back to the drawing board as he was methodically bludgeoned to a split decision loss by classy European welterweight champion Leonard Bundu in Wolverhampton. The unbeaten Birmingham star looked out of his depth early on as Bundu’s vast experience and technical aptitude saw him a step ahead. Gavin seemed to find his feet in the early middle rounds but was floored by a body shot in the sixth and despite showing huge heart and flashes of skill, never recovered en route to a first professional loss which could have been much wider. Beaten: Leonard Bundu is crowned the winner after ending Frankie Gavin's unbeaten record on Friday . Gavin, the only Briton to ever win a world amateur title, was making the step up having already established himself as the British and Commonwealth champion and in truth had his long-term sights set on world honours. However, victory at the Civic Hall was far from a foregone conclusion for the 19-0 prospect (12KO wins). Bundu, born in Sierra Leone but based in Italy, boasted a proud unbeaten record of 30 wins and two draws on his ledger coming in, and the 39-year-old’s tally of just 11 early wins did not do him justice.The Brummie lost the first three rounds as Bundu landed the more effective shots. The local man was finding European waters deeper than he had anticipated but showed signs - albeit too fleetingly - that the task might not be beyond him. The fourth was by far his best as he calmed himself down and kept his composure. But he was down in the sixth from a crushing right to the body which saw him crumple to the canvas. He dug deep, however, to rise with the count at nine and see the bell. Blow: Gavin was convinced he had won but is now hoping to rebuild and fight for the European title once more . Bundu sensed blood and waged war with Gavin, cut around one eye, under heavy fire but roared on by a partisan midlands crowd. The end looked imminent but again Gavin survived. Belgian referee Daniel van der Wiele should arguably have stopped the fight as the onslaught went on but Gavin somehow survived into the ninth. He may have even won the last three rounds - the last was perhaps his best - before scores of 114-113 by two judges, against 117-115 to Gavin by their colleague, ensured Bundu kept his crown and added Gavin’s Commonwealth belt. 'I’m gutted,' said Gavin. 'I thought I won it and even Bundu told me I’d won. I haven’t lost a fight in nine years as an amateur or pro so it’s hard to take. 'But hopefully he’ll vacate the belt and fight for a world title and I can rebuild and fight for the European again.'","Frankie Gavin loses unbeaten record to Leonard Bundu in Wolverhampton on Friday .

"A top Dallas doctor today described the moment nurse Nina Pham learned she had contracted Ebola after caring for victim Thomas Eric Duncan in hospital, saying: 'She was scared'. Dr Gary Weinstein worked alongside 26-year-old Miss Pham  to treat Mr Duncan, a 42-year-old Liberian who was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28. He said his colleague was petrified when she realised she had been infected with the deadly virus, saying: 'She risked her life to care for a patient, and now she was afraid for her life.' But he added: 'I think once she got over the initial fear and concern and was surrounded by her friends and colleagues,  that was comforting. She did remarkably well, emotionally.' Scroll down for videos . Doctor: Dr Gary Weinstein today described the moment his colleague Nina Pham, 26, learned she had contracted Ebola after caring for victim Thomas Eric Duncan in hospital, saying: 'She was scared' Victim: Dr Weinstein worked alongside Miss Pham (pictured, left, and, right, in hospital after her diagnosis) to treat Mr Duncan, a  Liberian who was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28 . Miss Pham, who suffered from a fever with a temperature of above 100.5 degrees prior to her devastating diagnosis, is now in a 'fair' condition at a National Institutes of Health isolation unit. She is one of two nurses to have developed Ebola after caring for Mr Duncan, who died on October 8. The second worker, Amber Vinson, 29, was diagnosed with the disease on Wednesday. She was later airlifted to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital in Georgia on a specialized plane with a quarantine unit. Speaking to WFAA-TV, Dr Weinstein insisted the two nurses - along with the rest of the team - had followed CDC guidelines, which, at the time, did not include the use of a full respiratory mask. When asked why Miss Pham and Miss Vinson caught Ebola, he said: 'I think that these two nurses took care of a critically-ill patient at a time when he was not in control of his body fluids. 'And at a time when the recommendations from the CDC (Centers of Disease Control and Prevention) that we were following did not include the full respiratory mask.' Bedridden: Dr Weinstein, who was captured on video earlier this week telling a bedridden Miss Pham not to cry (pictured), said his colleague was petrified when she realised she had been infected with the virus . Comforting: The doctor, who was behind the camera, told the brave nurse: 'Well, happy tears are okay' Hospital: During the converstion, Dr Weinsten insisted Miss Pham - along with the rest of the team at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital (pictured) - had followed CDC guidelines during their care of Mr Duncan . His comments are in stark contrast to the CDC's claims that a 'breach of protocol' must have taken place to enable the infection to spread through the two nurses' protective gear. The center is currently preparing to issue new guidelines on protective gear to safeguard the well-being of doctors and nurses who are caring for Ebola patients. During the conversation, Dr Weinstei said despite knowing of Mr Duncan's contagious condition, both Miss Vinson and Miss Pham volunteered to look after him, joining an 'amazing' medical team. 'It's been so heartwarming. This kind of illness, this process that we've been through, this is the essence of nursing. This is the epitome of health care,' he said. Another patient: Miss Pham is one of two nurses to have developed Ebola after caring for Mr Duncan, who died on October 8. The second, Amber Vinson (pictured) was diagnosed with the disease on Wednesday . Transfer: She was later airlifted to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital in Georgia on a specialized plane . The doctor, who was captured on video earlier this week telling a bedridden Miss Pham not to cry - unless they were 'happy tears'' - gave the nurse a hug in his hazmat suit following her diagnosis. He told the news station that Mr Duncan's death 10 days ago was 'very, very quick', saying: 'He was critically ill and unstable, and over a period of minutes, he lost his pulse and was dead,' He also revealed that, in terms of Ebola, he considered himself to be 'no risk', despite having spent days caring for all three victims of the disease at the Dallas-based hospital. He said this was because Mr Duncan's bodily fluids were being controlled by the time he started caring for him, and he has worn a respiratory mask in the presence of all three patients. Tragic: Dr Weinstein said he considered himself 'no risk' because Mr Duncan's (pictured) bodily fluids were being controlled by the time he started caring for him, and he has worn a respiratory mask at all times . 'My only interactions with any of these patients have been in completely covered respirators, no skin showing to the outside world,' said Dr Weinstein. 'I think I'm no risk.' However, he revealed he has been asked by officials to avoid public places and public transport, and to take his temperature on a daily basis. According to the latest figures, the Ebola death toll has now struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191. Outbreak: It comes as the Ebola death toll has struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191. Above, a health worker carries a baby to an Ebola holding center . Most cases of the virus have been recorded in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, all in West Africa . Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said. Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear. It is transmitted through direct contact with the affected person's bodily fluids.","Dr Gary Weinstein worked with Nina Pham, 26, at Dallas-based hospital .

"Love is blind: Ceri Shipman went to extreme lengths to try and free her rapist boyfriend . The girlfriend of a convicted rapist tried to clear his name by framing two of his victims with fake Facebook profiles. Ceri Shipman, 25, set up bogus accounts and used them to send messages supposedly from the women saying they had made up the allegations. She acted after her boyfriend Jason Savage was jailed indefinitely for a string of violent rapes, being branded 'cold, calculating and sadistic' by a judge. In an attempt to clear him, Shipman used the fake profiles to send herself messages from the women which 'admitted' to lying about the rapes. One read: 'Maybe I did make up the rape but he broke my heart.' Another said: 'You should have met up with us, lied and got comp.' Believing the profiles were genuine, detectives arrested the two victims and questioned them at a police station for 13 hours. The women had already endured the ordeal of giving evidence at the trial of Savage, 29, before he was jailed in 2010. The victims were on police bail for four months as officers investigated Shipman's false claims, made six months after her boyfriend was sentenced. She had accessed their real Facebook accounts and copied pictures and profiles into the fake ones to make them appear genuine. Other messages read: 'Glad I met up with all them, we had a right good chat before court and look where it got him.' Another read: 'Maybe we did lie but nothing you can do about it.' Shipman, of Hull, replied, posting: 'See what I mean, you lied and you just admitted it, how can you live with yourself?'

"Searching for a medieval king who had been lost for 527 years always looked like a long shot. In a discovery worthy of a Hollywood film, however, archaeologists yesterday announced they had unearthed what appear to be the remains of Richard III. Using historic maps, they traced a friary where he was rumoured to have been buried after being killed in battle – underneath a social services department car park in Leicester. Scroll down for video . The spot (circled in red) where archaeologists found the remains of the 15th century monarch . And after only three weeks of digging, . to their astonishment they found the skeleton of an adult male who was . well-built and clearly of noble descent. His injuries – a metal arrowhead . embedded in his back, and a severe blow to the head – are consistent . with the king's death at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Even more persuasive is the fact that the man has a severely curved spine; Richard was famously nicknamed Crookback. The revelation that the skeleton, . exhumed on September 4, had severe scoliosis provoked a gasp at the . packed press conference in Leicester's Tudor-era Guildhall building . yesterday. He was not a hunchback, the . archaeologists said, but his right shoulder was higher than his left – . consistent with accounts of Richard's appearance. As any scholar of Shakespeare will . know, the king was famously ridiculed as a hunchback in the Bard's play, . described as 'rudely stamp'd, deformed, unfinish'd'. The final resting place of Richard III? A body matching his description was found here buried in a shroud . Experts stress that the remains must . be subjected to rigorous DNA testing, to be undertaken over the next . three months, to be sure if it is him. But they say the discovery is a . potentially 'historic moment'. Richard Taylor, of Leicester University, said: 'This search has at times resembled a Dan Brown novel in its twists and turns. 'We have all been witness to a powerful and historic story unfolding before our eyes.' Michael Ibsen, a 16th generation relation of King Richard III gives a DNA mouth swab at Greyfriars Car Park, Leicester. His DNA will be used to determine whether the skeleton found is King Richard III . Richard III, the last monarch of the . Plantagenet family, ruled for only two years before dying in battle in . 1485 when he was 32. It marked the end of the Wars of the Roses and the victory of Henry Tudor, the first of the new dynasty. Under the new regime, Richard was . portrayed as a hunchback and a power-mad child-killer said to have . slaughtered his two young nephews to seize the throne. A map of the medieval chuch of the Grey Friars where the remains were found. Archaeologists have found a skeleton they believe could be the remains of King Richard III, the tyrant king. It has an arrow in its back and a curved spine, a condition believed to have affected the monarch. Closer and closer: Fragments of what could be the east end window of the church . The earliest surviving portrait of Richard III in Leicester Cathedral. Archaeologists are hoping to find his grave under a council car park in Leicester. Historians say that the find could . help settle a five-century-long controversy over whether the king was . the villain of legend, or a victim of malicious propaganda. Richard III was thought to be buried . at Grey Friars, a Franciscan friary destroyed during Henry VIII's . Dissolution of the Monasteries, but it was later claimed his body was . thrown into a river. In the early 1600s the site of Grey . Friars was bought by the mayor of Leicester, Alderman Robert Herrick, . and used as his garden. In 1612 Christopher Wren, father of . the famous architect, recorded seeing a 3ft stone pillar in the garden . inscribed: 'Here lies the body of Richard III, sometime King of . England.' The site was bought by Leicester City Council in 1914. Lead archaeologist Richard Buckley . said: 'We were very lucky it was a car park, and the remains, at the . entrance to the choir, were just under the trench we dug, when there . were several buildings at the friary. 'He's a prime candidate. I'd be very surprised if someone else was buried at this same spot with critical injuries.' The university intends for the body, if it is proven to be Richard, to be buried in the city's cathedral. As for the social workers, the academics said, it will be 'quite some time' before they get their car park back.

The leading role has been played by Laurence Olivier and Sir Ian McKellen, and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks. The battle marked the final . confrontation between the Yorkist king Richard III and his challenger . Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond and leader of the House of Lancaster.

"Samantha Brick, the Daily Mail writer, who sparked an avalanche of debate when she declared 'Why do women hate me for being beautiful?' is dominating the internet for a second day running - this time for her fierce reaction to her critics. In just hours Samantha's article yesterday became a worldwide sensation and today her name is still trending globally on Twitter as users continue to discuss her controversial opinion. Her fiery response posted online today, in which she says her 'detractors have simply proved my point,' has again provoked a deluge of online comments. Quite a reaction: Samantha Brick's tell-all piece about how women hate her has sparked a huge reaction around the world . Admittedly, not all were supportive with . many people saying she was 'delusional' and 'against feminism,' and others accused her of being . deliberately provocative. Some users however, rode to her defence and said she had a right to freedom of expression and several people said 'at least she is honest about her views.' The comment on today's article which received the most red arrows - meaning users did not like it- was from Christine in Salt Lake City, U.S. She wrote: 'This women has what every women wants !! SELF ESTEEM!!! Every women should be able to look at themselves as the most beautiful women in the world .You go girl!!!!' The comment which 8,240 users deemed a positive with green arrows was written by Rebs, in Dublin, Ireland. She wrote: 'We don't dislike you for thinking you are beautiful, that's fine. It's your arrogant deluded attitude that is annoying.' Samantha's original article and her response have been our two most read stories on the MailOnline for the past two days - gaining nearly 8,000 comments on the site between them and still growing. Today she stated: 'While I've been shocked and hurt by the global condemnation, I have just this to say: my detractors have simply proved my point. Their level of anger only underlines that no one in this world is more reviled than a pretty woman.' She adds that she isn't surprised Victoria Beckham has moved to Los Angeles as, as, in Samantha's words: 'She knows better than anyone how your looks can be used against you in Britain — here we reward false modesty instead and gang up against anyone who isn't suitably self-deprecating.' Sarcastic comment: Reality TV star Sally Bercow took to Twitter to post about Samantha Brick . Internet storm: Samantha, who lives with her French husband Pascal Rubinatin the Dordogne, could have had no idea what a reaction her piece would provoke . This chart shows how the search term 'Samantha Brick' exploded into life on Twitter today . Yesterday the top-rated comment . following her first piece was from Annie, in Toronto, Canada, who was . awarded an astonishing 18,000 'green arrows' from fellow readers for . saying Samantha needs a 'reality check'. But there's no doubting people found her tell-all interesting - since the confessional piece was published yesterday Samantha's story has racked up more than 1.5million hits on our site. The story has also been picked up and commented on by dozens more around the world as interest in it spread across the internet. It has been used on . everything from the The Daily Telegraph and The Independent's websites in the UK to . ABC News in the U.S. and fashion magazine Stylist. On Facebook nearly 50,000 shared it with their friends and at one point yesterday the story was the second top trend on Twitter as millions of people talked about it online. Samantha . was more discussed than James Murdoch quitting BSkyB, free ice cream . and all the other big news stories of the day and a spoof Twitter . account was also set up to poke fun at her. So what was it that got people so het up? BBC DJ Lauren Laverne posted a series of tweets about Samantha's article . Many of the comments alluded to Samantha's claim that women feel threatened by her. Speaking from her home in the Dordogne, France, Samantha . told the Mail: 'I'm not smug and I’m no flirt, yet over the years I've . been dropped by countless friends who felt threatened if I was merely in . the presence of their other halves. 'If their partners dared to actually . talk to me, a sudden chill would descend on the room. The Stylist magazine wrote a piece entitled 'We don't hate you Samantha Brick' in defence of the Daily Mail writer . She also said: 'While I’m no Elle . Macpherson, I'm tall, slim, blonde and, so I'm often told, a . good-looking woman. I know how lucky I am. 'But there are downsides to . being pretty — the main one being that other women hate me for no other . reason than my lovely looks.' These led to a strong of negative comments, but not all the reaction was against her. Figures show Samantha's story was the second top trending topic at one point today after 'Dear Nicki' India Andrews, from Los Angeles, California, said on MailOnline: 'You can't account for other people's reactions . to you. 'I'm smart, and I've intimidated people in a conversation . unintentionally many times or engendered jealousy in students during a . class unintentionally as well. 'Just live your life, and if someone tries . to get into your face about it, say ""okay"" and go about your life like . normal. 'Don't try to engage them in a conversation about it. My . experience is that you can't change their minds or their feelings.' In another of the best-rated comments, Alan Smyth, from Middlesbrough, said: 'Obviously a truly gorgeous person both . inside AND out. 'How sad to see the trolls sniping at her from 'neath . their gloomy bridges, they can NEVER touch her however! Sail on serenely . beautiful Ms Brick you deserve to laugh in the face of the jealous . beasts.' On Twitter, Sally Bercow, the reality TV star and the wife of Commons speaker John Bercow who is no stranger to being controversial herself, said sarcastically: 'I don't think I have had an Easter card. Ever. I bet Samantha Brick has had thousands...' BBC DJ Lauren Laverne posted a series of tweets about Samantha's article asking: 'Why do people WRITE articles lies this? And why am I reading it?' In an editorial entitled 'We don't hate you Samantha Brick' Stylist magazine also made its point. TV illusionist Derren Brown was one of a number of celebrities who took to Twitter after reading the story . It said: 'We believe Samantha Brick has had some unfortunate experiences with friends and colleagues, but this article is just another example of women attacking women - the very thing Samantha complains about. 'We're proud when our friends look their best and, we imagine, so are you. It's genuinely pleasant to watch a colleague light up when you compliment her skirt, or to walk into a room and see your closest friend looking just perfect. 'Think of the joy we all get from seeing a woman we love as a happy, sparkling bride. Let’s treat each other with generosity: let's celebrate.'","The Daily Mail writer provoked a strong reaction yesterday when she tried to explain why women they feel threatened by her, while men lust after her .

"Celebrity healer Vicky Vlachonis, left, is paying weekly 90-minute visits to Gwyneth Paltrow, left, and Chris Martin . They famously announced they  were ‘consciously uncoupling’, and now Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin have taken their very civilised separation to a new level by hiring  an ‘emotional guru’ to help ease the pain of their split. Celebrity healer Vicky Vlachonis, 39, who claims she helped Princes William and Harry deal with the aftermath of Princess Diana’s death, is paying weekly 90-minute visits to Paltrow and Martin to administer a range  of wacky treatments – including a ‘Morning Glory’ ritual, salt-and-pepper baths, ‘Tibetan Rites’ and ‘positive self-affirmation’ chanting. Greek-born Ms Vlachonis was introduced to Paltrow, 41, by fashion designer Stella McCartney 11 years ago and treats a host of stars including Leonardo DiCaprio, Elton John, Cameron Diaz and Katy Perry. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, she said: ‘We are extremely close. They are like family to me and I have been through so much with them. 'I visit their home every week for at least an hour and a half. I turn up with my table and we start by talking about what issues are going on in their lives. ‘I treat the whole family, including the children.’ She revealed: ‘I work on the whole body using techniques including acupuncture, reflexology, cupping. It’s about helping the family find balance. 'Emotional and physical pain are one and the same thing. My goal is to help people face their pain, learn what is causing it and then use the tools I give them to release that pain.’ Ms Vlachonis has introduced the couple to her ‘pain toolbox’, a set  of coping mechanisms which they follow ‘religiously’. First there is the ‘Morning Glory’ – a warm water and lemon drink designed to ‘flush out’ the liver. It is followed by a series of yoga poses called Tibetan Rites of Rejuvenation, and an all-over ‘body brush’ with a stiff-bristled brush aimed at stimulating the skin and draining the lymphatic system. The couple also follow the ‘Positive Feedback Program’ which includes chanting ‘self-affirming’ mantras such as ‘I am grateful for all  I have. I love my body. I give myself the gift of forgiveness and I am free’. Ms Vlachonis recommends a nightly soak of Epsom salts and black pepper oil, to ‘soak troubles away’. The healer, who moved to Los Angeles from London 18 months ago, adds: ‘I create a safe place where they can let go. It’s all about trust.’ Greek-born Ms Vlachonis, pictured, was introduced to Paltrow, 41, by fashion designer Stella McCartney 11 years ago . Ms Vlachonis has been dubbed the ‘Pain Gangster’ and ‘Vixster the Fixer’ by Paltrow. She treats the actress and Coldplay singer Martin, 37 – who split in March after ten years of marriage – at their two luxury properties in Los Angeles, a £6.2 million mansion in the exclusive Brentwood district and a new £8.2 million beachfront home in Malibu. Paltrow gushes about how Ms Vlachonis transformed her life in a foreword to the healer’s new book, The Body Doesn’t Lie, saying: ‘I’d been running fast, to put distance between myself and parts of my life I didn’t want to face, and Vicky made me slow to a jog until I came to understand that some emotions can never be outrun. ‘I had to stop, turn and face them so  I could work through the issues  and find peace.’ The actress adds that she often enjoys a ‘cleansing cry’ on the treatment table. ‘I can feel the ache and the sadness start to melt away. She understands that the pain almost always connects to the heart. She’s taught me to face pain, feel it and let it go.’ Recalling her meeting with the Princes, Ms Vlachonis said: ‘I went to see them in 1997 just after their mother died. It was an osteopathic treatment at the Palace to treat physical and emotional pain.’","Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin are being visited weekly by celebrity healer .

"Carl Froch and George Groves are expected to confirm within 24 hours that their grudge re-match will take place at Wembley. Assuming there are no last-minute hitches, this will be the first fight at the new stadium and the first to take place on the fabled turf this century. It is a thrilling prospect for the public and an historic occasion for the two fighters - but a brave, high-risk gamble by the promoter. VIDEO Scroll down for Groves and Froch's press conference . Part II: Carl Froch and George Groves are expected to confirm that their grudge re-match will be at Wembley . Scores to settle: Groves was desperate for another pop at Froch after impressing last time out . Not wrong! Sportsmail columnist Eddie Hearn (centre) promised an 'audacious' venue choice . 1963: Henry Cooper v Cassius Clay . Our ’Enery knocked Clay down in the fourth round with a vicious left hook, but through fair means or foul, trainer Angelo Dundee revived Clay. He won in the fifth. 1994: Lennox Lewis v Oliver McCall . Lewis was WBC heavyweight champion but suffered a shock second-round knockout. 1995: Frank Bruno v Oliver McCall . A year on from beating Lewis, McCall returned to Wembley but lost his title to Bruno on points. Eddie Hearn had promised ‘an audacious’ choice of arena for his May 31 spectacular. That, it certainly is. All the more so given the minimal amount of time Wembley will have to convert the stadium for boxing following England’s pre-World Cup warm-up game against Peru the previous evening. Wembley staff are on alert to work through the night but that will increase the cost of renting this already expensive site. Hearn is convinced that the excitement and controversy generated by the first fight – won by Froch with a somewhat premature stoppage after Groves had knocked him down and built a points lead – will galvanise a crowd approaching Wembley’s 90,000 capacity. If the attendance falls significantly short of that, in a venue this huge, he risks a drop in atmosphere as well as a fall in revenue. Not much time: Wembley would have just one day to prepare for the fight after England v Peru on May 30 . Under the weather: Froch controversially stopped Groves in the ninth round in November . Stopped: Many believe referee Howard Foster should have allowed the November fight to continue . Past records indicate the scale of the gamble. The biggest fight ever to take place in the old stadium was that in which Henry Cooper sat Cassius Clay briefly on his famous backside, 51 years ago this month. Yet despite the British public’s love affair with Our 'Enery and its fascination with the brash young American who would become The Greatest, it drew just 40,000 – Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor prominent among them. After Cooper retired and the nation transferred its affections to Frank Bruno, a gathering of similar size watched his failed attempt in the summer of 1986 to wrench the world heavyweight title from Tim Witherspoon. When Our Frank finally fulfilled his championship dream nine years later, by defeating Oliver McCall, there were only 23,000 in the stadium. Figures: Henry Cooper's bout against Cassius Clay drew a crowd of 40,000 at Wembley 51 years ago . Famous: Cooper sat The Greatest on his backside during the non-title fight . New hero: Frank Bruno attracted a similar crowd in 1986 when he lost against Tim Witherspoon . Missed opportunity? Ricky Hatton's fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr would have drawn record numbers . Support: Around 30,000 fans folowed Hatton and would've drawn plenty more fighting at home . Ricky Hatton, who was followed to his fights in America by an army of more than 30,000 fans, would surely have surpassed all those numbers had Floyd Mayweather not refused to leave his home comforts of Las Vegas. For big fights these days the media hype is more frenzied and there is more time to sell the event. Even so, a live gate of 60,000 would represent an enormous achievement by Hearn. Wembley became the front runner after Froch and Groves had vetoed each other’s preferred venues, respectively Nottingham Forest’s City Ground and Stamford Bridge, Chelsea. Two other stadia - Arsenal’s Emirates . and Cardiff’s roofed Millennium – were under consideration but Hearn . worked long and hard to pull off his Wembley coup. Under consideration: Arsenal's Emirates Stadium was thought of as a potential venue for the fight . No thanks! Groves vetoed Froch's preferred stadium - Nottingham Forest's City Ground . Another veto – that of England manager Roy Hodgson in refusing a proposal to shift the Peru date – has been overcome by Wembley calculating they can re-configure for boxing in no longer than 18 hours. The cheaper seats high in the stands are a considerable distance from the ring but the ‘I was there’ attraction of attending an occasion of such historic significance should help boost sales. The official announcement is scheduled to be made at Wembley at 11 am Tuesday morning by Sky, who will be broadcasting the fight on their pay-per-view Box Office channel. Elsewhere, Froch and Groves are already in training for their second world super-middleweight title slugfest. Amir Khan is unlikely to respond to Floyd Mayweather’s latest provocation by helping the American boost his pay-TV income from his May 3 fight with Marcos Maidana. Mayweather picked Maidana months after Khan was promised the fight of a lifetime if he waited for this spring date. Star appeal: Amir Khan will want to top his own bill . Now the world’s top pound-for-pound boxer has told Bolton’s former two-time world champion he can earn a September clash with him by appearing on his undercard. Mayweather tweeted a challenge to Khan to fight his friend and protegee Adrien Broner, saying he would fight the Englishman next ‘if you beat him, which you won’t.’ Maidana secured his Mayweather pay-night by beating Broner but it is by no means certain that an Argentine will prove a sizeable attraction to Hispanic viewers. Khan versus Broner would help sell the event. But unless Mayweather is prepared to sign the pre-contract this time, which is improbable, Khan will want to top his own bill this spring. Broner remains a potential opponent, along with Devon Alexander, Shawn Porter, Luis Collazo and a re-match with Lamont Peterson. The need for Anthony Joshua to step up in class was evident in his fifth quick KO victory – this one over a lumbering Hector Avila – on Saturday night. Awesome prospect:  Anthony Joshua (black trunks) was too strong for Hector Avila on Saturday . Britain’s Olympic super-heavyweight gold medallist is an awesome prospect but needs testing. To that end promoter Eddie Hearn is thinking of pitching him against one of two veteran British heavies – Matt Skelton or Michael Sprott – on the undercard of Scott Quigg’s world title fight on April 19. That looks like a sensible route towards a British title fight later this year.","A crowd of 60,000 could watch fight at Wembley Stadium on May 31 .

"Things have come a long way in the world of women's boxing. In 2009 more than 100 years after women's boxing first featured as a demonstration sport it was accepted as an Olympic sport. Today one quarter of Britain's 149,000 registered boxers are female and last year Flyweight Olympic champion Nicola Adams received an MBE. Scroll down for video . Ambreen is Britain's first Muslim female boxer and she says she has suffered serious prejudice . As Britain's first female Muslim boxer Ambreen Sadiq's story is especially impressive, but it is tinged with sadness as her passion for the sport has led to abuse and ridicule from the people who should support her most, her family. The 20-year-old is a former national champion and is so far unbeaten in the women's competition and yet despite her successes she says that she had to fight serious prejudice to get where she is today. Ambreen, from Keighley, Yorkshire, started boxing when she was suffering from racist bullying as a teenager and used it as a way of releasing her aggression. Although boxing helped the teenager feel calmer, her new hobby attracted a lot of negative attention and encouraged yet more bullying. In an interview with The Telegraph, Ambreen says that her immediate family were extremely supportive with her father and brother getting her interested in the sport, but her father's extended family were not happy. Ambreen at the age of 15 when her boxing career first took off . 'My dad's family are Pakistani Muslims and they're very into their community. It was all ""you're bringing shame into the culture"" because I'm an Asian Muslim girl. If I was a boy it wouldn't matter.' she told the Radhika Sanghani. Ambreen revealed that although she is not a strict practicing Muslim she says that the boxing dress code upset some family members as it went against traditional dress. 'I told them, I'm not going in to look sexy - it's a uniform. I even asked (the Amateur Boxing Association) to change it and let me wear tracksuit bottoms. But they said no. I have tried to change it' she said. Nicola Adams after winning Gold at the 2012 Olympics in London . In her interview she also revealed that she has been taunted by classmates and when her sister set up a Facebook group she even received death threats. Amazingly Ambreen has been able to rise above her bullies and has enjoyed an extremely successful start to her boxing career. At just 15 she was shortlisted for Junior Personality of the Year at the British Asian Sports Awards, and won the ABA Schoolgirls' National Championship. She has even featured in a Channel 4 Documentary called, The Girl Boxer. And now her story will be told on stage in a new play called No Guts, No Heart, No Glory to be shown at the Edinburgh Festival. Ambreen previously told the Daily Mail that she hopes to encourage other females to take part in the sport. 'I hope my success inspires more and more girls to take up boxing. If so, they may soon outnumber the boys.' Ambreen's coach Naz Jalil, added that she was blazing a trail for other Muslim girls who were interested in the sport. 'It's almost unheard of for an Asian Muslim girl to take up boxing but she is winning her uphill battle to prove that it is acceptable for females from her background to enter the ring.'

"A female prosecutor has turned the courthouse in a small Texas town into a fortress as she investigates who shot dead her boss, his wife and a co-worker in a series of planned attacks which some fear are the work of a violent white supremacist gang. Brandi Fernandez, 42, has surrounded the Kaufman County Law Enforcement Center with armed police officers after Mike . McLelland, the county's district attorney, and his wife Cynthia were shot dead at their home in Forney on Saturday. Miss Fernandez, backed by her boss Mr McLelland, was responsible for prosecuting a senior member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas last year who received two life terms following a shoot out. Scroll down for video . Courage: Brandi Fernandez, newly-named interim district attorney in Kaufman County, Texas has had security on high alert for all staff following the shooting . On guard: The Kaufman County Law Enforcement Center was protected by armed guards on Tuesday as the interim DA took up her position . Army veteran Mike McLelland, 63, and his 65-year-old wife, reportedly died from multiple gunshot wounds at their ranch set on one acre last weekend. Their violent deaths follow the gunning down of assistant district attorney Mark Hasse at the Kaufman courthouse parking lot on January 31. The investigations into their deaths was the primary concern of Miss Fernandez, named interim DA, as she slipped into the Kaufman County Courthouse for her first full day on Tuesday. Praised as a smart, tough litigator and a fierce advocate for child victims of crime, Fernandez declined to address reporters and remained under close protection inside the courthouse throughout the day. A police cruiser was parked outside her single-family home surrounded by trees on Monday and Tuesday. As first assistant district attorney under McLelland, Fernandez, 42, was named to the interim job on Monday, after having worked in the office for nearly a decade. Miss Fernandez began her role with the news that assistant DA Jay Hileman had walked off the large racketeering case  involving the Aryan Brotherhood on Tuesday. He reportedly sent a short email to the defense team on the case saying that he was stepping down for security reasons, according to Dallas News. A climate of fear has descended on Kaufman, an affluent town of around 7,000 people on the edge of Dallas' city limits, following the hits. Fears: District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were gunned down at their ranch-style bungalow in late March and their slaying was reportedly the inspiration for the hit that Canfield tried to arrange . Crime scene: The home of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland is surrounded by police tape after the 63-year-old and his wife Cynthia were shot dead on Saturday . The Aryan Brotherhood, a violent gang of 'generals' who often dictate orders from jail, is suspected of . being behind the assassinations. However no evidence has tied the . gang to the slayings and no one has been arrested over the deaths. The Aryan Brotherhood of Texas has been in the state's prison system since the 1980s, when it began as a white supremacist gang to retaliate against black and Latino gangs. It protected its members and ran illegal activities, including drug distribution, according to Terry Pelz, a former Texas prison warden and expert on the gang. The group, which has a long history of violence and retribution, is now believed to have more than 4,000 members in and out of prison who deal in a variety of criminal enterprises, including prostitution, robbery and murder. It has a paramilitary structure with five factions around the state. Each faction has a general, who is part of a steering committee known as the Wheel, which controls all criminal aspects of the gang, according to court papers. Four top leaders of the group were indicted in October for crimes ranging from murder to drug trafficking. At the time, prosecutors called the . indictments 'a devastating blow to the leadership' of the gang. Pelz . said the indictments might have fragmented the gang's leadership. Two months later, authorities issued the bulletin warning that the gang might try to retaliate against law enforcement for the investigation that also led to the arrest of 30 other members. Killing law enforcement representatives would be uncharacteristic of the group, Pelz said. 'They don't go around killing officials. They don't draw heat upon themselves,' he said. But Pelz, who worked in the Texas prison system for 21 years, said the gang has a history of threatening officials and of killing its own members or rivals. Dozens of federal agents have descended on Kaufman looking for answers. Kaufman police instigated a crackdown on the Brotherhood late last year with 34 alleged members arrested. The McLellands were murdered less than two weeks after Colorado's prison . chief was shot to death on his doorstep, allegedly by an ex-convict. Many members of the Texas legal community have increased . their security details. Harris . County District Attorney Mike Anderson now has round-the-clock . protection for him and his family after the assassinations. His district . includes Houston. Law . enforcement agencies throughout Texas have been on high alert, and steps . were being taken to better protect other DAs and their staffs. Anderson said he also would take precautions at his office, the largest of its kind in Texas, with more than 270 prosecutors. 'I think district attorneys across Texas are still in a state of shock,' Anderson said on Sunday. Mr McLelland, 63, was the 13th prosecutor . killed in the U.S. since the 1960s. Kaufman . County Sheriff David Byrnes said there was nothing to indicate for certain . whether the murders were connected to Mr Hasse's shooting. In Colorado, sheriff's spokesman Sergeant Joe Roybal said . investigators had so far found no evidence connecting the Texas killings . to the Colorado case, but added: 'We're examining all possibilities.' Colorado's . corrections director Tom Clements was killed on March 19 when he . answered the doorbell at his home outside Colorado Springs. Evan . Spencer Ebel, a white supremacist and former Colorado inmate suspected . of shooting Clements, died in a shootout with Texas deputies two days . later about 100 miles from Kaufman. In . an interview shortly after the Colorado slaying, Mr McLelland raised . the possibility that Mr Hasse was gunned down by a white supremacist . gang. McLelland, elected in 2010, said his . office had prosecuted several cases against such gangs, particularly one . known as the Aryan Brotherhood. The . groups have a strong presence around Kaufman County, a mostly rural . area dotted with subdivisions, with a population of about 104,000. After Hasse's slaying, Mr McLelland said that he carried a gun everywhere around town even when walking his dog. He . figured assassins were more likely to try to attack him outside. He . said he had warned all his employees to be constantly on the alert. 'The . people in my line of work are going to have to get better at it,' he . said of dealing with the danger, 'because they're going to need it more . in the future.' Sleepy suburbs: Kaufman, a town of 7,000 people on the edge of Dallas, has been rocked by rumors that the Aryan Brotherhood is putting hits on law enforcers .

"Two British soldiers are believed to have committed suicide in Afghanistan yesterday, taking the number of British fatalities for the week to four. The names of the servicemen have yet to be released by the Ministry of Defence, but next of kin have been informed. One of the men was from the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers based at Camp Bastion, the UK headquarters in Helmand province. Prince Harry is based at the UK headquarters in Afghanistan, where a soldier died from a suspected suicide . A second serviceman is thought to have shot himself a few miles away from the base. Defence sources say an investigation has been launched into the suspected Camp Bastion suicide, the camp at which Prince Harry is based - it is not thought to be the result of hostile action. The Ministry of Defence said the . soldier was a member of 104 Force Support Battalion and was attached to 4 . Close Support Battalion, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers . (REME). Lieutenant Colonel . Richard Parry, spokesman for Joint Force Support (Afghanistan), said: . ‘It is with deep sadness that I must report the death of a soldier from 4 . Close Support Battalion, REME, at Camp Bastion, Helmand Province. ‘The . condolences of all personnel serving with Joint Force Support .

"Ben's abusers used his phone to contact him and his parents only discovered the abuse by overhearing a phone call . Your child being abused is every parents worst nightmare, but for one couple, it was happening right under their nose in their own home. Ben was just 13 when he became the victim of online grooming and ultimately sexual abuse by four adult men. His parents, increasingly concerned about his reclusive behaviour, only discovered what was happening when they overheard a late night phone call between Ben and his abusers. What followed is a harrowing tale of not only unwinding the psychological control the groomers had over their son, but a struggle to get support and to see the abusers convicted. Speaking through actors to protect their identity, they have decided to share their story with charity the Marie Collins Foundation (MCF), the only children’s charity in the UK devoted to helping children and their families who have suffered online sexual abuse and exploitation. 'We became aware that there was a problem with our son he was very unhappy towards the end of 2010,' Ben's mother explains. 'He'd come out as being gay on Facebook in the summer of 2010 and the months following that he was very very unhappy, very unsettled. We put it down to the fact that he was struggling with his sexuality. We knew that something had changed dramatically in our son and the school wasn't picking up on it. 'We his parents didn't see it, the doctor didn't see it. 'He'd completely stopped talking to us, there was no communication going on at all but i was listening and watching all the time.' Powerless to do anything, they were forced to simply stand by as the son they knew disappeared before their eyes. It was not until January 2011 that the true horror of what was happening to Ben was exposed. 'We were in bed one night and I could hear him talking in his room. 'I got up and could clearly hear him saying ""I will get the train"", and I could hear a man's voice on his phone. A third of 9-19 year olds who go online at least once a week report having received unwanted sexual (31 per cent) or nasty (33 per cent) comments via e-mail, chat, IM (instant messenger) or text message, according to a study from the London School of Economics. Only 7 per cent of parents or carers think their child have received such comments. 'And i knew then, i knew immediately that he was being groomed.' Shocked, and unsure of what to do, they decided to call the police, who initially said they were unable to help, forcing them to involve the school, who in turn called in Social Services. Ben's mother recalls: 'They told our son that I had heard the conversation. It was dreadful, he wouldn't speak to us . 'Social Services said they'd need his phone. Two local policemen arrived and wrestled our son to the ground and took his phone. 'It was the most harrowing thing i have ever seen, he ended up in a corner sobbing. 'All he wanted was to have his phone back because one of the groomers had taken over his mind so much he couldn't bare to be out of contact with him. 'Earlier in that day i also found pictures of him on his laptop that he had taken of himself, naked images. 'A safeguarding officer spoke to our son privately and came out and told us our son had been involved sexually with four men. 'Our world completely collapsed.' There have been few studies into the level of online grooming and subsequent sexual abuse . Ben's mother and her husband were catapulted into an entirely unknown world as the police attempted to bring charges against the men and they attempted to unravel how their son had been groomed to meet up with paedophiles under their nose. Ben was given weekly support from social services, but his mother and father became increasingly frustrated with the slow pace of police prosecution. 'We knew the name and whereabouts of one of the men who had abused him, but he wasn't arrested until seven months later,' they explain. 'All through that year people we knew, and the police knew, to be paedophiles were left to roam. There were months between knowledge of these people and arrests, and then even longer before any charges were filed.' Ben is still in contact with social services as the family attempt to rebuild their lives. Although some of the men responsible for his abuse have been sent to jail, trials continue for others. Ben's mother explains: 'It is a question of time, consistency and appreciating the deep psychological damage that gets done.' Tink Palmer, chief executive of the Marie Collins Foundation, who have supported the family, explains that, sadly, Ben's story is not unique. 'Currently, both within the UK and internationally, the response to the needs of the child victims and their families is ad hoc and, in the main, does not take into account the particular differential impacts that such abuse has on those who are targeted. our vision is to improve services for victims and their families. 'Very few studies have been carried out regarding the number of children who are abused through grooming online, the nature of such grooming and its impact on the victims. In addition, our understanding of children’s risky behaviours online and the impact on their emotional development needs expanding. 'Because of its perceived characteristics (anonymity, speed) the internet and mobile technologies will be welcomed conduits for abuse by those wishing to sexually harm children. 'The charity  have announced a groundbreaking partnership with BT to pilot a new programme that will eventually train all front-line workers to help children harmed in this way.' ** Names in this story have been changed to protect identities** .","Ben was groomed online by a group of paedophiles .

"Joe Calzaghe is preparing to take his place in boxing's Hall of Fame in expectation of George Groves succeeding him as Britain's latest world super-middleweight champion. The Welsh maestro, who retired undefeated after a stellar career, goes to America for his ultimate individual honour immediately after the mega rematch at Wembley between Groves and Carl Froch. Calzaghe will be among the record 80,000 crowd at the national stadium on Saturday week to watch the two aspirants to his throne resolve their bitter dispute following the controversy of Froch's stoppage win last November. Defiant: Joe Calzaghe insists he will not come out of retirement to face the winner of Carl Froch vs George Groves . Rematch: Carl Froch (left) and George Groves (right) will face each other for a second time on May 31 . The animosity between Froch and Calzaghe as they vie for their place in ring history is well documented, but the man who retired undefeated did his best to set that aside as he weighed up the prospects for Wembley. First, Calzaghe insisted that he would refuse to come back to face the winner, even for one hundred million dollars. Although he did say: 'Maybe if I'd been even a couple of years younger than I am now, at 42, I would have considered beating either of them. But not now. I wouldn't risk my legacy.' Then he ran the rule over the fight which is capturing the imagination of the British public and promising to galvanise massive interest in boxing in Britain. He said: 'You can make a case for both Carl and George. Has Froch become too old? Has Groves improved enough? 'To begin with it's ironic for me to think that George was born in the same hospital as me in Hammersmith, west London, just a few years later. 'Is youth on his side? Well, you have to ask yourself if Carl can improve on the first fight as he is coming up to 37. But then again, can George follow up from his surprising performance in that one and go one better? 'The issue hangs around whether Groves is a 12-round fighter. Not everyone has that distance in them. Carl has because, like me, we should've been 15-round men. Last time out: Groves connects with a left hand during his stoppage defeat to Froch . Controversial: Referee Howard Foster stopped Groves from continuing in Manchester in November last year . 'It's a question of the stamina. Froch still appears to have the cardiovascular capacity to go any distance. I expect we're going to find that out about George. 'Froch is beginning to look like he's slowing up but then he will take Groves more seriously this time. Groves is faster but does he have the steam for a long fight? 'In the end I look at it and think that George, with his backing-off style, would've been more of a problem for me if I ever thought of coming back to meet one of them. So if push comes to shove I'd go for him. 'Although in my own mind I believe that in my prime I would've beaten either of them, James DeGale, who I think can give them both a lot of trouble, and Andre Ward, who is similar to Bernard Hopkins, but who I got the better of.' Calzaghe . happily agrees that Froch-Groves II is good for British boxing and will . generate renewed fascination with the hard old game. But ask him who he . admires most of all throughout his half-a-lifetime involved in the ring . and he says: 'Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Tommy Hearns and Roberto . Duran. They were involved in great fights against each other.' Legend: Calzaghe (second from left) is set to be inducted into boxing's Hall of Fame in June . Hagler . is the pick of the bunch, who since marvellous Marvin always attends . the Hall of Fame ceremony, he is looking forward to making his . acquaintance for the first time in the first week in June. Calzaghe said: 'I've had the pleasure of meeting Sugar Ray several times but never Hagler and I can't wait.' He was talking at a Boxing Writers’ Club lunch in London which he recalls was held in the same restaurant in which he announced his signing for legendary manager/promoter Mickey Duff 21 years ago. Although he knows he could still make a fortune from driving himself out of retirement to face Froch or Groves - albeit not as much as one hundred million dollars - he says: 'I always promised I would stay retired and I will. It is a great honour for me to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. It’s very emotional for me and my father Enzo, who was the perfect trainer for me. ‘If I were to risk my place in history by coming back too late and sacrificing my unbeaten record then, never mind the money, I'd be miserable for the rest of my life.' Froch-Groves II will be televised live on May 31 on Sky Sports Box Office.","Calzaghe believes he would have been too good for both Froch and Groves .

The Game Boy emulator recreates the handset on users' screens and allows them to play 13 games including Mario Land, Tetris and Space Invaders. Simply open the page on an Android or iPhone device in order to play. All the game requires is a touchscreen in order to use the buttons, which means it cannot be played on a PC. Created by Ben Midi it uses the same controls as the original console, but adapted for use on a smartphone touchscreen. Available for Android or iPhone handsets, it can be played in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing gamers more room to use the buttons. It is not known if Nintendo is aware of the website. However other retro game emulators are popular online, with Android users able to buy apps which replicate the Atari, the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Game Boy Advance. The Game Boy was released in 1989 in America and Japan and was immensely popular, selling 87million units worldwide. On its release in the United States the entire first shipment, containing millions of units, sold out within weeks of arriving. Modern-day iPhones have roughly 650 times the processing power of the first Game Boy to be released. Scroll down for video .

"A popular photo-sharing website owned by Facebook has told users it now owns the rights to their pictures. Instagram will not give any warning or payment before cashing in on the images posted on its site. It means pictures by children as young as 13 could be sold to advertisers. People whose photos have been taken by Instagram users risk finding their image published without their knowledge. 'Did we mention its free?' Except Instagram's new terms of service makes clear that users grant the company rights over all their photos and personal information uploaded to the site . The new policy will operate from the middle of January under changes to terms and conditions announced yesterday. Instagram’s 30million global users cannot opt out and must close their accounts to maintain control over their images. The change does not affect users of Facebook, which bought Instagram for £616million in April. The new terms make clear that users effectively hand over the rights to their pictures and personal information in exchange for ‘free’ access to Instagram. Its website now reads: ‘You agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos ... in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.’ Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg: His company bought out Instagram in a $715million deal in September . The site also updated its privacy settings to share information about its users with Facebook as well as with other affiliates and advertisers. Instagram says users must be at least 13 years old to sign up for the service. But the new rules assume that when an underage teenager signs up, a parent or guardian is aware that their child’s image, username and photos might be used in adverts. The shake-up was described as a ‘disgusting’ and ‘egregious’ breach of privacy yesterday. Nick Pickles, of campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘People thought they were Instagram’s customers, but in reality users are Instagram’s product. It goes to show when respecting people’s data and privacy come into conflict with profit, there’s only ever going to be one winner.’ Instagram said the changes will make it easier to integrate with Facebook. If . Instagram's new terms of service are tough for your to swallow, there . is a quick way to remove yourself from the service - and save all your . pictures. First . you need to download all the pictures you have handed over to the app. Wired Gadget Lab recommends using Instaport, which will download your . entire library in just a few minutes. Once your photos have been rescued, you can upload them to another photo-sharing service with less invasive terms like Flickr. Once your photos have been removed, its time to delete your account - but bear in mind that once it's gone, it's gone forever. Instagram . will not reactivate delected accounts and you will never again be able . to sign up to the service with the same user name. ‘This means we can do things like fight spam more effectively, detect system and reliability problems more quickly, and build better features for everyone by understanding how Instagram is used,’ it said. It came as Simon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, told a Commons committee that ministers shouldn’t introduce tough laws surrounding the use of data. ‘Our services are free to users but they don’t cost us nothing. We have to pay for it and the way we pay for that is advertising and that involves innovative use of the data people provide to us,’ he said yesterday. Instagram launched in 2010 and allows users to share on Twitter and Facebook images they have taken with digital devices including iPhones. The app configures photos to produce a square shape similar to the Polaroid images of the 1970s. There are 11 filters that can produce a ‘retro’ look. Instagram no longer allows Twitter users to view its photographs in tweets in an effort to drive more people away from the rival social media company to its own website. Kevin Systrom, CEO of the photo-sharing service, which was snapped up by Facebook earlier this year, said Instagram has turned off support for 'Twitter cards,' signalling a deepening rift between two of the web's biggest brands. Twitter users started to complain earlier this month in public messages that Instagram photos were not displaying properly on Twitter's website. Clarifying the situation, Mr Systrom released a statement saying: 'We believe the best experience is for us to link back to where the content lives.' Instagram started off as a smartphone application-only service but has recently improved its website. 'A handful of months ago, we supported Twitter cards because we had a minimal web presence,' Mr Systrom said, noting that the company has since released new features that allow users to comment about and 'like' photos directly on Instagram's website. The rivalry between Facebook and Twitter intensified in April when the former outbid Twitter to nab fast-growing Instagram in a cash-and-stock deal valued at the time at $1billion. Facebook is developing its own in-house equivalent to Snapchat, the controversial photo messaging app that has been accused of promoting 'sexting' among youngsters. Snapchat allows users to send pictures with a time limit - meaning that they automatically delete themselves after a predetermined time has elapsed. The messaging service has reportedly become popular for sending flirtatious pictures, with recipients unable to hang on to the embarrassing evidence and leak it online. However, it has come under fire for promising more privacy than it can guarantee, since it remains possible to take a screengrab of the picture before it self destructs. Facebook, the world's most popular social network, reportedly plans to launch its own Snapchat-like service in the coming weeks, before the end of the year. The new app will be standalone and separate from the main Facebook app, bringing the social network's app count up to five.","Instagram's new terms of service and privacy policy bring it into line with those of parent company Facebook .

"Crimea annexed by the Kremlin, the rest of Ukraine at risk as Russian troops mass on its borders… . It is not as if the world’s leaders do not have enough real-life international problems to keep them busy. Nevertheless, with the crisis deepening in the east, Barack Obama, David Cameron, Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping ended up playing a computer game dubbed  ‘nukes on the loose’ at a conference this week. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and Barack Obama, along with other world leaders, played a game called nukes on the loose in which they were asked about their response to a fake nuclear crisis . Obama and Cameron were joined by other world leaders for the Nuclear Security Summit yesterday . The two-day summit was convened to discuss the threat nuclear weapons pose to the world . The war game, the brainchild of the Dutch hosts of the Nuclear Security Summit (NSS) meeting in The Hague, revolves around a terrorist network planning to launch a ‘dirty bomb’ in a  high-profile financial centre. ‘It could be the City of London, or Wall Street, Milan or anywhere,’ the 53 world leaders at the NSS were told. The game, split across four three-minute videos, involves terrorists stealing nuclear material from an unidentified country which has not properly secured its stockpile. They use uranium to build a bomb which could kill millions of people if unleashed. With the clock ticking, Mr Cameron and his fellow leaders – each playing the game on touch screen computers – had to figure out what to do. Asked about the threat Russia poses to world security, Obama said he was more worried about a rogue attack . David Cameron held discussions with UN Secretary general Ban Ki Moon during the summit at the Hague . After each video, they made their decision from four options and the answers were shared anonymously with the group  for discussion. The leaders were reported to have enjoyed the video game and President Obama even told delegates that the US regularly performs similar exercises. He had America’s top adviser on weapons of mass destruction, Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, at his side during the game but the other leaders were alone. However, among all the excitable men, there was at least one  leader who raised an eyebrow at the proceedings. German Chancellor Merkel was said to . have been apprehensive taking part in a role-playing game about such a . serious issue, especially alone, whereas in real life she would have . advisers. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was said to be slightly out of her depth during the video games because she was without her usual advisers . But while she normally plays hardball in negotiations, in this case she was talked around. The . summit’s Dutch organisers said it was the first time they had tried . anything like this, but felt the ‘interactive approach’ was successful . and the participants were ‘enthusiastic’. NSS spokesman Frank Wassenaar said it was a ‘fictitious but realistic scenario’ and the right outcome was achieved by countries working together. ‘It was quite innovative and not the convention in a summit like this,’ he added. ‘Usually the leaders of delegations just make a statement. [But] the leaders debated freely.’ A diplomatic source told The Daily Telegraph that the nukes video game was actually a tough test for leaders. ‘It put them on the spot,’ said the source. ‘Should they inform the public or keep them in the dark?

"Beyond: Two Souls is a lacklustre videogame. But it’s still an entertaining, if flawed, interactive movie. For what it lacks in gameplay, it makes up for in (mostly) wonderful cinematography, action-packed (if sometimes over-the-top) set pieces, and a mesmerising performance from Ellen Page. Written and directed by David Cage – the man who penned the acclaimed Heavy Rain and Fahrenheit – you ‘play’ Jody Holmes (Page), a girl possessed by a spirit she calls Aiden, who has a variety of powers at his disposal. Enjoyable: there are plenty of plot holes and Cage's writing is heavy-handed at times, but Beyond still entertains . Plot bounces back and forward in time uncomfortably. One minute you're reliving key events from Jody’s upbringing - and her relationship with Dr Nathan Dawkins (voiced by Willem Defoe). The next you're at the centre of an all-action, Jason Bourne-inspired chase scene. Thankfully, for what Beyond lacks in coherent plot, it makes up for by Page’s performance. At its heart, the game revolves around Jody’s relationship with Aiden – and it is the earlier, quieter sequences (especially a party scene), that are both the most memorable and the most effective at driving the interplay between the two home. Interestingly, it’s during these moments that the lack of any real gameplay doesn’t seem to matter as much. As in Heavy Rain, player interaction is reduced to button prompts and manipulating the sticks to mimic an on-screen movement. Sadly, this system is just too passive for the game’s more action-orientated scenes. Quick-Time Events are incredibly rigid, and often have the same outcome if no buttons are pressed. The ability to use Aiden is also far too scripted. He’s not available all the time, and can only possess certain souls. Indeed, it forces you down a certain path with such uncompromising force that it reaffirms suggestions that Cage may be a frustrated movie director at heart. Flawed: during the Quick Time events, often doing nothing will not really affect the outcome . Although there are multiple endings, all of Jody’s choices feel insignificant compared to the life or death decisions in Heavy Rain. Environments, although technically masterful, are all smoke and mirrors – offering very little depth in exploration, bar the odd object to pick up and examine. Facial animations are wonderful, though, detailed enough to depict even the most intricate of emotions. Go into Beyond as an experience, not a game, and you’ll enjoy the ride. But be warned… it’s a bumpy one. Beyond: Two Souls is out Friday October 11. Agree with Talal?

"Floyd Mayweather has confirmed how wise Amir Khan is not to fall for the bait of appearing on the great man’s undercard after being dumped from the big fight itself. At his first media conference since announcing Marcos Maidana as his opponent in Las Vegas on May 3, the world’s pound-for-pound king has made this very clear: ‘I choose who I want to fight, when I want.’ Mayweather had tried to goad Khan into fighting his protegee Adrien Broner that night, hinting that he would give our young man from Bolton his big-bucks shot if he won. Announcement: Floyd Mayweather will fight Marcos Maidana on May 3 at MGM Grand in Las Vegas . While that would have boosted Mayweather’s pay-per-view revenue, Khan nursed serious doubts that he would be Floyd Jnr’s next Chosen One come September, win or lose against Broner. After all, one promise had already been broken. So Khan, having lost almost a year waiting for God in gloves, will go his own way this spring. Perhaps as early as this week, he will name a comeback opponent and a date. That will not be Kell Brook in the UK, either, since that would not improve his chances of ever fighting Mayweather. Khan is looking for a marquee win in America. Mayweather, meanwhile, continues to exercise his box-office power over his sport. In the pipeline: Amir Khan is looking for a marquee win in America, not a British showdown with Kell Brook . Does what he wants: Mayweather ignored his own poll about who to fight next . That privilege has been hard won but by hand-picking the likes of Maidana – whose rough-hewn style is likely to suit him – he risks accusations of evading rivals who might have the speed to pose a different problem. ‘I don’t duck anyone,’ says Mayweather. Personally, since he is the best in the world and knows it, I believe him. But we are approaching the point where he may have to prove it. If, next month, Manny Pacquiao avenges that scandalous decision given to Tim Bradley the pressure will crank up yet again for the long-deferred super-fight between the PacMan and the Money Man. Mayweather, having instigated his . Twitter poll asking fans to vote whether he should fight Khan or . Maidana, then ignored the result. But at some point, for credibility’s sake, he may have to let the public choose his opponent for him. Different paths: Khan rejected the chance to fight on Adrien Broner on Mayweather's undercard . Warrior: Maidana pushed Khan all the way when they fought in Las Vegas in 2010 . The Cinammon Kid made a tasty comeback at the weekend. Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez served up a timely reminder that no boxer should be consigned to the slops bucket just because he loses the odd fight. What matters is how he responds to that setback when he returns to the ring. Back with a bang: Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez beat Alfredo Angulo on Saturday in Las Vegas . Alvarez, having been bewildered last September by Floyd Mayweather’s most recent master class, resurfaced in Las Vegas with a dynamic performance against a fellow Mexican considered so dangerous that he revels in the nickname El Perro – The Dog. Alfredo Angulo never got close to putting the bite on Canelo, despite a couple of quibbles nagging at the event. In an echo of Froch-Groves 1, the referee was booed for a tenth round stoppage which many in the crowd at the MGM Grand Garden arena deemed premature. Just as the British Boxing Board of Control backed their official Howard Foster, so the Nevada State Athletic Commission is defending Tony Weeks. Although Alvarez was well behind on the cards, in contrast to George Groves who was leading Carl Froch, the argument was similar: Do we want one punch too few, or one punch too many? It is a fine line which the referees have to tread but, in principle, better to stop it a mite early than end up in hospital later that night. Less acceptable was Canelo’s failure to make the light-middleweight limit. He said he could have squeezed off the extra poundage had it been a title fight but really that only made it more cynical. Too many boxers are hitting the scales too heavy these days and that in itself hints at another medical risk. Rather than dehydrate to make the weight, shouldn’t they be moving up to a more natural division? The consolation for Angulo was that he picked up an extra $100,000 deducted from the Alvarez purse. Nevertheless, Canelo made a statement as important for boxing as for himself. Most champions are defined by how they come back from losing their titles. The great boxers of the past, with such rare exceptions as Rocky Marciano and Joe Calzaghe, had defeats on their records, Muhammad Ali , Joe Louis and the two Sugar Rays, Robinson and Leonard, among them. Response: Alvarez bounced back from his disappointing loss to Mayweather by beating Angulo . Yet of late it has become a crime to lose a fight. That misconception keeps growing the longer Mayweather - 45-0 and counting - goes without suffering his first defeat. Canelo, fully restored now to world title contention, has dished up a powerful defence against that nonsense. Expect Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan to do the same, shortly. Carl Frampton – anointed by his coach the great Barry McGuigan as his successor to the throne of Ulster boxing – has been given added incentive to win his world title eliminator against Hugo Cazares in Belfast next month. Leo Santa Cruz, after impressively retaining his WBC super-bantamweight crown against former champion Cristian Mijares in Las Vegas on Saturday night, pronounced himself eager to do the same against Frampton. That would appear to put Frampton just one victory away from his first world title bid, possibly at a sold-out stadium in Belfast in September. If so, it should be an Irish cracker. Clash: Carl Frampton (left) could be just one fight away from a crack at WBC champion Leo Santa Cruz (right) When Muhammad Ali came to Newcastle in 1977 he struck up a friendship with a Geordie fan which endures to this day. The Greatest never forgot the courtesy and attention he received from Russell Routledge when he visited Tyneside to have his marriage to former wife Veronica blessed at a local mosque. The pair kept in touch and three years later Ali not only invited Routledge to meet him in Los Angeles but invited him to stay at his mansion. Ovation: Former world heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali touches down in Newcastle in 1977 . Geordie nation: A young admirer gives Ali a kiss on his arrival in Newcastle . Much more recently, Routledge travelled from Newcastle to be a guest at Ali’s 70th birthday dinner in Louisville. That relationship offers a touching insight into the caring side of Ali’s nature and now Routledge has put pen to paper for a new book. By his own admission, Routledge is not a writer but this memoir adds a different dimension to the Ali story and is worth the read. *Muhammad Ali – Tyneside 1977.

"Celtic are in the hunt for Senegal international Kara Mbodj, who plays for Alex McLeish’s Belgian side Racing Genk. The Parkhead side will be looking for reinforcements in the January transfer window after a stuttering start to Ronny Deila’s first season in charge. And 25-year-old Mbodj, who can play as a defender or a holding midfielder, is one of the names being targeted. Celtic are in the hunt for Senegal international Kara Mbodj, who plays for Alex McLeish’s side Racing Genk . But Celtic are expected to face competition for his signature from south of the border, with Barclays Premier League clubs Crystal Palace and West Ham United also credited with an interest in the 25-year-old. Deila knows Mbodj well after he played for Norwegian side Tromso for two years, with the Celtic boss encountering him on numerous occasions when he was in charge of Stromsdgodset. Mbodj said: ‘I can confirm that British clubs are showing interest in me. ‘But I don’t want this to distract from my focus which is to get Genk as high up the league as possible. Ronny Deila is looking for some defensive cover and Mbodj can play in both defence and holding midfield . ‘In January we will talk to these clubs and I will make a decision on my future then.’ Mbodj has helped transform McLeish’s side from relegation contenders to European place hopefuls in the Belgian Pro League - and it’s that form that will see Celtic look closely at the talented African. Meanwhile, midfielder Stefan Johansen has apologised to Celtic fans for the 2-1 defeat to Dundee United at Tannadice and says the Scottish champions will make Ross County pay in their next league match. The 25-year-old has scored once in his 12 appearances for the Senegalese senior side . With Deila’s men hosting Jim McIntyre’s struggling Highlanders at Parkhead on Saturday, Norwegian international Johansen said: ‘Good teams bounce back right away so we will just focus on training well and focus on that game - because we want to get back on the winning run. ‘Ross County always try to defend and then counter attack, but if we do our own things well enough, then we should beat them and that’s what we have to focus on. ‘The fans were fantastic at Tannadice and it was a joy to play in front of them so I’d like to say sorry we couldn’t win.’","Celtic are in the hunt for Senegal international Kara Mbodj .

"Ill patients who dial 999 for an ambulance are increasingly being sent police cars or taxis instead. One ambulance service has seen a staggering 350 per cent increase in the use of taxis to pick up patients in three years. It comes as ministers announced how £250million would be used in the most stretched A&Es to prevent a crisis in the NHS this winter. Ambulance trusts are using taxis, police cars and firefighters to take patients to hospital, the Commons heard . Figures obtained under Freedom of Information laws by Labour reveal that in 2012-13 158 taxis attended 999 calls in the South Western Ambulance Service area. In 2009-10 the number was just 35. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham also warned police cars were being used on a daily basis to ferry patients to hospital. In another area an ambulance service is using retained firefighters to attend calls. The warning about the crisis in the NHS comes as new figures showed freezing temperatures last winter led to 31,000 extra deaths, in England and Wales. It marked a 29 per cent increase on the previous year. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today announced details of how an extra £250 million for struggling A&E units will be spent this winter. It includes almost 2,500 extra beds the equivalent of almost 3,000 extra staff. Labour's Andy Burnham (left) revealed the growing reliance on taxis to take patients to hospital, as Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced how funding would be spent on more nurses and beds this winter . Freezing temperatures last winter led to 31,000 deaths, new figures show. The number of 'excess winter deaths' in England and Wales rose by dramatically by 29 per cent compared with the previous year. Campaigners condemned the figures as a 'national scandal'. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the majority of the excess deaths were among pensioners - with over-75s accounting for 25,600 winter-related deaths in 2012-13. Temperatures plunged across Britain at the start of this year, with March the coldest record since 1962 with an average monthly temperature of just 2.6C (36.7F).The ONS said: 'The number of deaths peaked in the first week of January, which coincided with a peak in rates of influenza-like illness over the Christmas weeks. 'The mean number of daily deaths was higher than average for a prolonged period between February and April 2013.' More women died as a result of the cold (18,000) compared to 13,100 men. But in the Commons he was challenged over . the increasing reliance of over-stretched ambulance services on other . vehicles to take patients to hospital. Mr Burnham claimed that as A&Es fill up, ambulances become ‘trapped’ and unable to handover patients. He urged Mr Hunt to take action now to avoid the ambulance hold-ups ‘engulfing’ other emergency services. Mr Burnham told the Commons: ‘Today I want to put to you new evidence that the A&E crisis is deepening and having a serious knock-on effect on ambulance services. ‘Information from police forces reveals that police cars having to ferry patients to A&E is far more widespread than people realise and in some areas happening on a daily basis. ‘One ambulance service is now using retained firefighters to attend calls but this is how bad things have got - another ambulance service has seen a 350 per cent increase in the number of 999 calls attended by taxis. ‘Do you think it's ever acceptable that when a patient dials 999 a taxi turns up instead?’ But Mr Hunt accused his shadow of . talking up a crisis that is not happening and said the coalition was . hitting its targets, unlike the last Labour administration when Mr . Burnham was health secretary. Mr . Hunt replied: ‘I'm afraid this is utterly irresponsible. We are hitting . our A&E target, we are hitting our ambulance standard. When you . were health secretary you missed the ambulance standard for October, . November, December and January. ‘What . you are doing is trying to talk up a crisis that isn't happening and . you should think about people on the front line and just for once put . patients before politics.’ Mr Burnham suggested that the country would have heard Mr Hunt's ‘complacency’ and warned large parts of the country did not have adequate ambulance cover. He told the Health Secretary: ‘You didn't condemn the use of taxis. I'll tell you now, it's unacceptable but it's happening on your watch and why? ‘Because ambulances are trapped at A&Es, unable to hand over patients. This means 999 response times are getting worse and large swathes of the country right now are without adequate ambulance cover. ‘Isn't it time you were honest with the public, admitted the scale of the crisis facing the NHS this winter and took action now to prevent it engulfing other emergency services?’","South Western Ambulance trust sees 350% increase in use of taxis .

"Google waded into Russia's gay-rights row as the Winter Games in Sochi launched today by updating its iconic search page logo to depict athletes skiing, sledding, curling and skating against a rainbow-colored backdrop. The rainbow flag has been a symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender pride since the 1970s. The company declined to comment on the new Google Doodle that appeared on its home pages worldwide, saying it wanted the illustration to speak for itself. But the logo clearly was meant as a show of support for gay rights and a rebuke of the law that bans pro-gay 'propaganda' that could be accessible to minors. Below the updated logo appears a two-sentence section of the Olympic charter that reads, in part, 'The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practicing sport, without discrimination of any kind.' Scroll down to watch police arrest a small group of LGBT rights activists . Strong statement: The company declined to comment on the new Google Doodle that appeared on its home pages worldwide, saying it wanted the illustration to speak for itself . 'Google has made a clear and unequivocal statement that Russia's anti-LGBT discrimination is indefensible,' said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, whose Washington-based group has been lobbying American corporations, especially those sponsoring the Games in Sochi, to condemn the law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in July. It went on: 'Now it's time for each and every remaining Olympic sponsor to follow their lead. The clock is ticking, and the world is watching.' Although Google is not an Olympics sponsor, its action came a day after three sponsors of the U.S. Olympic Committee - AT&T, DeVry University and yogurt maker Chobani - issued statements explicitly speaking out against the Russian law. Carefully-timed: Google's timing meant it would be seen in Russia today, when the Games' opening ceremonies will be held. The local time in Sochi is 12 hours ahead of California, where Google is headquartered (pictured) Protest: Activist Ann Northrop is joined by demonstrators from Queer Nation, and others who oppose the Russian government¿s continued attacks on human rights, including the rights of LGBT Russians, as she pours fake blood on an Olympic flag in New York . Google typically updates its themed daily Doodles at midnight Eastern time, but the Olympics-gay pride version made its debut in the late afternoon. While Google is not as popular in Russia as it is in the U.S., the timing meant it would be seen in Russia on Friday, when the Games' opening ceremonies will be held. The local time in Sochi is 12 hours ahead of California, where Google is headquartered. Google and its founders have been outspoken supporters of gay rights since 2008, when the company got involved in the campaign to defeat a gay marriage ban on the California ballot. Fury: They are angry over a law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in July bans pro-gay 'propaganda' that could be accessible to minors . Restrictive: Critics say the law is so restrictive that it forbids almost any public expression of support for gay rights . In 2012 it launched a global workplace safety campaign, called 'Legalise Love,' that it described as a call to decriminalize homosexuality and eliminate homophobia around the world. A public kiss between two men could be defined as illegal 'homosexual propaganda' and bring a fine of up to £10,000 if the bill that comes up for a first vote this month becomes law in Russia. The legislation being pushed by the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church would make it illegal to tell minors information that is defined as ‘propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality and transgenderism.’ It includes a ban on holding public events that promote gay rights. The bill is part of an effort to promote traditional Russian values as opposed to Western liberalism, which the Kremlin and church see as corrupting Russian youth and contributing to a wave of protest against President Vladimir Putin's rule. Other laws that the Kremlin says are intended to protect young Russians have been adopted in recent months, including some that allow banning and blocking web content and print publications that are deemed ‘extremist’ or unfit for young audiences. The company also recognizes gay pride season each year by customizing search boxes to turn rainbow-colored when terms like 'gay' and 'gay pride' are entered. A U.S. Olympic sponsor and U.N. panel condemned Russia's law which has been criticized . as a stifling of gay rights. The law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in July bans pro-gay 'propaganda' that could be accessible to minors. Critics say it is so . restrictive that it forbids almost any public expression of support for . gay rights. Last month, for example, a newspaper editor in Russia's Far . East was fined 50,000 rubles ($1,400) for publishing an interview with a . gay school teacher who defended homosexuality.

"Take Back The Metro aims to end sexual harassment on the French underground . Dressed in pink sparkly wigs and making a lot of noise, the attention-grabbing group of women boarding the Metro could almost have been mistaken for a boisterous hen party. However these ladies had a much more serious agenda when they took to the public transport system in France's capital. Dozens of members of the feminist group Osez le Féminisme stormed the capital's subway system in a 'Take Back The Metro' demonstration against violence against women and sexual aggression on the public transport. Their aim is to raise awareness of the increasing levels of intimidation against women on the Metro and to ask the RATP, the French public transportation operator, to act to reduce it. Speaking to RFI a spokesperson for Ozez le Féminisme (which translates as Dare Feminism) explained: 'When you are a woman on the subway in Paris, you are often the victim of different types of sexual aggression. 'We have done a study in the Metro this summer in Paris, and the study showed that three out of four women were adapting their behaviour or their clothes and their way of dressing when they were going to take the Metro.' The group pasted hundreds of posters around the Metro during the demonstration, which aim to bring attention to the issue and 'expose the insecurity women feel on public transport.' 'Spreading your legs is not necessary,' one sign reads. 'It is preferable to keep your legs together. Testicles are not made of crystal and will not explode.You can thus leave more space for your neighbours. You will no longer inflict this visual pollution on them.' Signs posted by the group Osez le Féminisme on the Metro include ones that urge 'In case of sexual harassing or sexual touches: shout, ask for help, strike' 'Spreading your legs is not necessary,' one sign reads. 'It is preferable to keep your legs together' Other signs say: 'In case of sexual harassing or sexual touches: shout, ask for help, strike,' and 'When the train is crowded, do not take advantage of it to rub yourself against your neighbour.' Unsurprisingly the posters have prompted a strong response on social media, with thousands tweeting with the hash tag #TakeBackTheMetro and sharing images of the signs dotted all over public transport. '#TakeBackTheMetro encourages women to reclaim public transport' one user Tweets . 'I have never regretted leaving Paris but that was before #TakeBackTheMetro which I would love to be a park of,' one user Tweets. 'A campaign that could be replicated everywhere, RE: sexual harassment on public transport. #TakeBackTheMetro,' another posts. Take back the Metro is based on the hugely successful US organisation Take Back The Night, which fights against violence in all forms. The organisation, which has spread across Europe since it's origin in the 1970s, organises marches and sit-ins aimed at ending sexual and domestic violence.","Take Back The Metro campaign launched by group 'Osez le Féminisme'

The subtype, known as 02_AG/A, is spreading rapidly and is now thought to account for more than 50 per cent of new HIV infections in Siberia. The virus was first seen in the city of Novosibirsk in 2006 and is thought to be the most virulent subtype of the virus in Russia. Russian scientists believe they have identified a new and more virulent strain of HIV. The subtype, known as 02_AG/A, is spreading rapidly. Image shows mature HIV virus infection . It was discovered by scientists at the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Siberia, The Moscow News reports. Natalya Gashnikova, head of the retroviruses department at Vektor, said 02_AG/A could spread through the population much more quickly than the current main HIV strain found in Russia. The number of HIV positive people in Novosibirsk has jumped from 2,000 in 2007 to 15,000 in 2012, according to Russia’s Federal AIDS Centre and 50 per cent of the new cases have been caused by 02_AG/A. The newly identified subtype is not confined to Siberia – cases have also been reported in Chechnya, in the south of Russia, and Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. HIV can be divided into two main types - HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the more virulent of the two and is, therefore, responsible for the majority of cases. HIV-1 can also be divided into subgroups and the newly discovered 02_AG/A is a subgroup of HIV-1. All of the subgroups are transmitted from person to person through the same transmission methods - including unprotected sex and sharing needles - but some are easier to pass on than others. 02_AG/A is thought to be easier to transmit than some other subtypes. The virus was first seen in the city of Novosibirsk in 2006 and is thought to be the most virulent subtype of the virus in Russia. It is now thought to account for more than 50 per cent of new HIV infections in Siberia . UN figures show that the only regions . where the number of HIV infections is increasing are Eastern Europe and . Central Asia – 52 per cent of people with HIV in this area live in . Russia. This is . believed to be partly because there is little awareness of HIV in many . parts of Russia and because Russian school offer very little sex . education. The number . of new HIV infections globally has plummeted by a third since 2001 and . more than halved among children, the United Nations recently revealed. Globally, . 2.3 million people contracted the AIDS virus last year - down 33 per . cent from 2001, while 260,000 children became infected - 52 per cent . less than in 2001. ‘The annual number of new HIV infections continues to decline with especially sharp reductions in the number of children newly infected with HIV,’ UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe said. Last year, 1.6 million people died of AIDS-related deaths, down from 1.8 million in 2011 and 2.3 million in 2005. The report showed that 9.7 million people in low and middle-income countries, the bulk of those infected, had access to HIV drugs last year, compared to only 1.3 million seven years earlier. While the hike is impressive, it falls short of a UN target announced two years ago to reach 15 million people by 2015. Some 35.3 million people were living with the virus last year - about 70 per cent of them in sub-Saharan Africa - up from 30 million in 2001.","The HIV subtype 02_AG/A is spreading rapidly and is now thought to account for more than 50 per cent of new HIV infections in Siberia .

"The capture of the most wanted sub-atomic particle in physics was today named as Science journal's Breakthrough of the Year. Scientists had been chasing the Higgs boson, nicknamed the 'God particle' for more than four decades. In July the team from the European nuclear research facility at Cern in Geneva announced the detection of a particle that fitted the description of the elusive Higgs. Top breakthrough: A representation of traces of traces of a proton-proton collision measured in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experience in the search for the Higgs boson . The boson is believed to give matter mass via an associated 'Higgs field' that permeates space. Without the property of mass, the universe we live in could not exist. Scientists used the world's biggest atom smashing machine, the £2.6billion Large Hadron Collider on the Swiss-French border, to track down the missing particle. Finding the Higgs topped the list of most important discoveries of 2012 released today by Science, one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals. The particle was first proposed by a British physicist Professor Peter Higgs almost 50 years ago when he was a 34-year-old scientist working at the University of Edinburgh. Emotional moment: Professor Peter Higgs appears to wipe away a tear after scientists at the Large Hadron Collider claim to have possibly discovered a particle believed to be the Higgs boson . But until this year, no-one had been able to prove that his theory was right. Science news journalist Adrian Cho, who wrote about the discovery in the journal's latest issue, said: 'Mass must somehow emerge from interactions of the otherwise mass-less particles themselves. that's where the Higgs comes in. 'Just as an electric field consists of particles called photons, the Higgs field consists of Higgs bosons woven into the vacuum. Physicists have now blasted them out of the vacuum and into brief existence.' Science also lists nine other pioneering achievements from 2012. Curiosity coming into land on Mars: The rover's landing system was another scientific achievement hailed by the journal in its end-of-year round up .

The Denisovan Genome: Scientists sequenced the DNA blueprint of the Denisovans, an extinct species of human that lived alongside Neanderthals and the ancestors of people living today.
Making Eggs From Stem Cells: Japanese researchers showed that embryonic stem cells from mice could be coaxed into becoming viable egg cells.
Curiosity's Landing System: Mission engineers at the American space agency Nasa safely and precisely placed the Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars. They used a 'sky crane' that dropped the 3.3 ton rover to the surface from a hovering platform on three cables.
X-ray Laser Provides Protein Structure: Researchers used an X-ray laser, which shines a billion times brighter than traditional synchrotron sources, to determine the structure of an enzyme required by the parasite that causes African sleeping sickness. The advance demonstrated the potential of X-ray lasers to decipher proteins that conventional X-ray sources cannot.
Precision Engineering of Genomes: The revision and deletion of DNA in higher organisms has generally been hit-or-miss. In 2012, a tool known as TALENs, which stands for 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases,' allowed scientists to alter or inactivate specific genes in animals such as zebra fish and toads, and cells from patients with disease.
Majorana Fermions: The existence of Majorana fermions, particles that act as their own antimatter and annihilate themselves, has been debated for more than seven decades. This year, a team of physicists and chemists in the Netherlands provided the first solid evidence that such exotic matter exists, in the form of quasi-particles. These are groups of interacting electrons that behave like single particles.
The ENCODE Project: A decade-long study reported this year in more than 30 papers revealed that the human genetic code is more functional than researchers had believed. Although just 2% of the genome codes for actual proteins, the Encyclopaedia of DNA Elements, or ENCODE, project indicated that about 80% of it is active in ways such as helping to switch genes on or off.
Brain-Machine Interfaces: Scientists showed that paralysed human patients could move a mechanical arm with their minds and perform complex movements in three dimensions. The technology is still experimental, and costly, but the team is hopeful that one day it will help patients paralysed by strokes, spinal injuries and other conditions.
Neutrino Mixing Angle: Hundreds of researchers working on the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment in China found the last part of the jigsaw describing how particles known as neutrinos morph from one strain or 'flavour' to another as they travel at near-light speed. Neutrinos may someday help researchers to explain why the universe contains so much matter and so little antimatter."
"Former Arsenal star Robert Pires was allegedly punched during an Indian Super League game on Thursday. FC Goa are set to to file an official report with the league's governing body regarding allegations that their marquee player was attacked in the tunnel at half-time by Atletico de Kolkata coach Antonio Lopez Habas as the teams came off the pitch. Pires, who was part of Arsenal's 'Invincibles' squad which went unbeaten throughout the 2003-04 Premier League season en route to winning the title, was heavily involved in Goa's 2-1 home defeat.

The 40-year-old former Arsenal legend is the current club captain of the Indian Super League side . Atletico co-owner Utsav Parekh meanwhile insisted his side would send their own report to the ISL regarding the allegations. The game, played in the Goan capital Margao, featured seven yellow cards, while Atletico goalkeeping coach Deshi Bakhtaver was also sent to the stands. Goa coach Zico, a World Cup winner with Brazil, told the Indian media at a post-match press conference: 'One of our players said that he was beaten by the coach of the other team. 'Pires said he was punched in the face by the Atletico coach and it is very shameful. 'I am telling you what my players told me and I didn't see that myself but I don't think that Pires would lie and say something that didn't happen. 'And when the team entered the field in the second half, they were very nervous and during the half-time we were only trying to control their nerves and calm them down.' FC Goa released a statement on Friday evening confirming they had reported the various incidents from the match and called for strong action from Indian football's governing body.

'Mr D'Sousa has also complained to the match commissioner regarding the assault by the head coach of Atletico de Kolkata, on FC Goa's marquee player Robert Pires in the area in front of the players dressing rooms during the half-time interval. 'The team manager of team FC Goa has requested that the disciplinary committee take strong disciplinary action against the players and officials of Atletico de Kolkata for their violent conduct.' Responding to the allegations, Parekh told www.telegraphindia.com: 'Look, none of us were present on the spot when the alleged incident took place. So it wouldn't be proper for us to comment on who's right and who's wrong. 'We are writing to the ISL about it and we expect them to investigate the matter and come out with the truth. 'CCTV footage is available and so it will not be very difficult to establish the truth. Whatever the incident, one can find that out from the CCTV footage. So we will not be commenting on what Zico has said, we will wait for the ISL to investigate the matter first.'

Atletico de Kolkata, who are co-owned by La Liga side Atletico Madrid, are the current leaders in the inaugural ISL season with 10 points from four games, with FC Goa in sixth place. A spokesperson for the ISL confirmed both clubs had been in touch over the allegations with the matter now being escalated to the disciplinary committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF). Kolkata and Goa are traditional powerhouses of Indian club football, with their rivalry evident from the start of the game, which also saw former Arsenal man Andre Santos score for FC Goa in the first half. Players had been involved in heated exchanges leading up to the half-time whistle, though it is not yet clear what sparked the alleged incident involving Pires and Habas. ISL spokesperson Leeladhar Singh said: 'Both clubs have submitted written letters. The disciplinary committee at the AIFF is reviewing the incident. 'They will pronounce the verdict as and when the conclusion is made from the evidence. The AIFF disciplinary committee will look at the evidence as well as the letters (submitted by both clubs). 'It would be too early to predict what the outcome will be. The AIFF will look at all the evidence. They are looking into all the aspects.'

"The military judge presiding over the case of the Fort Hood shooter has blocked several key pieces of evidence that prosecutors said would explain the mindset of the soldier accused in the 2009 rampage. On Monday it was revealed that the judge has banned prosecutors from giving any speculation into Major Nidal Hasan’s motive in the shooting that left 13 dead and 30 others wounded, including the belief that he felt he had a ‘jihad duty’ to carry out the attack. Prosecutors had asked the judge to approve several witnesses and various evidence to support what they allege motivated Hasan but the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, blocked nearly all of it. Motive unknown: The judge has blocked several pieces of evidence that could give insight into accused killer Major Nidal Hasan's mindset at the time of the 2009 shooting on Fort Hood Army base in Texas . Osborn barred any reference Hasan Akbar, a Muslim soldier sentenced to death for attacking fellow soldiers in Kuwait during the 2003 Iraq invasion. Prosecutors wanted to prove Hasan's attack was a 'copycat,' but the judge said introducing such material would 'only open the door to a mini-trial' of Akbar. Snapped? Hasan was an Army psychiatrist until 2009, when he admits to killing 13 and injuring 30. He was found guilty today on all counts of against him . She also said such evidence would result in a 'confusion of issues, unfair prejudice, waste of time and undo delay.' The judge said prosecutors also couldn't introduce three emails, ruling that the needed redactions would make them irrelevant. The contents of the emails were never disclosed, but the FBI has said Hasan sent numerous emails starting in December 2008 to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical U.S.-born Islamic cleric killed by a drone strike in Yemen in 2011. The judge also told prosecutors that they couldn't cite Hasan's interest years ago in conscientious objector status and his past academic presentations. Osborn said such evidence was too old and irrelevant. However, the judge will allow evidence about Internet searches on Hasan's computer around the time of the attack and websites that Hasan had listed as 'favorites.' Osborn said that information was more timely. Military prosecutors opened the trial by saying they would show that Hasan felt he had a 'jihad duty,' referring to a Muslim term for a religious war or struggle. After calling almost 80 witnesses during the last two weeks, prosecutors said Friday that they would begin tackling the question this week. Prosecutors indicated that they had between 15 and 25 witnesses left, though it wasn't immediately clear how Monday's ruling would shorten prosecutors' case. Making his case: Hasan, seen with a beard in court on August 8, is serving as his own lawyer in the case but has two standby defense attorneys on hand . On guard: Security has been on high alert throughout the trial, which is being held on the grounds of Fort Hood . Either way, Hasan was expected to get his chance to defend himself as early as Tuesday. But the Army psychiatrist - who is acting as his own attorney - has put up little in a way of a defense so far and remained largely silent during the first two weeks of his trial. He signaled before trial that he had just two witnesses and during a barely one-minute opening statement, he told jurors that evidence 'will clearly show that I am the shooter,' but he said it wouldn't tell the whole story. Hasan faces numerous charges of murder and attempted premeditated murder. If convicted, he could face the death penalty.","Judge blocked emails that shooter Nidal Hasan reportedly sent to radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki .

"After months of meticulous planning, Susan and Carl Smith thought they had arranged the perfect wedding day. But they hadn’t considered that a rock star might turn things up a notch by making a guest appearance. The bride and groom were left speechless when their luxurious wedding reception was interrupted by The Who frontman Roger Daltrey. Wedding crasher: Susan and Carl Smith look on in amazement as The Who frontman Roger Daltrey drops in to sing at reception . The rock star became a welcome wedding crasher as he took to the stage and sang to the disbelieving couple as they stood in shock beside him. Daltrey, 70, was staying at the five-star hotel where the reception was taking place ahead of a concert in front of 13,000 people. But when the performer heard that the couple were ardent fans of his legendary rock group he decided to drop in for a more intimate performance. The singer took to the stage to deliver a short speech in which he congratulated the couple in front of around 100 guests. But when the excited crowd started urging him to sing, Daltrey did not think twice as he joined the awestruck wedding band in a rendition of one of his hit singles to wild cheers. The couple said they were still in ‘disbelief’ yesterday at the rock and roll conclusion to their special day. Mrs Smith, a marketing manager, even joked that her careful planning was now redundant as their guests will only remember the day for their brush with one of the country’s best-known rock stars. For the album: Daltrey, 70, who was staying at the same hotel, poses with bride Susan Smith . She said: ‘It was unexpected but it just made it the perfect day. It was unbelievable and better than we ever could have imagined.’ The 27-year-old spotted Daltry at Marr Hall, the luxury golf and spa hotel outside Glasgow where the wedding reception was taking place, before the reception on Saturday got underway. When she approached the singer and he agreed to have a photograph taken with her, the bride said she was already ecstatic. ‘I was just pleased that he was happy enough to have a photograph taken with me a few hours before and I thought that was the end of it,’ she said. ‘When he went away for his dinner I actually said to the guests not to bother him as he was just trying to have a quiet night.’ But having been approached by a persuasive friend of the couple’s Daltrey entered the reception room, with the band stopping mid-song as they noticed one of their heroes was in the room. His decision to play with the wedding band almost went pear-shaped however as the nervous act had never practised a song by The Who before. When one of the group said that he used to play Can’t Explain - The Who’s first single and a top ten hit in 1965 - they decided to improvise and received rave reviews from the crowd. The visibly delighted Daltrey gesticulated to the crowd throughout the performance and serenaded the bride and groom who were standing at the side of the stage. Daltrey also paid tribute to the Armed Forces after learning that Mr Smith served in the Parachute Regiment for eight years and that many of his former colleagues were in attendance. A speechless Mr Smith, 26, who now works in private security in Iraq, described the performance as ‘legendary’. Mrs Smith said: ‘We’re fans of The Who so it was all just really excited. I think one of the main reasons he came in is that he wanted to thank all of those guys for their service. ‘But when he was on stage everybody started chanting for him to sing a song and he quickly decided that he would.’ ‘I think all of our guests are going away thinking they have never been to as good a wedding and never will again. It made the day for everyone.’ ‘Afterwards we had a little chat and he was congratulating us and wished us health and happiness for the future. He was really sweet.’ I'm with the band: The  musicians meet the star and pose  after improvising The Who's hit single Can't Explain . Mrs Smith joked: ‘I almost feel a bit annoyed as there were so many things that I planned but this was obviously the best bit and you just could not have planned it.’ She revealed that it was Mr Smith’s boss, described as the ‘life and soul of the party’, who ‘sweet talked’ the singer into getting involved in the celebrations. ‘We still don’t quite know how he did it or what he said but I’m sure he’ll be telling his story for years.’ Tommy Bell, singer and guitarist with wedding band Milestone, said: ‘When he came through to the room we knew we needed to play something. ‘We were just in shock. Our guitarist Graham knew a bit of Can’t Explain so we just made it up as we went along.’ Mr Bell, 33, describing the ‘magical’ gig as his best ever performance, said: ‘The song pretty well too. He kept turning to the guitarist and saying ‘do a solo’ but poor Graham hardly knew the chords. ‘Our previous brushes with celebrities involved the banjo player from Mumford and Sons and PC Plum from Balamory, so I think this has gone straight to the top.’ Taking to the stage: Daltrey gave a speech to the 100 guests before launching into his performance . The Smiths, from Glasgow, met while holidaying in Ibiza over four years ago and got engaged last December during a weekend retreat to the Highlands. They flew to Thailand for a two-week honeymoon last night as Daltrey took to the stage at Glasgow’s SSE Hydro arena, joining The Who’s lead songwriter and guitarist Pete Townsend. Daltry, who collected a CBE in 2005, is considered one of the greatest living British rock singers after numerous hit albums with his band and as a solo artist over a 50-year career.","Daltrey, 70, was staying at Marr Hall hotel near Glasgow before his concert .

A big-shot Hollywood producer who for decades was working as an Israeli spy and arms dealer has defended his actions and said it was 'exciting' being his country's 'James Bond.' Arnon Milchan, 68, who's famous for smash hit movies including 'Fight Club' and 'Pretty Woman,' spoke openly for the first time about his espionage work in an Israeli TV special that aired Monday night. The program reveals Milchan, at the special request of his friend Shimon Peres, who is now the country's president' set up and operated some 30 companies in 17 countries that helped Israel obtain parts and plans for its nuclear project in the 1980s. He brokered deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the show. 'I did it for my country and I'm proud of it,' Milchan said of his work for Israel's now-defunct spy unit Bureau of Scientific Relations. 'Do you know what it was like to be a 20-something guy whose country decided to let him be James Bond? Wow! The action! That was exciting.' The film tycoon spoke to Israeli investigative journalist Ilana Dayan for the season premiere of her current affairs show, Uvda.

When the FBI discovered one of his . companies was used to ship nuclear triggers to Israel without proper . licenses in 1985, an executive who was involved was indicted.

"No sooner is one problem solved than another crops up. Alastair Cook is discovering, like his predecessors, that the idioms of the England Test captaincy translate awkwardly into the one-day. Not for the first time this summer, this column fears English cricket is in denial. The Test team corrected things just in time: Cook resolved to get further forward to India’s seamers, Ian Bell woke up, an unfit Matt Prior was dropped, and the senior bowlers got their heads round the idea of an English length. It helped that India were a rabble. But now that England are faced with eight months of 50-over cricket – and, at the risk of cheering everyone up, the prospect of a sixth successive World Cup failure – the merciless truth for Cook is that he now faces another set of searching questions. Limited appeal: Alastair Cook (right) and England are really struggling in the ODI series against India . One-day cricket has always left English cricket navel-gazing and head-scratching. Just ask Mike Atherton, Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss. It is one of the most tiresome rituals in the modern game. And it is deeply ingrained. English cricket prizes the stubbornness that helped Cook turn around the Test team. Grit, phlegm and the knowledge that, across a series lasting 25 days, substance will eventually trump style – these are what matter to the English cricket psyche. And they are perfectly attuned to the Test match. One-day cricket has always been an afterthought, partly because the English just aren’t on its more flamboyant wavelength. It was ever thus. The mistake that England have been making for more than two decades is to imagine that the man chosen to get the best out of the Test team – the man who most unflinchingly embodies the grind-’em-down school of leadership – can also do the trick in the 50-over game. It was unfair on Atherton, Hussain, Vaughan and Strauss. It is unfair on Cook. Curiously, England’s most enlightened one-day moment came with the appointment of Adam Hollioake in the late 1990s, a move which briefly allowed Atherton to concentrate on the Test job. England’s most recent multi-team tournament triumph came in Sharjah, way back in December 1997, under Hollioake. And while the probity of that success has always been the subject of whispers, Hollioake’s charisma and capacity to free up his players are still spoken of with awe by those involved. The experiment did not last long. Soon after, England lost one-day series in the Caribbean and at home to South Africa, and Hollioake was back in the ranks. The split-captaincy was considered too radical, Hollioake probably too un-English. Yet it was his very un-Englishness that made him such a vibrant, instinctive leader. England’s defeats last week at Cardiff and Trent Bridge were depressingly familiar. All MS Dhoni had to do was bowl his spinners – any spinner would do, even occasional wicketkeeper Ambati Rayudu – and he was again being hailed as a puppet-master extraordinaire. (Truly, it is amazing how short memories can be in sport: a fortnight ago, Dhoni’s Test humiliation was supposed to have robbed him of his final shreds of dignity.) Yet to listen to Cook’s explanation for why his team managed only one boundary between the 18th and 44th overs in Nottingham was to play an old and broken record. It amounted to this: wickets had been falling too regularly to allow the risky big shots. He spoke as if the tumble of wickets was an inconvenience, visited upon his team by forces unknown. Despite evidence that has been in the public domain ever since New Zealand opened with Mark Greatbatch at the 1992 World Cup – and was reinforced by Sanath Jayasuriya four years later – England cling tenaciously to the belief that wickets in hand matter above all else. Dark clouds gathering: England have limited time to prepare for the World Cup Down Under in February . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . The belated inclusion of Alex Hales suggested that, in their heart of hearts, the selectors recognise this for the ante-diluvian thinking it undoubtedly is. But even with Hales in the current set-up, only he, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler have the capacity to destroy an attack. There are too many eggs in too few baskets. Other teams’ top six or seven contain no more than one anchorman; England’s has at least two too many. And so totals of 230 become the norm. Once in a while, England will post 280-plus – yet even that may not be enough. Perhaps any attempts at a rationalisation are futile. The dressing-room can protest all it likes: one-day cricket simply means less to this country than Tests. When that is the case, minds are not turned to the task in hand with quite the same rigour or vigour. Lost again: Cook and England trudge off after defeat by India at Trent Bridge . India suffer the same problem, but in reverse. They seem resigned to their fate in Test matches if the ball isn’t turning, yet fully expect their naturally gifted stroke-makers to chase down any one-day target. These expectations become self-fulfilling. The decision to stick with Cook as one-day captain is yet another example of a combination that has bedevilled our game ever since England reached the World Cup final in 1992: conservatism on the one hand, blind faith in the man whose main job is to lead the Test team on the other. Stubbornness can work well in five-day cricket. In the one-day version it may be less useful. THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . A familiar tune . Graeme Swann thinks England don’t have ‘cat in hell’s chance’ of winning the World Cup. He’s probably right – and deserves kudos for commenting so frankly on players who until recently counted among his team-mates. But it never ceases to amaze how quickly ex-players make the transition from the field of play to the commentary box. Often, these same players were among the fiercest critics of the press. Now, these gamekeepers turn poachers as if it’s the most natural thing in the world. This is all well and good, but can someone please explain to them while they’re still players that the occasional piece of media criticism does not mean the media are heartless and evil. It’s called doing our job. And Swann is doing his nicely. Gamekeeper turned poacher: Graeme Swann (right) has been critical of Cook and England . Damned if he does... Alastair Cook was unimpressed by Swann’s comments, leaving some to wonder about the wisdom of the press-conference retaliation. This followed Cook’s testy response back in June to Shane Warne’s relentless commentary-box advice. But we can’t have it both ways: a captain can’t be damned for toeing some tedious, platitude-filled party line, then damned for giving an honest answer to a straight question. The wheel of life . The tendency of most teams’ fans is to imagine that theirs is the most miserable lot in the world. Think of India a fortnight ago and England last week. And now throw Australia into the mix after a three-wicket one-day loss to Zimbabwe moved them from first in the world rankings to fourth. Surprise victory: Zimbabwe stars Prosper Utseya (front left) and Tendai Chatara (front right) celebrate . ‘There’s probably not enough expletives in the English language at the moment for the way I'm feeling,’ their coach Darren Lehmann said after Zimbabwe had beaten them for the first time since the Duncan Fletcher-inspired heist at the 1983 World Cup. ‘It’s just embarrassing for everyone involved in the touring party, and I hope they’re hurting. They should be.’ They’ll forget it soon enough, and will probably win the World Cup next year. But no result feels more real than the one that’s just happened.","England play eight months of 50-over cricket to prepare for World Cup .

"The soldier on trial for the deadly 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood refused to put up a fight on Wednesday, resting his case without calling a single witness or testifying in his own defense. Major Nidal Hasan could face the death penalty if convicted for the attack that killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others at the Texas military base. But when given the chance to rebut prosecutors' lengthy case - which included nearly 90 witnesses - the Army psychiatrist declined. About five minutes after court began Wednesday, a day after prosecutors rested their case, the judge asked Hasan how he wanted to proceed. He answered: ‘The defense rests.’ 'The defense rests': Accused Fort Hood shooter Major Nadal Hasan was slated to begin his defense Wednesday but called no witnesses . Brief: Court was adjourned after five minutes without Hasan even defending himself . Snapped? Hasan was an Army psychiatrist until 2009, when he admits to killing 13 and injuring 30. He was found guilty today on all counts of against him . The judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, then . asked Hasan: ‘You have the absolute right to remain silent. You do not . have to say anything. You have the right to testify if you choose. Understand?’ Hasan answered that he did. When the judge asked if this was his personal decision, he said: ‘It is.’ Osborn . then adjourned the trial until Thursday morning, agreeing to give . prosecutors an extra day to prepare their closing arguments. Jurors were . led out of the courtroom. Hasan's . move wasn't completely unexpected. He has made no attempt since he . trial began two weeks ago to prove his innocence. He also has done . little to challenge the narrative of military prosecutors, who showed . evidence of Hasan's laptop being used to search the Internet for ‘jihad’ and find articles about calls to attack Americans in the days and even . hours before the Nov. 5, 2009, shooting. He has sat mostly silent, raising few objections, declining to let military lawyers take over his defense and questioning only three of prosecutors' witnesses. Several of those witnesses were shot during the attack and recalled hearing a shout of ‘Allahu Akbar!’ - Arabic for ‘God is great!’ - inside a crowded medical building before Hasan opened fire using a laser-sighted handgun. Hasan, an American-born Muslim, suggested before trial that he wanted to argue that the killings were in defense of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, but that strategy was rejected by the judge. Since then, he has offered little for jurors to consider. In fact, during a brief opening statement, Hasan said evidence would show he was the shooter and called himself a soldier who had ‘switched sides’ in a war. No go: Judge Colonel Tara Osborn refused to allow Hasan to argue he was defending the Taliban when he killed 13 people and injured 30 others. Hasan has said little since the ruling . Paralyzed: A wheelchair is pushed through a secured gate to the courthouse before Major Nidal Hasan arrived Wednesday. Hasan was paralyzed when fire was returned in the 2009 attack . Lopsided: U.S. Army Cololnels Steve Henricks, left, and Mike Mulligan, right, of the prosecution, arrive to court Wednesday. The prosecution called nearly 90 witnesses . Frenzy: Members of the media are escorted by U.S. Army personnel into the Lawrence H. Williams Judicial Center for proceedings Wednesday . Secured: A Fort Hood Police Mobile Command Center is stationed outside the proceedings Wednesday in which Hasan rested his case after five minutes, no witnesses, and without testifying on his own behalf . Suspicions about Hasan's defense strategy elevated as the trial dragged on, as he leaked documents to journalists revealing that he told military mental health workers after the attack that he could ‘still be a martyr’ if convicted and executed by the government. Yet he never played the role of a high-threat, angry extremist in court. Hasan, who was paralyzed from the waist down after being shot by Fort Hood police officers responding to the rampage, didn't get agitated in court or raise his voice. But that passive and muted presence convinced his court-ordered, standby attorneys that he was trying to convince jurors to convict him and sentence him to death. The attorneys had asked that their advisory roles be minimized, saying Hasan's defense strategy was ‘repugnant,’ but the judge refused. Scrutiny: Media scrutiny has been intense in the case which has drawn the attention of much of the world since the 2009 incident in which Hasan admits to killing 13 . Making his case: Hasan, seen with a beard in court on August 8, is serving as his own lawyer in the case but has two standby defense attorneys on hand . Hasan began the trial signaling that he would call on just two people to testify - one a mitigation expert in capital murder cases and the other a California professor of psychology and religion. But on Tuesday, he indicated to the judge that he would now call neither witness. That left even Osborn raising her own skepticism that Hasan would seize his last chance to defend himself. Prosecutors were expected to give their closing argument on Thursday, though it was unclear whether Hasan would do the same.","Major Nidal Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 30 when he opened fire at the Texas military base and could face the death penalty .
The Army psychiatrist said at trial that he is the shooter and that he 'switched sides' as a soldier in the war on terror ."
"A new film lifts the lid on history’s most extraordinary sisters; conjoined British twins Daisy and Violet Hilton. Under the scheming control of a promoter, they were exploited as freaks and became one of the hottest attractions in a travelling circus in the early 1900s.

Double trouble: A new film lifts the lid on history¿s most extraordinary sisters; conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton. Pictured here, the sisters take the American citizenship oath in the early 1900s . Must-see: A poster for the documentary, Bound by Flesh, directed by Leslie Zemeckis who spent years researching the Hilton sisters Daisy and Violet . Daisy and Violet were born to . 21-year-old maid Kate Skinner in Brighton, 1908, as the result of Kate’s . affair with one of her bosses son. The . twins were joined back-to-back at their lower spine, and Skinner was . convinced this deformity was God’s punishment for her dalliance. She . sold them off to a midwife named Mary Hilton, who adopted the girls and . promptly displayed them in a local pub touting the twin’s deformity to . make money. Reports have . said that Mary abused them both physically and mentally. After her . death in 1915, Mary's daughter Edith Hilton and her husband Meyer . Meyers, a sideshow producer, were waiting to take their own control of . the girls. Daisy and Violet photo in 1956 opening the Hilton Snack Shop in Florida, right, and a Hollywood pose, left . They took them to America, where the sisters eventually gained citizenship, and paraded them around the country, heralding them as vaudeville, sideshow performers and freaks. It wasn’t long before the sister act – the UK's first pair of conjoined twins to survive infancy – became world famous. They performed around the globe with the likes of Bob Hope and appeared in the films Freaks (1932) and Chained for Life (1950). But . in 1931, older, wiser and still not receiving a penny of their amassed . fortune from Myers, they sued their managers for their freedom in a . widely-publicized trial. As . reported in Charlotte Magazine – the local magazine for the U.S. town, . Charlotte, North Carolina where the sisters spent the last days of their . lives - they talked about their experience in an autobiography, The . Lives and Loves of the Hilton Sisters, published in 1942. Sister act: Daisy and Violet were the UK's first pair of conjoined twins to survive infancy and became world famous .

After taking their career into their own hands, the sisters attracted a string of admirers. To . avoid one of them playing the gooseberry they had a telephone booth . installed in their plush New York apartment, specially modified so that . one twin could sit inside whispering sweet nothings to her lover on the . phone, while the other sat outside reading a magazine or filing her . nails. Life on film: Director Leslie Zemeckis, pictured here, has made a documentary about the Hilton sister's life, entitled Bound by Flesh . One admirer, world . famous magician Harry Houdini, taught the sisters how to mentally . separate themselves from each other if one was to be engaging in sexual . activity. Mental Liberty, as . they called it, gave them remarkable tolerance of each other’s romantic . interludes. ‘Why, I just turn over and read a book and eat an apple,’ said Violet. In 1934, Violet . became engaged to a handsome bandleader named Maurice Lambert, but . after their application for a marriage licence had been turned down in . 21 states - all arguing it would be immoral to sanction the union of one . man and two women - Lambert lost heart and ended the relationship. To . restore their superstar status,  publicity agent Terry Turner . suggested one of the twins should get married at the newly-opened . 70,000-seat Cotton Bowl sports stadium in Dallas. The groom was to be a . lifelong friend of the sisters, a dancer named Jim Moore. Violet agreed . to be Moore’s bride even though they knew he was homosexual (the . marriage was never consummated). Violet . later made the mistake of admitting it was a sham and filed for . divorce. She claimed she had been coerced into the marriage by Turner, . but loyal fans were furious to discover they had been conned. The Hilton . twins had suddenly lost their endearing innocence and their careers . never recovered. Daisy died . from a severe bout of flu in 1968, by which point the sisters were . working in a local supermarket in Charlotte. Because the twins were . attached only by skin and not organs, Violet was not in danger. But just . a few days later, Violet died, too and both bodies were found in their . hallway by their boss. Their final wish? That they should remain joined in death, in one, unusually wide coffin.

"Gesticulating wildly on the witness stand Thursday, a grimacing and sobbing Ana Trujillo told the jurors that she stabbed her boyfriend with a stiletto heel to save her own life. Trujillo, 45, took the witness stand in Houston, Texas for the first time during the two-week trial as part of the punishment phase, which will determine her sentence. She faces the possibility of life in prison. The jury convicted Trujillo Tuesday of murder in last June's killing of 59-year-old Alf Stefan Andersson at his home. Prosecutors say she pinned him down and stabbed him at least 25 times with the five-and-a-half inch heel of her shoe. Scroll down for video . In her own words: Ana Trujillo testifies during the punishment phase of her trial on Thursday, two days after she was convicted of killing her boyfriend with a shoe . Emotional: Trujillo told the jurors she killed him in a desperate attempt to save her own life during a brutal fight of more than an hour . Narrative: The 45-year-old convicted killer said she was chased down, knocked into a wall and thrown over a couch by the victim . Victimized: During more than five hours of testimony, Trujillo said that she had been repeatedly abused by men . Blood on her hands: Trujillo testified that she did not realize how badly she injured her boyfriend until she looked at her gore-covered hands . Trujillo's attorneys say Andersson attacked her and she defended herself with the only weapon she had available, her shoe. During . more than five hours of rambling testimony by mid-afternoon, Trujillo . said that she had been repeatedly abused by men, including sexual . assault by her first husband. Trujillo told jurors Andersson became enraged and she fought for her life during a fight that lasted more than an hour. She said she tried to calm him down, but Andersson started yelling at her and Trujillo realized she could not talk him down. ‘I . became frightened. I did fear for my life. I felt he lost it,’ she . said, adding that she started striking him with the shoe anywhere she . could. ‘Why did you keep on hitting him?’ her attorney Jack Carroll asked. ‘He wouldn't let go of my leg. The pain wouldn't stop,’ she said. Reenactment: Defense attorney Jack Carroll, left, and Ana Trujillo demonstrate the fight that led to a fatal stabbing . When asked by her attorney, Jack Carroll (pictured), why she kept striking her lover with the shoe, Trujillo replied that he would not let go of her leg . Trujillo said that at first she hit him on his back and on his arms, then on his head as a last resort. ‘I had no idea I was hurting him that . badly,’ she said. ‘I reached over and said, “Oh God, what happened?” I . reached over and my hands were full of blood.’ She . also told jurors that Andersson was a heavy drinker who refused to eat . and whose mental and physical health began to deteriorate. She said she became afraid of him because at night he would wake up angry, disoriented and start yelling. When . asked by her lawyer, Mr Carroll, why she didn't leave Andersson, . Trujillo said: 'Because I loved him and I wanted him to get better. I . wanted him to stop drinking so much.' Ana Trujillo reacts after being found guilty of killing her boyfriend, after the jury deliberated less than two hours, on Tuesday in Houston, Texas . But during the testimony, Trujillo did not discuss Andersson in great detail. During often meandering testimony, . Trujillo told jurors she had a history of being sexually or physically . abused by men. She said she had been sexually assaulted by her first . husband and told jurors that another boyfriend had kicked her in the . stomach when she was pregnant, resulting in a miscarriage. Trujillo was found guilty this week of killing Alf Stefan Andersson with her stiletto shoe . Trujillo described being attacked in an incident reminiscent of Andersson's slaying. She told jurors a friend in 2009 had tried to rape her in his apartment, pinning her down and that she used the only weapon within reach - a candlestick - to fend him off. Trujillo's former friend testified on Wednesday that it was Trujillo who knocked him out with the candlestick in an unprovoked attack. No charges were filed related to that incident. She also discussed her upbringing, including growing up in Arizona after being born in Mexico, and her various jobs, including massage therapist, club bouncer and artist. At times during her verbose testimony, prosecutor John Jordan would ask the judge to instruct Trujillo to not answer her lawyer's questions in the form of narration. Trujillo's attorney has not yet questioned her in detail about the night Andersson died. On Wednesday, prosecutors presented 19 witnesses during the trial's punishment phase. Most of the witnesses detailed Trujillo's criminal history or firsthand experiences in which she became violent toward them when she drank. Trujillo was arrested twice for drunken driving, once in 2008 and again in 2010. A psychologist testifying for the defense told jurors Trujillo had been in a series of violent or abusive relationships, including with Andersson, and she was acting in self-defense on the night of the slaying. Jurors on Wednesday also heard from Anderson's family and friends, who testified that he was a good person who wouldn't hesitate to help anyone and that they were still trying to understand his violent death.

"A friend of Claudia Winkleman's daughter has told how the eight-year-old's witch costume caught fire during an evening of trick-or-treat. Matilda Thykier is being treated for severe burns with her mother, the presenter of TV's Strictly Come Dancing, by her side after an accident on Friday. One of the schoolgirl's young friends has now told of the moment a candle on a doorstep of a house they were visiting set light to the cape of her witch's outfit. Scroll down for video . Injured: Claudia Winkleman's daughter Matilda, right, has been hurt after her Halloween costume caught fire in an accident on Halloween night . Family: Kris Thykier with his daughter Matilda in April 2013 (left) and just over a fortnight ago on October 18 . Zoya Bacolv, seven, was out trick-or-treating with her two sisters Isla, five, and Laila, eight, and a group of adults when the accident happened. Zoya said of Matilda: 'She was outside a  house when her cape caught fire, I think she was dressed as a witch. I think it was a candle outside a house that set her cape on fire. 'I saw her when the ambulance came, they had to wrap her up to put out the fire. 'She burnt her leg. They put her in a cast thing and put lots of plasters on her leg. She's going to be hospital for a week. It was really scary.' Zoya's mother Evelyn Bacolv, 34, said: 'I only know from what I have heard from my daughters, but I have heard Matilda has been seriously injured. 'I'm not sure exactly where it happened because they didn't see Matilda when the cape caught fire, only when the ambulance arrived. They were in group of people and Matilda was out with another group. It is worrying.' Mrs Bacolv said she would be considering whether or not to allow her daughters to dress up with capes in the future after this incident. Matilda was treated at the scene in west London after her Halloween costume is believed to have been set alight by a candle . Popular TV personality Miss Winkleman has spent the past four days at her little girl's bedside. Miss Winkleman, who missed the Strictly shows on Saturday and Sunday nights, and her husband Kris Thykier, both 42, have said they are 'hopeful' she will make 'a full recovery'. They warned parents about the dangers of candles, open fires and fireworks. In a statement, the couple said: 'Our daughter was involved in an accident on Friday night while celebrating Halloween. She is having the best care possible and we are hopeful of a full recovery. 'We would like to thank everyone who has been so supportive and particularly the NHS doctors, nurses and staff who have been absolutely incredible. 'We would like to take this opportunity to remind anyone taking part in fireworks parties or Guy Fawkes celebrations to be vigilant about the dangers of candles, open fires and fireworks and to please have the appropriate safety measures in place and to hand.' According to a neighbour, who did not wish to be named, the party had just embarked on the trip, when the accident occurred. Miss Winkleman is believed to have been nearby. The neighbour said: 'Apparently there were candles outside [the house] and you know how all these costumes are made of highly flammable material.' She added: 'The poor girl's dress literally went up in a fireball and somebody tried to put it out. 'They pushed her to the ground and sort of rolled her over and tried to put it out but by that time she had got burnt on her fingers and her arm. His [the man who tried to help] fingers got burnt as well. 'They were literally just on their way [trick or treating], it was right at the start. It's awful, awful.' The eight-year-old (right) played a bridesmaid in the 2013 film I Give It a Year with Minnie Driver (left) Absence: Miss Winkleman (pictured with Tess Daly) is at her daughter's bedside and it is unclear when she will return to the BBC show . The incident happened in an upmarket part of west London, not far from former Prime Minister Tony Blair's house. It is believed the family were due to attend a celebrity Halloween party hosted by Jonathan Ross later that evening. Miss Winkleman's nanny told The Sun: 'Claudia was very worried. She hasn't left her side.' Last weekend Miss Winkleman was replaced on Strictly at short notice by Zoe Ball. At the time, the BBC only said one of her children was 'unwell'. Miss Ball will step in again this Saturday to present alongside Tess Daly. Miss Winkleman and Mr Thykier, who married 14 years ago, also have two sons, Jake, 11, and Arthur, three. She recently revealed that she and co-host Miss Daly, who has two young children, spend most of their time backstage talking about schools, homework and their lack of sleep. In 2010, she told the Daily Mail she felt having babies was 'addictive' and said she would always put motherhood ahead of her career. 'My kids come first. They mean everything to me. I'll worry about them until I'm dead. They'll always be my babies,' she said. 'Jake went on a sleepover and it broke my heart. I don't understand parents who wish their kids away. I won't let my son leave the house on his own until he's 28, not a moment sooner. Zoe Ball (left) stood in for Claudia Winkleman to present Strictly Come Dancing with Tess Daly (right) 'When I'm asked to travel for work I say no. You'll never say on your deathbed, 'I wish I'd made that documentary that would have taken me away from home for four weeks'.' A spokesman for Strictly said: 'Zoe Ball will co-host Strictly Come Dancing this weekend. 'All our thoughts and very best wishes are with Claudia and her family at this time.' London Fire Brigade deputy commissioner Rita Dexter said: 'I hope Claudia's daughter has a speedy recovery after this ordeal. It's a shocking but timely reminder that open flames can be lethal if you don't keep an eye on them or they are left unattended. 'Make sure candles are placed well away from flammable items and clothing, otherwise the results can be catastrophic.' A spokesman for the London Ambulance Service said: 'We were called at 5.23pm on Friday to an address in W2. 'We sent an ambulance crew, a single responder by car and an advanced paramedic to the scene. We treated a child and took her to hospital as a priority.' Cambridge art graduate Miss Winkelman is also the host of The Great British Sewing Bee and has been a panellist on Never Mind The Buzzcocks and Have I Got News For You. An Oscars host for Sky, she has also previously worked in fashion, motoring and nutrition journalism, and has co-hosted Comic Relief does Fame Academy and the Eurovision Dance Contest. Miss Winkleman and former PR executive Mr Thykier, whose film production credits include Kick-Ass and Paul Potts movie One Chance, married in 2000. The Strictly presenter, the daughter of former newspaper editor Eve Pollard, had previously fronted the weekly results show and stepped in during Sir Bruce's occasional absences. The London Fire Brigade reiterated the star's warning about the dangers of candles, open fires and fireworks. Last year, there were 82 fire-related injuries between Halloween and Bonfire Night - a 37 per cent increase on the number of injuries recorded in 2012.","Matilda Thykier was left with severe burns in an accident on Friday night .

"Thousands of soldiers, many still serving in the deadly war zones of Afghanistan, will be laid off as the Pentagon enforces mandatory spending cuts. Fox News reports that roughly 2,600 captains and other officers will receive 'pink slip' letters with even more expected to be let go after that. The controversial move is part of a larger plan to reduce the number of U.S. soldiers from 520,000 to 450,000, said Defense Department officials. End of tour: Roughly 2,600 captains and other officers will receive 'pink slip' letters with even more expected to be let go after that . The decision to lay off soldiers in active combat has been called not only bad for morale but outright dangerous. 'It puts the soldier, the soldier's family and the men under his command at risk,' said retired Major Gen. Robert Scales, who is now a Fox News contributor. 'Young officers look at each other and wonder who is next.' The plan has been defended as 'a balanced approach that maintains readiness while trying to minimize turbulence within the officer corps,' by military officials. However the announcement also came under fire from Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, a top Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Phase one: The controversial move is part of a larger plan to reduce the number of U.S. soldiers from 520,000 to 450,000, said Defense Department officials . 'Once again [President Obama] is . putting domestic politics ahead of the security of our nation,' eh said.

'My heart goes out to these men and women who are risking their lives . and making great sacrifices, yet are now being told they are being . separated from the Army and will have no job when they return home to . their families.' A report in USA Today earlier this year when Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced the cuts noted that 'tens of thousands' of military personnel could be let go in the coming years. Blasted: Conservatives have criticized Obama for the reduction, calling it a dangers and demoralizing move for troops in combat . Similar reductions were made after the war in Vietnam, but unlike that conflict military action in Iraq and Afghanistan has been carried out by relatively small armies composed entirely of volunteers. Surveys showed that approximately one in three middle class military families are now worried about their job security, a jump from one in four in the summer of 2013. 'Everybody who's getting looked at right now ... has to really start . thinking about, 'Well, what if?'' Army Maj. Timothy Hyde, a married . and the father of two, told reporters in February upon learning his job was in danger. 'I'll be disappointed if I get . selected for early separation,' Hyde said.

"A personal trainer has been diagnosed with a brain tumour on the day his mother finished treatment for breast cancer. Scott Dixon, 24, should have been celebrating with his mother, Jackie Dixon, 56, but instead he was preparing for radiotherapy. He said: ‘She had planned a bit of a celebration that night, but then everything changed. Scott Dixon, 24, was diagnosed with a brain tumour the day that his mother, Jackie Dixon, finished treatment for breast cancer. Mr Dixon started radiotherapy as his mother was recovering from chemotherapy . ‘It was really tough.’ As a result, Ms Dixon, from South Shields, in Tyne and Wear, finished her own chemotherapy and radiotherapy and immediately started looking after her youngest son. ‘It was horrible, just so unbelievable,’ said the grandmother-of-five. ‘But I think because it was the last day of my treatment I could then just think about Scott. ‘I just totally put me out of my mind and it really meant I could really think about getting Scott through his treatment, he was so poorly.’ Mr Dixon, who also lives in South Shields, was fit and healthy when he started to notice a problem with his left eye. A trip to the opticians saw him referred to hospital before specialists at the Freeman Hospital, in Newcastle, uncovered the cause of his problems. Mr Dixon was diagnosed after going to see his optician about a problem with his left eye. The optician referred him to hospital where the tumour was discovered . In August and September 2012 he underwent radiotherapy every day for six weeks. Mr Dixon says that his son Lewis, five, and unborn daughter, Scarlett, with girlfriend Chantelle Watson, kept him going. ‘I had to have an operation on my brain in December last year because they found lesions at the front of the brain,’ he said. Mr Dixon says that his son, Lewis, five, and unborn daughter, Scarlett, kept him going through the treatment . ‘I actually found out I was having a daughter on the day of my operation, she’s four-months now. ‘My son Lewis was a little diamond throughout it. He kept me smiling throughout it all,’ said Mr Dixon, who has just returned to work. Now Mr Dixon, who is on the road to recovery, is hoping to pay back the North East charity which helped him through his treatment - the Toma Fund. ‘My mum took me for my treatment in Newcastle every day in her car,’ he said. ‘But then we found out there was a problem with the engine and it would cost £400 to get it fixed. ‘We relied on that car so much and I was facing a two hour round trip on the Metro to go for radiotherapy every day,’ said Mr Dixon. And that is when he was introduced to the Toma Fund, a charity set up by Andrea and Dave Thompson who lost their son, Jordan, to leukaemia when he was 15. The charity hands out grants to children and young people in the North East going through cancer treatment, and helped Mr Dixon to mend the car. Now, to give something back to the charity which helped him so much, Mr Dixon has recruited up to 15 of his clients to run the Great North Run for the Toma Fund.

"A hostile bacteria, seen in Europe for the first time, is destroying centuries-old olive trees and threatening supplies of Italian oil. The microbe, first identified in the Americas, has now infected 800,000 trees in Salento, the southern half of Puglia, the heel of Italy. Puglia produces about 11million tonnes of olives a year, more than a third of the national crop and some of the country's best oils. A hostile bacteria - Xylella fastidiosa - seen in Europe for the first time, is destroying centuries-old olive trees and threatening supplies of Italian oil (file picture) If supplies are significantly affected, it could lead to higher prices for shoppers in Britain and around the world (see box below). Many of Italy's oldest specimens, some 500 years old, have been infected by the bacteria, named Xylella fastidiosa. The species causes plants to dry out, leaving shrivelled stumps that are incapable of bearing fruit. The epidemic has already cost producers €250m (£200m) - a figure expected to rise. Officials have called on experts from the University of California, Berkeley, to help them contain the devastating outbreak. Angelo Corsetti, a spokesman for Coldiretti, the national agricultural organisation, said that growers would be forced to destroy many trees in the worst-afflicted areas when an emergency decree comes into force next week. The bacteria (right) causes plants to dry out, leaving shrivelled stumps that are incapable of bearing fruit . 'The disease is continuing to spread thanks to the summer temperatures and we have to take the right measures. 'There will be a genuine ""cordon sanitaire"" of 8,000 hectares where it will be obligatory to destroy the trees'. The reaction has been slow because of the Italian tradition of going on holiday for the whole of August. Unfortunately, 'Xylella does not go on holiday,' regional president of Coldiretti, Gianni Cantele, said . Anna Maria D'Onghia, head of plant protection at the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Bari, told the Corriere del Mezzorgiorno newspaper that the epidemic had never been seen in Europe before. She said insects are the likely cause of the transmission of the bacteria. The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation has warned that the disease, which can also infect almond and stone fruit trees, is a 'very serious threat' to agriculture. The microbe, first identified in the Americas, has now infected 800,000 trees in Salento, the southern half of Puglia, the heel of Italy . Below is a summary of the Italian virgin olive oil market worldwide, according to Unaprol (organisation of Italian oil producers), showing the main importing countries: . USA: Italy holds a market share of 51 per cent, with exports up 2 per cent in 2013. AUSTRIA: Italy is the market leader in 2013 with a 48 per cent share.

"Scientists are in the process of developing a substance that could be used to create everything from armour to smartphone screens. Nanocellulose, which is made from plant matter that is broken down into tiny pieces, is not only fast and cheap to make, but its creation only requires water, sunshine and time. Scientists claim that they are close to being able to produce the substance from the Acetobacter xylinum bacteria which is used to produce vinegar. Is algae the next super-material? Researchers have found a new method to create Nanocellulose, which can be used in everything from body armour to phone screens. Here, a Chinese man sails his boat along the algae-filled coastline of Qingdao, in eastern China's Shandong province. The substance could be used in a huge range of ways. It is a vegetable compound so could act as a food bulker or a bandage. It could also be used in speakers, computers and cigarette filters . Firms are also experimenting using it in body armour, while others are developing tablet and smartphone screens. Until recently this bacteria could be used to synthesis nanocellulose but it was not possible to make it sufficiently cheaply for it to be useful commercially. However, there is now a new process which involves creating a nanocellulose ‘factory’ in which the algae, when given water, sunlight and time, could produce the substance without intervention. This now means that nanocellulose could be produced in the quantities needed to make it commercially viable. Professor Malcom Brown of the University of Texas said: ‘If we can complete the final steps, we will have accomplished one of the most important potential agricultural transformations ever. ‘We will have plants that produce nanocellulose abundantly and inexpensively. It can become the raw material for sustainable production of biofuels and many other products. ‘While producing nanocellulose, the algae will absorb carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas linked to global warming.’ Is this the next supermaterial? Nanocellulose is made from plant matter that is broken into tiny pieces . It has a long history - In . the 1800s, French scientist Louis Pasteur first discovered that . vinegar-making bacteria make 'a sort of moist skin, swollen, gelatinous . and slippery' - a 'skin' now known as bacterial nanocellulose. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on Earth, a material, like plastics, consisting of molecules linked together into long chains. Cellulose makes up tree trunks and branches, corn stalks and cotton fibers, and it is the main component of paper and cardboard. People eat cellulose in 'dietary fiber,' the indigestible material in fruits and vegetables. Cows, horses and termites can digest the cellulose in grass, hay and wood. Most cellulose consists of wood fibers and cell wall remains. Very few living organisms can actually synthesize and secrete cellulose in its native nanostructure form of microfibrils. At this level, nanometer-scale fibrils are very hydrophilic and look like jelly. A nanometer is one-millionth the thickness of a U.S. dime. Nevertheless, cellulose shares the unique properties of other nanometer-sized materials -- properties much different from large quantities of the same material. Nanocellulose-based materials can be stronger than steel and stiffer than Kevlar. Great strength, light weight and other advantages has fostered interest in using it in everything from lightweight armor and ballistic glass to wound dressings and scaffolds for growing replacement organs for transplantation.","Nanocellulose is made from plant matter that is broken into tiny pieces .

"Since the U.S unleashed the first nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki back in 1945 there have been a staggering 2056 nuclear tests recorded worldwide. It took almost a year until the next substantial tests took place but by the mid-50s and 60s, nuclear experiments were being recorded across the globe on almost a monthly basis. To demonstrate the scale and development of this technology, Japanese artist Isao Hashimoto has plotted all these explosions that took place from 1945 up to 1998 in a time-lapse video map. As the map begins, it zooms into the U.S and a small flashing blue dot is shown on the screen just days before another. These signify the dropping of the Little Bot atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 and the Fat Man bomb on Nagasaki just three days later. As more tests are carried out, the map zooms out to show the whole globe. Every time a country has detonated a nuclear weapon in the past 50 years, a flashing dot appears in above it on the map. The Manhattan Project was set up midway through the Second World War and began work on developing the U.S' nuclear technology. In May 1945 Germany signed a surrender agreement with the Allies to signal the end of the war in Europe, however, the war in the Pacific carried on and the Allies were contemplating invading Japan. They asked Japan to surrender but the Japanese government ignored the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945. By August 1945, the Manhattan Project had developed and tested . atomic bombs at its Los Alamos base and on 6 August, a Little Boy atomic bomb, left, was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, followed by a Fat Man bomb,right, on Nagasaki three days later. The blasts are said to have killed a total of 245,000 deaths by November 1945 and the effects from radiation are still reported to this day. On 15 August, Japan surrendered and signed the Instrument of Surrender on September 2, officially ending World War II. A tally of total bombs dropped is shown in the bottom right-hand corner of the video, as well as a tally that shows how many bombs each individual country has used during that time. Flashes increase further during the early 1960s and by 1998, the U.S tested 1032 while the UK had 45 among others. Hashimoto started the project in 2003 and told Wired he created it with the goal of . showing 'the fear and folly of nuclear weapons.' He was born in 1959 and studied in Tokyo at the department of Arts, Policy and Management. He then got a job . as a curator at the Lalique museum in Hakone, Japan. Because the map runs up to 1998, it doesn't include the tests reported by North Korea in October 2006, May 2009, and February this year.

"The leader of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine has issued a bizarre appeal for British help via UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Denis Pushilin, head of the self-declared 'Donetsk people's republic', sent his plea as Ukrainian forces arrived to crush an uprising against the country's new, pro-EU government. In an email he told Mr Farage that Donetsk was founded by a British engineer and businessman John Hughes in 1870, after he was granted a concession by the Russian government under tsar Alexander II. Nigel Farage, leader of UKIP, is the unlikely recipient of a plea for help from Denis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared 'Donetsk People's Republic' which has staged a revolt against Ukraine's pro-EU government . 'We are appealing not just to fellow Russians, but to the people of Britain,' said Mr Pushilin. 'We believe that Britons, like Russians, are not ""of Europe"" - as Winston Churchill put it - and will not be ""with"" Ukrainian ultra-nationalists, the EU, US and NATO in repressing our identity, our right to speak Russian and our desire to be with Russia as well as to celebrate our historical Russo-British heritage. 'On behalf of the overwhelming majority of the people of Donetsk, we are asking for your support for a referendum on the independence of Donetsk Region. 'We believe that UKIP represents the spirit of the British people more than any other party, and are issuing a ""Mayday"" distress signal. 'The danger of our potential extermination by the Kiev ""authorities"" is hanging over us and anybody, who holds the same views, like a sword of Damocles.' The breakaway leader - who has strong support in Russia - declared: 'We are hoping that you and the people of Britain will respond to our appeal and help Donetsk to defend the right to keep its own identity and our lives, which are endangered by the new ""government"" in Kiev. 'Please stand up for us, like the statue of John Hughes in the centre of our city, a testament to our special relationship, which doesn't have to be a thing of the past. Let us all have a future.' Mr Pushilin pictured last week with separatist militants at pro-Russian meeting in Donetsk: He told Mr Farage that his region shares a joint heritage with Britain thanks to its founder, British engineer John Hughes . Mr Pushilin confirmed that his appeal was genuine. MailOnline contacted UKIP for comment, but no one was available. Last month Mr Farage was accused of being an apologist for Putin after he claimed the EU had 'blood on its hands' over Ukraine. Founder: John Hughes was a Welsh engineer who came to the region in 1870 and for many years Donetsk was named after him - as Hughesovka . Mr Pushilin's 'Donetsk People's Republic' is seen by Kiev and the West as a tool by separatists to help the Russian secret services split east Ukraine from the rest of the country, and put it fully under Moscow's sway. He and his supporters have occupied the main regional government building for ten days, and declared the Donetsk People's Republic with a central demand of a referendum on their future status. They are protected by barricades and armed gunmen wearing balaclavas. His supporters are split between those wanting autonomy within Ukraine and others seeking immediate incorporation by Russia. 'One thing is clear, there will be no May 25 presidential elections for us,' said Mr Pushilin, referring to Kiev's plans for a national poll to elect a new government. Hughes was a Welsh engineer and for many years Donetsk was named after him - as Hughesovka. Later in 1924 it was renamed Stalino after Soviet leader Josef Stalin. Welshman Hughes was born in Merthyr Tydfil and as an an engineer won acclaim for his armaments designs. After switching to the Millwall Iron Works in London, where he designed a gun carriage for heavy cannons, used by the Royal Navy, he received an order from the Russian Imperial government. He was granted land in what is now Donetsk, taking with him around 100 ironworkers and miners from South Wales. He personally established hospitals, schools, bath houses, tea rooms, a fire brigade and an Anglican church in his new town, now a city of almost one million.","Denis Pushilin tells Farage of his region's shared heritage with Britain .

"A new report from Gallup shows that Americans without medical insurance now make up 15.6 per cent of the population, the lowest level since 2008. But the organization hedged its bets when MailOnline asked how Medicaid enrollments might taint its conclusions. Jenna Levy, a Gallup methodologist, wrote Monday that the number, down from a recent high of 18 per cent at the beginning of the six-month Obamacare open enrollment period, is 'a sign that the Affordable Care Act... appears to be accomplishing its goal of increasing the percentage of Americans with health insurance coverage.' Most of the swing toward the insurance rolls, however, has been among populations that have subscribed in large numbers to Medicaid, a low-income benefit program whose costs are borne entirely by taxpayers. Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport backed away from the suggestion that the numbers indicated success for President Barack Obama, telling MailOnline on Monday that Levy merely 'thought that was a reasonable assumption.' 'Really, all we're saying,' he insisted, 'is that the uninsured . level has declined. ... We don't know how many people have paid the . premiums, we don't know how many are on Medicaid.' 'That's why we used the word ""appears"".' Gallup found that the percentage of U.S. residents without medical insurance has dipped to its lowest level since before Barack Obama took office, but hidden in the graph is a surge in Medicaid enrollments whose costs are 100 per cent bore by taxpayers . 'Uninsured' statistics dipped among black Americans faster than in any other ethnic group, tracking with African-Americans' pace of Medicaid participation that far outstrips their population numbers; these women waited in Kansas city last week to sign up for Obamacare . Gallup's data show that 18.0 per cent of U.S. residents lacked medical insurance at the end of the third quarter of 2013, when Obamacare's open enrollment began. That number dropped to 15.6 per cent at the end of March. But the trend-within-a-trend may be that the White House's . push to move Americans into the ranks of the insured has mainly served . to beef up a wealth transfer scheme. A reduction from 18.0 to 15.6 per cent represents about 7 million Americans whom Gallup says became insured in the last six months. MailOnline presented Newport with a scenario in which 1.5 million were previously uninsured private insurance customers with paid policies, and the rest were medicaid enrollees. 'Sure, absolutely,' he said, responding to a question about whether that would cause Gallup to change its mind about Obamacare's success level. There is no deadline for joining Medicaid, which stays open for new enrollments year-round. A MailOnline analysis showed last week that the number of paid private insurance enrollments from Americans who were previously uninsured – in contrast with those who lost their insurance after Obamacare became law and replaced it since October – may be as low as 858,000. Among those genuine new enrollees, . government subsidies will pay for much of the cost. MailOnline based its calculations on a forthcoming RAND Corporation study that only the Los Angeles Times has seen in its entirety. The Times, however, published a few startling details. Just 23 per cent of new Obamacare enrollees had no insurance before signing up, RAND found.  And of those newly insured Americans, just 53 per cent have paid their first month's premiums. The rest, we are left to assume, are on Medicaid. 'We all knew this would be a giant Medicaid boom,' a Department of Health and Human Services official told MailOnline Monday on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to speak publicly. 'It's pretty clear that the president wanted an even bigger one.' 'Whether Gallup spins this as a net gain on insured-versus-uninsured numbers is up to them,' the official continued, 'but they're really comparing apples to oranges unless they separate insurance buyers from people who have it handed to them' [through Medicaid]. Gloating for now: President Barack Obama boasted about signing up 7.1 million Americans for Affordable Care Act insurance coverage, but he didn't say how many had paid their premiums or how many already were insured before his signature law took effect -- and he glossed ove3r the Medicaid enrollment figures . The Gallup report, published online Monday morning, acknowledged that '[t]he uninsured . rate for lower-income Americans dropped 3.2 points to 27.5% – the . largest decline within any key subgroup – while the uninsured rate for . blacks fell 3.3 points to 17.6%.' Low-income U.S. residents are by definition the core constituency of Medicaid. Padding the numbers: Under Obamacare, Americans earning up to 138 per cent of the federal government's poverty-line income can choose free Medicaid coverage . And the Kaiser Family Foundation . has reported that through the year 2012, blacks comprised 20 per cent . of Medicaid benefit recipients. The 2010 U.S. Census found that just . 12.6 per cent of the U.S. population is African-American. Gallup mentioned Medicaid only in the final paragraph of its report – hundreds of words after declaring that the Obamacare system 'appears' to be succeeding. 'Medicaid has likely added millions to its enrollment due to its expansion,' Gallup says, 'although – as with the exchanges themselves – it remains unclear how many were previously insured and moved to Medicaid as a less expensive option.' 'Regardless, the decline in the percentage of uninsured over the course of the first quarter almost certainly includes the effects of expanded Medicaid eligibility policies.' Gallup also notes that it is 'likely ... that not all new enrollees will ultimately pay their insurance premiums, which would result in a subsequent change in status from insured to uninsured at some point later in 2014.' Newport told MailOnline that Gallup will convene a group of journalists on April 16 to 'look at some internal data that we'll be able to analyze by that point.' Those data, he said, may be able to suggest a story behind the sudden drop in the number of uninsured Americans. 'At the moment, this is what we have,' he said, pointing to Monday morning's report. 'If new data come along that suggest something more, then we'll report it.' The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether 'uninsured' percentages will rebound upward as some enrollees fail to pay, and others replace paid insurance with Medicaid after receiving cancellation notices.","A Gallup writer had claimed that shrinking numbers of 'uninsured' Americans was proof Obamacare is 'accomplishing its goal'
But the organization's top editor backed off that claim, agreeing that the number could rocket back up as people fail to pay premiums, and signups for taxpayer-funded Medicaid 'insurance' are factored in .
An HHS official confided that Gallup is comparing apples and oranges unless it separates Medicaid consumers from Americans with private insurance .
Gallup's eidtor-in-chief conceded that his organization's conclusions would have to change, if few paying Obamacare subscribers materialize who were uninsured before the law took effect .
A MailOnline analysis based on forthcoming RAND Corporation numbers showed last week that as few as 858,000 people could fit that description ."

And just hours earlier, Jay Z made his first marquee signing as super middleweight world champion Andre Ward joined his Roc Nation Sports stable. Jay Z's wife Beyonce missed the event as the star studded crowd watched on as welterweight Hernandez-Harrison protected his undefeated record. ‘I think I was made for situations like this,’ Hernandez-Harrison said. ‘The fight itself, I started to get better and better. ‘I wanted the knockout bad. I looked for it too much in the 10th round. Other than that, I’m happy.’ Before Ward put pen to paper, Jay Z had struggled to tempt one of boxing's big names to join his venture. Last August, his chief operating officer David Itskowitch travelled to Puerto Rica with a cheque for $1,904,840 to bid for a middleweight world title fight between champion Peter Quillin and Matt Korobov. Roc Nation Sports won the purse bid, offering $700,000 more than the next highest bid from Golden Boy. But Quillin never did fight Korobov, instead opting to vacate his title and wave goodbye to a $1.4m pay day.

Keith Thurman, meanwhile, rejected a multi-fight deal worth $6m, telling ESPN: 'Jay Z's company is a young company. I haven't seen them make guys money yet in boxing. 'I want to see [Jay Z] do something with another fighter before I follow. I don't want to fly on the first airplane.' But Ward has taken the plunge, tweeting on Friday: 'It's official! Happy to be part of the Roc Nation family.' The boxer has been out of action for 14 months due to disputes with his former promoter but is widely considered one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world. He was the last man to beat British star Carl Froch when they met in the final of the Super Six in Atlantic City in 2011. Ward told ESPN: 'I wholeheartedly believe in Roc Nation Sports and I just believe that they have the vision and the power and resources to carry their vision out.'","Jay Z was promoting his first boxing show at Madison Square Garden .

"Manny Pacquiao is confident his long-awaited mega-fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr will be announced by the end of the month. The fight, which would be worth at least $300million (£197million), is expected to be held at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas with a preferred date of May 2. Pacquiao has consistently called out Mayweather since his lop-sided win over Chris Algieri last November. Manny Pacquiao believes his long-awaited fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr will be announced before February . And he told the Manilla Standard: 'We will make an announcement before the end if the month. I think it will happen.' Mayweather wants to fight on May 2, the Saturday closest to the Cinco de Mayo holiday, as has been his tradition in recent years. But that date has also been earmarked for Miguel Cotto's proposed clash with Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez which would be one of the biggest fights in the history of the Puerto Rico-Mexico rivalry. Mayweather said last month: 'The public want this fight. I want it. the only stumbling block has been Bob Arum (Pacquiao's promoter) but I think both fighters want it. So it's time to get it on. I'm not ducking anyone, so let's get this on. Mayweather Jnr has blamed the long delay for the fight on Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum (above) 'Years ago we had problems with random blood and urine testing. I just want to have an even playing field. 'Now he's in a very, very tight situation with his loss to (Juan Manuel) Marquez and his loss to (Timothy) Bradley. His pay-per-view numbers are extremely low, so he's desperate. I wanted that fight a long time ago.' Reports in America over the weekend suggested the venue had been agreed, as well as a drug testing programme. The final stumbling block appears to be the purse split with Mayweather refusing to agree to a 50/50 division. Mayweather Jnr is keen to fight on May 2 as it is the Saturday closest to the Cinco de Mayo holiday . But Pacquiao has long been adamant that he would accept the smaller portion in order to end more than five years of debate since the fight was first mooted. Before Christmas he told Sky Sports: 'Mayweather can get the amount he wants. I challenged him to a charity fight. Until now, he has not agreed to it. 'So, money is not the issue in our fight. This fight is about legacy, this is about making the fans happy and, above all, this is for the good of boxing. 'He has reached a dead end. He has nowhere to run but to fight me. I will try my best to make this a thrilling and entertaining fight. But I doubt if he's gonna engage me in a slugfest. You all know his fighting style. Most of his previous fights, if not all, induced us to sleep. 'I know what I have to do. I will chase him wherever he goes just in case he decides to run around the ring. We will devise a good fight plan against him.'","The proposed mega-fight would be worth at least $300million .

"Welcome to my first MailOnline boxing column. This is where I’ll be sharing views and news from Matchroom Boxing and the logical place to start is the subject of a Carl Froch-George Groves  re-match. It’s logical because it is a fight I get asked about every day. It’s also something I am working very hard on and I hope to have a more concrete answer in the next two weeks. In the meantime, I can give you an idea of the sorts of discussions that have been going on behind the scenes. We have had a lot of conversations with both fighters and it’s a fight I think needs to happen this year. If we strike a deal, and there’s still some way to go, then it’s a fight I would like to put on in a big stadium on one of the last two Saturdays in May. We have spoken to Wembley and numerous other stadiums already – I believe this fight would draw a crowd of 70,000 or 80,000. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Eddie Hearn's debut MailOnline boxing column . Slugging it out: A re-match between Carl Froch (left) and George Groves would be massive . Fast start: Groves (right), caught Froch unawares with the ferocity of his attack in the early stages . Hold it right there: Referee Howard Foster stopped the fight in the ninth, leading to a controversial win for Froch . The important factor in all this is what Carl wants. He is the unified champion and in the closing stages of his career he has dreams and aspirations, especially to fight in Las Vegas. Groves has options and has spoken to other promoters, but obviously he wants Carl most. And the public want this fight so much – they want answers as to what may have happened after that fantastic fight and the controversy of George being stopped. Carl has four options – a rematch with WBA super-middleweight champion Andre Ward, who beat Carl in 2011; Gennady Golovkin, the middleweight world champion; Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr, the former middleweight champion. Then there’s Groves. We all know about George. To my mind, the Ward fight, commercially speaking, is not big enough. The only reason for them to fight is Carl wants revenge, but he wants it badly. The money is not comparable for the Ward fight to the Groves and Chavez fight. Chavez is an easier fight, if you ask me, but politically it would be tough because of the re-match clauses and the money Chavez wants. I don’t see many reasons for Golovkin to move from middleweight and I have been told by various sources that their team believes Carl is the toughest fight out there. That’s the fight his people ooh, ah and wince at. It would be a truly great fight between two warriors, but I don’t think Golovkin is quick enough or awkward enough to grit it out with Carl at 168lbs. Laying out his vision: MailOnline's new columnist Eddie Hearn would love to organise the Froch-Grove re-match . is the door open? Hearn says the public appetite for a Froch-Groves re-match is massive . With Groves, we know his demands and it is too much, but having not really entered the negotiation period properly, I still believe we can find some middle ground. At the moment, we are putting the options together and forecasting the financials and saying: ‘Right, these are the fights and these are the numbers.’ If you ask me I’ll always go with the one with the biggest numbers unless it is very close and one fight is easier or in Las Vegas, where Carl has always wanted to fight. My gut feeling is that it will happen this year. I spoke about it with Carl last week. We talked about the fact it is a big fight and that it will still be around down the line but I don’t agree with that. If Groves takes another fight and loses, his value would diminish, and if he wins, he may want a greater split which would make it more difficult to negotiate. Carl has made a career out of giving the public what they want but he really doesn’t like Groves. Last time, George was the mandatory challenger so Carl had no choice but to fight him or lose the belt. Now, in Carl’s mind, there is no reason to fight George other than the money and the fact it is what the people want to see. Pride? I don’t think he feels in his head that he has a lot to prove, but at the same point, the animosity between the two could potentially drive him like never before. Get it off the ground: One of the most important factors is whether Froch wants the re-match . He won the fight, although he does feel it was stopped too early. He wishes it would have gone on 10 or 15 seconds because he’s convinced he would have finished it in devastating fashion. I, like many, believe he would have gone on to win the fight – but these unanswered questions make this potentially the biggest bout in British boxing history. Even now, a couple of months after the fight, I can’t quite believe how good the fight was. Styles make fights and that is why Groves was wrong for Carl with his speed and movement. He surprised me with how well he did, even though everyone in boxing knows what power George has. I was there at the press conference when George said he was going to stand and trade in the middle of the ring. To be honest, after that press conference, that was the first time I thought Carl was going to be absolutely fine. I always thought he would win, but that made me certain. I thought Groves had looked worried in the face-off and was nervous. Obviously I was wrong. George was fantastic – I had him two rounds up at the time of the stoppage. Not firing: Despite his victory, Froch was not as tuned in for the Groves fight as he was for his clashes against Mikkel Kessler (below left) and Lucian Bute (below right) When you look back at the night, in the changing room beforehand, Carl wasn’t firing. For Mikkel Kessler and Lucian Bute he was so ready. This time, it was very cold in the room. Everyone was rushing around and the mood was just a bit off. I thought the problem was Carl’s hunger, like: ‘What have I got to prove here?’ I think Carl likes to prove people wrong. He had that in his rematch against Kessler, having lost their first fight, and he was fighting to save his career against Bute. They were probably two of his best fights. Carl didn’t have that hungry mindset against Groves. If we make this fight, I am convinced he would. I have always like the Daily Mail’s boxing coverage. I remember spending some time with Jeff Powell a few years ago when I was promoting Audley Harrison. Jeff had come out to join us at Big Bear Mountain in California, where Audley was training for his fight with David Haye. We had heard that three murderers were on the loose and hiding out in the mountains, which was a bit of a talking point while we were up there. Anyway, Jeff and I went out with Audley and a few of his entourage one morning for a run up the mountain. After a while, we heard this noise from the side of the road and then three guys wearing Scream masks jumped out from behind a rock and they were holding bats. I thought I was going to have a heart attack. It turned out it was three of Audley’s sparring partners. Running scared: Jeff Powell (second left) on a training jog with Audley Harrison (left) and his entourage, one of whom (second right) appears to be holding a 'Scream' mask . My aim for 2014 is more domestic fights. I love a good domestic fight – the storyline is often that much better and you know what you are getting with British fighters. You can watch a Mexican on YouTube, and he can look great, but then you fly them all the way over here and they don’t fancy it. Give me a proper fight. I always say to the foreign agents: ‘Tell them to try their nuts off because I want to watch a proper fight and I am paying the purse.' There’s nothing worse than my fighter getting an easy night because then no one gets value for money. Exciting: But you'll have to read Eddie's thoughts on Anthony Joshua (centre) in his next session . You know what you are getting with a domestic fight and our show on February 1 in Cardiff is looking superb. We have Lee Selby fighting world title challenger Rendall Munroe for the European and British featherweight titles and that is going to be excellent. Former world champion Gavin Rees is also fighting Gary Buckland and then we have Anthony Joshua fighting against Dorian Darch. I can’t tell you enough how excited I am by Anthony Joshua. I’ll save what I think about him for another column.","Top boxing promoter's brilliant debut MailOnline column .

"Would you fancy your chances in the ring against David Haye, Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the world? I foolishly thought I should give it a go last Sunday at his Hayemaker Gym in Vauxhall, London. Me vs David Haye. Mano a mano. Most fighters would have at least three months preparation for a fight, I had scarcely three hours sleep the night before and was looking a bit worse for wear. Sparry eyed: Spencer Matthews took on heavyweight champion David Haye in the ring . Spencer (left) faced the champion after only three hours sleep with help of the gym's trainers (right) It had been a heavy night. A couple of friends had come in from New York and wanted to be shown London’s night-life. We started off with drinks at the Sanctum Soho Hotel and then on to hot new West End club Chakana. At the club we bumped into an old friend Caggie Dunlop and the promises I’d made to myself that I would have a quiet one prior to my Sunday morning boxing session were evaporating fast. To make things worse I had broken my nose only the day before. A girl had accidentally elbowed me in the face (she said it was an accident and I’ll have to take her word for it), but she connected with such force that blood was streaming from the bridge of my nose and the bone was chipped. So picture if you will, the look on the former WBA Heavyweight Champion’s face as I’m telling him to go easy on me because a girl broke my nose recently and I’ve got a bit of a hangover. I asked if we could forego the boxing session and just do some photos together to publicise his new gym and boxing training sessions, he said no. The only thing I could do to make things better was to pop a Forza T5 Super Strength capsule to give me some extra energy and concentration before I went into the ring. I was given a quick lesson by David’s trainers Ruben Tabares and Peter Marcasciano on how to jab, hook and throw some combinations when in the ring with David. The tuition came in handy but it didn't prepare me for David's imposing presence and intense stare, just holding a punch pad in one hand he looked menacing. Spencer gears up to take on David Haye . Spencer asked David if he could forego the boxing session as he had a bit of a hangover. David said no. David held up a hand for me and asked me to punch it as hard as I could. He moved his hand away long before my punch went anywhere close. I was nowhere near fast enough. Following some supervision and guidance from David I started to improve and got into the swing of things and threw some good right hooks into the pad but after about ten minutes I started to realise that the fitness levels needed for boxing are off the hook. As I bent over out of breath David laughed and gave me a playful kick on the backside. I gained some confidence as the session went on and at one point in the video you can see me starting to get a bit cocky and I even faced off with David (one minute six seconds in) – like I would stand a chance if he launched a punch back. Spencer advises having a nice early night before you contemplate going to the Hayemaker Gym . This is a great work-out, and also a great lesson in self-defence for both men and women – and there were several women at the session that morning. The Hayemaker training camp provides two hour elite training and conditioning sessions to the general public at affordable prices. It also gives members of the public the opportunity to train with, and use the same facilities as former WBA Champion David Haye. My only advice is to have a nice early night before you contemplate going. The sessions are open to all from age 14+ regardless of fitness levels. For more information, please visit www.hayemakertrainingcamp.com or email hayemaker@geniusbrand.co.uk for direct bookings.","Spencer took on heavyweight champion David Haye at his Gym in Vauxhall .

"Manny Pacquiao's proposed fight with Floyd Mayweather took another step closer after he agreed terms with his promoter.

"Nick Clegg has promised to end what he calls the ‘nightmare’ of high childcare bills by subsidising the cost of nursery places. The Deputy Prime Minister believes it is absurd that hundreds of thousands of women feel it is not worth returning to work after having a baby because the cost of childcare is prohibitively high. So he has put forward a series of measures for consideration. Perhaps, he suggests, the Government should think about increasing the State-funded free childcare allowance for three and four-year-olds from 15 hours a week to 25. I have to take issue with Mr Clegg. Nick Clegg has pledged to end the 'nightmare' of high child care bills, but Kathy Gyngell takes issue with the Deputy Prime Minister . I wonder whether in the clamour to throw ever more money into the insatiable maw of childcare provision he has addressed the controversial notion that some mothers may actually want to stay at home and raise their pre-school infants themselves? Twenty-five years ago, when it was considered a betrayal of all the feminist sisterhood had fought for, I abandoned a well-paid and prestigious career in television — I was features editor on TV-am — to be a full-time mum. I had not intended to relinquish work. Indeed, I had employed a nanny to look after my first son so I could race back to the studio to pursue my absorbing and lucrative career. But I had not reckoned on the anxiety, the palpitations, the sheer distress I felt at leaving my year-old baby in the care of someone else. I managed to juggle work and home for 11 months, but I was so racked with sorrow and yearning that, in the end, I capitulated. I gave up work to look after my first son, then remained at home when my second was born. That my boys have grown into two well-adjusted, talented and fulfilled young men is not, I flatter myself, entirely unconnected with the fact that I decided to bring them up myself. I was fortunate. At the time, my husband Bruce was a well-paid TV executive, and although I was widowed 12 years ago, as a young mum I was not compelled to work because we did not need the income from a second salary. Many women are not so blessed. There are millions of hard-pressed families in the ‘squeezed middle’ who cannot manage on one income. But there are also many who would prefer to remain at home looking after their pre-school age children if they could afford to. And my fear is that Nick Clegg — perpetuating the myth propagated by the last Labour government that all mothers should go back to work and indeed want to do so — is trying to dragoon them all back into the workplace with this new initiative. Denmark and its working mother-of-two Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, pictured, is apparently the inspiration for Mr Clegg's vision . What Mr Clegg has failed to address is the question at the core of the debate: is it in a child’s best interests to be cared for outside the home? Denmark, run by Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, herself a mother of two daughters, is apparently the source of his inspiration. The country is certainly a brave new world of enforced gender equality. Christine Antorini, its Minister for Children and Education, makes Labour’s equality evangelist Harriet Harman seem positively reasonable. Ms Antorini has described being asked to stay at home to care for your own children as ‘the biggest punishment’ there could be. Her policies, which devote a greater proportion of national income to childcare than does Britain, ensure that 90 per cent of women return to work after childbirth. Her view is that it is no longer ‘normal’ to want to stay at home. But before Mr Clegg gets seduced by the Danish model for childcare, perhaps he should question whether it is one we should aspire to here in Britain — because even the Danes are beginning to ask if their model is worth the cost. For although Danish women have been pushed into paid work for decades, analysts believe widespread take-up of childcare is actually the reason for a deterioration of women’s position in the labour market. The irony is that rising female employment — far from pushing women into professional and managerial occupations — has been associated with a growing number of women occupying less well-paid and lower-status jobs in the service sector. And the same thing is happening in the UK, too. Nor is it beneficial to children to be herded off to a nursery where there is a high turnover of often poorly- qualified, badly-paid, inexperienced and hard-pressed staff who cannot possibly have the same interest in the well-being of their charges as their own mothers do. It is a controversial view, but I believe it amounts to cruelty to force a mother to abandon her newborn to the care of another. It is cruel to the parent — and also cruel to the child. Countless studies have found that small children need to form a bond — inalienable and constant — with one carer. When they are being looked after, en masse, by a succession of different ones it is more likely, research has shown, that they will have behavioural problems later. An infant’s need for attachment is much more likely to be met by its mother than by a parade of transient carers in a nursery full of babies and toddlers. Working mother combining her job with looking after her baby (file picture). Kathy Gyngell questions whether Mr Clegg has considered that some women would rather stay at home and take care of baby than rush back to work . So what is the solution? I don’t believe the Government should tell parents to stop work and stay at home with their children. That would be a retrograde step, and as wrong-headed as forcing all women back into the workplace after giving birth. Every mother should simply be given the right to choose. So rather than subsidising day-care, the State should spend the money on tax allowances for all mothers. This would have two benefits. It would recognise the cost and social value of raising children and give mums who want to stay at home a financial incentive to do so. If allowances were based on the number of adults and dependent children living together in a family, parents would then be able to decide whether to set their tax allowances against nurseries or childminders — or whether simply to use them to enable them to stay at home. The system would be more equitable than the one Nick Clegg is proposing and would lead to a more compassionate, forward-thinking and  family-oriented childcare policy. The statistics, after all, are unequivocal. Three years ago, a YouGov poll found that only 1 per cent of mothers actually want to go out to work full-time while their children are pre-school age. Surely political expediency, if nothing else, would suggest that the Government should consider the views and preferences of the other 99  per cent?","Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has promised an end to the 'nightmare' of high child care costs .
