"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China's Health Ministry strengthened surveillance and dispatched specialists to the eastern Anhui province as the death toll from a virulent virus climbed to 22, the Xinhua News Agency reported. A girl suffering from an Enterovirus 71 infection receives treatment this week in a Fuyang, China, hospital. The number of reported cases of the virus in children rose to 3,736 early Saturday in the hardest-hit city of Fuyang, according to the state-run news agency. There were 3,321 reported cases Friday in Fuyang. Xinhua reported that 4,529 children have been sickened in 15 cities in Anhui province. The virus -- called Enterovirus 71, or EV71 -- can cause hand, foot and mouth disease. It's often confused with foot-and-mouth disease in livestock, but the diseases aren't the same, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An Anhui province official, Wang Yan, told Xinhua that 978 children are hospitalized, including 48 in critical condition. ""Authorities in Anhui ... are doing the utmost to treat the children and strengthen disease control,"" he said. The virus is another concern for Chinese officials as the nation prepares to host the Summer Olympics, which open August 8 in Beijing. Anhui province is south of the Chinese capital. The Health Ministry issued a pamphlet Saturday urging local health bureaus to step up prevention and control of infectious diseases as the Olympics approach, Xinhua reported. In milder cases, EV71 can cause coldlike symptoms, diarrhea and sores on the hands, feet and mouth, according to the journal Genetic Vaccines and Therapy. But more severe cases can cause fluid to accumulate on the brain, resulting in polio-like paralysis and death, according to the journal. There is no effective antiviral treatment for severe EV71 infections, and no vaccine is available. Adults' well-developed immune systems usually can fend off the virus, but children are vulnerable to it, according to the CDC. There was a large outbreak of the virus in Taiwan in 1998 with 78 deaths, and smaller outbreaks recurred in 2000 and 2001, the CDC said. Wang Jinshan, secretary of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, visited hospitals in Fuyang on Friday and called for a long-term system to prevent such outbreaks, Xinhua said. In addition, 45 medical specialists have arrived in the city. Anhui has upgraded its public health emergency status from Class 3 to Class 2, meaning the provincial government can quarantine patients and control movement in to and out of Fuyang. In a statement Friday, the World Health Organization noted that the number of hospitalized cases has gradually risen since late March, with a sharp increase in the number of cases since April 19. Public health officials expect the number of cases to peak in June or July, the WHO said. ""Chinese health authorities have put in place targeted prevention and control measures in Fuyang city and Anhui province, including enhanced surveillance, training of health care workers at all levels in treatment, prevention and control, strengthening of environmental health management and the supervision and monitoring of drinking water quality,"" the WHO statement said. ""A public awareness campaign is ongoing, stressing the need for good personal hygiene, mostly by hand washing.""

"(CNN) -- A 32-year-old Texas man was killed Saturday in a shark attack while scuba diving off the coast of Western Australia, police said. The man was scuba diving with two friends near Rottnest Island, considered a popular tourist destination located about 15 miles off the mainland, when the attack occurred. The friends, who were not in the water at the time, noticed an abnormal amount of air bubbles rise to the surface from where the man was diving followed by a plume of blood, according to police spokesman Michael Wear. Moments later, the man's body rose to the surface, Wear said. The man is believed to have been killed by a great white shark, authorities said after a preliminary review of the teeth marks. ""He was in the water by himself, I believe,"" Sgt. Greg True told CNN affiliate Channel Nine. ""There's been some pretty massive injuries inflicted."" Police say the man succumbed to his injuries shortly after the attack. The victim's name was not immediately released, pending notification of family members. He had been living in Western Australia. Saturday's attack is the second fatal shark attack in the past two weeks near the capital of Perth. CNN's Jeremy Ryan contributed to this report .","NEW: The man was scuba diving with friends at the time of the attack .

"(CNN) -- It's been 15 years since Darius and Nina fell in love after that pivotal poetry reading in Chicago, but fans of ""Love Jones"" are still talking about the pair's epic romance. A highbrow, dramatic love story between two young African-Americans, ""Love Jones"" grossed a mere $12 million at the domestic box office in 1997, but it has an enduring cult following that can certainly be attributed to the film's authenticity. One month after ""Love Jones' "" 15th anniversary, however, ""Think Like A Man"" earned more than $39 million domestically in its first week. Featuring a predominantly African-American ensemble cast, the film adaptation of Steve Harvey's best-selling nonfiction book, raises a frequent question: Is Hollywood finally ready to support more movies featuring African-American love? The creators behind these stories have hoped the answer to that question would be ""yes"" ""a million times"" before, said ""Love and Basketball"" writer/director Gina Prince-Bythewood. ""Maybe ('Think Like A Man') is the spark."" Filmmakers say Hollywood executives, often citing humble box office numbers, can be skeptical when it comes to pouring money into African-American productions. Prince-Bythewood's 2000 movie, for example, is still a fan favorite but earned just $27 million domestically in theaters. Keith Merryman and David A. Newman, who wrote the screenplay for ""Think Like A Man,"" say it's difficult to get financing for a black film. The film only had $12.5 million to play with, but given its box office success thus far, the men hope bigger budgets will increasingly be available to films featuring actors of color. With the exception of Taraji P. Henson's character, Lauren, who was written as an African-American, Merryman and Newman said, they ""didn't know what color the whole thing was going to be going in."" Their main concern, Newman said, was exploring the universal differences between men and women. The pair said they have an interracial couple they wanted in the film and their race ""is never commented on,"" but the couple's problems stem from the fact that he refuses to grow up and be a man. ""African-American filmmakers, we know the audience is there,"" ""Love & Basketball's"" Prince-Bythewood said. ""It's just, the films that are made are not always as great as they can be, so when one fails, they think, 'the African-American audience isn't going,' as opposed to, 'it wasn't a very good movie.' "" ""Love Jones"" writer/director Theodore Witcher adds that when one action movie fails at the box office, nobody assumes it's because people aren't interested in seeing action movies. But that's been the case with romantic dramas. ""There's a dearth of love stories in general,"" said Witcher, who's currently working on a ""Love Jones"" sequel. ""You don't see a lot of romantic dramas from Hollywood of any kind. ... By the time that concept trickles down to black people, there's nothing really."" Most of the movies starring African-American casts that do feature a love story are meant to be comedic and aimed at a very specific audience, Prince-Bythewood said. (Even ""Think Like A Man,"" which rests on its love stories, is very much a comedy.) And although Tyler Perry's films routinely attract moviegoers, studios seem to view his movies as a separate genre, she continued. ""I would love to just obliterate this idea of black film being a genre,"" she said. ""It shouldn't be a genre. There should just be films with African-American casts."" ""Think Like A Man"" might have attracted a more mainstream audience because of the way it was marketed. There were advertisements for the film all over the place, Prince-Bythewood said. It appeared to target a much wider demographic than films like ""Love & Basketball"" and ""Love Jones,"" she added. Whether the flick will continue to draw crowds in its second weekend at the box office remains to be seen, but its performance to date might be enough to warrant more films of its kind -- and quite possibly a sequel, as one of the film's stars, Kevin Hart, recently suggested. When a movie like ""Think Like A Man"" comes out, audiences flock to theaters, Prince-Bythewood said. ""There's a huge audience out there, starved for content.""","After ""Love Jones' "" 15th anniversary, ""Think Like A Man"" earns $39 million .

"(CNN) -- During Uganda's 2011 presidential election, when activists and poll workers tried to text criticisms of the incumbent or the evidence of polling fraud, they found their messages wouldn't go through. Yet there was no problem sending innocuous messages about the weather or what they had for lunch. ""So much of communication in Africa and many other continents and countries are dependent on mobile providers that could turn against you all of a sudden -- or could go down,"" Jon Gosier told me in a recent phone interview. He is a man who is likely to change all that. In Uganda's case, the government was monitoring text messages sent among activists and poll watchers. Gosier said that was designed to censor dissent. The lessons: Texts aren't always private and governments are pretty much always nosy. Those are just a couple of reasons Gosier's work with a new nonprofit called Abayima, Luganda for ""guardian,"" is so crucial to the future of free speech in the developing world. I like to think of Gosier as the savior of the SIM card, that humble piece of hardware that's stuck in the back of your cell phone and helps it communicate with the network. That old school and overlooked piece of technology could help human rights advocates, protesters and relief workers communicate during a crisis -- both by serving as an encrypted tool for passing messages and, potentially, helping cell phones communicate with rogue network towers that go up when governments take down communications or natural disasters crumble the existing infrastructure. At a time when governments are getting savvier about using technology to stamp out free speech, these sorts of scrappy tech tools are needed more than ever. Earlier this week, Twitter released a ""transparency report"" saying government requests for its data increased 19% during the second half of last year. Google has called the rise in government censorship requests alarming. While some countries made gains in 2012 in terms of granting free expression, several, including Italy, Mali and Tajikistan, lost points in a recent ranking from Freedom House. Abayima's efforts to fight censorship are the reason it's part of my new CNN Opinion column, which focuses on human rights and social justice issues. I'm a former technology writer, so some columns will highlight technological innovation. Others will focus on how people are using the Internet to create social change and on human rights crises that aren't making it into mainstream headlines. Last year, I worked with the CNN Freedom Project to produce a story on slavery in Mauritania. I've also covered topics like Internet and gaming addiction in South Korea and prisons in Norway. Soon, you will see me writing and fronting a project called Change the List. The pilot was on Hawaii, the state with the lowest voter turnout. I reported from there and enlisted people on the Internet to try to help move that state up ""the List."" Not that I can take credit (and not that it's an insanely huge victory), but the state tied for 49th place in 2012, instead of 50th. It's not everything, but it's progress. Anyway, back to SIM cards. Other people also are catching on to Gosier's concept, too. ""In parts of the world where the Internet is either down or monitored,"" Justin Ellis writes for the Nieman Journalism Lab, ""Abayima would give activists, human rights workers, and journalists the ability to communicate simply by swapping SIMs."" The blog TechPresident calls it a ""handy lo-tech solution to fight censorship."" The Knight Foundation recently gave the nonprofit a $150,000 grant. In a sense, the already-old-news SIM card could take on a new life as the technological grandchild of the fax machine, which helped activists in the Soviet Union communicate with the broader world and each other; or the cassette tape, which helped anti-Apartheid radio hosts in South Africa disseminate their broadcasts to townships. So the SIM is the new fax machine, but in a good way. If all of it sounds a little utopian, maybe it is. Gosier is gambling that several systems fall into place to make these types of communication work-arounds possible. But he's betting on the right technologies. There are 4.5 billion mobile phones in the developing world, according to data compiled by USAID, and many of them are ""feature phones"" -- not-so-smart devices that only make calls and send text messages. When crisis hits, the phone is the device people turn to first for help. Gosier's work builds on that of other crisis-technology developers. And its first step is a tiny one: to create software that will make it easier for programmers to control and write to SIM cards. That's harder than it might sound, though, since the good-guy hackers have to use 1s and 0s, not elaborate code, to talk with the hardware SIMs. With a staff of three, Abayima is working on open-source software, called Open Sim Kit, to do just that. But the group is seeking volunteers to help. If you know anyone who is fluent in machine language, e-mail Gosier at jon@abayima.com. From there, it could become possible for the SIMs to communicate with rogue cell phone towers -- maybe 10 feet tall -- that could be set up in response to a humanitarian crisis like the Haiti earthquake or a communications blackout like those seen in Egypt, Libya or Syria. Those towers and the altered SIM cards could make it possible for small groups of people to communicate over a network, Gosier said. ""The technology is there,"" Gosier told me. ""The problem has been the phones people have can't talk to the towers. So this open source software we're trying to build would allow you to essentially flash SIM cards and distribute them to people. ... At that point they could talk to whatever networks they want."" Until then, the Open Sim Kit could be used by activists to pass digital information to each other, often by hand. Sasha Kinney, who works with journalists and activists in Kenya as part of a group called Pawa254, said even that simple update ""would definitely be something of interest"" for journalists trying to evade government censorship. ""The more offline we can get and the more creative we can get the better it is for us,"" she said. ""And everybody's got a cell phone here."" Election monitors in Kenya also plan to use SIM cards to record information about polling places and election-related violence, Gosier said. They'll pass them off to coordinators by hand, who then will take them to a place where the data can be uploaded to the Internet. In a sense, that makes the SIM card a substitute for paper. But, unlike paper, SIM cards can be encrypted and stored discretely. They're less likely to catch the eyes of authorities. ""Think of it like passing around a thumb drive,"" he said. A thumb drive that costs about 25-cents -- and doesn't require a computer. Which is why the SIM card -- and other affordable, ubiquitous technologies -- is likely to make a comeback as a modern vehicle for free speech. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Abayima is creating software that could be used to hack SIM cards .

"New York (CNN) -- Columbia University is seeking to alter the 1920 charter of one of its graduate school fellowships which is still limited ""to persons of the Caucasian race,"" though the fellowship has not been granted in years. The Lydia C. Roberts Graduate Fellowship is, at least on paper, available to white students ""of either sex, born in the state of Iowa,"" according to a Columbia University charter from 1920. The university filed an affidavit in Manhattan Supreme Court last week to support a petition from JPMorgan Chase, the fellowship's designated trustee, to change the whites-only provision, according to Robert Hornsby, assistant vice president for media relations at Columbia. Other restrictions for the fellowship stipulate that a recipient may not concentrate their studies in ""law, medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, or theology."" Recipients must also agree to return to Iowa for two years after completing their studies at Columbia. The fellowship was established in 1920 by Lydia C. Roberts, an Iowa native, with a $500,000 donation to the university upon her death. However, the school stopped awarding the fellowship in 1997 for several reasons. It's not clear when the university stopped adhering ""to the race-related terms of the gift,"" Hornsby explained. ""The university administers gifts in accordance with applicable law and (anti-discrimination) policies, and it has long been the university's practice to disregard donor restrictions that violate either the law or our policies,"" he added. Douglas Gross, an attorney in Des Moines, Iowa, received the fellowship in 1977 after a college professor recommended it to him. Gross says he was an Iowan interested in pursuing higher education so he accepted, but probably would have rejected the fellowship had he known the provision existed. Some student groups at other universities have established ""whites-only"" scholarships, including Boston University's College Republicans, which created the ""Caucasian Achievement and Recognition"" scholarship in 2006. It awarded $250 to students with at least a 3.2 GPA and who are at least ""one quarter Caucasian."" However, a representative for College Republicans at Boston University says there are no longer any scholarships funded by the organization. ""Our club does not currently offer scholarships of any kind. Our club started from scratch this past fall as the previous College Republicans' student group was ultimately defunct,"" Mara Mellstrom told CNN. Roger Williams University's College Republicans attempted to create a similar scholarship in 2004. In 2003, Texas Tech University student Matt Coday created the United White Person's College Fund, a scholarship that looked to serve ""as a source of financial assistance to students whom Coday feels have been discriminated against by organizations designed to give money to minorities,"" according to the Texas Tech newspaper University Daily. It's not clear if that fund still exists.","The fellowship has not been awarded since 1997, the university says .
The terms of the fellowship required recipient to be a white Iowan .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have charged a 44-year-old man with attempted murder after an early morning shooting at a bar in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, police said Tuesday. Suspect Nathan Van Wilkins was charged with 17 counts of attempted murder in the shooting, which occurred at 12:30 a.m. Tuesday at the Copper Top bar near the University of Alabama campus, Tuscaloosa Police Sgt. Brent Blankley said. Wilkins also faces another attempted murder charge for a shooting earlier that night in a nearby subdivision, he said. Wilkins was in the Tuscaloosa County Jail Tuesday night with a $2 million bond, Blankley said. Police were confident Wilkins was the shooter ""based on some of the things he's told us,"" Police Chief Steve Anderson said earlier Tuesday. No weapon had been recovered, he added. Tuesday afternoon, the suspect went into a business in Jasper, about 50 miles north of Tuscaloosa, and ""indicated he was involved in the incident,"" Anderson said. He was taken into custody by police there and returned to Tuscaloosa. Surveillance video showed a man walking up to the bar, standing outside for a few minutes looking for someone and then beginning to shoot a military-style assault rifle, Anderson said. Tuscaloosa police Sgt. Brent Blankley said 17 people were admitted to DCH hospital with injuries related to the shooting. Anderson could not confirm how many of those admitted were shot and how many were injured by shrapnel or flying objects. Of those hurt, he said, one was in ""extremely critical"" condition, and three others were in critical condition. Police will work with federal authorities to enhance the surveillance footage, he said. Eleven shell casings have been recovered, Blankley said. The casings will be compared with those from a shooting that happened in a nearby neighborhood earlier in the evening, Anderson said. DCH hospital briefly went on lockdown after the incident in order to handle the influx of patients. Arrest made in slain Alabama twins case . Riley Dunn, a University of Alabama senior who was injured in the shooting, told The Tuscaloosa News that 80 to 90 people were in the bar at the time. ""We were all just shooting pool and hanging out,"" Dunn said. ""It was kind of loud from the music, but we heard the gunshot, and no one really knew what to think. The first gunshot took place, then about 20 seconds later, that's when he really started firing them off. After that, everyone really scattered."" Dunn said he suffered a shrapnel-like wound to his leg. Anderson said three of the people injured during the shooting were students. Justin McDaniel, who was with Dunn at the scene, told The Tuscaloosa News that the injured left trails of blood outside the bar. He wasn't injured, but his shirt had large splotches of blood on it from running through the bar, the newspaper said. ""We started getting away from the gunshot, like going towards out front, and that's where all the shooting really took place at,"" one witness told CNN affiliate WBMA. All he could see, he said, were ""sparks and people ducking and glass busting. ... We never saw the guy shooting.""

Justin Stanfield Thomas, 35, and his son made an unannounced trip Friday to the home of an unidentified former roommate, police said. Thomas had previously lived in the residence, according to investigators. ""This appears to be an accident. There was no conflict in the stories of those in the house,"" said Prescott Valley Police Sgt. Brandon Bonney. ""The resident didn't know his former roommate was stopping by to visit.""

"(CNN) -- It's the greatest magic trick in the world. This act of wizardry is performed hundreds of millions of times every day with the press of a button, or more increasingly, with a gentle tap of the screen -- and poof, time stops. The magic is photography. Today, we're taking and uploading more than 200 million images per day via Facebook alone. Our phones have become our recording devices. Or as I like to see it: My camera can also make calls. Smartphones have ushered in a golden age for photography. But disappointingly, much of the conversation has been focused on the device and the use of faux nostalgic filters rather than on how photographers can choose from a wide range of possibilities to be creative. Art photography: When reality isn't good enough . We mustn't forget -- a magician's props, like a photographer's choice of camera, are only part of the illusion created. When the rabbit is pulled from the hat, its color or breed is irrelevant. What's important is the magician's ability to artfully make the rabbit appear and ultimately evoke astonishment from the audience. In photography, the equivalent is taking an image that evokes strong feelings, regardless of which device captured the picture or its nostalgic hue. Smartphones have democratized photography, and Instagram, in particular, has given us an unprecedented platform for our snapshots. But instead of marveling at all the choices, there's some grumbling. Some professionals feel threatened as they see the playing field leveling; they interpret it as the end of skill and craft in photography. They should have no fear of such a thing. 12 tips to become a better smartphone photographer . Photography is rooted in the rich culture of amateurism. What's happening today is similar to the original proliferation of Kodak's Brownie camera starting in 1900. An inexpensive and easy-to-use camera in every hand didn't usher in the end of photography or automatically turn everybody into Richard Avedon. Photo apps won't magically give Jane the smartphone photographer a better sense of composition, or lighting, or framing. The apps and filters only change a photo's look and aesthetic feel. That doesn't make it a better photo. If you put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig. Photographing with a smartphone . For me, photography is my memory. I've chosen photography to prove that I exist. I see my captured view of the world as my search for meaning. For me, words are often inadequate, so I choose to define my experiences with photographs. This little act of magic does not divorce me -- as the critic Susan Sontag implied in her book, ""On Photography"" -- from the here and now. In fact, it deepens my bond to the present moment. An image I take, sprinkled with synthetic nostalgia, tells all: ""I was here and this is what I saw."" The camera phone allows me to offer a small taste of my here and now, on unprecedented levels, to a global audience with astonishing immediacy. Why I use filters . The pictures of my childhood had a warmish, faded, slightly out of focus feeling. They are the memory of things past, comfort food for the eyes. It seems natural for me to add the option of nostalgic filters to my photographic process. When we discover an old, faded, cracked and torn image, we handle it with care and respect. Time has honored it with its blessing. My digital images, however, will never see the ravages of time. They'll always remain, preserved, pristine and forever in their original state, in the perfection of now, without the possibility of the flaws of the past creeping in and eroding it. I want my memories, like the prints of my childhood, to fade, to mix with the ether of all that has come before. Because I know that time cannot touch my digital images, I add in the passage of time by using filters. Embracing the present . It is all about time. It's about the time we are losing, and what the future will do to our memories. It's about the fact that technology can instantaneously compress our collective thoughts and images into binary digits of 1's and 0's. We have a sea of images now. On the horizon, I see the forming of a new photographic language. Let's embrace photography, as it exists now. And let's continue to find our individual voice, perspectives, stories and style, regardless of the medium.

"Washington (CNN) -- For both presidential campaigns, Republican Mitt Romney's choice of Wisconsin congressman and conservative star Paul Ryan as his running mate was like Christmas come early. Conservatives wanted one of their own on Romney's ticket and they got that in Ryan, who has emerged as their ideological leader on the Hill on fiscal and budget matters. The choice also helps satisfy Republican strategists who felt Romney needed to not only stress how President Barack Obama has failed in that role, but also better articulate what the GOP candidate would do if elected. ""Ryan is a great choice. He energizes an already motivated party to a further degree and will help clarify the differing visions between the two campaigns for the country,"" said Phil Musser, a GOP strategist who in 2007 was a senior adviser to Romney's presidential campaign. ""There are big choices, and in making the selection, Romney is showing that he believes America is ready for the choice."" But Romney's choice of Ryan also helps Obama better define what he's running against -- his campaign immediately made the Wisconsin congressman and his ""extreme"" budget a target and tied Romney's campaign to Ryan's House Republican colleagues, who he says wants to get rid of regulations on big corporations and give more tax breaks to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. Romney's introduction of Ryan dominated the news over the weekend with debates of the Wisconsin congressman's policy positions playing over the visuals of Baby Boomer Romney and Generation X'er Ryan appearing together in front of large crowds. In many ways, Ryan is an ""in-your-face"" choice, said Ron Bonjean, a Wisconsin native, GOP strategist and partner at the political communications firm Singer Bonjean Strategies. Ryan's selection forces the Obama campaign to pivot from attacks on Romney's tenure at private equity firm Bain Capital and refusal to release more tax returns and focus instead on debating solutions to shore up the ailing economy. Romney has campaigned largely on being critical of Obama's performance in office. However, this summer Romney has been hampered from expanding the conversation to the economy because he had to fend off the Obama campaign's questions about tax records and attacks on the former Massachusetts governor's private sector record. The days leading up to the Ryan announcement had shown that the attacks were having an effect: Obama appeared to be opening up a lead in most head-to-head polls. But even more troubling, Romney's unfavorable numbers were creeping up after weeks of attacks by the Obama campaign and those supporting it. Ryan's conservative stance extends beyond fiscal policy . ""The choice of Ryan allows the campaign to better paint a picture of exactly what the campaign believes in terms of fiscal responsibility,"" said Bonjean, who first became familiar with Ryan while working in congressional leadership offices. ""The Obama campaign started to define Romney and began to create a negative choice between the two campaigns. Picking Ryan hits the reset button for the campaign. It resets the campaign on policy terms. It takes away the politics of personal destruction that Obama was using and resets the campaign to talk about the two policy visions."" But there are pitfalls for the Republican ticket in picking Ryan. Ryan's controversial entitlement reform plan, ""Path to Prosperity""-- proposes a partially privatized Medicare program for future seniors. Instead of automatic enrollment in the government health care program for seniors, Ryan would give older Americans the option of buying into Medicare-approved plans with ""premium support"" payments or vouchers, as Democrats have described them. It is a proposal that Romney has not fully embraced, telling surrogates in a talking points memo obtained by CNN on Saturday: ""Gov. Romney applauds Paul Ryan for going in the right direction with his budget, and as president he will be putting together his own plan for cutting the deficit and putting the budget on a path to balance."" Obama was quick to pounce on Ryan as a veep choice. His selection makes the race a choice between two starkly different visions of the future in the country, the president said. ""My opponent and Congressman Ryan and their allies in Congress -- they all believe that if we just get rid of more regulations on big corporations and we give more tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, it will lead to jobs and prosperity for everybody else. That is what they are proposing,"" Obama said at a fundraiser in his hometown of Chicago on Sunday. ""That is where they will take us if they win. This is not speculation. It's on their websites and embodied in the budget that the House Republicans voted for repeatedly."" Obama campaign senior adviser David Axelrod said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that Ryan is a ""perfectly genial and bright guy,"" but at the same time a ""right-wing ideologue, and that is reflected in the positions that he's taken."" On Monday, Axelrod compared Romney's and Ryan's budget plans. ""For the middle class it feels like a choice between a punch in the nose and a knee to the groin,"" he told CBS. ""The fact is both plans call for trillions and trillions of dollars of new tax cuts skewed to the wealthy."" It's a refrain Democrats will try to hammer home in the weeks leading up to the Republican National Convention, said Christopher Arterton, a professor of political management at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management. ""The Democrats are trying to paint Ryan as an ardent conservative outside the mainstream of the U.S. in a way that they've not been able to make stick with Romney,"" Arterton said. ""This allows them to say 'When you buy Romney, you buy a whole party with a whole philosophy that brings us back to the economic crisis of 2008.' "" Obama's campaign and its surrogates jumped on Ryan's controversial plans for entitlement programs as written in the GOP budget plan that he authored. Republicans say the cuts are necessary to bring down debt, but Democrats say the cuts shift the burden of safety-net programs to the middle-class and the elderly. For all the energy and enthusiasm that Ryan brings to the ticket, those positions might make it harder for Romney because they could split the coalition that Republicans have made with blue-collar voters and the elderly, said Ron Brownstein, a CNN contributor and editorial director of National Journal. ""The modern GOP coalition is much more dependent than it used to be on both blue-collar and older voters,"" Brownstein said Monday on CNN's ""Starting Point."" While they don't like welfare, food stamps and other ""transfer programs,"" said Brownstein, ""they are much more supportive of middle-class entitlements."" Indeed, Obama's campaign posted a Web ad in Florida ahead of Romney's bus tour through that state on Monday -- without Ryan, who was campaigning on his own in Iowa -- pointing out what it says would be the costs to seniors if Medicare became the voucher program that Ryan advocates in his budget plan. For the next few weeks, both parties will battle over defining Ryan and what he stands for, Arterton said. A CNN/ORC International survey taken August 7-8, showed 54% of those polled saying they didn't know enough about Ryan to form an opinion . ""He is kind of the proverbial blank slate on which both sides are trying to write their message as the public try to figure out who he is,"" Arterton said. CNN's Jim Acosta, Peter Hamby, Athena Jones and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report .","Both sides got what they wanted in Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his running mate .
Conservatives celebrate Ryan's selection; choice helps shore up some support for Romney .

"Washington (CNN)  -- In case you didn't notice, London is on fire. Rioters are setting blazes, hurling stones, beating up famous statues and some of them kicked Prince Charles' car. Which is a little like beating up a statue, but still... Students have come unhinged over a plan to triple university fees. The government says it had to approve the increase to fight soaring budget problems. Americans are, of course, quite different from the Brits in many ways. But our young people certainly have this in common: Here, as there, tuition rates have steadily risen, job opportunities for graduates have grown more scarce, and the prospects of maintaining the ""good life"" so many younger folks enjoy now have dimmed. And history has shown time and again, that when young people get upset they have a nasty tendency to take it to the streets. Which has me wondering if maybe we're setting the stage for similar unrest here on the American side of the pond. We have a deficit problem. We're talking about hefty cuts of services and/or tax increases. And we always seem to have reasonable numbers of disaffected youth, no matter how many iPhones we buy for them. Now, I would never want to encourage wild civil disobedience. To the contrary, I was one of the first reporters on the streets for ABC News during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. I spent 50 straight hours in the fray amid smashing bottles, rampant looting, occasional gunshots and more major building fires than I could count. ""You need to get out of here, right now!"" a shop owner shouted at me shortly after the mob sacked his place. ""You're going to get killed."" More than 50 people were killed. Hundreds of others were hurt. It was fascinating, especially the guy I saw carrying a looted refrigerator from Sears entirely on his own, but it was also dangerous, destructive, and in the end, pointless. Note to potential rampagers: Wrecking your own neighborhood does little to improve the conditions that made you mad in the first place. That said, however, circumstances now appear favorable for some sort of similar outbreak of mob violence, given the right catalyst. First, unemployment is high. When people lose their paychecks, they get irritable. Combine the frustration of these folks with a job market that stubbornly refuses to give them any hope and you can see how fear of long-term joblessness can turn into anger -- at big business, at the government, at society in general. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows Los Angeles County had almost 11% unemployment in 1992. It hasn't been that high since. Um, except for now. Last year it smashed that ceiling and is now well over 12%. Second, political and cultural divisions are deep and deepening. I have a caveat to add here. My travels and a variety of polls have suggested that regular voters are substantially more interested in cooperation, compromise and moderation than the hard core partisans who dominate Washington politics. But the parties, as the current Bush tax cuts fight shows, are still often more compelled by the idea of making their opponents lose than in helping the whole nation win. Compromise is what keeps fights from happening in most of America. In D.C. it is a dirty word. And again, we can look to Europe to see parallels. They, too, have watched the gulf widen between opposing political parties as the economy has strained each ruling majority to find quick solutions or pay the price at the polls. Third, the hard times are far from over. Even as the nation emerges (we hope) from the recession, all the warning signs say high unemployment, low housing values, rising taxes and much lower limits on what government can afford may well be the new normal. And one more time, the similarities hold true. Europe has a long slog ahead of it too, with likely many more privations that will profoundly affect the plans and ambitions of the young. None of this means that rioting is inevitable. As I mentioned above, there would have to be a catalyst, some event or decision that spurred all that potential angry energy into action. Figuring out what the catalyst might be requires less scientist than psychic. But remember the health care town hall meetings? No one initially expected them to be as explosive as they were, and yet several bordered on getting out of control. There is also this: Every society has some folks in it who are really just aching for a good riot. One of the best reads about riots is Bill Buford's book, ""Among the Thugs."" Buford spent time with English soccer hooligans trying to understand what drove them to tear cities apart when their teams lost, or won, or tied, or just showed up at the stadium. Part of what he found is that soccer had little to do with it. The hooligans used their rioting as a steam valve, a way to crash against the barriers of social limits, express their fury over their lot in life and generally spice up otherwise boring weekends. Ultimately, they fought because they liked fighting. What might keep us from having riots? Well, there is inertia. Getting people motivated enough to storm the Bastille is not as easy as it looks, and despite our troubles we are still a wealthy society. When you have enough entertainment and life is not completely unbearable, it's hard to persuade the crowd to gather pitchforks. But the question ""Why do riots start?"" remains largely an enigma, despite many efforts to produce an answer. We may be able to trace any given riot back to its roots, but that information doesn't seem to help us much in preventing the next one. I don't know if we are headed for riots now. I hope not, because I have seen how terrible they can be. But my experience tells me that the conditions, like dry woods in a season of lightning, are favorable for a fire. And once it starts, putting it out can prove costly and difficult. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Foreman.","Tom Foreman wonders if U.S. might have unrest similar to Britain's .

"Rome (CNN) -- A group representing survivors of sexual abuse by priests named a ""Dirty Dozen"" list of cardinals it said would be the worst candidates for pope based on their handling of child sex abuse claims or their public comments about the cases. The list names three U.S. Roman Catholic cardinals and nine from other countries. Watch for the smoke: How is a new pope elected? SNAP, the Survivors' Network of those Abused by Priests, said as it released the list Wednesday that its accusations were based on media reports, legal filings and victims' statements. A representative for one of the cardinals on list dismissed the group. The remaining cardinals or their representatives couldn't be immediately reached by CNN for comment Wednesday. ""I'm not going to respond to this group which has little to no credibility,"" said Joseph Zwelling, a spokesman for Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York. When asked about the SNAP list, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, told CNN: ""We believe it is not up to SNAP to decide who comes to conclave and who is chosen. ... cardinals can decide themselves without asking SNAP for advice."" Lombardi and another Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Thomas Rosica, read the SNAP press release together, Rosica said. Lombardi declined to comment further. The two other U.S. cardinals on the list are Sean O'Malley of Boston and Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C., the group said. A spokeswoman for Wuerl declined to comment. The others listed are Leonardo Sandri of Argentina, George Pell of Australia, Marc Ouellet of Canada, Dominik Duka or the Czech Republic, Peter Turkson of Ghana, Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras, Tarcisio Bertone and Angelo Scola of Italy, and Norberto Rivera Carrera of Mexico, the group said. Not all of them are linked to alleged coverups of sexual abuse, SNAP said. Some were placed on the list because of their public remarks related to the abuse scandal, SNAP said. On Monday, SNAP also called for some of the older cardinals to remove themselves from the meetings held before the election of the new pope, arguing that some have been accused of complicity in protecting priests accused of sexually abusing children. Cardinals from around the globe have been summoned to Rome to take part in the process of choosing the next pontiff, after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI last week. As of midday, 113 of the 115 cardinals eligible to elect the new pope are in Rome, according to Lombardi. To be eligible to be a part of the group, a cardinal must be under the age of 80. The two cardinal-electors who are not yet there are Kazimierz Nycz of Warsaw, who was due to arrive later Wednesday, and Jean-Baptiste Pham Minh Man of Vietnam, who is arriving Thursday. Interactive: A look at possible papal contenders . No date has yet been proposed for the secret election, or conclave, to select the former pontiff's successor. Meanwhile, a new study says American Catholics view sex abuse by clergy as the most important problem facing the church today, according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. When asked to put in their own words what's the most pressing issue facing their church, 34% of the U.S. Catholics questioned cite pedophilia, sex abuse or another phrase for the same problem, Pew said. No other problem received a more than 10% response; the next biggest issue named is low trust and low credibility, at 9%, Pew said. 'Silence didn't work' SNAP is intentionally focusing on candidates with a realistic chance of being named pope, its executive director David Clohessy said Wednesday as the group released its list. ""The single quickest and most effective step would be for the next pope to clearly discipline, demote, denounce and even defrock cardinals and bishops who are concealing child sex crimes. We think that's the missing piece,"" he said. The new pope should order each bishop around the world to hand over ""every piece of paper he has on proven, admitted or credibly accused child-molesting clerics to law enforcement,"" Clohessy said. Barbara Dorris, victims' outreach director for SNAP, said: ""The short answer is we've tried silence, silence didn't work, so we have to speak out. We have to do everything we can to get this information out there."" The Catholic Church has been rocked by a series of child sex abuse scandals in recent years -- and the new pope will be under pressure to deal more effectively with a crisis that has shaken public confidence in the church. SNAP says it's vital to look at how the world's bishops have handled claims of abuse by priests because the crisis is far from over. ""This scandal, we believe, has yet to surface in most nations. It's shameless spin and deliberate deception to claim otherwise. It's tempting to reassure the public and the parishioners by making this claim. But it's also irresponsible,"" a statement on SNAP's website said. ""Clergy sex crimes and coverups remain deeply hidden in the vast majority of nations (where most Catholics live), and has really only become widely known -- and barely addressed -- in the U.S. about a decade ago and in a few European countries even more recently."" What's in a name? Clues to be found in next pope's moniker . Media leaks concern . A news conference scheduled by American cardinals for Wednesday, following media briefings on Monday and Tuesday, was canceled at short notice. Asked if the Vatican had told the American cardinals to stop their daily media briefings, Vatican spokesman Rosica suggested that the details of what was discussed in the general congregations were not meant to be publicized. ""It's not up to Father Lombardi or myself to tell them what to do,"" he said. ""It could be that among themselves they realized that there are different ways and different methods of getting things out."" Sister Mary Ann Walsh, director of media relations for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said via e-mail that the U.S. cardinals were committed to transparency and had wanted to share ""a process-related overview of their work"" with the public ""in order to inform while ensuring the confidentiality"" of the general congregations. ""Due to concerns over accounts being reported in the Italian press, which breached confidentiality, the College of Cardinals has agreed not to give interviews,"" she said. In total, 153 cardinals gathered Wednesday at the Vatican for a third day of meetings, known as general congregations, before they set the timetable for the election. The cardinals spoke about new evangelization, restructuring of the church hierarchy, or curia, and the need for good governance of the church, Lombardi said. A five-minute limit has been imposed on cardinals speaking at the meetings, although the microphone is not being switched off if they run over the time allowed. The cardinals have decided to meet twice Thursday, in the morning and afternoon, in order to ""intensify the rhythm of work,"" Lombardi said. Video shown at a Vatican news conference showed workers preparing the Sistine Chapel for the secretive conclave. An elevated floor is being put in place to protect the elaborate mosaic tiling, said Lombardi, where seats will be placed for the cardinals. The Sistine Chapel and its ornate ceiling by Michelangelo are normally a must-see for tourists in Rome, but it was closed to the public beginning Tuesday afternoon to allow for preparations to take place. CNN's Richard Allen Greene and Hada Messia reported from Rome, and Laura Smith-Spark reported and wrote in London.

"(CNN) -- An Olympic gold medal is no guarantee of subsequent success as a professional boxer, but it meant the world for Wladimir Klitschko. However, that did not stop the Ukrainian from selling the coveted super heavyweight prize he won 16 years ago at the Atlanta Games. ""It was absolutely a highlight in my life and also a highlight for the country because Ukraine in 1996 for the first time traveled to the Olympic Games as an independent country,"" the 36-year-old told CNN. ""We collected a lot of medals and we got ninth place worldwide, so we got in the top 10, which was a great achievement by the athletes."" Klitschko will attend Friday's glittering opening ceremony for London 2012 as the holder of four of the five recognized heavyweight belts. Unlike his Olympic successor, Britain's Sydney 2000 champion Audley Harrison, he has a formidable record in professional boxing, winning 58 of his 61 fights -- 51 by knockout. Video: Amir Khan's boxing master class . He and his brother Vitali -- who holds the heavyweight division's other title, the WBC belt -- have dominated the elite class for the last five years. But it was one of their many interests outside the ring that convinced Wladimir to auction off his gold medal -- so the proceeds could boost the coffers of the charitable foundation they set up the same year he fought his way to Olympic glory. ""I did sell the medal in March and 100% of the funds, which is $1 million, went to the Klitschko Brothers Foundation -- we care about education and sport, that is the key in any children's life,"" Wladimir said. ""If they have knowledge they can succeed with that in their adult life and sport gives them the rules -- how to respect your opponent, how to respect the rules. ""It is always in life like that, you go down but you have to get up, and sport gives you this great lesson."" Haye vs. Chisora? That's just handbags - watch the women at the Olympics . Klitschko's most recent defense of his quartet of titles came against American Tony Thompson in Switzerland two weeks ago, when the Ukrainian stopped his 40-year-old opponent in the sixth round. And though he has penciled in another fight before the end of this year, Klitschko has yet to secure an opponent. ""I'm a seasoned fighter and that means I have to stay busy, so I fought twice this year and by the end of the year -- November, December -- I'm going to defend my titles again,"" he said. ""I don't know who is going to be the next opponent because I just fought recently."" One of Klitschko's most recent victories came against former heavyweight champion David Haye in Hamburg last year, and though the Briton retired after the fight he recently returned to the ring to beat compatriot Dereck Chisora. Haye has repeatedly said he wants to fight Vitali, but Wladimir wouldn't be drawn on whether the pair would finally square off in the ring, saying his brother's political ambitions would be his main focus after his bout against Manuel Charr. ""It's very difficult to follow the wishes of David Haye -- he's going to fight Vitali then he's not, he's retired then he's not,"" Klitschko said. ""There is a lot of controversy back and forth, and to make it clear Vitali is going to defend his WBC title in Moscow on September 8 against Manuel Charr and we can't look beyond that. ""First of all he has to win the fight, then he's going to have parliamentary elections because Vitali is a politician. ""He's hopefully going to get enough percentage and pass the line to get to the parliament of Ukraine, so then we'll see how it goes with David Haye and the fight.""","Wladimir Klitschko tells CNN his gold at the Atlanta Olympics is one of his career highlights .

"(CNN) -- Ahmed Fouad Negm, Egypt's ""poet of the people"" whose biting political verses inspired rebellion and taunted successive regimes for decades, died Tuesday in Cairo at age 84. Negm's colloquial prose made poetry an act of defiance directly accessible to millions of poor and illiterate laborers often marginalized by the palace-based Cairo government. ""Who are we and who are they? They are the princes and sultans and we are the poor convicts. Solve this riddle and use your brain: See which of us rules over the other? Which of us serves the other?"" reads one of Negm's most popular poems. Born to an impoverished family of ""fellahin,"" or peasants, Negm published countless love poems for his maiden, the nation of Egypt, and once said: ""The love for a woman exists in the body. It is temporary and passes. But the love for a cause lives in your mind and in your blood forever."" Negm shot to fame in the 1970s when he began a more than 30-year partnership with a blind oud player known as Sheikh Imam who sang his witty criticism to the music of the pear-shaped, stringed instrument. ""A great renaissance will take place. And we will finally be worth something ... And we will never need Syria or Libya again. And an Arab Union will finally be formed with London and the Vatican. The poor will eat sweet potato. And walk around all cocky,"" Sheik Imam sings softly with a smirk as the chorus responds with the French refrain ""wee wee."" The sharp-tounged satirist never shied away from controversy, which earned him a total of 18 years in prison and made him a timeless icon of resistance whose words galvanized protesters from Egypt's 1977 bread riots to the 2011 revolution. ""Prohibited from travel, prohibited from singing, prohibited from words, prohibited from longing...everyday your love brings more prohibition and every day I love you more than the day that passed,"" Negm wrote mockingly after the government of then-President Gamal Abdel Nasser imposed measures to limit his influence and reach. The leather-faced poet, famous for wearing the galbya, the long robes worn by Egypt's common man, often riddled verses with crude insults and funny anecdotes that endeared him to Egypt's coffee house audience but made him plenty of enemies among the ruling class. ""Regarding the issue of beans and meat an alleged official source decreed ... eating Egyptian beans makes you strong as an ox ... and Dr. Mohsin added that meat is surely poison. It cause stomach pains and turns you into a thief,"" Negm wrote mocking the failure of the state to provide for its growing numbers of hungry and underprivileged citizens. Affectionately nicknamed Al Fagoumi, Negm won dozens of awards but choose to imitate his art with a humble life in a ramshackle Cairo apartment where he hosted literary circles and continued to feed Egypt's revolutionary fervor with recent works like the ""Brave Man is Brave,"" which became a staple slogan in the iconic Tahrir Square. ""Ahmed Fouad Negm is honoured for creating true poetry in vernacular Arabic that communicates deeply with people; for his independence, unwavering integrity, courage and rigorous commitment to the struggle for freedom and justice; for speaking truth to power, refusing to be silenced and inspiring more than three generations in the Arab-speaking world,"" said statement by The Prince Claus Fund, which named Negm as its Principal Laureate for 2013. A rebel to the end, Negm supported the 2011 Egyptian revolution and the ouster of Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Morsy earlier this year. When asked what he would write about Egypt's new strongman, General Abdel Fatah El Sisi, Negm said: ""This man Sisi is sharper than the devil himself. After all is he not a peasant?""","Peasant-born poet Ahmed Fouad Negm challenged Egyptian elites .

"(CNN) -- Apparent problems with an online calculator, released last week along with new cholesterol guidelines, prompted one expert Monday to suggest implementation of the guidelines be postponed. The risk calculator, meant to assist doctors in evaluating patients' risk and treatment options for cholesterol, appears to greatly overstate risk, according to a report Sunday in The New York Times. It could result in millions of people being incorrectly identified as candidates for cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, the report said. The calculator, released by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, is a tool to evaluate a patient's 10-year risk of a heart attack. According to the new guidelines, if a person's risk is above 7.5%, he or she should be put on a statin. Not on cholesterol meds? New guidelines could change that . However, in a hastily called telebriefing Monday morning, members of the committee who developed the calculator and guidelines said that they knew about the risk of overestimation before rolling out the assessment tool and that they welcome more information to help refine it. The tool, they said, is only one part of evaluating patients' treatment options -- something that can only be done with the help of a doctor. No one should be ""mailed a prescription"" based on the results of the assessment tool, said Dr. Neil Stone, committee chairman. ""There's got to be a physician-patient discussion. ... We've put the physician back into crucial decision-making."" However, ""I can't speak to whether the calculator is valid or not,"" Dr. Robert Eckel, co-chair of the American Heart Association committee that wrote the new guidelines and the association's past president, told CNN. ""That needs to be determined. ""We trusted that the calculator worked,"" he said. ""We trusted that the calculator is valid."" Concerns about the calculator were first raised, according to the Times report, by Harvard Medical School professors Paul Ridker and Nancy Cook. In an analysis to be published Tuesday in the medical journal The Lancet, a copy of which was obtained by CNN Ridker and Cook write they calculated 10-year risks using the tool and compared the data to event rates using three large previously-published studies in which participants' characteristics such as age and smoking status were known. The calculator ""systematically overestimated observed risks by 75 to 150 percent, roughly doubling the actual observed risk,"" they wrote. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen said when she used the calculator, putting in a 65-year-old man with normal cholesterol levels and no risk factors -- normal blood pressure, no diabetes and a nonsmoker -- the calculator said he needed statins. Ridker and Cook had pointed out the issue a year earlier when drafts were sent to them for review as the guidelines were under development, the Times said. Researchers apparently did not receive the professors' responses, Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, chairman of the committee that developed the equation, told the Times. 5 ways to lower your cholesterol . But Lloyd-Jones told reporters Monday, ""There's nothing wrong with these equations."" Committee members were aware there could be ""overestimation of risk in some populations,"" he said. On Saturday night, members of the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology held a meeting with Ridker. Officials said Monday they await more information from the professor. Lloyd-Jones said Monday he looks forward to getting details of Ridker's data. But he said, ""I suspect he's looking at extremely healthy cohorts. We're looking at representative cohorts."" The truth, he predicted, is ""somewhere in the middle."" ""Our risk assessment guideline doesn't tell you what to do. ... It just evaluates risk,"" he said. ""The analysis by Drs. Ridker and Cook is very concerning,"" said Dr. Steven Nissen, chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. ""Since the risk calculator was not previously published, it now makes sense to halt implementation of the guidelines so that independent physician scientists can evaluate the accuracy of the risk calculator,"" Nissen told CNN in an e-mail. ""We have waited many years for these guidelines. It seems prudent to wait a little longer to make certain that the guidelines function as intended."" Attempts by CNN to contact Ridker and Cook on Monday were not immediately successful. The new treatment guidelines call for a focus on risk factors rather than just a patient's cholesterol level. At the time, Nissen called them ""an enormous shift in policy as it relates to who should be treated for high levels of cholesterol."" The four questions to ask to determine risk include: Do you have heart disease? Do you have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes? Do you have a bad cholesterol level of more than 190? And is your 10-year risk of a heart attack greater than 7.5%? According to the new guidelines, if you can answer yes to any of those four questions, you should be on a statin. Do you need to take statins? CNN's Miriam Falco and John Bonifield contributed to this report.","A calculator reportedly overstates heart attack risk .

"(CNN) -- Variable wind, thunderstorms and the loss of 35 helium-filled balloons within a few hours of liftoff put an end to the flight of two lawn-chair-seated adventurers who never got out of Oregon. Kent Couch and Fareed Lafta, who had hoped to reach northwest Montana by Sunday, landed late Saturday afternoon southeast of Prineville, Oregon, team officials said. iReport: Watch the balloon adventure lift off . The men were disappointed but not injured, flight spokesman Mark Knowles told CNN. ""They're a little rattled,"" said Knowles. ""We are glad that they are safe. Kent is very disappointed they did not get what he set out for."" Couch and Lafta, seated side-by-side in a specially built rig, went aloft at Couch's service station in Bend, Oregon. But within a few hours, about 35 of the large 350 helium-filled balloons had burst, said Knowles. That compared to the loss of six balloons lost in a previous Couch flight to Idaho. Couch and Lafta, an Iraqi, released water stored in four containers as ballast so they could adjust their altitude, said Lance Schliep, a member of the chase crew. At about 11,000 feet, the craft struggled to reach higher elevations, where it could catch air currents that would push it toward its destination, said Schliep. That never happened. The pair circled for three hours near Prineville, about 35 miles northeast of Bend. ""Unless the wind starts taking them somewhere at this point they won't break distance records,"" Schliep told CNN before the decision to land. The weather then became a larger factor as thunderstorms moved in. ""Fareed said it was hailing and snowing on them,"" said Schliep. ""They got real concerned about that. They wanted to get down."" After attempting a first landing, the balloonists brought their craft down in a farmer's field. Schliep, who operates an appliance service in Bend, helped Couch construct the rig. ""We would put it together, keep making changes and take it apart,"" he said. ""It was very exciting and fun to do. It's just disappointing at this stage."" The flyers used balloons and the release of water to control their flight. ""The only way you can steer it is to get up or down to get in different air currents,"" according to Schliep. After the rough landing Saturday, the rig took off again, sans adventurers. Knowles described the surreal sight while talking with CNN. ""It's sitting at about 4,000 (feet) and not going anywhere,"" he said. According to the team's website, Lafta and Couch plan to launch a cluster balloon craft to raise awareness of the plight of Iraqi orphans later this year. Knowles said he did not know the status of the Baghdad flight.","Two flyers are ""rattled"" but unharmed .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's information minister escaped an assassination attempt unharmed Tuesday, his office manager said. The minister, Ali al-Amrani, was headed to the prime minister's office when the attack occurred, spokesman Abdul Basit al-Qaedi told CNN. At least 10 bullets were shot in the direction of the vehicle al-Amrani was getting into, al-Qaedi said. Three bullets hit the back window and trunk of the car, he added. Witnesses said there were at least two gunmen. Al-Amrani was not hurt in the attack, al-Qaedi said. The minister's office said al-Amrani has been targeted recently in a hate campaign by pro-revolution groups. ""A number of factions in the country started a hate campaign against the minister and threats were given to him in the past,"" said al-Qaedi. Yemen's Interior Ministry told CNN the attack is under investigation, but there are no prime suspects. Last week, al-Amrani received a death threat by an anonymous caller from a Saudi telephone number, al-Qaedi said. The minister recently launched a massive presidential campaign to support candidate Abdurabu Hadi, the country's current vice president. Al-Amrani told CNN the country is facing a critical time for change and all Yemenis must stand together to support Hadi. Yemen has been beset with demonstrations against President Ali Abdullah Saleh since early last year, when pro-democratic uprisings spread across the Arab world. Demonstrators have continued their protests against the president, despite a power transfer deal that leads to his departure. Under the plan, Saleh -- who's been in office for 33 years -- will step down after the February 21 elections and will receive immunity under the plan forged by the Gulf Cooperation Council. Executive powers have already been transferred to Hadi.","The minister has been the target of a hate campaign, his aide says .

"(CNN) -- Ask friends whether they remember the IKEA monkey, and a few may nod tentatively. The backstory: On a chilly December day in 2012, a small monkey dressed in a faux shearling coat and diaper appeared inside the doors of a Toronto IKEA store. The animal appeared frantic, racing around the parking lot and near the store. It created quite a stir. Photos soon appeared on social media, with memes not far behind. A parody Twitter account quickly gained thousands of followers. The story that emerged left the monkey's caregiver, a real-estate lawyer named Yasmin Nakhuda, in a tough spot. She had reportedly obtained the Japanese snow macaque, named Darwin, illegally when he was just over a month old. Videos on her YouTube channel provided glimpses of the next seven months, in which she described how often he ate and how much attention he required. But after Darwin's public escape and appearance, she was fined and forced to hand Darwin over to animal services. Animal services quickly turned him over to the Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary. Nakhuda vowed to get Darwin back and filed a lawsuit against the sanctuary. On Friday, a judge ruled against Nakhuda. CBC News reported the judge rejected her argument that Toronto animal services staff duped her and acted illegally by seizing Darwin. The judge also ruled that Nakhuda purchased Darwin knowing that it was illegal and lied by later saying the animal was a gift, CBC News reported. Bronwyn Iler Page became Internet famous when she was first to tweet about Darwin: ""Umm saw a monkey in the ikea parking lot,"" alongside a photo of the wistful-looking monkey in his tiny coat. She still has posted on her Twitter bio, ""I saw the monkey #Ikeamonkey."" Judging from her newsfeed, Page continues to post about monkeys whenever the opportunity arises. Attorney Kevin D. Toyne said sanctuary volunteers are very happy and relieved with the decision. Toyne said Darwin is making good progress, becoming a young adult macaque instead of a small child.","Darwin the snow macaque wandered into an IKEA store in December .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Surfers beware. There is an incredibly influential and vocal group on Twitter, using a common hashtag and blazing keyboards to ensure their African country is discussed fairly and with respect online. Kenyans on Twitter, better known as #KOT, are a 21st century phenomenon born out of the social media boom and growing economy in East Africa's most populous city, Nairobi. Why are they so vocal and what is it doing for the country at large? My mission for ""Inside Africa"" recently was to find out - and I did so with an experiment. The concept was simple; if Kenyans are so connected I should be able to assemble a quick meet-up; I should be able to navigate Nairobi via Twitter. The entire process should teach me how tech-savvy this country really is and show me where its heading. It worked far better than expected. Technically speaking, Kenyans are special, as they are members of an exclusive and enviable club. The country is among the top four users of the web in all of Africa, behind only Egypt, Morocco and Nigeria. What's more impressive is the connection speed at which they surf. The Kenyan government recently installed broadband infrastructure, which behind Ghana, is the second fastest on the continent. Read more: African tech voices to follow on Twitter . Also, the Kenyan Government, in coordination with the World Bank, has embarked on a multi-million dollar initiative to use information and communications technology -- or ICT -- to accelerate economic growth and promote transparency. For these reasons and more, the response to my call for a random meeting was met with enthusiasm. One by one, half a dozen #KOTs approached me in the predetermined cafe (offering free wi-fi) shouting the password, ""connected!"" Each told me how the internet is making their lives easier from paying bills through a mobile money service called Mpesa or sending out links to their resumes via social media. What's more fascinating is the place they all suggested I visit, iHub. Essentially it's a nexus of innovation with free-flowing ideas meant to serve as an incubator for future Kenyan-grown advancements. Via Twitter, users gave me advice on how to get there and who to meet. I met the manager Tosh Juma standing amid what appeared to be a college study hall. He introduced me to software developers, web designers and tech enthusiasts all at different stages of their ICT projects. Of course there was the obligatory coffee bar, foosball table and comfy gaming seats on the floor -- but there was also a real sense of responsibility for the future and well-being of the country. Read more: How mobile broadband can transform Africa . One young entrepreneur is Susan Eve Oguya, eagerly telling me about her SMS or text service for Kenyan farmers, MFarm. It allows them to check up-to-the-minute market rates for their goods so devious middlemen can't deceive them. She tells me its especially important for her since she comes from a family of people who make their living on farms. Another developer, Nevi Mukherjee showed me a tablet-based application designed for Kenya's school children called eLimu. It brings the country's academic curriculum to life with pictures, video and interactive quizzes. It's no wonder Google plucked many of iHub's members, like Ory Okolloh of the crisis-mapping site Ushahidi, to join their African ranks. My final stop on this online experiment was Google's offices in Kenya.

From Joe's corner office overlooking Nairobi he tells me of his wish for his young children, ""I think they are going to have a much easier life and hopefully... compete globally even more. They don't have the same hang ups we had, that 'we're behind'. They think they deserve everything and should be doing everything -- that's the right attitude for young people now."" Kenya online usage has grown exponentially. Back in the year 2000 only 200,000 were logged onto the web, at the end of 2011, that number was around 10.5 million. No one knows how many internet users - or #KOTs for that matter - there will be in 2021 but one thing is for sure; there will be many and they will be helping Kenya stand out proudly in an increasingly crowded online universe.","Twitter users in Kenya are using common hashtag #KOT to talk about their country online .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush lifted an executive order banning offshore oil drilling on Monday and urged Congress to follow suit. If President Bush can persuade Congress, more oil rigs like this one off Canada could appear off U.S. shores. Citing the high prices Americans are paying at the pump, Bush said from the White House Rose Garden that allowing offshore oil drilling is ""one of the most important steps we can take"" to reduce that burden. However, the move is largely symbolic as there is also a federal law banning offshore drilling. ""This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress,"" Bush said.  Watch Bush announce lifting of ban » . Bush has been pushing Congress to repeal the law passed in 1981. ""There is no excuse for delay,"" the president said in a Rose Garden statement last month. iReport.com: Is drilling the answer? ""In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil, and that means we need to increase supply here at home,"" Bush said, adding that there is no more pressing issue for many Americans than gas prices. Bush's father, President George H.W. Bush, signed the executive order in 1990 banning offshore drilling.  See where offshore drilling is allowed » . The issue has gained prominence in the presidential race. Sen. John McCain recently announced he supported offshore oil drilling, reversing his previous stance. Sen. Barack Obama wants to keep the ban in place. Experts say offshore oil drilling would not have an immediate impact on oil prices because oil exploration takes years. ""If we were to drill today, realistically speaking, we should not expect a barrel of oil coming out of this new resource for three years, maybe even five years, so let's not kid ourselves,"" said Fadel Gheit, oil and gas analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. Equity Capital Markets Division. But it almost certainly would be profitable. Candida Scott, an oil industry researcher at Cambridge Research Associates, said oil needs to be priced at $60 a barrel or more to justify deep-shelf drilling. With oil now selling for $145 a barrel, companies are almost assured of profiting from offshore drilling, Scott said. In his statement last month, Bush also renewed his demand that Congress allow drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, clear the way for more refineries and encourage efforts to recover oil from shale in areas such as the Green River Basin of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. The White House estimates that there are 18 billion barrels of oil offshore that have not been exploited because of state bans, 10 billion to 12 billion in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the Green River Basin.","End to executive ban on offshore drilling does not affect separate federal law .

"(CNN) -- Who walks away from $10 million? Who creates something beloved and beautiful that will eventually earn him well in excess of $10 million, and says he doesn't want the money? The answer is a story of generosity and grace that seems fitting for this season of giving. I was doing some research on the great songwriter Irving Berlin, who, with his family, fled oppression in Russia when he was 5 years old and came to the United States. He knew no English; he grew up in poverty on New York's Lower East Side. He taught himself music. He wrote the lyrics and melodies to more than 1,500 songs, including some of the most popular in history: ""White Christmas,"" ""Easter Parade,"" ""Alexander's Ragtime Band,"" ""This Is the Army, Mr. Jones,"" ""Cheek to Cheek."" His feel for the sound of words was close to perfect; if you want to learn the craft of writing, not only music, but any kind of effective writing, study the lyrics -- the precision, the economy, the playfulness, the respect for language and cadence -- of Berlin's ""There's No Business Like Show Business."" There is not a wasted syllable. Because ""White Christmas"" -- the cherished holiday song written by the Jewish immigrant -- will, as usual, be played and sung often this month, I was trying to find out all I could about Berlin's life and career. And came upon an astonishing, profoundly moving act of altruism. It has to do with the song he considered the most important he ever wrote -- the song that meant the most to him. In 1938, the vocalist Kate Smith was looking for a song to sing on her coast-to-coast CBS radio program to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Armistice Day. She asked Berlin if he would write something for her. He remembered a song he had begun years before, and had discarded. He brought it out and went back to work on it. Thus it was that, on the CBS radio network one November night, Kate Smith delivered the first public performance of Irving Berlin's ""God Bless America."" The acclaim was immediate and electrifying. The world was on the verge of a terrible new war; all over the United States, people heard Berlin's song and took it to their hearts. He understood what a valuable property he had on his hands. And he quietly made a firm decision: . He never wanted to make a penny from it. He wanted whatever success the song had to be his gift to the nation he adored. ""He believed that the United States had rescued his life,"" Laurence Bergreen, author of the Berlin biography ""As Thousands Cheer,"" told me. ""This was his genuine patriotic gesture. He had a real soft spot for America, and this is how he expressed it."" Berlin instructed attorneys to draw up papers. He wanted to guarantee that every cent ""God Bless America"" ever earned went to a place that he thought would help to make the country's future brighter and stronger. In those months leading up to the U.S. entry into World War II, he selected the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts to receive the song's earnings -- specifically, he wanted the royalties to go to Boy Scout and Girl Scout programs in impoverished and disadvantaged areas. His binding legal instructions are in effect to this day, 73 years after ""God Bless America"" was first sung by Kate Smith and 22 years after Berlin's death. So far, there has been more than $10 million distributed to Scouting programs, and it's still coming in. ""Irving Berlin and his heirs have never collected a penny,"" said Bert Fink, an executive in the office that administers the earnings from Berlin's songs. ""He was always a staunch protector of his copyrights,"" said musicologist Sheryl Kaskowitz, who wrote her Harvard University Ph.D. dissertation on the song, and who is working on a book about it for Oxford University Press. ""For him to do this with 'God Bless America' was his sincere thank you to the country."" Trustees of the fund Berlin set up are free to allocate the money to programs where they feel it will be beneficial. It has gone to different Scouting organizations over the years. The current recipients of the royalties are the Greater New York Councils of the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. Officials for both groups told me it is impossible to overestimate how much good the ""God Bless America"" royalties continue to do for boys and girls with few advantages or resources; there are Scouting programs in homeless shelters and public housing projects that would not exist were it not for the fund. The popularity of the song has seen ebbs and flows over the years. The country seems to find it anew when it is needed. On September 11, 2001, after the attacks, members of Congress stood together, Republicans and Democrats shoulder-to-shoulder, on the steps of the Capitol and, seemingly spontaneously, joined in singing ""God Bless America."" That signaled a renaissance for the song; it is now regularly heard at sporting events and public gatherings. In the final years of Berlin's life, he grew reclusive. He had not had a hit song in decades. Rock music and performances by singer-songwriters had replaced the kind of music he had mastered. But even toward the end, he found comfort in knowing how many young people the royalties from ""God Bless America"" were helping. His belief was simple: Everyone, regardless of background or beginnings, should be given a chance to shine. After all, look what happened to him. He died in 1989. The money will continue to go to Scout organizations as long as ""God Bless America"" is sung and played -- which is to say, as long as there is a United States of America. Who walks away from $10 million? Irving Berlin did. Happily and proudly. Why? The answer is as clear and direct as the second line in that song of his: . "". . .land that I love. . . .""

"(CNN) -- A blond girl found in Greece whose birth parents were traced to a Bulgarian Roma village will be cared for by a foster family when she's returned to Bulgaria, the government's social services agency said . Maria, as the girl was known by the Roma couple with whom she was living in central Greece, was at the center of an international mystery after police discovered her. DNA tests eventually showed that Saska Ruseva and her husband, Atanas Rusev, were her biological parents. Her mother told CNN that she wants her child back -- but that seems unlikely to happen for now. Maria, now being cared for by Greek children's charity Smile of a Child, will instead be cared for by a foster family. The parents and their nine children have been living in poverty in a tumbledown, one-room mud brick house in the village of Nikolaevo, in central Bulgaria. Emil Todorov, director of the Children Protection Department of Bulgaria's Agency for Social Assistance, told CNN it was not yet clear what documents Maria would arrive with. Bulgaria's State Child Protection Agency has yet to say exactly when and how the girl will be brought from Greece, he said. Her interactions with her birth family will be determined by who is named as her legal guardian, he said. The Agency for Social Assistance is also taking action to care for the Bulgarian parents' seven underage children. The two youngest, ages 2 and 3, will stay with one foster family, said Todorov. Two other children will stay with another foster family, and a 15-year-old will stay with family members. The remaining two, ages 8 and 12, will be staying at a specialized institution, because no appropriate foster families are available to take them in, he said. Working with the parents . The placement of the children in foster care is only a temporary stage, Todorov said. The goal is to give the parents the chance to improve their living conditions -- in which case they can be reunited with their children. Social services will help the parents find a job, he said. ""We have to work with both parents, so that they can expand their parental potential,"" said Todorov. While the children are in foster care, social workers will encourage frequent meetings with their parents, so that the family maintains its emotional connection, he said. ""We don't take away the children,"" he said. ""We count on the collaboration by the whole family to cope with this difficult situation."" The Agency for Social Assistance said it had determined the parents had another child too, who was ""abandoned by her parents and raised by a family in another city."" Bulgarian police are investigating the Rusevs on suspicion they sold Maria for illegal adoption. A Greek Roma couple -- Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulo -- who were found looking after the girl are in custody, charged with kidnapping. Daughter given away, says mother . Ruseva told CNN that she and her husband left for Greece in 2009 to look for farm work. She says she left her eldest daughter Katia, now 20 years old, to care for the family while they were away. Ruseva says she was so thin she did not realize she was pregnant with Maria. ""I didn't know I was pregnant. I didn't even have a belly,"" she said. Maria -- whom Ruseva originally named Stanka -- was born in a hospital in the Greek town of Lamia, about 70 kilometers (44 miles) from Farsala and the Roma camp where she was discovered this month. Ruseva said she cared for Maria for seven months while her husband worked in poorly paying odd jobs, picking fruit and vegetables. They often slept in the streets or nearby olive groves, as they had so little money. Then one day, when they took a job picking oranges, a woman offered to take care of their daughter and they gave her to the woman because they couldn't care for her themselves, Ruseva said. She denies selling the baby, saying she loves her and wants her back. CNN's Karl Penhaul contributed to this report.","NEW: Social workers will try to help parents improve living conditions so children can return .

"(CNN) -- American intelligence-leaker Edward Snowden applied for temporary asylum in Russia on Tuesday, a move that might soon allow him to leave Moscow's international airport while the request is considered, a Russian lawyer who helped him with the request told CNN. If the request is granted, Snowden would be able to live in Russia -- and even travel abroad -- for at least a year, lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said. And, despite previous indications that Snowden eventually wanted refuge in Latin America, Kucherena indicated Tuesday that Snowden might take his time in Russia. ""As far as I know, he's planning to stay in Russia to learn Russian culture, Russian language and (to) live here,"" Kucherena said. Kucherena told the state-run RIA Novosti news agency that Snowden ""intends to stay in Russia for now."" ""I asked him (what his plans were), he doesn't plan to go anywhere just yet,"" Kucherena said, according to RIA Novosti. This is the latest in a series of steps that Snowden has made in an attempt to establish a life outside the United States, where he faces espionage charges after publicly admitting that he released documents to the media that exposed U.S. mass surveillance programs. Kucherena said Snowden wrote the asylum request Tuesday at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, where he has been holed up for the past three weeks because the United States revoked his passport. Russia's Federal Migration Service could take up to three months to consider Snowden's request, said Kucherena, a lawyer with a Kremlin advisory body. Interactive map: Snowden's movements and asylum requests . Within a few days, Snowden should receive a certificate showing that the request is under consideration, and that certificate will allow him to legally leave the airport's transit area, Kucherena said. Putin: Snowden 'shifting position' on meeting asylum conditions . Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, left Hawaii for Hong Kong this year and leaked NSA documents to the media, sparking worldwide controversy over U.S. surveillance programs. After he publicly identified himself as the leaker last month, he departed Hong Kong for Russia, where he is believed to have been staying in a transit area of the Moscow airport. Snowden's application may be a shift in his position. About two weeks ago, he reportedly withdrew a request for asylum in Russia after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Snowden would need to ""stop his work aimed at harming our American partners"" if he wanted to stay in the country. But on Friday, in a meeting with human rights activists and lawyers, Snowden reportedly said he wanted temporary asylum in Russia while awaiting safe transit to Latin America, and added that he will not harm the United States in the future. The presidents of Venezuela and Bolivia have said their countries would give him asylum, and Nicaragua's president said he would offer it ""if circumstances permit."" But he would need the legal ability to travel there -- something that temporary asylum in Russia could give him. Journalist: Snowden has more documents that could harm U.S. Over the weekend, a journalist who first published the leaked documents said that Snowden has more damaging information that could be a ""nightmare"" for the U.S. government. Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian told an Argentine newspaper, La Nacion, that releasing more information to hurt the United States is not Snowden's goal. However, he said, Snowden has a ""large number"" of documents about software people use ""without consciously agreeing to surrender their rights to privacy."" Snowden has given copies of the papers to several people, Greenwald told the paper, according to an English translation. ""The U.S. government should be on their knees every day praying that nothing happens to Snowden, because if something happens, all information will be revealed, and that would be their worst nightmare,"" he said.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Before Sunday's elections in Catalonia, Artur Mas, president of the region's parliament, promised a referendum on independence for one of Spain's most important regions if he won re-election. But after the election, Mas has a more difficult task because his center-right Convergence and Union coalition lost 12 of its 62 seats, a strong setback for a party that was hoping to gain a simple majority in the 135-seat legislative body. The Catalan Republican Left party was the big winner in the elections, winning 21 seats, according to the Catalonia elections web site, which reported 98% of the votes had been counted. The Catalan Republican Left party also backs independence, and the two parties could form a majority in parliament on the independence issue. They, however, differ on most other issues, especially economic policy. Voters in Catalonia, the most powerful economically of Spain's 17 regions, heeded the call that these would be historic elections, even if independence wasn't on the ballot Sunday. They voted during a deep economic crisis in the eurozone countries, especially in Spain and in Catalonia. Voter turnout was the highest in 24 years for Catalan elections, officials said. The Spanish government in Madrid vows to block any self-determination referendum, arguing that the constitution does not permit a region alone to decide its independence. Last September 11, an estimated 1.5 million people -- 20% of Catalonia's population -- filled the streets of Barcelona, the Catalan capital and Spain's second-largest city, demanding independence. Soon after, Mas called snap regional elections, two years early. His government already has enacted deep spending cuts trying to balance the regional books and has asked Madrid for $6 billion in emergency credit to pay its bills. ""The crisis has made many people in Catalonia desperate,"" said Gonzalo Bernardos, a University of Barcelona economist. ""They see a dark future. Then hope springs, that with Catalan independence, things will be better."" Catalonia has its own flag and language -- Catalan -- and various analysts say the economic crisis has brought long-simmering nationalist sentiment to the forefront. Catalans complain of cultural repression and economic sleights by Madrid dating back centuries. With just 16% of Spain's population, Catalonia produces 19% of the nation's wealth. Catalonia argues that it sends far more in taxes to Madrid than it gets back in central government spending, and that Catalan taxes help support poorer Spanish regions. The regions administer key public services such as health and education, and in Catalonia's case, also the police and prisons. In addition to Mas' party, three other major parties will be closely watched as potential power brokers in the new parliament. The Catalan Republican Left doubled its bloc, as it held just 10 seats before the election. The Catalan branches of Spain's ruling conservative Popular Party -- which opposes independence -- gained one seat, for a total 19 in the new parliament. The main opposition Spanish Socialist Party, which urges a federalist system for the regions, will be the biggest loser, dropping eight seats to 20 representatives. A survey earlier this month by the Catalan government's polling center showed 57% of Catalans would vote for independence, a 6% increase from last June and a 14% increase from a year and a half ago.","Ruling party had hoped to win enough seats for simple majority .

"(CNN) -- If eHarmony or Match.com features more prominently in your ""how we met"" story than a smoky nightclub or the produce aisle, you're probably not so reluctant to admit it. Six out of 10 Americans now believe dating sites are a good way to meet people, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project. That's up from 44% who felt that way in 2005, the last time Pew conducted a similar survey. And barely two out of every 10 people (21%) still feel that ""people who use online dating sites are desperate."" Eight years ago, almost 30% thought so.

According to the survey, conducted with 2,252 adults in April and May, 11% of Internet users, and 38% of those who said they're currently ""single and looking,"" have used online dating sites or apps. Among them, 66% said they went on a date as a result. And nearly one in four (23%) said they actually met a spouse or other long-term partner through the sites. In 2005, 43% who tried online sites actually went on a date. But 17% said they found long-term love, not terribly lower than the recent number. How technology has changed romance . But just because it's more common and accepted doesn't mean Internet mingling (Christian or otherwise) has worked for everyone. More than half the respondents who have tried it (54%) said that someone they'd met had seriously misrepresented themselves in their profiles and more than one out of four (28%) said they'd been contacted through one of the sites ""in a way that made them feel harassed or uncomfortable."" Why traditional dating is dead . That number shoots up to 42% of women who have used dating sites, compared with 17% of men. And maybe it's not all that surprising, but a growing number of people have used the Internet for intimate contact of a less formal nature. Nearly one out of four respondents said they've gone online to check up on former partners, and a similar number said they've flirted with someone on the Web. Young people between 18 and 24 are the most Web-flirtatious. About half (47%) said they've flirted from behind a keyboard. The survey was conducted through telephone interviews in English and Spanish. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points for all respondents and plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for Internet users.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Heavy rains prompted the emergency evacuation Monday of nearly 2,000 residents of a flooding Southern California town and the temporary closure of at least two highways because of mudslides. Meanwhile, as much as 10 feet of additional snow is on tap for the Sierra Nevada, doubling the amount that's fallen in an epic storm on the cusp of the winter solstice. Residents near McFarland were evacuated Monday because of what Fire Department spokesman Sean Collins called ""major flooding."" The evacuation order was later lifted after officials cleared debris from a creek, allowing the flow of water to resume. The area has been inundated with rain for four days, with totals ranging as high as 10 inches. The National Weather Service said additional rain is expected in the area through Tuesday. High winds also whipped much of the state, particularly at high elevations. Peak wind gusts reached 152 mph in Alpine Meadows summit in northern California, the Weather Service reported. Mudslides forced officials to close a portion of State Route 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, in Ventura County from just north of the Los Angeles County line to Oxnard, according to the California Department of Transportation. The Pacific Coast Highway was also closed north of Santa Barbara due to flooding. A mudslide closed a portion of State Route 41 in San Luis Obispo County. A stretch of State Route 34 in the Oxnard area was closed because of flooding. It was unclear when the roads would reopen. The danger of mudslides will probably intensify, CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said. ""A serious situation will develop now with the mudslide danger that will continue over the next several days,"" Cabrera said Monday. The rain was expected to diminish Monday but intensify once again Tuesday night and Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Yet another storm is forecast for Christmas night. The precipitation is part of a massive, moisture-laden West Coast system that will continue to bring more rain and snow to the area through much of the week. A winter storm warning remained in effect through Monday afternoon for California's Sierra Nevada, from Yosemite to Kings Canyon, according to the National Weather Service. ""Storm totals of 5 to 10 feet above 7,000 feet are likely,"" the weather service said, and periods of heavy snow will continue through Monday. High winds are also forecast for the region, which received several feet of snow over the weekend. Forecasters said travel into the high country of the southern Sierra Nevada could be difficult, if not impossible. Mammoth Lakes, California, got almost 9 feet of snow in less than 24 hours, according to Cabrera. On Monday, Sarah Butner of Orange County, California, was visiting family in Mammoth Lakes in the central part of the state. ""We get a lot of snow here but not usually this much in a 24-hour period,"" said Butner, a hairstylist who's also a CNN iReporter. ""The decks have a good 5 feet of snow on them,"" and there's flooding at the end of the neighborhood, she said. ""We're getting a couple inches an hour as of now,"" she said late Monday morning. CNN's Nick Valencia and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Evacuations caused by flooding in Kern County, California are lifted .

"(CNN) -- Playboy magazine recently published its first Hebrew language edition in Israel -- but has anyone actually been reading the articles to notice? According to the publisher of the magazine, launched three months ago with Israeli model Nataly Dadon on the cover and an interview with a former Israeli intelligence chief between the sheets, the country is finally ready for a Hebrew Playboy. ""It's a time when Israel is really joining the family of modern nations, and Playboy is just part of modern global culture,"" says Dan Pomerantz, who emigrated from his native Chicago to Israel 15 months ago. ""The brand has been popular (in Israel) for a long time and a Hebrew language magazine can really reach the entire market, whereas the English language version is really a niche commodity."" With its third issue about to hit the newsstands, Pomerantz contends that the public are becoming more comfortable with the magazine's content, while interest from potential advertisers, interview subjects and potential Playboy ""bunnies"" is growing -- the magazine's website has a form for would-be models to apply. ""So far we haven't had a negative reaction,"" says Pomerantz, who acknowledges that many conservative and ultra-orthodox religious groups would ""not want to interact with the brand."" Read more: Butlers in demand in Gulf states . Earlier attempts to launch adult magazines in Israel met greater opposition. Galia Albin, the publisher who introduced Penthouse Magazine into the country in 1989, remembers a torrid 11 months before she sold the title. The reaction by religious groups was so fierce that the printing press was threatened with arson. ""It wasn't easy,"" she said. ""Good luck to (Playboy), I think they are brave. Israel is open in some ways but in magazines, no."" Albin admits that she wanted a marketing gimmick that would cause a stir, but maintains that the magazine was introduced for more than just shock value, standing for a more liberal, secular society. ""Back then, secular Jews didn't think they had rights,"" she says. Some observers believe that reading the Hebrew edition of Playboy could still be seen as political statement. ""Playboy makes a very specific claim,"" says Hugo Schwyzer, the American author and commentator on gender studies. ""It doesn't see itself as political, but it is political -- it advocates for hedonism and sexual pleasure and the right for women to bare their body in public... Those are deeply political statements in Israel in a way that they are not really political in other countries."" However, for those on Israel's liberal left, Playboy's arrival in Hebrew is more like dusting off a relic from a bygone era. ""If you want nudity, there's the internet,"" says Sarah Tuttle-Singer, a blogger for the Times of Israel. ""I'm not seeing very much fuss (in public about the launch of the magazine). If they wanted to be interesting, they should have women wearing prayer shawls -- and only prayer shawls -- standing in front of the Kotel (Wailing Wall). ""That might be scandalous, controversial, and at least something that we've not seen before. Unless the articles are holding their own merit, I don't see the interest,"" she said , noting that the Hebrew edition's Facebook page has only around 5,800 ""likes."" Gallery: Dubai's stunning skyline . Content aside, launching a new print publication, albeit with a well-known brand name, is still something of a business risk, when increasingly people use internet to find whatever they want, mostly for free. ""We don't see ourselves as a magazine company,"" says Pomerantz. ""High-quality content is what we provide. We are going to relaunch our website and give our audience a whole other avenue to reach us. What we've found is that the printed magazine gives us a certain gravitas."" From a business standpoint, the launch could be seen as part of the brand's global strategy to diversify, as its magazine sales have steadily declined since their high point in the 1970s. According to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. print publication loses around $6 million each year and uses licensing to international editions as a way to offset the losses. The familiar bunny logo is now more likely to be seen on clothing, jewelry, luggage or condoms than magazine covers. For all the potential pitfalls of print publishing and dealing with controversial content, Pomerantz remains bullish about the magazine's ability to push a few boundaries. ""From the statistics on our website and Facebook, we can tell that a number of our followers are Arab speakers and Palestinians within Israel and neighboring countries,"" he says. ""We are looking forward to putting together special content specifically to target the Arab market. We've seen so far a real interest that we want to encourage.""","March saw the launch of Playboy magazine's first edition in Hebrew .

"(CNN) -- About 15 years ago, when the United States was first experimenting with wide-ranging sanctions against Iran, an Iranian acquaintance remarked to me, ""I certainly hope Iran doesn't become another Cuba."" At that point, the U.S. had imposed a total embargo on Cuba for more than three decades. As he said it, I detected that part of him could not believe that a rich and cultured nation on the other side of the globe could ever be treated like an island dictatorship off the American coast. But I also saw a glint of apprehension in his eyes as he considered for the first time how America's vision of its own national interests could change when viewed through the prism of raw domestic politics. The cases are not at all the same. Yet today, Cuba has been under U.S. embargo for 50 years, and Iran has passed the 16-year mark. Cuba experienced a U.S.-sponsored invasion before the sanctions began. Iran is still waiting for its Bay of Pigs. When the Obama administration came into office, talk was all about ""smart sanctions."" President Obama's foreign policy advisers had seen what indiscriminate sanctions had done to Iraq. Ordinary lives were destroyed and, in the words of a friend whose family was in Iraq, the entire middle class was criminalized, driven to smuggling and black-market dealings just to survive. The sanctions also created a sympathetic backlash with the Iraqi population and visceral anti-Americanism throughout the world. We were not going to make that mistake again. Instead, we would target sanctions only against the decision-makers and abusers. Yet today, the sanctions regime in Iran is resembling, more and more, the Iraqi and Cuban cases. We have arrived by a very different route. Instead of controlling all goods going into the country, we have ingeniously found ways of manipulating Iran's banking system. That, together with regional boycotts, has the prospect of blocking a large proportion of Iran's oil sales. In Iran there has been a run on the currency, food prices are soaring, and every single person is beginning to experience some form of economic pain. That has been the source of considerable public satisfaction in Washington and elsewhere. It is also reminiscent of the early stages of the Iraqi experience. Add to that the serial murders of civilian scientists, cybertampering with Iran's centrifuges, flyovers of U.S. drones, and covert assistance to Iranian separatist groups. Forget the euphemisms. What would we think if a nation were doing all of this to us? The benign image of sanctions as graduated pressure has been transformed. In reality, it is war with Iran in all but name. Until now, the threat of escalation has been a tool for promoting sanctions. I remember vividly my own experience in the White House during the original Iranian hostage crisis. At that time, President Carter and his National Security Council staff quite deliberately used the threat of a possible U.S. military action against Iran to encourage Europeans and other allies to adopt sanctions against Iran. The purpose of the sanctions was to persuade Iran to release the American diplomatic hostages. It didn't work. The threat of military action was, however, very effective in getting allies to take economic actions that were contrary to their own national interests. The thinking was that economic sanctions and boycotts, however disagreeable, were less costly than the outbreak of a military conflict in the oil-rich Persian Gulf. The same tactic was used by the George W. Bush administration to twist the arms of reluctant allies. The presence of such uber-hawks as Vice President Dick Cheney, U.N. Ambassador John Bolton and others, as well as the formal security doctrine of the administration to launch pre-emptive military attacks, gave the argument credibility. Upon the arrival of the Obama administration and its initial policy of engagement with Iran, the role of enforcer shifted to Israel. The first major media storm about an Israeli attack on Iran came in the final months of the Bush administration, when John Bolton predicted without qualification in an interview with The Daily Telegraph that Israel would launch its attack before Bush left office, on the grounds that the incoming administration would be less sympathetic to the idea. Since then, such predictions have become almost an annual event. Jeffrey Goldberg, writing in the Atlantic Monthly in September 2010 after extensive interviews with key Israelis, concluded that ""there is a better than 50 percent chance that Israel will launch a strike by next July,"" 2011. That date came and went. Then about a month ago, Israeli commentator Ronen Bergman wrote in The New York Times magazine that ""After speaking with many senior Israeli leaders and chiefs of the military and the intelligence, I have come to believe that Israel will indeed strike Iran in 2012."" It is a bit ironic that Bergman spoke to the same individuals who had previously convinced Goldberg that a strike was coming in 2011. Moreover, many of those interviewed openly expressed great doubt about the feasibility and wisdom of any such attack. This included the recently retired Mossad chief Meir Dagan and the former Israeli chief of staff Gabi Ashkenazi, who said that ""the Iranian threat was not as imminent"" as some had suggested and that ""a military strike would be catastrophic."" But the article resonated powerfully, especially in an election year. Congress has been extremely active in trying to prevent the administration from pursuing negotiations. H.R. 1905 -- the Iran Threat Reduction Act of 2011 -- proposes to ban U.S. diplomats from contact with ""any Iranian official who poses a threat to the United States."" There is scarcely anyone in Iran who has not chanted ""Death to America""; does that constitute a threat and disqualify that person from contact with American diplomats? More recently, a proposed Sense of the Senate resolution tries to define the terms and acceptable objectives of any United States policy dealing with Iran: . â€¢ It rejects ""any policy that would rely on containment as an option in response to the Iranian nuclear threat,"" thus ruling out a policy that the United States used successfully against the Soviet Union. â€¢ It defines the U.S. ""red line,"" where we would consider the use of force, not as Iranian possession of a nuclear weapon, but rather as an Iranian ""nuclear weapons capability,"" which by many calculations Iran already has. â€¢ Finally, it sets as the objective of any negotiations ""the full and sustained suspension"" of uranium enrichment by Iran. But Iran regards enrichment for peaceful purposes as a right conferred by the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and that principle is supported by a vast majority of the Iranian population, including even the reformist opposition. This resolution is not binding, and it does not yet have majority support in the Senate. However, it is apparently intended to be used as a centerpiece in the pro-Israeli AIPAC meeting that started this weekend in Washington. And it comes just at the moment when it appears that negotiations between Tehran and six major powers are likely to resume. There is an inevitability about sanctions imposed for political reasons. Serious negotiations and compromise are precluded, and the appetite for ever-stronger sanctions grows with the realization that past efforts were a failure. If you set an impossible objective and then begin imposing sanctions to achieve it, the result is always more sanctions, until you arrive at the point where there are no more sanctions and only force remains. We are approaching that point. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gary Sick.","Gary Sick: Sanctions against Iraq, Cuba harmed the whole population, not just leaders .
Sick: Sanctions against Iran causing anti-Americanism and ruining ordinary lives .
16 years of Iran sanctions changed nothing, he says, amount to war in all but name .

"(CNN) -- Wicked weather dominated much of the American Midwest and westward on Friday. A tornado laden storm shocked the people of Wayne, Nebraska, as afternoon turned to evening. The National Weather Service reported Saturday, based on a preliminary assessment, that the Wayne twister produced EF-4 damage -- which means it likely carried gusts of between 166 and 200 mph. A few people sustained minor injuries, but luckily no one was killed, said mayor Ken Chamberlain. The storm produced one or several tornadoes, officials said, that touched down in five spots. Louisville flooding: Knee-deep water could get worse . ""The primary damage is mostly in the industrial area of Wayne,"" Chamberlain said. ""Approximately 10-12 houses were destroyed but everyone is accounted for and safe."" The storm flipped cars, trapping motorists and ruptured a natural gas line in Wayne, the state's emergency management agency said. ""Hazmat is on the scene dealing with the gas leakage,"" said spokeswoman Jodie Fawl. The American Red Cross is sending teams to the scene, said Liz Dorland of the agency's Nebraska/Southwest Iowa regional chapter. The agency is ""working with local authorities and emergency management to see what the needs are and (to) respond as needed,"" she said. Fifteen people injured by the storm were taken to Providence Medical Center in Wayne, hospital spokesperson Sandra Bartling said. No deaths from the tornado had been reported, officials said. Farther west, in Rapid City, South Dakota, and in eastern Wyoming, a winter storm caused locals to take cover. Half the approximately 60,000 residents of Rapid City were without power as of Friday evening, said Jerry Reichert, a battalion chief with the Rapid City Fire Department. Reichert said firefighters responded to reports of several people stuck in the road because of the weather. At least one tree landed on the roof of a home on Friday, but Reichert said he was not aware of any fatalities or injuries as of Friday evening. In the morning, Rapid City police issued a ""no travel"" advisory for the city. They described conditions as ""deteriorating quickly"" and warned travelers that visibility was ""at about a quarter-mile."" Police also warned that ""thick slush on the roads is causing vehicles to hydroplane."" Tropical Storm Karen weakens . In Wyoming, road closures also dominated travel. A dispatcher for the Wyoming Highway Patrol said the majority of Interstate 25 in the state had been shut because of bad weather. A small stretch in the middle of the state, around Casper, remained open, but it was restricted to necessary travel, the dispatcher said. Dave Kingham, a spokesman for the Wyoming Department of Transportation, said Interstate 80 westbound between Laramie, Wyoming, and Cheyenne, Wyoming, was closed after an early evening accident. On the eastbound side of that same stretch, Kingham said, the ""chain law"" was in effect. That means vehicles must use chains or snow tires to travel the interstate legally. On average, Kingham said, the closed stretch of I-80 accommodates about 6,000 vehicles each day. Hidden in National Weather Service forecast: P-L-E-A-S-E-P-A-Y-U-S .

"(CNN) -- When a street artist paints a mural on a wall, who owns the artwork? By Saturday evening, the answer could be ""someone else,"" at least in the case of ""Slave Labour,"" a work of renowned artist Banksy. The mural showed up on the wall of a Poundland discount store in North London's Haringey neighborhood during the queen's Jubilee last May. It depicts a young boy sewing British flags and was thought to be a commentary on sweatshop labor, something that hit home in the working class neighborhood. ""It represents the struggle of the community in general,"" one resident told the BBC. And it was something positive for locals. ""I felt a twinge of pride that something other than cheap tat was drawing people to our high road. ""It brought much-needed positive attention to Wood Green instead of the usual ugly image often spread in the news and on Twitter,"" Rachella Sinclair wrote in Tottenham & Wood Green Journal. But last week, residents noticed some work was being done around the 4-foot-by-5-foot mural, with scaffolding and a tarpaulin put up. ""This morning I had a sneaky look under said tarpaulin to find it had been removed,"" wrote blogger AntK on Harringay Online. ""I spoke to the guy rendering the wall and he said that after repeated attempts to gouge it out, the owner of the Poundland building had decided to take steps to 'preserve' it."" The preservation seems to have taken the piece to Miami, where ""Slave Labour"" has turned up in the catalog of Fine Art Auctions in Miami. It's expected to go under the gavel on Saturday with a price range of $500,000 to $700,000 as part of a collection of ""Modern, Contemporary and Street Art."" That has the North London locals angry. ""Banksy gave that piece of art to our community,"" local council member Alan Strickland is quoted as saying by the BBC. He called the artwork a ""piece of art that was given freely has been taken away from them."" Not so, said the Miami auctioneer. ""Some people in England are complaining that the work had been stolen. That's absolutely incorrect because the work was painted on a private wall and the owner of a private wall can do whatever he wants with his own wall,"" Frederick Thut said in a BBC interview. ""We take a lot of care with our consignors, who they are, what they do, and if there's any illegality we will not touch it. Everything is checked out 150%,"" the Guardian quoted Thut as saying. For its part Poundland tweeted that it is not responsible for removing the art . ""We do not own the building. It is not ours to remove,"" the store tweeted. ""We've been unable to reach landlord's agents today but would like to reiterate that we in no way condone the artwork removal,"" another tweet said. Banksy himself is known to be reclusive and has made no official comment on the controversy. But on the frequently asked questions page of his website, he poses the question: ""What do you think about the auction houses selling street art?"" He quotes artist Henri Matisse for his answer: ""I was very embarrassed when my canvases began to fetch high prices, I saw myself condemned to a future of painting nothing but masterpieces.""","4-foot-by-5-foot Banksy mural was on London store .

"(CNN) -- A salmonella outbreak linked to alfalfa sprouts has sickened 89 people in 15 states and the District of Columbia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday. About 23% of those sickened were hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported, according to the CDC. Health officials say the first cases identified date to November 1. The preliminary investigation shows a possible link to alfalfa sprouts. ""Preliminary results of this investigation indicate a link to eating alfalfa sprouts at a national sandwich chain,"" the CDC said in a statement. In Illinois, where the bulk of cases have been identified, the state Department of Public Health says many of 50 sickened residents reported eating alfalfa sprouts at locations of Jimmy John's. The founder of Jimmy John's said test results of sprouts from its main supplier tested negative. In a letter sent to all Jimmy John's franchises, founder Jimmy John Liautaud said store locations have all come up negative for the bacteria as well. ""As a goodfaith and goodwill gesture I am asking Illinois stores to pull sprouts until the state can give us some better direction,"" the letter states. ""We are working closely with the state and they are doing a darn good job in helping find the source. Again, no source has been found yet, this is a precautionary measure."" According to the CDC, Illinois has 50 cases, Missouri reports 14 cases, Indiana reports 9, Wisconsin has three and Pennsylvania reports two. Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and the District of Columbia all have one confirmed case . The CDC is working with the Food and Drug Administration and state public health departments to investigate this outbreak. Health officials have identified the particular strain of salmonella through diagnostic testing. The strain has been identified as Salmonella serotype I 4,[5],12:i:-. This is a common type of salmonella, says Chris Braden, a physician and director of the CDC's Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases. ""Alfalfa sprouts have been associated with a number of outbreaks"" Braden adds. The FDA and state health departments will be investigating the sprout growers, as well as the seed suppliers, in an effort to find the source the outbreak, Braden said. ""The FDA is aware of the situation and is working with the CDC to determine the cause of the illnesses,"" Michael Herndon, a FDA spokesman, confirmed Thursday. ""As more information becomes available we will alert the public."" Salmonella is a bacterial infection that usually last four to seven days. The infected person develops fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea between 12 and 72 hours after becoming infected. Most people recover without treatment. Very young and very old people, as well as those with weakened immune systems, can suffer severe illness and, in the worst cases, possibly death, according to the CDC. About 40,000 cases of salmonella are reported each year in the United States, the agency said. The CDC recommends anyone suspecting he or she may be ill from eating contaminated food should talk to their doctor. Pregnant women, children and the elderly should avoid eating all raw or undercooked sprouts, the CDC suggests. The only way the bacteria can be killed is by thoroughly cooking the sprouts.","CDC says 89 people have been sickened .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Diana Nyad is back at it again -- once more in the waters off Havana and heading, she hopes, to Key West, Florida. The 62-year-old endurance athlete jumped into waters off Cuba on Saturday afternoon, a day earlier than she and her Xtreme Dream team had originally planned, according to her Twitter page. If all goes well, she will swim some 103 miles and 60 hours before arriving in the Florida Keys. ""Right now, (the water) is fantastic and so (the team) has been brainstorming and thinking, we've got to get out there,"" Nyad said at a Saturday news conference, explaining the decision to start early. Shortly before 10:30 p.m. Saturday, nearly seven hours into her journey, a new Twitter message from Nyad's team indicated the swimmer had been ""stung by a jellyfish."" An update a few minutes later indicated she was stung at 8:40 p.m., ""was treated and continued swimming."" ""(Nyad) is OK and strong,"" the message said. Nyad has tried three times before to venture across the Straits of Florida. Each attempt ended prematurely -- starting in 1978 when rocky seas left her battered, delirious and less than halfway toward her goal and twice last year, once done in by an 11-hour asthma attack and later thwarted by box jellyfish stings. But those aborted swims haven't deterred her, and she insisted earlier this week that ""I'm ready."" ""I'm feeling some pressure,"" she said Friday. ""I'm feeling tremendous inner pressure that this has got to be it, this has got to be the last time."" She's in the water without a physical shark cage, relying on electronic shark repellent and a team of divers to keep them away. Sharks are just one of the many challenges the American citizen will face, from the sheer physical strain to smacks of jellyfish and the whims of Mother Nature. That latter consideration drove the decision to push up the scheduled Sunday start time. The wind is predicted ""to be getting really calm by (Sunday) morning and staying calm ... through Monday, and coming up a little bit on Tuesday but still just fine for us to get in,"" Nyad said. The hope is to avoid deteriorating conditions caused by stronger winds expected Tuesday night and into Wednesday, which happens to be Nyad's 63rd birthday. ""We've got to get out there,"" she said. In the 1970s, Nyad was unstoppable. In addition to winning multiple swimming marathons, she was one of the first women to encircle the island of Manhattan, and she holds the world's record for longest ocean swim -- 102.5 miles from the island of Bimini in the Bahamas to Jupiter, Florida. She said Saturday that she was 8 years old when she first dreamed about the possibility of swimming across the Straits of Florida. -- At the time, she was in Cuba on a trip from her home in Florida in the 1950s, before Fidel Castro led a Communist takeover in Cuba and its relations with the United States soured. ""I used to stand on the beach and I said to my mother, 'I wonder if anybody could swim over there,"" Nyad recalled saying, while pointing to the Keys. While admitting that she's a slower swimmer now than she once was, Nyad insists that in her 60s she still feels ""vital (and) powerful"" -- and definitely ""not old."" A successful swim ideally will inspire people her age and older not to let their age hinder them, Nyad said. ""When I walk up on that shore in Florida, I want millions of those AARP sisters and brothers to look at me and say, 'I'm going to go write that novel I thought it was too late to do. I'm going to go work in Africa on that farm that those people need help at. I'm going to adopt a child. It's not too late, I can still live my dreams,'"" she said. CNN's Matt Sloane contributed to this report.","NEW: A jellyfish stings Diana Nyad, but she is OK, her team says .

"(CNN) -- Desperately overcrowded, unsanitary, seething with tension and violence. Hours after a fatal fire swept through a prison in the central Honduran city of Comayagua, killing more than 300 people, an ugly picture is emerging of the harsh state of prisons in the country. And while the cause of the fire in Comayagua is not yet clear, observers say the conditions in which its inmates live are likely to have contributed to the high death toll. Ron W. Nikkel, president of Prison Fellowship International, an international nongovernmental organization, says Comayagua is the worst prison he's visited in the country. ""It's horrifically overcrowded. The bunks are sometimes five, six, seven tiers high, with the lowest person on the totem pole sleeping underneath the bunk on the bottom,"" he told CNN from Washington. ""I've seldom been anywhere where I've seen such overcrowding. There have been a number of fires over the years and it's surprising it hasn't been worse or happened sooner than this. ""You wouldn't have congestion like that in a dog pound, it's so bad -- and very little ventilation, so I can imagine a lot of the guys died from smoke inhalation."" The conditions in the packed, airless dormitories are oppressive, depressing and inhuman, he said. ""You wonder how the human person can adapt to living in those conditions, but they do."" The fact that the fire broke out overnight means most of the prison's 850 inmates would have been asleep as the flames took hold. And once the alarm was raised, the authorities' response is likely to have been hampered by short staffing and poor staff training, said professor Andrew Coyle of the International Center for Prison Studies at the University of Essex in the United Kingdom. Many prisons across Central America are run-down, with crumbling infrastructure and poor maintenance, Coyle told CNN. An inevitable consequence is lax adherence to health and safety guidelines and fire prevention, making the chances of a devastating fire that much higher, he said. Nationwide, Honduras -- a country of about 8 million -- has capacity for about 8,000 prisoners but had nearly 12,000 incarcerated as of 2010, equating to 40% overcrowding, Coyle said. The U.S. State Department raised concerns in a report last year, citing human rights groups as saying prisoners ""suffered from severe overcrowding, malnutrition, and lack of adequate sanitation,"" and highlighting issues of violence and abuse. The Comayagua blaze was the third fatal prison fire in recent years. In 2003, 61 prisoners were killed in a fire at a prison in La Ceiba. In 2004, the death toll was 107 from a fire in a San Pedro Sula prison. The country's prison commissioner said authorities are looking into whether a short circuit sparked the latest fire or if a prisoner perhaps set a mattress on fire. But questions are bound to be asked about the effectiveness of the authorities' response. Human rights group Amnesty International called for a full and impartial investigation into what happened at Comayagua on Wednesday. ""The government must also take urgent steps to ensure that crucial lessons are learned and prison conditions are improved, so that such a tragedy does not occur again,"" said Esther Major, Central America Researcher at Amnesty. Another rights group, Human Rights Watch, pointed the finger at overcrowding and criticized the Honduran authorities for failing to address the conditions in which suspects and convicts are held. ""Endemic violence, the very poor infrastructure, poor staffing, badly trained staff -- all of these factors combined means that when something goes wrong, there's a grave danger of loss of life and inability of the authorities to cope,"" Coyle said. Gang membership is also an issue in the region's prisons, said Coyle. Prisoners who don't already belong to a gang, or mara, when they enter jail soon sign up as a matter of survival. Nikkel says that from what he's seen, a majority of the inmates at Comayagua are young men aged 18 to 25 and many are affiliated with gangs. About half are being held pre-trial, so they have not yet had their cases heard in court, let alone been sentenced. Some may spend years waiting, a sign of the country's painfully slow judicial process, Nikkel said. That adds to the sense of injustice and pent-up frustration in prison. While he said he hasn't seen violence between inmates or on the part of prison staff during his visits, Nikkel said it is widely reported. ""You can certainly see the tension when you go in with regards to the stand-off between various gangs controlling certain areas,"" he said. ""But Honduras has been notorious for the violence of the system against inmates, and part of that is due to the inadequate training of prison officers but also because they are subjected to the same overcrowding, which in these conditions is very difficult at the best of times."" Comayagua's prison director was shot last year by gang members unhappy with the restrictions placed on their compatriots inside the prison, Nikkel said. Sanitation in that prison is woefully inadequate, he added, with ""awful"" washing and toilet facilities. Drugs are as easily available inside prison as on the streets, Nikkel added. Corruption is also a big problem, with those who have powerful gang connections on the outside able to call the shots. ""I've seen guards providing women for prostitution to inmates in an organized way, very open, so the whole thing is seething with endemic corruption that feeds the violence,"" Nikkel said. A similar situation exists in other Central American countries, he said. ""With the gangs being able to pay more to the guards than the guards are getting in salaries, the power is where the money is."" While there has been much talk of taking on the corruption in the prison sector, Nikkel said, the chances of it are slim while other parts of civil society are also riddled with corruption. Staff and volunteers with Prison Fellowship International are working to provide education and practical projects, such as growing food, to combat the chronic lack of anything for inmates to do, Nikkel said, and to give them some hope. The organization also runs a program that sends medical teams into the country's prisons to treat such ailments as skin and dental problems, eye infections, and malnutrition, he said. Coyle says there is recognition across most of the region that the current prison conditions are unacceptable, in terms of violence and poor infrastructure, but many obstacles lie in the way of reform. ""You cannot reform a prison system in isolation from the rest of civil society -- and where civil society is violent and dangerous and destructive, it's no great surprise that it extends into the rest of the prison.""","NEW: Rights group Amnesty International calls for urgent action to prevent future prison deaths .

"(CNN) -- Android continues to dominate in the battle to be the top smartphone system in the world, thanks in part to Samsung, which reigned as the top phone manufacturer for 2012. Android grew its already significant chunk of the smartphone market to 68.8% last year, while Apple's iOS operating system stayed comfortably in second place with 18.8% of smartphone shipments, according to new stats from research firm IDC. Together, the two operating systems accounted for 87.6% of all new smartphones in 2012, leaving struggling competitors BlackBerry and Windows far behind. It's no surprise that Android has surged so far ahead of iOS. There are are thousands of Android handset models in every size and at every price imaginable, while Apple has released only six versions of the iPhone. Apple sold 130 million smartphones last year, according to Gartner. ""Even with the Apple Maps debacle, iPhone owners were not deterred from purchasing new iPhones,"" said IDC research manager Ramon Llamas in a statement. Apple released one new iOS phone in 2012, the much-anticipated iPhone 5. However, according to Gartner it was previous iPhone models, which dropped in price enough to make them a more appealing option in emerging markets, that accounted for much of Apple's smartphone success. Even though Apple's sales are growing, IDC points out that its year-over-year growth is actually slower when compared with the rest of the smartphone market. Samsung sold 384.6 million phones in 2012, only 53.5% of which were smartphones, according to Gartner. Chinese phone maker Huawei climbed to the No.3 smartphone vendor spot in the final quarter of 2012. Nokia has been struggling and 2013 will be a key year for the company. Its fate is largely tied to that of Windows Phone 8, which runs on Nokia's latest Lumia phones. Both BlackBerry and Windows are compteting to win over smartphone customers with their new offerings. BlackBerry just released its long-awaited new smartphone operating system and two new handsets in January, and Microsoft debuted its Windows Phone 8 update at the end of 2012. BlackBerry must persuade its existing users to make the upgrade and win back some large companies, which were previously its biggest customers. Unlike BlackBerry, Windows Phone 8 unveiled its new products and marketing campaign early enough to make some progress last year. Though it only made up 2.6% of the smartphone market in 2012, it did grow its number of shipments an impressive 98.9%, according to IDC. BlackBerry plummeted 36.4% from the previous year, but we'll have to wait and see how its latest products do in the fresh year. Overall, the number of phone sales in 2012 actually dropped 1.7% from the previous year, the first drop since 2009. ""Tough economic conditions, shifting consumer preferences and intense market competition weakened the worldwide mobile phone market this year,"" Gartner analyst Anshul Gupta said in a statement.","Reports: Android, Apple make up vast majority of global smartphone sales .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- While it's not a stretch to imagine the Edward Snowden saga would spawn books and movies, a group of amateur filmmakers in Hong Kong have already beaten Hollywood to the punch with a short thriller dramatizing the events that unfolded in the city last month. On June 9, Snowden identified himself as the source of leaked classified documents exposing mass surveillance programs purportedly operated by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The American computer technician also revealed he had been hiding out in Hong Kong for three weeks, sparking widespread speculation about his exact whereabouts and whether he would find safe refuge in the territory -- a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China. Two days later, freelance videographer Edwin Lee contacted a few friends about shooting a short film about the maelstrom swirling around Snowden in the city. ""We were so intrigued as to why Snowden came to Hong Kong,"" Lee said, an Irish expatriate. ""All of us love Hong Kong to death; we all call Hong Kong home."" The five-minute film was shot over four days, Lee said, describing it as a ""foot-on-the-gas"" guerrilla operation. The script was mostly written the day before shooting and actors had no rehearsal time, he added. Yet the final product is surprisingly suspenseful and sophisticated, with gorgeous time-lapse panoramas of the city and ""shaky cam"" shots reminiscent of Hollywood. (Lee, who was largely in charge of cinematography and editing, named the Bourne film series and director Michael Mann as inspirations.) In its first week, the film has garnered over 43,000 views on Youtube. While Lee and his three co-directors/producers took creative license with plot details, such as an imagined briefing between a mainland Ministry of State Security attaché and Hong Kong police, they also filmed scenes inside the same hotel where Snowden had stayed and shot a video interview with The Guardian. Renting the hotel room cost half of their estimated HK$4,200 budget (US$ 540), Lee said. The actor who played Snowden in the film also bears a remarkable similarity to the man himself, to the extent that the hairdresser who cut off the actor's ""long shaggy hair"" to mirror Snowden's photo warned him afterward not to be mistaken for the fugitive, said co-producer Shawn Tse, who orchestrated his makeover. Curiously Snowden has no dialogue in the film. ""Yes the film was about Snowden, but he wasn't featured the most prominently,"" Lee said, adding that the team was careful not to impose judgments upon a man who largely remains a mystery to them. ""He's mostly the catalyst [of events] affecting all these different people around him; it's more about the vignettes,"" Lee said , describing the film's focus as split ""50-50"" between Snowden and the city of Hong Kong. Rather, the film is intended more as a homage to Hong Kong by a group of expatriates who love the city. ""We tried to give Hong Kong the limelight we think it deserves,"" Tse said. Describing a ""very muted response to the Snowden affair"" from Hong Kong and the Chinese central government, Lee also acknowledged an underlying political critique in invoking the Ministry of State Security attaché. The scene was intended as a ""vehicle to represent (Hong Kong's) relationship with China"" and the murkiness of Beijing's role in the Snowden affair. ""To say China wasn't pulling any strings at all would be naïve ... Even though it gives us autonomy, it's always Beijing that calls the shots,"" Lee said. In a keen cultural detail, the attaché speaks in Mandarin, while the officers respond in Cantonese. Hong Kong authorities have denied that China influenced Snowden's decision to leave the city. While Lee said Snowden's sudden departure didn't cut their project short, he said it hastened the editing process to get the film out. He said there are no plans to extend the film or shoot a sequel, now that Snowden has left the city.","Group of amateur filmmakers in Hong Kong made thriller about Snowden's time in the city .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Our politics have changed in America -- and, unfortunately, not for the better. With the Robert Bork hearings of the 1980s and later the Monica Lewinsky affair of the 1990s, we were introduced to the ""politics of personal destruction."" Today, we're living with the hangover and learning how destructive it can be when we take our politics personally. We're a nation divided, where people can no longer agree to disagree without becoming downright nasty. Cafferty: How many debates needed? Just ask Stacey Dash, an African-American actress who was attacked on Twitter for abandoning her support for Obama and daring to publicly endorse Mitt Romney for president. The actress, who starred in the movie ""Clueless"" and the cable TV drama ""Single Ladies,"" tweeted: ""Vote for Romney. The only choice for your future. Team Romney...Vote Romney."" The liberal Twitteratti went crazy. One Twitter user wrote about Dash, who is also half Mexican-American, ""You're an unemployed black woman endorsing Mitt Romney. You're voting against yourself thrice. You poor beautiful idiot."" Another chimed in with: ""I guess 'Clueless' star Stacey Dash endorsing Mitt Romney shows that she is indeed clueless."" But the really ugly barbs came from fellow African-Americans who tweeted that Dash was a ""jigaboo,"" ""traitor,"" ""house n-----."" You get the picture. Many went further, urging Dash to do everyone a favor and ""kill urself."" Stacey Dash defends pro-Romney stance . Or ask Buzz Bissinger, a columnist for The Daily Beast who must have felt as if he was trapped in an episode of ""Liberals Gone Wild"" after announcing that he had -- after the first presidential debate in Denver -- decided to support Mitt Romney for president. A self-described ""lifelong Democrat,"" Bissinger wrote in a column after the first presidential debate that he could ""no longer back a president who no longer acted like he wanted to be president, who offered a vision for the country as original as those college essays you can buy off the Internet, who in front of 70 million viewers acted like he had 90 minutes to kill before going out to dinner with Michelle for their 20th anniversary."" Bissinger was castigated by his wife and friends and liberal readers, who through what the columnist described as ""thousands of comments on The Daily Beast website and Twitter and Facebook; writers from national media outlets trying to pick the column apart because they were outraged that one they considered part of the tribe, a journalist and author, would actually turn away from the ingrained liberal leanings of the profession."" His takeaway: ""Liberals preach tolerance, but 90% are every bit as nasty and vitriolic as the conservatives they rightfully condemn for being nasty and vitriolic."" And ask Cornel West, one of the country's most prominent African Americans, who last year went into the liberal doghouse when he criticized Obama for abandoning African Americans and the working class. West called Obama a ""black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs and a black puppet of corporate plutocrats."" He won the wrath of the Rev. Al Sharpton, and fellow academic Melissa Harris-Perry responded by slamming West for making a ""self-aggrandizing, victimology sermon."" Photos: Why your vote counts . Of course, conservatives also know full well how to level personal attacks. Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh stepped in it when he demeaned Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke as a ""slut"" after she testified before Congress about the importance of requiring univeristy health insurance plans to cover birth control. Radio talk show host Glenn Beck, who formerly hosted a daily talk show on the Fox News Channel, once said that President Obama was ""a racist"" who had ""exposed himself over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture."" Then there are all those tea party activists, some of which, in combating Obamacare, thought nothing of holding up racist signs depicting the president as an African witch doctor. Naturally. At the end of the day, labels like ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" don't mean much. Human beings are all the same. Some are raised to be tolerant of different points of view, others not so much. The more secure you are in what you believe, the less likely you are to attack someone for believing something else. Opinion: I'm Mormon, and I'm voting for Obama . Meanwhile, in this country, a lot of people seem to be on the attack. If you oppose the president, his supporters will call you a racist; if you support him, his opponents will call you a socialist. You're either accused of not loving your fellow man or not loving your country. It's all part of where we've arrived, and how we've changed. We wear our ideologies on our sleeves. We keep our political views, and presidential choices, close to our hearts. And so when they're challenged, we feel personally wounded. So we get angry. These days, if you challenge someone's point of view or disagree with their choice in candidates, it's as if you're directly attacking them. It used to be that Americans could disagree over politics and still go out and have a drink. Not anymore. Nowadays, if you disagree, one of you isn't just wrong. One of you is a bad person. And who wants to go drinking with a bad person? Now, almost everything about politics seems less cerebral and more emotional. The business is no longer about compromising with your opponent; it's about conquering him. We don't just disagree; we're out to destroy. We don't settle for half a loaf; it's all or nothing. The goal isn't to find solutions; the objective is simply to win at all costs. McCain weighs in on war of words over Libya . After Tuesday's presidential debate, Obama was criticized by some Republicans for being too combative. But judging from the polls, Democrats are delighted with Obama's aggressive stance, and they want more of the same in the final debate next week. As for what got us to this point, maybe the politicians are to blame for leading the way, with their negative ads and their tendency to treat every political campaign like a contact sport. Or maybe it's generational, a result of what happens when baby boomers -- who, since the Vietnam War, have believed their values were superior to everyone else's -- control the government. Or maybe it comes from living in the Internet age in which everyone has an opinion and feels entitled to express it freely and without apology. Four years ago, with the election of Barack Obama, it looked as if the United States had taken a giant step forward. Now, it looks as if we're going backward.

"(CNN) -- A group of chemical weapons inspectors are taking the world closer to peace in the middle of a raging war that they cannot stop. For this they will receive the Nobel Peace Prize Tuesday. The award ceremony begins at 11 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET) in Oslo, Norway. The prize consists of a medal, a diploma and a cash award of 8 million Swedish kroner (nearly $1.2 million). Many were surprised when the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced in October that the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons had won the award for work just begun in Syria to eliminate its poison gas stockpiles. Even the recipients seemed blindsided. When the committee rang their headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands, no one picked up the phone. There had been vigorous speculation in the world's press about who might take home the medal: Possibly Pakistan's girls' education activist Malala Yousufzai, the teen who was shot for trumpeting her cause, or Congolese physician Denis Mukwege, who treats victims of gang rape. But, intended or not, the committee shifted the focus of the public eye back onto the war in Syria, which it seems to have lost sight of. Its stated aim in choosing the OPCW was to point out the progress in eliminating chemical weapons around the world. Global signal . ""We wanted to give a signal to the world that now we have the possibility to do away with a whole category of weapons of mass destruction,"" said Thorbjorn Jagland, chairman of the Nobel Committee. This year also marks the 20-year anniversary of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which created the OPCW and calls on signatories to destroy their stockpiles. ""Eighty percent of chemical weapons have been eliminated and more than 90 percent of production capacity,"" Jagland said. He wants to see the rest of it go, too. Few had heard of the OPCW before it was tasked with dismantling Syria's chemical stockpile, but Jagland denied that the development had anything to do with his committee's decision. ""Actually we decided this before what happened in Syria this summer,"" he said. ""We awarded this organization because of what the organization has done."" ""But of course,"" he added, ""it's very important also now to give a kind of moral support to what it is going to do in Syria."" OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu was ""pleasantly surprised"" by the award. He hopes the prize will inspire people to go beyond the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. Uzumcu would like to see peace in Syria. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Mick Krever contributed to this report .","Weapons inspectors are taking the world closer to peace in the middle of a raging war .

"Boston (CNN) -- A federal jury on Tuesday heard the voice of reputed Boston mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger in conversations recorded during visits by his family members since his incarceration in 2011. Bulger, who had only been heard uttering choice expletives and inappropriate laughter during trial so far, can be heard imitating a machine gun while describing the death of a Dorchester bartender, who he is charged with killing along with 18 others. ""Bull Dog's was uh -- Eddie Connors ... the guy in the phone booth ... pa pa pa pa pow,"" Bulger says, laughing with his niece and nephew, the son and daughter of his brother William Bulger, who was president of the Massachusetts State Senate for 17 years. Prosecutors allege Bulger killed Connors in a phone booth in 1975 for running his mouth about Bulger and his ""Winter Hill Gang"" killing another Charlestown gangster. Whitey Bulger: Fast Facts . Karen Smith, who testified earlier about the last time she saw Connors, her father -- who she said used to come home for dinner and put her and her brother to bed every night -- was sobbing in her seat in the courtroom when the audio was played. Bulger did not implicate himself as the killer in the partially transcribed phone conversation of a visit on October 13, 2012. He said, ""They threw my name in the mix,"" likely referring to others placing the blame on him. ""As usual,"" his nephew responded. ""But that is what happened,"" Bulger said to his niece and nephew. In another audio recording, Bulger described a run-in with potential robbers at the liquor store he and his partners allegedly used as an ""office."" ""So I picked up a shotgun and I'm aimin' it at them and the guy looked up and oh...,"" Bulger said to his brother John Bulger. ""And I put one in the chamber like, ptwwww -- and he looked up and I'm aimin' and he says to the other guy, he says, 'Hey, (Bulger laughs) a bag of peanuts please.' "" ""We were lucky they didn't try to do nothing,"" Bulger told his brother during this December 11, 2012, visit. Bulger described as a 'hands-on killer' The prosecution has been trying to prove Bulger is guilty of 19 murder charges, as well as extortion, racketeering and money laundering. Bulger, 83, has pleaded not guilty. The trial entered its 15th day Tuesday, and will resume Monday after a long holiday weekend. The prosecution has called more than 30 witnesses and could call as many as 80 before the defense is given an opportunity to make its case. Judge Denise Casper advised jurors on Tuesday that court is likely to go into September. William ""Billy"" Shea was also called to the stand. Shea said he sold drugs for Bulger and gave him a ""chop,"" or piece of the profit, during the reign of Bulger's South Boston empire, which prosecutor's say lasted nearly 20 years. Shea also described how he and Bulger cultivated a friendship and a business together, often pointing to ""Jim,"" and referring to him during his storytelling, as if they were telling it together. Why we can't get enough of the gangster life . At one point, Shea was asked to describe how much money he was making at the height of his drug selling, when he was paying Bulger a cut of $4,000 a week. ""It was brisk, a good weekly take. I would say plus 100-thousand or more every week. I'm thinking Jim's looking at me saying this son of a bitch got that much money and I only got that end ... I don't know!"" Bulger laughed, as did the courtroom. Shea said he sold ""gangster"" weed and later partnered with Joseph Tower to sell cocaine. The jury, and the courtroom, appeared captivated by his storytelling. When Shea was asked to identify Bulger, he pointed at him and said, ""He is that young fella right there,"" and Bulger returned his old friend's smile. Shea, like the other associates, painted Bulger as their insurance, the ""protection"" they needed to do business and not be bothered. Both Tower and Shea have testified that Bulger helped them when they most needed it. Tower said Bulger saved his brother's life. Tower said Tuesday, ""Bulger was well known and well feared -- If you were with Mr. Bulger you could operate, you didn't need the police."" Both Shea and Tower are testifying under immunity agreements with the federal government. Shea told the jury that Bulger got upset with him when Shea indicated he wanted to leave the business. When Shea said he began reconciling with his old friend, it was as if no one was in the courtroom but the two of them. ""It was the first time you ever threatened me. I am sure you remember it. I do. You said, 'You remember what happened to Bucky Barrett?' I understood it to be what it meant. Bucky Barrett is someone who is missing. I took it as a threat,"" Shea said to Bulger, who was sitting no more than five feet in front of him. Bulger is charged with the murder of Arthur ""Bucky"" Barrett after allegedly shaking him down for money after a bank robbery. Then it seemed Shea remembered he was in court and said, ""It changed my perception of Jim just like that. I am looking at a guy who I thought I knew for many years, and he is saying you will do what I say or I'll whack you, basically."" Shea said shortly after that, Bulger and his associates picked Shea up and took him to the South Boston projects, where Bulger led him into a cellar to ""frighten me or whack me."" Shea said Bulger just wanted to talk about ""trust."" Shea said he had his back to the concrete on the lookout for the associates, who he thought were going to come down the steps to the cellar and ""make"" him. Shea said Bulger was also questioning him about ""skimming"" the drugs to set up a side business, but Shea said he ""hadn't seen the product in years,"" adding ""that's what Jim taught me, to always have buffers."" Shea said about Bulger, ""I have always feared him a little bit because I know he's smart and clever. I am thinking if he makes a move..."" and then Shea looked at Bulger. ""You make a move, you are going with me, Jim. That's what was going through my head."" Shea said Bulger didn't want any loose ends, and Shea assured him he didn't rat out Bulger when he was arrested in 1983 on drug trafficking charges, and he wasn't going to do it once he backed out of the business. The men finished their conversation and Bulger offered Shea a ride home, but Shea opted to walk, he said. Shea was with his 4-year-old son when he bumped into Bulger on a snowy night a month later. Shea said Bulger immediately told him, ""Bill, we are just here by chance,"" in an effort to ease his nerves. Shea said he hadn't seen Bulger since then until Tuesday.","Recordings of James ""Whitey"" Bulger's jail visits are played in court .

"(CNN) -- A New York-bound plane left Madrid-Barajas Airport in Spain only to return, where it ran off the runway but did not crash, an airport spokesman said. There are no reported injuries. The pilot of Delta flight 415, which was headed to JFK International, reported to the control tower there was a mechanical problem with the Boeing jet and requested to return to the airport. The plane is on a taxiway being inspected and repaired. Spanish newspaper El Pais reported the problem was related to the hydraulic system. Delta Air Lines issued a statement saying the plane turned around ""for precautionary reasons."" ""The flight landed normally and the passengers deplaned normally,"" it said. Asked whether the plane went off the runway, a Delta spokeswoman said she couldn't comment beyond the statement. The airline has put most, if not all, of the passengers in hotels, she said.","Delta flight 415 returned to Madrid shortly after takeoff; no injuries reported .

"(CNN) -- What do Bruce Willis, Winston Churchill, Marilyn Monroe and King George VI have in common besides being public figures? They all suffered from stuttering at some point in their lives. But what is stuttering and how it does it manifest itself? The Stuttering Foundation of America explains on its website that it is ""a communication disorder in which the flow of speech is broken by repetitions, prolongations, or abnormal stoppages of sounds and syllables."" In February 2010, a group of researchers published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, which states that the brain cells of people who stutter have three genetic mutations; this causes problems in the cells' metabolism. ""This process is called the garbage can, or more like the recycling bin, of the cell. When this process gets interrupted, the cell goes haywire, and that causes problems,"" the study's co-author Dennis Drayna told CNN. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, 1% of the world's population, around 68 million people, stutter. One of them is Sophie Gustafson, a Swedish golfer who has been professional for 18 years, winning 28 titles on the most prestigious tours and earning over $6.3 million, proving that stuttering is not an impediment to succeed. During September's Solheim Cup, a biennial international match played between a U.S. and a European team, Gustafson wrote on her official blog: ""I decided to leave my comfort zone and give my first TV interview."" Gustafson decided to speak to the Golf Channel. The editing team worked for two hours on the 70 minutes it took her to answer nine questions. The result? A three-and-a-half-minute interview. The 37-year-old told CNNMÃ©xico: ""With help from people with good hearts and a little patience maybe a stutterers story can get out there. ""I've always had it, ever since I first started speaking. Both my older brothers had it too, but by the time they started school it disappeared. Unfortunately I wasn't that lucky."" Nonetheless, she had unconditional support from four boys who attended the same school as her, a quartet Gustafson describes as ""the cool kids."" She also explained how sports were key to her development. ""I was very good at all sports growing up and I think that played a huge part. I always played with the boys and I was always the first one to get picked for any team."" In first grade she began speech therapy in the school's facilities, but far from helping it increased her feelings of isolation. ""it just made me feel singled out and enlighten my problem, that I didn't really see as being much of a problem,"" Gustafson said. ""We really didn't do much; we played different games, probably some that made me say or repeat different words."" Eventually Gustafson left therapy, spending her high school years focusing on her game. She was not the best amateur and could only make it into the 'B' team, but the real challenge came when she had to make new friends. ""Because of my stutter I tend to go where it's safe and people know me, I don't venture out and try to meet new people unless it's forced upon me.,"" she said. Gustafson decided to give speech therapy another shot, commiting to twice-weekly sessions with her therapist for six months. ""She was really good and I think it helped me,"" she reflected. ""But it's too hard for me to translate what I learned into real life."" Gustafson couldn't leave stuttering behind, but she clung to golf, and in 1994 the Swede got her Ladies European Tour (LET) membership. This new professional opportunity forced her to once again meet new people, so she sought help from her family. ""I had my brother out with me the first summer so he kind of got me going,"" she recalled. ""He is a very social and all around great guy so I just tagged along with him... I had my dad helping me with flights, booking them over the phone."" By 1998, Gustafson had won three times on the LET and received the Player of the Year award once. It was time to join the world's largest and most dominant women's Tour, the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA). Three LPGA titles and four years later, she decided to try another treatment at the Hollins Communications Research Institute in Virginia, founded in 1972 to investigate stuttering with scientific methods and new treatment approaches. ""That was a three-week intensive course which was very good, but again, back in real life, I had a very difficult time using what I learned."" None of the treatments she tried in different stages of her life worked. So when she won the Chick-fil-A Charity Championship, she asked someone else do gave the winner's speech for her. ""I would've loved to have made the thank you speech instead of having Nancy Lopez do it for me, but because of my stuttering it would've been Monday by the time I finished,"" she wrote in a Sports Illustrated article. Gustafson's impediment is severe, but she still feels fortunate to have achieved all she has within golf. ""The best thing is to have been lucky enough to go where I've gone,"" Gustafson said. ""It's important not to care what people think and just do what you want to do. If they have a problem with that, that is exactly that, their problem.""","Sophie Gustafson is a Swedish golfer who has struggled with stuttering all her life .

"(CNN) -- Matthew Fox is off the hook for an early morning incident last month after which a party-bus driver accused him of assault, according to the spokeswoman for the Cleveland, Ohio, mayor. ""After a thorough review of the facts, the Prosecutor's Office has decided not to charge,"" Andrea Taylor said Friday. Heather Bormann, 29, filed a complaint against Matthew Fox on August 30, two days after the ""Lost"" actor allegedly punched her repeatedly in an incident outside a Cleveland nightclub. ""He got me pretty good,"" Bormann told CNN as she described the fight with Fox. Representatives for Fox, who was in Cleveland to film a movie, never responded to repeated CNN calls for comment on the allegations. ""He was swinging at my legs and, ultimately, my chest and my crotch area,"" Bormann said in an interview. She suffered a wrist injury when she punched him back, Bormann said. The fight started when Fox tried to board her bus, which had been rented for a bachelor party that he was not part of, Bormann said. Fox had one leg in the bus and one leg on the ground when she warned him to step off, which he refused, she said. That's when he started throwing punches at her, she said. ""He reeked of liquor,"" Bormann said. ""You could just smell it coming off of him. He had glassy eyes and a blank stare the whole time.""","""The Prosecutor's Office has decided not to charge,"" spokeswoman for Cleveland mayor says .

"(CNN) -- It's New Year's Day 2013. I can feel the wind on my face. My heart rate is steady, but I'm so full of joy and pride it may beat out of my chest. I can hear my friends yelling from the sidelines: ""You did it! We're so proud of you!"" I try to choke back tears. My knees buckle as 14 people surround me. I have just finished my first 5K race. But wait -- something is missing. My two best friends are nowhere to be seen. ""Your relationships will change."" I heard that piece of advice more than any other during the Fit Nation kickoff weekend. I think about those four words often. Finding fitness that works for you . I was always someone a friend could call at a moment's notice to go out. When I finally decided to get healthy, I couldn't continue to do that. I made a conscious decision to change where I hung out, who I hung out with and what we did when we were hanging out. The majority of my friends are health-conscious, so I didn't think any of my relationships would change much. I was wrong. Going out to eat is a rare occasion these days, and I can't remember the last time I had a drink. All of my free time is spent at the gym or doing something active. To maintain my active lifestyle I make sure I get a minimum of seven hours of sleep every night. Most of my friends are going out when I'm going to bed. I knew my best friends and I hadn't seen each other in a while, but in all the years we've known each other, we had never missed the ""big stuff."" That morning, after my first race, I checked my phone. There were messages from both of them telling me how proud they were, but that New Year's Eve had gotten the best of them. Later, I explained how hurt I was that they weren't there. I found out they were hurt, too. They felt like they didn't ""fit into"" my life anymore. We had always spent time together seeing the latest movie, checking out a new restaurant or going to a concert. Vanderbilt basketball games were our favorite, but most of those games were at 8 p.m. Thursdays and I was in bed. The Annette they knew and loved was changing. Work out your mind first . It was hard to hear. But we talked it out and -- because we're women -- we had a really good cry. Any time there is a new challenge in your life, be prepared for your relationships to change. Your friendships will change; your family life will change. And don't be surprised when the most significant change is your relationship with yourself. I thought the absence of certain people in my life was temporary. It's not. The changes I've made and continue to make are permanent lifestyle investments in me and my ultimate goal of living the rest of my life as a healthy, happy, active adult. I've made new friends since the beginning of my journey. I'm a social person so I'm always going to have a group around. Some of that group has changed because I needed it to, but those who matter have weathered the changes with me and will always have my back no matter where life takes us. Get fit and others will follow . My friends and I still don't see each other as often as we did, and probably never will. But we check in on each other and have made a promise to hang out at least once a month. When I cross the finish line of my first half-marathon on April 27, I know both of them will be there with smiles on their faces, arms open wide and pride in their hearts for whom I'm becoming.

"(CNN) -- Martha* had decided to undergo a breast augmentation. She researched doctors and found one she thought was well-qualified; ads in magazines touted him as board-certified and a top plastic surgeon in the area. Martha met with him for a consultation and underwent the procedure in his office several weeks later. But at home that night, she discovered a shocking sight: . Her breast implants were lodged in her armpits. The next morning, she rushed back to her doctor's office. He inspected her chest and, with a quizzical look on his face, declared, ""I have never seen this before."" Martha decided to seek another opinion. A new surgeon explained that the previous physician had botched the procedure. She would need extensive surgery to correct it. As if this weren't bad enough, he also informed her that her doctor wasn't what he claimed to be. Sure, he was board-certified -- just not in plastic surgery. Her ""plastic surgeon"" was actually an eye doctor. Stories like Martha's are becoming more and more common across the United States. Plastic surgery has become the Wild West of medicine, with an increasing number of doctors performing invasive cosmetic procedures without proper training or credentials. In my metro Detroit practice alone, I've been horrified by dozens of botched jobs. One of my patients, a beautiful 25-year-old woman, was left with shark bite-sized divots all over her thighs and stomach after undergoing laser liposuction by a family medicine doctor. A local ENT (ear nose and throat) physician took $12,000 from a young hairdresser for two unnecessary operations: insertion of watermelon-sized breast implants and liposuction to her abdomen. The implants were eventually removed, and the liposuction left her tummy a rippled, lumpy mess. Why does this happen? Although state medical boards regulate who can obtain a license to practice medicine, they don't restrict doctors from performing procedures outside of their training or specialty. Once they are licensed, there is no law against doctors performing any medical procedure they want to, as long as the patient consents to it. As a board-certified plastic surgeon, I can legally perform a knee replacement or hysterectomy, procedures for which I am completely unqualified. This lack of regulation has allowed an increasing number of doctors of all types -- including gynecologists, general surgeons and even emergency medicine physicians -- to perform tummy tucks, liposuction, facelifts and breast enhancement. These procedures are almost never performed in real hospitals. Hospitals typically vet their surgeons and allow them to practice only within their field of training and expertise. Doctors get around this by performing cosmetic procedures in their own in-office operating rooms or at ambulatory surgery centers, where the credentialing requirements may not be as strict. So why do so many doctors reject their chosen specialty and remake themselves as plastic surgeons? One word: money. Declining physician reimbursement has resulted in more physicians looking for ways to enhance their income. And plastic surgery is one of the only fields of medicine that is shielded from insurance companies. So an increasing number of doctors are closing their traditional medical practices and opening cosmetic surgery centers. These physicians learn the basics of plastic surgery through weekend courses, shadowing other doctors and even online webinars. This influx of poorly trained cosmetic surgeons has caused Martha's story to become just one of many. If you are considering having plastic surgery, I implore you: Do your homework. Find a plastic surgeon who is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, the only plastic surgery board that is recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties. For facial plastic surgery, a doctor certified by the American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery is considered an equivalent in all states. I consider it a privilege that my patients put their lives and bodies in my hands. All surgeons should. In return, we have a moral obligation to only perform procedures that we are fully qualified to do. No matter how well it pays. *Patients' names and identifying details have been changed to protect their privacy.

"(CNN) -- ""I met him (Lance Armstrong) once at a party,"" Charlie Sheen told Piers Morgan, ""and I'm assuming he was in a bad mood, because he wasn't the friendliest guy in the world."" The Hollywood veteran spoke candidly to the CNN host about Lance Armstrong, Lindsay Lohan, battles with ""Two and a Half Men"" executive producer Chuck Lorre, fatherhood, becoming a grandfather, toning down his bad boy ways, and more. ""He was rude to you?"" asked Morgan. ""Yes. I'm sure people have said that about me from time to time; not too often, though, because I'm pretty approachable."" Sheen recalled that the encounter occurred about five or six years ago. ""I said, 'Mr. Armstrong, I'm sorry to bother you.' I think he was talking to Sheryl Crow. And I said 'I'm Charlie Sheen. I just want to shake your hand.' And he said 'That's nice.'"" Morgan asked Sheen what he thought about Armstrong's doping admission, and Sheen opened up about his own struggles with drug use and public image. ""The reason I've been forgiven for a lot of my stuff,"" said Sheen, ""is because there's always been a feeling of honesty and the guy that at least was trying to do the right thing."" Decades ago, Sheen admitted that he took steroids back in 1988 when he was working on the film ""Major League."" ""They worked. And I stopped,"" said Sheen, who noted the steroids' adverse affects. ""It made me crazy. It made me insane and angry and picking fights in bars, you know. So I get it. But it also gave me, in the final couple of weeks of the shooting, the energy I needed to keep going."" Sheen did say that steroids did not allow him to hit a baseball any better. ""It may give you extra legs deep in the season, but you still have to have that God-given ability to hit the ball,"" he said. A self-professed ""baseball player at heart,"" Sheen admitted to Morgan that his dream career would be to play for the Cincinnati Reds. ""I don't know that I had the skills to play professionally,"" admitted Sheen. ""I probably would have been riding a bus in Duluth until I was like 35."" Sheen has not spoken to Chuck Lorre since he was very publicly fired by the ""Two and a Half Men"" executive producer. ""I think we were in the same hotel lobby one night and missed each other by about 10 minutes,"" said the actor. ""What would you have said if you had bumped into him?"" asked Morgan. ""I'd have walked right up to him and said 'Hey man, good luck with everything. Sorry about that and see you on campus.'"" Sheen replied. 'Anger Management' gets 90-episode renewal . However, Sheen noted that ""the fantasy is walking up and dropping him, but that's not who I am. It's not who I am. You know, I'm not a violent guy."" ""Do you harbor resentment toward him?"" asked Morgan. ""I just wish that he would acknowledge, at some point, that he had a hand in it. He did put out a statement. The timing was perfect for him, actually, because nothing is organic. It's always a little bit manufactured."" Sheen also admitted that there are ""parts"" of Lorre that he misses. ""When I look back at the pilot of 'Two and a Half,' it was an absolute gem. And I almost agreed to do that show based on his enthusiasm and his track record without seeing a script. And what I said to him, 'What are you going to call it?' And when he said, ""Two and a Half Men,"" I knew it was a hit."" Sheen's opinion on the show, post his own departure, has changed. ""They downloaded their anchor,"" he said. ""They cut off their anchor and they went adrift. And I think you don't realize how important your anchor is until you don't have it, you know."" Morgan asked Sheen to elaborate on how he feels about his ""Two and a Half Men"" replacement, Ashton Kutcher. ""He's a terrific young man and he's doing a great job with what they've given him ... he should be really grateful... "" Sheen did laud his former co-star Jon Cryer's comedic skills, however, calling the Emmy winning actor ""a genius."" Sheen also set the record straight on the $100,000 he gave to Lindsay Lohan. The pair were set to work together on ""Scary Movie 5"" and, according to Sheen, producers gave Lohan $100,000 less than what he thought she was going to be paid, so the actor simply made up the difference. ""And was she grateful?"" asked Morgan. ""Eventually, yes, absolutely. She was. Yes... It wasn't like right off the bat, though."" Morgan noted that Lohan similarly underwent a pattern of drug and alcohol abuse not unlike Sheen's. ""Can you actually, even you, give somebody like that advice?"" asked Morgan. ""Or is it, in the end, the look in the mirror and work it out for yourself?"" ""If she'd asked me questions about some of my own stuff,"" said Sheen, ""I would have gladly given her advice but she didn't. And I found that interesting. Maybe she didn't want to bother me or didn't want to pry."" Sheen expanded on the demons associated with fame, drugs and excess. ""It's a similar garment that we're all wearing, yes,"" he said. ""I think fame has a lot to do with it and I think excess has a lot to do with it... not so much excess but access -- access to anything with a phone call at any point, day or night, it doesn't matter... It can become a nightmare ... At first ... it's radical and it's everything that you thought it was going to be ... and then it's not. And that turns on a dime. And suddenly there's an emptiness."" Sheen, 47, who has largely toned down his hard-partying ways, will become a grandfather this year. His 28-year-old daughter from a previous relationship is due to give birth in September. ""I knew it was going to happen eventually,"" said Sheen, ""... but I didn't know it would be this soon and it's none of my business when she chose to do that, you know. So I've just got to be along for the ride and celebrating and just cheering her along and giving her whatever she needs."" Sheen had four other children: Two girls with ex-wife Denise Richards and twin boys with ex-wife Brooke Mueller. ""I put everybody in my neighborhood, which is my ultimate master plan,"" said Sheen. ""I put Denise and the girls in one house, Brooke and the boys in the other, and we're all behind the same gate."" Sheen said his ex-wives get along great and babysit one another's children. ""It is pretty civilized,"" he said. ""We just keep everybody paid and they'll be happy."" Morgan asked Sheen what bit of advice he would pass along to his two sons. ""Lead with the truth,"" said Sheen. ""That's what I've always done. That's what my dad told me."" Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- Rising from the desert like a white Arabian castle, Umm Qarn has all the trimmings you'd expect of a six-star luxury hotel. Walk through the grand marble entrance, replete with chandelier, and you'll find a fitness studio, swimming pool, solarium and international restaurant. But behind the gold-plated doors, a team of fitness gurus from across the world is catering to an unlikely guest. Welcome to Qatar's Umm Qarn Stud Farm, the breeding ground of some of the most successful -- and expensive -- race horses on the planet. Owned by the Gulf state's former prime minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Khalifa Al Thani, the 580-acre estate is home to about 60 champion horses -- either in training for their next million-dollar competition or being used to breed a new generation of winners. One of those champions, Arabian stallion Tabarak, this week won Qatar's most prestigious race, the Emir's Sword, extending his unbeaten winning streak to a remarkable six. His silver sword trophy -- not to mention $550,000 in prize money -- will now join the many others already lining Umm Qarn's lavish lobby. Behind Tabarak's success -- and that of his predecessor Al Dahma, who won the sword in 2009 and 2010 -- is an international team of trainers, nutritionists and scientists reinventing the way that champion stallions are raised. ""I don't think you could find facilities like that in Europe,"" says Umm Qarn's head trainer, Alban de Mieulle, pointing to the farm's swimming pool, treadmill and solarium. With temperatures in Qatar soaring to 113F (45C), the pool is an ideal place for sleek stallions to cool down after a morning workout. The water itself is kept at a comfortable 68F (20C), in an air-conditioned room. ""The horses go in for one or two minutes,"" De Mieulle says. ""You have good and bad swimmers, but we never push them if they don't want to go. And 95% of them really love swimming."" The extreme desert weather means temperatures can also drop to 41F (5C) in winter. But instead of shivering in the paddocks, the pampered ponies are treated to a solarium session. ""We use the solarium after swimming. Sometimes the weather can drop to -5C (23F) in the morning, so we use it to dry the horses,"" De Mieulle explains. ""Some of them have back problems and, because the lights are around 24C (75F), it's good for them."" When not relaxing in front of the solarium, the horses -- a mixture of Arabian stallions and thoroughbreds -- can enjoy a nutritious meal of hay imported from France and fresh alfalfa grown in the garden. When Frenchman De Mieulle first arrived at Umm Qarn (""The Place"") seven years ago, he was astonished to find a thriving farm housing not just horses, but cows and gazelles. But it can be hard work creating a green oasis in the desert, with track specialists importing grass seeds from the U.S. during the winter and turf from Bermuda during the summer. ""The main challenge here is actually growing the grass. We don't have rain, the climatic conditions are very harsh, and there is a lot of salt in the water so we always have high PH levels,"" says Qatar Racing and Equestrian Club track manager Bradford Smith. ""We also have a lot of funguses and diseases -- our track could be in perfect condition one day and the next morning all of a sudden it's brown."" It may seem like an exhausting amount of resources plowed into keeping horses happy. But this is Qatar, an oil-rich emirate which has invested heavily in its racing industry -- and its brand abroad -- in the last decade. In 2008, the Qatar Racing and Equestrian Club became the official sponsor of France's prestigious Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe -- the richest turf race in Europe, which attracts a TV audience of around 1 billion. Last year the Qatar royal family's private investment company, Qipco, also bought the naming rights for the British Champion Series, which includes premier races the Derby, the St. Leger, the Guineas and the Oaks, in a multimillion-pound deal. ""We are trying our best to be one of the top horse racing industries in the world, we're trying our best to be an icon,"" said Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, son of the Emir of Qatar. ""We're not looking to be the greatest -- we've got our own style and we've our own guidelines to work with. But hopefully we'd like to be one of the main race tracks in the world."" If the horses are anything to go by, a day out at the races in Qatar is sure to be a luxurious experience.","Six-star luxury hotel features pool, solarium, and an unlikely guest .

"Washington (CNN) -- ""I cannot tell you that I am an innocent man. I am not asking you to feel sorry for me, and I won't hide the truth,"" Mark Anthony Stroman said from Texas death row at the Polunsky Correctional Unit in Livingston. ""I am a human being and made a terrible mistake out of love, grief and anger, and believe me, I am paying for it every single minute of the day."" The 41-year-old prisoner is scheduled to be executed Wednesday for a murder he once said was fueled by ""patriotism,"" but which the state argued was motivated by pure hatred. The admitted white supremacist was convicted in the deadly shooting of an Indian man, part of a killing spree that began just after the September 11 terror attacks. His target: those he believed were of Middle Eastern background, in revenge and retaliation for the worst domestic terror incident in U.S. history. A Pakistani man was also murdered and a Bangladeshi man was seriously wounded in separate attacks. The Supreme Court denied a stay of execution last month. Stroman's supporters are urging the governor and the state Board of Pardons and Parole to grant clemency. Stroman says he was sitting at home, watching the 9/11 attacks unfold on television. He claims his sister was in the top floors of the World Trade Center's North Tower when it and the adjacent South Tower collapsed from the deliberate crash of jetliners into the building. That claim was never substantiated during his felony murder trial and was not raised by his current appellate attorney as a reason for his subsequent acts. In a recent posting on his prison blog, Stroman says the terror attacks sparked something inside him. ""Let's just say that I could not think clearly anymore and I am sorry to say I made innocent people pay for my rage, anger, grief and loss,"" he wrote. Citing his own statements to fellow inmates, a federal appeals court, in denying his claims, concluded that Stroman believed that the U.S. government ""hadn't done their job, so he was going to do it for them"" by retaliating. The man told his lawyers he once belonged to the Aryan Brotherhood, a white supremacist prison gang, and has a long criminal history of burglary, armed robbery and theft. Just days after the horrifying incidents in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania a decade ago, prosecutors said, Stroman began carefully plotting what he believed was revenge. He was on bail at the time for previous crimes. On September 15, he shot Waqar Hasan in the head while the man was grilling hamburgers in his convenience store. The 46-year-old Pakistani native had moved to the Dallas area only that year to start a new life with his family. Six days later, Stroman shot Raisuddin Bhuiyan in the face while he manned the counter at a gas station. He survived but was left blind in one eye. Then, on October 4, Stroman attempted to rob the Mesquite gas station operated by Vasudev Patel. Surveillance tapes showed the suspect waving a .44-caliber chrome-plated pistol at the clerk and demanding, ""Open the register or I'll kill you."" The 49-year-old Patel tried to reach for his gun hidden under the counter, but Stroman shot the unarmed man in the chest. The killer left without taking any cash. He was arrested the next day. Patel was a Hindu, not Muslim, Arab or Middle Eastern. It was for that crime that Stroman was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to death. During the sentencing phase, he made an obscene hand gesture to Hasan's relatives. Although he now claims remorse for his actions, a year after the killings, Stroman was in a different mood. Writing on his blog, he said, ""This was not a crime of hate but an act of Passion and Patriotism, an act of country and commitment, an act of retribution and recompense. The was not done during Peace time but at War time. I, Mark Anthony Stroman, felt a need to exact some measure of equality and fairness for the thousands of victims of September 11th, 2001, for the United States of America and its people, The People of this Great Country. GOD BLESS AMERICA."" One of Stroman's biggest supporters is the man who survived his ordeal and testified against the defendant. Rais Bhuiyan is a devout Muslim who came to the United States to pursue his education. A decade ago, he was about to be married and was working an extra job. He says a large ""angry"" man wearing a bandana, sunglasses and a baseball cap approached him in the store and asked, ""Where are you from?"" Confused, Bhuiyan asked, ""Excuse me?"" Immediately afterward, he remembered being shot, ""the sensation of a million bees stinging my face, and then heard an explosion."" Bhuiyan believes that his attacker does not deserve to die and has created a website, worldwithouthate.org, to urge Texas to spare Stroman's life. ""In order to live in a better and peaceful world, we need to break the cycle of hate and violence. I believe forgiveness is the best policy, which helps to break this cycle,"" he said, calling himself a victim of a hate crime. ""I forgave Mark Stroman many years ago. I believe he was ignorant and not capable of distinguishing between right and wrong. Otherwise he wouldn't have done what he did."" Bhuiyan traveled this month to Paris to urge the European Parliament to step in and file a formal request for Texas to commute Stroman's sentence to life in prison. European leaders, as well as the United Nations, had condemned the July 7 execution of a Mexican national on Texas death row. Humberto Leal Garcia Jr. had been denied access to his consulate upon arrest in 1994, which his supporters said was a violation of an international treaty that deserved a new hearing into Leal's capital conviction. Bhuiyan is also working with Amnesty International and Stroman's attorneys to at least delay the lethal injection. The Bangladeshi man cites his Muslim faith, saying he has received the blessing of the dead men's families. And he wants to meet his attacker on death row before it is too late. ""His attorney gave him the message that one of your victims is running this campaign to save your life,"" he said. ""He was reduced to tears. He couldn't believe one of his victims would come forward and try to save his life."" Stroman says his biggest regret is that he would leave his four children behind and says that being a capital inmate is a ""nightmare come to life."" Prisoner No. 999-409 also claims to be a changed man. ""I am sorry to say I made innocent people pay for my rage, anger, grief and loss,"" he said. ""I have destroyed my victims' families as well as my own. Out of pure anger and stupidity I did some things to some men from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia. And now I sit on death row awaiting execution. And by no means am I proud of what I have done."" Lawyer Lydia Brandt says her client was ""in a paranoid, delusional state"" at the time of the murders and ""shot these individuals believing they were Arab, enemies of the United States."" She offered expert mental health evidence in support of this claim. The state sees it differently, noting that the six children of the men Stroman murdered in cold blood will grow up without their father. The victims also left their wives as widows. Officials cite testimony by fellow inmates of Stroman's continuing dangerousness and his unrepentant racist views, both pre- and post-conviction. Barring a last-minute intervention, Stroman will die for his crimes. The Supreme Court appeal is Stroman v. Thaler (10-9873).","Mark Stroman is set to die for 2001 murder of Indian man .

"Singapore (CNN) -- It is early evening at the Isthana restaurant in Singapore's Little India and migrant workers are streaming in. Some pay for their curries and packets of rice, while others come for a free food program run by an NGO called The Cuff Road Project. Many of these men -- mainly from Bangladesh and India -- have no work and little or no money. But they have no shortage of sad stories to tell. Back in his hometown in southeast Bangladesh, Amran longed to work in Singapore. So the 23-year old with a ready smile borrowed money wherever he could - some from relatives and some from a neighbor who charged interest. He scraped together the US$7,000 demanded by an agent in Bangladesh to secure a construction job and work permit. Only nine months into his job in concrete assembly, Amran fell and broke his leg so badly that bones protruded through his skin. Though his doctor urged his employer to keep him in the hospital, Amran says he was sent back to the worker's dormitory after a week with a metal plate and 60 screws inserted into his leg. Back in the dormitory Amran was left to fend for himself with a supply of pills and his food supplied by friends. He's healed now but left with a limp and a large debt. Singapore's reputation for being stable and business-friendly has fueled this tiny nation's rapid development. To keep this engine of growth running, Singapore says it needs migrant workers. Of the more than one million foreign workers in Singapore, the majority are workers like Amran, filling the ranks in the country's booming construction and shipyard operations. ""I've gone places with workers and they will suddenly point up to the skyline and say 'I built that building.'"" said Debbie Fordyce, who runs the Cuff Road Project. It serves thousands of meals every month to migrant workers who have filed claims for salary or injury compensation through Singapore's Ministry of Manpower. In recent years Singapore has beefed up its labor regulations, and some see an evolution during the past decade. ""I think there is now a greater awareness and sensitivity towards the rights and concerns of these work permit holders,"" said Eugene Tan at Singapore Management University's School of Law. But critics say there is more to be done in tackling unscrupulous employers. Construction worker Manik sold his land and borrowed from a neighbor to pay his agent's $5,000 fee. ""In Bangladesh, very poor, everybody coming must sell land, cow, something,"" he explained. He never believed he'd be worse off. One day he fell in a manhole while pulling optical cables but got little sympathy or help. ""If you try to take a day off, foreman say, 'boss cut your permit and send you back,'"" Manik recalled. When his injury didn't heal, his boss told him to drop his request for further medical help or be sent back home. Manik showed two burns on his hand he claimed were inflicted by the lit cigarette of his angry boss. He says his mother has a heart condition and can't tell his mother about his problems. ""I tell her I am happy,"" he says. Whatever the outcome of his case, Manik wants to get another job here. ""Singapore so much money, so we come, we want to make our future,"" he said. Companies in Singapore must carry insurance for their workers and are expected to pay medical costs. But advocates say injuries can be kept under the government radar by minimizing medical care days even for major injuries. A spokesman for Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), a migrant welfare center said, ""There are cases where they have been locked up or sent to outpatient for serious injury."" A 2010 report by a coalition of Singaporean charities alleges evidence needed to pursue claims is often missing or concealed by employers. The Singapore Contractors Association, many of whose members are the targets of workers' complaints, says it doesn't track abuses and that it is up to the worker to "" take on the employer themselves"" with the help of the government or a lawyer. ""It all comes down to the government's attitude towards workers and labor. This has always been a pro-business and pro-employer government. This is why the laws are not strong enough to provide protection,"" said Jolovan Wham of HOME, a migrant advocacy group. Stories abound among workers of ""gangsters"" hired to threaten anyone who tries to bring a claim against their employer - or kidnap workers from the company dorms or off the streets to send them home when they can no longer work. The government does not give statistics, but both the Government and advocates offer advice on what to do if being forcefully repatriated. Shagar, a tall worker from Bangladesh, hurt his leg while carrying heavy floor tiling. While pursuing compensation, he was invited for a coffee with his foreman one day at the worker's dormitory. When he got there he was confronted by two ""large Indian men"" who demanded his work permit and dormitory pass. He said one man told him, ""Don't waste your time, you go your room, take your baggage and come with me."" He described being taken to an office belonging to a business that specialized in repatriating workers. Two other workers already being held there were crying. Shagar was told he would be put on a plane back to Bangladesh that night. What saved him, he said, were his hidden cell phone and the number of a lawyer's assistant he had memorized. Ravi, a brawny man wearing a heavy gold neck chain, is the owner of the UTR ""repatriation"" company. He calmly denies his men are gangsters who used force. He explained that his company is called in when a company fears the worker may sabotage the job or fail a medical. ""The employer hires us to take them back to the airport,"" he said. According to Ravi, companies pay $250 per worker and in the space of six hours his two-man team can close the worker's company bank account, collect his belongings and get him to the airport. He says he handles about 20 cases a month, and it is ""very rare"" when a worker refuses to go back. When a worker is ""missing"" in Singapore, Ravi's company searches for them, charging around $1,000 dollars a head -- cost effective for companies that stand to lose the government-mandated S$5,000 security bond per worker. He calls it ""a completely different operation"" but won't elaborate. The government says repatriation companies are needed for travel arrangements, while the Singapore Contractor's Association insists they are necessary to prevent workers from absconding before they get through immigration. But a Government ministry spokesman conceded that the system is open to abuse. ""Some employers engage repatriation companies to avoid payment of salaries or other legitimate claims by the workers such as injury compensation,"" he said. The costs of obtaining work in Singapore also make it difficult for migrant workers to make a decent living. According to one Singapore NGO, as much as 10 months of a worker's anticipated salary is paid in employment agency fees. ""At best for the majority of foreign workers, it is a way of making enough to survive,"" said a spokesperson for TWC2. The government has capped agents' fees inside Singapore, but the trail of money is hard to trace. Fees are paid up front in the worker's home country with little documentation. The 2011 U.S. Government ""Trafficking in Persons Report"" asserts agencies and employers in Singapore find ways to ""mask"" illegal fees. The report said ""exorbitant fees are sometimes the result of multiple layers of sub-contracting to smaller agencies and individual recruiters, commissions paid to Singaporean agencies."" In response the Singaporean government has questioned the credibility and methodology of the report. It says it investigates and prosecutes any abuse of repatriation procedures, but they investigated only two cases in 2010, no mention of prosecution. Some migrant workers are lured to Singapore by agents but then find there is no work for them. Kasshem, a small man with sad eyes, came from Bangladesh to work in a shipyard after his small store at home failed. A friend convinced him there was big money to be made. But when he arrived Kasshem said his company had little work. He then injured his back. Back in Bangladesh he is more than $7,000 in debt and expects little compensation though the government's settlement process. ""My life finished,"" he lamented. Singapore says it has increased demands for documentation from employers to prevent this type of abuse and says companies must now show proof they have ongoing projects before work passes are issued. Back at the repatriation office, Biplab, a 28-year-old former shipyard worker is waiting for his trip back to Bangladesh. Wide eyed and swallowing rapidly, he relaxes a bit when he understands a reporter wants to hear his story. Sitting alone, he readily admits he broke Singapore laws by seeking extra work outside the conditions of his labor permit. With no parents and five sisters to support, Biplab sold his house and land to pay his US$ 7,000 fee. But when he arrived in Singapore he said the company gave him 10 days of work for every 15 and only paid $5 day when he wasn't working. Some months he earned as little as $300. In broken English, he asked: ""After food money, how?"" Biplab took on side jobs such as apartment repairs for extra money. But he said he went willingly with Ravi's men and has not been mistreated. He said he will try to work in Singapore again. Singapore is certainly not Asia's worst offender in this area, but workers' advocates say much needs to be done to improve the situation. ""Given Singapore's wealth and resources, it is a shame that we cannot deal with these issues adequately,"" said Wham.","Singapore has reputation for stability and business-friendly climate .
It has more than a million foreign workers, fueling growth .
In recent years, Singapore has beefed up labor regulations .

"(CNN) -- Although the United States' preterm birth rate decreased for the sixth consecutive year, a new report gives the nation a ""C"" grade. The 2012 preterm birth rate dropped to 11.5%, a 15-year low, according to the March of Dimes Premature Birth Report Card. Preterm or premature births are defined as birth before 37 weeks of gestation. However, the report cautions, America's preterm birth rate remains the highest among industrialized countries. Preterm birth is the leading cause of newborn death, and babies who survive often face serious and sometimes lifelong health problems such as developmental delays or vision loss, according to the organization. ""A premature birth costs businesses about 12 times as much as uncomplicated healthy birth,"" March of Dimes President Dr. Jennifer L. Howse said in a statement. ""As a result, premature birth is a major driver of health insurance costs, not only for employers."" Fewer moms having C-sections before 39 weeks . The preterm birth rate peaked at 12.8% in 2006 after rising for more than two decades, according to the March of Dimes. The 2012 rate represents a 10% drop and the best rate since 1998. Compared with 2006, nearly all states had lower preterm birth rates in 2012. Thirty-one states, Washington and Puerto Rico all saw improvements. Six states -- Alaska, California, Oregon, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine -- received an ""A"" grade. Three states -- Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana -- received an ""F,"" along with Puerto Rico. The state with the lowest preterm birth rate was Vermont, with 8.7%. Mississippi was the highest, with 17.1%. But the March of Dimes said California's success is noteworthy, as the state sees half a million births each year -- the most of any state -- and ""has a racially diverse population in a mix of urban, suburban and rural communities that have a variety of healthcare and economic needs."" Infant deaths: Searching for answers in Mississippi . The organization compared birth rates with its goal of 9.6% by 2020. Contributing factors were also tracked. For instance, 37 states, along with Washington and Puerto Rico, reduced the percentage of uninsured women of childbearing age. Thirty-five states and Washington reduced the percentage of women of childbearing age who smoked, and 28 states, Washington and Puerto Rico lowered the rate of late preterm births: infants born between 34 and 36 weeks gestation.","The U.S.'s preterm birth rate is at a 15-year low .

"(CNN)  -- A woman who was inside a ""sweat lodge"" at an Arizona retreat where three people died this month described people vomiting and screaming. ""Everybody was throwing up everywhere. There was spitting going on. ... People were so disoriented they were screaming at one point,"" said Beverly Bunn of Texas. Three people died after spending time in the sweat lodge October 8 and nearly 20 others were injured. Two were pronounced dead shortly after they arrived at a local hospital and a third died October 17 after being hospitalized since the incident. Bunn described a scene of horror and confusion inside the dome-like structure, which was covered with tarps and blankets and had hot rocks and water inside to create steam. ""I saw all of these people lying around and mucus coming out of their nose and mouth and eyes rolled back in their heads."" There were as many as 65 visitors, ages 30 to 60, attending the program at the resort. They spent as long as two hours inside the sweat lodge. The self-help expert who ran the program said it has been a ""difficult"" period but that he will continue his schedule of events despite the deaths. James Arthur Ray, who ran the ""Spiritual Warrior"" program at the Angel Valley Retreat Center near Sedona, also addressed the families of those who died. ""I feel your pain. I accept your anger. And I pray for you all to have some measure of peace and comfort,"" Ray wrote Tuesday on his blog. ""I want you to know that I too want to know what happened that caused this horrible tragedy. My team and I are working with the appropriate authorities and have even hired our own investigators to find out the truth."" Yavapai County Sheriff Steve Waugh told reporters October 15 the sweat lodge was meant to be a ""spiritual awakening"" exercise for participants in the ""Spiritual Warrior"" program. Bunn said the sauna-like conditions got to several of the people inside. ""They were yelling and yelling, yelling at this man because he was so disoriented that he actually started crawling into the pit with the hot rocks."" Watch what woman saw in sweat lodge . Native Americans used sweat lodges in spiritual and physical purification ceremonies. ""These have been the most difficult 10 days of our lives,"" Ray wrote. ""People are throwing out accusations and disparaging me and our mission. Yet despite that, and despite considerable criticism, I have chosen to continue with my work. It's too important not to."" Ray is widely known for programs that claim to teach people how to create wealth from all aspects of their lives -- financially, mentally, physically, and spiritually. He has appeared on various national programs in the United States, including CNN's ""Larry King Live.""

"Panama City, Panama (CNN) -- North Korea has a message for Panamanian authorities who seized a cargo ship packed with sugar and weapons: Release the boat and let the crew go. ""The Panamanian investigation authorities rashly attacked and detained the captain and crewmen of the ship on the plea of 'drug investigation' and searched its cargo but did not discover any drug,"" a spokesman for North Korean's Foreign Ministry told state-run KCNA on Wednesday. ""Yet, they are justifying their violent action, taking issue with other kind of cargo aboard the ship. This cargo is nothing but aging weapons which are to send back to Cuba after overhauling them according to a legitimate contract."" According to the state media report, the spokesman described the incident as an ""abnormal case."" ""The Panamanian authorities should take a step to let the apprehended crewmen and ship leave without delay,"" the spokesman said, according to KCNA. But Panama showed no signs of stopping its investigation into what it said were undeclared military weapons hidden aboard the North Korean ship. Panama has formally asked the United Nations for guidance on how to handle the case, and expects U.N. representatives to arrive soon in Panama to investigate, Foreign Minister Fernando NuÃ±ez told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Because it is pursuing nuclear weapons, North Korea is banned by the United Nations from importing and exporting most weapons. A spokesman confirmed that Panama had filed a report with the U.N.'s North Korea sanctions committee. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon ""commends the action taken by Panama,"" a spokesman said. In addition to reaching out to the United Nations, Panama also has asked the United States to help provide technical assistance. The details of the dramatic case sound like a deleted scene from the Cold War: a violent confrontation on a detained ship, missiles hidden under sacks of brown sugar, an apparent heart attack and an attempted suicide. The weapons were discovered Monday, and as of Wednesday, authorities were still searching the vessel. The ship originated from Cuba, and Cuban officials admitted that the weapons on board were theirs. They described them as ""240 metric tons of obsolete defensive weapons"" sent to North Korea ""to be repaired and returned to Cuba."" The equipment was manufactured in the mid-20th century and included two anti-aircraft missile systems, nine missiles in parts and spares, two MiG-21 jets and 15 motors for this type of airplane, the Cuban foreign ministry said. The ship's captain -- who allegedly suffered a heart attack and then tried to commit suicide as the cargo was being searched -- and the 35 North Korean crew members have not been charged, but the attorney general's office said they could face charges of threatening national security. The crew resisted arrest and engaged in a ""violent"" confrontation, Panama's security minister, Jose Raul Mulino, said Tuesday. Panama's public ministry ordered the crew's detention, and authorities have since spoken with crew members about their travel plans. Crew members said the North Korean ship had left Cuba and headed toward Panama, aiming to arrive back in North Korea in 51 days. The United States and Panama had been tracking the ship as it crossed the Panama Canal to Cuba and then back, two U.S. officials said. And a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said Wednesday that the United States would help in the investigation. The Panamanians asked the United States for imaging equipment and technicians to fully examine the boat and determine what is on board, according to a U.S. official who declined to be identified because the person was not authorized to speak publicly. Speculation has surged since Panama announced its find, with some warning that it was a troubling sign of weapons deals between North Korea and Cuba, and others disputing whether any dangers lay within the antiquated haul. Cuba says the weapons are ""obsolete."" And experts who identified early Cold War relics such as the Soviet-designed SA-2 air defense system among the ship's cargo say that's not far from the truth. ""Today there is no reason for any Western pilot to be hit by an SA-2 -- if you get caught by one of them, you've done something bloody stupid, or you've got very bad luck,"" said James O'Halloran, editor of Jane's Land Based Air Defence and Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems. ""No modern country wants to be seen with those."" But others saw the weapons haul as a more ominous sign. In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a frequent Cuban government critic, described the weapons shipment as a ""flagrant violation of multiple United Nations Security Council Resolutions."" ""I believe that this revelation, in addition to Cuba's failure to address its abysmal human rights record, should finally prompt the (Obama) administration to re-calibrate its misguided and naive Cuba policy,"" Rubio wrote. ""The administration should immediately reverse its January 2011 decision easing restrictions on people-to-people travel and remittances sent to Cuba; as well as immediately halt granting visas to Cuban government officials."" Forbes.com columnist Gordon Chang told CNN's ""Erin Burnett: OutFront"" that the boat's cargo was a warning sign that North Korea could be supplying Cuba with weapons. ""This is a country which is just 90 miles away from American shores,"" he said. ""Now, if they can smuggle missile radar into Cuba, you know, God knows what else they can put there. We do not need a replay of the Cuban missile crisis, this time with the North Koreans' fingers on the triggers instead of the Soviets."" The U.S. government's assessment is that Cuba might be trying to further its arms relationship with North Korea in the wake of Russia's not being interested in doing the upgrade work on the aging stockpile, a U.S. official said.

"(CNN) -- Arjen Robben said it all -- ""We didn't expect an easy game like that."" Robben could have been forgiven for expecting more of a challenge from one of the most expensively assembled teams in European football. But the Dutchman will not lose too much sleep over the way Manchester City capitulated against a Bayern Munich which simply oozed class. Bayern, which won the European Champions League last year, claimed a 3-1 win -- a result which flattered City for the most part. Easy . ""The first 70 minutes we played some terrific football,"" Robben told Sky Sports. ""We were so dominant against a big team in Europe. We didn't expect an easy game like that. ""It is a compliment to our team but we expected more from City. We didn't give them any space, we pressed them right up to the goalkeeper and they just kicked it away. Sometimes they gave us too much space and we used space well."" City's disastrous flirtation with the Champions League was supposed to end with the arrival of new manager Manuel Pellegrini. It has failed to make it past the group stage in its two previous attempts and it faces a challenge once more. Make no mistake about it -- if this was a boxing contest then the referee would have brought this bout to a halt at halftime. Bayern, which is highly fancied to successfully defend its title this year, produced a level of performance which City could only dream of. From the moment Franck Ribery's drive somehow flew through the grasp of City's goalkeeper Joe Hart, Bayern was rampant. City, which was beaten by Aston Villa in the Premier League at the weekend, looked off the pace and unable to keep up with their opponent. That Bayern managed to score just once in the opening 45 minutes was the only surprise -- but it soon made sure of victory with the help of some inept City defending. Gael Clichy was the guilty party on this occasion, failing to track the run of Thomas Muller, who was afforded the freedom of the penalty area before firing past the stranded Hart. City was stunned and Robben added a third just four minutes later after unleashing a rasping effort which beat Hart at the near post. To its credit, Pellegrini's team did offer a response with substitute Alvaro Negredo curling home a delightful effort with 11 minutes of the contest remaining. City sensed an unlikely comeback with four minutes to go when Jerome Boateng was shown a straight red card after taking out former teammate Yaya Toure. Champions . David Silva curled the free kick against the crossbar but Bayern negotiated the final few minutes to record an emphatic victory. ""We knew they were a really good team and they showed that. That is why they are champions,"" City defender Micah Ricahrds told Sky Sports. ""They didn't play with a striker and there was so much movement. It felt like they had an extra man and I wish them all the best. ""Hopefully we can now improve. We tried, there were some tired legs out there but we can do better than that."" In the group's other game, CSKA Moscow overcame Viktoria Plzen 3-2 to move level on points with City. United . Manchester United was forced to settle for a point in Ukraine after it squandered the advantage to finish 1-1 at Shakhtar Donetsk. Danny Welbeck gave United a first half lead but the home side equalized through Taison with 14 minutes remaining. Ryan Giggs made his 145th Champions League appearance to set a new competition record but he failed to find a way to inspire United to victory. ""The team stood up well tonight,"" United boss David Moyes told Sky Sports. ""We got a good goal early doors. It looked like we would have stopped them from scoring until the goal. ""We said at half time we had to keep the ball better. I'm disappointed we didn't pass it better. If we got the second goal from Robin [Van Persie] we would have seen it out."" Welbeck . United has suffered its worst start to a Premier League season in 24 years and was beaten at home by West Bromwich Albion last weekend. But goalscorer Welbeck was encouraged by his side's latest display. ""In the end it was a decent result,"" he said. ""We got the goal early. They then got a goal and that's the disappointing part. I don't think many teams come here and get three points -- we would have liked to have got three points."" Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen secured a 2-1 home win over Real Sociedad thanks to a last minute strike from Jens Hegeler. Simon Rolfes had given the German side the lead on the stroke of halftime before Carlos Vela equalized for Sociedad. Real . Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Real Madrid eased to a 4-0 win over FC Copenhagen to make it two wins out of two. Angel Di Maria also netted twice as Real moved four points clear at the top of Group B. That's because Juventus was held to a 2-2 draw by Galatasaray in Turin. The home side had looked set for victory after goals from Arturo Vidal and Fabio Quagliarella had canceled out Didier Drogba's opener. But Roberto Mancini's side claimed a dramatic equalizer late on when Umut Bulhut fired home. Ibrahimovic . Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice and Marquinhos grabbed the other as Paris Saint-Germain thrashed Benfica 3-0. The French side have won both of its opening two group games and sits three points clear of Olympiakos in second, which won 3-0 at Anderlecht. The night belonged to Olympiakos star Kostas Mitroglou who became the first Greek to score a hat-trick in the Champions League.","Bayern Munich cruises to victory over Manchester City .

"(CNN) -- Burch Farms has recalled all cantaloupes and honeydew melons it grew this year because of possible listeria contamination, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday. The FDA found Listeria monocytogenes or L. mono on a honeydew melon and at the packing facility in Faison, North Carolina, it announced in a news release. The melons were sold to distributors in 18 states along the East Coast and in the Midwest but may have been resold in other states. Refund for popular kids' vitamins . Consumers can identify the affected cantaloupes by stickers (either Burch Farms or Cottle Strawberry) attached to them. People concerned they have bought Burch Farm honeydew melons should call the store where they purchased them and ask where the melons originated. Those melons do not have a sticker. The FDA says it doesn't know of anyone getting sick because of eating these products. Listeriosis is preceded by flu-like symptoms including a fever, according to the FDA website. Symptoms include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. People at risk include infants, pregnant women, adults with weakened immune systems and older adults.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Mothers sit propped against pillows and gym mats at the ""Real Birth"" baby clinic in New York City. It's a sea of unwashed hair, women of various ages and professions, complicit smiles and apologies for not looking more put together. The diverse women share a common drive: the desire to breast-feed their babies. They believe it's the best nutrition, but they have difficulty, for reasons ranging from low milk production to adopted babies to problems with some babies latching on. Formula makers and the FDA say the amount of bisphenol-A in formula cans is not dangerous. ""Breast-feeding was my absolute first choice,"" says Helen Niblock, cradling her newborn and watching tentatively as she puts 5-week-old Emma on a scale. ""I actually cried when they told me that I had to give her formula in the hospital."" Niblock gives Emma Enfamil from a can to supplement her diet. But a research group says the cans that contain the formula are lined with a toxic, potentially harmful chemical. The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy and research organization, says in a new report released to CNN that liquid formula from the nation's top baby formula makers is sold in cans lined with bisphenol-A, or BPA. The formula makers acknowledge the presence of BPA, but say it is not harmful. The Food and Drug Administration agrees. The Environmental Working Group is a nonprofit research organization focused on public health and the environment. It does not take money from special interest groups. The group previously raised concerns about the presence of BPA in plastic baby bottles and is pushing for regulation of the compound.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta explains the Environmental Working Group's findings » . The group says, based on its analysis of existing research on BPA, even a very small amount of the compound may cause a host of problems, from brain and behavioral disorders to cancer, a claim the formula makers and federal regulators adamantly deny. ""BPA is a chemical that is harmful at very low doses,"" says Jane Houlihan, the organization's vice president for research. ""We're talking about millions of babies exposed every year to this toxic chemical that's found in infant formula."" BPA is a fairly ubiquitous chemical used in polycarbonate plastic products, including baby bottles and metal can coatings. It protects the food inside from the can. It's legal. According to the FDA and the infant formula industry, which adheres to federal packaging guidelines, it is safe. Formula maker Nestle USA says all U.S. formula companies use cans from suppliers who use bisphenol-A. ""The FDA has found these materials to be safe, and to pose no risk whatsoever to consumers. We stand by our products in these type of cans as being safe,"" the company says. ""There are inherent risks in any material that could be considered for packaging,"" says Mead-Johnson, makers of Enfamil. ""Babies are what we do and safety is of paramount importance. We don't consider there to be a risk."" Regulators say the trace amounts infants are exposed to won't hurt them. ""An infant would have to ingest over 7,100 times more than the current daily dietary exposure to BPA before there would be the potential for an adverse toxic effect,"" the FDA says in a statement. While the FDA acknowledges it is actively reviewing safety data on BPA, it sees no reason to ban it or restrict its use in formula cans. But safety data on BPA are a point of contention. The National Toxicology Program's Center for the Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction convened an expert panel to determine if BPA is a hazard to humans, including more sensitive developing babies. The panel concluded, based on animal studies, that there's ""some risk"" exposure to BPA causes neural and behavioral effects in children. But there's a clear lack of scientific consensus on the definition of ""some risk."" Also at issue is the lack of research on humans. ""There's a lot of data out there, a lot of science that is looking at the effect of BPA in animals, but we don't have any data unfortunately in humans, so it makes it a little bit hard to know what's worrisome and what's not, "" says Dr. Ari Brown, a member of the Academy of Pediatrics and author of the book ""Baby 411."" The confusing messages have sent moms like Niblock into a tailspin. ""As a new mom there are so many warnings and scares out there you have to take it in stride and do what you think is best for your own child,"" she says. But how do already stressed new parents know what is best? While the American Academy of Pediatrics has no formal position on BPA, some of its member doctors, including Brown, are taking the message into their own hands. ""I tell parents in my practice there is some concern for exposure of BPA in infants and young children. So if there's an easy, cheap way to limit or reduce the exposure in your child's life, why not do it?"" While parents don't have definitive answers, they do have choices, including powdered formula or liquid formula not packaged in cans, and BPA-free baby bottles. Another BPA-free choice for mothers who can do it is exclusive breastfeeding -- the gold standard of infant nutrition. The formula industry says there's no need for feeding changes for infants, as does the International Formula Council. Niblock isn't so sure. ""I would do anything in the world to make sure she's growing the right way, and that I'm doing what's healthiest for my baby,"" she says. For now, between breastfeeding classes and learning how to negotiate the streets of New York with a stroller, Niblock's duties include homework on BPA. She says she's prepared to ditch the canned formula if she decides that's the safest way to feed her baby. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge determined Wednesday that Shannon Richardson, an actress accused of sending ricin-laced letters to President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is a ""flight risk"" and thus must remain behind bars. The Texas woman, also known as Shannon Rogers and Shannon Guess, was arrested in June. She was ordered to undergo a mental evaluation, and late last month, she was found competent to stand trial. The actress has pleaded not guilty on all counts. Richardson was in a federal court in Texarkana, Texas, for a roughly 30-minute detention hearing Wednesday morning. According to a court document, her lawyer and prosecutors both presented their arguments as to why she should be allowed to go free on bail or, conversely, why she should remain in custody. Judge Caroline Craven concluded that, although Richardson probably isn't ""a danger to the community,"" she is ""a serious flight risk, and no conditions will ensure her appearance."" As a result, Craven ordered the 35-year-old to remain detained pending her trial. Three envelopes containing the natural, highly toxic compound derived from castor beans were mailed from Shreveport, Louisiana, in May. They were discovered, before causing any injuries or fatalities, with what the FBI described as ""very low concentrations"" of ricin. What is ricin? Richardson -- who has had minor roles in television series including ""The Walking Dead"" and ""The Vampire Diaries"" -- initially told FBI agents that her now-estranged husband Nathaniel had sent the ricin-tainted letters. But, authorities have said, Richardson was found to be ""deceptive"" in a polygraph exam. Investigators found that her computer storage devices contained the text of threatening letters sent to the president. But the couple's computer records show that her husband couldn't have printed them out because he was at work at the time, according to an FBI arrest affidavit. Eventually, Richardson admitted to investigators that she'd mailed the letters, though she claimed her husband had typed them out and forced her to print and mail them, the affidavit said. Actress first accuses husband, then is arrested in ricin case . Nathaniel Richardson denied doing any such thing, telling investigators that his wife was ""intentionally misleading"" them and that she'd wanted to end their marriage and leave them, court papers said. He filed for divorce in June, and court papers indicated that Shannon Richardson was pregnant.","A federal judge says Shannon Richardson isn't a danger to the community .

"Boston (CNN) -- For Erika Brannock, Monday was a long time coming -- 50 days in fact. That's how long she was hospitalized after bomb blasts at the Boston Marathon ripped apart her legs. She was the last of the more than 250 victims from that attack to be released. ""I leave here today -- after 11 surgeries, some pretty dark moments, and 50 days in this hospital -- with nothing but admiration for this great city,"" said Brannock, who was treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. On the day of the marathon, she, her sister and her brother-in-law had gone to watch Brannock's mother run. They were standing near the finish line when the bombs went off. Video shows Tsarnaevs at gym days before attack . ""I fell backwards, and I could see oranges and yellows,"" Brannock told CNN's AC360 on Monday. ""I could hear the sirens and people crying and screaming. But I never heard the actual boom."" ""I had a conversation with God in my head, and I told him I wasn't ready to go."" Just at that moment, a woman crawled over to Brannock and grabbed her hand. She used her belt as a tourniquet on Brannock's leg. ""She had heard me screaming for help and she said, 'My name is Joan from California, and I'm not going to let you go.' And she stayed with me the whole time."" In runners' tent and ER, a rush to save limbs and lives . Brannock, 29, credits this mystery woman with saving her life. She desperately wants to find and thank her.

""I would not be here today without the talent and devotion of my care team, as well as the first responders and the marathon spectator -- who I only know as 'Joan from California' -- wherever you are -- you saved my life,"" she said. Sister of boy killed at Boston Marathon released from hospital . 'We will thrive again' The double bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15 killed three people and injured at least 264. Brannock's sister, Nicole Gross, had a broken leg and remained hospitalized for 33 days. Her sister's husband suffered cuts, bruises and burns. Dancer's foot destroyed, but not her spirit .

"(CNN) -- Reports of rapes, killings and other horrors are growing in the Central African Republic. Rights groups accuse security forces and militia gangs of torturing civilians as world leaders warn that the nation is on the verge of a genocide. Here's a quick primer to get you up to speed on the escalating situation. 1. First things first. Tell me about the Central African Republic . The tiny, landlocked nation in central Africa is home to about 5 million people. It declared independence from France in 1960, and has since been led by presidents or emperors. Some have been elected while others seized power by force. Despite vast resources, including gold, timber, diamonds and uranium, it's among the poorest nations in the world. The riches from the minerals don't trickle down to the population, fueling resentment. Lack of good governance does not help, either. 2. So what's going on with all the chaos? It started off as anti-government resentment. A coalition of rebels named Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize in March, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence. They accused the president of reneging on a peace deal, and demanded that he step down. Months before his ouster, both sides had brokered a deal to form a unity government led by the president. But that deal fell apart as the rebel coalition pushed its way from the north toward the capital of Bangui, seizing towns along the way. Rebels infiltrated the capital in March, sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon. 3. What happened after the president left? The nation plunged into complete chaos. Political turmoil raged. Looters hit the main cities. Violence became the order of the day. Aid agencies warned of a humanitarian crisis as fear of the rebels prevented critically injured patients from going to health facilities. An unknown number of people have been killed in remote rural areas that are too risky to access. More than 400,000 people have been internally displaced, according to the United Nations. That's nearly 10% of the population. 4. Who's in charge of the nation now? After the president fled, Seleka named its commander, Michel Djotodia, as the new leader. He took over and integrated some of the rebel fighters into the army, analysts say. 5. Was this the nation's first instance of instability? No. Political turmoil is nothing new for the Central African Republic. About a decade ago, Bozize led a coup that deposed his predecessor. Though he later won elections in 2005 and 2011, he did not have full control of the nation. Rebel groups ran amok for years, especially in rural areas. In fact, four of the nation's five presidents since independence have been ousted through unconstitutional means. 6. OK, the President left and the rebels got their wish. Why's the fighting ongoing? Some say say greed is a factor. Ousted government officials have long accused Seleka of going after the country's vast minerals. Then there's the reprisal aspect. When the president fled, the poorly-trained national army didn't stand a chance against the rebels. Rebels capitalized on the army's weakness and went on a rampage, human rights groups say. The list of horrors is endless: rape, torture, kidnappings, looting. To counter the attacks, vigilante groups formed. Reprisals led to more mayhem. The country descended into anarchy and the United Nations warned that ""the seeds of a genocide are being sown."" 7. What role does religion play in the tensions? Good question. Rights groups say Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition. As history has shown over and over, religious loyalties can breed contempt and escalate conflicts. In addition, the conflict has exposed years of marginalization and discrimination against the northern, predominantly Muslim population, the United Nations says. Left uncontrolled, militia groups are banding along religious lines. Most of the vigilante groups fighting back are Christian, leading to fears of a full-blown conflict between the country's Christians and Muslims. 8. All this is happening a world away. Why should I care? The Central African Republic is surrounded by countries struggling to emerge from years of conflict. South Sudan, Sudan's Darfur region, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Chad are barely stable. Any instability is sure to have ripple effects that'll be hard to ignore worldwide. CAR is also believed to be one of Joseph Kony's hideouts. The United States sent special forces to the region last year to help hunt down Kony, the brutal leader of the Lord Resistance Army. In a sign of a potentially expanded role, the Pentagon recently said it's considering sending aircraft to assault the Kony militia. The chaos not only risk destabilizing the region, they could complicate the Kony mission. 9. What's the current government doing? The current president has tried to distance himself by disbanding Seleka, Human Rights Watch says.  Djotodia, the president, has denied assertions that his country is on the brink of a genocide. ""I don't think there's a genocide, there's not even a religious war, all of this is made up, it's to manipulate, to manipulate the opinion of the international community,"" he told Reuters. He accused the former regime of fueling the rebellion. ""They want to create a religious war by all means possible,"" he says. ""That's what Bozize wants."" 10. What is the international community doing? Though world leaders have warned of mass atrocities if nothing is done, the response has been limited. Last month, France pledged to send 1,000 more troops to add to the 400 it already has there. The current troops in the nation, it says, are there in a noncombat mission to protect French nationals and help secure the airport in the capital. An African Union force is already in the nation. The United Nations has suggested its peacekeeping force should eventually replace the African-led mission known, as MISCA. That potential force could number about 6,000 troops and 1,700 police personnel. Turning it into a U.N. peacekeeping operation would boost financial and logistical support.","A coalition of rebels ousted President Francois Bozize in March .

"(CNN) -- The memory unit that may tell why an Air France jet plunged into the Atlantic nearly two years ago was recovered from the bottom of the ocean Sunday, France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said. A remote-controlled submarine, known as the Remora 6000, located the memory unit Sunday morning and it was lifted on board the search ship Ile de Sein six hours later, the Paris-based BEA said. All 228 people aboard the Air France Flight 447 were killed when the plane fell into the ocean on the way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on June 1, 2009. The submarine found the orange-colored flight data recorder's chassis Wednesday, the second day of an operation that also hopes to retrieve bodies from the wreckage site. The memory unit was part of the recorder, but was not attached when it was found. The flight recorder chassis is found last week . The finds come more than three weeks after search teams found the tail section of the Airbus A330. Air France, in a written statement Sunday, called the discovery ""very significant."" ""We hope that the BEA, in charge of the technical investigation, will be able to provide answers to questions that relatives of the victims, Air France and the entire airline industry have been asking for nearly two years as to why this tragic accident occurred,"" the airline's statement said. A British aviation consultant said he is skeptical about how useful the memory unit will be to investigators, considering it has been sitting between 2,000 to 4,000 meters (6,562 to 13,124 feet) below the ocean's surface for 23 months. ""If you were to throw a computer into the ocean, imagine how all the parts would eventually split and you have the corrosive effects of seawater and the depths involved,"" Phil Seymour, chief operating officer of the International Bureau of Aviation, said Thursday. Father of crash victim: Leave remains . ""It may be that the more wreckage they find will help them to piece it all together, which bit by bit could help them build a picture of what caused the plane to come down,"" Seymour said. Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the Paris-based BEA, says there is a good chance the memory unit, which records any instructions sent to the aircraft's electronic systems, will still hold retrievable data. The Airbus A330's pilots lost contact with air traffic controllers while flying across an area of the Atlantic Ocean known for constant bands of severe turbulence, officials said. Q&A: Will mystery ever be solved? But exactly what caused the plane to plunge into the sea has remained a mystery, with only small portions of the wreckage and a handful of bodies found in the remote area where it went down.

"(CNN) -- At least 27 people were killed Sunday night when a cargo train slammed into two cars south of Cairo, the state-run Egynews media outlet reported, citing Giza Gov. Ali Abdulrahman. More than 25 other people were injured, Egypt's head of emergency services told Egynews. It was not immediately clear what led up to the crash. Deadly train crashes are not uncommon in Egypt. In January, train cars filled with Egyptian security force recruits hopped the tracks and crashed in Giza, killing at least 19 people and injuring about 107 others. In November 2012, 51 died and 17 were injured when a train slammed into a bus in Assiut, a city about 320 kilometers (about 200 miles) south of Cairo. And in October 2009, at least 15 were killed when two trains collided in Al-Ayyat, about 70 kilometers (about 43 miles) south of the capital.

"(CNN) -- Rapid economic growth, rich stores of natural resources and a fast-growing population have all helped usher in a new era of optimism around Africa's future. But is there a missing link that's preventing the continent's economies from boosting their business potential and achieving their development goals? ""Yes,"" claims the African Management Initiative, pointing out the continent's ""acute shortage"" of high-quality, well-trained local managers. The Johannesburg-based group wants to tackle the continent's talent gap by creating one million skilled African managers over the next 10 years. ""The demand is there,"" says Rebecca Harrison, director of the non-profit organization. ""We meet business owner after business owner across the continent who tell us that, if they are growing, then getting good managers is the biggest challenge right now."" Read this: Hotels, the latest African gold rush . Harrison describes poor management in Africa as one of the biggest ""bottlenecks for growth"" across a range of organizations -- from large companies and multinationals to governments and NGOs. But more importantly, she says, it's holding back the ""engine of job creation"" in most countries: small and medium-size businesses. ""We read headlines every day about 'Africa Rising,' we are seeing African economies take off and we are just finding on the ground that these small and medium-size companies are unable to grow, create more jobs and expand their businesses because of that lack of middle-management capacity."" Aiming high . For sure, creating one million well-trained, locally grown managers by 2023 to spearhead Africa's business development is an overly ambitious proposition in a continent where top business schools are few and far between -- there are about 90 institutions offering an MBA in Africa, according to an AMI report, whereas India has more than 1,500. The AMI, which says it has a network of more than 5,000 African managers and entrepreneurs, estimates that there are about 10 million people in managerial and supervisory positions across the continent. ""If we can reach one in 10 of the 10 million managers out there indirectly, if we can have one in 10 African managers operating really effectively, then the continent will be a different place,"" says Harrison. Educating future managers . To achieve its target, the AMI, which gets most of its funding from the Lundin Foundation, in Canada, has started launching a series of initiatives designed to expand access to key education tools, including a virtual campus tailored specifically for African managers and entrepreneurs. ""What we want to do is leapfrog the traditional bricks-and-mortar approach to business schools and business training,"" says Harrison. ""We want to leverage technology to deliver high-quality practical relevant management education at a price that people can afford, combining online content with offline peer support."" Read this: Africa's new skyscraper cities . On June 17, the AMI began its pilot of a two-week course where participants access free web-based practical tutorials in the form of video, audio or text to sharpen their management skills. The ""Launchpad: Success@Work in 21st Century Africa"" module, which will have low bandwidth requirements and be available on mobile, will cover topics such as effective communication, goal setting and time management. Harrison says it is part of the AMI's efforts to eventually develop Africa's first full-blown Massively Open Online Course (MOOC), in conjunction with three of Africa's leading business schools -- Nigeria's Lagos Business School, Kenya's Strathmore Business School and South Africa's Gordon Institute of Business Science . ""The idea is to partner with the business schools in the continent and get the business teachers to deliver their content online and then to support that with offline learning,"" says Harrison. ""So the model is the learning is free but if you want a certificate you pay a small fee."" The AMI says about 600 people have signed up for the pilot MOOC.","A South Africa-based group wants to create one million managers by 2023 .

"(CNN) -- The church where Colleen Ritzer's family worshiped was filled with mourners for the slain Massachusetts math teacher's funeral Monday. ""You can see the effect she has had and how the community has bonded together to commemorate and celebrate Colleen's life,"" Ritzer's cousin, Gina McDaniel, said in her eulogy. About 400 Danvers High School students were among the estimated 1,000 people who gathered to pay final respects to Ritzer, who was killed allegedly by one of her own students -- 14-year-old Philip Chism -- a week earlier. ""Colleen loved her brother and sister very much and always did her best to be a sister, friend, and mentor to them,"" McDaniel said. ""She is the daughter that every parent hopes their children will become once they grow up."" Many mourners wore pink clothing -- Ritzer's favorite color -- and pink flowers decorated the outside of Andover's St. Augustine Church. ""Colleen's gift was that of inspiration,"" McDaniel said. ""In such a short period of time, one person has made a world of difference."" The Rev. Peter G. Gori, in his homily, offered advice on how to approach Ritzer's death. Â  ""Perhaps we should ask not why, or even how she died, but rather why and how did she live,"" Gori said. Ritzer's parents, brother and sister followed the hearse to a private burial for family and close friends. Ritzer, 24, was found dead in woods near the campus where she taught Tuesday morning. Authorities are still investigating the motive for her killing. Documents filed in a Tennessee court 12 years ago may shed light on Chism's past. The documents showed that Chism's father agreed during a separation from his mother to have restricted time with his son, who was then 2, because of ""prior physical and emotional abuse as well as alcohol abuse."" The documents, however, said the parents were attempting to reconcile. Chism's uncle, Terrence Chism Blaine, told CNN that the boy's parents are now separated and that the father -- a former military man -- now lives in Florida. Blaine told CNN affiliate WKRN in Nashville, Tennessee, last week that something may have provoked his nephew. ""Might could have been upset,"" Blaine said. ""You know -- teenagers go through that. He's 14, he's growing up still. That's the only thing that I can imagine. I can't imagine anything else because he's like a storybook kid -- a perfect family."" Chism's mother, Diana Chism, released a statement through her son's attorney saying her ""heart is broken for the Ritzer family and the loss of their daughter and sister Colleen Ritzer."" ""Her son was born in love and is dear to her, very dear,"" the statement said. ""She is struggling to understand this.""

"(CNN) -- Of all things to steal, you'd think love letters would be low on the list. But that's exactly what thieves took from Lloyd and Marian Michael -- the couple's sweet letters and the sleeping memories they stirred. ""We were just overwhelmed ... so sad,"" said Marian, 88, about the day they discovered them missing. Still, she and Lloyd, 89, were never the type for self-pity. What could they do? They moved on. Then, several decades later, the Michaels got a strange message on their answering machine. The caller, a military veteran, had painstakingly tracked them down after his father's death. He said he had news about their letters. ""We thought, 'Oh, it must be a mistake,' "" Marian said. It wasn't. In love and war . Lloyd and Marian met at a California high school in the 1940s, when Bing Crosby was big, a stamp cost 3 cents, and war raged around the world. For their first date, Lloyd took Marian to a dance at a civic center. He told his family that night he'd found his girl. Marian took some convincing, but Lloyd's persistence paid off. ""I think that the war situation was so intense at that time,"" she said. ""It was just important for him to find a girlfriend and for me to find a boyfriend. That's what we were, girl- and boyfriend."" They married on December 31, 1942, just about a year after the attack on Pearl Harbor that drew the United States into World War II. Lloyd had joined the U.S. Army Air Forces by that point, and had to get a weekend pass for the wedding. They were madly in love and eager to start their new life, but the war had plans of its own. After the wedding, the Army sent Lloyd to Mississippi for aircraft mechanic training, then back to California and on to New Jersey before he deployed to Europe, where Marian could not follow. To stay connected, the newlyweds wrote each other as often as they could -- open, affectionate letters describing how much they missed each other and longed to be together. ""Darling, I can hear Bing (Crosby) singing over the loudspeaker,"" wrote Lloyd on July 6, 1944. ""He is singing 'By the Light of the Silvery Moon.' Boy, he can really sing. Marian, remember the old moon down in Mississippi ... ""That moon means more than ever to me now. Just right when I got into my foxhole, I could look out and see that old moon shining so very bright. It was so very full. I got a very warm feeling inside of me just sitting there, laying there, and looking at it, and thinking of you."" Lloyd later explained the motif of the moon: ""We had made a commitment when we left that we'd kiss the moon at night."" ""If you think about it ... the moon, wherever you're at, the other party will see that same moon that day,"" he said. ""That moon would be over her."" The couple made other promises too. Before Lloyd left, he and Marian bought identical maps of Europe. In his letters, Lloyd wrote the position on his map that matched, more or less, where he was. The censors never cracked their code. Lloyd was deployed overseas for 27 months. He served in England, Germany, Belgium and France, arriving in Normandy just 12 days after the historic invasion. After the war, he returned to California. He and Marian made a life in Alta Loma, outside Los Angeles, where they raised four children. The Michaels locked their love letters in a trunk for safekeeping, along with the rest of Lloyd's war memorabilia. They put the trunk in a shed. But sometime in the late 1960s, or early 1970s -- the Michaels aren't sure -- someone gutted their shed, snatching the trunk and everything in it. ""We just accepted that they were gone forever, probably trashed. We never dreamed we'd ever see them,"" Marian said. ""And when we had this message from this young man on the phone we just couldn't believe it."" A mystery man . The man at the other end of the line had a plan when he dialed the Michaels' phone last fall. Using Lloyd's Army serial number, he had tracked the couple down. Apparently, there had been a number of men with the name Lloyd Michael in the service. But there was just one with a wife named Marian. He asked the Michaels to meet at a nearby In-N-Out Burger. It was about 12:30 in the afternoon when they pulled into the parking lot. ""He undoubtedly saw two old, gray-haired people walk right in, and got out of his car and walked over and said: 'Are you Lloyd Michael?' "" Lloyd said. ""Handed me this big box he had of our letters."" The man told the Michaels he had come across their correspondence as he was going through his father's things. His father, a stamp collector, had died. Maybe his father bought the letters, hoping their stamps would be worth something one day. But who knows? The man wasn't saying much, and the Michaels didn't want to pry. ""I don't want to put him through that,"" Lloyd said. ""He just did something that was a marvelous thing for him to do."" As quickly as he entered the Michaels' lives, the man left. They tried to buy his lunch. But he wouldn't take a thing. Later, they sent the man a box of candy for Christmas anyway. ""He'd been a veteran himself, and he had a boy that had been in either Iraq or Afghanistan and had just returned home. So he knew what letters meant to him, his family -- the same thing,"" Lloyd said. ""He just thought ... they weren't his, and he wanted to get them back to where they belong."" 'Sweetheart, all my life is yours' The letters are written in tiny print, many on thin onion skin paper. Most have upside down stamps, which was the Michaels' way of saying: ""I love you."" They got back 241 letters, which they say is just a fraction of the many hundreds they sent each other over the years. As they read through their letters, they often have to stop on account of tears, both happy and sad. Reading one out loud, Marian's voice broke. The emotion was raw, as if she was reading the letter for the first time and still waiting and worrying for a husband in harm's way. ""They're pretty difficult for us to read. It just brings back all the agony, and the worry, and the concern,"" she said. Though some letters were serious, others were playful. The Michaels poked gentle fun at themselves and each other, and imagined what they were going to do when the war was over. They shared the sort of small details that make up a life. ""Guess what we're going to have for supper!"" Marian wrote in a letter dated December 8, 1944. ""It's really going to be a treat because we haven't had any for so long. We're going to have bacon! Boy, now that's really something in this neck of the woods. ... Pork is a luxury these days."" Though times were tough and being separated was hard, Lloyd said he and Marian never really wrote about their problems. ""That would just burden the other party,"" he said. ""We were always trying to give the best that we had."" Reading from her December 8, 1944, letter, Marian hints at the other reason why Lloyd said they initially kept their letters under lock and key -- to keep their children's prying eyes out of their most private exchanges: . ""Darling, I love you more every day. It seems as if I'm wanting your caresses more and more, and I'm wanting your kisses more ... I'm wanting you more and more. Sweetheart, all my life is yours."" Her promise proved true. Surrounded by family and friends, the Michaels celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary in December, shortly after they were reunited with their letters. Where the rest are is anyone's guess, but they are grateful they got back what they did. ""It's bringing back all the memories. But it can't draw the two of us any closer than we are,"" Lloyd said. ""We've been up and down life -- been to the top of it and down to the bottom. We're just a couple determined to make the best out of our lives.""","Lloyd and Marian Michael married in December 1942, a year after the U.S. joined WW II .

"(CNN) -- The former lead investigator in the JonBenet Ramsey case says that newly released documents may spark renewed interest, but they have little effect on the cold case investigation. Previously sealed court documents released Friday show that a Colorado grand jury voted in 1999 to indict the parents of the slain 6-year-old JonBenet on charges of child abuse resulting in death and being accessories to a crime. Court papers: Grand jury in 1999 sought to indict JonBenet Ramsey's parents . The district attorney decided that year, however, not to file charges against John and Patricia Ramsey, saying there was insufficient evidence. In 2008, a new district attorney said new DNA evidence cleared the parents and their son in the death. The case has never been solved, and the released documents have put the killing back in the spotlight. But attention does not necessarily translate into leads in the case, former lead investigator A. James Kolar told CNN. ""It is unlikely unless there is a confession, or somebody else comes forward that has information that has been shared with them,"" he said. Read the documents . Kolar wrote a book about JonBenet's killing and said he does not believe that there was an intruder at the Ramsey house that night, implying that the Ramsey family -- the late Patricia Ramsey, her husband John and their son Burke -- know more than they have told. What exactly was it that kept the district attorney from pursuing the charges? ""That's a very complicated question. I think there are a lot of things that could be considered missing from the D.A.'s perspective to be able to bring them to a threshold of prosecuting beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Kolar said. Still, the documents released Friday are an important part of the history of the case. A Colorado court ordered the release of the previously sealed court documents about the unsolved 1996 death of the girl who won child beauty pageants and whose murder shocked the nation. The pages were sealed in 1999, after the grand jury in the case dispersed without charges being filed.","New documents in the JonBenet Ramsey case were released Friday .

"(CNN) -- The federal agency that protects the nation's borders is doing a shoddy job protecting the nation's wallet, abusing an overtime fund to the tune of $8.7 million annually, according to a government watchdog. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency that receives whistleblower complaints, said offices within Customs and Border Protection and elsewhere within the Department of Homeland Security engage in a ""gross waste of government funds."" Overtime money intended for special circumstances was routinely given to employees who frequently spent that time watching sports and entertainment channels, Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner wrote in a letter to the White House. Employees working in CBP's ""Situation Room"" received overtime 89 percent of the time, Lerner said. ""This case is not an isolated occurrence. Rather, it is part of a persistent pattern of AUO [Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime] allegations raised by DHS employees,"" Lerner wrote. The problem was brought to light, the OSC said, by several CBP employees who were authorized to receive the overtime pay but were troubled by the ethics of the practice and its impact on the federal budget. The DHS said in a statement that Acting Secretary Rand Beers had requested a ""comprehensive, department-wide review of the use of (administrative overtime)."" ""DHS takes seriously its responsibility to ensure proper use of taxpayer funds,"" spokesman Peter Boogaard said. DHS made a similar promise after allegations of overtime abuse surfaced in 2008, the Special Counsel said. In February of that year, a whistleblower alleged abuses at the Office of Border Patrol in Lynden, Washington. After a department report confirmed that employees abused overtime and that senior managers benefited from improperly approved overtime, the agency promised to implement ""an Agency-wide AUO policy directive"" to prevent misuse throughout the agency. ""That commitment was made more than five years ago,"" Lerner wrote in her letter to the White House. ""The lack of progress in implementing plans first outlined five years ago raises questions about the agency's willingness or ability to confront this important problem."" The use of administrative overtime ""functionally [extended] their daily shift by two hours each day, but are not the result of any unpredictable or compelling law enforcement need,"" Lerner wrote. Lerner wrote that DHS must curb the abuse and, if warranted, revise the pay system to ensure fair pay for employees who are legitimately working overtime. The OSC said it is investigating whistleblower allegations of overtime abuse at five DHS locations: . -- CBP's Office of Training and Development in Glynco, Georgia. -- U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' Office of Security and Integrity in Washington. -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Houston. -- CBP's facility in San Ysidro, California. -- CBP's facility in Laredo, Texas. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said the revelations the overtime allowance is meant for agents who work unique hours ""often in pursuit of drug smugglers"" and other people ""who pose a threat"" to the nation. ""This money was not meant to be a slush fund for officers or agents at desk jobs who work regular hours and who are clearly taking advantage of the system,"" he said. ""The Committee will continue to investigate abuses such as this.""","Whistleblower watchdog says overtime fund abused by $8.7 million annually .

"(CNN) -- U.S. ambassador to China Gary Locke is nearing the end of a three-day visit to the Tibet Autonomous Region where he has been meeting with local officials to impress the importance of preserving Tibetan culture, according to the U.S. embassy. Locke, who took the trip with his family, several embassy officials and Chengdu's consulate general, also stressed the need to open up access to Tibet to foreign diplomats, tourists and journalists, the embassy said in a statement. There has been no mention of the trip in Chinese media, which follows Locke's visit last September to Tibetan monasteries in western China, where a number of Tibetan monks have set themselves on fire. OPINION: Obama must turn up the heat on Tibet . Since 2006, 119 monks have self-immolated in protest against Chinese policies they say violate their basic rights, according to Human Rights Watch. More claims of repression of Tibetan rights came Thursday with a report from HRW, which condemned China's mass relocation of millions of Tibetans to what it called ""New Socialist Villages."" The report, entitled ""They Say We Should Be Grateful,"" accused the Chinese government of committing ""extensive rights violations"" of Tibetans by forcing residents in a number of counties to abandon their houses and move to new purpose-built housing estates. The HRW report included aerial images of Tibetan counties, which showed photos of villages before and after new homes were built. HRW has accused the Chinese government of failing to adequately compensate villagers whose homes have been demolished, and of not restoring residents' livelihoods. ""The scale and speed at which the Tibetan rural population is being remodeled by mass rehousing and relocation policies are unprecedented in the post-Mao era,"" said HRW's China director, Sophie Richardson. ""Tibetans have no say in the design of policies that are radically altering their way of life, and -- in an already highly repressive context -- no ways to challenge them,"" she added in a statement. When asked to comment on the report, Hua Chunying, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson said: ""The organization you just mentioned has been consistently making irresponsible remarks and groundless accusations against China. I'll not spend time to read the report or comment on it."" According to the report, since 2006 more than two million Tibetans have been ""rehoused"" -- through government-ordered renovation or construction of new houses -- in the Tibet Autonomous Region, while hundreds of thousands of nomadic herders in the eastern part of the Tibetan plateau have been relocated. The massive rehousing project is part of China's policy to ""Build a New Socialist Countryside"" in Tibetan areas, which was announced by former premier Wen Jiabao in 2006. At the time, the government pledged to increase spending in rural areas and committed billions of dollars to raise the living standards in the countryside. Earlier this year, as part of its Report on China's Economic and Social Development, the government vowed to ""give high priority to developing the western region on a large scale."" ""We will more quickly open up the region to the outside world, and create a number of leading areas to open up and develop border regions and the hinterland. We will implement the policies and measures to develop Xinjiang, Tibet, and Tibetan ethnic areas in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces in leaps and bounds,"" the report said.","U.S.: Locke meeting officials to impress importance of preserving Tibetan culture .

"(CNN) -- For listeners of police scanners, last week's tragic events offered one real-time drama after another. During the fertilizer plant explosion in Texas that claimed 14 lives and the Boston Marathon bombings and subsequent manhunt, dispatchers' static-filled audio feeds offered periodic clues about what was happening on the ground. Listeners hungry for the most up-to-date police reports didn't need a scanner to keep up with the news -- many scanner feeds are available online, while some Twitter users type out what they hear on scanners in real time. Technology has given people more access to what's being said on scanner feeds, often to the dismay of law enforcement agencies worried about the spread of misinformation and criminals eavesdropping on authorities' tactical plans. Early Friday, as the night's manhunt for the bombing suspects stretched into daylight, Broadcastify, the primary online source for scanner feeds, did something it had never done before: It voluntarily took all the Boston law enforcement feeds offline. Broadcastify licenses its streams to mobile apps such as 5-0 radio for iPhone or Scanner Radio on Android and is powered by an army of hobbyist volunteers -- local reporters, neighborhood watch members, off-duty public safety officers -- who just want to share what they're hearing. They plug their scanner or radio into a computer and use special software to broadcast it online. Broadcastify streams around 3,500 scanner channels, including local law enforcement, fire departments, weather service, emergency medical services and the International Space Station. During peak traffic times last week, some 180,000 listeners were tuned in to Broadcastify feeds at once -- by far the most traffic the service had ever seen, said founder Lindsay Blanton. But when the Boston police posted a plea on Twitter asking that people not compromise the safety of officers by broadcasting what homes were being searched, Broadcastify obliged. Online, the curious quickly found alternative ways to tune in. Some people with their own scanners started live video streams of chatter from the radios in their homes. Others with access to scanners began tweeting out snippets of what they heard. Concerns about the safety of broadcasting police feeds have been amplified as technology has moved from clunky, home-bound radios to handheld radios, the Web and now mobile apps available on any smartphone. While law-abiding citizens can now listen in anywhere, criminals can, too. ""They (criminals) always carry radios or carry cellphones that have police scanners on them,"" said Sgt. Richard Lewis of the Santa Monica, California, police. Broadcastify's Blanton stands by his decision to take down the Boston channels, but he maintains that scanner feeds do more public good than harm. ""You're going to be hard-pressed to evade law enforcement (by) reading stuff on Twitter,"" said Blanton, who added he has never heard of a criminal successfully using the service to escape police. Safety first . Even so, a number of safety precautions are already in place. More sensitive public safety information is often communicated over discreet channels, not the well-known dispatch channels. There is no law requiring public agencies to keep feeds publicly available, so many cities have opted to encrypt some or all of their transmissions. ""The decision to go encrypted was for the safety of officers and security of the community, because when you can hear us on a scanner so can bad guys,"" said Lewis, the Santa Monica police sergeant. His department made the move from open radio channels to an encrypted system in 2008. Since then, most complaints about being cut off have come from local reporters who use scanners to get tipped off to crimes. Upgrading to an encrypted system isn't a quick fix. The new equipment is expensive, and encryption comes with its own issues. It makes it difficult to communicate with other departments and agencies during an emergency. For example, the manhunt in Boston was a multiagency effort, involving federal and local command centers and various groups all trying to communicate with each other, which couldn't have been done using just encrypted communication channels. For its part, Broadcastify time-delays all feeds for 30 to 90 seconds. Its terms of service prohibit providers from streaming sensitive feeds such as tactical, SWAT, narcotics and fire investigation channels as well as most federal government channels. A bad game of telephone . The bigger concern for some is the spread of misinformation, which can contribute to confusion, panic and, in the case of the Boston bombings, mistaken identity. People communicating over the radio are often just as confused about fluid situations as their listeners are. Officials say anyone tuning into a live scanner feed, or reading a transcription of a feed on social media, should not assume that everything they're hearing is accurate. Lewis said the earliest information to come across scanners can often be wrong, and that the first eyewitness reports can vary wildly from what investigators eventually discover to be true. ""You have to be very careful of what we hear,"" he said. For example, a tweet surfaced Thursday night that incorrectly named a missing Brown University student as one of the suspects, citing police scanners as the source. The missing student's family temporarily took down a Facebook page asking for help finding him after being bombarded by negative comments. In this way, an incorrect tweet can take on a life of its own as it is quickly retweeted and quoted. Any subsequent correction is seen only by people following that original person. Even with these challenges, Blanton has found that many agencies are happy to have people following the nonsensitive channels. A number of departments even share their official feeds with Broadcastify. ""On the law enforcement side, they welcome public involvement; more eyes and ears on the ground,"" Blanton said. ""A lot of agencies see the benefit of making available what they do.""","Police scanner streams and Twitter accounts saw traffic surge during events in Boston .
Experts warn that chatter on police feeds can be misleading and not always true .

"(CNN) -- After a one-year hiatus, the New York City Marathon returned Sunday with a different priority: security. It went off without a hitch as 47,000 runners raced through five boroughs and passed cheering crowds. Last year's marathon was canceled because of damage from Superstorm Sandy. Police were especially focused on security in part because of April's bombings at the Boston Marathon, which left three people dead and more than 260 injured. At least 1,500 cameras were positioned along the route to help boost security, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. There were baggage screenings and surveillance helicopters. Runners were screened and inspected before taking their starting positions, according to police.. Bomb-sniffing dogs and scuba divers scanned bridges and shorelines. Counterterrorism officers escorted ferries carrying runners. Priscah Jeptoo of Kenya won the marathon's women's division with an official time of 2:25:07. On the men's side, Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya won with an official time of 2:08:24. Each will get $100,000 in prize money. Opinion: How running can change the world . In New York, spectators watching from grandstands and family reunion areas were subject to baggage inspections and screenings as a precaution. ""The safety of runners and spectators has always been our highest priority,"" New York Road Runners, the organizers of the event, said in a statement. Runners took it in stride. Months after Boston bombings: Sense of winning for amputee . ""It will obviously cause some problems for us, but that doesn't matter,"" said Runar Gundersen, who was to run his 35th New York Marathon this year. ""Security must come first, so I gladly accept delays. ... I think most runners do."" Organizers said a lot of additional security measures will be taking place in the background. ""I know that it's impossible to protect 26.2 miles of road 100%,"" Gundersen said. ""The feeling about that is much like it was in 2001 after 9/11.""

"(CNN) -- What level of privacy will we have online in the future? Will people share their personal data freely in exchange for more customized service? Or will they become fiercely protective of private information, using tools and browsers that protect their identity from advertisers and other third parties? Privacy experts from Facebook, Google, Mozilla and Microsoft have been tackling these big questions this week at the RSA security conference in San Francisco. Public changes to privacy policies, like the ones that make news when Facebook or Google change their settings, are just a small part of the story. Behind the scenes, these companies have full-time staffs of privacy experts, lawyers and engineers who are juggling an array of privacy demands. In addition to what the users expect, there are government regulations, industry standards and rules that vary across operating systems. Companies that provide free services, such as search engines or social networks, have to strike the right balance between respecting their customers' privacy concerns and serving advertisers. ""It's important and easy for everyone to acknowledge that much of the incredible growth of the Internet today has been fueled by advertising,"" said Keith Enright, Google's senior privacy counsel. ""I believe that will continue to be true."" For Web titans, the money still flows in from advertisers, not consumers. Facebook made $4.2 billion, or 84% of its revenue, from online advertising in 2012. Google saw $43.6 billion in advertising last year, accounting for almost 95% of the company's revenue. Customers' leverage . They may not be paying for the services directly, but customers still have a lot of power -- and companies know that they need to listen. People can switch to another browser, ditch Facebook and go back to writing e-mails, stop Googling and start Binging. And privacy is becoming more and more important to them. ""Privacy is increasingly becoming a feature,"" said Brendon Lynch, Microsoft's chief privacy officer. The customer demand for stronger data controls led to the introduction of the ""do not track"" feature. ""Do not track"" is a setting that can be now found on all the major browsers: Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari. When turned on, it asks sites not to track that person's online activities. A Microsoft survey found that 75% of people were concerned about online tracking and thought the setting should be turned on by default. ""Do not track"" seems like a clear, smart option to give consumers, but it has has been difficult to enforce. There are talks under way by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international organization that develops standards for the Web, to make it official. However, advertisers and other third parties are pushing back. Changes to consumers' data, like ""do not track,"" can come at the expense of advertisers, creating friction. When Mozilla recently announced that it was testing a feature that disabled third-party cookies by default in its Firefox browser, the general counsel for the Interactive Advertising Bureau called it ""a nuclear first strike"" against the ad industry on Twitter. ""We can't just sit back and allow the industry to just continue to ignore a core component of the user experience online,"" said Alex Fowler, Mozilla's global privacy and public policy leader. The issues will become only more complex in the future, when small sensors and devices that can track things like location, fitness and environment become ubiquitous. The more devices that connect to the Internet, from smart cars to home thermostats, the more data there are about a person to collect. Location data are already being tagged on to photos, tweets and other online actions when people use their mobile phones. For many people, they are considered private data, whether they show where someone is at that exact moment or where they've been over time. ""How can you take the data, make it less sensitive but still make it of value to the user?"" asked Lynch. Balancing privacy and usefulness . According to the panelists, personal data such as location have many potentially positive uses, for individuals as well as advertisers. Consider the wealth of location-based tools already in use, such as food recommendations, social apps and dating services. There will probably be future options that strike a balance between sharing information and cutting off all data. Not everyone will want the same level of privacy, so options and customization will have to be made available. People could share their location information on a case-by-case basis but still stay anonymous. They might choose to have a persistent anonymous ID for location-based services, so that their location history and other data can be used without connecting them to a specific person. It's also possible that over the next five to 10 years, people's attitudes toward privacy and their data will change, and they'll be willing to share more personal information, attached to their real-world identity, in exchange for more heavily customized computing experiences. ""You don't want to punish the user who cares about privacy by saying, 'Give it up or don't participate,' "" Fowler said. For the people who don't want to share at all, one option floated at the panel was to charge for the services and jettison the ads. This kind of either/or option is popping up in the mobile-app world and with services like Pandora. Free versions come with ads, but for a price, people can upgrade to the ad-free experience. A paid subscription option is unlikely to come to the big services people are used to getting for free, such as Facebook. Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, said that one of the chief requests from users is that the company never charge for the service. The lengthy privacy policies, thick with legalese, that most services use now will never go away, but better controls will probably emerge. Whatever the tools are used to protect and collect personal data in the future, it will be important for companies like Facebook and Google to educate their consumers and to provide them with options for all levels of privacy.","Companies like Facebook and Google must balance advertiser and customer data demands .
All major browsers now offer a ""do not track"" setting, but it is difficult to enforce .
Privacy settings will probably become more customizable and easier to understand ."
"(CNN) -- With Lionel Messi on the sidelines, Neymar took center stage in the battle with Cristiano Ronaldo for the crown of La Liga's most influential player on Saturday. Ronaldo's injury-time heroics prevented Real Madrid from falling eight points behind in the title race ahead of the international break, as the Portugal forward scored a last-gasp winner against Levante. Barcelona had no such problems, despite also going behind at home to Valladolid, with Gerardo Martino's team running out a 4-1 victor for eight wins out of eight. Alexis Sanchez scored two of those goals, but it was his fellow South American Neymar who ran the show -- scoring the last himself, setting up one for the Chilean and providing the spark for Xavi's strike that made it 2-1. With Messi recovering from a second injury this season, Neymar has been given an increasing amount of responsibility following his $75 million move from Santos and is showing he can fit into the role of team player as well as solo star. However, it was Sanchez who responded to Javi Guerra's 10th-minute opener, firing in a superb equalizer from outside the penalty area. Neymar's burst helped Cristian Tello to set up midfield veteran Xavi for his second goal this season, then the Brazilian slid a perfect pass for Sanchez to slot home in the 64th minute. The roles were reversed on 70 as Sanchez squared the ball to Neymar, who turned and fired in a low shot for his second league goal since arriving. Ronaldo took his La Liga tally to seven, one behind Messi and Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa, as he blasted the decisive goal in Real's 3-2 win at Levante. Real twice came from behind to deny the home side, which led through Baba Diawara in the 57th minute and then Nabil El Zhar with four to play in regulation. Captain Sergio Ramos leveled the first time, stabbing in at the far post from a corner, and 20-year-old substitute Alvaro Morata made it 2-2 before Ronaldo's deflected shot went in off the post in the fourth added minute. Coach Carlo Ancelotti had made several changes following the midweek Champions League win over Copenhagen, in which Ronaldo and Angel Di Maria both scored twice, and the Italian was again without injured marquee signing Gareth Bale. Real went two points above fourth-placed Villarreal, which beat Granada 3-0 on Friday. Second-placed Atletico will seek to keep a perfect record in Sunday's home clash with Celta Vigo. Meanwhile, Bayern Munich claimed top spot in Germany for the first time this season despite dropping points for the first time in a 1-1 draw at third-placed Bayer Leverkusen. The European and Bundesliga champion will end the weekend with a one-point advantage over Leverkusen and previous leader Borussia Dortmund -- which crashed 2-0 at Borussia Monchengladbach. Bayern's last league loss was 33 games ago at Leverkusen, and Pep Guardiola's team seemed on track for a seventh win from eight this season after Toni Kroos scored on the half hour. However, Sidney Sam leveled immediately and goalkeeper Bernd Leno kept out a barrage of attempts by the Bavarians. Dortmund crumbled after Germany defender Mats Hummels was sent off in the 81st minute for hauling down Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit -- Max Kruse converted the resulting penalty and Brazilian strike partner Raffael doubled the lead. Gladbach moved up to fourth on goal difference above Hannover, held 1-1 by Hertha Berlin on Friday. Seventh-placed Stuttgart and Werder Bremen drew 1-1 to be on 11 points along with Schalke, which beat Augsburg 4-1. Roma moved five points clear at the top in Italy after crushing fourth-placed Inter Milan 3-0, despite having a player sent off at the San Siro. The capital club made it seven wins from seven as veteran Francesco Totti scored a double and Alessandro Florenzi also found the net before halftime. Totti smashed in from Gervinho's layoff then converted a disputed penalty after the Ivory Coast international was brought down in the box. Florenzi was set up by Kevin Strootman just before the break, and Roma could afford to lose defender Federico Balzaretti at the end for a second yellow card as the home side suffered a first defeat under former Napoli coach Walter Mazzarri. Atalanta earlier moved up to eighth place with a 1-0 win at struggling Chievo. In France, Monaco went three points clear of Paris Saint-Germain following Saturday's 2-1 win at home to Saint-Etienne, with substitute Lucas Ocampos scoring an 87th-minute decider.

"(CNN) -- One French tennis star kept alive his hopes of a long-awaited return to the ATP World Tour Finals on Tuesday, but another has missed out on a third successive appearance. Jo-Wilfried was the 2011 runner-up at the men's season-ending tournament, but he will not be part of the eight-man line-up in London next month after blowing two match-points against Kei Nishikori in the second round of the Paris Masters. Tsonga was ranked a career-high fifth last year, but has dropped to 10th in the standings after sitting out big chunks of this season due to injury. The 28-year-old raced to victory in the opening set against Nishikori but then lost two tie-breakers against the world No. 19 as he went down 1-6 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (9-7). ""I believe he managed well, because I could have won that match,"" Tsonga said of Nishikori, who beat France's Julien Benneteau in his opening match. ""He was very solid, especially during the important moments. ""I really have to improve my physical condition. I have to work a lot and very hard during the break. But if I'm able to play very solid matches like I played for the first set, it's going to be good."" Tsonga led 6-5 in the decider but double-faulted, then Nishikori saved himself at 7-6 down with an ace. The first Japanese man to reach the fourth round of the French Open since 1938, he will next take on another player from the host country of this tournament -- Richard Gasquet -- on Thursday. With world No. 3 Andy Murray sidelined by injury for the rest of this year, ninth-ranked Gasquet holds the last place for London as he bids for his first qualification since his 2007 finals debut in Shanghai. He wasted two match-points in the second set against Fernando Verdasco on Tuesday but fought back to beat the Spaniard 7-5 6-7 (6-7) 6-3 in a match lasting two hours and 41 minutes. ""I felt bad,"" Gasquet said. ""I had two match points and I was close to winning the match. There was a tie-break after that, and I thought it was very tough to lose that second set.

"(CNN) -- Richie Incognito considered fellow offensive lineman Jonathan Martin a ""little brother,"" Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill said Wednesday, saying the team was caught off-guard by Martin's accusations of misconduct against his teammate. Neither player is with the team now; Martin left abruptly last week after an incident in the team cafeteria and Incognito was suspended on Sunday after Martin's representatives reportedly turned over voice mails and texts with racial slurs and threats of violence to the Dolphins and the NFL. But, while they were with the team, the two were good friends. At least in Tannehill's mind. ""I think if you had asked Jon Martin a week before who his best friend on the team was, he would have said Richie Incognito,"" the quarterback told reporters. ""The first guy to stand up for Jonathan if anything went down on the field, any kind of tussle, Richie was the first guy there. When they wanted to hang out ... outside of football, who was together: Richie and Jonathan. So I can't, I'm not in those guys' shoes. I can't explain what's going on."" Tannehill, a second-year quarterback, said Martin was a quiet guy who made a few jokes but was mostly business. His demeanor remained the same even up to the night he left the team after other players played a prank on him in the dining hall. ""There were no warning signs,"" he said. Tannehill said he had exchanged recent texts with Martin, once on the night the offensive tackle left and then on Friday, the day after the Dolphins beat the Bengals. ""I miss being out there,"" Martin said, according to Tannehill. The entertainment show omg! Insider talked to Martin's father on Wednesday. ""He's a strong man. He's doing fine,"" Gus Martin said. The league office is investigating Martin's claims of misconduct. On Wednesday, Commissioner Roger Goodell chose Ted Wells to lead the inquiry. Wells also participated in an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment at Syracuse in 2012 and one that led to a change in the head of the NBA players union earlier this year. ""He has an impeccable reputation and we look forward to fully cooperating with the review,"" Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said in a written statement. ""We take this situation seriously. As the owner, I am committed to creating a professional environment for all of the members of the Dolphins family."" Dolphins coach Joe Philbin repeated his assertion that he will institute change if the NFL report finds his staff at fault. ""If the review reveals anything that needs to be corrected we will take all necessary measures to fix it, to ensure that this doesn't happen again,"" he said. Philbin said he had no comment on a report in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that Dolphins coaches asked Incognito to help toughen up Martin, a 24-year-old second-year player. ""Jonathan Martin came in here and worked hard every single day,"" he said in response to a followup question. The team hasn't met to discuss the situation, Tannehill said, but it was widely discussed the first few days by players in the cafeteria and in the locker room. The allegations of bullying and racially charged language were ""mind-blowing"" to the team, he said. As a quarterback and a team leader he would have done something if he saw something that crossed the line, he said. No one knew there was a situation to be stopped, he added. Incognito, a nine-year veteran, treated Martin like a ""little brother."" ""He gave him a hard time, he messed with him, but he was the first one there to have his back in any situation,"" Tannehill said. Offensive tackle Tyson Clabo said the two were ""thick as thieves."" ""They went out together, they hung out together,"" he said. ""They did a lot of stuff together, so if (Martin) had a problem with the way that (Incognito) was treating him, he had a funny way of showing it."" Incognito, 30, has only said a few words since he was suspended. ""You know, I'm just trying to weather the storm right now. And this will pass,"" he told CNN affiliate WSVN outside a doctor's office in Weston, Florida, on Tuesday. Incognito said he didn't want to comment on media reports that he sent Martin voice mails containing racial slurs and threats of physical violence. When asked about his status with the team, Incognito closed the door to his BMW without answering and drove away. ESPN, NFL.com and other media outlets reported that representatives for Martin on Sunday submitted the voice mails and texts to the league and the Dolphins. One of the messages, from April, contained a reference to Martin's biracial background, according to ESPN's sources. ""Hey, wassup, you half (expletive) piece of (expletive). I saw you on Twitter, you been training 10 weeks. I'll (expletive) in your (expletive) mouth. I'm gonna slap your (expletive) mouth, I'm gonna slap your real mother across the face (laughter). (Expletive) you, you're still a rookie. I'll kill you."" Martin remains on the team's roster while Incognito is on the suspended list.

"(CNN) -- High-intensity training can often be a cruel master -- capable of provoking a mixture of sweat and tears, as well as occasional mishap and mental frailty -- but how much worse must it be when knowing that the worst part comes at the end? That's when an exhausted athlete, after hours of physical exertion, has to clamber into a vat of iced water -- perhaps giving new meaning to the phrase 'on the rocks'. During her heyday, Paula Radcliffe, who still holds the world record for the marathon she ran in 2003, revealed how she dreaded the baths, which the Briton termed ""absolute agony"". So Radcliffe may have mixed emotions about a recent report which pours cold water on the efficacy of a concept already quite literally swimming in the stuff. The European Journal of Sports Science suggests the benefits of the ice bath -- a technique which has been used in numerous sports disciplines (track-and-field, soccer, NFL, cricket, rugby and tennis to name but a few) -- are highly questionable. More worryingly still, the scientists who led an experiment into cold water immersion at the University of Portsmouth suggest the practice could be a ""possible threat to people's health"" as well. In theory, the recovery device -- whose by-products include a whole lot of gnashing, squealing and wailing -- is thought to reduce inflammation, swelling, muscle spasms and pain but the benefits have been disputed by the scientists on England's south coast. Their test involved 40 athletes undertaking an hour and a half of intermittent shuttle running before being split into four groups for the recovery period: with 10 standing in cold water, 10 standing in warm water and 10 simply walking slowly -- all over a 12-minute period -- while the final group sat in cold water for just two minutes. Measuring muscle performance before exercise and at frequent intervals in the days afterwards, the scientists found ""no differences ... between any of the groups in terms of athletes' perception of pain or in their biochemical markers of muscle cell damage."" Health Risks . So while not only querying the fundamental validity of the process, lead author Jo Corbett also highlights the possibility that the intended recovery aid could -- rather than prove beneficial -- actually take an athlete out of action instead. ""Possible health risks of cold water immersion include hyperventilation leading to metabolic alkalosis [an acid-based disturbance] and, in rare cases, impaired consciousness,"" Corbett told CNN. ""There is also some evidence of a reduction in cerebral artery blood flow, which at very cold water temperatures can cause syncope [fainting] characterized by drowsiness, blurred vision, and a loss of responsiveness in some individuals."" Other possible health risks of ice baths, according to Dr Corbett, include tachycardia [a fast heart beat], arrhythmias [abnormal heart beats], allergic and anaphylactic shock as well as the development of non-freezing cold injury [a tissue damage similar to, but lacking the severity of, frostbite]. In theory, both arrhythmias and anaphylactic shock can have fatal consequences -- so it's no surprise that Dr Corbett would like to see more tests into ice baths, even if it must be stressed that no athlete has yet to suffer in such fashion despite their popularity. ""The prevalence of these risks will likely depend on the way that the immersion is used -- which is why there needs to be a clear understanding of the mechanisms of action of cold water immersion. ""The frequency of these symptoms in healthy, asymptomatic individuals is not clear but may be very low."" Placebo effect . Before athletes around the world gain an added spring to their step at the thought of throwing out the bath water, Corbett advises that the conclusions of his team's study should not be set in stone-- ""particularly when there is evidence for and against [ice baths],"" he says. Nonetheless, some leading clubs have already been in touch since the report's publication to pursue further detail on the findings. In Australia, the Head of Human Performance at leading football side Sydney FC admits that even though confusion may reign over the longevity of cold water immersion, given the differing scientific opinions, he does not foresee the end of this ice age. ""I have learned throughout my career that if a player thinks it works, it probably does,"" Dr Craig Duncan, told CNN. ""The placebo affect in sport is significant and if you combine that with a good performance, it will become a major part of a player's preparation. This is so for recovery and the feedback I get from players [about ice baths] is: . -My muscles feel less sore . -I don't feel as heavy, my legs feel lighter . -I feel refreshed . -It's just what I like to do . -I do it because Craig says I have to . Alternatively, if I find a player really gets stressed about it, then there really is no point as I think it will have little positive effect."" Given this viewpoint, the players at Sydney FC, where former Italy international Alessandro del Piero is playing following his recent move from Juventus, may do well to remind Dr Duncan of his failsafe methods of recovery. ""Recovery is a massive area with many different views but we can never get away from the fact that the two key ingredients to positive recovery are Good Sleep and Sound Nutrition,"" he says. So a nice feed followed by a warm bed -- or being immersed into an iced bath -- to recover. Hmmm, let me think...","Leading report questions how efficient the use of ice baths is for leading athletes .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- The nautical blue paint spelling out ""Costa Concordia"" has almost all bubbled and chipped off the bow of the once luxurious cruise liner after 20 months under salt water off the Italian island of Giglio. One can get glimpse of just what it's like in and under the Concordia by the vast array of mesmerizing underwater videos released by Italy's coast guard and the Titan Micoperi salvage team tasked with removing the rusting hulk. The seabed is still littered with sun deck chairs that floated from the ship's balconies and upper deck when it finally came to a rest in January 2012. Fish swim around the sunbed legs and seaweed has grown through some of the mesh seating. The beds are spread out in a surreal scene that looks like a set from an underwater science fiction film. Shoes, mattresses, dinner plates and thousands of pieces of cutlery shimmer in the divers' lights on a bed of sea grass. INTERACTIVE: How the 952-foot wreck will be raised . Divers have not been deep inside the massive ship for nearly a year. The salvage divers only work on the outside of the ship and do not have authority to enter the vessel, with the exception of a work area they have created with a false floor on the upper port side deck, unless accompanied by Coast Guard divers. Not only is the Concordia still chock full of passengers' possessions the Costa Cruises company hopes to return, but the ship is still considered a crime scene. Thirty-two people died in the accident and the ship's erstwhile captain, Francesco Schettino, is facing charges of multiple manslaughter and causing the shipwreck after piloting the 290-meter ship into the rocks on Giglio last year. The last divers to comb through the Concordia's sunken bowels were there to search in vain for the last two victims, still believed to be trapped somewhere under the ship or buried in a watery grave at the bottom of the hollow hull. The salvage crew believe they know about where the bodies might be found, but there is no guarantee until the ship is lifted whether they will be found at all. In the weeks after the accident, the divers called the inside of the ship a ""toxic stew"" of spilled oil, rotting food and floating tableware. There were five massive restaurants on the ship -- each one in operation when the ship crashed at 9:42 p.m. on January 13, 2013, spilling tables of buffet food into the water. More than a dozen kitchens and freezers had enough food to feed the 4,200 passengers and crew for a week, plus extra supplies that all cruise ships carry in case of emergencies and delays. Many of the freezers burst and their contents were gobbled up by sea life and the colony of sea gulls that has multiplied on the island since the disaster. Fishermen off Giglio say that the fish have changed, too. They are much larger and harder to catch after gorging on the ship's offerings. The freezers that have not burst under the water pressure are still locked with their rotting thawed contents sealed inside. Fridges too, filled with milk, cheese, eggs and vegetables, have been closed tight since the disaster. One has to only imagine leaving a home freezer -- a fraction of the size of the industrial freezers used by cruise ships -- unplugged for 20 months to get an idea of the type of rancid mess trapped inside. Rodolfo Raiteri, head of the Coast Guard dive team, told CNN that his divers had to confront an array of deep-sea threats, from floating knives to lethal bed sheets and flowing curtains that could have easily become entangled in the divers' safety cords. There were also floating chairs and large chunks of marble and crystal chandeliers that constantly detached and fell from the sideways ship's ceilings every time the ship creaked and shifted as it settled onto two underwater rocky mountain peaks. All that debris, along with thousands of dinner plates, can be seen stacked against the underwater windows in some of the salvage video. The ship has compressed three full meters in the 20 months since it crashed, and each time it groans and twists, windows break as their frames adjust and once-attached items are lodged free. On cruise ships, dining room tables are all affixed to the floors to keep passengers from chasing sliding tables in rough seas. Raiteri described the bizarre scene his divers faced swimming among the sideways tables, sometimes encountering plates of food and floating champagne bottles in their search for victims. Senior cabin service director Manrico Giampedroni, one of the last survivors to be pulled out of the wreckage alive, became trapped half submerged in the ship's dining room when his leg got caught among fallen furniture. He survived for 36 hours on floating food and stayed awake by drinking caffeinated beverages until rescuers found him. If he had fallen asleep, he would have drowned. Incidentally, Giampedroni was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter in a plea bargain for his role in the deaths for not being at his duty station to help evacuate the ship. In addition to the general rule of thumb that you don't blow up ships where there are still unrecovered victims, one of the main reasons the Concordia is being refloated rather than blown up or dismantled on site is because of the toxins and personal effects still trapped in the ship's 1,500 staterooms. The ship's engines are still thick with lubricants and the kitchens are still filled with cooking oils and non-soluble materials that would pollute the sea. Giglio, which lies within the Pelagos Sanctuary, the largest protected marine wildlife park in the Mediterranean, is flush with exotic sea life and coral reefs. The putrid stew inside the ship's 17 deck-structure will eventually have to be purified or pumped out before the ship is refloated sometime next year, and the personal effects are another matter. All that was in the Concordia the moment it wrecked is presumably still there, save the ship's bell, which mysteriously disappeared two months after the wreck based on surveillance video taken by authorized divers. An investigation into who could have stolen the bell has caused some concern that other items, especially high price items from the ship's gift shops, could have also been pilfered. Everything inside the ship is expected to be recovered and returned to its original owners, no matter how water-logged it may be, but that could be months from now when the ship is eventually towed and dry docked for dismantling. Each of the cabins has a locked safe, presumably still filled with passengers' valuables including cash and jewelry. There are also countless cameras, laptops, iPads and cellphones that passengers left behind, not to mention luggage. The ship had only been at sail for three hours, so many passengers likely didn't take time to unpack, but instead headed to the nearest dining room or bar to relax as the ship set sail. One suitcase floated to the nearby island of Elba and its soggy contents were delivered to the owner nine months after the disaster. Many more suitcases have been spotted by divers at the bottom of the sea. Nick Sloane, the head of the salvage operation for Titan Micoperi, the joint American-Italian venture to rescue the Concordia,, says that if explosives were used, the ship's smaller contents would become dangerous projectiles. ""Mattresses and passports would scatter the sea,"" he says. But the real danger would be flying cutlery, cooking knives, bottles and broken glass. If the ""parbuckling"" goes well and the giant 114,000-ton vessel is tipped upright sometime in the next week, much more than the 65 percent of the ship that is under water now will be submerged. The platforms that will provide a base on which the Concordia will rest are some 30 meters below the sea level, meaning many of the staterooms that were dry until now will sink underwater. Some of the toxic water will be displaced and pushed out of the upper cabins. Some freezers that are still sealed could burst under new water pressure. And almost every window on the ship's outer cabins is expected to break as the ship's frame twists. Sloane says the noise will be deafening as metal twists and windows pop. The ship has been rigged with cameras and microphones to help the salvage crew monitor the ship's structure as it is lifted. As Sloane says, ships this size were never meant to lie on their sides, and they are not built to be lifted. The salvage team says they will be able to contain any spillage of toxins with oil booms now in place around the work site. The broken glass and new debris will join what is already at the bottom of the sea. There will never be the scale of environmental disaster that was already averted by removing the ship's 2,400 tons of fuel shortly after the ship crashed, but there are still major risks involved with salvaging the Concordia. If the parbuckling fails and the ship breaks apart as it is rotated, the rotten contents -- moldy mattresses, passports, toxic stew and all -- will spill into the once-pristine sea. And even if it succeeds, this part of the Mediterranean will never be quite the same again.","Costa Concordia ran aground off Giglio in January 2012, killing 32 people .

"Zurich, Switzerland (CNN) -- No decision will be made on a shift in the date for soccer's Qatar 2022 World Cup before the 2014 World Cup is played, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said Friday. There has been controversy around plans to stage the 2022 contest in Qatar's intense summer heat, prompting calls to move the tournament to the winter. It had been expected ahead of the executive committee, or ExCo, meeting that a decision on whether to shift the tournament from Qatar's summer to the winter months would come Friday. But the executive committee for football's world governing body, which has met over the past two days in Zurich, has ""decided to launch a consultation process among main stakeholders for Qatar 2022 dates,"" Blatter said via his official Twitter account. At a news conference in Zurich, Blatter also said that Qatar ""needs to intervene"" after allegations of abuse of migrant laborers working on infrastructure projects for the 2022 tournament -- and that the Gulf state has said it will act. ""This is not FIFA's first responsibility, but we cannot ignore it, and it touches me. But it is not an intervention by FIFA that is going to change something. It is Qatar that needs to intervene, and Qatar has confirmed to me that they are going to do it,"" he said. Qatar has provided a letter setting out what ministers have already started to do, he said. The delay in announcing a decision on changing the dates for the contest will allow FIFA time for broader consultations on the issue with key stakeholders, such as players, clubs, national football associations and TV broadcasters who pay huge sums for the rights to the games. Blatter said it would also mean the 2014 World Cup in Brazil could be played without being overshadowed by questions over Qatar. Blatter: Doubts over heat . Blatter stressed that there is no possibility of taking the 2022 World Cup away from Qatar, as some critics have demanded. He plans to visit Qatar with members of the executive committee to see how the preparations are going, as well as to meet with Qatar's new emir, he said. Asked about remarks last month in which he said FIFA may have made a mistake in choosing Qatar for the 2022 World Cup back in 2010, Blatter said his words did not relate to the choice of location. ""The mistake was to think that we could play this competition easily in the summertime,"" he said. ""There are some doubts as to whether it is a good period to play in this heat."" He acknowledged that FIFA ""could have made this declaration that it is too hot a little bit earlier"" but said there is still plenty of time before the tournament is played. 'Irresponsible' Earlier Friday, FIFA Vice President Jeffrey Webb said, ""I don't think there should be a decision today. We definitely have not been presented with an analysis. We don't know where the stakeholders are, so I think it would be irresponsible for us to take a decision today."" The World Cup is usually played in the northern hemisphere's summer months, but concerns have been raised over the safety of players and football fans in Qatar, given that temperatures in July can soar to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 Celsius). All 54 member associations of UEFA, Europe's governing body, last month voted against holding the tournament in the Qatari summer. But a winter World Cup would cause chaos with the European domestic season, with many clubs fearing that they could lose out financially. The secretary general for the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee, Hassan al-Thawadi, delivered a progress report Thursday to FIFA's ExCo on the Gulf nation's preparations for the event. Al-Thawadi has said that innovative cooling technologies will ensure that conditions are not too hot for visitors during the tournament. The Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee has also said it is committed to ensuring workers' safety and well-being. The Qatar conundrum . Ali Al Khulaifi, an international relations adviser at Qatar's Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, said this week that Qatar is taking concrete steps to ensure that its labor rules are enforced, including making it easier for workers to report abuses by their employers.

"(CNN) -- Rail experts Tuesday questioned the effectiveness of one step being taken by New York's Metro-North Railroad to ensure safety one week after the derailment of a speeding commuter train killed four people and injured dozens of others. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the railroad, said late Sunday that ""alerter"" systems -- which require engineers to respond to alerts, sound an alarm if they are unresponsive and eventually brake the train in an emergency-- will be installed in every operator cab within the next year. Currently, such systems in the engineer's position are present in two-thirds of the railroad's fleet. The Hudson line train that derailed on December 1 had an alerter system in the engine car at the rear but not in the front cab, where the engineer apparently nodded off at the controls as the train approached a curve at 82 miles per hour. The engineer's lawyer and union representatives said the train's hypnotic motion may have caused him to nod off -- a case of what the lawyer termed ""highway hypnosis."" Man vs. machine: Who should be at the wheel? Steven Harrod, a University of Dayton professor and expert on railway operations, said the effectiveness of ""alerter"" systems is debatable. ""It's not the cure all for all problems,"" he told CNN. ""Research has been done showing that some crews are adapting to these 'alerters' and they're still sleeping to the 'alerters.' It's that whole highway hypnosis thing."" A 2007 study of ""alerter"" technology by Massachusetts Institute of Technology said, ""Engineers can become inattentive and keep hitting the alerter even when nodding off. 'Alerter naps' has become a commonly used term."" The study cited a 2006 National Transportation Safety Board investigation report on a freight train collision in Macdona, Texas, in which escaping liquified chlorine ultimately killed the conductor and two local residents. The study said the engineer experienced what it called ""alerter naps"" in which he ""apparently drifted in and out of micro-sleep."" ""I view the alerter devices as being only partially effective,"" Steven Ditmeyer, a former Federal Railroad Administration official who teaches at Michigan State University, said in an e-mail. ""During my years in the railroad industry, there have been numerous occasions when locomotive engineers have responded to alerter alarms while being in less than a fully conscious state."" While two-thirds of Metro-North's operating fleet is equipped with alerters in the engineer's position, the remaining one-third is equipped with ""dead man"" controls, another safety measure which theoretically requires the conductor make continuous conscious input to keep the train running. At the time of the accident, the train was in ""push mode,"" meaning that the locomotive was in the rear of the train pushing it along the tracks, with engineer William Rockefeller in a cabin at the front operating it remotely. His cabin was equipped with a ""dead man pedal"" that required constant downward pressure with the foot to keep the train moving, the MTA has said. The dead man pedal was working properly, authorities said. The newer model locomotive in the rear, however, was equipped with an alerter system which sounds a tone every 25 seconds, requiring the engineer to respond with a tap within 15 seconds while the train is in steady motion. Late Sunday, the MTA said it was taking additional safety measures: Signal crews installed new protections at the bend near the Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx -- where the fatal derailment occurred -- to warn engineers of the speed reduction and automatically apply emergency brakes if speed is not lowered to 30 mph. By Tuesday morning, the MTA said, Metro-North also enhanced communication between engineers and conductors to ensure trains are operated at safe speeds at four other critical curves and five movable bridges. Conductors will stand with engineers at the control cab through the critical curves or they will communicate by radio. On Monday, the NTSB continued to rule out mechanical causes in a deadly crash while adding to the possibility that human error was involved. The NTSB said it has completed its inspection of the train and found no anomalies. The board found no problems with speed sensors, the brake control unit or the train's propulsion controller. At 7:11 a.m. that Sunday -- about 11 minutes before the derailment -- the engineer did not dim the train's headlights as required when it passed another train, the NTSB said Monday. It also said it believes that positive train control, a costly, high-tech system that targets human error, could have prevented the crash. The safety board has pushed the system for about 20 years. Congress is requiring most major railroads, including Metro-North, to install the costly systems by the end of 2015. David Rangel, an instructor at the Modoc Railroad Academy in Marion, Illinois, advocates putting another person in the engineer's cab of commuter trains, a practice that is common in freight trains and airplane cockpits. ""It will increase the cost, of course, but the alternative that the railroads are looking at, and the federal government is trying to force on the railroads, positive train control, is certainly much more costly,"" Rangel told CNN. ""We're into the hundreds of millions of dollars right now and we haven't even had the implementation of that system. ... The problem here is that we are dealing with humans in the cabs of those locomotives and we have frailties.""","Rail experts question a step taken to make trains safer after Metro-North wreck .

"(CNN) -- It's Halloween, and I'm here to tell you to scare your kids fearlessly. It's good for them. First, a story. Early last summer, my 9-year-old daughter and I took a trip to Hershey Park. Casey loves roller coasters (we first tackled Great Adventure's Nitro and its blinding 80-mph speed when she was 4). But vertical plunges? No. That day I repeatedly asked her whether she'd like to try Fahrenheit, a coaster that (egad) ascends 121 feet before plummeting down a (double egad) 97-degree drop. She'd shake her head, ""No."" Once she overcame the fear and took the plunge, I thought, genuine euphoria would ensue. Finally, I made an offer. ""Casey,"" I said, ""if you go on Fahrenheit, I'll let you play three games and buy you a soda (banned in our household). ""OK,"" she said, gulping. ""I'll do it."" When the attendant locked down the protective bar, tears appeared. ""I don't want to do this,"" she said. More tears. ""Daddy, I don't want to do this."" Onlookers began to stare. ""Honey, are you OK?"" an employee asked. ""Do you need to get off?"" ""Nooooo,"" Casey said, still crying. ""No."" The ride started to move. Up. Up. Up. Straight up, staring into the blue Pennsylvania sky. ""Daddy, noooooooo,"" Casey wailed. ""Daddy, I can't do this ... Daddddddddyyyyyyyyy ..."" I was the worst father in history. We began our steep downward plunge. I turned to look at Casey. She was grinning, ear to ear. ""Whoooooooooooooooo!"" she screamed. ""This! Is! Awesome! This! Is! Awesome!"" It was. As yet another October 31 approaches, I've been thinking a lot about Casey and Fahrenheit and the virtues of a scared tyke. Last weekend, at my children's elementary school, the wife and I organized a Halloween party that included, for the first time, a haunted house. The fare was pretty typical: a man in a Michael Myers mask reaching out toward people, a cemetery filled with zombies, a crazy chef cooking guts and eyeballs. It was held in a dark hallway and despite that was clearly more about fun than fear. Yet one after another, parents questioned me about whether their 6-to-11-year-old tykes were ready for a fright, whether perhaps being too scared would create some sort of enduring mental impairment that could haunt their dreams (and ruin their Harvard futures). I wasn't merely asked whether the house was scary. I was asked whether Junior could ""handle it."" ""He might flinch a little,"" I'd say. ""But he can handle it."" Some turned away angrily. Others silently walked off. About 400 kids took the plunge. Some cried at the end, but only a few. Truth is, sometimes kids need to be scared. Pushed. Coerced. And forced to try things that might feel uncomfortable or awkward or even terrifying. But, handled right, can also allow them to emerge feeling proud, brave and accomplished. ""Children are resilient by nature,"" said Tammy Regnet, a prevention specialist in the Buffalo, New York, public school system. ""As long as there's some support available, they can bounce back from difficult experiences without much trouble."" In her work, Regnet is part of a team that takes inner-city children to a ropes course in the woods. There's a zipline, and it's high and long and daunting. ""The kids have to be pulled up, and when they're ready to stop they yell out, 'OK, stop now!'"" said Regnet. ""But we always say, 'Are you sure you don't want to go a bit further?' We try and talk them into it, because the goal is to have them experience life. Without crossing a comfort line, that's hard to do."" Are there limitations? Surely, said Vanessa Taback, a psychologist with the Yonkers public school system. In New York parents should already be cued into their kid's emotional readiness. ""It's not about age,"" Taback said. And then there is common sense: ""What you need to be aware of is what's developmentally appropriate. Blood and guts flying out from the ceiling atop a 6-year old probably isn't the best thing."" Then again, she said, ""At least if a parent is there, it can explained and grasped. Children can be very concrete. So they need an outlet to discuss these things. Haunted houses can be a lot of fun for young kids. So can Halloween. But it's valuable to have an adult nearby."" Halloween is about candy and masks, but it's also about crossing that comfort line: a crazy day when a kid can stroll through a haunted house, ring a doorbell and see the unfamiliar face of someone who gives him or her candy, talk about ghosts and goblins and things that go bump in the night. It should be a little scary; let them handle it. More than ever, parents today seem obsessively determined to do more than merely observe and (if needed) explain. We unnecessarily hold our kids back a year of school in the name of ""getting ahead."" We present every member of every youth team with a season-ending medal, even if they went 0-11 and scored -23 goals. We kick off the school year by demanding principals place our precious darlings with just the right teacher in just the right environment with just the right classmates. We coddle and comfort and make certain no step will be taken without a fluffy pillow to fall back upon. Well, to hell with that. Unless your child is absolutely petrified beyond belief (like, ahem, my son), find the nearest haunted house, plunk down the $20 and take your children for the most frightening little walk of their lives. Then watch as they scream their heads off -- and rave about it right after.

"(CNN) -- South Africa got its Africa Cup of Nations campaign back on track with its first victory in the competition since 2004. The host nation defeated Angola 2-0 in Durban to leave it within touching distance of the quarterfinals following the disappointment of the opening day draw with minnow Cape Verde. On this occasion, Bafana Bafana was far more impressive and goals from defender Siyabonga Sangweni and substitute striker Lehlohonolo Majoro secured the points. Africa Cup of Nations 2013: The teams . South Africa face Morocco on Sunday with only a draw needed to take it through to the next stage. ""I gambled today because it was a must-win situation,"" coach Gordon Igesund told reporters following the win against Angola. ""We had four defenders, one holding midfielder and the other five players were committed to attacking. ""The players believed in themselves -- the nerves that affected us so much against Cape Verde were gone. It was not easy out there on the pitch with the weather so hot."" Cape Verde's 'Special One' Morocco will need to defeat South Africa to guarantee its place in the last-eight after it came from behind to secure a 1-1 draw against Cape Verde. Substitute Youssef El Arabi scored a 78th minute equalizer to deny the Blue Sharks its bid to become the smallest ever nation to win a game at the tournament. Appearing in its first Africa Cup of Nations since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, many expected Cape Verde to struggle on the international stage. But having defeated Cameroon in qualifying and held South Africa to a 0-0 draw in its opening game, Cape Verde's players showed little fear. Fuad Ibrahim eyes Africa Cup of Nations chance . And with 35 minutes on the clock, Ryan Mendes' pass released Platini and the striker produced a wonderfully deft finish to place the ball into the net. That goal looked to have secured a famous victory for Cape Verde but Morocco refused to lie down and with just 12 minutes left, El Arabi popped up to fire home a leveler. ""We made another draw, but we are still alive. I am very happy with this result -- a great one for our country. My players worked very well and proved they have qualities,"" Cape Verde coach Luis Antunes told reporters. The result leaves both teams in with a chance of qualifying having taken two points from the opening two games. Meanwhile, there was bad news for Tunisia after its star striker Issam Jemaa was ruled out of the rest of the tournament with a knee problem.","South Africa wins its first Africa Cup of Nations game in nine years .

"(CNN) -- I had an experience recently that reinvigorated my faith in humanity -- and bureaucracy. I'd left my suitcase in the trunk of a yellow cab in New York City and didn't realize it till 20 minutes later. I did not have a receipt or any way to identify the cab or the driver. I was at the start of a four-day, three-city trip. I was screwed. For almost three hours, various people tried to help me -- two folks at my bank, whose credit card held the only record of the cab ride; three people at two yellow cab companies based in Long Island City; a service rep at the New York City Taxicab & Limousine Commission; people in my office back in Seattle. No luck. As the workday ended, I finally went to the drugstore for some toiletries. My fiancee shipped me some clothes, and I retreated glumly to my hotel room. Then, at 9:48 p.m., Valerie from the TLC called me. She'd been working overtime on my case, used GPS records to identify the cab and located and called the cabbie -- and he still had my bag! He was an African immigrant named George, and he remembered me (or, rather, my crew-cut hair). He hadn't seen my name card under a flap on the backside of the bag and was planning in the morning to ask the TLC to help track me down. I called him -- he was working at his second job. We arranged for him to drop the bag off the next morning. When I thanked Valerie for navigating the system so relentlessly, she insisted she was just doing her job. When I thanked George for his help, he cheerfully said, ""It's the American way!"" My happy-ending story offers a few lessons. One is obvious: Always, always get a receipt. Another is that New Yorkers, contrary to popular belief and their own callous pose, are essentially nice. But the third, even more deeply contrary to popular belief, is that government is not the enemy. Government is not inherently inept. It's simply us -- and as defective or capable of goodness as we are. Today, several weeks into the botched launch of Obamacare's exchanges and several more since the shutdown, the faith of the people in government is weak and weakening further. This trend long predates Obamacare, and its sources are bipartisan. Democrats who favor more active government have tolerated an ever-more complex and impersonal state, while Republicans who want to shrink government love to showcase the breakdowns that complexity -- and GOP-led underfunding -- can bring. What's striking, though, is that both sides have learned to see and speak of government the same way -- as a disembodied thing, a mechanism separate from citizens. Democrats tend to forget and Republicans like to deny the simple reality that government is nothing more than our best attempt to do certain things together that we can't do alone. Like ensure that we are all insured against health catastrophes. Or keep toxic foods out of our babies' mouths. Or send humans to the moon. Or design smart transportation systems on Earth. When government fails, the proper response isn't fatalism; it's activism. The question to ask in the wake of something such as the failure of the healthcare.gov launch isn't why wasn't I better served but rather, what could I do to make it better? To be sure, there are reasons why ""government bureaucracy"" isn't a phrase usually said in gratitude. Three times in my luggage adventure, I was abruptly disconnected from the TLC hotline after being on hold a cumulative 45 minutes. After the third time, I felt disillusioned. Sitting there in the midst of a vast uncaring city, imagining that my bag had been stolen and its contents dispersed, I felt awakened to the hard cold world. But when I got the call from Valerie, that cynicism receded -- and so did the victim-story I'd started to tell myself. Though Valerie was an exceptionally dedicated public employee, she was only part of a web of people -- everyday citizens and workers in government and business -- who'd come together to solve this particular problem. In the scheme of things, that problem and its resolution were utterly insignificant. But they reminded me that we Americans carry an often unspoken privilege -- the privilege of expecting that things should function as promised and that civic institutions should be trustworthy and responsive. This expectation of a working public sphere doesn't prevail in other less healthy societies. My immigrant cabbie George described this willingness to trust, to look out for one another -- to do our part to make complex systems work -- as the American way. But it's only the American way if we make it so. The cardinal rule of citizenship is that society becomes how we behave. If we behave as if the state is there to serve us perfectly or else be eviscerated, we'll get a society where citizens forget how to serve, help, forgive or collaborate. Everyone has some say over whether government does well. Finding that voice and claiming that responsibility feels good -- almost as good as finding a lost suitcase. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Liu.","Eric Liu: I had an experience that gave me more faith in humanity, bureaucracy .

"(CNN) -- From the moment the ancient Greeks held the first Olympics 2,700 years ago, our picture perfect image of elite sportsmen has revolved around the oiled, ripped, macho body. But not all our leading sports stars fit the stereotypical bill of chest-thumping demigods. Some, such as jockeys, instead go to extreme lengths to stunt their growth -- sometimes down to the size of a pre-pubescent child. In an industry where just a few extra pounds can rule you out of a multi-million dollar race, jockeys are put under enormous pressure to meet miniature weight requirements. In the U.S the minimum riding weight is 53kg -- around the average size of a 14 to 15-year-old boy. And for the rider desperate to shed a crucial pound before a competition, one seemingly drastic option may be to purge themselves in a specially designed ""heaving bowl"". It may sound shocking to those outside the racing industry. But the basins installed at U.S. race tracks for vomiting, or ""flipping"" as it is known in the trade, is one of the more extreme dieting methods used by professional jockeys. The use of heaving bowls still remains largely taboo, with 2004 HBO documentary ""Jockey"" causing a stir after it showed footage of the bowls at Churchill Downs race track -- home of the prestigious Kentucky Derby. Retired jockey Jeff Johnston says they are still a regular, if unspoken, sight at many U.S. race tracks. ""It's a square, porcelain bowl with a big hole to flush down the vomit,"" said Johnston, now regional manager for The Jockeys Guild -- the riders' welfare association. ""They're usually in their own cubicle at the end of a line of toilets."" Riders would lose their teeth due to the constant acidic bile, some even to the point of needing dentures. However he added that some of the basins had been removed since he quit riding professionally six years ago. New race tracks also tend not to install them. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association and The Jockeys Guild did not have figures on how many heaving bowls were still in use. Johnston never used the bowls himself, instead relying on strict dieting, saunas and diuretics, known as ""water pills,"" which help the body excrete fluid. ""I wouldn't say heaving bowls are frowned upon within the trade,"" he said, adding: ""Everyone has their own methods of losing weight, but rather than vomiting, I'd say the number one way is still dehydration. It's not uncommon for guys to lose three to four pounds a day in the hot box. ""We're just in the process now of educating jockeys on safe dieting and bringing up minimum weights -- the U.S. is a lot behind Europe in that sense."" Sweat suits, saunas, hot baths and starvation are still very much in use in the racing industry on both sides of the Atlantic, even if there is a growing movement to change it, says Dr Adrian McGoldrick, chief medical officer at the Irish Turf Club, which regulates racing in Ireland. ""The bad old days of extreme dieting methods haven't fully gone by any means,"" he said. ""Starvation is still a very common practice in that the jockey may not eat for 24 hours or more before a race, and combine this with a sauna or hot bath."" Among Irish jockeys, 14% use vomiting as a method for meeting weight requirements, Dr McGoldrick and his team found in a 2011 study into dieting habits. Another 71% admitted to restricting their food intake, while 81% exercise in sweat suits and 86% use saunas. Malnutrition, muscle depletion, decreased blood flow and even depression, were some of the consequences of such rapid weight loss methods, according to Dr McGoldrick. Anna-Louise MacKinnon, medical adviser at the British Professional Jockeys Association (PJA), which promotes the interest of riders in the UK, said there was no evidence small amounts of weight loss -- such as two or three pounds -- was dangerous -- but larger amounts, such as over seven pounds, posed long-lasting health risks. She added that one of the biggest concerns was slower reaction times in dehydrated jockeys. A hungry, dizzy rider on a 450kg horse galloping at 40km, posed a danger to everyone on the track, she said. The PJA is now hoping to raise its minimum weight , currently the lowest in Europe alongside Italy. At 49kg, it's roughly the same size as an average 13-year-old boy. While some jockeys still undertake dangerous crash dieting methods, things have vastly improved in the last ten years, with a new emphasis on education and support services in Britain, Dr McKinnon said. British jockey George Baker, who at 6ft is one of the tallest riders in the game, acknowledges it is a constant struggle sticking to strict diets. The 30-year-old must keep his weight down to 57kg, following a regime of low-calorie meals, hot baths and exercise in sweat suits. For breakfast, Baker will usually have a bowl of cereal and a cup of tea. Lunch consists solely of a piece of fruit and for dinner he will tuck into some steamed chicken and vegetables. ""On a Saturday night I might treat myself to a nice meal -- a starter and a main course,"" he said. ""Mentally, it's very important to have a break now and then."" So why do some jockeys still put themselves through such a punishing, potentially dangerous routine in the pursuit of getting to -- and staying at -- the pinnacle of their sport? ""Some of them just love to ride,"" says Johnston. ""But for others it's a livelihood and they've got a family to support. By whatever means necessary, they've got to keep putting food on the table."" Whether the jockeys themselves will also enjoy that food is a different matter.","The stereotypical image of sportsmen is of bulging six-packs -- except jockeys .

"(CNN) -- A bomb planted in a bicycle killed killed four people and wounded 20 others when it exploded in a busy area of a city in southwestern Pakistan on Wednesday, police said. The explosion took place in Quetta, the capital of the militancy-hit province of Balochistan, said Arif Nawaz, a local police officer. All of those killed were civilians, he said. The perpetrators had planted almost seven kilograms of explosive materials in a bicycle parked in Double Road, one of the busiest areas of Quetta, he said. The target of the blast, which shattered the windows of nearby shops and houses, hasn't yet been established, according to Nawaz. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack. Balochistan has experienced deadly sectarian violence against its Shiite Muslim minority and is also home to separatists who carry out attacks.","Explosives planted in a bicycle go off in a busy area of Quetta .

"(CNN) -- Upon arrival at Kotoka International airport in Ghana's capital city Accra, you are immediately greeted by a sign that says ""Akwaaba,"" which means ""Welcome"" -- and this is exactly how you will feel when visiting this beautiful West African country. A success story of African development, democracy and stability, Ghana is a nation made up of people that are as warm as its climate. Rich in history, culture and natural beauty, it's the perfect introduction to Africa if you are a first-time traveler to the continent, or a great alternative for those who have exhausted the Safari circuit, and crave a different African experience. There is something for everyone in Ghana, ranging from nature trails and UNESCO World Heritage sites to bustling markets, tranquil beaches and vibrant nightlife. Wildlife . There are 15 national parks and reserves across the country. A must see is Kakum National Park, in the central region. The area is covered with stunning tropical rainforest and rare animals, and a long series of hanging bridges known as the Canopy Walkway. Not for the faint hearted, the walkway is located at the forest canopy level, and is secured by a series of nets and wires for safety. The walkway provides tourists with a spectacular vantage point of the beautiful surroundings. Another great place to visit is Ghana's largest wildlife refuge, Mole National Park. The park is located in northwest Ghana, and the park's entrance is reached through the nearby town of Larabanga. It is home to over 93 mammal species, with large mammals including elephants, hippos, buffalo, and warthogs. The park is considered a primary African preserve for numerous antelope species; olive baboons, black-and-white colobus monkeys and the green vervet are among the monkey species resident there. Slender-snouted and dwarf crocodiles are among the 33 known species of reptiles that call this breathtaking park home. Read more: 26 of the most stunning spots in Africa . Heritage . The country became a major economic hub with the emergence of the slave trade, and several slave castles erected by the Europeans in 15th century remain standing. Built by the Portuguese in 1482, Elmina Castle is the oldest remaining slave castle in Africa. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it has become a pilgrimage site, drawing thousands of visitors from around the world -- in particular African-Americans and Caribbean people seeking to connect with their heritage. The town of Elmina surrounding the castle is a vibrant, robust fishing community with an incredible amount of energy and color. Accra . If you don't want to venture far from the capital, there is a lot to do right in Accra. For beach bums, Labadi beach is perfect for soaking up the African sun, and being entertained while you do it. Drumming, cultural dancing and music can all be seen and heard on holidays and during the weekend. Tourists can also visit local cultural attractions such as Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park, W.E.B Dubois Center or head to the Arts Center, where a multitude of stalls sell crafts from all around the country. After a day of relaxing at the beach or visiting the cultural sites, visitors can head to the upscale area of Osu, in central Accra, to sample the nightlife. Locally referred to as the ""West End,"" Osu boasts an impressive number of local and international restaurants offering a range of cuisines. There are also several options for club hoppers and lounge goers. One of the latest additions to nightlife in Accra is Republic Bar and Grill. With indoor and outdoor seating the bar has a retro vibe, and celebrates Ghanaian food, music, culture and art. Republic has a wonderful list of drinks, ranging from cold local beers, to exotic cocktails and herbal teas made with fresh ingredients. The bar also serves a wonderful menu of finger foods including fried yam/cassava, kelewele (fried plantain seasoned with delicious spices) and chicken wings seasoned with local spices.

The five-hour bus ride from Accra is a great way to see more of the country, and the VIP coaches are cheap and comfortable, showing local movies to entertain you. There is plenty to do upon arrival to Ghana's second-biggest city. Kumasi is home to the bustling Kejetia Market, which has more than 10,000 stores and stalls, and is said to be the biggest in West Africa. Visitors can buy a wide variety of items such as hand-crafted wooden sculptures and masks, paintings, native fabric, spices, handmade jewelry and much more. Kumasi is also home to the National Cultural Centre, the Menhya Palace and Lake Bosumtri. The lake is the only natural lake in Ghana and the area is peaceful and tranquil. Like Accra, Kumasi also has a vibrant nightlife with restaurants and entertainment to suit all tastes. When it comes to accomodation, Ghana offers everything from homestays to five-star accommodation. Major international chains include Golden Tulip, Novotel, Best Western and Movenpic. The Marriot, Sheraton and Hilton Hotels are set to open later in 2013.","Ghana is a country rich in history, culture and natural beauty .

"(CNN) -- Anti-American sentiment is nothing new in Iran. But what about government officials ordering that billboards expressing such views be taken down? That's what is happening in Tehran, where billboards bearing anti-U.S. slogans were collected, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Hadi Ayazi, a spokesman for Tehran municipality, told reporters that a cultural institute had installed the billboards without the consent of Tehran municipality's cultural council, IRNA reports. The move comes during a seeming thaw in U.S.-Iran relations, amid ongoing talks over the latter's nuclear program. U.S. President Barack Obama and Iranian Hassan Rouhani have even exchanged letters, with both signaling openness to further improvement. Still, like the stringent U.S.-led sanctions imposed on Iran, the animosity and tension aren't entirely gone. On the same English-language front page of IRNA, for instance, there was a story in which Ali Larijani, speaker of Iran's Parliament, criticized ""some talkative creatures"" in U.S. politics for criticizing Iran and its involvement in a possible political solution in Syria.

"(CNN) -- Bookworms eagerly awaiting the next title from their favorite author may have a new way to access those books early. Amazon is launching a program that releases select books to Kindle readers a month before they go on sale to everyone else. Called Kindle First, the program lets readers pick one of four books a month, chosen by Amazon editors from a variety of categories. This month there's a romance novel, some literary fiction, a mystery and an inspirational book based on a disco song. The books will be officially released everywhere in December. Kindle First is free to Amazon Prime members, while other people will pay $1.99 a month for their book. Amazon will announce the book selections every month via e-mail. The books will work on any Kindle device or Kindle app on a third-party device, so Android and iOS users can get them as well. For now, the program is only available in the United States. Early access to books is yet another perk added to the Amazon Prime membership program, joining streaming shows and movies, thousands of free Kindle titles, and free two-day shipping. Amazon Prime is designed to lure customers into Amazon's vast ecosystem of content and physical goods. The program is $79 a year, but it makes far more money on purchases members make, not their annual fees. If you can order a pair of shoelaces online without paying for shipping, why bother going to the store? Granting early access to content can also be a weapon against illegal downloading. Pirating ebooks may not get as much attention as movies and music, but its just as easy to do. If something is available through an official service ahead of its release date, it makes it easier for consumers to pay for the product instead of turning to more illicit channels. Some movie studios have already begun experimenting with making movies available online before they are released in theaters. Researchers at the Mercatus Center are studying data for legal and illegal downloads to see if there's a connection between making content available early and a decrease in pirating, according to Ars Technica.","Amazon program lets Kindle users download one book a month ahead of its release date .

"(CNN) -- Members of the president's party in Tunisia will quit the coalition government, the state-run news agency TAP reported Sunday. The move threatens to worsen a political crisis, set off after an opposition leader was assassinated there last week. The Congress for the Republic Party, which counts Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki among its ranks, has three ministers and two secretaries of state in the government, TAP reported. The five officials will ""continue to shoulder their responsibilities within their respective departments to avoid any administrative vacuum,"" TAP said, citing Chokri Yacoub, a party leader. The news comes one day after Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali said he would step down if a caretaker government he is forming fails to win approval from Tunisia's National Constituent Assembly. In response to the shooting death of Chokri Belaid, Jebali sacked his government and said he would appoint a new one to serve until the next election. However, a top official of Jebali's own Ennahda party labeled Jebali's moves ""non-binding,"" raising questions about his leadership. Belaid, a prominent secular politician who decried violence, was shot dead as he left his home Wednesday morning for work. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Belaid's widow and others blamed the climate fostered by Jebali's Ennahda party. Jebali denied that Ennahda had anything do with Belaid's killing and said he hoped to get approval for his new government from his party and others. ""The government, I feel, is backed by a lot of people, mainly among ordinary people. I hope that political parties will translate the view of our people,"" Jebali said Friday. As he spoke, thousands of Tunisians demonstrated in the streets of the capital in outrage over the assassination, calling on Jebali to resign. The killing of Belaid was the country's first high-profile political assassination since Tunisia's ""Jasmine Revolution"" that toppled President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali two years ago and spawned the Arab Spring. CNN's Joseph Netto contributed to this report.","The party reportedly has three ministers and two secretaries of state .

"Macon, Georgia (CNN) -- Bettye Webb-Hayes won't ever forget the day her son posed a question that stopped her in her tracks. ""Mom,"" the fourth-grader asked, ""am I white?"" It was a question she had never asked her own parents. It was something you didn't talk about in the days of the segregated South -- especially when your mom was white and your father was a mix of African-American and Native American. She went to the black schools of Macon, Georgia. Now, her son was asking probing questions. ""Why would you ask me that?"" she said. ""Because everybody at school calls me a honky,"" said the young Cordell, a light-skinned African-American. Twenty-seven years have passed since that conversation. Bettye and her son recently traveled back to Macon to face something that's been omnipresent their whole lives: the coming together of white and black. They returned for a one-of-a-kind 50th high school gathering. The classes of 1959, once segregated by race as well as gender, sat down together for the first time in history. Ruby Dean Dupree Mayes arrived two hours early for the festivities. She didn't sleep the night before. ""It's like waiting for Santa Claus to arrive. I'm so excited,"" said Mayes, who drove more than 330 miles from Tennessee to attend. Mayes went to Ballard-Hudson High, the city's black high school, whose most famous students include singers Otis Redding and Little Richard. She came this day ""to celebrate and commemorate."" ""I could not pass this event up,"" she said. ""I never dreamed of this moment -- just the realization of knowing that we had come together, at last."" As the 1959 graduates arrived, they welcomed one another. Many first greeted people of their own race. Some hadn't seen particular classmates in the 50 years since they earned their diplomas. Gradually, they began mixing and mingling. There was a commonality -- a need to come together for their children, their grandchildren and the generations to follow. Discuss the past, while moving forward in the present. Separated now by 'personal choice' It sometimes takes a son to see things in a new light. The idea for the meeting began four years ago, when a son told his father: ""Dad, think about how many friends you missed getting to know."" Those were the words of Wyatt Johnson, a public school teacher in Santa Cruz, California. He and his father, Tom Johnson, were enjoying a father-son trip to Macon in 2005 to rediscover their roots. Tom Johnson is the former head of CNN and was once the publisher of the Los Angeles Times. He's traveled the world and left his own mark along the way. Yet despite all his accomplishments, there was something he'd never done: reach out to the African-Americans of Macon from 1959, the ones he never knew because of segregation. An idea was born. He wrote to graduates of the black school, Ballard-Hudson; the white girls' school, Miller; and the white boys' school, Lanier. ""We all have deep personal memories of our high school experiences that will remain with us forever,"" he wrote. ""We had lived in a separate black and white world in Macon. ... It is a different world today. We no longer are separated, except by personal choice."" One white graduate responded with hate mail, a reminder that racism still exists. But on a day in early October, more than 200 people gathered at a Goodwill banquet hall. There was no shouting, none of the in-your-face name-calling seen in recent health care town hall meetings across the country. Here, there were tears, hugs and handshakes. Often, talk of grandkids took center stage at the 16 roundtables. They talked about race and the segregated past that prevented such closeness a half-century ago. ""You'd think we'd have grown up together,"" said Alice Bailey, a Ballard-Hudson grad. ""We still have a gift, and that's a gift of time,"" Johnson said. ""Blacks and whites together, we can do something to make the world better."" They took out notepads. They scribbled ways to take action. They began making a to-do list of 59 things for the Classes of 1959. Their goals range from building a home for Habitat to Humanity to writing letters to service men and women from Macon serving in war. They'd love to persuade the one who sent the hate mail to attend the next gathering. They also want to set an example for the elders of other Southern cities. ""I'm glad we've left the past behind,"" said Michael Cass, the 1959 class president of Lanier. The daughter of one those in attendance stood and took the microphone. ""Today, you have inspired me so much,"" she said. Many in the crowd reached for tissues. Linda Carstarphen Gugin said her whole life had been leading to this moment. ""It was the most amazing thing,"" she said. ""It was just like almost immediate bonding between people."" As the class president of Miller, she'd carried guilt for the last 50 years for not speaking out against segregation. ""I have tears about this,"" she said, crying. For Bettye Webb-Hayes and her son, the gathering underscored why the question ""Mom, am I white"" could be asked in one era and not another. Listening to his mother and her childhood friends, Cordell said, he was struck by how segregation was ""was so transparent to them at the time they were living through it. It was a way of life, so they didn't acknowledge its existence."" ""I find it interesting how human nature teaches you to accept things that are -- and some people question the reality, and other people don't."" His mother did test the reality of segregation on one occasion. Bettye and her sister went into a Woolworth's department store in Macon. They sat at a counter for food. The white waitress looked at them skeptically. She couldn't tell whether they were white or black. She grabbed a black cook for his input. ""Those are the Webb girls,"" he said. The two were kicked out. Webb-Hayes giggles about the story. She's proud she tried to break the rules. ""I think she really would've served us if she thought she could have gotten away with it."" Watch Bettye tell story of her dad and 'stupid' Elvis . It was in 1963 when Webb-Hayes realized just how wrong the segregated South was. She marched in Washington, D.C., with Martin Luther King Jr. that year. ""It was almost like you were listening to God speak in person."" Years later, Bettye -- the girl who was sent away from the Woolworth's counter -- would eat Thanksgiving dinner with President Jimmy Carter. Webb-Hayes was the music teacher for Amy Carter, the president's daughter. Her motto throughout life: ""Just do the very best you can."" She calls the gathering of the segregated schools ""unbelievable."" If it's the last trip of her life, Webb-Hayes, 68, feels her life's journey is now complete.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The attempt by the U.S. Navy to use an anti-missile missile to shoot down a potentially hazardous satellite will cost between $40 million and $60 million, Pentagon officials told CNN on Friday. A missile is launched from the Navy guided missile cruiser USS Shiloh during a 2006 test. The missile alone costs almost $10 million, Lt. Gen. Carter Ham said at a Pentagon briefing. He declined to give an overall cost estimate. ""I think we're working with all the parties to [find] how much did it cost to modify the missiles, the fire control, that kind of business,"" he said. Pentagon officials argue the effort is worth the expense because of the slim -- but real -- chance that the satellite's unused fuel, 1,000 pounds of toxic hydrazine, could land in a populated area. Because the super-secret spy satellite malfunctioned immediately after launch in December 2006, its fuel tank is full, and it would probably survive re-entry and disperse harmful, even potentially deadly fumes over an area the size of two football fields. The missile will carry no warhead; the objective is to break the satellite apart through the force of impact alone, defense officials said.  Learn more about the mission » . One Pentagon official -- who spoke on condition of anonymity because the planning for the operation remains classified -- told CNN that since early January, a Navy team, including 200 industry experts and scientists, has been working furiously to modify its sea-based Aegis missile defense system so it can shoot down a satellite in low orbit. Among the challenges is modifying sensors designed to detect the heat from an incoming warhead so they can spot the much-cooler satellite, which has no heat source and is warmed only by the sun's rays. In addition, the official says, a floating X-band radar has to be modified to track the satellite's trajectory, and the ""fire-control"" systems on the Navy ships also needed modification. No attempt will be made to shoot down the satellite until after the U.S. space shuttle lands next Wednesday. ""The window will open when the shuttle is on the ground,"" Ham said. Pentagon officials say three missiles have been modified for the mission, so in theory, the Navy may get three shots at the satellite, although only one at a time. ""They want the period of a day or two to assess the effect of the first missile ... to probably get an orbit or two, to get an understanding of what effect the first intercept had on the satellite before launching another interceptor,"" Ham said. The Aegis cruiser USS Lake Erie was chosen for the mission. It's fully equipped with sea-based missile defense systems, has long been the Navy's primary ship for the sea-based missile defense program and has the technology needed for the operation, officials said. It will be accompanied by two destroyers --- the USS Decatur and the USS Russell -- at an undisclosed location in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator. The Decatur will feed trajectory information to the Erie, and the Russell will back up the Decatur. Defense officials say the ships' radars and software were modified to track targets much faster than the ballistic missiles they were designed to track. A host of ground-based radars, telescopes and sea-based radars will help determine if the satellite was hit. The Air Force also will have a plane in the air that can detect the release of hydrazine gas. The USNS Observation Island, a ship that uses telemetry to monitor objects in space, will collect information on the satellite both before and after the missile launch. The Navy will use its $9.5 million Standard Missile 3 in the shoot-down. The combined speed of the missile and satellite at impact is expected to be about 22,000 miles per hour. The government started thinking about how to approach the satellite problem in December. And on January 4, President Bush and various senior officials agreed to begin planning for the shoot-down. On Tuesday, the president approved the plan. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Mike Mount contributed to this report .","Navy to shoot down a potentially hazardous satellite with anti-missile missile .

"(AOL Autos) -- The lines are crisp, the roofline looks sleek, and the wide stance of the wheels gives the car a performance-oriented feeling. Even though the Taurus is a full-size car, the amount of passenger room still surprised us. If you weren't standing inside the Ford booth at the Detroit Auto Show, you'd think you were looking a new luxury car -- probably an import -- not the all-new, full-size 2010 Ford Taurus. No Taurus in recent memory ever looked this good, and the transformation is welcomed because 2008-2009 Taurus isn't a great looking car. Knowing this truth, Ford decided to do something drastic. The all-new design is decidedly upscale. There's not a hint of the dowdy old style to be found. The exterior style is dominated by a sculpted hood, pronounced front fenders, and character line that runs front to back ending at the tall trailing edge of the rear fenders. Inside, a forward-leaning center control cluster clearly makes the new Taurus a five-seater. New production techniques have yielded better looking and richer feeling dash and door coverings. As evidenced in recently introduced models, Ford knows how to craft high-quality and visually pleasing interiors. Panel gaps and materials appear on par with luxury cars. AOL Autos: 2010 Ford Taurus photo gallery . Even though the Taurus is a full-size car, the amount of passenger room still surprised us. The adjective ""huge"" comes to mind. The trunk, thanks to the high profile of the rear fenders and the tall deck, is likewise enormous. Back in the days of drive-in movies, it would have been easy to fit three stow-aways back there with room for soda and chips. The 2010 Ford Taurus should have the moves to match its trimmer more athletic looks. The mechanicals are based on the Lincoln MKS, a capable performance sedan. The standard engine is a refined 3.5-liter V-6 (also used in the Lincoln), generating an estimated 263 horsepower. Along with earning ULEV-II emissions certification front-wheel-drive Taurus (all-wheel drive is optional) is expected to deliver unsurpassed highway fuel economy in the class, but Ford hasn't yet released mpg estimates. Every Taurus will be equipped with a six-speed automatic. On SEL and Limited models (the SE is the base model), the transmission will feature paddle shifters on the steering wheel, a manual shift mode, and rev-matching downshifts deliver a sportier driving experience. Compared to the outgoing model, the chassis components under the 2010 Taurus should provide sportier ride dynamics. Ford engineers promise more roll stiffness and more responsive steering. Like the MKS, the new Ford uses struts up front and multi-link, fully-independent arrangement in the rear.  AOL Autos: Detroit Auto Show overview . Ford added a healthy helping of technology to the 2010 Taurus. Many of these features were once found exclusively in high-end luxury cars, but now Ford is making them mainstream. The list of options includes: Adaptive cruise control that uses radar to adjust the car's cruising speed in traffic; keyless entry with push-button start; and Ford's SecuriCode Keyless Entry Keypad with a new keypad flush-mounted on the driver's side B-pillar. These are added to the latest version of Ford's SYNC infotainment interface that includes turn-by-turn route guidance (SYNC and GM's OnStar are in a heated battle to out-feature the other). AOL Autos: Full coverage of the Detroit Auto Show . Offering even more travel-type information is optional voice-activated NAV with SIRIUS Travel Link that uses a large eight-inch touch screen. The Travel Link subscription provides current weather conditions (real-time radar), a five-day forecast, local fuel pricing by cost per gallon as well as brand, sports scores and movie listings. One especially interesting option is what Ford is calling multi-contour front seats. These seats include six-way lumbar support and subtle rolling pattern massage. The minute but continuous movement stirs a change of muscular activation helping a driver avoid back pain and help reduce long-distance driving fatigue. We can't wait to log a few hundred miles sitting in these to see if they perform as promised. AOL Autos: Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 . On the safety front, the 2010 Taurus is well equipped with standards including six air bags (including two-row side canopy units), electronic stability control, ABS, traction control, automatic high beams, rain-sensing wipers, plus a post-crash feature that unlocks all doors, flashes the emergency flashers, and sounds the horn in an event of an airbag deployment. Safety enhancing options include a collision warning system that's part of the adaptive cruise control. When the potential for a collision is detected, the brakes are pre-charged for faster response, and a visual ""heads-up"" warning signal is flashed on the base of the windshield. AOL Autos: Cadillac CTS Sport Wagon debuts . Drivers are also warned of traffic they might not see on the highway or in parking lots by Ford's Blind Spot Information and Cross Traffic Alert systems that use rear- and side-aiming radar. Additionally, Ford's SYNC now includes a 911 Assist enhancement that will place a call to a local emergency operator in the event of an air bag deployment incident. Regardless of your take on the old Taurus, this 2010 edition looks to offer a level of technology and style never before offered for only $25,995. Expect to see it in dealers this summer. We'll bring you a full drive report as soon as test cars become available. Rex Roy is an automotive writer based in Detroit.","New full-size 2010 Ford Taurus looks more like a luxury car .

"(CNN) -- Now that it's almost over, let's remember how the whole thing started. ""Breaking Bad"" is the story of a high school chemistry teacher who found out he had lung cancer. Not that there's ever a good time for this news, but for this guy, the timing couldn't have been worse: A pregnant wife, a handicapped son and financial circumstances so dire (did I mention he was a public high school teacher?) that his wife and children will be impoverished when he dies. So he did exactly what you or I would do under the circumstances: Get into the burgeoning market for crystal methamphetamine. Among the many things you wonder: What kind of country, especially one as supposedly civilized and technologically advanced as this, would put any of its citizens in such a predicament? And there are duly elected representatives still willing to put this country's government into a coma until they force repeal of the relatively meager measures enacted into law to widen its citizens' access to health care. Granted this teacher's situation is that of an imaginary character, a sad little man who becomes enlarged by the kind of situational barbarism that can rationalize anything. But long before Obamacare became a buzzword, every American could recognize this fellow's desperate cornering as something that could happen to her or him. Ah, but imagine a more libertarian sensibility making this case. While dealing crystal meth is a very bad thing, the fact that this poor sap could use his resources as a chemist to secure enough money for treatment only proves that you don't need any government-subsidized medical care. And if the casualties of this shake-and-bake encompass dead law enforcement officers, garroted convicts, innocent passengers and crews on two commercial jets along with thousands of hapless addicts on two continents, well, these are what we call the breaks. And anyway, there are many ways for an American to exert initiative, to figure his own way out of such dilemmas that don't involve violent death and self-destruction. At least, not necessarily. Which, as everyone who's paid close attention of ""Breaking Bad"" will tell you, sounds exactly like something Walter White would say. No matter where you stand on health care -- or on anything else -- ""Breaking Bad"" has been able to make the ground beneath your feet softer and shakier than you think. Not since ""The Sopranos"" (to my mind, its one true peer in this golden age for cable television series) has there been a TV drama that watches us as intensely -- and almost as balefully -- as we watch it. Remember how we were pulled every which way on how to feel about the psychologically wounded Tony Soprano's struggle to reconcile being both a dedicated family man and ruthless criminal entrepreneur in the thick of the turn-of-the-century economic boom? So are we now torn between pity and scorn for the morally crippled Walter White's fumbling and now crumbling attempts to keep everybody close to him alive, well and happy in the midst of his sordid machinations? Is his dismal negotiation of narrowing options a hint of what the ""New Normal"" has in store for us? Maybe, maybe not. Such a question would never occur to us if we were watching a television crime show 50, 40, even 30 years ago when ""Hill Street Blues"" assumed credit for introducing black comedy and moral ambiguity to police melodrama. ""Breaking Bad"" has never overtly claimed to explain the way we live now. The finest works of art and literature never have to. They only connect. When we watch Bryan Cranston (whom I've been proclaiming our greatest living actor since roughly the second of this show's five seasons) inhabit the rotting soul of Walter White as he keeps trying to explain away everything, we are both riveted and appalled by his cluelessness, his monstrousness and his plausibility. Whether it's passively watching a junkie choking to death on her own vomit, engineering a nursing home's explosion to eliminate a threat to his survival or manipulating his partner Jesse (Aaron Paul, who will someday revive the heroic private detective genre by himself) away from suspecting him of attempted child murder, Walt is able to explain away all of it, to convince himself, if no one else (the viewers least of all), that he's doing it all to make the best out of a bad situation. Call this impulse what you want, making excuses or, better still, total denial. Denial is Walt's true addiction. More than the ""crystal blue persuasion"" Walt's been cooking or the ricin he threatens to use, denial is the toxic, satanic brew permeating ""Breaking Bad's"" narrative. Deniers are worse than explainers when they facilitate or validate gruesome activities. And yet, there have been times in the five-season run of Breaking Bad when a small part of us rooted for Walt to make the best of things somehow, even in his own twisted fashion, as though we couldn't quite believe or accept that anyone in his situation would submit to an alter ego as forbidding and deadly as Heisenberg the Meth King. From a safe distance, we judge him as we would any sociopath. But that's too easy given what a complicated mess he is. And it's the seeming normality of Walter White that makes us interrogate ourselves more than he interrogates himself. The honest, overpowering question: How much of this jerk's disease is carried in us? How much are we willing to pass by or let go just to make the best of our generally imperfect lives? I like to think I wouldn't go anywhere near Walt's dark side -- and I'm sure most of ""Breaking Bad's"" audience feels the same way. But just as Tony Soprano became our perverse surrogate in lunging for the goodies of the boom years, Walter White is the dreaded specter of the bust era, making one terrible choice after another as the legacy of dead bodies and dread excuses slowly close in on him for what promises to be a shattering revelation. No wonder we can't wait to see how it all comes out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: ""Breaking Bad's"" focus on an anti-hero challenges viewers' normal stances .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In one of the biggest busts of its kind in Hong Kong, customs authorities this week seized more than 1,100 ivory tusks, 13 rhino horns and five leopard pelts. The haul, found in a container shipped from Nigeria, is valued at more than $5.3 million. On August 6, Hong Kong customs officials -- tipped off by their mainland Chinese counterparts -- detained ""two suspicious containers"" for inspection, according to a Hong Kong government press release. Authorities found the animal products ""inside 21 sealed wooden crates at the rear of one of the containers."" Authorities have not made any arrests in this case so far. Following this week's discovery, Hong Kong customs have now confiscated some eight tons of elephant ivory -- in at least four separate hauls -- within the past year. With a black market price of almost $3,000 a kilogram, its total worth could easily surpass the $20 million mark. Customs officials in July opened a container originating from Togo to find 1,148 tusks valued at $2.2 million. On April 30, airport customs officers zeroed in on a package labelled as ""spare parts"" originating from Burundi, transiting through Hong Kong and with Singapore as its final destination. Authorities discovered 113 ivory tusks valued at nearly $400,000. In November 2012, Hong Kong authorities seized $1.4 million worth of smuggled ivory in a container from Tanzania. The 569 tusks were found buried under hundreds of bags of sunflower seeds. And in a bust just one month earlier, customs officers detained two containers from Tanzania and Kenya that claimed to be ferrying scrap plastic. More than four tons of ivory -- some 1,200 ivory tusks -- were found. The haul, valued at $3.4 million, made for one of the biggest seizures of ivory tusk in the history of the Chinese territory. Conservationists estimate that 25,000 elephants were killed for their ivory in 2011. Poaching levels have not been that high for more than 10 years. In many parts of the continent, murder rates now exceed population growth, putting elephants at risk of extinction. The reason is simple, said Jeffrey Gettleman, East Africa Bureau Chief for the New York Times to CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""It's the economic growth in Asia. And what's interesting is a lot of these economies are becoming more modern, more sophisticated, more advanced, like China, Vietnam, other parts of Asia, but they still adhere to traditional beliefs. And in many parts of Asia, ivory and rhino horn powder are valued for ceremonial purposes, for religious purposes, cultural purposes."" China is the world's number one market for ivory products, according to animal welfare groups. Hong Kong, the world's third largest port, serves as an easy entry point into and out of mainland China. As China's citizens have grown in wealth, their demand for ivory -- often referred to as ""white gold"" in the country -- has also rocketed. In fact, the fate of many of Africa's elephants lie in a small number of Chinese hands, said National Geographic's Bryan Christy to CNN's Amanpour. ""We have 35 registered carving factories in China. That's all -- 135 registered retail shops. Only 300 or 400 registered known carvers. It's a very small number of people imposing an incredible cost on Africa."" Since 2009, the number of large-scale seizures of ivory headed for Asia -- categorized as more than 800 kilograms per shipment -- has more than doubled according to a March 2013 report by CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. The number of incidents hit a record in 2011. Under Hong Kong law, a person found guilty of trading endangered species for commercial purposes is liable to a maximum fine of $5 million and imprisonment for two years.","Hong Kong customs seized more than 1100 ivory tusks, 13 rhino horns, five leopard pelts .

"(CNN) -- From a distance, it is its shiny exterior that first catches the eye. As you step closer, a rooftop solar panel, an outdoor security light and a roof overhang make Nosango Plaatjie's shack stand out amid the sprawling cluster of makeshift wooden structures and rusty corrugated iron dwellings where her neighbors live. Welcome to the iShack, or improved shack, an innovative approach to housing that's being tested in the windswept slum of Enkanini, just outside Stellenbosch, South Africa. The dwelling, developed by researchers at the University of Stellenbosch, is intended to raise the living standards of slum residents while improving their access to electricity and protecting them from extreme temperatures in an environmentally friendly way. Read: 'Solar sisters' spreading light in Africa . The iShack prototype is occupied by Plaatje and her three young children. It is fully equipped with a photovoltaic panel capable of producing enough electricity to power three lights, a mobile phone charger and an outdoor motion detector spotlight. Its windows are strategically placed to achieve better air circulation and sunlight heating, while the roof is sloped so that rainwater can be harvested during the winter months. Recycled cardboard boxes and old Tetra Pak containers are used for insulation between the exterior zinc surface and the interior, while a flame-retardant paint is used to lessen the risk of fires. Inside the shack, rows of recycled bricks create a sturdy flooring base and act as ""thermal mass,"" protecting against temperature change. Plaatjie, a domestic worker employed once a week, says her family's life has improved a great deal after relocating to the ecologically designed iShack. Their previous home was a cold, damp shack hastily put together from disused pallets and corroded zinc sheets. A leaking roof, bare earth floor and lack of windows made conditions even tougher, while the shortage of electricity meant that Plaatje would often miss out on important calls about work as she couldn't always walk long distances to charge her phone. ""Now I am available all the time and it is helping me to make more money,"" Plaatjie told iShack's developers. She added: ""The solar [lights] are better. Now we don't need to go to sleep early anymore because now we have lights. My daughter must do her homework now, she doesn't have any more excuses. And I like the light outside because we can see what is going on, I feel safer."" Read: Harnessing pedal power to light up Africa . According to U.N. Habitat, 62% of the urban population in Sub-Saharan Africa lives in slums, which it describes as being typically characterized by deplorable living conditions, a feeling of insecurity and inadequate infrastructure for basic energy, sanitation and water services. In South Africa, thousands of informal settlements have sprouted up in recent decades on the urban perimeter. To deal with the pressing housing problem, the government has shifted its emphasis from building new brick and mortar houses toward in-situ upgrading of existing informal settlements and providing access to services. But the iShack's developers say that slum dwellers usually have to wait for years for power and water grids or low-cost housing to arrive. They say that a growing housing backlog, coupled with budgetary constraints and a surge in urbanization rates, means that poorly serviced dwellings are likely to be part of urban living in South Africa for years to come. ""Shacks are becoming the new norm,"" explains Andreas Keller, one of the developers of iShack. ""So what can we do today in order to improve the living conditions of people through energy intervention, lighting, cell phones, communication, upping security? ""That's where the planning comes in and the technology takes it one step further."" The developers say the project is a cost-effective solution that shows what communities can achieve in the short term. Excluding the solar power system, the iShack costs about 5,600 rand ($660). The typical cost of a shack in Enkanini can vary from a few rand, when somebody collects materials at the landfill and carries them back to the settlement, all the way up to 5,000 rand ($582) on the informal real estate market, says Keller. ""The rationale is that over time the additional cost upfront will be recouped through reduced fuel bill [and] greater wellbeing,"" he adds. Read: Cape Town takes on Tinseltown . Now, thanks to a grant by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the iShack project will be trialled over the next year. Up to 100 shacks will either be built or retrofitted to determine whether the system can be applied on a larger scale. Keller says that as the project grows, community members trained in maintaining and repairing the solar power systems will be able to sell affordable energy to other residents. This will help them earn a living and also pay for new batteries for the iShacks. ""We need to encourage the informal settlers, the slum dwellers, to invest into this infrastructure themselves,"" says Keller. ""We cannot rely on a passive population to simply sit there and expect governments to solve their problems, so we need to make sure that any investments that they've made won't become redundant in the future.""","The iShack aims to improve living conditions for people in slums .

"Valdosta, Georgia (CNN) -- Michael Moore, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, is expected to make an announcement Thursday in the case of Kendrick Johnson. The Georgia teen was found dead inside a rolled-up high school gym mat this year. It's unclear what exactly Moore will say. He has previously said he was reviewing the case and weighing whether to open an investigation. A news conference is scheduled for 1 p.m. ET Thursday. Surveillance images and other materials that could shed light on the January death must be released to the boy's parents, a Lowndes County judge ruled Wednesday. ""We are happy to hear we are one step closer to the truth,"" Kendrick Johnson's father, Kenneth Johnson, said after the hearing. A state medical examiner ruled Kendrick, a high school athlete, suffocated after getting stuck in the gym mat. His parents -- who believe he was murdered -- disputed the findings and won a court order to have their son's body exhumed for another autopsy. CNN has obtained surveillance video, which was part of what the judge ordered released, showing Kendrick walking along a school hallway and into the gym where he was later found dead. Another student is seen walking in ahead of him. The video also shows Kendrick inside the gym, walking out of the shot, and other students playing basketball. The materials released by the judge -- photographs from inside the gym at Lowndes County High School, surveillance video from outside and investigative documents -- are unlikely to prove what happened to the boy, Johnson family attorney Chevene King said. None of the imagery is believed to show what led to Kendrick's death, King said. Gym mat death shocker: Body stuffed with newspaper . But the materials could cast doubt on the official explanation and nudge officials toward reclassifying Kendrick's death to allow a new investigation into what happened, King said. ""Essentially, it shifts the focus from what the sheriff had offered to other theories that were not explored and that have I think begun to slowly creep to the surface,"" King said after the hearing. The school district and sheriff's office had refused to release some of the materials, citing state law that exempts the release of ""education records of a minor child."" CNN filed a motion last week to join the family's lawsuit seeking investigative files related to the case, including the surveillance records. The motion was granted.

"(CNN) -- A California man indicted in a Vanderbilt University football rape investigation traveled to Tennessee and surrendered to police, Nashville authorities said Friday. Miles Joseph Finley, 19, who is charged with evidence tampering, will be arraigned later. His bail was set at $10,000, Nashville police said, and it was unclear Friday whether Finley had posted that bail. Neither he nor his attorney could be immediately reached for comment. A co-defendant, Joseph Dominick Quinzio, 20, of Palm Desert, California, ""continues to go through the legalities of the extradition process in California,"" police said in a statement. Finley, of Bermuda Dunes, California, and Quinzio are friends of Brandon Vandenburg, one of four former Vanderbilt football players indicted on charges of rape, and are each accused of one felony count of tampering with electronic evidence, authorities said. Vandenburg is accused of taking an unconscious Vanderbilt woman into a building on campus on June 23. He was allegedly joined in his dorm room by three now-former Vanderbilt football players also indicted on charges of rape: Cory Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian McKenzie, authorities said. A fifth football player, Chris Boyd, 21, a standout junior wide receiver, pleaded guilty to helping cover up the alleged on-campus gang rape and was removed from the team. He accepted a yearlong probation sentence and agreed to testify against the four other players. The four other football players have been dismissed from the team and suspended from school. Each of the four men has been charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg was also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography, police said.","Miles Joseph Finley, 19, is accused of evidence tampering .

"(CNN) -- Russia and France are preparing contingency plans to evacuate their citizens from Egypt, as violent clashes between the military government and Islamists in the country continue. In the latest violence, suspected militants killed at least 25 Egyptian soldiers with rocket-propelled grenades in the Sinai Peninsula. Russia's Federal Aviation Agency has ordered airlines to prepare plans to airlift Russian tourists from Egypt, the Moscow Times reported. Russia's largest airline, Aeroflot, said it was ready to begin evacuating passengers from the country as soon as it was instructed to do so. Late last week France also announced that it had a plan to evacuate its citizens under review. Travel advice hardens . Russia was among other governments that had already hardened their travel advice on Egypt following the killing last week of more than 500 people in Cairo and other cities in protests against the military overthrow of the government of Mohamed Morsi. Having advised its citizens against traveling to Egypt, on Thursday Russia barred tour operators from selling vacations to the country. Germany extended its advice against travel to the country to include the Red Sea beach resorts around Hurghada and Sharm El-Sheikh -- areas that have been largely immune from the unrest of recent months and that foreign governments have tended to advise were safe. Last week the government of Hong Kong also raised its travel warning, to ""black,"" advising against all travel. On Wednesday night, following the day of violence in Egypt in which hundreds of people died as security forces cleared pro-Morsi sit-ins, vacationers in Hurghada had letters posted through their hotel bedroom doors telling them to stay within the hotel grounds and that all excursions had been canceled, the TravelMole website reported. U.S. and British travel advisories on Egypt remain basically unchanged. The U.S. State Department continues to urge its citizens to leave Egypt, if they can. Any remaining in the country should monitor local media for updates on the unrest, it says. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to advise against travel to Egypt, except the Red Sea resorts. The FCO has for some time advised against travel to the lawless Sinai Peninsula, where the recent grenade attack on Egyptian soldiers took place, except for the resort areas. Compensation . Government travel advisories are important not only for travelers' safety but because they affect what compensation they can claim. Following the German government's announcement, the tour operator TUI Germany said it was cancelling all trips to Egypt until September 15 and that travelers already in its resorts could stay for the remainder of their holiday or leave early. In Britain, a travel journalist specializing in the Middle East, Matthew Teller, told the Guardian: ""What the FCO does or doesn't say rules the roost in terms of what tour operators can and can't offer clients."" Travelers were unlikely to be able to change their plans if they were booked to travel in an area, such as Sharm el-Sheikh and other Red Sea resorts, that the government deemed safe, he said. Cancellations . Other large travel firms were altering or canceling their Egypt travel programs, in addition to TUI. Thomas Cook said it had canceled all excursions from Red Sea resorts to Cairo, Luxor and sights including Moses Mountain and St Catherine's Monastery on the Sinai Peninsula. Kuoni, the UK-based operator, has also canceled all Egyptian excursions for 30 days. British Airways has changed its flight schedules to Cairo to avoid the dusk-to-dawn curfew the government has imposed as part of its state of emergency, although tour operators are still being allowed to operate overnight transfers to Sharm el-Sheikh. ""We are also offering customers the option of rebooking to a later date, or to another destination,"" a BA spokesman said. Most tourists fly to the Red Sea resorts directly. Easyjet, which runs flights to Sharm el-Sheikh, said it was allowing some passengers with flights booked to Egypt within the next few days to change their destination. The cruise operators MSC, Costa and Holland America Line have also reportedly canceled their Egypt-bound ships. Tourism vital . The latest violence in months of unrest in Egypt can only do further damage to the country's vital tourism industry, which normally employs around 10% of the workforce and brought in $10 billion in 2012. As chaos has increasingly gripped the country, beginning with anti-government protests in 2011 that led to the overthrow of the Hosni Mubarak regime, tourist numbers have fallen by almost one-third -- from 14 million in 2010 to 10.5 million last year. In further news, the Egyptian ministry for antiquities has closed archaeological sites and museums across the country to protect them from looting, the Egyptian newspaper al Alhram reported.","France, Russia prepare plans to fly citizens out .

"(CNN) -- When making a big decision, how aware are you of the underlying brain processes informing your choices? When you go with your gut instinct, are you aware of the bodily signals that have informed your actions? While it may seem that there is no time for the close inspection of the body and mind at these critical times, enlightened leaders are turning towards mindfulness training as a way to reprogram their mind in a bid to stay sane and pull ahead in today's challenging business environment. Not only does this allow individuals to clearly see the intentions and reactions underlying each and every action-- learning when an action is arising out of fear of uncertainty or rejection and becoming better able to detect a ""sure thing"" via bodily signals. By repeatedly training the mind to pay attention to the sensations of the body as they enter the brain, mindfulness training uses this information to build up an exquisitely sensitive understanding of our reactions and responses in the world -- both at work and elsewhere in our lives. The term mindfulness refers to a particular state of mind, one that is alert, aware and fully present to what is unfolding on a moment by moment basis in the mental and physical landscape. Importantly, this awareness includes an element of acceptance, not judging whatever you discover in the process. The route to mindfulness is through attention training. In our general understanding, attention is something we direct outwards into the environment -- something pleasant catches our attention and we turn to look, something annoying distracts us and our mind wanders. This process changes the neural connectivity between regions of the brain related to attention and concentration. Sounds great, but what's the catch? The catch is that you need to train to get these benefits. Similar to visiting the gym and repeatedly lifting weights to develop muscles, to improve focus, concentration, and build emotional resilience you need to train your brain. An in-depth understanding of mindfulness from reading about it does not count as it is not training the neural networks. Bringing your attention in a sustained way to the breath and the body is the starting point of these practices. To obtain the best results, this training in done in a quiet dedicated environment. For example, 20 minutes of mindfulness practice in the morning will radically change how you experience your working day and relate to others. In the early stages of training, similar to when we first go to the gym, there is frustration and annoyance with our inability to stay focused and the effort required. This is because we are training these neural networks for the first time and the wetware of the brain is floppy and the mind undisciplined. The mind gets easily bored and distracted and thinks of a million other things it should be doing. We might also be alarmed when we see the quantity of mental activity that we weren't aware of at all! With practice however, the ability to stay focused becomes easier, productivity increases, there is less distraction from emails and phone calls and memory improves. One study has shown that mindfulness training helps reduce the age-related decline in the number of neurons in the hippocampus -- a region of the brain vital for memory. Perhaps most importantly, we can learn to be really present and attentive with those who really matter -- our loved ones. Where is your mind when your phone beeps and vibrates during a family dinner? High pressure situations, those involving emotions such as fear and anxiety, are when reactive mental habits are most likely to be triggered. Mindfulness allows us to see more clearly how draining this is in terms of our brain's energy reserves and how this clogs up our ability to problem solve in a creative way. Fear creates constriction in the mind, meaning we tend to stick with what we know and lose the ability to think flexibly. This happens at the level of the individual and in a wider sense in organizations. Precisely at the time when we need to be creative, the conditions of uncertainty about our economic future leads to behaviors that are constricted and conservative and more likely to keep us stuck. Engaging with the bodily sensations related to these negative emotions is at the heart of mindfulness. Improvements in attention are a happy side effect of mindfulness but the real changes occur when we are able to embrace fear in an accepting way. Those who are willing to fail, and can sit with the uncertainty of not knowing will be those who ultimately succeed because their mental resources have been freed up in a way that allows creativity and flexible thinking to emerge. Mindfulness training is found in sectors as diverse as health, sport, military, education, and in the boardroom. Tomorrow's leaders know that it will take more than technical expertise and access to facts and figures to remain competitive. Hence giants such as Google and General Mills now include mindfulness training within their organizations. The ability to communicate, to really listen, to be flexible in responding, and to be creative and courageous in decision making are the so-called ""soft"" skills that leaders are realizing are essential for the health and growth of their talent and business. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr Tamara Russell.","Business leaders are taking up mindfulness training to make better decisions, says Dr Tamara Russell .
Studies show the training can help reduce the age-related decline in the brain .

"(CNN) -- When talking to Sandra Bullock, it won't be long before she mentions that special guy in her life: her 3-year-old son, Louis. The 49-year-old single parent has been frank about putting her role as a mom ahead of her role as America's Sweetheart, recently telling Vogue magazine that she wouldn't hesitate to ""move to Alaska"" should her career begin to negatively impact Louis. But for now, Bullock is still ensconced in Hollywood. The actress has been selective with taking new work after her Oscar-winning turn in 2009's ""The Blind Side,"" but her decision to star in Alfonso Cuarón's October space thriller ""Gravity"" just might lead Bullock into another busy awards season. Sandra Bullock squashes George Clooney romance rumors . In the film, she plays a medical engineer by the name of Dr. Ryan Stone, who, accompanied by George Clooney's skilled astronaut Matt Kowalsky, embarks on her first shuttle mission. As you've probably seen in the heart-stopping trailers, all goes well until the shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky stranded in space. Bullock was challenged with simulating the concept in a believable way and consulted an astronaut to make sure she nailed the role physically as well as emotionally. Yet even with that preparation, shooting ""Gravity"" was still ""hard on a daily level, for many reasons,"" Bullock told CNN. Toronto: 'Gravity' wows, propelling Bullock toward an Oscar nomination . ""The nice thing was that no matter what was going on, I got to go home to the same little guy, or have him there,"" she continued, speaking of her son. ""They made it so that he could be there with me 24/7. They created 'Louis-land' on a sound stage in damp, cold weather; they created Disneyland. So I knew that he was OK, (and) he was happy. And so it was worth going in and struggling for those 12 hours, because there was someone not struggling, right over there."" Working with Cuarón did fuel Bullock's natural fascination with what else is out there in the universe, but as far as turning her on to the idea of space travel, that's still a no-go. ""Actually going into space ... that's not me. I'm very happy right here,"" she said, relenting that perhaps a payment -- in the neighborhood of $1 billion, let's say -- could convince her to change her mind. Sandra Bullock hails law limiting paparazzi: 'Children should not be sold' ""If I was 80 years old and they said 'here's a billion dollars to go,' I would do it, or if I was 80 and my son was a thrill-seeker or an astronaut and asked me to go with him, then I'd do it,"" Bullock said. ""And I'm assuming that I'd perish. That's why I'm picking that 80. I'm grown; he's good; any resentments that we need to work out, then let's go to space."" At this age, though, Louis is completely unaware that his mom is famous and probably wealthy enough to pull that off. ""He has no idea (that I'm famous),"" Bullock said. ""I'm simply the mom who makes the lunch, drives to school, finds where the toys are, washes the clothes, and I'm here to play. And that's all I should be. He should have no idea what I do. It should have no importance. ... He's supposed to be a little person for as long as possible. And I hope I don't impede that with by what I do."" CNN's Marc Istook and Topher Gauk-Roger contributed to this report.","Sandra Bullock loves to talk about her son, Louis .

"(CNN) -- A Cleveland man was indicted Thursday in the killings of two women, cases that were resurrected after the discovery of three women held captive for years by Ariel Castro. Elias Acevedo Sr., 49, was charged with 293 counts, including aggravated murder, rape and kidnapping, said Timothy McGinty, the Cuyahoga County prosecutor. Acevedo is accused of strangling 30-year-old Pamela Pemberton on October, 24, 1994, and leaving her body in a vacant lot, according to the indictment and authorities. Last week, the FBI's Violent Crime Task Force linked Acevedo to the murder of Christina Adkins, who disappeared in 1995 at age 18, McGinty said. Remains believed to be those of Adkins were found this month in a utility vault near the intersection of interstates 71, 90 and 490, the prosecutor said. As a result of the finding, the grand jury indicted Acevedo on murder charges in that case, too. Acevedo was indicted earlier this year in a 1993 rape, which occurred near where Pemberton's body was found the next year, McGinty said. Bret Jordan, Acevedo's attorney in the 1993 case, declined to comment on the latest indictments. Acevedo is expected to be arraigned on the new charges next week. Jordan said he will find out at the arraignment whether he has been assigned the new case. Acevedo was arrested earlier this year in the same Cleveland neighborhood where authorities found Amanda Berry, Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus and Michelle Knight in May at Castro's two-story home. Castro, who pleaded guilty to 937 counts, was found hanged with a bedsheet in his jail cell on September 3. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Elias Acevedo, 49, has been charged with 293 counts, including rape and murder .

"(TIME.com) -- Not familiar with the ""Quantified Self?"" It's latest trend in obsessively tracking every possible health measure, in real time, that emerged as a major theme at South By Southwest (SXSW) Interactive Festival this year. With more body-tracking gadgets that can record everything from running blood pressure to respiration to perspiration rates and more, the next question is -- so what? What are we supposed to make of the massive amounts of data that these constantly tracking devices amass? We're not talking about the familiar pedometer that clunkily clicked away the number of steps you took a day. There are a new generation of medical monitoring devices originally meant to evaluate patients in the hospital that have been made over into sexier, wearable versions for the health conscious or merely health-curious. The result? Sophisticated and personalized health monitoring that may be generating a lot of information that we are still learning to interpret. TIME.com: The quantified self evolves: A South by Southwest vision of how gadgets will teach us about ourselve . Take BodyMedia, a wearable body monitoring-systems company that spent its first 10 years developing products for the medical research sector before switching gears to consumer devices in 2009, targeting individuals who need to lose weight. Their public-friendly product is a clinically-validated armband that gathers physiological information from three small, sensors underneath the armband. The sensors start collecting a flood of 5,000 data points per minute, including measurements of heat flux (the rate at which heat is dissipating from the body), motion, skin temperature and the skin's electrical conductivity, which are then converted into more meaningful measurements such as the number of calories burned, sleep quality and how efficient the body is overall in performing its metabolic duties. ""That manifests itself into accuracy, personalization and more of a health orientation. We are more than an activity tracker or fitness device, we are actually a health management tool,"" says Christine Robins, CEO of BodyMedia, who held a ""Wearing Your Health on Your Sleeve (Literally)"" session on Sunday. BodyMedia users upload their data online where additional software analyzes the information and relays it in more digestible form. Users pre-set their body parameters and goals, and the software shows them when they fall behind in the areas like calorie burn, physical activity and sleep efficiency. TIME.com: Viewpoint: Cory Booker wins South by Southwest -- How a mayor conquered America's biggest tech festival . SXSW has a track record in the area; last year, the Nike FuelBand -- a daily activity tracker -- debuted at the festival, launching a trend toward capturing big health data that is still struggling to find meaning. Studies show that communities of people who coalesce around a health goal may benefit from the support they receive from each other, but it's not clear yet that having access to detailed information about the fluctuations in health measures can translate into measurable, healthier outcomes. The thought, or hope, among developers is that if the software and hardware of these gadgets and apps are appealing and easy to use, more people will adopt them and that the added information will be motivating, rather than intimidating, and prompt them to make meaningful changes to improve their health. The devices are still new, and significant and widespread behavior changes are not apparent yet. There's no guarantee that all of that information will even be welcome, or remain inspiring after the initial thrill wears off. Studies of people on diets that required them to track and calculate calories, for example, showed that dieters tended to feel overwhelmed by the task and quickly lost interest in shedding pounds. ""The challenge is establishing what people should do with (this large volume of new health data),"" says Sarah Rotman Epps, a senior analyst at Forrester Research who led a session on ""Wearables: Moving From Niche To Mainstream."" ""A lot of consumers don't think health is their responsibility and that it's in the realm of their doctor. For some companies, to sell a device and track health is not resonating with people."" BodyMedia, for example, plans to turn their years of medical research knowledge into a series of monitoring devices for chronic diseases ranging from sleep disorders to diabetes management. But appealing to consumers outside of those who normally track their metabolic measures -- like athletes and dieters -- could be a challenge. So far, the benefits of these devices come in the form of the support they get from joining online communities. Most of the devices connect to smartphones and allow users to download or share the data collected -- seeding social networks of like-minded data-curious individuals who want to broadcast and analyze their latest blood pressure or skin conductivity numbers. That makes the devices an ideal fit for SXSW Interactive, says Hugh Forrest, the festival's director. ""A lot of these business models center around the idea of building a fitness community or a healthy eating community. Community is certainly one of the bedrocks here at SXSW,"" says Forrest. ""At our best moments we really celebrate and foster a sense of community, so a lot of these fitness-related apps and services really leverage that."" higi, a social networking tool that uses cloud-based technology to aggregate measurements of users' body and lifestyle choices spawned a community centered around the ""higi Score,"" an aggregated measure that represents their overall health status. Personal interactions, like your relationship status, how many friends you have on Facebook and community engagements and how often you send encouraging words to fellow users, all count toward the score. Users can update their health stats via their smartphone, or at higi stations -- which are now located in thousands of retail pharmacies -- with their weight, BMI, pulse and height. Users can even upload photos of their meals for a calorie calculation. And to make it more interesting, members can compete in the higiSphere for high scores -- topping off at 999 -- or work together to improve their scores, since the amount of interaction you have with people impacts your personal number. ""People who collect their data, share their data,"" says Michael Ferro, higi creator and founder. ""It allows one to see improvements all the time and change habits. The (user's) ranking in the world and in the community is changing by the second. You are the stock on the market, and it can go up and down depending on what's going on in your community. We want to make it so it is not work, but a game."" TIME.com: Listen now -- 9 new bands worth celebrating at South by Southwest . While it's not clear yet that having access to detailed information about the fluctuations in health measures can translate into measurable, healthier outcomes, there is no denying that the health, fitness and tech spheres continue to provide more ways to educate people about their bodies. Forrest says health and fitness has become a popular theme of the festival, which now includes organized daily runs for attendees and more sessions focused on health-related technology and apps. And the products are by no means reserved for tech-buffs and social media over-sharers. As always, our ability to interpret and make use of all that health information lags behind the innovations made in collecting it. But if information is indeed power, that may soon change.

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- One minute, he's checking a cat's mouth for gingivitis. The next, he's carefully bandaging a dog's bloody, broken nail. This could be any hard-working veterinarian tending to ailing animals. But the embroidered name on his crisp white medical coat bears a familiar name: Dr. John Ensign. He's better known as former Nevada Sen. John Ensign, who abruptly announced his resignation 10 months ago amid a high-profile sex scandal. ""I built this,"" Ensign told CNN in an exclusive interview inside West Flamingo Animal Hospital, where he now works. ""It was the first 24-hour animal hospital in Las Vegas, and Dr. Yak [the current owner] bought this from me, and now I'm working for him,"" he mused, calling it humbling, yet also ""a very healthy thing to have happen in life."" Ensign was the only veterinarian in Congress. He hadn't practiced since becoming a U.S. senator more than a decade ago. Ensign took CNN on an exclusive tour of the animal hospital, just a few blocks west of the Bellagio hotel and famous Las Vegas Strip. Stopping to look at a large dog getting a digital X-ray, he points to the image. ""You can tell he's had a crushed pelvis there,"" he said. ""You see our X-ray equipment? It's all digital now."" He said he works hard to get up to speed on the changes in technology and techniques since he was elected to the Senate. ""Literally, I'm studying, you know, till 10, 11 o'clock every night and just trying to make sure that I get back up to a very high level in veterinary medicine,"" Ensign said. ""There's been a steep learning curve, and I've gone to continuing-ed [education] conferences. I've spent time with specialty practices, both in California and here,"" he said. He insists veterinary medicine is where his heart is. ""I loved being in the Senate. That was a wonderful experience. But I'm putting as much passion into this as I did that, and so I'm really enjoying it. And the other nice thing is being home every night, you know, seeing my wife and kids every day,"" Ensign said. Ensign is still with his wife, Darlene, and says they're doing ""great"" -- healing after his extramarital affair with Cynthia Hampton, a longtime friend and employee, led to his political downfall. Last spring, the Senate Ethics Committee issued a lengthy, stinging report with a torrid narrative of the affair, accusing Ensign of violating the law by trying to help Hampton's aggrieved husband -- a former staffer -- find lobbying jobs. Ensign, an evangelical Christian, resigned three weeks before the report came out. When asked if he left Congress to avoid testifying before the Senate Ethics Committee, he said, ""My family had been through enough. I didn't want to put them through more."" Ensign and his wife have three children, two boys and a girl -- one in college, one in high school and one in junior high. The committee report recommended that the Justice Department investigate Ensign for violating the law, but he told us he has no indication that is happening. ""I haven't heard anything since I left. I really don't think about it until somebody like you asks me about it,"" he said. But he did offer that he didn't think the ethics report was fair, saying it published the report without incorporating what Ensign submitted. ""They did not even consider our side in it,"" Ensign said. He is introspective about his fall from grace, warning those still in politics not to let power get the best of them, as it did him. ""Do everything that you possibly can to keep yourself grounded. And a big part of that is keep people surrounded, keep people around who basically will slap you upside the head and tell you when you're doing wrong,"" he advised. Didn't he have that? ""I thought I did, but after a while, you develop invisible barriers and to where they're actually intimidated to do that, even though I would say it all the time,"" he said. ""Even when you really value people, you can still develop a little bit of an arrogance that you don't even see in yourself."" Ensign's political star was once so bright, the former member of the Republican leadership in the Senate had pondered a presidential run. Does he have pangs now, watching GOP contenders like Mitt Romney and his old friend Rick Santorum go at it? Ensign shakes his head. ""The chances for me would have been so slim anyway, but you know you can't go back, you can't look back. I'm looking forward to veterinarian medicine, I'm having a ball."" When he's not at West Flamingo Animal Hospital, Ensign spends his time at an animal shelter neutering dogs and cats -- and the shelter sometimes does hundreds in one day. He recently had to put a dog to sleep for the first time since returning to veterinarian medicine. ""It was an older dog, and you know I held the lady, I hugged her. She wanted to be there when the animal was put to sleep. It was her husband's dog, and he died four years ago, and so at the same time, you look at that as an incredible responsibility to be there for people,"" Ensign said. It's those moments that make Ensign call veterinarian medicine his life's passion. And what about the politics? The profession he was forced to leave? Ensign tries to keep a sense of humor about it all. ""You know the bark is worse than the bite in D.C.,"" he said, tongue firmly in his cheek, adding, ""I was vaccinated for rabies."" CNN Senior Congressional Producer Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","EXCLUSIVE: John Ensign is now working at a veterinarian hospital he once owned .

On a Sunday afternoon each fall for the last eight years, Bentley has been at the head of the line as motorcycle enthusiasts follow him on an hour-long ride from the Harley dealership in Columbia, Tennessee, to downtown Nashville's Riverfront Park. The day ends with a star-studded concert, with some of the biggest names in country music joining Bentley on his mission. Over the last eight years Bentley, his famous friends and their fans have raised over $2 million for the Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt. ""The idea for this started, I guess, not long after I went out on the road. We were just trying to figure out a way to give back to the Nashville community, do something here. (We) get so many offers to do different types of events to give back, we kind of wanted to make our own so we could really focus on one particular thing,"" Bentley said. ""We wanted to do something here in Nashville, so we chose the Vanderbilt children's hospital and Children's Miracle Network and kind of focused our efforts towards that. It's been great. From the very beginning we've made money, and I've been able to bring a big check over to the hospital every year. I felt really good about that."" Bentley also credits the advice of a music icon in helping him focus his charitable efforts. ""I sat next to Bono one time and heard about all his exploits and all the stuff he does with his organization ONE,"" he said. Bentley said he was overwhelmed at how much Bono's anti-poverty group was accomplishing, ""but something he said, and I tell other people too, is to just concentrate on what's right in front of you. It could be a smallest thing in the world, just taking, helping out one person. You're making a difference in changing somebody's life, so just taking something you can tackle and get behind."" While his primary focus was to give back in his own backyard, Bentley took his show on the road and held rides in several other cities including Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, and Phoenix to benefit the children's hospitals in those towns. ""I really like the idea of that because so many towns and cities across this country have given me so much, have given me a life, it's nice to be able to go in and give back,"" Bentley said. Bentley brought the event back to Nashville a few years ago and said it's been pretty easy to get his famous pals to contribute their time on a Sunday afternoon they'd typically have off. Big stars like Luke Bryan, Jake Owen and Brett Eldredge bring the fans in, and as a result the fund-raising is more and more profitable every year. If you ask him about all the star-powered help he gets, Bentley just chalks it up to people helping each other out. But that's not entirely it, according to the event's emcee Storme Warren, host of Great American Country's ""Headline Country."" ""I think it's as simple as his energy and his genuineness. There's just something about Dierks that you want to root for, and the whole town feels that. He's loved by everybody, both as an artist and as a person. So it's like he gets behind a cause, you want to help him out with it. And it's his ability to step out on the edge and say, 'All right, nobody else is doing this? Let's do it. Let's get it done!' and we all fall in line,"" Warren said. This year Bentley led 2,000 riders down the back roads of middle Tennessee, including a few famous faces. Even the fictitious mayor of Music City -- at least, he plays the mayor on ABC's ""Nashville"" -- Eric Close was along for the ride. ""I'm here to support the ride that's supporting Children's Hospital,"" Close said. ""One of the things I love about the city of Nashville -- it's an incredibly charitable place. There's constantly events going on, people are very supportive. It's constant that people are out there trying to make a difference, and this is one of those events where they're making a difference in the lives of kids through the children's hospital at Vanderbilt,"" said Close. Bentley, who didn't have children when he started this fund-raiser, now is the father of three and is even more aware of the importance of his cause. ""You're always just praying to have a healthy kid, that's the most important thing, and knock on wood, we have. But you never know when you could be in someone else's shoes and need the assistance of the great medical staff and team, like at Vanderbilt children's hospital. So (the ride is) something I definitely look forward to every year and definitely feel really honored to just to kind of be the face of the whole deal,"" Bentley said. Miles and Music for Kids this year raised over $300 thousand -- a new record.","Dierks Bentley hosts an annual fund-raiser for Vanderbilt children's hospital .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's parliament set out new guidelines for its relations with the United States, as it agreed to re-engage with Washington after months of tension over deadly airstrikes on a Pakistani border post by NATO forces and other issues. A list of recommendations approved by lawmakers includes a call for an immediate end to U.S. drone attacks and no further use of Pakistan as a transportation route for weapons into Afghanistan. Future relations with the United States are to be based on mutual interest, Parliament Speaker Raza Rabbani said, as he read out the list to lawmakers. In addition, no overt or covert operations will be allowed on Pakistani soil and no private security companies or operatives will be permitted in Pakistan, he said. Foreign countries will not be allowed to establish bases in Pakistan, Rabbani said. The recommendations were drawn up by the Parliamentary Committee on National Security, a group of 18 lawmakers responsible for reviewing relations with the United States, NATO and ISAF. Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani told lawmakers that his government would work to implement the resolution ""in letter and spirit."" But in Washington, the U.S. State Department greeted the demands coolly. ""We respect the seriousness with which parliament's review of U.S.-Pakistan relations has been conducted,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a statement issued Thursday afternoon. ""We seek a relationship with Pakistan that is enduring, strategic, and more clearly defined. We look forward to discussing these policy recommendations with the government of Pakistan and continuing to engage with it on our shared interests."" Relations between Pakistan and the United States hit a new low after NATO airstrikes on November 26 killed 24 Pakistani soldiers on the Pakistani-Afghan border. The deaths added to the anger already felt by Pakistanis over the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden at a compound in Pakistan last May, and continued American drone strikes on targets in the nation. Following the deadly border airstrikes, the Pakistani government shut down the two NATO supply routes in the country, asked the United States to vacate an air base on its territory and boycotted a conference about the future of Afghanistan. U.S. President Barack Obama expressed hope last month that the two nations could arrive at a ""balanced approach"" to relations as he met with Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani on the sidelines of a nuclear security summit in South Korea. The talks were the highest profile meeting between the two countries since the November airstrikes. Obama said then that his expectation was that ""we can achieve the kind of balanced approach that respects Pakistan's sovereignty but also respects our concerns with respect to our national security and our needs to battle terrorists who have targeted us in the past."" Gilani expressed appreciation that Obama had acknowledged the need to respect Pakistani sovereignty and said his government was committed to fighting against extremism. He also said it was important to maintain stability in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. An investigation into the lethal NATO airstrikes in November by Brig. Gen. Stephen Clark on behalf of the United States concluded that Pakistan provoked NATO forces and that distrust between the two parties led to the firefight. Pakistan disputed the findings, saying Clark's report was factually incorrect. There has been a sharp drop in the number of drone attacks in Pakistan since the airstrikes. U.S. officials rarely discuss the CIA's drone program in Pakistan, though privately they have said that the covert strikes are legal and an effective tactic in the fight against extremists. CNN's Nasir Habib, Aliza Kassim and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Pakistan's prime minister promises to follow the guidelines ""in letter and spirit""

"(CNN) -- Floating wind farms could soon be powering thousands of European homes after a prototype seaborne turbine sailed through technological trials off the coast of Agucadoura, Portugal. The 54-meter tall renewable structure sits atop a semi-submersible platform known as a WindFloat situated five kilometers from shore. It has been manufactured by WindPlus, a consortium of energy and clean-tech companies including Principle Power, Energias de Portugal and Vestas. The group hopes their primary success will help secure European Union funding to add another five turbines alongside the existing model, engendering greater electrical production. ""The (initial) turbine is capable of producing 2MW (megawatts) instantaneously at any one time, given enough wind,"" says Alla Weinstein, CEO of Principal Power. ""This is equivalent to 1,300 households. The cumulative production thus far in Portugal has been 1.7GWh (gigawatt hours),"" she adds. See also: Wind turbine creates water from thin air . Unlike existing offshore wind farms and underwater tidal turbines, floating structures do not have to be permanently fixed to the ocean floor. Instead they are kept in place by a drag embedment anchor, much like the devices used to moor oil rigs in deep ocean environments. This means WindFloat structures could theoretically be transported to any ocean location where there is a strong wind resource, says Weinstein. An undersea cable transmits the energy produced on site back ashore. The costs for transporting electricity rise the further out to sea the structures are placed. ""We feel the ideal distance is out of sight from land, typically 12-18 miles,"" says Weinstein. ""This distance mitigates stakeholder visual concerns yet decreases the exposure to exorbitant transmission costs."" Weinstein highlights lower construction costs -- the WindPlus turbine cost â‚¬20 million ($24.9 million) to build and install -- as a major advantage the technology has over existing offshore wind farms. See also: Who's funding Green Energy . The fact that turbines and their platforms can be assembled on land (unlike bottom-fixed devices which are assembled at sea on specialized vessels and cost as much as $250,000 a day to charter) means ""the cost and risk profile ... is significantly reduced,"" she says. But while bullish about the technology's potential, Weinstein admits there remains a way to go before floating turbines become profitable enterprises. The initial structure off the coast of Portugal is merely a pilot installation to prove the device works and is viable, says Weinstein. ""At the moment we are making money but not enough to cover our costs,"" she says. ""There is no doubt in my mind however that this is going to be a profitable technology and profitable venture in the future. It just takes time.""","A floating wind turbine has been inaugurated off the coast of Agucadoura, Portugal .

"(CNN) -- A Cuban dissident who testified before Congress via video link from Havana last week was detained and beaten two days later, his wife said. Reached by phone in Cuba, Yris Tamara Pérez Aguilera said her husband was beaten in his cell and rendered unconscious by pepper spray. In spite of being warned of the risk of reprisals, Jorge Luis García Pérez, known as Antúnez, testified last Thursday, describing repressive conditions for dissidents in Cuba. ""We suffer beatings,"" he told the senators, ""torture, and all kinds of violations of our human rights."" In one activist's case, he asserted, ""the political police threatened to sexually abuse and rape her 6-year-old daughter."" He pleaded for support for what he called ""the resistance forces,"" as they engage in ""a head-on battle with the state."" By Friday, according to his wife, their house was surrounded, and on Saturday Antúnez was arrested. Once he was in custody, she claimed, he was beaten. Then, she said, ""the authorities came into his cell, and sprayed him inside the mouth with pepper spray, which cause him to lose consciousness"" for 15 minutes. According to another activist who was also incarcerated, she said, ""the state security agents told him, when they were attacking him, that he was going to pay very dearly for what he did."" Representatives for the Cuban government in Havana, Washington, and New York did not reply to requests for comment. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, who chaired the panel, said he warned the witnesses that they were taking a risk, and the committee did not disclose in advance the fact that dissidents would be testifying from Havana. And as the hearing came to a close, the senator warned Cuba against reprisals. But Sen. Menendez said he was aware that the witnesses could still be in danger -- especially when he saw who else was in attendance. ""There were members of the Castro regime at our hearing, who were in the audience,"" he said. ""They were taking notes."" Still, Aguilera said her husband does not regret testifying. ""He knew that some kind of repression would be brought against him for doing so,"" she said. ""However, he wanted to do it."" She said Antúnez, who is now 47, has been imprisoned a total of 17 years, off and on, by Cuban authorities since 1983. Aguilera said she too had been detained and beaten, when she went to the police station seeking her husband. She has since been released, she said, but her husband is still being held by Cuban authorities in Santa Clara.

"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (CNN) -- A man was gunned down Thursday in front of children at an elementary school as they were leaving for the day, local officials and witnesses told CNN. The shooting happened at 1 p.m. (3 p.m. ET), causing panic, witnesses said. Some parents waiting for their children at the time of the shooting also witnessed the attack. The school issued a statement saying the shooting was coincidental and was not connected to the school. The victim, 30, was shot nine times with a .45-caliber pistol by an unidentified gunman as he fled his attackers, according to the Chihuahua State Attorney General's Office. Witnesses said one attacker shot the victim inside the school next to a basketball court, while another attacker stood outside. A team of forensic experts rushed to the scene to conduct a survey, but could not determine if the man was already wounded before he entered the school. Police said the suspects remain at large. In the first nine months of 2011 there were 12,903 homicides in Mexico, according to official statistics. On Wednesday, the Mexican Attorney General's Office (PGR) said Juarez led the nation in homicides between January and September 2011, with a total of 1,206. Juarez saw a decline in the number of homicides in 2011, but is still considered to be a flashpoint in Mexico's drug cartel-related violence. There have been 18 homicides in Juarez in the first 12 days of 2012.","Some parents waiting to pick up their children witnessed the attack .

"(CNN) -- Chainsaws wailed Thursday in Granbury, Texas, as some residents began to clear fallen trees and whittle down the mounds of household goods strewn across the landscape, a testament to the ferocity of the previous night's tornadoes. But other residents, those from the hardest-hit neighborhoods, had to wait, hoping to hear when they could go back to their damaged and leveled homes to see what remains. Ronna Cotten said she has been told she can't re-enter her subdivision to ""check to see if we have any belongings left"" for at least two days, maybe as many as seven. Power is expected to be down for the next three weeks, Cotten said she was told. Cotten stayed in the home of a woman who picked her up from the rescue center Wednesday night and worked the phones Thursday trying to find hotel rooms for her family. She still considers herself fortunate. ""I feel very lucky because we are alive"" said the mother of four, who clutched a doorknob to keep the closet door shut as winds tore through her home. Rescue crews searched for seven people missing after the tornadoes struck this town in North Texas, killing at least six. A witness described getting an uncomfortably close view of the storm. ""One second you could see the whole roof collapse, and you could see the twister just there, basically,"" the man told CNN affiliate KTVT. ""It was horrible."" He and his family of five had crowded into the bathroom for shelter when the storm hit, he said. ""We were just watching the hail go by and then it just happened in the blink of an eye,"" a woman said. Nearby, a water heater was on its side; an upside-down car, its windows shattered and its silver skin crumpled, lay helpless in the dirt. A wheelchair lay in pieces a few feet away. Video shot from a helicopter showed rafters still intact, but the roofs they supported were gone. Hood County Sheriff Roger Deeds identified those killed as Jose Tovar Alvarez, 34; Marjari Davis, thought to be 82; Tommy Martin, 61; Leo Stefanski, 83; and Robert and Glenda Whitehead. Deeds said search and rescue operations to find survivors ""are pretty much winding down."" ""We're going to keep on looking,"" Deeds added. ""We're not going to give up until every piece of debris is turned over."" Rescuers had walked through the hardest-hit subdivision in Granbury ""over and over and over again,"" Deeds said earlier in the day. ""I'm confident we haven't left anybody behind, but we're still checking."" Granbury is 30 miles southwest of Fort Worth. The deaths occurred in a neighborhood of about 110 homes, many of which were built by Habitat for Humanity. Most of the homes in the Rancho Brazos subdivision were destroyed or damaged, the sheriff said. That is where the missing live, too, he said. Mayor Pro Tem Nin Hulett told CNN's Anderson Cooper that there were indications those people may be on vacation or in other areas, but officials were working to confirm that. People whose lives had been hit by the twisters were asking to get back to their homes, but the sheriff said he wasn't convinced it was safe for civilians to be in the area yet. Three people were taken to an area hospital, and 13 others were taken to hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, he said. Some of the patients had to have amputations, Dr. Kerri Sistrunk, head of the trauma unit at Lake Granbury Medical Center. Others suffered head injuries and open fractures, as well as minor abrasions, she said. At least 13 tornadoes touched down in the area, the National Weather Service said. A survey team said it found damage indicating an EF4 tornado had struck. That is the second-most severe classification on a scale of zero to five, . Several of the tornadoes struck Cleburne, about 30 miles east of Granbury. ""I was actually standing outside on my front porch and watched (a) tornado come across,"" Robert Barnett told CNN affiliate WFAA. ""I've seen tornadoes before -- I've chased them -- but I've never seen one like this. It freaked me out."" Another resident said he thought the storm had passed but was wrong. ""I went back outside and saw stuff flying by and said 'It's here! Let's go!'"" Darrin Vasquez told the station. He lost part of the roof on his home and when rain flooded in, a ceiling collapsed. WFAA said at least 12 homes lost their entire roofs. How to help . In nearby Ellis County, a suspected tornado knocked out power in the city of Ennis about midnight, said Steve Howerton, city manager. ""Several buildings in the downtown historic district have been seriously damaged,"" he said. ""There are a lot of traumatic injuries,"" said Donna Martin, a worker at a local veterans' organization. ""My husband told me that a car was lifted in the air. It just came in and hit so fast."" B.B. French, who lives on a canal three miles from where the worst of the damage occurred, said she was lucky. ""We had extreme winds,"" the 71-year-old resident said in a telephone interview. ""And then the sirens went off and then I got inside."" As lightning flashed and rain poured, she watched from inside her home as two mallards lay on the pavement. ""They just laid down on the sidewalk until the hail came, and then they were smart enough to waddle over and get underneath the roof"" of her boat deck. After the storm passed, French went outside to find that her neighbor on one side had lost a few shingles from his roof; on the other side, a neighbor had lost a couple of shutters; but her house was unscathed.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Two Spanish journalists experienced in covering wars have been kidnapped in Syria by a group linked to al Qaeda, the newspaper El Mundo said Tuesday. The two journalists -- El Mundo staff correspondent Javier Espinosa and freelance photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova -- were kidnapped September 16, foreign editor Ana Alonso told CNN. Garcia was traveling with Espinosa but not on assignment for El Mundo. After nearly three months of trying to secure their release quietly, El Mundo's top editor, Pedro J. Ramirez, said the paper, in conjunction with the family, decided to make public the kidnappings on December 10, which the United Nations designates annually as international Human Rights Day. ""Their captivity is a flagrant violation of human rights, of their free movement, and of all citizens who have the right to receive their information and images,"" Ramirez said at a Madrid news conference Tuesday. Espinosa, 49, and Garcia, 42, have made numerous trips to war-torn Syria, often together, and they organized their most recent visit together, Alonso said. Espinosa was previously kidnapped while covering a conflict in Sierra Leone, and Garcia was kidnapped last year in Syria for about 12 days, said Gervasio Sanchez, a Spanish veteran war photographer who knows both men, at the Madrid news conference. Both were subsequently released. This time, the newspaper and families got word through intermediaries that the two men were alive and being treated relatively well as of a month ago, in the same Syrian province where they were kidnapped. Ramirez said the paper believes both are still alive, although it is not clear if they are being held in the same location. Spain is involved in trying to secure the release of the two kidnapped journalists, but ""with absolute discretion,"" Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said Tuesday. The government is in ""constant contact with the families"" Garcia-Margallo told reporters at an event in Madrid, the Foreign Ministry said. Espinosa's wife, also a journalist, pleaded for the return of her husband and his colleague. ""Javier and Ricardo are not your enemy. Please, honor the revolution they protected, and set them free,"" Monica Prieto said during an emotional press conference in Beirut on Tuesday. ""Today we appeal to the Syrian people and all armed groups to help release Javier and Ricardo, who have always been committed to show the human face and suffering of the Syrian people during these very difficult times."" The newspaper reported the men were kidnapped at the Tal Abyad checkpoint in Raqqa province, close to the Turkish border, as they prepared to leave Syria after two weeks of coverage. Italian journalist held captive in Syria is headed home . Their captors are reported to be members of a group linked to the al Qaeda-backed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and have not revealed demands to free the two. Initially, the captors said they wanted to ensure the two journalists were not spies, El Mundo said. The journalists were traveling with four fighters from the Free Syrian Army, who were also kidnapped, but released 12 days later. The fighters were supposed to have provided protection to the Spaniards, the newspaper reported. Last year, Espinosa was in the same makeshift press center in Baba Amr, Homs province, where correspondent Marie Colvin of The Sunday Times of London and French photographer Remi Ochlik were killed. El Mundo reported an activist from Homs contacted the al Qaeda-linked captors to plead, unsuccessfully, for the release of the two Spanish journalists, telling them that Espinosa had helped evacuate wounded from Baba Amr last year. Another longtime Spanish war correspondent, Marc Marginedas, 46, was kidnapped in Syria on September 4, apparently by jihadi combatants near the city of Hama, his newspaper, El Periodico de Catalunya, reported on September 24.

"(CNN) -- Google+ has a problem. It's not engagement or the lack of a clear way to monetize itself. It's not those sometimes-unwieldy friend-organizing circles, or even the perception that no one other than nerds uses the service. The problem, its creators believe, is that many people keep comparing it to Facebook -- or, more broadly, social networks. While social interaction is a key part of Google+, the project is much more ambitious. Google+ is nothing short of a wholesale upgrade to all of Google's products and services, but with the identity of the user incorporated. Mashable sat down with Vic Gundotra, Google's senior vice president of social business, and Bradley Horowitz, Google+'s vice president of product, at the Google I/O developer conference. They were excited about the new Google+ features that were announced -- the Events feature and the new tablet app -- but they were also quick to downplay any comparisons to Facebook, or any suggestion that many people aren't interested in joining Google+. ""Google+ is just an upgrade to Google,"" says Gundotra. ""People have a hard time understanding that. I think they like to compare us with other social competitors, and they see us through that lens instead of really seeing what's happening: Google is taking its amazing products, and by bringing them together, they just become more awesome."" Gundotra and others have said this before, and you get the sense that they really believe in their recipe for Kool-Aid. Google also released some new statistics to parry any stabs at accusing the network of not having a large and engaged audience -- 250 million total users, with 150 million of them visiting every month, and half of those people signing in every day (if you're doing the math, that's 75 million daily active Plussers). Wading Into Google+'s Stream . But with the definition of Google+ so broad, what constitutes ""active daily use"" becomes a little hazy. If I'm signed into Google+ and simply do a Google search or upload a photo to Picasa, does that count? As Google defines the service, it would appear so. However, a user performing such basic Google tasks may never visit the Stream, Google+'s main social feature. That brings the question: Just how engaged are Google's users with the Stream? This week at I/O, Gundotra revealed that ""active"" users of Google+ spend an average of 12 minutes in the stream, up from 9 minutes three months ago. Still, that's not quite on par with Facebook, which sees its users spend a grand total of 10.5 billion total minutes spent on the network every day, according to its IPO filing. While that becomes about the same 12 minutes if you divide by Facebook's 900 million users, remember that we're talking about active users here, so Facebook's actual engagement is actually much higher. So since this area is actually where the comparison to Facebook is valid, how can Google both increase the proportion of active users as well as boost engagement on the Stream? ""That's a fair question,"" says Gundotra. ""I think there we boost engagement by giving people ways to connect things that they care about and are exciting — that nobody else has. Like Google hangouts. Like Events. Like beautiful photos."" Horowitz believes as more users ""upgrade"" to Google+ — which essentially just means letting Google know who you are — it'll become clear to them that Google's many services become much more useful. And at some point they'll find the Stream. ""When Google knows that I'm a man, and I live in this zip code, and I went to this school, and I have these interests, my entire experience gets better,"" he explains. ""You will discover our engagement is massive, and guess what? Your friends, family and loved ones are already here. It's not as if we need to acquire users. We just need to bring them into the light."" Money Money Money . The way Horowitz and Gundotra describe it, upgrading to Google+ is almost a religious conversion: You weren't really living (i.e. using Google) until you make the transition. Still, Google is a business, and it doesn't undertake massive projects like Google+ without some kind of plan to monetize them. So far, Google+ doesn't have anything like Twitter's trending topics (although it has a ""What's Hot"" stream that's a click or tap away for users) or Facebook's sponsored stories. When asked if we might someday see similar features introduced in Google+, Gundotra wouldn't say, but his change in manner betrays a disdain for how Google's competitors incorporate advertising. ""Our business model is very different,"" he says. Some of our competitors are like going to a baseball stadium. If you have 90,000 people there, you're going to put up ads everywhere, and that's basically the core business model. You're looking at a picture of your daughter, we're going to show you an ad. ""We have a very different philosophy. We think the right time to show and ad is when you are at the moment of commercial intent. When iIm doing a house remodel, and I'm looking for a microwave oven, then I see Bradley's +1 on a GE appliance, that means a lot more to me."" Gundotra repeated a statistic that Google has released before — that when brands use Google+'s social extensions in their ads, the click-through rate (CTR) jumps by 5-10%. While some have questioned that statistic, the fundamental idea of incorporating recommendations from friends into the ads they're seeing online makes a great deal of sense, and it's the business model of more than one company. Still, Gundotra won't rule out the possibility of sponsored stories down the road. ""We don't serve ads [on Google+], but that doesn't mean we won't have sponsored stories,"" he says. ""There may be more relevant forms of advertising that we do believe work."" The Business of Hangouts . There may be other sources of revenue for Google+, though. One of the much-touted advantages Google+ has over competitors (perceived or otherwise) is Hangouts — video chats you can have with multiple people, even through a mobile device and are absolutely free. Hangouts have been a major differentiator for Google+ since the beginning, but until recently Google had positioned them as a casual, consumer-friendly feature, not a business tool (a new ad for Hangouts shows a work group having a meeting). Since their introduction, many businesses (including Mashable) have adopted Hangouts for collaboration, and it begs the question: why hasn't Google been more proactive about courting business users? ""We hear this so much,"" says Horowitz. ""So many startups are running their business on Hangouts. Even big companies who would be embarrassed if I told you which ones. Their expansive camera units take longer to boot up than it takes to launch a hangout with commodity hardware and webcams in your laptop."" ""There are lots of examples of great consumer tech coming into the enterprise,"" Gundotra adds, ""because it's just so awesome. You could go back to 1991 with Windows. Enterprises really didn't want it, but it was just so great. If we can solve a problem for every human on earth, then businesses of course will use it."" So when will Google announce Hangouts for Business? ""We're very well aware of the opportunity in enterprise. We're not ignoring it. You should expect announcements from us in the future that add unique features that enterprises would need."" Google+'s Long Game . To some, Google+ made too many stumbles along the way to become a real Facebook competitor. As Gundotra and Horowitz see it, that's the wrong way of looking at it. Google+ is simply Google's way of taking its many disparate services — search, YouTube, Maps, etc. — and making them more relevant by incorporating the user's personal data. If some of those services then end up rubbing up against what Facebook offers, so be it. In the bigger picture of platforms, though, the comparison is more than appropriate. Both Facebook and Google want you to spend your time on their site, not the other's. Facebook began with social interaction and spread to broader services such as messaging. Google's taking it the other way around — creating a suite of extremely popular products and then persuading users to get social with them. Which approach is better? I don't think there's much question that Google's services improve greatly when you add in personal data, be it location, gender, interest or other factors.

"(CNN) -- The crazy life of Johnny Tapia -- a five-time world champion boxer who once wrote that he had been ""raised to fight to the death"" -- ended this week at age 45. ""A family member came home, found him deceased and called us,"" Officer Robert Gibbs, an Albuquerque, New Mexico, police spokesman, said Monday. Tapia's body was found Sunday night at his home in Albuquerque. Foul play is not suspected; an autopsy and toxicology tests will be carried out, Gibbs said. In his autobiography, ""Mi Vida Loca: The Crazy Life of Johnny Tapia,"" the fighter says that his father was murdered before he was born and that he was eight when he saw his mother murdered. ""She got stabbed 22 times with an ice pick and raped,"" he told ""In This Corner With James Smith"" in a 2004 interview. Relatives raised him and he followed in the footsteps of his grandfather, who had himself been a boxer. ""I was raised as a pit bull,"" he wrote in the book, which was co-authored by Bettina Gilois. ""Raised to fight to the death."" Tapia started boxing at age 9 and had his first amateur fight at 11. In 1988, he began is professional career, which was interrupted by bouts outside the ring with substance abuse followed by treatment in rehab centers. ""Four times I was declared dead. Four times they wanted to pull life support. And many more times I came close to dying. ""But I have lived and had it all. I have been wealthy and lost it all. I have been famous and infamous. Five times I was a world champion. You tell me. Am I lucky or unlucky?"" In 1990, he had just won a $1 million commercial for Pepsi when he ""tested dirty and got kicked out,"" losing his boxing license, said his wife and manager, Teresa Tapia, in the same 2004 interview. ""That's when I met him,"" she said. ""He was at his lowest, he was living on the streets. He did everything illegal that he could to make money. That was his life."" Fed up, she said, she locked him in her apartment, whose windows were covered with bars, and refused to let him out for six weeks while he broke free of the drugs' grip. ""All my goal is to see Johnny reach this ripe old age,"" she said. ""I mean, I'll take him until 80 or 90 years old."" Tapia claimed two Golden Gloves awards in addition to professional titles in several weight classes.","Tapia's body is found at his home on Sunday night .

"(CNN) -- Eurozone finance ministers Saturday granted a $13 billion bailout package to Cyprus as it grapples with a bloated financial sector that is threatening the region's economy. The Mediterranean Island's banking system has become ""fragile"" because of ""its very large size relative to the country's GDP"" and must be downsized, the Eurogroup said in a statement announcing the 10 billion euro bailout. Cyprus has a population of just over 1 million people, according to the World Bank, and has a reputation as a haven for offshore banking. At least 35 banks from around the world have branches there, according to the Central Bank of Cyprus. The Island will also have to agree to take steps to prevent money laundering, privatize the banking system and inject it with funds to recapitalize it, the according to the statement. All holders of bank accounts in Cyprus -- both residents and nonresidents -- will be required to pay a new tax. The Eurogroup projects the Island's public debt will reach 100% of gross domestic product in 2020. It is asking the International Monetary Fund to contribute to the bailout. The ministers deemed the deal necessary to stabilize the Cypriot economy and prevent damage to the closely connected Greek banking system.","Eurozone, IMF officials agree to Cyprus bail out .

"(CNN) -- I cried several times yesterday. This happened as I was reviewing scripts for CNN's upcoming coverage of the one-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut. I also cried as I reviewed a script about the bravery of Antoinette Tuff who single-handedly prevented a similar tragedy from occurring in a suburban Atlanta elementary school. I have an almost 8-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son. If I had lived in Newtown, my daughter could have been in one of the first-grade classrooms that was targeted. It is heartbreaking to think of what could have been and whether my children would have survived. My heart goes out to all of those who experienced such unthinkable loss. CNN was not involved in the Associated Press' litigation to gain release of the Newtown 911 calls, but I applaud the court's decision in support of open government and public access to government records. I have read and heard some of the powerful and emotional pleas of families, attorneys and their supporters who felt the 911 calls should have been withheld. Yet I fully believe that access to public records is crucial, even if painful. We can never learn the truth about our society and its ills and inspirations without full access to public documents. No matter how well-meaning public officials may be in withholding records, it should not be left to them to determine what our reality is. As a media lawyer, it is inevitable that I will be faced with advising on painful stories and the disturbing videos, images and sound that go along with them. We filed a lawsuit for access to the Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts, and we have recently gone to court to gain release of all records and data relating to the death of Valdosta, Georgia, teen Kendrick Johnson. Some images I cannot bear to look at -- or sounds to hear -- but I will do so because I know we are committed to shedding light on important stories and issues. And maybe one day those stories will make a difference and prevent future tragedies and suffering of other families. I realize not everybody is going to agree with how CNN handled the 911 calls, but one thing we can all agree on is that we need to hug our kids tighter. I did that as soon as I walked in the door from work yesterday evening. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of Johnita Due.","Johnita Due: As a mother, I understand the pain of events such as Newtown .

"(CNN) -- Ruslan Tsarni angrily condemned the alleged actions of his two nephews -- the two brothers suspected in the Boston Marathon bombings -- and after calling the bombers ""losers,"" the uncle urged the surviving nephew to turn himself in immediately. ""If you're alive, turn yourself in and ask for forgiveness from the victims,"" Tsarni said in front of reporters in a news conference outside his Montgomery County, Maryland, home. Hours later, Dzhokar Tsarnaev, 19, was captured in Watertown, Massachusetts. His brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died after an overnight shootout with police. The brothers come from an ethnic Chechen Muslim family, and Tsarni said the two nephews brought shame to his brother's family. The nephews are sons of Tsarni's brother, and Tsarni last saw his nephews in December 2005. ""You put a shame on our entire family -- the Tsarnaev family -- and you put a shame on the entire Chechen ethnicity,"" Tsarni said. When asked what provoked the bombing suspects, the uncle stated: ""Being losers, hatred to those who were able to settle themselves -- these are the only reasons I can imagine. ""Anything else, anything else to do with religion, with Islam, is a fraud, is a fake,"" Tsarni said. ""Somebody radicalized them, but it's not my brother who just moved back to Russia, who spent his life bringing bread to their table, fixing cars. He didn't have time or chance or anything, options. He's been working,"" Tsarni said, referring to the men's father. Tsarni says he teaches his own children to love the United States because it gives a chance to everyone ""to be treated as a human being."" He spoke to reporters because he wanted to express condolences to the Boston Marathon bombing victims and their families, he said. Two blasts Monday killed three people and injured more than 100 gathered at the home stretch and finish line. ""We share with them their grief,"" Tsarni said. ""I'm ready just to meet with them.

"(CNN) -- The deal struck at the weekend between Iran and world powers over its nuclear program is not just a triumph of Western diplomacy, but a step forward in the budding rapprochement between Iran and the U.S. that had been long in the making. Every U.S. administration from Reagan to Obama has tried to reach out to Iran. Unfortunately, these efforts all failed because the circumstances for rapprochement were not quite right -- unlike today, where Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, has been determined to outflank his ideological opponents in Tehran and reach a deal with the West. The Obama administration seems equally determined -- despite opposition from Saudi Arabia and Israel, as well as an obstructive Congress -- to welcome the Iranians back into the international community, so long as they agree to play by the rules. This is Obama's ""opening to China"" moment and he must seize it. Ever since Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979 and initiated the 444-day Iran-hostage crisis, the United States and Iran have been regional arch-nemeses. Even so, in the thirty years since this traumatic event, there have been periodic efforts to improve relations. The first episode occurred in 1985 when Israeli officials helped facilitate a back-channel approach to so-called Iranian ""moderates"", represented by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. This led to the infamous ""Mission to Tehran"", where senior U.S. officials traveled to Tehran to trade weapons and spare parts in exchange for the release of American hostages held in Lebanon. This mission failed spectacularly. Details were leaked to the press, leading to the Iran-Contra scandal, which nearly brought the Reagan administration down. After George H.W. Bush's election in 1988, the U.S. reached out to Iran once again, saying in his inaugural address, ""Goodwill begets goodwill"". Bush implied that if the Iranian regime helped the U.S. obtain the release of the hostages, he would respond with gestures of goodwill. Upon Rafsanjani's election as president in June 1989, he announced that he would help the U.S. obtain the release of the hostages, which was done in late 1991. But goodwill did not beget goodwill. When the hostages were released, the U.S. did not do anything. During Clinton's first term, U.S.-Iranian relations first underwent a deep chill. Following the Gulf War, the U.S. sought to ""contain"" Iran and Iraq, even though Iran had disarmed itself following the Iran-Iraq War. The policy, known as ""Dual Containment"", was confusing. It advocated America playing a costly balancing role, when in fact the U.S. needed Iran to balance Iraq and vice versa. But the landslide election of Mohammad Khatami in 1997 led to a major thaw in U.S.-Iranian relations. Like Rouhani today, Khatami sought to open up to the U.S., telling CNN that ""all doors should now be open for such dialogue and understanding and the possibility for contact between Iranian and American citizens."" Clinton seized this opportunity and exchanged letters with the Iranians in 1999, but regime hardliners undercut Khatami and rejected the American overture. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Iranian people -- much to the surprise of U.S. officials -- poured into the streets in solidarity with the American people. As U.S. officials prepared for war they were shocked to find Iran ready to help. According to Bruce Reidel, a former U.S. official, the U.S. and Iran worked closely together after the toppling of the Taliban to establish the post-war Afghan government. Unfortunately, George W. Bush squandered whatever goodwill had been achieved by including Iran as part of the so-called ""Axis of Evil. Â» . Even so, the U.S. still made progress on the nuclear issue. In May 2003, Iran sought to trade Western acceptance of its right to a peaceful nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, assistance in stabilizing Iraq, and cooperation against al-Qaeda. But the U.S. rejected Iran's proposal, undermined the Khatami government, and ruined any chance of achieving a lasting deal. When Barack Obama came to office in 2009 there was great optimism that he could achieve a major breakthrough. This was because Obama had indicated during his election campaign that he was willing to talk directly with Iran. In March 2009, Obama sought to bolster moderates inside Iran in the lead up to the June 2009 election by speaking directly to the Iranian people. Unfortunately, the regime's hardliners had no interest in seeing another reformist return to power and rigged the election, crushed the civic-minded protests against the regime, and ushered in another four year term for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The election of Rouhani in June 2013 has turned U.S.-Iranian relations on its head. Like Khatami in 1997, Rouhani stunned the West with a charm offensive, condemning Syria's use of chemical weapons, wishing Jews a happy Rosh Hashana, and releasing political prisoners. Rouhani's objective was clear: he wanted sanctions relief in exchange for a compromise over his country's nuclear program. To this end, he found a willing partner in Obama. This remarkable opening culminated in Obama's famous telephone call to Rouhani at the end of the UN General Assembly in late-September, the first direct communication between American and Iranian leaders since 1979. These exchanges set the stage for the nuclear deal reached over the weekend. After decades of intense hostility between the U.S. and Iran, calmer heads have finally prevailed. Only time will tell if the U.S. and Iran can build upon this interim agreement and establish a working relationship, which is in the best interests of the region. More importantly, this deal stands as a lesson to the war hawks that diplomacy actually works. INTERACTIVE: Nuclear weapons: Who has what?

"(CNN) -- Criminal suspects claimed embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford tried to buy a damaging video -- months before a tape was publicized showing him smoking crack -- according to court documents released Wednesday. The documents obtained from Ontario Crown Counsel Arielle Elbaz are tied to a Canadian investigation into organized crime called Project Traveller. Ford wasn't the focus of this investigation, and he has not been charged with a crime. But, after allegedly interacting with several players who were involved in the probe, he ended up getting ensnared in it. The mayor's camp did not immediately return a CNN request for comment Wednesday night on the latest allegations. According to the documents, police translating a March 27 phone conversation primarily from the Somali language believed that the men were talking about ""receiving an offer from Rob Ford in exchange for a video."" The men discussed an apparent offer of $5,000 and a car in exchange for the video, as well as selling the tape to the Toronto Star newspaper and an unnamed website. The court documents state: ""At the end of the discussion, (one of the men) said he does not want to go to the media but would just see him (believed to be referring to Ford), ... He says he'll ask for 100 or 150"" -- possibly referring to $100,000 or $150,000. These conversations don't delve into specifics about what's on the video. But earlier this year, allegations surfaced in two media outlets that Ford had been recorded last winter using crack cocaine. In May, the Star and the website Gawker published stories saying their reporters saw 90 seconds of a cell-phone video showing Ford, as the Star described it, ""inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe."" Later in the video -- as described by the Star -- an ""incoherent"" man both the Star and Gawker claimed was Ford ranted on a number of subjects. After that report came out, Ford said he no reason to resign. Yet pressure on him increased earlier this fall when the Canadian city's police chief announced investigators had recovered a video that purportedly showed Ford smoking a crack pipe. The next week, on November 5, Ford admitted that he'd ""smoked crack cocaine ... probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago."" He denied being an addict. Ford says he didn't lie about crack use . Even after this admission, Ford refused to resign. Instead he vowed ""outright war"" on the city council when, later in the month, it slashed the mayor's budget and transferred most of his duties to the deputy mayor. ""If you think American-style politics is nasty, you guys have just attacked Kuwait,"" Ford said then to groans and laughter in the city council chambers. The mayor's voice is less apparent in the documents released Wednesday, although he is not necessarily insignificant. Toronto mayor's rant caught on video . Authorities say that phone intercepts from early on April 20, for instance, indicate one woman telling a man ""that Rob Ford is at the residence."" Two minutes later, at 12:54 a.m., another man allegedly tells the first ""to go to Princess's ... house to deliver drugs to Rob Ford,"" the court documents say. One of the men says around 2:18 a.m. that Ford was doing drugs, and that the other man ""told him to take a picture of that because of what it would be worth,"" according to the official account. ""(This other man) says that the Mayor of the City Rob Ford was smoking his rocks today,"" police said of another phone conversation from shortly before 6 a.m. that April morning. Later that day, Ford was out helping clean up a city park. He was without his cell phone, the documents said, citing remarks by the mayor's staff, with indications that he had either left it or had it taken by those people he'd been with hours before.

"(CNN) -- Mexico's poor form in qualifying for the 2014 World Cup has cost coach Jose Manuel ""Chepo"" de la Torre his job. The 47-year-old's assistant Luis Fernando Tena will take charge for Tuesday's crunch clash with the United States in Ohio, following Friday's 2-1 home defeat by Honduras. The reverse, just Mexico's second in 77 qualifying matches at Estadio Azteca, left the Olympic champion in fourth place in the CONCACAF group and struggling to earn an automatic place at the showpiece tournament in Brazil next year. Only the top three teams have direct qualification -- the fourth finisher must play Oceania winner New Zealand in a playoff. De la Torre said after the Honduras match that he would not resign, but the Mexican football federation announced Saturday that his two-year tenure was over in a brief statement on its website. He led Mexico to victory in the 2011 Gold Cup, but the team lost in this year's semifinals and also struggled at the Confederations Cup in Brazil -- a rehearsal tournament for the main event next July. Mexico has qualified for every World Cup since 1994, reaching the round of 16 on each of those occasions. The Americans, meanwhile, dropped to second place after losing 3-1 against Costa Rica, despite Clint Dempsey scoring on his 100th international appearance. The home side earned revenge for March's snow-affected 1-0 defeat in Denver, as goals from Johnny Acosta, Celso Borges and Joel Campbell put Costa Rica one-point clear at the top with three games to play. Panama could have moved above Mexico, but only drew 0-0 with 10-man Jamaica -- with Rodolph Austin sent off in the second half. In South American qualifying, Colombia joined Argentina on 26 points at the top after Friday's 1-0 win over fourth-placed Ecuador. James Rodriguez scored the only goal in the first half, while Ecuador earlier had Gabriel Achilier sent off and then missed a second-half penalty by Walter Ayovi. It guaranteed Colombia at least a playoff place, and hope of a first World Cup appearance since 1998. The top four teams go through automatically. Chile moved up to third with a 3-0 win over Venezuela, while Luis Suarez scored both goals as Uruguay climbed to fifth with a 2-1 win away to Peru. In Africa, Ethiopia ended South Africa's hopes by beating Central African Republic 2-1 in Congo on Saturday. South Africa, the 2010 World Cup host, failed to make the final round of qualifying despite finishing its Group A campaign in second after a 4-1 win over Botswana. Burkina Faso went through as Group E winner after a 1-0 win over Gabon meant second-placed Congo missed out, having drawn 2-2 away to Niger. Nigeria won Group F after beating second-placed Malawi 2-0 at Calabar, while on Friday Ghana also qualified -- joining Algeria, Egypt and Ivory Coast in the five two-leg playoffs to be held in October and November.","Mexico coach Jose Manuel de la Torre sacked ahead of United States trip .

"(Mental Floss) -- Most guys pull them on every morning when they step out of the shower. In fact, at this very moment, there's probably nothing closer to you than your underwear. It's taken thousands of years to perfect the boxers or briefs that you're wearing right now, though, so here's a brief and incomplete look at the history of men's underwear: . Loincloths offer some coverage . The first known underwear dates back almost 7000 years, when prehistoric man used leather to cover and protect his loins while running prehistoric errands. For several millennia, not much changed. Ancient Egyptian art shows everyone from the pharaohs on down the line decked out in loincloths of their own. The pharaohs even wore a sort of specialized kilt/loincloth called a shendoh, and took extra supplies of the garment into their pyramids for use in the afterlife. Codpieces become all the rage . Variations on the loincloth seem to have persisted into the Middle Ages, when loose-fitting trousers called braies came into fashion. These linen duds extended from the waist to around mid-calf, and once the wearer stepped into his breeches he had to lace them tight around his waist and shins. Although all of the tying wasn't so convenient, these braies had the advantage of offering a lot of coverage, so if a laborer got too hot he could strip down to his skivvies while still maintaining some sense of decorum. On the other hand, all of the lacing and cinching made answering nature's call a bit of a hassle. Enter the codpiece. A codpiece that opened at the front using buttons, snaps, or laces enabled men to urinate without removing their braies, which really came in handy when you'd had a bit too much mead. Mental Floss: 6 articles of clothing that caused riots . These early codpieces were practical, but as hemlines rose, they started to take on a decorative function, too. When Henry VIII began to pad his codpiece in the 16th century, all of his loyal subjects followed suit. (Nevermind that scholars later speculated that Henry VIII's bulging codpiece may not have actually been male overcompensation -- it may have been oversized to accommodate medication-soaked bandages to alleviate some of the pain from a suspected case of syphilis. It's worth noting that modern scholars have mostly dismissed this theory.) Codpiece padding and growth continued throughout the mid-sixteenth century before tailing off around 1590. Prizefighters get stretchy . ""Boxers or briefs?"" Before the 1920s, this question would have gotten you little more than a blank look, mostly because neither boxers nor briefs had been invented yet. From Victorian times into the 1930s, men had mostly worn tight-fitting knee-length flannel ""drawers"" beneath their pants and donned similarly snug flannel tops as undershirts. This state of affairs doesn't sound too comfy, but things got a little more breathing room in 1925. Jacob Golomb, the founder of the venerable boxing equipment company Everlast, started to tweak designs for the trunks worn by pugilists. Golomb realized that the leather-belted trunks fighters had been wearing weren't totally ideal, so he replaced the leather with more flexible elastic waistbands. Boxer shorts weren't an immediate success as underwear, though. They lacked the support that drawers and union suits had offered, so men weren't crazy about them. It really wasn't until after World War II that boxer shorts took off to challenge their younger siblings, the briefs. Mental Floss: A brief history of shaving . Postcard ispires tighty whities . Underwear drawers changed forever in 1934 when Arthur Kneibler, an executive and designer at the Wisconsin hosiery company Coopers, Inc., received a postcard from a friend who was visiting the French Riviera. The postcard depicted a man in a bikini-style bathing suit, and ""apparel engineer"" Kneibler had an epiphany: couldn't this type of swimsuit be converted into underwear? After some experimentation, Kneibler introduced a new kind of snug, legless underwear with an overlapping Y-front fly. Coopers dubbed the new product ""Jockey shorts"" because the high level of support the garment offered was reminiscent of jockstraps. Coopers took its first batch of Jockey briefs to Chicago's landmark department store Marshall Fields on January 19, 1935. Although the weather was awful?Chicago was in the grip of a blizzard?the entire load of 600 pairs of Jockeys sold out on the first day. Within three months, the company sold 30,000 pairs of Jockey shorts. Coopers kept making and marketing its wildly successful underwear, and in 1971 the company changed its name to Jockey. Secret Service gives Joe Boxer a boost . Designer underwear became all the rage in the 1970s and 80s as labels like Calvin Klein began to transform our drawers from something we hid under our pants into the sort of fashion and lifestyle choice one could flaunt in a bad music video. Cuts became tighter and sexier, and underwear designs became flashy, loud, and often humorous. One of the main beneficiaries of this new obsession with snappy underwear was Joe Boxer, which started making skivvies in 1984 when it filled an order for Macy's that included a design with a Velcro-attached removable raccoon tail. Joe Boxer really jumped into the spotlight in 1985, though, when it made boxers printed with the image of hundred-dollar bills. The Secret Service decided that these duds violated forgery laws and confiscated 1,000 pairs of the offending underwear. Instead of simply hiring lawyers, Joe Boxer turned the seizure into a lighthearted news event, and the image of boxers as a playful alternative to stolid briefs grew. Mental Floss: Symbolism and the $1 bill . Underwear takes the nation's economic pulse . Although there haven't been many huge underwear breakthroughs since the introduction of boxer briefs in the early 1990s (and even those are sort of a throwback to the union suits favored by pre-1930s men), boxers and briefs found their way onto the financial pages in early 2008. That's when former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan revealed that the state of the men's underwear industry is an important indicator of the economy's health. The logic Greenspan outlined regarding underwear was both simple and elegant. Most guys have a drawer full of fairly ratty underwear that they'll wear until the elastic is dead and the boxers are riddled with holes. Since coworkers and friends generally don't see a guy's underwear, replacing these frayed undergarments often seems like a discretionary purchase for men. As such, when men start fearing the economy is in a downturn and need a place to save a little cash, they simply stop replenishing their underwear drawer with fresh Jockeys. Sounds reasonable enough, right? Sure enough, when the economy started to tail off in 2008, annual men's underwear sales dropped by 12 percent. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- The 34-year-old dental hygienist from Stamford, Connecticut, had just rammed her black luxury car through barricades and into police cruisers near the U.S. Capitol, one of Washington's securest areas. In the car with Miriam Carey was her 1-year-old daughter. Police say Carey then sped down Pennsylvania Avenue before crashing. Two law enforcement officers were injured during the incident, and officers fatally shot her. But was the shooting of the unarmed woman justified? Had Carey been shot a few moments earlier, such as when police had surrounded her car and she drove into them or as she sped off, it would have been justified because she had used her car as a deadly weapon, pointing it at the officers, said Mark O'Mara, a CNN legal analyst. But if the shooting occurred after the car stopped and if Carey had gotten out, as some accounts unconfirmed by CNN have suggested, that changes things, he said. ""If she did not turn on them like she was going for a gun, something to at that point say the threat is ongoing and immediate and imminent, then maybe the police should have taken a breath, waited,"" O'Mara said. Opinion: Did D.C. cops have to shoot to kill? They would have quickly determined that she posed no threat, he said. What if police fear a terrorist bomber? But Maki Haberfeld, chairwoman of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said police would have had no way of knowing whether Carey posed a threat as she got out of the car, and therefore the shooting was justified. ""We live in times of heightened alert as far as terrorist activities are concerned,"" she said. ""The fact that she was not displaying a gun doesn't mean anything, because bombers don't necessarily display anything. They have the explosives around their waist, usually. ""It's a matter of a split-second decision that the police officer needs to take before someone explodes himself. It's all about the larger context. They just push the button, or it could be activated from a remote location."" CNN law enforcement analyst Mike Brooks said the police had no choice but to shoot. ""You don't know if she has a bomb,"" he said. ""You don't know if it's a terrorist attack. The officers just don't know."" Brooks dismissed suggestions that police could have defused the situation simply by shooting out the car's tires. ""If you are using deadly force, you are there to try to incapacitate the driver of that car -- of that weapon,"" he said. ""If they did shoot the tires out, the car can keep moving."" And the handguns used by Capitol Police might not have done the job, according to CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes. ""These tires are synthetically wrapped, like Kevlar, like a bulletproof vest,"" he said. He noted that law enforcement officers were acutely aware that the incident was occurring near some of the nation's most sensitive sites. ""We're not talking about some cornfield in Nebraska,"" he said. ""We're talking about downtown Washington, D.C."" Fuentes said officers had to consider whether the woman had explosives in her car: ""Is she just looking for a large gathering of people that she can drive up close to them and explode a bomb?"" Carey's family is questioning whether shooting Miriam Carey was the only way to end the chase. ""We want to know if protocols were followed,"" family attorney Eric Sanders said on CNN's AC360. ""... We are going to conduct our investigation, and we are not going to go with just what the government said."" Rules have changed since 9/11 . After the September 11 attacks, police chiefs reconsidered whether the usual rules of using lethal force were sufficient to deal with people who might detonate a bomb when confronted by police. The U.S. Capitol Police adopted a suicide bomber policy in 2004. Then-chief Terrance W. Gainer told The Washington Post in 2005 that Capitol officers were trained to shoot a suspected bomber who refused to stop and be searched. The Capitol Police public affairs office could not be reached Friday night to confirm whether that policy remains in place. The International Association of Chiefs of Police issued guidelines for coping with suicide bombers in 2005, including a recommendation that officers need not wait until the threat is imminent before using deadly force. Within weeks of that report, London police officers using a similar policy shot and killed a man they had wrestled to the floor of a train because they incorrectly suspected he had a bomb. Anti-terrorism policies often allow officers to fire without warning a suspect to surrender because a warning might simply alert the bomber to detonate. Sheri H. Mecklenburg, an assistant U.S. attorney, wrote in the magazine of the international police chiefs group in 2007 that Americans are accustomed to debates about whether a suspect made an overt threat to harm someone. ""In the context of suicide bombers, however, this debate is irrelevant. Suicide bombers always pose an imminent threat of death and serious injury, whether they are moving toward or fleeing from their target, for at any time they may detonate,"" Mecklenburg wrote. CNN's David Simpson and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","NEW: Capitol police adopted policy to shoot bomb suspects in 2004 .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Disney star Demi Lovato had an ""altercation"" with a dancer on her concert tour before dropping out of the show to seek help with what her publicist called ""emotional and physical issues,"" a source close to Lovato's camp said Tuesday. Lovato left the world tour with the Jonas Brothers and checked into an inpatient treatment center last weekend, a statement released by her publicist said Monday. The altercation with the dancer, which the source did not describe, may have led to Lovato's decision to leave, the source said. The same source denied media reports that Lovato fought with actress Ashley Greene, the current girlfriend of Joe Jonas. Lovato recently suffered a public end to a short romance with Jonas, one of the three brothers she had been traveling the world with. ""Demi Lovato left her tour early this weekend in order to seek medical treatment for emotional and physical issues she has dealt with for some time,"" the publicist's statement said. The publicist cautioned against describing the treatment as ""rehab."" ""Demi has decided to take personal responsibility for her actions and seek help,"" the statement said. ""She is doing just that."" The entourage was scheduled to perform in Chile, Brazil and Argentina over the next two weeks. ""She regrets not being able to finish her tour, but is looking forward to getting back to work in the near future,"" the statement said. No act will be added to replace Lovato on the tour, which has only six shows remaining, a source close to the Jonas Brothers said. The 18-year-old singer-actress has talked extensively about being bullied while in middle school. ""People say sticks and stones may break your bones, but names can never hurt you, but that's not true,"" Lovato wrote on a anti-bullying website last month. ""Words can hurt. They hurt me. Things were said to me that I still haven't forgotten."" Along with her solo music career, Lovato co-starred in Disney's ""Camp Rock"" movies.

"(CNN) -- Recent headlines make clear that the American public is troubled by government secrecy. But what should be done to address these concerns is less clear. Some argue that there ought to be little or no government secrecy because citizens must be kept fully informed of what public officials are up to. But this stance makes little sense since the government has to collect secret intelligence and conduct covert operations in order to preserve national security. We do not want Iran to build nuclear weapons, or North Korea to refine its missile technology, or al Qaeda to launch another attack, or for the Middle East to descend into war. To confront these threats and challenges we need the NSA and CIA to keep tabs on foreign powers and organizations. Since we cannot do without intelligence, and the secrecy this requires, the sensible thing to do, it would seem, is to bolster the checks and balances that can prevent the misuse of such powers. But this is easier said than done. Consider the difficulties that arise when lawmakers and judges are tasked with overseeing covert activities. Presidents often feel uncomfortable sharing secrets with Congress, because its members have been known to disclose information in order to score partisan political points. Meanwhile judges tend to defer to the government's claims about what needs to be kept secret in the national interest because they believe they lack the expertise and the authority to second-guess intelligence agencies. A common response to these difficulties has been to urge lawmakers and courts to do more. Congress ought to compel the executive to share secret information, the argument goes, and judges ought to cultivate greater expertise in intelligence matters or draw upon outside experts. But this advice overlooks a deeper problem -- often there is no obviously ""right"" answer about what should be concealed or disclosed. In order to determine what should be made public it is necessary to balance often uncertain costs and benefits. For example, revealing how Angela Merkel is targeted by surveillance operations might better inform public debate on surveillance but it might also allow Kim Jong-Un to better evade American surveillance. Does the benefit outweigh the cost? Much depends on the facts, and therefore on the political judgment and moral sensibilities of officials who have access to the facts. The uncertainties surrounding covert activities may lead us to think that we can prevent secrecy from being used to conceal wrongdoing by being careful about whom we appoint to exercise and oversee secrecy. But it isn't quite that easy. We cannot be entirely confident about the quality of oversight provided by those whom we task with monitoring secret activities, since such oversight must itself be conducted in secret. How then to tell if those whom we select are dispassionate and thoughtful when we cannot see how they are doing their jobs? An example might make this point clearer. Recently the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) has come under criticism for authorizing surveillance by the NSA. Did the FISC act reasonably? We cannot be certain because the confidential nature of its deliberations prevents a full telling of the story. This doesn't mean the FISC is untrustworthy -- were the facts able to be made public, the critics' fears that it acted subserviently might prove entirely unjustified. There is another way to guard against the abuse of secrecy. There is the distinct possibility that if something wrongful is done secretly, someone in the chain of command will make the wrongdoing public. Such disclosures can take the form of whistleblowing (when government employees complain openly) or leaking (when they disclose evidence anonymously). There are many well known examples of such unauthorized disclosures. Recall for instance Mark Felt's disclosures that helped bring down the Nixon administration, or the leaks that revealed the existence of so-called CIA ""black sites"" (or secret prisons) during the so-called War on Terror, or the complaint by Sergeant Joseph Darby that exposed prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib. The fact that whistleblowers, leakers, and reporters can act as ""fire alarms"" has led to their being valorized in the news media. As a result, when the Obama administration has taken action against government employees that have disclosed classified information, and subpoenaed the Associated Press' telephone records, it has been accused of waging a ""war on whistleblowers"" and undermining the First Amendment. But once again we must be careful. Brave whistleblowers like Darby deserve our support and praise. However we should not overlook the possibility that some government employees disclose information in order to settle scores or to further their own preferred policies. Nor should we forget that the press profits from scandal, which gives it a strong incentive to sensationalize and exaggerate. Of course the motives of leakers, whistleblowers, and the reporters that cover them are not particularly relevant when they expose unquestionably criminal activity. Felt's motivations when he disclosed what he knew about Watergate seem quite irrelevant for instance. But a government employee's motives -- and a reporter's incentives -- do matter when they disclose secret information concerning activities whose alleged illegality and immorality is doubtful. At times their claims can be quite weak. Consider for instance Edward Snowden's claim that he disclosed NSA secrets because he ""witnessed systemic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act."" This claim does not justify his revealing U.S. surveillance of Chinese or German leaders. There are no laws prohibiting countries from spying on each other. Snowden apparently believes that spying is immoral, but then why did he agree to work at the NSA? And more importantly, why is he entitled to impose his ideological beliefs on Americans who would prefer that we keep tabs on Chinese and European leaders especially since those countries spy on Americans? Snowden also claims that his revelations have been ""a public service"" because they have increased public ""knowledge"" of surveillance activities. But has public knowledge really increased? The NSA cannot present its side of the story because it needs to protect the methods it uses. So we only have half the story. Moreover, Snowden's desire to foster public debate about surveillance is naive. An open discussion on what kinds of surveillance activities should be out of bounds alerts foreign powers and organizations about which communications channels it would be safe for them to use. For example, if the U.S. declares that it will refrain from cracking the encryption systems used by Apple or Google, won't that encourage al Qaeda to use iPhones and Gmail to communicate? So to answer the question we started out with, the public's approach to government secrecy ought to be a measured one. We ought to recognize that secrecy can be necessary for national security, and we ought to take responsibility for the people we appoint to exercise secrecy on our behalf. We ought to welcome unauthorized disclosures when they reveal unquestionably criminal activity. At the same time, we ought to remember that the watchmen that guard against the misuse of this secrecy, including whistleblowers and reporters, might themselves behave less than sensibly. The opinions expressed are solely those of Rahul Sagar.","We ought to recognize that secrecy can be necessary for national security, Sagar writes .

"(CNN) -- Jason Collins is a big, end-of-bench bruiser who can harangue opposing centers. And he's gay. Only one of those things matters -- at least publicly -- to NBA teams that might be considering his services for the 2013-14 season after his highly publicized coming out on Monday. ""He's a weird player in a sense,"" said Michael Lee, who covers the Wizards, Collins' latest career stop, for The Washington Post. ""He's nothing spectacular, never stood out, but he's still an effective player in terms of what he does."" That rÃ©sumÃ© includes physical defense and an ability to bang in the paint with imposing big men like Dwight Howard and Brook Lopez, as well as a willingness to dish out all six of his fouls, Lee said. It includes a strong basketball IQ, a team mentality and a few other intangibles, such as the ability to set screens. ""I've had players tell me, 'When he comes to set a screen, you're going to get open,' "" Lee said. Opinion: Here's to Collins -- and the NBA . What it does not include is the ability to fill up a stat sheet. Over 12 seasons, he has a career average of 3.6 points per game, and he hasn't averaged more than 2 points a games since his 2006-07 season as a New Jersey Net. Many 7-footers who fill the lane are known for their blocking or rebounding ability, but despite being taken in the first round of the 2001 draft, out of Stanford, Collins has never averaged more than 6.1 rebounds a game (during the 2004-05 season at that), and he's never been a prodigious shot blocker. There's been much talk about what it means for basketball and the LGBT community if he's not signed after coming out, but Lee said he feels that teams will be more concerned with his 35th birthday coming in December and that he appeared in only six games, averaging 10 minutes per outing, for the Wizards. He'll also command almost $1.4 million, the NBA minimum salary for a player with 10 or more years in the league. ""That will go against him more than sexual orientation,"" Lee said. Lance Bass gave Collins advice on coming out . That's not to say that there isn't a place for him in the NBA. Even if he isn't picked up ahead of next season, a team may seek his services as injuries pile up and the February trade deadline nears. Von DuBose, an Atlanta-based attorney and NFL contract negotiator who has represented NBA players in off-the-court matters, likens Collins to Marcus Camby or Juwan Howard, a fraternity of ""bigger post guys who don't rely on their quicks or perimeter play to survive."" Sure, Camby and Howard had more impressive career stats, but as they've grown older -- Camby is 39, Howard 40 -- they've settled into more utilitarian roles, coming off the bench for a few minutes a game. While most of the reaction to Collins' announcement has been positive, DuBose said it's possible his sexual orientation could affect his future, especially if an NBA general manager feels his team is too immature to handle the addition of the league's first openly gay player. ""That GM, without divulging publicly that he had considered it, may go in a different direction,"" DuBose said. Collins needs to go to a team with solid structure and an assertive coach and GM, Lee said. A cast of veterans will also help, as older players are more likely to be focused on winning than on whining about a teammate being gay. ""It'll probably have to be a veteran team that just needs a piece at the end of its bench,"" Lee said. While it's unclear, despite the myriad messages of support, what will happen if and when Collins next steps into a locker room, Lee said Collins has garnered a lot of good will, credibility and respect during his dozen years in the league. He's a leader, and his teammates have always liked him, he said. On the flip side of that equation, Lee and DuBose don't foresee a team picking up Collins because he's gay, as that would immediately devalue him among his teammates. Brazile: But can the dude play? ""I don't think people were tuning in to see Jason Collins play,"" DuBose said. ""They may never see him play anyway. He's probably not going to get a ton of minutes."" For the moment, though, Collins is the subject of intense attention that has nothing to do with his basketball prowess. ""He's in the process of taking ownership over the here and now, which is actually coming out,"" Carolyn Moos, a Stanford grad and former WNBA player who dated Collins for eight years, told CNN's Piers Morgan on Tuesday night. ""And that can be very, I assume, overwhelming."" Moos says it will be a process, much like it was for her after Collins called off their 2009 engagement and upon learning -- in calls he made to her starting this past weekend -- that her longtime love, with whom she'd planned a marriage and a family, was gay. ""I hope (it) is a natural progression for him,"" Moos said, as he becomes more comfortable with himself. I think time will allow more perspective on it as well."" Collins newfound stature in the gay rights movement, and the public eye, may open the door to some opportunities, such as off-the-court lessons on inclusiveness, DuBose said. Spike Lee slams the Collins hate machine . But he didn't see how that would translate into additional revenue. Wizards spokesman Scott Hall said that while every jersey the club sold Monday had Collins' name on it, ""it was not a large amount."" ""I think it would be a terrible move to try to sign him for financial gain or rating,"" Lee said. ""He has too much respect for himself to be used for something other than what he is, which is a basketball player."" At least one NBA executive, Golden State Warriors President and COO Rick Welts, who in 2011 became the first openly gay American sports executive, said he doesn't think Collins' announcement will have any effect on him being signed for the 2013-14 season. ""I think whatever percentage chance Jason had of being on an NBA roster when he woke up yesterday is probably identical this morning,"" he said. ""Actually, I'll take that back. ... If he was 7 feet tall yesterday morning, my guess is with the weight that was lifted off his shoulders yesterday, he is probably 7'2"", so that might improve his chances.""

"(CNN) -- An Iranian court has sentenced the so-called ""blogfather"" of Iran to 19½ years in prison, the semi-official Mashregh news website said Tuesday. Hossein Derakhshan was ""convicted of cooperating with enemy states, making propaganda against the Islamic system of government, promoting small anti-revolutionary groups, managing obscene web sites and insulting Islamic sanctities,"" Mashregh reported. The 35-year-old Canadian-Iranian blogger and activist was also banned from journalistic endeavors and from joining any political parties for five years. Derakhshan was arrested on November 1, 2008, and is being held at the Evin Prison in Tehran, reported the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. Hamed Derakhshan, Hossein Derakhshan's brother, was shocked when he discovered the news of Hossein Derakhshan's sentence from an online news report. ""It targets exactly freedom of speech and expression. Maybe they are trying to make an example of him by giving him a heavy sentence,"" Hamed Derakhshan told CNN. The Derakhshan family will appeal Hossein Derakhshan's sentence. Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, condemned the sentence. ""This is the longest sentence issued against a blogger in Iran, and it is solely because of his opinions and blogging. The sentence is meant to send a chilling message to the Iranian youth to stay away from the internet in practicing their freedom of expression,"" Ghaemi said. Derakhshan's blog, titled Editor Myself on i.hoder.com, gained worldwide notoriety. He got particular attention for helping other Iranians start their own blogs with step-by-step start-up guides published in Persian. Derakhshan also blogged on many political issues including freedom of expression, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Israeli relations in the Middle East. In 2006 Derakhshan shocked his followers when he visited Israel on his Canadian passport. ""He was reporting his trip minute by minute on his blog ... in both English and Persian. It was the first time that an Iranian was reporting the real life in Israel,"" Hamed Derakhshan said. Shortly before his imprisonment Hossein Derakhshan began writing in support of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ""He felt Ahmadinejad was doing good for Iran. At that point many Iranian bloggers didn't like his ideas. He believed in the system. He did not believe it was perfect, but he thought he could work with the system and make it better,"" Hamed Derakhshan said. CNN attempts to contact Iranian authorities for comment were unsuccessful.","Hossein Derakhshan is 35-year-old Canadian-Iranian blogger .

"(CNN) -- China's young golfers mixed the rough with the smooth on an historic day at the China Open on Thursday. Ye Wocheng underlined China's prodigious golfing talent as he teed off to become the youngest player in the history of the European Tour at the age of 12 years and 242 days. It was also a day to remember for another of China's young talent pool as 16-year-old Dou Zecheng signed for an impressive two-under-par 70 in Tianjin. ""I was bit nervous at the start, had a bogey on the third but then came back really well with four birdies,"" said Dou, who was joint 11th after the first day's play in a group including compatriot Bin Yan. ""This is obviously by far the biggest event I have ever entered, so I am very excited to be part of it. ""This is a very long, tough course for me. On a couple of the longer par fours, I need to hit my wood from the fairway to have any chance of reaching the greens. ""I hit a bit of a top off the first tee and only carried it 230 yards, but it was okay because I still got a par."" Ye also made a solid start on the back nine at the Binhai Lake Golf Club, holing a birdie at the par-four 14th to cancel out his dropped shot on the 13th to card a creditable 38 at the turn. But the schoolboy from the southern manufacturing hub of Dongguan lost momentum over the front nine, dropping five bogeys for a final seven-over-par score of 79. Ye, who balances his homework with his golfing career, now faces a battle to survive the halfway cut at the $3.2 million tournament. ""It's the first time I've played with a baby!"" said his 35-year-old Spanish playing partner Jose Manual Lara. ""I think I was playing on the computer at 12, not playing in a big tournament on the European Tour. ""He's definitely got something about him. He knows how to manage himself out on the course, and I'm sure he's going to go a long way in the game. ""He hits it a long way for his age and he's got a very good short game. I was impressed with him."" The 15-year-old Bai Zhengkai, who earned his place in the field after winning the China Junior Match Play Championship, finished the day on 11 over. They are following in the footsteps of Guan Tianlang, who drew global focus on China's young talent with his sensational Masters debut last month. The 14-year-old made the halfway cut as the youngest player to enter the prestigious major and finished as Augusta's leading amateur. Tianlang was invited to play at the PGA Tour event in New Orleans last week, where he also made the cut but then finished 71st -- bottom of the players who made it to the weekend rounds. Back at the China Open, Dutchman Robert-Jan Derksen held the first-round lead after a late birdie run took the 39-year-old to a six-under 66. Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat, Frenchman Raphael Jacquelin and Australian Brett Rumford were tied for second two shots further back. Former British Open champion Paul Lawrie was still in the hunt on 69 but Europe's new Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley finished four over for the day. Woods ruling . Meanwhile, golf's governing bodies have backed the decision by officials at the Masters not to disqualify Tiger Woods from last month's tournament even though the world No. 1 was found guilty of infringing the rules. Augusta's rules committee deemed Woods had violated one of golf's ball-drop rules during the second round and handed him a two-stroke penalty. But there had been calls for Woods to be disqualified from the tournament after he incorrectly signed for a round of 71. The 14-time major winner hit a shot on the 15th hole that ricocheted off the flagstick and bounced into a pond. Woods took a drop but later conceded he had not taken the drop at the same place as the original spot -- an infringement that warrants a two-shot penalty. At the time, officials determined Woods hadn't broken any rules and so did not disqualify Woods for signing an improper scorecard because it made its ""initial determination prior to the finish of the player's round."" It was only under further scrutiny from the television coverage -- prompted by an inquiry from a viewer -- that Woods was retrospectively punished, but was not penalized for the incorrectly signed scorecard. The R&A and the U.S. Golf Association supported the decision made at Augusta -- but stressed it should not set a precedent for future incidents. The joint statement explained: ""In returning his score card, Woods had breached Rule 6-6d by returning a score (6) for the 15th hole that was lower than his actual score (8). ""The penalty for such a breach of Rule 6-6d is disqualification. Under Rule 33-7, a committee has discretion to waive that penalty in 'exceptional individual cases.' The Committee elected to invoke that discretion and waived Woods' penalty of disqualification. ""The Decisions on the Rules of Golf authorize a committee to correct an incorrect decision before the competition has closed, and they establish that where a Committee incorrectly advises a competitor, before he returns his scorecard, that he has incurred no penalty, and then subsequently corrects its mistake, it is appropriate for the committee to waive the disqualification penalty. ""The Woods ruling was based on exceptional facts and should not be viewed as a general precedent for relaxing or ignoring a competitor's essential obligation under the Rules to return a correct score card.""","Ye Wocheng becomes youngest European Tour player in history at the China Open .

"(CNN) -- Hours after a plane slammed into her home Karen Wielinski gave an exclusive interview to Buffalo radio station WBEN. This is her account based on that interview. Husband and wife Doug and Karen and daughter Jill were in their house when the plane crashed. Karen Wielinski was watching TV in her home when she heard a plane making an unusually loud noise. ""I thought to myself, if that's a plane, it's going to hit something,"" she said. Then, Continental Airlines Flight 3407 crashed into the Clarence Center, New York, home, trapping her and her family. ""And next thing I knew the ceiling was on me,"" she said. Just before the crash, Wielinski was sitting in the family room watching TV, her 22-year-old daughter Jill was watching TV in the front of the home and her husband Doug had just left the family room to work in the dining room, she said. The Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, a 74-seat turboprop, was en route from Newark, New Jersey, to Buffalo Niagara International Airport when it went down around 10:20 p.m. ET Thursday.  Watch a witness describe what she heard » . All 49 people aboard the plane -- 44 passengers, four crew members and an off-duty pilot -- were killed. Karen and Jill Wielinski escaped and were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, but Doug Wielinski was killed. Read more about the victims . At first, Karen Wielinski said, she thought the crash wasn't real. ""When the ceiling first fell down ... I think the first thing I said to myself was 'Is this real? Is this reality or am I dreaming something?' WBEN: Listen to audio of Wielinski's interview . But then it became all too real. ""I just didn't think I was going to get out of there,"" she said. ""I thought 'This is it,' and kind of panic set in,"" she said. ""I just, I didn't know how much was on top of me, so I was panicking a little but trying to stay cool."" That's when Wielinski noticed a glimmer of light to her right. ""I don't know if you gain strength when you have to but whatever was on top of me I just pushed off, at least part of it so that I could get out of that hole,"" she said. ""I shouted first in case anybody was out there,"" she said. ""And then kind of pushed what was on me, part of that off and crawled out the hole."" When she got out of the hole she heard a woman crying and saw the back of her home was destroyed. ""The fire had started,"" she said. ""I could see the wing of the plane."" After surveying the disaster she saw her daughter was safe, but hysterically crying. ""From what she's saying it appeared the attic kind of came down onto where she was,"" Wielinski said. ""She couldn't get through the windows because of the fire that was there, but she miraculously found an opening and slid out of that."" Immediately after the mother and daughter escaped, Wielinski said her daughter asked where her father was. ""And I didn't know,"" Wielinski said. ""I just told her we had to get out of there, we had to get away from the fire, because when I knew it was a plane, I knew that there might be explosions or something."" So both women ran to the back of the yard and up the street to look for their neighbors. When she was asked early on if she had heard news about her husband, Wielinski said no, and she didn't know whom to ask. ""But to me it looked like the plane just came down on the middle of the house, and unfortunately that's where Doug was,"" she said. The women were taken to the hospital with only minor injuries. Wielinski said her arm was in a sling because she fractured her collarbone. She said her daughter escaped with only scratches on her feet. Wielinski grew emotional talking about her husband.

"(CNN) -- The death certificate for Boston bombings suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died April 19 after a shootout with police, says he died of ""gunshot wounds of torso and extremities"" and ""blunt trauma to head and torso,"" according to the owner of the funeral parlor that currently holds Tsarnaev's body. Peter Stefan, owner of Graham Putnam & Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester, Massachusetts, read the death certificate to CNN over the phone Friday evening. He said it has yet to be filed with the city of Boston. There is no gravesite chosen yet for the 26-year-old Tsarnaev, Stefan said. He said that if he can't find a cemetery plot, he plans to ask the government to find a grave. ""Everyone deserves to be buried,"" Stefan said. Tsarnaev's uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, claimed his nephew's body, according to family spokeswoman Heda Saratova. The family plans an independent autopsy before burying the body somewhere in Massachusetts, she said. Stefan acknowledged plans for a second autopsy. Authorities say Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar, carried out the April 15 bombings at the Boston Marathon. The attacks killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. The brothers later killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer, authorities say. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is being held at a federal Bureau of Prisons medical facility in Devens, Massachusetts, charged with using a weapon of mass destruction, a charge that carries the death penalty. He is being treated for gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs and hands that he received in the April 19 shootout with police that led to his brother's death. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was shot in the gunbattle, and Dzhokhar apparently ran over his brother as he tried to flee in a car, authorities have said. It is not known whether the ""blunt trauma"" listed on Tamerlan Tsarnaev's death certificate relates to injuries from the car. As part of their continuing investigation, investigators have found explosives residue in the apartment that the elder Tsarnaev shared with his wife and young daughter, a source briefed on the investigation said Friday. The residue turned up in at least three places at the apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the source said: the kitchen table, the kitchen sink and the bathtub. U.S. law enforcement officials briefed on the progress of the investigation have provided CNN with other critical details: . -- Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators that he and his brother built the devices in Tamerlan's home; . -- He said the brothers originally planned a suicide attack on the city's massive Independence Day celebration, which draws about 500,000 people and is televised nationally on CBS; . -- Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators that the brothers chose to target the Boston Marathon only a day or two before the event. They changed their plans because their bombs were ready sooner than they expected. The officials spoke on background because they were not authorized to speak with the media. Katherine Russell, Tsarnaev's widow, has remained largely out of view since her husband's death, staying inside her parents' Rhode Island home. Her attorney, Amato DeLuca, says the 24-year-old knew nothing about plans to bomb the race, and reports of her husband's involvement came as an ""absolute shock"" to Russell and her family. Three of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's friends have been charged in connection with the case. Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev were charged Wednesday with conspiring to discard potentially incriminating items from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room. Robel Phillipos was charged with making false statements to investigators. The FBI is examining Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's laptop, two federal law enforcement officials told CNN. Authorities have said they believe the brothers acted alone but are investigating whether they could have learned from or been aided by terror groups, including groups overseas.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Gunmen in Pakistan killed a leading prosecutor working on high-profile terrorism cases and an anti-Taliban politician and his son, the latest violence ahead of next week's national elections. Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali was heading to a court in Rawalpindi, where he was trying a case stemming from the death of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated while she was campaigning for her party. Ali's attackers opened fire on his car as it passed through an Islamabad neighborhood, police said. He was rushed to a hospital but died before arrival, said hospital spokesman Dr. Wasim Khawaja. The ambush also wounded his bodyguard, whom authorities assigned to protect him after he received threats from the Pakistani Taliban, according to police spokesman Javed Hussain. The unidentified gunmen fled and are still at large, police officials said. In Karachi, gunmen on a motorbike shot and killed Sadiq Zaman Khattak and his 4-year-old son when they were leaving a mosque, said Zahid Khan of Awami National Party, an anti-Taliban liberal party. Khattak, representing the Awami National Party, had been a candidate for a seat in the National Assembly. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, and Khan blamed the ""interim government"" and election officials. The Taliban have threatened the Awami National Party and another liberal party, the Muttahida Quami Movement. The group has claimed responsibility for some deadly attacks against those party members. In a statement, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the attack on Ali and called for an investigation to ""expose the real culprits involved in the murder."" Bhutto had returned from a self-imposed, eight-year exile to campaign for the Pakistan People's Party in the country's general elections in 2007. She escaped one attempt on her life but was killed on December 27, 2007, by a 15-year-old suicide bomber while campaigning in Rawalpindi, the seat of Pakistan's military. Bhutto twice was prime minister and was the country's first woman to hold the office. Ali had linked the assassin's alleged facilitators, whom he was prosecuting, to the Pakistani Taliban, an allegation the court has yet to confirm. The Pakistani Taliban, who are closely linked with their namesake in Afghanistan and with al Qaeda, operate in the ungoverned area that sits on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Police officials have also been arrested in the investigation, which has lasted nearly six years. Ali was also involved in the case of the terror attacks that struck Mumbai, India, in November 2008. Ten heavily armed men, some from Pakistan, attacked landmarks there, including high-end hotels, the historic Victoria Terminus train station and the Jewish cultural center Chabad House. They killed more than 160 people in three days. Musharraf's party calls for election boycott . The All Pakistan Muslim League -- the party of former President Pervez Musharraf -- is calling for a boycott of the country's May 11 parliamentary elections, the league said Friday. The party's Central Executive Committee unanimously determined that Musharraf is being ""victimized."" And that's a ""clear indication that the upcoming elections in Pakistan will not be free and fair,"" Musharraf spokesman Raza Bokhari said. The league said that ""the stage is being set to enable pro-Taliban politicians in stealing the elections"" and ""urged the people of Pakistan, especially the Youth of Pakistan, to see through this farce, stand up to Save Pakistan and join the APML in this boycott."" Musharraf resigned as president of Pakistan in 2008 after nine years in power and went into exile the following year, living in London and Dubai. He came back to Pakistan recently under heavy security but intending to return to political life. However, he has faced stiff barriers. After his return, Musharraf was placed under house arrest by an anti-terrorism court over allegations he illegally ordered the detention of judges in 2007. He denies the charges against him. The ex-military strongman still has to face two other cases dating from his time in power. The first relates to claims he did not do enough to protect Bhutto's life weeks before an election in which she hoped to return to office. Musharraf is also accused of ordering his troops to kill Nawab Akbar Bugti, a popular tribal leader, in the volatile province of Balochistan, in 2006. Just recently, the high court in Peshawar banned Musharraf from politics for life, a move he can appeal.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A pressurized cylinder exploded at Universal Studios on Sunday, injuring two firefighters as they tried to fight a blaze that began earlier in the day, Los Angeles authorities said. The fire destroyed buildings and movie sets at Universal Studios on Sunday. Eight other firefighters were injured in the fire, which was expected to be contained by 4:15 p.m. (7:15 p.m. ET), said Ron Haralson, an inspector with the Los Angeles County Fire Department. The explosion occurred about 2:30 p.m. (5:30 p.m. ET) near the video vault of the Universal Studios back lot. The vault was damaged. The fast-moving, early morning blaze destroyed several movie sets and the King Kong exhibit. Even so, officials still planned to go ahead with the 2008 MTV Movie Awards show at the site -- just north of downtown Los Angeles, adjacent to the Universal Studios theme park. ""The areas we are utilizing for our production were unaffected and the 2008 MTV Movie Awards will go on as planned. We're working closely with authorities to make sure everything operates smoothly,"" an MTV spokesman said in a statement. The awards show will bring a parade of A-list stars to the park's CityWalk area. According to MTV's Web site, celebrities such as Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Sarah Jessica Parker, Justin Timberlake and Robert Downey Jr. likely will attend. Universal Studios officials planned to resume normal business hours Monday, including the studio tour. The fire destroyed an area called New York street, which includes movie set-style buildings designed to look like the cityscape of New York City. Hours after the blaze was reported, the roughly two-block area appeared charred and resembled a ""disaster movie,"" said Los Angeles Councilman Tom LaBonge. LaBonge said he could see the smoke from his Silver Lake home Sunday morning. ""It looked like a bomb had exploded,"" he said.  Watch choppers try to douse the fire » . The blaze began around 4:45 a.m. (7:45 a.m. ET) and was contained initially by 9 a.m. Throughout the morning, large plumes of black smoke rose as the fire burned the vault containing hundreds of videos, said Ron Meyer, chief operating officer of Universal Studios. ""Fortunately, nothing irreplaceable was lost,"" Meyer said. ""The video library was affected and damaged, but our main vault of our motion picture negatives was not."" The set of ""The Changeling,"" a film recently directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Angelina Jolie, was ""completely destroyed,"" Meyer said. Another area called ""Courthouse Square"" also was destroyed, Meyer said. Numerous movies have been shot in that area, including several scenes of the 1985 hit ""Back to the Future,"" Meyer said. And two of the eight locations used by the CBS series ""Ghost Whisperer"" were affected, he said. Fire inspectors had not determined what caused the blaze, said Los Angles County Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman. There were no reports of filming at the time of the fire.","NEW: Three firefighters suffer minor injuries battling blaze, official says .

"(CNN) -- Built like a wrestler, when Grigor Dimitrov says ""don't call me baby,"" you'd be advised to listen. The 21-year-old has had enough with the tennis world labeling him as ""Baby Federer"" following comparisons with 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer. After winning the U.S. and Wimbledon junior titles in 2008, his coach Peter Lundgren at the time hailed Dimitrov as the next Federer -- a man who the former Swedish player had worked with previously. It was supposed to be a compliment -- a warning to the rest of the world that Bulgaria had unearthed a tennis player ready to emulate one of the greatest to have ever picked up a racket. But Lundgren's comment has weighed heavily on Dimitrov's shoulders ever since with the watching world awaiting his rise to stardom. It was Lundgren who oversaw Federer's first 10 ATP World Tour titles and his first grand slam title win at Wimbledon at 2003. And while Dimitrov would love to follow in the Swiss star's footsteps, he wants to make it clear that he is his own man -- not Federer mark two. ""You know, all the comparisons, I think that I definitely want people to stop with that,"" he told CNN's Open Court show. ""Of course we have some similarities here and there. I'm flattered with that and actually, I thought it was really cool at the beginning. ""But with time, I've realized what I am. It's something that is definitely not what the other person is, so I'm trying to build up my own style and when I'm on court, I do my own shots. ""I think that's eventually what everyone will see."" Dimitrov has been plotting his rise to the top since the very first time he stepped onto a court as a child with his father Dimitar, a tennis coach in their native city of Haskovo. His single-handed backhand, which is so unusual among players of his age group, was honed under his father's gaze. ""I actually never thought of any other sport,"" said Dimitrov, recalling his formative years. ""My father was a tennis coach and my mum was a former volleyball player, so I was in the sport area in general. ""But the only thing I was always telling my parents was: 'I just want to play tennis.' ""Obviously, my dad showed me a few shots. I was six or seven and I was just playing regularly."" Such was Dimitrov's talent during his teenage years that he was soon off to France to train at the prestigious Patrick Mouratoglou Academy just outside of Paris. It was there that he began to show glimpses of his future potential, winning a whole host of junior tournaments on his way to becoming the third youngest player to break into the world's top 100 in 2011. But it was his decision to leave France to join up with the ""Good to Great Academy"" in Sweden last November which has helped propel his career to the next level. Working alongside ex-world No. 2 Magnus Norman and the former doubles partnership of Nicklas Kulti and Mikael Tillstrom, Dimitrov reached the Brisbane International final before losing to Briton Andy Murray in January. ""All the guys from Good to Great Academy are amazing and all of them have incredible experiences from the tour,"" Dimitrov said. ""They all have something to bring to the table so that makes it a lot more interesting. ""You take a little from this one, pick a little from that one, and then the next thing you know, you're getting sort of completed and, that helps you during the weeks."" While Dimitrov has yet to propel himself into the top 10 -- he has reached a career-high 28th this year -- he has begun to show signs of improvement, most noticeably during last month's Monte Carlo Masters. The young pretender gave Rafael Nadal one of the toughest tests on clay that the seven-time French Open champion has endured in recent years. A full-blooded display against the undisputed king of the surface was eventually curtailed by defeat in three sets, but the fruits of his labor were bared for all to see. ""I had kind of rough matches in the past weeks so it gave me of course a lot of confidence, even though I lost them,"" Dimitrov said. ""I felt quite good about myself and the way I was progressing and of course, these hours in the gym. ""They're just a must. You just kind of do it and it doesn't matter if it's Sunday or Saturday, you've just got to do what you've got to do. ""I mean basically, you've got to make it."" Away from the court, and when he's not working out, Dimitrov has plenty of other interests to keep him busy. While he remains coy on his private life, having been linked romantically to women's tennis stars Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams in the past, he is more than happy to divulge his other extracurricular activities. ""I enjoy good food,"" he said. ""That's one of the things. I love good restaurants and I love cars and all these things. ""We're away for 25 weeks a year so you appreciate the time when you're off. ""If you can get it with friends and family and you know, people around that you thought you hadn't seen for a while, it's always good. ""Of course if you get the chance to go somewhere to get a few days away here and there, I mean I'd definitely get that.""","Young tennis star Grigor Dimitrov wants to shed his ""Baby Federer"" tag .

"(CNN) -- The idea of an amputee tinkling on piano keys with all the flair and grace of an able-handed person may seem like a futuristic fantasy. But watch Johnny Matheney effortlessly arch and extend each finger on his bionic arm and you can't help but agree with him when he says: ""The future is coming now."" Its makers describe Matheney's robotic limb as the most sophisticated of its kind in the world, recreating virtually every movement of a natural arm -- and all controlled by brain power. ""When they took my arm I never thought I would have an actual hand -- I saw the hooks and thought that was exactly what I would be getting,"" said Matheney, who lost his left arm to cancer in 2008. ""So once they introduced me to this, it was like something out of space come to Earth."" Explore the bionic body . Moving on up . Featuring 100 sensors, 26 joints, 17 motors and a tiny computer built into the palm of the robotic hand, the revolutionary Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) is the work of researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. Weighing four kilograms -- much like a normal arm -- it can mimic almost all the same movements. ""This is the most sophisticated arm in the world,"" said Michael McLoughlin, of the university's Applied Physics Laboratory. ""What we have done is, by order of magnitude, increase the ability to do very highly dexterous kinds of motions. So you can think about things like eventually playing the piano ... I think we'll get there someday."" The MPL is programmed to respond to electrical impulses in Matheney's residual limb -- he simply has to think about moving his old arm. ""You don't even really think about it,"" said Matheney. ""You're extending the arm, talking and doing other things -- it just automatically does it."" Nerve Center . For former baker Matheney, the first step in the ground-breaking project was bringing to life the dead nerves at the end of his residual arm. Matheney underwent targeted muscle reinnervation -- surgery that involves rewiring electrical signals in the stump. Only 50 people in the world have had the operation, which takes a couple of hours. ""We take all the electrical signals that are going down to the missing limb and reroute them into residual muscles that are still there,"" said Albert Chi, assistant professor of surgery, trauma and surgical critical care at the university. ""Now when Johnny has a natural thought about moving that missing limb, he contracts that muscle and we are able to capture those signals and translate them into messages for the prosthetic limb."" Within two weeks of surgery, Matheney began to feel his phantom limb for the first time in years. He practiced moving it for 20 minutes each day, training the nerves for his new bionic arm. ""The more you do it, the more the pathway is cleaned up and the cobwebs are out of it,"" he said. ""After the surgery I was constantly rubbing my stump to see what new feeling was coming in. I said 'Wow I can feel my pinky finger.' I kept on doing it, and it was like 'Oh right, I've got a pointer.'"" Symphony of movement . The ambitious bionic limb, seven years in the making, is incredibly lifelike in its movements, thanks to a complex symphony of muscle triggers. Other robotic arms have relied on direct signals, whereas the MPL picks up a chorus of muscle motions -- creating a more fluid movement. ""We are using a lot more electrode sites,"" explained biomedical engineer Courtney Moran. ""That array of muscle contraction is more like a chord in music, so you are able to get more complexity of motion -- like you would get more complexity of sound."" Looking good . While many prosthetic limbs look lifelike, finding one that also moves naturally has proved more of a challenge. There are now plans to cover the MPL in a skin-like substance, which could make it the most inconspicuous artificial arm in history. ""There is an elegance to it, and that is actually one of the most important things for the users of prosthetics,"" said McLoughlin. ""The natural movement is almost more important than the appearance."" Indeed for Matheney, the bionic arm feels just as natural as the arm he lost -- to the point where ""every time I have to turn it back in, it's like losing part of me all over again."" ""I do a lot of handy work around the house, a lot of cooking,"" he says. ""And to be able to hold bowls and grab spoons is absolutely amazing.""","'World's most sophisticated' bionic arm is controlled by the mind .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League champions Manchester United posted record third-quarter revenue of £91.7 million [$142 million] on the back of new sponsorship deals in Asia and Europe. The club, who have just claimed their 20th Premier League title, reported a 52.2% increase in sponsorship revenue having announced new deals with two financial services providers in Denmark and Vietnam as well as an agreement with a Japanese social gaming company. As one of the world's most popular and successful sport teams, United has a total of 36 corporate sponsors despite gross debt standing at £367.6 million. Financial football expert Andy Green tweeted: ""In next few years #MUFC will generate over £200m in surplus cash. What will it be used for?"" Last month, the club signed an eight year deal with U.S. insurance giant Aon, to brand the club's training kit and attach its name to the Carrington training ground. Read more: Manchester United pen new multi-million dollar Aon deal . It is the first time the English Premier League giants have sold the branding rights to their coveted training ground on the outskirts of Manchester and represents another step in the club's strategy to increase revenues. The drive for sponsorship revenue comes at a time when United is seeking to bring in new players for the 2013/14 season in September, as the team prepares to defend its domestic title and attempt to win the European Cup for fourth time. Earlier this week, manager Alex Ferguson promised the club would be ""competitive"" in the summer transfer market as they hope to rival other title contenders such as Manchester City and Chelsea. Speaking to Inside United, the club's official magazine, Ferguson said: ""Hopefully the players we bring into the club in the next year or so will be of the quality we need."" United have reportedly been linked with moves for Borussia Dortmund's Polish striker Robert Lewandowski and Atletico Madrid's prolific forward Radamel Falcao. Although United coasted to the Premier League title, Ferguson's side was knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid in the quarterfinals. The Old Trafford club is owned by the American Glazer family, who oversaw the club's listing on the New York Stock Exchange last August. For the 2011/2012 season, United increased revenues by £14.2 million to £117.6 million, the highest of any club in the Premier League.","United, who have just claimed their 20th Premier League title, reported a 52.2% increase in sponsorship revenue .

"(CNN) -- Though her mother has suddenly reappeared after 11 years, don't expect a family reunion any time soon, Morgan Heist says. ""I don't think she deserves to see me,"" the 20-year-old told CNN's Piers Morgan on Thursday night. ""I don't really have any plans on going to see her."" Anger is one of the many emotions Morgan Heist has gone through since she learned last week that Brenda Heist, the mother she last saw when she was 8, had mysteriously reappeared. Brenda Heist disappeared from her Pennsylvania family some 11 years ago, leaving her husband,daughter and son wondering if something terrible had happened to her. Police searched for her for years, even at one point creating a cold case task force. Then last week Brenda Heist, 54, turned herself in to authorities in Key Largo, Florida, saying she had just walked away from her family because of stress. The fact that her mother abandoned her and never even called has left her seething, Morgan Heist said. The anger is captured in a post on the daughter's Twitter page that reads she hopes her mother ""rots in hell."" ""That makes me really mad,"" Morgan Heist said. ""I can't believe she would do that because she was a good mom. She was great. But, I mean, I guess something happened. Something snapped in her. "" Her father, Lee Heist, said he is not planning on visiting his former wife anytime soon . ""I don't see where it would do any good for either of us to see her again,"" Lee Heist said. Left on a whim . Brenda Heist disappeared February 2002 after last being seen dropping off her children at school. She was going through a divorce from Lee Heist and was applying for housing assistance so that she could get an apartment. She worked as a bookkeeper for a car dealer and hoped to receive some financial aid. However, her request was denied, police said. ""She was very upset, she was sitting in a park crying, thinking about how she would raise her children, feeling sorry for herself,"" said Sgt. John Schofield, a Lititz Borough, Pennsylvania, police detective. Schofield was one of the many officers who searched for Heist. It wasn't long before she was approached by two males and a female who asked her what was wrong. After she told them what had happened, they invited her to hitchhike with them down to Florida. ""At a whim, she decided at that very moment, she would go along with them,"" Schofield said. Schofield spoke to Heist at length after she turned herself in. ""She was very emotional; she hung her head; she's ashamed. She was crying when I met with her. She knows what she did was completely wrong, but all that while, she'd never made one effort to call or contact her family at all,"" Schofield said. Years homeless while husband under suspicion . She spent the first two years homeless, living under bridges, eating food thrown out by restaurants after they closed. For the next seven years, she lived in a camper with a man she had met. They made money as day laborers, cleaning boats and doing other odd jobs for which they didn't have to show ID and were paid in cash. After that relationship soured, Schofield said, she lived on the street again for another two years. Lee Heist even became a suspect though he was eventually cleared. Some believed he was involved in Brenda Heist's disappearance, he said. ""The hardest thing I had to deal with was, the families of some of my children's friends would not let them play with them, because of what they thought of me. That just tore me apart. I hope they've learned a lesson not to prejudge,"" he said. In 2010, Lee Heist filed a petition with the county court to have Brenda declared legally deceased, according to a Lititz police news release. It was a measure necessary for closure, he said. Lee Heist later remarried and said he will learn to forgive his former wife. But for Morgan Heist, forgiving her mom may not be easy. ""I hope to eventually forgive her one day for myself, not for her,"" Morgan Heist said. CNN's Laura Ly contributed to this report. Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- There's some work to be done to get United States airports on par with their global competitors. This is according to President Obama, who highlighted poor U.S. airport rankings during a press conference Tuesday. ""Just one interesting statistic when it comes to airports.

"(CNN) -- London City Airport wants to eradicate the many nuisances associated with flying. Should they succeed, missing luggage, delayed flights and long security lines will be irritations of another era. Even wading through a sea of taxi drivers to find the cardboard placard that bears your name will be a thing of the past. This streamlined experience is being delivered with the help of a technology known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Essentially, it is an overarching platform that allows a variety of devices or machines to communicate with each other. This ""machine to machine"" communication (M2M) remains in its early stages, but its application is being tested in a number of areas. It is the foundation for ""smart cars"", vehicles which are tuned in to avoid collision, and ""smart lights"", which detect when you've woken up and then turn on. London City Airport is the first airport in the world to test it in the field of commercial aviation. Technology company Living PlanIt and retail developer Milligan will lead the project backed by the UK's Technology Strategy Board. Over the next year, the airport will integrate different technologies to provide a taster of what's possible. Just what is the Internet of Things? Our interactive explains all . Many of the more advanced features involve tracking passengers through a mix of face recognition and crowd-sourcing software that already exists in airports, plus the GPS that is already available in smart devices. For instance, a traveler who pre-orders food online or though their smartphone will be able to have it delivered to them as they arrive at the departure lounge. ""When someone arrives, sensors will detect that person's frame, and will notify the F&B outlet to get everything ready,"" explains Robin Daniels, Living PlanIt's executive vice president of sales and marketing. Similar technology can insure that a passenger who booked a taxi in advance can exit the airport and step immediately into a waiting car. ""There's no reason you can't have an app on your phone tell you the route and the correct exit (to find your vehicle),"" says Daniels. Other features will simply be about streamlining what's already there. For instance, though luggage can be monitored to a degree, there's no system in place to track it in real-time. What this means is that passengers and their luggage can be tracked at the same time. If a flyer checks his back but misses his plane, his luggage won't be boarded.

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Reggae legend Lucky Dube, one of South Africa's most famous musicians, was killed in an attempted car-jacking as he dropped his children off at a relative's house, his record label said Friday. Reggae star Lucky Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans. Dube, 43, was killed in Johannesburg around 8 p.m. local time Thursday after someone tried to steal his car, Gallo Record Company said in a statement. Police said he was shot. The statement said Dube attempted to escape but died almost instantly from his wounds. Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans, and his death cast a shadow over festivities ahead of South Africa's highly-anticipated appearance in the rugby World Cup final with England this weekend. News of his death was the headline in many Friday newspapers, knocking the World Cup off the front pages for the first time in days. Callers to talk radio stations suggested the Springboks wear black armbands in remembrance of Dube when they take to the field Saturday in Paris. Gallo Records called the death ""senseless and random,"" and it was not clear whether Dube's attackers knew who he was. South Africa is one of the most dangerous societies in the world. Figures from the South African Police Service show that from April 2006 to March 2007, more than 19,000 South Africans were murdered, more than 52,600 people were raped, and nearly 13,600 people were carjacked. ""It's very sad,"" said Mark Sutherland, London bureau chief for Billboard Magazine. ""He's a big loss to the South African music business. (He was) one of their most successful artists and certainly one of their leading reggae artists."" Sutherland said Dube was an extremely respected musician who toured extensively around the world. Dube had just returned from a tour of the United States that stretched from California to New York. His record company said Dube leaves ""a great void"" in the music industry after a 25-year career. Dube recorded 22 albums in Zulu, English and Afrikaans. Born outside Johannesburg in 1964, Dube was named ""Lucky"" by his mother because he was the first child to be born after several failed pregnancies. Dube started singing in 1982, joining a band playing Mbaqanga, or traditional Zulu music. It was only later that he began recording reggae tracks as a solo singer, but the genre was to dominate and define the remainder of his career. Ivor Haarburger, the chief exectutive of Gallo Music Group, said he was deeply saddened by the loss. ""Lucky was not just an extraordinary artist, he was a personal friend,"" Haarburger said. ""It's so sad to lose such a great friend and so tragically."" Dube is survived by his wife, Zanele, and his seven children: Bongi, Nonkululeko, Thokozani, Laura, Siyanda, Philani and three-month old Melokuhle. E-mail to a friend .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Officials wielding infrared thermometers are becoming more difficult to avoid at entry points from mainland China as Hong Kong strengthens its defenses against the H7N9 strain of bird flu. Extra measures are being taken this week during an expected surge in visitors across the border for the three-day Labor Day break from Monday to Wednesday. Up to 600 officials will be stationed at border crossings during the holiday, including more than 100 volunteers in addition to government staff, according to Hong Kong's food and health secretary, Ko Wing-man. ""There will also be promotion and education work done at the borders reminding visitors to stay home or visit a doctor if they are not feeling well,"" he added, in response to reporters' questions on Sunday. Along with extra screening at entry points, tour operators are also being asked to keep an eye on travelers who may be showing symptoms of what the World Health Organization calls ""one of the most lethal influenza viruses"" it has ever seen. As of Sunday, the number of bird flu infections had risen to 124, based on provincial Ministry of Health websites. The figure includes one case in Taiwan, which remains the only recorded infection beyond mainland China. Within the country, the infection has spread to eight provinces and the city of Shanghai, as well as the capital Beijing. Twenty-three people have so far died from the infection. According to the last figures released from the national Ministry of Health on April 24, 14 people have recovered after treatment. On that day, the ministry switched to weekly updates and the figure hasn't been updated since. Health authorities are still investigating the possible sources of infection and how the virus is spread. As recently as Thursday, the WHO repeated that so far there had been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Taiwanese health officials say the territory's first case was imported by a local businessman who regularly traveled between back and forth between China's Jiangsu province and Taiwan. To date, 27 cases have been reported in Jiangsu, resulting in four deaths. That's only the second highest number of provincial cases behind Zhejiang, which has reported 46 cases of infection and six deaths. Wearing a customary white lab coat during a tour of the China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday, Premier Li Keqiang urged officials to be vigilant against bird flu. ""We cannot afford to take it easy or relax, as we are facing a new virus. We should be prepared for any possible development,"" he said in quotes carried by state-run news agency Xinhua. On Saturday, a mass cull was ordered at a major wholesale poultry market in the city of Dongguan after random testing detected the presence of an H7 strain of bird flu. No birds were showing symptoms, according to a statement from the city's Bureau of Agriculture. Nor had been there been any cases of human infection, it added. Dongguan is a city in the central province on Guangdong. Hong Kong has said it is prepared to halt the import of live poultry, meat and eggs if the H7N9 virus is found at a mainland poultry farm with export ties to Hong Kong, or if that farm is within 13 kilometers of another that supplies the city.

"Savar, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Preliminary results of a government inquiry into last week's collapse of a nine-story building on the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital have found that ""heavy machinery and high-capacity generators"" were ""largely responsible,"" according to state media. ""During the inquiry, we have found that use of substandard materials during the construction also contributed to the building collapse,"" committee head Main Uddin Khandaker told Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha. He predicted the committee would complete its report within a few days. The preliminary conclusion came as police arrested engineer Abdur Razzak Khan on a charge of negligence, Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha reported. ""He warned that the building was unsafe ahead of its collapse, but he worked as the construction consultant when the Rana Plaza's owner illegally added three floors"" to the building, the agency said, citing a police official whom it did not identify by name. Two other engineers -- who worked for the municipality of Savar -- have been arrested for having allegedly issued a safety clearance despite the appearance of cracks in the building that appeared the day before it collapsed, the news agency said. The building owner, Sohel Rana, was arrested last weekend as he attempted to flee to India; owners and senior management of the factories have been arrested for forcing workers to resume production in the building shortly before it collapsed, it said. The death toll from the country's deadliest industrial disaster rose Saturday to 547 as another 22 bodies were recovered, the agency said. Authorities say more than 2,400 people have been rescued from the wreckage since the building collapsed more than a week ago in this suburb of Dhaka, the capital. The number of dead has risen as workers have begun using heavy machinery to cull through the slabs of concrete, around which hundreds of people awaited news of the missing. The collapse of the building that held five garment factories and thousands of workers has provoked widespread protests in Bangladesh, including attacks on some textile facilities. The demonstrators have expressed anger over the conditions in which many are forced to work. But the trade group that represents the garment industry said Thursday it was safe for the millions of textile workers in and around Dhaka to return to duty. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged residents Friday to delay protests planned for this weekend in the capital so that government workers can focus on recovery efforts. She told reporters she wanted the opposition alliance and Muslim hard-liners marching under the banner of Hefazat-e-Islam ""to consider postponement, not withdrawal of their programs, at this critical point when the people are still fighting for life and rescue operations are under way."" Bangladesh's $20 billion garment industry accounts for 77% of the country's exports. Among those caught up in the finger pointing after the disaster are Western retailers and clothing brands that Bangladeshi suppliers say put heavy pressure on prices, resulting in bad pay and conditions for workers. Bangladesh vs. the U.S.: How much does it cost to make a denim shirt? The Bangladeshi government has come under criticism from representatives of labor groups who say it has failed to tighten lax safety standards despite a series of recent fatal disasters in the country's garment industry. In an interview Thursday with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Hasina acknowledged that the industry is beset with problems, but said her government is moving rapidly to fix them. Journalist Farid Ahmed reported from Savar, and CNN's Tom Watkins reported and wrote from Atlanta.","NEW: The death toll rises to 547 as more bodies are discovered .

"(CNN) -- For workers of Bangladesh, the worst kind of tragedy imaginable struck last week when the Rana Plaza garment factory building -- just outside my home city of Dhaka -- collapsed, killing more than 500 workers. Despite the many warnings of dangerous cracks in the walls reported to supervisors, police and the media earlier in the week, thousands were still sent to work on Wednesday to proceed with business as usual. There's no question that this building collapse is tragic, but for garment workers, it's not surprising. I began working in Bangladesh's garment industry at the age of 12, making just $3 a month. I went to work because my father had a stroke and the family needed money to cover basic living expenses. I worked 23 days in a row, sleeping on the shop floor, taking showers in the factory restroom, drinking unsafe water and being slapped by the supervisor. Bangladesh vs. the U.S.: How much does it cost to make a denim shirt? By the time I was a young woman working at a factory that made clothing for a big U.S. retailer, I knew the time had come for change. The factory owed my coworkers and me overtime wages, but it wanted to pay us only half of what we had earned, making it even harder for us to support our families. So I helped lead a strike to hold our manager accountable. I was fired and blacklisted, but my work was far from over. I later learned labor law, English and computer skills so that I could help win justice for garment workers. Today I lead a worker education and advocacy nonprofit that counts tens of thousands of garment workers as members. Opinion: Who really pays for our cheap clothes? The sad reality is that tragedies like this have become business as usual, advanced by some of the most highly profitable American and international corporations in the world. Last November, 112 workers lost their lives when the Tazreen Fashions factory, which produced garments sold by Wal-mart, Sears and other retailers, caught fire. Much like New York's infamous Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire more than 100 years ago, the workers at Tazreen were trapped inside, with many jumping from upper story windows to try to save themselves. The death toll at Bangladeshi factories stands at nearly 1,000 since 2006, based on estimates by the Bangladeshi government and an advocacy organization. In the case of these two recent tragedies, there is plenty of blame to go around -- from the Bangladeshi government for looking the other way at safety violations, to the incredibly dangerous circumstances workers face when they try to unionize, to the pressure factory owners and managers are under to turn out high product volume at low prices no matter what. It is the responsibility of the government of Bangladesh to make a sustained, concerted effort to rectify the dire situation. Strict, well-enforced factory codes and clear support for workers' rights are paramount to protecting Bangladesh's garment workforce. But more tragedies can be prevented only if the multinational corporations and retailers whose goods are produced at these factories are willing to stand up and do what is right. A coalition of labor and non-governmental organizations in Bangladesh, Europe and the United States has developed a protocol for an innovative two-year inspection and renovation program to finally make these factories safe -- the Bangladesh Fire and Building Safety Agreement. In addition to facilitating government-supported employer-labor relations and stringent oversight of factory safety management, this protocol focuses on the responsibility of brand owners and retailers to support safety standards. If Wal-mart and its fellow retailers that count on Bangladeshi labor demand change, we can be sure it will happen. As the protocol states, these corporations must verify that the factories they use comply with applicable safety standards. They must ensure that their pricing of garments makes it feasible for the factories to stick to standards. No longer should a Bangladeshi factory manager feel forced to pressure his employees to work in a deadly environment to meet a corporation's bottom line. As for the tragedies that have already taken place, these brands should contribute to worker compensation funds for victims and victims' families, including those in the fire at Tazreen. To date, Wal-mart and Sears have refused to contribute. Both companies maintain that subcontractors had used the factory without their authorization, so they are not responsible. I single out Walmart because its past actions have been painfully inadequate. Walmart has refused to sign onto the protocol designed to enhance fire safety and improve factory structures, saying it is putting its own standards in place, which are perfectly adequate. Yet those are Band-Aid measures that are woefully insufficient. Last fall, Wal-mart refused to admit its connection to the Tazreen factory until my colleagues and I went there the day after the fire and photographed products with Wal-mart's labels in the wreckage. We must no longer tolerate this willful ignorance on the part of multinational corporations about where their goods are produced. It's high time that companies like Wal-mart, The Gap, and others step up and demand the safety of Bangladesh's garment workers. Too many Bangladeshi workers live and work in fear for their lives each day. The fire safety protocol is a critical first step to making real change, and I urge Wal-mart to become a leader in the fight to save Bangladeshi lives.

"(CNN) -- A 47-year-old man from Northern Ireland was found not guilty Friday of murder in the 2009 killings of two British soldiers at an army base in Northern Ireland. Brian Shivers had been accused of killing Patrick Azimkar, 21, and Mark Quinsey, 23, two English soldiers gunned down outside Massereene Barracks. The off-duty and unarmed servicemen were ambushed with gunfire as they collected a pizza delivery at the front gate of the base, hours before they were due to leave for a tour of Afghanistan. They were the first members of the British security forces to be killed in Northern Ireland since the signing of the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998. The Real IRA, a splinter group of the Irish Republican Army, claimed responsibility for the attack. Shivers had been convicted of the murders last year and ordered to serve at least 25 years in jail. The Northern Ireland Court of Appeal quashed that judgment this year after Shivers challenged the trial verdict. He was then ordered to face a retrial. Prosecutors said Shivers' DNA was found on matchsticks and a mobile phone found in and around an abandoned getaway car. The defense said the DNA did not prove he was involved in the shooting and could have been innocently associated with people who used the car. Shivers' attorney has described him as an ""unlikely terrorist"" because he had cystic fibrosis and a doctor had told him he only had a few years to live. The judge effectively sided with the defense, saying the evidence wasn't strong enough. Another man, Colin Duffy, had been acquitted last year. Shivers also was acquitted of attempting to kill four other soldiers and two pizza delivery men and torching a getaway car.","Brian Shivers had been convicted before but the judgment was quashed .

"(CNN) -- Virgin Galactic is one flight closer to becoming a commercial ""spaceline."" The company's passenger spacecraft, SpaceShipTwo, completed its first rocket-powered flight Monday morning above the Mojave Desert in California. About 45 minutes into the flight, SpaceShipTwo was released from its carrier craft, WhiteKnightTwo. Ignition of the rocket motor was triggered, carrying SpaceShipTwo to a maximum altitude of 56,000 feet. During the 16-second engine burn, the spaceship broke the sound barrier, according to a statement from Virgin Galactic.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Clashes in the unsettled western Chinese region of Xinjiang killed 21 people, including police officers and local officials, authorities said Wednesday. The attacks took place Tuesday afternoon after three local officials visiting homes in the area found ""several suspicious persons"" and knives in one house, the Xinjiang government said in a statement. When the officials alerted their superiors of the situation, the people in the house took them hostage, the statement said. Police rushed to the scene, and in the ensuing violence, six of the assailants and 15 other people were killed, it said. Two other people were injured. Police captured eight of the attackers, whom the government described as ""mobsters."" It described the violence as a ""terrorist act."" Some of the knives recovered by police were more than a meter long, according to Hou Hanmin, spokesperson for the Xinjiang government. She told CNN that some of the captured assailants said under interrogation that they had watched videos ""from overseas"" that featured violence and acts of terrorism. ""Then they made those large, lethal knives and wanted to use them for Jihad,"" she said, referring to the Arabic term meaning ""struggle."" ""They had been training in their own house for several months. They were affected by extremism and hoped to commit themselves to Jihad."" Xinjiang has been hit by periodic bouts of unrest. The worst violence in decades took place in July 2009, when rioting between Uyghurs and Han Chinese left around 200 people dead and 1,700 injured in the regional capital, Urumqi. Uyghurs are predominantly Muslim ethnic Turks who are linguistically, culturally and religiously distinct from China's majority Han population. The Uyghur American Association, which advocates for Uyghur rights, said the Chinese accounts of the violence this week ""should be viewed with extreme caution given the lack of available details and independent verification of Chinese sources."" The Washington-based association accused Chinese officials of regularly exploiting incidents in the region to use them as evidence of a perceived terrorist plot against the Chinese state. ""The Chinese government regularly makes terror allegations against Uyghurs without producing evidence to back up their claims or allowing international investigators to independently verify their version of events,"" the association said in a statement Wednesday. Chinese authorities have cracked down on those they accuse of fomenting unrest in the region. As is often the case, the government statement about Tuesday's clash didn't specify the ethnicity of the assailants. But it said that the 15 people killed who weren't ""mobsters"" comprised 10 Uyghurs, three Han, and two Mongolians. The latest violence occurred in Bachu County, east of the city of Kashgar. CNN's Ivan Watson and Feng Ke in Beijing contributed to this report.","NEW: The Uyghur American Association questions the Chinese version of events .

"(CNN) -- Your Instagram profile is about to have a lot more ""you"" in it. Instagram announced a feature on Thursday called Photos of You that lets people tag their own images with the Instagram handles of friends or anyone with an account on Instagram. Previously, you had to call out people in photo captions, and they would get a news alert pointing them to the image. The Photos of You feature is available as an app update for iOS and Android users immediately. Tagged images are collected in a new section in your profile and won't show up in your main photo feed. You can't tag other people's images, only your own. Instagram says these new tags can be populated only with usernames, not hashtags, though hashtags still work just fine in the comments. To check whether a photo has any people tags, tap once on the images, and the names will appear. Click a name to go to that profile. With tagging, of course, comes the potential for embarrassment. Instagram has created a built-in way to hide tagged photos you don't like from your your profile. If an image is extra unflattering, you can remove it altogether or report it as inappropriate. If you're super paranoid, you can turn on a setting to require your approval before any tagged photos show up in your profile. Instagram will show your tagged images by default starting May 16, so if you want to turn on settings to hide them, you have some time to make the proper adjustments. It's no secret that people spend a lot of time on Instagram. Between posting photos, tinkering with filters, creating hashtags and browsing streams, the average user spends about four hours a month on the photo-sharing platform, according to comScore. The new Photos of You feature has a good shot at increasing that time, adding a whole new way to look through old memories, admire your own good looks or see even more of what your friends are up to.","Instagram releases 'Photos of You' feature to add tagging .

"Miami (CNN) -- Thanksgiving is a deeply meaningful annual ritual for Americans. It is singled out as the day to recall a gathering nearly 400 years ago when two clashing cultures -- the Pilgrims and Native Americans -- came together in feast and prayer. That's the history every American kindergartener making a construction-paper turkey is taught; that's the history of cultural cooperation, acceptance and gratitude we celebrate each November. Today, two distinct cultures, Anglo-Protestant and Hispanic, are on the brink of profound and irrevocable change in America, with immigration a perennially and increasingly thorny political issue. There is President Barack Obama's promise of comprehensive immigration reform in the first year of his administration, ""a priority I will pursue from my very first day,"" which has not come to pass. Instead, he has deported 1.2 million Latinos, including 46,000 parents of American citizens. His draconian actions have left tens of thousands of frightened children, whose moms and dads suddenly vanished, living in foster care or as wards of the state. Then there's the inflammatory rhetoric from GOP presidential candidates, topped by Herman Cain's suggestion to build an electrified fence on the border and deploy troops to attack those who try to enter the country illegally. What we are witnessing is a clash of cultures in America that is as excessive as it is pointless. The late Samuel P. Huntington, a renowned Harvard political scientist, illustrated it in a 2004 essay for Foreign Policy magazine titled the ""The Hispanic Challenge,"" in which he wrote: ""Profound cultural differences clearly separate Mexicans and Americans, and the high level of immigration from Mexico sustains and reinforces the prevalence of Mexican values among Mexican-Americans. Continuation of this large immigration (without improved assimilation) could divide the United States into a country of two languages and two cultures."" Huntington concluded his essay by discounting Latino author Lionel Sosa, author of ""The Americano Dream,"" who wrote that the Americano dream ""exists, it is realistic, and it is there for all of us to share."" Huntington declares, ""There is no Americano dream. There is only the American dream created by an Anglo-Protestant society. Mexican Americans will share in that dream and in that society only if they dream in English."" Who are the Americanos? We are the 50 million U.S. citizens of all skin colors, nationalities and religions who descend from a rich Spanish culture -- a culture that Anglophile academics like Huntington have erased from our history books. I observed this firsthand while serving on Florida's State Board of Education, overseeing the approval of statewide textbooks. American history books typically ignore the epic northward advance by Spanish pioneers into the southern tier of the United States and fail to discuss the far-reaching contributions of Americanos from our country's inception to its present day. For example: . -- Forty-two years before the English colony at Jamestown, explorer Pedro Menendez founded St. Augustine as our first North American city in 1565, granting Florida the longest recorded history of any state. The Spanish flag flew over St. Augustine for nearly 200 years. -- When the Continental Army was nearly bankrupt, they sent a representative to seek funds in Cuba, and the money they needed was collected from the public treasury and from private Americano citizens to finance the Battle of Yorktown, the decisive battle of the Revolutionary War. -- The patriotism of Americanos cannot be questioned. Americano soldiers have served in the U.S. Armed Forces dating back from the American Revolution to the war in Afghanistan with 44 Medal of Honor recipients. About half a million Americanos fought the Axis powers during World War II. Lance Cpl. Jose Gutierrez was the first person to die in the Iraq War, and more than 25% of the 58,195 names on the Vietnam War Memorial are Americanos. -- Spanish, not English, was the first European language spoken in North America. There are more than 1,000 U.S. cities with Spanish names, as well as the states of California, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Montana and Florida. The U.S. is the second-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world. Most Americanos are bilingual, which is a plus since our exports to Latin America are nearly three times larger than our exports to China. Americano language skills and cultural affinity give our country a competitive advantage in doing business with a rapidly growing $6.4 trillion market of 579 million people in 21 countries plus Puerto Rico. Oh, and about that first Thanksgiving? Here are a couple of other things our children's history books fail to mention: . -- In St. Augustine on September 8, 1565, the Spanish and the native Timucua celebrated what could arguably be called the first feast of Thanksgiving. That was 56 years before Plymouth. -- Near El Paso on April 20, 1598, some 500 colonists led by Juan de OÃ±ate celebrated the end of a grueling expedition across Mexico's Chihuahua Desert. That was 23 years before Plymouth. Their Thanksgiving celebration with Native Americans is recognized in resolutions by the Texas legislature. Perhaps if the four million children in U.S. kindergartens this year -- 25% of whom are Americanos -- were taught the truth, not only about the rich history of Americanos in helping make this country so great, but also about Thanksgiving, this most American of holidays, then maybe we would have a healthier attitude on immigration reform and Americanos in general. The truth. Surely that's something for which we can all be thankful.

"San Jose, Costa Rica (CNN) -- As U.S. President Barack Obama prepares to head to Costa Rica to meet with Central American leaders on Friday, a top official there says he's sensed a shift in how Obama's administration views the region. ""In the first term, we noticed indifference,"" Costa Rican Foreign Minister Enrique Castillo told CNN en Español this week. ""This gesture of coming to Costa Rica and meeting with the Central American presidents is a change."" So are the priorities officials have said they hope to discuss, Castillo said, including development, trade and improving the climate for investments. Before Obama headed to Mexico for the first stop on his Latin America trip this week, administration officials said they hoped to focus on economic matters. ""It's an important chance to show how important Latin America is to our foreign policy and to our economy,"" said Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser. But even as Obama and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto stressed the importance of deepening economic ties in Mexico Thursday, security issues loomed large over their meeting. The same may be true in Central America, where drug trafficking and security issues remain a top concern. In addition to meeting with Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla, Obama will meet with leaders from Belize, Guatemala, Honduras El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Panama and Nicaragua. ""There he'll be able to talk about what we're doing together to combat the extraordinary violence that has ravaged Central America in recent years,"" Rhodes said, ""through greater cooperation and resources from the united states, but also sharing of best practices from within Central America. Fostering greater cooperation between Central American countries on security matters could be a key role for Obama to play, said Jason Marczak, director of policy at the Americas Society and Council of the Americas. ""He is going to try to use it (his visit) to encourage the Central American governments to work more closely together on security issues. ... There is a challenge in Central America because many times the governments do not work together in regard to this issue,"" Marczak said. But even with significant security concerns, one expert told CNN en Español it's important to focus on economic issues, which fuel drug violence. ""There needs to be economic development,"" analyst Constantino Urcuyo said, ""so there is not migration and so there is not a social base that feeds drug trafficking."" Journalist Djenane Villanueva reported from San Jose, Costa Rica. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet wrote the story in Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- The eight airlines around the world that have the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in their fleets are set to resume commercial flights of the aircraft by early June. Qatar Airways was the latest airline to confirm it would resume Dreamliner flights between Doha and Dubai this week and a longer service from Doha to London's Heathrow starting May 15. Ethiopian Airlines was the first to recommence passenger flights with a service from Addis Ababa to Nairobi, Kenya, on Saturday. Boeing Dreamliner back in skies in Ethiopia . This week, Japan authorized passenger airlines to resume flying the aircraft in the country starting Friday, officials said. Dreamliner takes flight in Japan . All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines, which account for 24 of the 50 Dreamliners delivered by Boeing thus far, earlier announced they would resume commercial 787 flights on June 1. United Airlines -- the only U.S. airline to take delivery of the 787 -- has announced it would resume Dreamliner flights from May 31, initially serving the domestic Houston-Denver route. United plans 787 resumption . Polish carrier LOT is planning to resume services June 5, while Air India has said in local reports it is planning to reintroduce its Dreamliners to the skies in May. Chilean airline LAN has announced it plans flights in June. The resumption of services ends a worldwide grounding of the ultra modern Dreamliner of more than three months, after two incidents on jets operated by Japanese airlines called the battery systems into question. Officials later pointed to faulty battery systems in recommending the planes be grounded. Last week, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration cleared Boeing to make fixes to the problematic battery system. Boeing said it was deploying teams to help the airlines install the redesigned system. In an online posting last Thursday, the FAA outlined the modifications necessary for the Dreamliner to fly again. The Dreamliner's use of lightweight composite materials to greatly improve fuel economy has made it a big seller in Asia and the Middle East, where long-haul flights account for much of an airline's business.

"(CNN) -- Silently huddled on the water's edge, waiting hours on end for a hint of action, may not be everyone's idea of a pleasurable pastime. But the joy of fishing -- much like its catch -- comes in many shapes and sizes. From wrestling ferocious Amazonian amphibians, to casting a reel in the shadow of Cinderella's Castle, here are our top five aquatic expeditions to expand the mind and get your pulse racing. Pretty fly fishing . A luxury Aspen hotel gives new meaning to the term ""fly-fishing"" by offering helicopter rides over the dramatic Rocky Mountains to a secluded lake. Guests at Colorado's five-star Little Nell's Hotel are flown to a private ranch where they can fly-fish for trophy trout. Requiring a gentle touch and the stamina to withstand long hours knee-deep in water, fly-fishing is not for the fainthearted. But instructors are on hand to show beginners the tricks of this historic trade. Those lucky enough to catch a trout can also enjoy it for dinner that night, after learning the secrets of seafood cooking in a class run by the hotel's chef. Lobster hunting . Called the ""black gold"" of the sea, lobsters are some of the most elusive -- and prized -- catches of the ocean. One of the best places in the world to get up close to these monstrous delicacies is the remote Great Orme coastline in north Wales. The Lobster Safari offers boat trips beside the towering cliffs, with on-board marine biologist Carl Davies explaining the process behind catching the elusive creatures in huge traps, known as pots. ""During the trip we haul numerous lobster pots so guests can see them up close and have an opportunity to handle the lobsters -- and for that matter a whole host of other marine creatures also caught in the pots,"" Davies said. ""They can also spot other wildlife, like seabirds, seals, sometimes bottle nosed dolphins and the famous Kashmiri goats that live wild on the Orme."" Finding the real Nemo . Along with playing catch and learning to ride a bike, fishing has long been viewed as a defining parent-child bonding experience. But if the promise of the great outdoors and quality time with the folks isn't enough to lure youngsters outside, perhaps Disney World is. Along with magical rides and stage shows, the Florida theme park also offers waterways teeming with bass. Families can cast their rods against the backdrop of Cinderella's Castle, all with the help of angling experts. During the 1960s, more than 70,000 bass fingerlings were released into the Magic Kingdom's Bay Lake and Seven Seas Lagoon and left to grow and breed undisturbed for almost 20 years. Today, guests can try their luck catching the adult fish, weighing up to 6.5 kilograms. Amazon adventure . When it comes to ferocious fish, the South American peacock bass didn't earn the nickname ""freshwater bully"" for nothing. With its striking green and gold coloring, aggressive nature, and hefty size, catching the Amazonian fish can often appear as a spectacular wrestling match between man and beast. But fearless fishermen can try their hand at the action from the comfort of a traditional three-deck river boat, while meandering down Brazil's exotic waterways. ""The peacock bass is undoubtedly the world's most aggressive, hard-fighting freshwater fish,"" said Steve Townson, director of the Black Water Explorer expedition. ""When a peacock bass slams a topwater lure, it's like a bomb going off."" A real pearler . Nestled in between the windswept mountains of Ireland's west coast, lies the dramatic Killary Harbor -- a breathtaking 16-kilometer fjord, plunging 45-meters deep below the surface. The piercing blue glacial fjord is also home to one of the largest -- and cleanest -- collections of shellfish in Europe. Guests at the nearby 1830s-era Delphi Lodge country house can cruise along the spectacular waterway in a speedboat, stopping at the historic oyster and mussel farms dotted along its rim. The day trip includes farming demonstrations and a chance to sample the freshly cooked produce with a glass of the nation's iconic drink -- Guinness.","A look at the top five fishing expeditions from across the world .

"(CNN) -- In these days of austerity, thin profit margins, low competitiveness and high unemployment, we often hear of companies braving the economic storm with innovation and ingenuity. For niche businesses, this can work. Others, however, need to think carefully about a plan of attack. It's not just a question of turning your attention to international markets in the hope of making up the bleak numbers at home. Advice from chief executives suggests you need to know your markets, tweak your products and then push your brand. Fuller, Smith & Turner have been doing just that. And it's led to them exporting around 12 million pints of beer a year. Founded in 1654, the brewery has seen its fair share of economic difficulties. But this time the crisis is twofold: The economic crisis facing Europe and the impact of beer duty at home. Despite the deepening crisis in Western Europe, Michael Turner, chairman of Fuller, Smith & Turner, told me the latter crisis was his bigger concern. The British government introduced a 2% duty on beer and wine back in 2008, but since then it has reportedly increased 42%. That, Turner tells me, is crippling the industry and sapping demand for its product in the UK. According to Turner: ""We pay, in this country, 40% of all the beer duty for the whole of the EU and we have something like twelve times the amount of tax that the Germans do."" That tax burden forced Fuller, Smith & Turner to seek out new sources of income. And so the company turned its attention to exports. It now exports to 68 countries around the world, roughly the equivalent of twelve million pints per year. The company increased volumes by 200% in the last five years. Traditional beers such as London Pride and London Black Cab have also benefited from what's been dubbed ""the London-effect,"" that came with hosting the Olympics, celebrating the Jubilee and the royal wedding. But Fuller, Smith & Turner has also adjusted its product to suit each market. The U.S. has become one of their biggest export markets. Tax in the U.S. is per bottle rather than then by alcohol level, and Fuller, Smith & Turner has successfully tapped the market by selling a wide variety of drinks with different alcohol levels. It has adapted the aesthetic slightly by selling them in cardboard baskets rather than in plastic packs. Scandinavia and Italy, meanwhile, prefer draft beer, even if that's 8.5% alcohol content. To keep up with such international demands, the company, which has always been based in London, has had to invest in its facility. Turner told me the company had spent $9 million extending the already crammed brewery. Robots were brought in to maximize space and allow for the quick loading and unloading of kegs and beer pallets. A new production line that cleans, sterilizes and fills beer kegs has also been introduced, allowing for greater capacity. Jeff Hack-Davies, the company's packaging operations manager, tells me this line alone has enabled them to produce 60 to 70 thousand kegs per week compared to 3,000 eight years ago. It's an investment that has enabled them to keep up with international thirst for its beers and in turn beat the gloom in the UK. If that weren't enough, this London brewery is also overturning the common perception abroad that British beer is warm, weak and undrinkable.","Fuller, Smith & Turner demand that has seen volumes increase by 200% in the last five years .

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho, the self-appointed ""Special One"", was the man charged with winning the European Champions League and finally recognizing the dream of ""La Decima."" Instead, should he leave this summer, his epitaph will read ""decimated"". Just minutes after watching his Real Madrid blow its chance of an unprecedented tenth triumph in Europe's elite competition Tuesday, Mourinho was already busy plotting his escape route from the Spanish capital following his fifth semifinal defeat in seven attempts. ""I want to be where people love me to be,"" he told ITV immediately after the game. Just quite how much love there is in Madrid for Mourinho is open for debate, but his side's 2-0 victory was not enough to earn him the opportunity to become the first man to win the competition with three different clubs. Last week's humiliating 4-1 defeat in Dortmund left Real with an uphill struggle and despite late goals from Karim Benzema and Sergio Ramos, it failed to take advantage of the number of glorious chances which came its way. Now, all eyes are on Mourinho, with former employers Chelsea just one of several high profile clubs likely to be interested in employing the Portuguese coach. But the 50-year-old, who left Stamford Bridge in September 2007 in acrimonious circumstances, insists he will wait until the end of the season before making a decision. Real sits 11 points behind league leader and arch rival Barcelona in the title race, while it faces city neighbor Atletico Madrid in the final of the Copa del Rey, the country's top domestic cup competition. ""I didn't make a decision because I have a contract and more than that, because in football people break contracts when they want to, is the respect I have for the club and the president,"" he told a press conference. ""It's why I want to play the [Copa del Rey] final and win the cup and finish second in the league. I want to sit with my president, my friend, and decide the best for me."" Last year's league title win seems a long time ago now. Mourinho's reign has been tempestuous from the very moment he arrived in May 2010. Style of play which has frustrated supporters, a falling out club captain Iker Casillas and a constant war of words with the Spanish media has not helped his case. ""I know in England I am loved by the fans, the media they treat me in a fair way,"" he explained to reporters. ""I know I am loved by some clubs, especially one. In Spain the situation is a bit different because some people hate me. ""Many of you are in this room. It's difficult to make a decision because I like the club and we made a fantastic team that is ready to do big things. ""I need to be honest and fair. At the end of the season I will speak."" Mourinho's mood may have been different had Real profited from the number of opportunities gifted to it by a youthful and inexperienced Dortmund side. Robert Lewandowski's four-goal salvo in Germany last week had given the visiting side a cushion of comfort heading into the encounter. But manager Jurgen Klopp was left sweating on the touchlines as his players held on to amidst a barrage of pressure from the home side. ""It isn't too hard to reveal what I thought during those last 10 minutes: if God wished it then we would qualify for the final,"" he told a press conference. ""But it has to be said that it was a crazy match, from start to finish."" Trailing 4-1 from the first leg, Real needed a fast start and it almost got one when Gonzalo Higuain ran through on goal only to shoot straight at Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller. Dortmund, which was forced into an early change following an injury to influential playmaker Mario Goetze, appeared nervous as Real continued to pile on the pressure. Those nerves should have been increased when Mesut Ozil escaped the Dortmund defense, but fired his effort wide of the post with just the goalkeeper to beat. Ronaldo was next to go close, this time sending a close range volley straight against Weidenfeller when he looked certain to score. With the home side consistently failing to take its chances, Dortmund began to grown in stature and Jakub Blaszczykowski should have done better after meeting Lukasz Piszczek's cutback. Dortmund, which drew 2-2 in Madrid during the group stage of the competition, continued to create opportunities after the break and Lewandowski fired over when well placed. The Polish striker should have given his side the lead on the night just minutes later when he burst clear of the Real defense, but his thunderous effort cannoned against the crossbar and bounced down to safety. The German side then went close again when Ilkay Gundogan's close-range effort forced Diego Lopez into a stunning save to keep the scores level. Mourinho threw on Kaka and Benzema to try and inspire Real and the pair gave the home side a fresh impetus going forward. Twice Angel Di Maria went close before Real finally made the breakthrough with eight minutes remaining. After watching Lewandowski go close at the other end, the home side broke at pace and Benzema swept the ball past Weidenfeller after connecting with Ozil's pass. Benzema then set up Ramos six minutes later to leave Real within touching distance, but that elusive goal just wouldn't come. ""It's a shame,"" Ramos told reporters. ""Sometimes you lose, that is football. ""In Dortmund we should have played the way we did tonight. We feel for the fans. It's a shame to have been so close but the missed chances in the first half were costly."" For Mourinho, the tie was lost on German soil a week ago, a result which condemned Real to becoming the first team to suffer three consecutive semifinal defeats. He told ITV: ""In football you win or you lose. I think we could have won. They had a couple of big chances but that was a consequence of the way we were playing late on where we risked everything. ""Today we were a team with character and desire and we could have done it. ""I don't forget the first match, we were very bad and we were punished because of the result of the first leg."" The prospect of an all-German final now looms large with Bayern Munich taking a 4-0 lead to the Camp Nou to face Barcelona Wednesday. But while Bayern still has work to do, Dortmund can now relax in the knowledge they have booked a dream date with destiny, despite suffering a first defeat of the competition. ""We knew if they scored a goal in the first half, the crowd would get euphoric and loud,"" Mats Hummels told ITV. ""We had the game under control but with the goal the whole game changed - like the game against Malaga. ""It's unbelievable; something everyone in the team dreamed of since being an child. Some of us are still children. We are looking forward to Wembley.""","Borussia Dortmund is through to the Champions League final at Wembley .

"North Kingstown, Rhode Island (CNN) -- What does Katherine Russell know? We're not the only ones who want answers to that question. According to a number of federal officials, investigators have plenty of questions for the widow of slain Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev: . What might she have known, if anything, about his activities in the days and months preceding the April 15 bombings? About his travel and associations? And then there's that phone call law enforcement sources say Russell placed to her husband after authorities released pictures identifying him as a suspect in the bombings. What was up with that? If it sounds like there are more questions than answers, you're right. Investigators haven't said what, if anything they know about what Russell knew before and after the bombings, which left three people dead and more than 260 wounded. Four people have been charged in connection with the bombing, including Russell's brother-in-law, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is suspected of carrying out the attack along with his brother, Tamerlan, 26. The older brother died April 19 after a firefight with police, hours after authorities released images of the suspected bombers. Three of Dzhokhar's friends were charged Wednesday, accused of helping cover his tracks after the bombing. Authorities allege two of the men disposed of potentially incriminating items from Dzhokhar's dorm room and a bag containing fireworks; the other allegedly made false statements to police. A laptop belonging to Dzhokhar is now in FBI custody, two federal law enforcement officials told CNN. A lawyer for one of the suspect's accused friends said his client turned it over. Who is Katherine Russell? Friends describe Russell, a 2007 graduate of North Kingstown High School, as ""artistic,"" ""normal"" and ""well-liked,"" a fan of the rock singer David Bowie. She had one dustup with the law -- a June 2007 arrest for stealing $67 in goods from Old Navy. She acknowledged the theft and gave back the merchandise, according to court records. Later that year, she moved to Boston and enrolled at Suffolk University. Then she met Tamerlan Tsarnaev at a nightclub. Russell dropped out of school her freshman year, converting to Islam before the couple married in a Massachusetts mosque in June 2010. A daughter, now 3, came soon after. She reportedly worked long hours as a home health aide while her husband stayed home to care for the child. Did she know? According to her attorney, Amato DeLuca, the 24-year-old widow knew nothing of plans to bomb the race, and reports of her husband's involvement came as an ""absolute shock"" to Russell and her family. But tantalizing clues that have leaked into public have helped keep the spotlight on Russell, a Rhode Island native. For one, law enforcement sources told CNN last week that a woman's DNA had been found on a fragment of a pressure cooker used in the attack. Now, that DNA could have come from anyone -- from a clerk at the store where the Tsarnaev brothers allegedly bought the pressure cookers to a victim of the bombings. And even if DNA samples last week show the genetic material was Russell's, one of the sources cautioned, it wouldn't prove Russell had done anything criminal at all. After all, lots of people handle pressure cookers every day in kitchens across America. More recently, two sources familiar with the investigation told CNN that Russell had spoken with Tamerlan after his picture appeared on national television April 18. What exactly the two said remains under investigation, the sources said. Investigators may be able to recover the conversation, said Tom Clemente, a former counterterrorism agent for the FBI. ""We certainly have ways in national security investigations to find out exactly what was said in that conversation,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday, adding that ""all of that stuff is being captured as we speak whether we know it or like it or not."" ""It's not necessarily something that the FBI is going to want to present in court, but it may help lead the investigation and/or lead to questioning of her,"" he said. Legal questions . More questions arise when it comes to what legal obligation Russell might have had to inform authorities of her husband's identity once the photos went public. Russell didn't have any legal requirement to call authorities on learning her husband was potentially involved, criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos told Burnett. Spouses can't be compelled to testify against each other in criminal cases. ""Maybe from a moral standpoint she would have wanted to do that,"" he said. CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said he didn't believe Russell would be able to enjoy ""spousal privilege"" against investigators' questions. ""The wife of a criminal defendant generally gets a spousal privilege"" if there is a discussion that happened within the context of the marriage, Callan said. ""It's protected. That's what spousal privilege is about. But when the husband dies, and where he has revealed what he has told his wife to a criminal co-conspirator, the communication is no longer confidential and the wife cannot claim spousal privilege protection."" The privilege is ""really only meant to protect confidential communications to protect the institution of marriage,"" he said. Russell can still assert the Fifth Amendment to protect herself, unless she gets immunity from prosecutors, he said. Defense attorneys often seek immunity for their clients in exchange for providing authorities with information. ""Her lawyer is probably sitting down with her, very worried about the fact that she may face charges herself, depending on the knowledge of the plot,"" Callan said. ""She has to have good information to get a deal from the feds, and that's what we don't know about at this point -- what kind of information to trade."" Russell's day-to-day life . In the meantime, Russell remains largely out of view inside her parents' North Kingstown home, a fleet of unmarked law enforcement vehicles outside whenever she is there. The federal presence has caused such a disruption the local police have stepped up patrols in the neighborhood out of concern for the Russell family. She emerges about once a day, often wearing a leopard-print hijab, to travel to her attorney's office in Providence, where she meets with lawyers and federal investigators. The nature of those meetings remains unclear. While she has not spoken with the public, her attorneys have said Russell is distraught over the loss of life and injuries suffered by bombing victims. ""She cries a lot,"" DeLuca said last week. Erin McPike and Aaron Cooper reported from North Kingston; Michael Pearson wrote from Atlanta; CNN's Carol Cratty, Rachel Streitfeld, Susan Candiotti, Deb Feyerick, Gloria Borger and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","FBI, and America, have questions for suspected bomber's widow .

"(CNN) -- ""Terrorists use Guantanamo Bay prison to recruit new members."" Aasif Mandvi, ""The Daily Show's"" senior correspondent, passionately made this argument as our first guest ever on the weekly CNN podcast ""The Big Three."" Mandvi thinks it's time to close Guantanamo Bay now -- and I couldn't agree with him more. President Obama brought this issue back to the forefront when he renewed his call to close the prison facility. Obama explained at his press conference on Tuesday: ""It is critical for us to understand that Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe. ... It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It is a recruiting tool for extremists."" Mandvi echoed President Obama's sentiments that the United States cannot simply hold people indefinitely without affording them the opportunity to answer the charges against them. ""Why can't we try these prisoners in court? We have done that with other terrorists like Timothy McVeigh,"" Mandvi said. Mandvi, who appeared in the Off-Broadway play, ""Guantanamo,"" and can be seen in the soon-to-be-released comedy film, ""The Internship,"" spoke about his discussion with the father of a Guantanamo detainee. The father made a simple plea to Mandvi: ""Try my son in court, and if you find him guilty of being a terrorist, execute him. If not, then let him go."" There are 166 prisoners in the prison. Eighty-six of them have been cleared for release by our government but have still not been set free. Many of these prisoners are on a hunger strike to protest their indefinite detention. In response, prison officials are force-feeding them by inserting tubes through their nasal passages, a practice that the U.N. Human Rights Office declared as torture. Should the U.S. government close Gitmo and put the prisoners not cleared for release on trial? That's the first issue in this week's episode of ""The Big Three,"" which features CNN contributors Margaret Hoover, John Avlon and me. Here is a brief summary of the big three issues we took on: . 1. Guantanamo Bay Prison -- close it now? Our guest, Mandvi, emphatically argued yes. Hoover noted that more than 40 of the prisoners have been deemed too violent to ever be released. Avlon expressed concerns that national security secrets could be released if these prisoners were tried in open court. 2. Is Jason Collins, the NBA player who came out of the closet, the Jackie Robinson of gay athletes?  While all three of us applauded Collins' courage in coming out, we disagreed over its significance when compared to Jackie Robinson. Avlon argued that Robinson was far more important because racism was a much more polarizing issue at the time and also, Robinson was a far superior athlete. We all agreed, though some of the criticism Collins received makes it clear the fight to end homophobia still has a long way to go. 3. Who will voters pick in the congressional special election in South Carolina next week? Mark Sanford, a Republican former governor who famously cheated on his wife by sneaking off to Argentina, or Elizabeth Colbert Busch, a liberal-ish Democrat who is the sister of Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert? Avlon was the moderator of a recent debate between Sanford and Busch. Some were shocked that Busch brought up Sanford's past affair. I'm not shocked. In fact, I think it tells us a great deal about Sanford's character. Avlon argued that many have forgiven Bill Clinton for his escapades, why shouldn't Sanford get a second chance? Hoover noted that the demographics of the district are becoming moderate, which can help Busch win the May 7 election. We would love to hear your thoughts on these issues.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Open tennis champion Andy Murray has condemned the handling of the Operation Puerto doping trial by the Spanish authorities, accusing them of the ""biggest cover up in sports history."" A criminal trial in Spain concluded Tuesday with sports doctor Eufemiano Fuentes given a one-year jail term for supplying cyclists with blood transfusions to boost their performance. But the judge hearing the case, Julia Patricia Santamaria, ordered that over 200 bags of blood and plasma seized from Fuentes, be destroyed, pending any appeals. Murray, an outspoken critic of doping, used his Twitter blog to express his frustration. ""Puerto case is beyond a joke... biggest cover up in sports history?,"" he tweeted . ""Why would court order blood bags to be destroyed? #coverup."" During his trial, Fuentes gave evidence that he had clients from other sports, including tennis, football, boxing and athletics, but did not identify them. At the time of his arrest and the raids on his premises in 2006, doping was not a criminal offense in Spain, but he was found guilty of endangering public health. He was also barred from practicing as a sports doctor for four years, but under the Spanish legal system his jail term will be suspended. The World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) also expressed its disagreement with the court decision Wednesday. ""The decision to order the destruction of all the blood bags is particularly disappointing and unsatisfactory for WADA, and the whole anti-doping community,"" it said in a statement. ""Access to this evidence motivated WADA's involvement in this case. This would ensure appropriate sports sanction processes against the cheats who used Dr Fuentes' services."" WADA said it was reviewing its next course of action in conjunction with the Spanish National Anti-Doping Organization (AEA). The deadline to appeal the court decision is May 17 . The International Olympic Committee signaled its frustration with the court ruling Wednesday. ""It's unfortunate that the evidence used in this proceeding is not now being made available to anti-doping organizations to further the fight against doping,"" it said in a statement. British No.1 Murray went public in February with his demand for more blood testing in tennis, saying it needed to do everything it could ""to ensure that everyone competing at the highest level and below is clean."" He was joined by fellow grand slam winners Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal in demanding stricter tests and in March the International Tennis Federation announced it would be introducing a Biological Passport program - a more stringent control against doping.","Andy Murray condemns outcome of Operation Puerto doping trial .

""I don't think people would sign up for the facebook thing if they knew it was for dating,"" Zuckerberg wrote at the time in an IM chat with his close high school friend Adam D'Angelo, who became Facebook's CTO and eventually went on to co-found Quora. ""I think people are skeptical about joining dating things too."" Though the look and feel of Facebook has changed in the years since, Zuckerberg and employees at the company have generally refrained from referring to the social network as a dating site, and from going after the online dating industry. That's why it was so striking to see Facebook tease a feature clearly intended for dating during the company's big press event on Tuesday for Graph Search, a new search engine that lets members use natural language to pull up recommendations for people, places and businesses from their social graph. Facebook reps demonstrated several uses for the product, ranging from recruiting to searching for restaurant recommendations. Then, at one point, a Facebook employee stood on stage and searched for ""friends of my friends who are single and living in San Francisco."" With that simple line, Facebook asserted itself as a potentially big player in the future of online dating. ""Facebook just announced that they are moving in on the essence of online dating,"" said Dan Slater, author of Love in the Time of Algorithms, a history of online dating and its impact on our culture, which comes out next Tuesday. The bedrock of most dating sites, according to Slater, has been the ability to discover people you don't know who share similar interests, whereas Facebook's focus was on helping you find the people you do know. Graph Search changes that by making it much easier to search for people outside your immediate social circle. ""That is a radical change for a community as big as Facebook."" With Graph Search, Facebook members can search for other single users and filter the results based on their interests, education, age, hometown, current city and more — all while using natural language. If you want to find single women under the age of 35 who are from your hometown and now live in New York, you can type exactly that into the search engine and see what pops up. Can Facebook really be used for online dating? At first blush, it might seem obvious that Facebook could be used for dating purposes. The social network has long served as a place to flirt by letting users advertise their relationship statuses, stalk one another's updates and Poke people they might be interested in. Indeed, one study last year from Stanford found that about 10% of couples who met online knew each other first in some other context and re-connected through a social network like Facebook. That said, several startups have tried in recent years to leverage Facebook's social graph for dating, but with only mixed success. Kingfish Labs raised $500,000 in early 2012 to use Facebook for dating, but its first Facebook application, Yoke, struggled to take off and the company itself was later acquired by BuzzFeed. Yoke was able to rely on Facebook data to help its users find people who shared connections and interests with them, but the problem the dating app faced was providing a way for users to get in touch with those people. ""Cold friending or cold messaging someone on Facebook is uncomfortable because you don't know if the other person wants to be approached. On OkCupid it's not uncomfortable, it's standard,"" Rob Fishman,co-founder of Kingfish Labs, told Mashable. The assumption is that everyone on OkCupid is interested in dating, but on Facebook, even those who label themselves as ""single"" may not be in the market for a new relationship. ""There is no way for the third party to signal that 'yes, I want a date to approach me.'"" More fundamentally, Fishman says that his company found Facebook's Like data was often not fresh or comprehensive enough to serve as a match-making tool. ""Facebook Like data is actually pretty sparse and stale,"" Fishman says. ""If I asked you what your favorite movies are and went to your movies section on Facebook, I don't think they would match up. On OkCupid, people curate their profiles with a scalpel."" These two problems will likely limit the potential of Graph Search as a dating tool for now, but Fishman suggests this could change in the future if Facebook adds additional relationship status options like ""Looking for a date,"" and if the social network can accrue enough real-time interest data for users from its partnerships with other websites. ""Someone is going to crack the nut of Facebook dating,"" Fishman says. ""It might well be Facebook."" A more casual place to date online . The larger question then is whether Facebook can or will ever take on the big players in the online dating space. Investors appear to be concerned about this possibility, as the stock for IAC/InterActiveCorp — the parent company of Match and OkCupid — dropped by more than 2% after Facebook announced Graph Search on Tuesday. ""I think the online dating business has to be looking at this announcement and saying this could either be the best thing ever for us, or it could be the beginning of the end,"" Slater says. If members of existing dating sites are successful in finding matches through Facebook, it could cut into their business. On the other hand, Slater says, Facebook could potentially help the industry by removing whatever ""cultural barrier"" remains for online dating. About a third of the single population in the U.S. currently uses online dating sites — a number that has been relatively flat in recent years. Both Slater and Fishman suggest that Facebook has the potential to make it more common for people to use the Internet to find dates, without necessarily stealing away many customers from other online dating sites. Even before Facebook made its big announcement, Slater says he noticed that a growing number of non-dating platforms are being used for dating purposes, from match-making apps on Spotify to social discovery tools like Highlight. Meanwhile, he says some dating websites are starting to re-brand a bit by taking the ""pink hearts"" off their homepage with the goal of being a little more welcoming to those who might previously have been put off by the idea of online dating. Facebook could fit nicely in this trend by serving as a more general social venue where casual users occasionally browse for dates without necessarily branding themselves as online daters. ""It's very similar to going to a club or a poetry reading or whatever your thing is [to meet people],"" Slater says, whereas ""online dating is more like going to a speed-dating event."" At least in this sense, Facebook could help online dating function a little more like offline dating. See the original article on Mashable.com . © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Every spring, a yellow blanket of pollen descends upon America, eliciting complaints from allergy sufferers already fed up with watery eyes, stuffed-up sinuses and excessive sneezing. If you're wondering exactly what that is covering your car, it's pine pollen, which usually comes out in mid- to late-April. But believe it or not, it's probably not what's causing your symptoms. ""Amazingly enough, most people are not allergic to the stuff you can see,"" CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Instead, it's microscopic particles in the spring air that are hell-bent on causing misery. Most seasonal allergies are caused by smaller tree pollen and mold spores, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. More than 60 million Americans suffer from allergic rhinitis, according to the academy. That means when they inhale something they are allergic to, they suffer symptoms in the nose and eyes. When the trigger of the reaction is pollen, the person is said to have ""hay fever."" Warm, dry climates have the highest pollen levels, according to Pollen.com, while rainy or cool weather significantly reduces allergens in the air. Don't let allergies stop you from traveling . Fortunately for allergy sufferers, 2013 has so far been relatively mild compared to last year, when an unusually warm winter caused the season to start earlier and last longer. Pollen.com breaks the United States down into seven allergy regions. Except for the South Central area, all the regions are recording lower pollen levels than last year at this time, according to IMS Health, the company behind the website. Pollen counts . There are no government pollen trackers, but private companies have stepped in to provide data on pollen levels nationwide. Worst U.S. cities for allergy sufferers . A pollen count signifies how much pollen is in the air. A higher count means people who are allergic are more likely to exhibit symptoms. Pollen counts are calculated using the concentration of pollen in a certain area during a specific period (usually 24 hours), according to Pollen.com. ""(Air-sampling devices) collect particles from the air onto a transparent, sticky surface,"" the website's FAQ page says. ""The sample is then examined under a microscope, where the pollen grains are counted and identified."" The device must be placed on a rooftop at least one story high, away from any significant pollen or mold sources, AAAI.org states, to get an accurate reading. The numbers used to quantify pollen levels vary between collecting stations, and don't mean much to the average consumer, so levels are usually described simply as low, moderate or high. What constitutes a high pollen count also depends on what type of allergen is being tracked, according to AAAI.org. Where do allergies come from? Treating the symptoms . You've got three options for over-the-counter oral antihistamines: Allegra (fexofenadine), Claritin (loratadine) and Zyrtec (cetirizine), but many patients need a prescription nasal spray in addition to one of those in order to find relief. Allergists can prescribe topical nasal antihistamines and steroidal sprays. Antihistamine eye drops are also available over-the-counter and by prescription. The only long-term option for allergy sufferers is to undergo immune therapy, in the form of shots, over three to five years. An allergy test determines what you are allergic to, and then you get tiny doses of that allergen injected until you become desensitized. A method of accomplishing this using droplets under the tongue has shown promise in studies, but is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Bottom line: If you're suffering this spring, allergists can help.","Most people aren't allergic to the yellow pollen you see, which is from pine trees .

"(CNN) -- The first time I viewed an al Qaeda recruitment video, I squinted at a scratchy black blob shimmying across the screen. It took a moment to recognize this was an amateur effort to obliterate the image of a woman from a clip of a politician's visit to Saudi Arabia. The blob was evidently his wife. I wondered at the time it must have taken to erase her from every frame. Of all the rapid-fire images of death and destruction in the video, I found this one the most chilling. That same feeling surfaced in the days after Seal Team Six killed Osama bin Laden two years ago. I watched talking heads on every network hold forth on the takedown. Almost without exception, they were men. I felt like my female colleagues had been erased from the picture. In the 1990s it was largely women who tracked the threat from bin Laden, who pieced together slivers of data to form a surprisingly accurate picture of an international terror network that had yet to announce its existence to the world. When Greg Barker interviewed me for the documentary ""Manhunt,"" he asked what it was that made women so good at tracking terrorists. I felt a moment of panic at being led into the minefield of gender stereotypes. I worried about discounting the efforts of some excellent male counterterrorism analysts I had known. Then I thought to myself, ""Yes, women do have a special genius for the job."" To step firmly into the stereotype minefield, is it because terrorism is all about relationships? Perhaps. Using the Boston bombing as an example, let's look at the mother and how she may have influenced the older son who in turn could have influenced the younger one. At this moment analysts are following that circle of relationships outward, looking at other friends and family members. Analysts are trying to suppress their own egos and put themselves into the minds of the suspected terrorists. What do I need to carry out this attack and to whom do I turn for help? Suppressing one's ego is an important part of being a good counterterrorism analyst. First, you have to be willing to admit up front what you don't know. The amount of data is so large that no one individual can look at all of it. A good analyst acknowledges her blind spots and networks with other analysts to fill them. Bergen: Bin Laden dead, bin Ladenism lives . When it comes to ego suppression, women are just better at it than men. They've had more practice. I ran across one man who never admitted to any gaps in knowledge. Whenever someone would try to tell him something, he would blithely say, ""I knew that."" He didn't last long as a counterterrorism analyst. Another characteristic of the women who tracked bin Laden is that they didn't have their egos so caught up in their ""careers"" that they let it affect their jobs. For an analyst, the path to career advancement lies through a ""hot account,"" which means a subject that attracts policymaker interest. Al Qaeda was not a hot account in the 1990s. Some managers resented the amount of time the women spent on it. On career appraisals, one report written for the policymaker often counted for more than months spent sifting through data and working with counterparts on the clandestine side of the house. Their careers suffered because the women were so focused on the job of tracking al Qaeda. These women had the intellectual discipline and honesty to allow their conclusions to arise from the data, rather than taking the shortcut of cherry-picking the data to fit preconceived notions. For whatever reason, women are particularly good at perceiving patterns in a nonstop stream of seemingly random data. Terrorism analysis requires persistence, tenacity, patience and dedication. The women who tracked bin Laden had those characteristics in spades. In the days after 911, one analyst was working 18-hour days despite severe back pain. When she finally took the time to go to a doctor, she found out she had a broken vertebra. Then she went back to the office and continued to work the long hours. These women broke down in tears, struggled with guilt, depression and the physical impact of stress. They juggled the job with the demands of motherhood, eldercare and other personal issues that don't disappear after a terrorist attack. Through it all they continued to do their jobs, because, by God, they weren't going to let that bastard bin Laden win. I have one urgent request for the CIA, FBI and other relevant agencies. After the next attack, could you please send a woman to talk to the press? You have lots of them and, trust me, they know what they're talking about. Please do it to improve the morale of your female officers and give their daughters a better understanding of their options in life. The women are tired of being invisible. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Susan Hasler.","Susan Hasler: Too often role of women in counterterrorism is de-emphasized .
She says women were instrumental in early days of search for bin Laden .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Malaysia's ruling party has extended its decades-long grip on power after one of the country's most hotly contested parliamentary votes. Prime Minister Najib Razak's Barisan Nasional coalition has ruled Malaysia for 56 years. Razak, the son and nephew of former prime ministers, has been in office since 2009 and appears to have won a new mandate in Sunday's vote, according to results from Malaysia's electoral commission, which reported the coalition won 133 seats in parliament. Razak's leading challenger, Anwar Ibrahim, and his Pakatan Rakyat party -- which won 89 seats, according to the commission -- have not yet conceded the vote, however, alleging widespread vote-rigging before and during the election. Turnout was high, with the election commission saying 80% of eligible Malaysians have voted. The weeks leading up to Sunday's poll saw reports of firebombs, texted death threats and beatings. Just days before polling booths opened, the potential for voter fraud was being alleged after reports that indelible ink used to mark the fingers of advance voters was washing off with water. ""The whole purpose of introducing indelible ink is to cut off multiple voters -- that is now being compromised by low quality ink,"" said Maria Chin Abdullah from BERSIH 2.0, which campaigns for electoral reform. ""The election commissioner had the cheek to tell us they forgot to shake the bottle. How ridiculous can that be, right?"" In a bid to end the claims, Malaysia's election commissioner staged a public demonstration Thursday to prove his assertion that the ink could not in fact be washed off. Other allegations surfaced Sunday, with Ibrahim's party and election observers alleging the government exchanged cash for votes and brought in foreigners to cast their ballots in favor of Barisan Nasional. The ruling coalition disputed the allegations and said the vote was free and fair. Ibrahim, a former finance and deputy prime minister, served time in prison on corruption and sodomy charges which he says were politically motivated. The first sodomy charge was overturned in 2004 and in January 2012 he was acquitted of a second charge of sodomy, a serious offense in Malaysia which carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Ethnic tensions bubble beneath vote . In a hard-fought campaign, both parties tried to entice voters with promises of generous government spending, though analysts say it's ultimately a choice between old and new, the status quo and an untested opposition. ""Both manifestos actually do not contain anything policywise; there are just little giveaways, they promise you this, promise you that but there's not much policy difference between both of them,"" said James Chin, professor of political science at the Malaysian campus of Australia's Monash University. Bubbling under the surface is racial tension that has divided the country ever since Barisan Nasional introduced policies in the 1970s to favor ethnic Malays. The country's constitution effectively splits the country between Bumiputera, or ethnic Malays, and natives of Sarawak and Sabah, and citizens of mostly Chinese or Indian descent. According to the CIA World Factbook, just over 50% of the country is Malay, while Chinese make up 23.7% and Indians 7.1%. There are set government quotas on how much of the country's wealth should be held by Bumiputera. They are entitled to discounts on housing and must be offered enough stock in a company if it wants to be listed on the stock exchange. The policy has created discontent that the opposition harnessed in its campaign, saying the policies must be reformed to create a more open society. But one analyst said a PR win would not mean wholesale change. ""Anwar and Pakatan Rakyat are realistic enough to know that if they try to change the foundation of the state then the Malays won't vote for them. They will fine-tune the system so that the system reflects more on need rather than race,"" Chin said. What's important to voters, says BERSIH's Chin, is whether the election is perceived to be free and fair. ""It's not just the results, people are judging them on whether there is going to be any fair play,"" she said. ""If there is none, people will be very angry. I'm not sure what the people will decide to do -- it is really up to the people to take charge."" A poll released by the University of Malaya Centre of Democracy and Election last week suggested that more than 60% of voters surveyed favored Pakatan Rakyat. However, the government dismissed the poll and said its own survey showed it was out in front, according to local news websites. Chin of Monash University said voters' response to a potential Barisan Nasional victory will depend on how many of the 222 federal seats it can win. ""If Najib gets within the range of 140 to 150 (seats) people will just give him the benefit of the doubt. But if he goes above 180 they will be demonstrating in the streets. The population will not accept that he has a majority,"" he said. From egg-throwing to bombs . The rate and severity of election-related attacks escalated since parliament was dissolved on April 3. On Thursday, Human Rights Watch urged both coalition parties to ""rein in their supporters,"" who it said had graduated from egg-throwing and paint-smearing to physical assaults and bomb attacks. And along with the violence, the group said that cyberattacks had been directed at a number of Malaysian news websites, restricting access to reporting on the election within the country. ""Ensuring everyone can access information without interference is critical if there is to be a level political playing field in Malaysia,"" said Phil Robertson from Human Rights Watch. ""The government has a duty to investigate and shut down all cyberattacks, interference with ISPs, and hacking so that freedom of expression and the right to receive information is preserved."" Foreign investors were anxious about the election outcome because despite concerns about Malaysia's gaping fiscal deficit, the country's economy has performed relatively well amid the global slowdown. The World Bank expects Malaysia's GDP to grow 5% this year, boosted by capital projects and domestic spending, as citizens make use of civil servant wage increases and government handouts.","NEW: Ruling coalition returned to power, results show .

"(CNN) -- History is against Kevin Krigger. A black jockey hasn't won America's most prestigious race -- the Kentucky Derby -- for over a century. But in Krigger's mind, history has already been rewritten -- we just don't know it yet. ""I know I'm going to win. Why? Because I'm riding Goldencents,"" he told CNN in his lilting Caribbean accent. ""I couldn't be this confident on any other horse."" The bookmakers appear equally assured, placing Krigger as the second favorite to win the $2 million ""Run for the Roses"" -- so called for its iconic blanket of ruby-coloured flowers draped over the winner. Kentucky is the first race of the U.S. Triple Crown series -- followed by the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. But for many, the Derby -- run on Churchill Downs' historic dirt track -- is also a fabulous festivity, capturing the public's imagination in a way few horse races can. History repeats? If Krigger's prediction is right, he'll be the first black jockey to win the premier race since Jimmy Winkfield took the trophy back-to-back in 1901 and 1902. Today, look out across any U.S. race track and you'll likely see an ocean of white -- and increasingly Latin American -- jockeys at the helm. But turn back the clock 150 years and African Americans ruled the field -- when the Kentucky Derby first launched in 1875, 13 of the 15 jockeys were black. Much like the NBA today, black athletes dominated horse racing for the next three decades, winning 15 of the first 28 Derbies. ""They were the premier horsemen in the world,"" says Joe Drape, author of ""Black Maestro,"" which tells the story of champion jockey Winkfield. ""It was the first professional sport for black athletes in America. They were at the forefront of horse racing and it was a place where they could earn a good living."" But the rise of Jim Crow laws in the late 1880s -- segregating blacks and whites -- spelled an end to the golden era of jockeys like Winkfield. Listen: Derby's forgotten history is rekindled . They would later be replaced by successive waves of plucky immigrants ready to try their luck on the track -- from the Irish to Latin American riders today. In 2013, Krigger is one of 50 black jockeys competing in the U.S. -- out of an estimated 1,000. So could the 29-year-old from the Virgin Islands be the one to return the trophy the original godfathers of racing? ""If someone is going to be the first African American in 111 years to do it, then why not me?"" he said. Childhood dreams . The same thought ran through Krigger's mind as a youngster watching the Derby on TV, from his home on the island of St Croix. Horses were a part of life for the rural community, and as a four-year-old Krigger would pull the animals next to cars so he could clamber on board. At 10-years-old he was given his first mare, challenging other children to races on the beach and down dirt roads. Horse-mad Krigger would even balance his saddle on the arm of the sofa and pretend to ride it. ""I was born riding horses -- walking came second,"" he said. ""I watched the Derby every year and I knew that one day I would ride in it. It was always my dream."" Moving on up . At 17, he headed to the U.S. to follow that dream, competing across the country with some success, though failing to crack into the top-ranked competitions. His time would come a decade later. In 2011 Krigger finally found his stride, winning 124 races and notching up $2.8 million in prize money. The racing world took notice -- Krigger got a call from famous Los Angeles agent Tom Knust with an offer to compete at some of the top southern California circuits. He needn't have asked twice. Krigger packed up his family of four children and long-term girlfriend, and moved them from Seattle to a hotel, and then a trailer, before settling into a rented house. He came under the tutelage of reigning Kentucky Derby winning trainer, Doug O'Neil, with a chance to ride the horse of his dreams -- Goldencents. It's little wonder Krigger is feeling confident about this Saturday's derby -- the pair has won four of their six races together. Expectation and dedication . Since winning the Santa Anita Derby last month -- the first black jockey in the 78-year history of the race to do so -- hype has been building around the possibility Krigger could make a repeat performance at Kentucky. California's Santa Anita Derby is seen as an important precursor to Kentucky, with seven of its winners going on to take the ""Run for the Roses."" But despite the enormous expectation, Krigger remains cool as ice: ""Every one of my races I approach the same way -- at the end of the day, it's just another race."" He's trained hard to reach this momentous point in his career -- he rises at 5am each morning -- and success will have nothing to do with his skin color. ""I don't think my win is a win for African American jockeys -- every one of us has to earn the respect of our trainers,"" Krigger said. ""The next black jockey isn't going to ride in the Kentucky Derby because of me -- it's going to be down to them.""","America's most prestigious horse race -- the Kentucky Derby -- is run Saturday .

"(CNN) -- German football is riding the crest of a triumphant wave with two Bundesliga teams in the Champions League final and the national side one of the favorites for the 2014 World Cup. In contrast, no clubs from the English Premier League -- the world's richest -- made it past the last 16 knockout stage and the English national side continues to under perform at the highest level. Owen Hargreaves, who played in both the Bundesliga and the English Premier League as well as starring for England at the 2006 World Cup, believes that the English game urgently needs to start investing in young talent, or risk falling even further behind. ""Young players need to play, end of,"" he told CNN. ""There is a real lack of opportunities for young talent in the Premier League and it needs to be addressed."" Born in Canada, but with a Welsh mother and English father, Hargreaves nurtured his talents in the German system with the Bayern youth set-up. He went on to win four Bundesliga titles with the Bavarian giants as well as the Champions League in the 2000-2001 season. But Hargreaves admits that during that time German football, particularly at national level, was itself suffering from a lack of youngsters to replace aging stars. And he pays credit to the German national football association and Bundesliga clubs in coming up with a plan to address that problem. ""They put an emphasis on pushing young players through,"" added Hargreaves. ""You can see the result, the Bundesliga improved, the national team improved and it's a lesson for the English Premier League."" The Bayern Munich squad which so comprehensively demolished Barcelona 7-0 on aggregate in the Champions League is packed full of their youth academy protegees. Thomas Mueller, who headed the final goal of the tie, exciting 20-year-old David Alaba, rampaging full-back Philipp Lahm, midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger and Toni Kroos, all came through that route. Defender Holger Badstuber, injured earlier this year, is also a first-team regular who started his career in the academy. Borussia Dortmund, who stand between Bayern and a fifth Champions League crown, have also invested heavily in young players under the inspirational leadership of coach Juergen Klopp. ""He's done an incredible job,"" said Hargreaves. The two jewels in their crown are acknowledged to be midfielder Mario Goetze -- who will move to Bayern at the end of the season -- and forward Marco Reus, both products of their academy set-up and tipped for stardom at international level. Defender Mats Hummels ironically learned his trade with Bayern before switching to Dortmund to get regular first-team action. They have all played a prominent role in thrilling successive victories over Spanish clubs Malaga and then Real Madrid in the semifinal to reach the Wembley showpiece on May 25. Hargreaves is full of admiration for the ethos of style of play of the two German finalists. ""They combine Germany efficiency now with flair,"" he said. ""They are mirror images of each other and both thoroughly deserve to reach the final."" Hargreaves moved to Manchester United and was an integral part of the 2007-08 side which won the Premier League title and Champions League, but injuries blighted his career after that double triumph and he was forced to retire at the end of last season aged 32. During his spell in the English Premier League, which ended at big money Manchester City, he saw at first hand the trend towards clubs using ever more foreign imports to supplement their ranks. He acknowledges that with the big money on offer, the stakes are high. ""Maybe clubs are frightened to give home grown talent a chance,"" he said. England manager Roy Hodgson has also seen the danger signs as his side make hard work of qualifying for next year's World Cup in Brazil. ""Quite a few of the games I go to do not have any English players,"" he was quoted as telling the Daily Telegraph. ""So, one has to be very careful these days when talking about the Premier League and talking about the Englishness of it, because more than two thirds of the players in the league are not English. ""We have one of the lowest number of home-grown players to choose from in all the leagues, which, if you are national team manager, is not a great advantage, to be frank."" In the Bundesliga, the figures for German talent getting a regular game are the polar opposite to the English Premier League, with participation at well over 60% and it's the same percentage in Spain, the reigning World Cup and European champions. Barcelona's famed La Masia academy nurtured the genius of Argentina's Lionel Messi and midfield maestros Xavi and Andres Iniesta, who have been the corner stone of Spain's international success. On the evidence of the 7-0 semifinal mauling by a rampant Bayern, Barca may need to replenish their ranks with younger talent, with Thiago Alcantara and Cristian Tello pushing to graduate to regular first team play. In England, there are signs that the principles Hargreaves and so many others espouse may finally be incorporated into the national game. The Premier League has introduced rules that mean eight of the 25-man squads must be ""home grown"" talent, limiting the number of foreign players over 21 to a maximum of 17. The Premier League also has high hopes for its Elite Player Performance Plan, which is designed to increase the number of home grown players playing football at the highest level. While this does not mean the English youngsters will get a starting place, it does broaden opportunity and the English Football Association (FA) has also built a new National Center of Excellence in St George's Park in the Midlands. For Hargreaves it cannot come a moment too soon and his former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville, now an assistant coach to Hodgson, has also seen the danger signs. ""There's a tipping point and I think we've gone beyond it in England. We're maybe 20 per cent off. We need to give more chances to our own. We're harming ourselves a little bit."" he was quoted recently. Prime target . Ironically, the rising star of the Premier League is a Welshman, Gareth Bale, who won the young player and player of the year awards for his incredible performances this season for Tottenham Hotspur. Bale was developed by Southampton's academy, which also produced Arsenal and England striker Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain -- proof that young talent can thrive in Premier League if given a chance. Hodgson and Neville must be ruing the fact they cannot pair former teammates Bale, Walcott and Oxlade-Chamberlain in the England line-up, while Tottenham will be anxious their star asset remains at White Hart Lane. After Barcelona and Real Madrid's maulings at the hands of the all-conquering German sides they are rumored to be looking to supplement their own home grown Spanish stars with big money signings and Bale is reportedly a prime target. Bayern, with former Barca coach Pep Guardiola taking over from Jupp Heynckes next season, are also not adverse to using their financial muscle as well. Dortmund's talisman Goetze is switching to the Allianz Arena next season -- making it even harder for sides from the EPL and other major European leagues to challenge a likely new era of German domination.","Owen Hargreaves says English football need to give young players opportunities .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese authorities Monday arrested dozens of demonstrators in Hohhot as protests spread to the provincial capital and other cities in Inner Mongolia despite tightened security and reports of martial law, activists told CNN. ""Several hundred people, mostly students and ordinary Hohhot residents, gathered at Xinhua Square around 11 a.m. Monday, chanting slogans and holding signs demanding legal rights for the Mongolia people,"" said Enghebatu Togochog, director of the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center. ""Paramilitary troops dispersed the crowd after an hour and dozens were arrested."" Sources in the city told him the protest turnout was much smaller than planned, Togochog said, as officials sealed local campuses and shut down social media. He added that, in addition to Hohhot, the government has also deployed paramilitary troops into Tongliao, Chifeng and other cities, putting more areas in Inner Mongolia under de facto martial law. Local officials continue to dispute activists' accounts, even as state-run media reported some conciliatory gestures by the government. ""There was no protest in downtown Hohhot,"" Wen Fei, an official with Inner Mongolia's foreign affairs office, told CNN. ""Everything is normal and there is no martial law."" ""All students are free to move around,"" echoed Ji Shugang, a spokesman for the government of Xilin Gol prefecture. ""Journalists are welcome here, but you need to apply for permission first."" Xilin Gol is the site of one of the largest protests last week, as an estimated 2,000 Mongolian students took to the streets to show solidarity with a Mongolian herder, who was struck and killed by a Chinese coal truck driver. In an unusual move, Inner Mongolia's Communist Party chief visited the Xilin Gol area Friday to meet with students and teachers, the Inner Mongolia Daily reported. Hu Chunhua said authorities had detained the suspects in the herder's death and promised swift punishment to those found responsible, according to the newspaper. The government has also sacked a top local official and pledged to better manage the mining industry to reduce its impact on herders' livelihood. The Beijing-based Global Times, a mass-circulating tabloid, ran an editorial Tuesday, calling some demands of ""largely peaceful protesters"" in Inner Mongolia ""reasonable"" while accusing Western media of exaggerating ethnic clashes in the region. Activists acknowledge officials' effort to calm tensions, but doubted their sincerity in resolving the dispute long term. They say the government's push in recent years to expand coal mining in areas traditionally used for grazing has threatened the very existence of Mongolian herders and their culture. ""Officials just temporarily shut down a coal mine where the herder was killed,"" Togochog said. ""Hu Chunhua still stated development must go on, so they won't halt coal mining and production in the area forever."" The grassroots and peaceful nature of the Mongolian demonstrations has made it difficult for authorities to justify a harsh crackdown, he added, noting Beijing's more heavy-handed responses in the past to protests by Tibetans and Uighur Muslims. ""By carrying out this non-violent movement, Mongolians are gaining confidence in people power, in its ability to demand changes,"" he said. The Chinese government has hailed Inner Mongolia as a ""model autonomous region"" with rapid economic growth -- spurred by the mining industry -- and ethnic harmony. With the recent unrest gaining international attention, Beijing is playing down the ethnic dimension. ""Local authorities are trying to balance environmental protection and economic development,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu commented Tuesday on the herder's death. ""Overseas parties who try to use this incident to stir up trouble have ulterior motives."" Mongolians have lived in the area for centuries, but the Han Chinese -- who arrived in large numbers after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 -- now make up almost 80 percent of Inner Mongolia's population.","The protests move to other cities in Inner Mongolia .

"New York (CNN) -- Just about a year ago, Josh Fattal, one of three American hikers imprisoned in Iran on suspicion of espionage, tasted freedom. But the road back from an Iranian jail cell -- where he spent more than two years -- to life in the United States has left the 30-year-old reflecting about what he and fellow hikers Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd had to endure. ""It's been quite a year,"" said Fattal. ""I feel way better than a year ago. That's for sure."" He said it's been difficult to recover from his 781 days of imprisonment in an 8-by-13 foot jail cell. ""I'm feeling really good, but it's not easy to transition,"" he said. ""A lot of people experience trauma, but mine was very prolonged, systematic, enduring trauma and it's hard to come out of that."" In an interview with CNN, Fattal described how he and Bauer used to sit in their cell and wonder what it would be like to be free again. After he was released on September 21, 2011, he said even simple decisions proved daunting. ""We didn't think it would be as hard as it (turned out to) be at all,"" he said. ""Now I have the freedom to turn off the light bulb when I sleep. I have the freedom to sleep with sheets. There's all sorts of freedom to move I didn't have before."" The three Americans were hiking in northern Iraq's mountainous Kurdish region in July 2009 when they were arrested by Iranian border guards, after apparently straying into Iranian territory. Now back in the United States, Fattal on Saturday organized an ""Occupy""-inspired event in Manhattan, celebrating his one year of freedom. Next week, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is to address the United Nations General Assembly. ""They're probably down on 5th Avenue shopping for some capitalist luxuries,"" he said, referring to Ahmadinejad's entourage. ""And so we want him to bring that stuff to the 'Really, Really Free Market,' "" a tongue-in-cheek reference to his anniversary event in New York City's Madison Square Park. Earlier this year, Fattal traveled to Louisville, Kentucky, taking advantage of an invitation to toast Muhammad Ali at his 70th birthday party. The boxing legend had lobbied on the hikers' behalf during their imprisonment. ""I told him how much it uplifted me. I told him how buoyant I was when I read (his) words,"" said Fattal. ""When I read about the press conference that he gave ... I then immediately put down the letter I was reading ... and started shadow boxing in the room."" But the former prisoner also recounted darker times, explaining that the memories of his days and nights spent behind bars still occasionally fill his nightmares. ""We haven't really had a chance to explain all,"" he said, adding that he has plans to publish a tell-all book with his former fellow inmates sometime next year. He declined to offer further details about his imprisonment until the book is published.","Josh Fattal is one of three hikers who were imprisoned in Iran on suspicion of spying .

"(CNN) -- Typhoon Usagi had Hong Kong and China's Pearl River Delta in its predicted path Sunday. At 9 a.m. Sunday (9 p.m. Saturday ET), Usagi was about 242 miles east of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory said. It was expected to move west-northwest at about 11 miles per hour. The U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center said the storm had sustained winds of 115 mph. That was a drop from the 162 mph recorded on Friday, but Chinese authorities were bracing for major effects from landfall expected Sunday or Monday to the east of densely populated Hong Kong. Fujian Province evacuated more than 80,000 people and deployed more than 50,000 disaster-relief personnel, state news agency Xinhua reported. Evacuations also took place in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, state-run news agency Xinhua said. The news agency said some shipping along the coast and between Taiwan and the mainland had been halted. More than 44,000 fishing boats had been ordered into port.

"(CNN) -- CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta was near the scene of a small plane crash Saturday afternoon on the campus of the University of Florida. Maj.

According to Barber, the plane crash-landed into a truck parked adjacent to a field being used by tailgaters before Florida's football game against the University of Arkansas. No one on the ground was hit or injured, and the pilot and passenger -- who emerged from the cockpit under their own power -- were taken to a local hospital with minor injuries, Gupta said.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Allan Yang would be a success story in any country. Originally from China's impoverished interior, he was the first member of his family to leave his native Anhui province and is now pursuing an MBA at the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing. At 24, Yang is the face of new China: erudite, sophisticated and a card-carrying member of the Communist Party. ""It's just like applying for university in the United States,"" he said of the party. ""You give an application letter and submit some reports that test your knowledge of Communist history."" In fact the process is a bit more complicated. Unlike applying to college, a successful application for membership in the Chinese Communist Party typically takes years. Arduous ""observational periods"" are required when prospective members are expected to read the classics of Socialism, become steeped in the party ideology and submit an unending series of essays that are little more than long paeans to the party's greatness. Though Yang admits few take this process seriously. ""There are lots of things to download from the Internet, we just copy and paste,"" he chuckled. Far more serious is the question of China's future, a future that -- for better or worse -- will likely be dominated by the Communist Party and eventually people like Yang. In China today, the party has become an exclusive club for the country's elite. According to the parties own internal statistics, less than 90,000,000 people, or around 7% of China's population, currently form its ranks. The general view of Chinese these days is that recruitment is most heavy among university students and the moneyed population, while most of the worker/peasants that constituted the party's historical support appear no longer welcome. It is an irony not lost on Aaron Zhang. ""When they say, 'I care about China,' my first instinct is not to believe them."" Zhang, a 25-year-old Aeronautical Engineering student at Beihang University in Beijing is not in the party, a fact he noted with more than a sparkle of pride. He claimed that far from fulfilling the party's original mission of lifting up the poor, the modern party has mutated into an oligarchy, and its youngest members are motivated by nothing more than naked careerism. ""For lots of jobs, membership in the party is necessary,"" said Zhang. ""My relatives wanted me to join, they knew it would be good for my career, but I do not believe in Communism, and I just didn't want to lie."" Yang, by contrast, is personally unapologetic. ""90% of my motivation was career,"" he admitted. A number of other students conceded that while career did play a major role in their decision, social responsibility was also a critical element of the party and influenced their desire to join. ""Party members are expected to be better,"" chimed one earnestly. ""It's probably a combination of things,"" said Jonathan Banfill, a lecturer at Tsinghua University's Department of Foreign Languages and Literature. Banfill, who has seen a lot of eager Communists come and go over the years, noted China's long history of scholar-bureaucrats and the traditional respect and job security that came with government service. Today, however, he stressed that young Chinese had no single motive for joining the party. ""Some students want it for idealistic reasons, there are people who want it for a stable job, people who want it for connections and then there are people who join because their mothers told them to,"" he said. The party loomed large for their parents, most of who were born during the Cultural Revolution and came of age amidst the tumult of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. For them the party today is a safe refuge for their children against the economic uncertainties that plague a developing nation. Membership in the party is almost never explicitly required for any job and open discrimination is forbidden under Chinese law, however, for those that want an interview after graduation, the facts on the ground are indisputable. Party membership is almost always a must for any form of government service and is strongly preferred for employment in China's vast state-owned enterprises. According to the Ministry of Education, the country graduated 6.8 million students in 2012, thus ensuring that competition for jobs will be fierce. Despite China's impressive market reforms, their 2012 statistical yearbook calculated that state enterprises employ 67.04 million people, which accounts for 30% of all Chinese economic activity. This amounts to a major institutional disadvantage for China's non-party citizens. A young employee at China Central Television (CCTV), who is not in the party and requested anonymity, admitted he was the exception that proved the rule. He noted that promotion for him would be almost impossible without becoming a party member. It is still too soon to say what these rising Communists will do with the China they inherit. The party's Confucian aversion to youthful leadership ensures that several decades will pass before any of them approach the reins of power -- which might be a good thing. The young Communists I spoke too generally struggled with any ideas for how to improve the country or the party. Several suggested ""reform"" only to be unable (or unwilling) to provide any specific examples. What is certain is that as the 21st century seems increasingly Asian, China's future leaders will leave their mark not just on their own country, but the world.","China's Communist Party has become an exclusive club for the country's elite .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Firefighters and homeowners were anxiously awaiting to learn Saturday whether the emergence of cool ocean breezes and possible rain will weaken a Los Angeles-area wildlfire that has burned 28,000 acres in two days and now threatens 4,000 homes. The weather change could be a mixed blessing, however, because a chance of isolated thunderstorms this weekend brings a risk of lightning sparking new fires, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The Los Angeles area fire, based in Ventura County, has damaged 15 residences and five commercial properties and has destroyed 25 outbuildings, fire authorities said. The inferno, called the Springs Fire, raced about 10 miles beside upscale communities and through the Santa Monica Mountains since it began Thursday morning in Camarillo, California. It reached the Pacific Ocean shore, damaging a Navy shooting range next to coastal wetlands Friday. iReporter captures bird's-eye view of the wildfire . A total of 1,895 fire personnel, six fixed-wing air tankers and 11 helicopters have battled the blaze, but as of Saturday morning, the fire was only 30% contained, an improvement over Thursday's 10% and Friday's 20%. That means 300 commercial properties and 250 outbuildings also are threatened, authorities said Saturday. ""A low pressure weather system has developed over the fire bringing higher humidity, lower temperatures, creating an opportunity to increase containment,"" the state fire agency said. The region's so-called Santa Ana winds -- dubbed ""devil winds"" because they are warm and gusty out of the high desert -- have been fueling the Ventura County wildfire. The virtual absence of recent rain also created dry conditions ripe for the wildfires, whose season typically begins much later in the year. ""Onshore winds have begun to diminish this evening allowing for the expiration of all red flag warnings,"" the National Weather Service said late Friday. The Santa Ana winds gusted to 45 mph the past two days, energizing the roaring flames. Authorities ordered a mandatory evacuation Friday for the affluent Ventura County community of Hidden Valley, northwest of Los Angeles. Evacuations remained in effect Friday evening for several other areas. Share your images . Federal funding was made available to cover 75% of firefighting costs, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Friday. Also on Friday, the Ventura County blaze crossed the scenic Pacific Coast Highway that separates the Santa Monica Mountains from the sea. There, small fires blackened the landscape surrounding a military firing range, a Navy spokeswoman said. Several timber backdrops at the range were partially or completely burned, but because the facility sits in wetlands next to a lagoon, the fires weren't a threat to Naval Base Ventura County at Point Mugu, said spokeswoman Kimberly Gearhart. Ammunition isn't stored at the facility, she said. ""If something catches fire, it's in the best possible place because it's isolated and it's near water,"" Gearhart said. ""Our biggest concern right now is smoke because it's a very smoldering fire, and as the wind shifts, it either blows smoke toward or away from us."" Evacuation orders were in effect in several areas on Saturday, but officials lifted orders for the campus of California State University, Channel Islands in Camarillo and for the Dos Vientos community in Newbury Park, authorities said. Many Ventura County residents, especially those who live in or near the mountains, were on edge about the fires and possible evacuation. ""The sheriff said they would come pounding on the door if they came close,"" said Ventura County resident Elizabeth Dickenson. Because of the smoke, ash and winds, people in affected areas were urged to be cautious and to avoid unnecessary outdoor activities, the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District said. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers described the fire as an omen for California because the wildfire season isn't supposed to start until August or September. Mountain chaparral and shrubs are dry because Los Angeles has received only half of its normal rainfall the past two years, Myers said. The vegetation is brown, instead of green from winter rain, he said. The Los Angeles area has received less than 2 inches of rain since January, making the bone-dry region ""definitely ripe for these fires,"" said William Patzert, a NASA climatologist. But that could change soon. Rain showers could hit the area Sunday evening, forecasters say. CNN's Paul Vercammen, Stephanie Elam, Diahann Reyes, Phil Gast and Lateef Mungin also contributed to this report.","Cool onshore breezes and possible rain could weaken wildfire in Los Angeles .

"(CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama was expected to make headlines in Europe with her style and flair as she accompanied her husband to the Group of 20 summit, but it was a simple gesture that has set off a media frenzy. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and first lady Michelle Obama embrace while meeting Wednesday in London. While meeting Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in London on Wednesday, the two women briefly embraced -- not your typical scene at Buckingham Palace. The British media called it everything from a breach of protocol to an extraordinary show of affection from the queen. The Times of London proclaimed it a ""touching moment,"" and the palace apparently agreed. ""This was a mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation between the queen and Michelle Obama,"" a palace spokeswoman said. CNN's Carol Costello talked about the moment Thursday with Charles Mosley, author of ""Blood Royal,"" on CNN's ""American Morning."" CNN: According to our tabloids in the United States, the meeting went really well. What's your take? Mosley: Absolutely. What is astounding is the picture of the queen with her arm around Michelle Obama and Michelle Obama's hand around the queen, too. But the queen made the first move. This is the most astounding thing because the queen is not known for being touchy-feely. Indeed, her son Prince Charles complained on one occasion that he wasn't given enough affection when he was a child. She's obviously a late developer. CNN: What's the big deal [about touching the queen]? Mosley: The big deal is that the queen is normally a sacred person. In monarchies, there's a sacredness that surrounds the sovereign, which is perhaps not known in republics, at least not all the time in the way that it is in a monarchy. She's been on the throne a very, very long time, and she is herself a very dignified person, all the more so because of her relatively short stature. Watch to see if ""hugging"" the queen broke protocol » . One of the things one saw yesterday was the way [President] Obama and Michelle towered over the queen and indeed Prince Philip. CNN: By the queen putting her hand on the small of Michelle Obama's back, does that signal friendship? The queen said something to Michelle Obama toward the end of the meeting about keeping in touch. Mosley: Certainly, keeping in touch is meant quite literally. Yes, it's a very significant gesture; she's not known for this kind of thing. amFIX: Your thoughts on Michelle Obama and the queen . CNN: Let's talk about the other gesture: the gift of the iPod. Some tabloids are calling it the ""i-Dud"" in the sense that this wasn't a great present to give the queen. What do you think? Mosley: Not a bad one at all. The queen is actually quite technologically advanced. She uses e-mail to a much greater extent than most members of the royal family and particularly much more than her son, who is a bit of a technophobe. CNN: [The queen gave the president a silver-framed photograph of herself and her husband.] Was it a recent picture of the queen and Prince Philip at least? Mosley: That I don't know. If it's the same as she gives everybody, it must be a sort of middle period picture because it would have to cover so many years. On the other hand, it may well be that this gesture of terrific friendship and affection for Michelle Obama was her way of saying, ""Sorry, I should have given you something more personal.""","First lady Michelle Obama and Britain's Queen Elizabeth II briefly embrace .

"(CNN) -- The close-knit community of backcountry skiing was in mourning Monday, a day after an avalanche in Washington state killed a prominent judge in the extreme sport plus two other experienced skiers. The avalanche occurred Sunday in the Cascade Mountains about three miles west of the Stevens Pass ski area, said John Gifford, general manager of that resort. The dead included Stevens Pass marketing director Chris Rudolph, who was described on the ski area's website as ""a man of endless charisma and charm, whose vision and dedication to Stevens Pass helped shape the mountain we all love today."" Another victim was John Brenan, whom the website called ""an enthusiastic Leavenworth local, events host and former ski patroller."" The third man killed was Jim Jack, head judge of the Subaru Freeskiing World Tour. With events from Chile to Canada, that competitive circuit bills itself on its website as the ""longest running and most prestigious competitive big mountain skiing tour in the world."" According to that organization's Facebook page, there was a 4 p.m. MT (6 p.m. ET) memorial Monday at the Snowbird ski area in Utah to honor Jack, who was called ""our brother and (an) amazing freeskiing spirit,"" and the two other victims. More than 100 people attended the event, according to the Seattle Times. ""This is unreal,"" wrote one commenter. ""Jim Jack, you will be so missed."" The three were among a group of about 12 skiers that included staffers from ESPN and Powder magazine, which both offered accounts of the incident. The designated out-of-bounds area they were all in was not closed, and they were allowed to be there, said Deputy Chris Bedker of the King County Sheriff's Office. ""Nature happened,"" added Katie Larson, also from the sheriff's office, noting that those in the group were experienced and had the required equipment. John Stifler, Powder magazine's senior editor, said that Jack -- the seventh skiier to head down the slope -- triggered the avalanche. The barreling snow rapidly enveloped Jack, Brenan, Rudolph and professional skier Elyse Saugstad. Saugstad told The Seattle Times on Sunday that she recalled hearing someone yell ""Avalanche!"" ""The next thing I knew, I was taking more than a 2,000-foot ride down an avalanche, tumbling and turning and tossing the entire way,"" she told the newspaper. On her website, Saugstad said that she ended up being buried partially and survived ""on account of the inflation of my ABS Avalanche Airbag Backpack."" That device allowed her to keep her head and arms above the snow. After the avalanche hit, ""almost all"" the skiers were ""buried in snow,"" said Larson of the King County Sheriff's Office. Those who could dug themselves out and then located Brenan, Jack and Rudolph. ""They (began) CPR and, unfortunately, were not able to resuscitate the victims,"" Larson said. On the same day and about 25 miles away, Karl Milanoski, 41, was traversing an area he'd ""skied many times"" when fresh snow ""collapsed to what was a cliff and Karl fell between 500 to 1,000 feet to his death,"" according to a website set up to raise memorial funds for his family. Milanoski, who is survived by a 10-year-old daughter, was ""an expert skier and snowboarder (who was) always very cautious,"" according to the website. A posting on the Facebook page of Alpental, a backcountry skiing area affiliated with the Summit at Snoqualmie around where this avalanche reportedly occurred, said, ""Our thoughts and prayers to all the families and friends of those lost in the mountains today. A tough day for the mountain community!"" Backcountry skiing draws people looking for ""better turns (and) less people,"" said Michelle ""Meesh"" Hytner, who was not part of the Washington group and who recently survived a avalanche in Colorado. Hytner expressed fears that the risks -- at least this year -- may outweigh the rewards. ""There are a lot of reasons to go out of bounds, but ... I don't want anything else to happen to anybody,"" she told CNN. ""It's just so sad."" CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NEW: A fourth man died in an avalanche elsewhere in Washington, his family says .

"(CNN) -- For foreign executives, doing business for the first time in India can be a bewildering experience. There's the new -- different business customs, bureaucracy and the dizzying scale of the population -- but also the familiar. ""You'll likely be dealing with people who speak the Queen's English, and who graduated from top Western universities,"" said Jitendra Singh, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. ""You can get lulled into a false sense of security -- ""but for people dressing a little different and talking a little different, they are just like me,'"" he said. ""That's a completely false premise. There are all kinds of nuances in the culture, implicit cultural norms that we don't know about until we run afoul of them."" As the world's second most populous nation, with more than one billion people, India is projected to become one of its biggest economies. It is tipped by PricewaterhouseCoopers to nearly draw level with the United States by 2050. ""For companies with any kind of global interest, the writing is on the wall that they need to have a strategy for India,"" said Singh. Read more: Doing business in China . But Singh said that for Western companies rushing to enter the Indian marketplace, it needs to be recognized that the country is a very different proposition -- both in terms of business practices and consumer preferences -- and must be treated accordingly. ""One of the common pitfalls in addressing the Indian marketplace is simply dusting off something you might offer in your home market,"" he said. ""Indian consumers are very different -- enormously value conscious and very, very finicky."" Holding to too high a price point could be fatal for foreign businesses, as Indian consumers have less capacity to pay than Western consumers. But by making their products affordable to the mass market, businesses put them within reach of hundreds of millions of potential consumers. The companies that fare best in the Indian market are those that customize their products to the particular preferences of Indian consumers, according to Singh. A case in point was the success of Korean auto manufacturers, he said. ""In the West, it's almost unheard of to have a driver, "" said Singh. ""But in India, labor markets being what they are, you can get a full time driver for a relatively modest wage, and even with a small car, you may want a chauffeur. This will clearly have ramifications for the design of the car -- the customer wants more space in the back."" Business practices are also different in India, and many foreign businesses underestimate the bureaucratic hurdles they will encounter, according to Pawan Budhwar, associate Dean of Research at Aston Business School and co-author of ""Doing Business in India: Building Research-Based Practice."" The secret, he said, was to factor in a realistic amount of time for delays. ""If the website of the ministry says it will take 13 weeks to get the required certificate, it's not realistic it will take 13 weeks,"" he said. Budhwar said that often the reason for the bottlenecks was bureaucrats expecting a pay off. ""That's why they're delaying things, although no one will say this out loud,"" he said. ""If you have a local player, they can perhaps better handle local dynamics like this."" Budhwar said that within ""modern sectors"" such as IT, software and pharmaceuticals, and developed business enclaves such as those in Gurgaon, Pune and Hyderabad, levels of professionalism were often in line with international business expectations. ""People will stick to meeting times, deadlines, promises; they will mean business,"" he said. But he added that dealing with the public sector and trade unions could be a different story. Read more: Is your boss a psychopath? Singh said another area where foreign executives could encounter turbulence was in failing to appreciate the relationship-based focus of Indian business. ""The U.S. is a much more transaction-oriented society, "" he said. ""When you're doing business, you're there to talk about a particular transaction, and you either do it or you don't. But Indian business is still very much relationship-based. Sometimes being too transaction-oriented can be not a smart way to go."" Singh's advice? ""Do a lot of homework and figure out who might be the right people to deal with. There's a very tight network at the top of Indian business, and you need to get access to that network in order to succeed. Finding the right partners can be key, but you need to be diligent."" Budhwar said the key to succeeding in India was to be prepared by tapping into the networks and resources that can provide information on the subject, thereby going in with realistic expectations. ""Have persistence, and don't give up,"" he said. ""The mileage to get into India is great. Don't expect it to be a smooth ride, expect it to be irritating. But once you're there, you'll enjoy it -- and you'll make a lot of money as well.""","India is projected to become one of the world's biggest economies in coming decades .
Experts say its business practices are very different from the West .

"(CNN) -- A British tourist in the United States for his 41st wedding anniversary was killed in the crash of a vintage World War II-era plane in the waters off of Galveston, Texas, authorities said Thursday. John Stephen Busby, 66, was visiting the area with his wife, police said. The pilot, identified as Keith Hibbett, 51, of Shady Shores, Texas, was also killed in Wednesday's crash. The P-51 Mustang was owned by the Lone Star Flight Museum in Galveston. Known in recent years as the ""Galveston Gal,"" the plane was used to give rides. Busby was a paying customer, said Sgt. John Sampa of the Texas Highway Patrol. The crash between Chocolate Bay and Galveston Bay was reported to the Coast Guard by the captain of a charter fishing boat shortly before noon. A Coast Guard-led search found the plane in about three to five feet of water in an area known as West Bay. Both occupants were dead, officials said. Federal Aviation Administration records show the plane was built in 1944. According to the museum's website, it was converted to a two-seat, dual-control training aircraft while serving in the El Salvadoran Air Force in the 1960s. In recent years, it was painted with the ""Galveston Gal"" markings and was used to give people a flight experience for about $2,000 a flight. The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation. In 2011, a highly-modified P-51 Mustang crashed into a group of spectators at the Reno Air Races in Nevada, killing the pilot and 10 others, and injuring more than 60 people.

"(CNN) -- A New York University student spent nearly two days trapped in a narrow shaft between two buildings in lower Manhattan, a Fire Department of New York spokesman said Monday. The student, 19-year-old sophomore Asher Vongtau, is in fair condition after being rescued Sunday evening from the tight space between an NYU residence hall at 80 Lafayette St. and a garage, a spokeswoman for Bellevue Hospital Center said. The teen's mom, Habiba Vongtau told CNN affiliate WABC that her son ""really can't remember"" how he became trapped. He has ""broken bones, arm and contusions"" and a possibly fractured pelvis, Habiba Vongtau said. A public safety sergeant discovered the student wedged into the space when he heard moaning, John Beckman, a university spokesman, told CNN. The Fire Department quickly responded to an emergency call at 5:07 p.m. Sunday. It took almost 90 minutes to free the student, a Fire Department spokesman said. Firefighters used pneumatic tools to break through three layers of cinder block. ""Our understanding is that the student was conscious and able to communicate with rescuers throughout the rescue,"" Beckman said. University officials first received word of a missing student early Sunday. Later that day, some of his possessions were found at Lafayette Hall, a dormitory. It is unclear how the student got stuck in the space. ""We are very glad to say that at least that student was found safe, and mostly sound, and was rescued,"" Beckman said. He is being treated at Bellevue Hospital Center. The student's father, Lulufa Vongtau, says his son is studying political science at NYU. He grew up in Nigeria and moved to the United States with his mother in 2007. His mother traveled from Pittsburgh on Sunday night after news of her son's accident. His father is in Nigeria and trying to make arrangements to get to New York. CNN's Morgan Winsor contributed to this report.","NEW: Student doesn't remember how he became trapped, his mother says .

"(CNN) -- Barnes & Noble is still making digital products, and E-Ink readers are here to stay. File these two facts in your ""things that may surprise you"" folder. The book retailer confirmed the first fact on Wednesday by introducing a completely redesigned Nook GlowLight e-reader. The new ultra-light E-Ink-based product arrived just weeks after Amazon introduced its newest Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, confirming the second fact. Purpose-built devices such as the GlowLight and Paperwhite clearly have a place in the tablet world, and while neither Barnes & Noble nor Amazon divulge its e-reader sales, it's clear that both companies are fully committed to the category, and customers are still buying them. A new-look Nook . In fact, not only are the two retailers committed, they continue to innovate. Like the Paperwhite before it, Barnes & Nobles' new e-reader features an updated 6-inch E-Ink display with 62% more pixels on the screen than the previous Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight; this improves text clarity and contrast. Barnes & Noble also improved the e-reader's LED-based light source to make light coverage more uniform over the page. While Amazon puts the light source just below the bottom edge of the screen, those on the GlowLight were clearly visibly from just above the top edge. Overall, I'd say the GlowLight screen looks quite good; the contrast and lighting is comparable to what you'd find on a Paperwhite. With the exception of its shape, Barnes & Noble's new GlowLight looks almost nothing like its predecessor. The original Simple Touch with GlowLight is black and gray, and includes a power/sleep button on the back. The updated e-reader is mostly white and off-white, and has a subtly curved soft-touch back, as well as a wraparound silicon edge. The most remarkable change, though, is its weight. The GlowLight weighs just 6.2 ounces; that makes it more than an ounce lighter than the Paperwhite â€” and it's a noticeable difference. Barnes & Noble worked on the software to reduce page-turn flashes to zero within books, and cut down on ghosting. This held up during a brief demonstration, but we'll have to wait for a review unit to see if if the e-reader's performance remains consistent. What's more, the company worked with Monotype to create four new fonts, including Avenir Sans and Tipperary; they looked quite sharp onscreen. Storage space has now doubled to 4GB for the $119 model. Amazon's Paperwhite also costs $119 (as long as you accept sleep-state ads), but comes with just 2GB. Of course, books don't eat up a lot of space. The GlowLight can accommodate roughly 2,000 books, while the Paperwhite can hold roughly 1,100 books. Barnes & Noble is also trying to bring the retail experience to its Nook devices. Last year, the company introduced curated shopping options on its Nook tablets; that experience has been recreated on the GlowLight in its Now on Nook section. According to Doug Carlson, Barnes & Noble's executive vice-president of digital content and marketing, their customers already rely on the retailer's 40,000 booksellers at its 14,000 locations for in-person buying advice. The curated recommendations on the GlowLight come from those same booksellers. ""They've taken it as an opportunity to get more avant-garde and unique in thinking and approach,"" Carlson said. Despite its reduced size and improved light and page-turn performance, the GlowLight's battery life is still rated at eight weeks. Your mileage may vary depending on how long you use the light and how often you access Wi-Fi to buy books through the device. Barnes & Noble started selling the new GlowLight on Wednesday. The company will continue to sell the Nook Simple Touch e-reader for $79. Barnes & Noble's future . Despite making some great products, Barnes & Noble has struggled to compete in the tablet space. There have been corporate shuffles. Carlson, whose background is in digital publishing (Zinio) and water (Fiji), joined the company in September. When I asked about Barnes & Noble's survival and commitment to digital hardware, he kept smiling, but answered firmly: ""We're here and we're strong."" The company is profitable in its retail and college business, Carlson said, adding that millions of users are moving to digital platforms. ""We're definitely committed to the device business, and you'll see us continue to innovate on all platforms over time. There will be more devices."" © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Carmichael Griffin didn't think anything of it when his face began to swell. He assumed he had just gained a couple of pounds. But when the swelling progressed to severe vomiting and frequent urination, he knew something was wrong. It turned out that both of his kidneys were failing. He was suffering from hypertension, a common ailment among African-American patients. ""My blood pressure had scarred my kidneys so much they were surprised I didn't have a stroke then,"" said Griffin, 32. ""I was a walking time bomb."" That was nearly 12 years ago. The Washington-based music producer and actor has been on dialysis and awaiting a kidney transplant since then. A study published this month by the American Journal of Kidney Diseases shows that African-American patients awaiting a new organ are less likely to get one than non-black patients. At the 275 transplant centers in the United States, African-Americans had at least a 35% lower chance of receiving a live kidney donation, said Dr. Erin Hall of the Department of Surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. At some centers, African-Americans had a 76% lower chance of getting an organ. The study surveyed 247,707 adults registered for first-time kidney transplants from 1995 to 2007. About 92,000 people in the United States are on a waiting list for a kidney transplant. More than one-third are African-Americans, according to the National Kidney Foundation. In 2011, 5,771 living donor transplants were performed, 813 on African-American patients. ""African-Americans had lower odds of obtaining living donor kidney transplantation at every transplant center in the country,"" Hall said. Living donor transplants -- donations of an organ or part of an organ from a live person -- are the best option. A kidney from a living donor usually starts to function immediately. In some cases, a kidney from a deceased donor may require a patient to remain on dialysis until it begins to function. The racial disparity may be attributed to education levels, economic factors or medical characteristics such as blood type, Hall said. Also, some centers may be more focused on deceased kidney transplants, she said. ""There's also a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes [among African-Americans] that would preclude you to become a donor,"" Hall said. Griffin believes there's a lack of support and knowledge about kidney donation among African-Americans. He has asked family and friends for help, but to no avail. ""I am exhausted,"" he said. ""I have a couple of white friends who received transplants and a few black friends whose families donated it to them. Makes me wonder what I'm doing wrong."" He says more education is needed, that potential donors need to know that it's not a life sentence for them. ""Of course living donor kidney transplantation involves not only the recipient of the kidney, but also the donor,"" Hall said. ""It could be the social networks of African-American populations."" Hall advises frustrated African-American patients that it is never too late to take control of their medical care, and to continue to ask. She suggests patients educate themselves more on the process of living organ donation so that they become more comfortable speaking with potential donors. ""If we continue to fight for them, and they continue to fight for themselves, we can reach a good solution,"" Hall said. Griffin has stopped asking family and friends for an organ, but he continues to produce music and act. His hope is that he can one day do those things away from a dialysis machine.","Thousands of patients in the U.S. are in need of a kidney transplant .

"(CNN) -- Indoor cats can reach the ripe old age of 20. With advanced years come health-related issues such as arthritis or diabetes. But a study by the American Pet Products Association notes that feline veterinary visits have declined in recent years. ""Where are all the cats?"" asks Dr. Annie Price of the Ormewood Animal Hospital in Atlanta. ""A lot of times if we can find diseases early, we can really lengthen life expectancy and improve quality of life by addressing the issue early."" A well-cared-for indoor cat can live into its teen years, says Dr. Emmy Pointer, medical coordinator of the ASPCA Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital in New York. Cats that go outside significantly reduce their odds, according to petplace.com, which estimates that most indoor cats can reach 12 to 18 years while outdoor cats only reach 4 to 5. While there is no set rule for when a pet becomes geriatric, Pointer considers cats seniors when they hit the last third of their life, typically around age 12. If your cat has reached its golden years, take note of these common health issues: . MNN.com: 10 wacky pet accessories . Chronic kidney disease . An older cat that consumes lots of water and urinates a lot may be showing signs of kidney disease. Pointer notes that cats with chronic kidney disease also are prone to urinary tract infections. While there is no cure, she says low-protein and low-phosphorous diets can help by giving the kidneys less work to do. Early detection also allows veterinarians to slow the progression of symptoms. Since cats do a better job than dogs when it comes to hiding health problems, your vet may recommend blood work to detect underlying issues. ""I like dealing with elderly cats because there are so many things you can do for them; it's just a matter of being mindful,"" Price says. ""They can seemingly have no clinical signs and look perfectly healthy, and you check blood work and determine early kidney problems or thyroid conditions or changes in liver values."" Also note that health issues may resurface due to an elderly cat's diminishing immune system. For example, cats that seemed to overcome a viral disease years ago may show symptoms, such as increased ocular discharge, later in life. Treatment options may be limited. Pointer recommends discussing the problem with your vet and scheduling a thorough exam. MNN.com: Extra tests to consider for elderly pets . Dental disease . In its annual roundup of the most expensive -- and preventable health conditions -- Bergh Hospital ranked dental disease No. 1. While treatment starts at about $400, regular dental care can significantly reduce that cleaning bill. Good dental hygiene also helps prevent other issues. ""Dental disease can lead to more serious heart and kidney problems,"" Pointer warns. ""The most important thing is it just hurts. Having an abscessed tooth or horrible gingivitis upsets quality of life for a cat."" Regular brushing is the best route, but many cats won't tolerate such torture. Pointer notes that enzymatic chews and a prescription diet with large kibbles can help break off tartar. But home remedies will not eliminate the need for veterinary dental cleaning under anesthesia. ""If the pet has moderate to severe dental disease, there is nothing you can do at home,"" she says. MNN.com: Videos of cats that like water . Arthritis . Cats get arthritis just like dogs, but Price says there are fewer prescription treatment options available because cats metabolize medications at a much slower rate. But that doesn't mean they have to endure pain. Price has found success using fish oil and omega-3 fatty acid supplements as well as companion therapeutic laser treatments, which decrease inflammation and increase blood flow. Pointer notes that acupuncture, glucosamine and chondroitin also have been effective in treating cats with arthritis. ""Arthritis is severely under-diagnosed in cats, which is really sad because the vast majority of older cats have arthritis and only a fraction get treated,"" Price says. ""People think, 'Well it's an older cat, he sleeps, he's OK.' Would you think same about a dog? No."" Obesity . It's no secret that cats are losing their battle of the bulge, just like dogs. While the American Association for Pet Obesity Prevention considers eight to 10 pounds the ideal weight for most domestic cats, a recent study found that 55 percent of the country's cats are considered overweight or obese by their vets. But Pointer says that sudden weight loss can cause liver failure. ""I would never want my client's pets to lose more than a quarter-pound a month, but talk to the vet to discuss this because they may want more,"" Pointer says. She adds that canned food is best for cats because it's primarily protein, while dry kibble is mostly carbohydrates. ""Feeding a carnivore mostly carbs can contribute to weight gain.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A lawyer for Michael Jackson's family seemed satisfied as he left the Los Angeles courthouse after the first week of the pop star's wrongful death trial. ""There's a long way to go and we hope the evidence supports -- and we believe it does -- that Dr. (Conrad) Murray was unfit for the job he was hired to do,"" attorney Brian Panish said. ""He was financially motivated and was in serious financial straits."" Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, contending the concert promoter is liable in the pop icon's death because it hired, retained and/or supervised Murray, the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Murray's fatal treatment of Jackson with the surgical anesthetic the coroner ruled killed him was the result of the doctors' financial desperation and pressure from AEG executives to have Jackson ready for rehearsals for his comeback tour, Jackson lawyers argue. AEG contends it was Jackson who chose and controlled Murray, not its executives. The company had no way of knowing what treatments the doctor was giving the singer, who it said was an expert at keeping his ""deepest, darkest secret"" The trial's first witness was a paramedic who arrived at Jackson's home at 12:26 p.m. on June 25, 2009 to find a man who he initially thought was a hospice patient who had died after a long illness. Jackson lawyers see that description as support for their argument that AEG execs should have realized the frailty of Jackson's health. AEG lawyer concedes: Michael Jackson is dead . The second witness was the Los Angeles Police detective who led the investigation of Jackson's death. Orlando Martinez arrived at court Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday wearing a black cowboy hat, which he said is not part of his uniform as a homicide investigator, but ""the chief tolerates it."" The trial is off until Monday, when the coroner's toxicologist will give scientific testimony about the drugs found in Jackson's body after his autopsy. The doctor who conducted the autopsy will follow on the witness stand. Conrad Murray's big debts . When AEG Live first talked to Murray about working as Michael Jackson's tour doctor, he asked for $5 million for a year. Now we know why. Court records and credit reports showed Murray was at least $1 million in debt, including delinquent taxes, defaulted student loans, unpaid child support and a defaulted mortgage. His Las Vegas home, which had dropped in value by $500,000, was in foreclosure and his medical clinic was being evicted from an office building, according to records introduced as evidence in the trial. Murray's chances of catching up financially became an achievable goal when AEG Live agreed to pay him $150,000 a month. Before that, his monthly expenses totaled $2,700 more than his income, according to one document. Martinez testified that he concluded this was a major incentive for Murray to ""break the rules, bend the rules, to do whatever he needed to do to get paid."" Murray's heavy burden of child support payments was the result of his fathering eight children with seven women. Jackson lawyers contend AEG could have at least run a credit check on Murray before giving him the responsibility of caring for Michael Jackson. It should have been a red flag warning that he would put his paycheck above his Hippocratic Oath. Murray's other lost patient . The Jackson death trial jury broke out into laughter at the oddest time Thursday -- when Panish asked Martinez about another Murray patient who died under his care. Lawyer: 'Ugly stuff' to come out at trial . A Las Vegas man called Los Angeles police to tell them about how he thought Murray's negligence caused his father's death. The man said he didn't file a medical malpractice suit because Nevada law discouraged him. Panish: ""You learned Conrad Murray wasn't sued for malpractice, but he had killed someone else?"" (The jury laughs.) Panish: ""You learned that Dr. Murray had caused the wrongful death of someone else?"" Martinez: ""Yes."" AEG's lawyer brought out a document showing the coroner ruled the man's death was from natural causes -- a heart attack. Martinez also testified that Murray had been suspended from hospitals three times in the decade before Jackson's death. The loss of hospital privileges in one case was because he failed to promptly respond to a phone call when he was on call. The others appeared to be based on failure to follow record keeping procedures. Elvis' ghost haunts Jackson trial . Jackson lawyers will argue that a background check on Murray by AEG executives would have revealed these and served as red flag warnings that he should not be Jackson's tour doctor. AEG lawyer will contend they had no way of knowing. 'One Jackson' policy . Only one of Katherine Jackson's eight sons and daughters can sit with her in court at one time, the judge ruled this week. Unlike in Murray's criminal trial when all of the Jacksons filled a courtroom bench at times, the family will have just two seats throughout the civil trial. The limit was imposed because all of the Jacksons -- with the exception of Marlon -- are on AEG's witness list. AEG lawyers objected when they saw Randy and Rebbie sitting with their mother as the first witnesses testified. There is ""a risk in allowing any of them in the courtroom,"" an AEG lawyer argued. The risk is their own testimony would be influenced by hearing the testimony of others, she said. Panish successfully argued that at least one should be allowed to sit with their 82-year-old mother, who plans to be in court each day -- except for the gruesome medical testimony about her son's autopsy. ""I think Mrs. Jackson should have at least one support person in the court room,"" he said. The Jacksons star power could influence jurors who sit just a few feet away from them in the tiny courtroom. Jackson family intervention . AEG lawyers plan to call Janet, Jermaine, Jackie, Tito, La Toya, Rebbie and Randy Jackson to testify about their failed attempts to intervene with Michael Jackson's drug addiction and their lack of knowledge about what was happening to him. Only brother Marlon Jackson is not on the defense witness list. AEG is trying to show that Jackson was able to deceive even those close to him about his drug use, which helps their argument that executives with the concert promoter could not have known about it. The lawsuit contends that even if the executives didn't know about Murray's dangerous treatments, they should have. Katherine Jackson told investigators that her family ""attempted several interventions and she had spoken to her son about possible problems with drugs herself,"" Martinez testified Thursday. ""He denied having a problem."" An intervention at Jackson's Neverland ranch, organized by sister Janet, failed because ""Michael didn't want to participate,"" Martinez said. Messy bedroom . The Los Angeles mansion where Michael Jackson died was clean and neat, except for Jackson's bedroom, according to Martinez. Jurors saw police photos taken hours after the pop icon's death, showing disorganized closets, cardboard boxes lining the hallway and a general mess throughout. AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam spent several minutes questioning Martinez about the messiness. During the lunch break, the Jacksons' lawyer joked to reporters that Putnam has succeeded in proving Michael Jackson was messy. Back in court, Panish asked the detective: ""Is there anywhere in the penal code that says if you have a messy room that's against the law?"" The jury thought that was funny and laughed. Panish: ""You've come across scenes that had a messy room?"" Martinez: ""Yes."" Panish: ""And that's an indication that someone is not doing well, that their health is bad and they can't clean the room?"" Martinez: ""Yes."" Panish: ""There were moving boxes in the room?"" Martinez: ""Yes."" Panish: ""Did you know he was planning to go to England? Within a week or two he was leaving that residence?"" Martinez: ""Yes."" When Martinez walked into the upstairs master bedroom,, he found the gas fireplace was burning, the television was on and music coming from the CD player. Except for Murray, ""only the chef who can drop off food at the door"" was allowed upstairs, he testified.","Conrad Murray was $1 million in debt when he took the job as Michael Jackson's doctor .

"(CNN) -- ""People should be able to breathe -- to not have to worry about being fired because of their sexual orientation or identity."" That seems like a simple enough request, huh Congress? It's a personal one, too, since it comes from Andre Cooley, a 28-year-old who says he was fired in 2010 because his supervisors at a corrections facility in Mississippi found out he's gay. It's time to ban that discrimination, he told me Monday. ""It's way, way, way past time."" A large majority of Americans agree with him. In fact, a majority of Americans in every state, even conservative Mississippi, support legislation that would ban workplace discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. And that makes perfect sense for exactly one reason: To oppose this legislation, which is called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, is to support the idea that LGBT people can be fired for being themselves. It's a clear matter of right and wrong, fair and unfair. This isn't a Republican or Democrat thing. It's a human thing. Related: Gay people live in 50 Americas . Sure, conservatives will trot out all manner of dated and discriminatory arguments to say the legislation isn't needed or will cause unwanted problems. They'll say, ""This is less about tolerance and equality and more about oppressing the freedoms of others."" When they do so, they'll sound to most Americans -- to the 70% or more of us who support this legislation -- like they're parodying themselves in a ""Daily Show"" segment. Whose freedoms, exactly, are being oppressed if a person can't be fired for being gay? And on what planet is freedom increased if someone can be fired, legally, just because of their sexual orientation or gender identity? We have laws to protect people of different races, religions and disabilities from being fired because of who they are. But no federal legislation for LGBT people. A minority of states have passed laws of their own, but why should it be legal for a lesbian in Utah to receive no workplace protection when, across a state border, she would have it in Colorado? This is an issue the American people have decided on. They know it's good for business, as Apple's CEO argued in The Wall Street Journal. ""We've found that when people feel valued for who they are, they have the comfort and confidence to do the best work of their lives,"" Tim Cook wrote. And they know it undermines who we are as Americans, as President Barack Obama said this week. ""It's offensive. It's wrong. And it needs to stop,"" the president wrote in an op-ed in The Huffington Post, ""because in the United States of America, who you are and who you love should never be a fireable offense."" Related: The county where no one's gay . Seems pretty clear-cut, right? Well, Congress is still having some trouble. Sixty-one senators, including seven Republicans, voted Monday night to bring the bill to the Senate floor for debate. There, it has a good chance of passing. But none of that will matter, really, if the nondiscrimination bill can't get past the House of Representatives. Also on Monday, House Speaker John Boehner reaffirmed his opposition to ENDA. ""The Speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost American jobs, especially small business jobs,"" Boehner's spokesman said, according to The Huffington Post. Nevermind that that argument was undermined by a June Government Accountability Office report that found that not to be true in states that already have nondiscrimination laws. What's scary is that Boehner's opposition to this civil rights legislation could keep it from a vote in the House. Let's hope logic and compassion change his mind. I know that sounds naive, but stranger things have happened. Cooley, for example, the corrections officer in Mississippi, sued and got his job back. He was able to do so because he works for a public employer. Had he worked for a private company, he might not have been so lucky, attorneys and experts who specialize in LGBT employment law told me in March when I first reported on Cooley and his saga. Related: Young and out in Mississippi . He's back at the job he loves. And he's able to be open with his co-workers about who he is now. Maybe that sounds like a small thing. But think of what it's like to live in fear that someone at work will find out your secret and then you'll be out of a job. This is what it's like for gay people in so many states . It was the case for Cooley. Now that Cooley is openly gay at work, and has legal protection because of his court case, he's able to be himself. ""Everything at work is great,"" he told me. It should be that way for others, too. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","John Sutter: Congress should pass Employment Non-Discrimination Act .
ENDA would protect LGBT people from being fired because of who they are .
A majority of Americans in every state support this concept, surveys show .

"(CNN) -- Grammy-winning guitarist Jeff Hanneman, a founding member of the heavy metal band Slayer, died Thursday of liver failure in Southern California, the band said in a statement. He was 49. ""Slayer is devastated to inform that their bandmate and brother, Jeff Hanneman, passed away at about 11 a.m. this morning near his Southern California home. Hanneman was in an area hospital when he suffered liver failure,"" the band said in a statement posted on its website and Facebook page. Hanneman leaves behind his wife, Kathy, a sister and two brothers. ""He ... will be sorely missed,"" the band said. The guitarist was with Slayer from its founding in 1981. Its breakthrough came five years later with the release of ""Reign in Blood,"" an album that included two songs -- ""Angel of Death"" and ""Raining Blood"" -- co-written by Hanneman. That was one of 10 studio albums that the band put out over three decades together, during which they performed thousands of shows. On Slayer's official website, Hanneman said that the last one -- ""World Painted Blood"" -- came together quickly because the band's members worked seamlessly. ""The interaction between all of us on this record was really something special,"" he said. ""... The chemistry was just good."" In 2006 and 2007, Slayer won Grammy awards for best metal performance. The metal world -- in tweets from, among many others, the bands Rancid, Hatebreed, In Flames and Testament -- reacted to Hanneman's death with sadness and appreciation, referring to him as a ""true heavy metal legend"" and a ""brother in thrash."" ""Jeff Hanneman will always be a metal god,"" wrote rocker Andrew WK. ""A true master, he gave energy and excitement to millions, and will continue to. #PartyForSlayer.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Karen Harned has been going to the Supreme Court every day it has met since June 11 so there would be no chance she would miss the health care law ruling. Harned is director of the small business legal center of the National Federation of Independent Business, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that seeks to strike down the law. She and her group have worked through all of the possibilities and are ready to react to the court's ruling immediately. ""We have done a lot of work on that because we think that is critical. We are in the 24-hour media cycle. The reporting will start immediately,"" she told CNN. Ron Pollack of Families USA, one of the major groups promoting the health care initiative, brought activists from a dozen key states to Washington last week to help plan the various messages and reaction plans for each of the possible scenarios depending on how the court rules. ""Over the numerous weeks, we knew different possibilities could occur,"" Pollack told CNN. ""Most of our focus is on what happens if the statute is upheld or partially upheld: where do we go from here and what do we want the public to understand?"" Since Barack Obama took office, no other political issue has generated as much debate, tension and argument than health care reform and the government's role. Various constituencies -- the White House, Congress and a myriad of interest groups on all sides -- anxiously wait for the nation's high court to hand down its decision on one of the most divisive political issues it has taken up in many years. Congress ready for decision -- then it gets tricky . Their task has been complicated by a great deal of uncertainty: How many rulings will there actually be since the justices are considering several different aspects of the Affordable Care Act? Will the court decide to deal with the controversial individual mandate, which requires most citizens to buy health care insurance, separately than the rest of the law? Some interest groups have differing statements ready for seven or eight scenarios. Many of the groups will either be at the court on Thursday or race there so they can go to the cameras staked outside. The big four issues: What the justices are tackling . One coalition of labor and health care reform advocates already sent reporters an e-mail saying they'll hold a conference call at 12:30 p.m. on whatever day the ruling comes with the call-in number. Obama has the most at stake politically because the health care law is considered to be his signature domestic political achievement. A ruling by the court that all or part of the law is unconstitutional would be a black mark on his administration. No president wants to see his signature achievements overturned, said Paul Begala, a former senior adviser in Bill Clinton's White House and now an adviser to the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA as well as a CNN contributor. The White House has steadfastly refused to speculate about what will happen if the law is struck down. However, Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser, said over the weekend at the National Association of Black Journalists convention that the administration is prepared for whatever the court does. She admitted the White House and Democratic congressional allies had been outmaneuvered as the issue was being debated. ""The opponents of it outorganized -- in terms of the 'death panels' -- and distorted what we were doing early on,"" she said, referring to some opponents' assertion that the new law contained a provision that would have bureaucrats decide who would or wouldn't be treated. The Supreme Court health care decision will again put the issue front and center for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who included the individual mandate as part of the health care overhaul he pushed while governor of Massachusetts but has said he does not favor the requirement on a national scale. ""Regardless of what they do, it's going to be up to the next president to either repeal and replace Obamacare or to replace Obamacare. And I intend to do both, if I'm the president at a time when the Supreme Court has left Obamacare in place, I will repeal it on day one by sending out a waiver to all 50 states to keep them from having to pursue Obamacare,"" the presumptive Republican nominee said earlier this month in Orlando, Florida. While Romney would make the states responsible for helping the uninsured, he has said he would make sure to keep some of the more popular provisions of the health care overhaul, such as making sure people aren't dropped from coverage if they have a pre-existing condition. Your Bottom Line: Pre-existing conditions . Romney's campaign staff has been meeting with members of Congress on how they will react, with the Republican National Committee helping to prepare. House Speaker John Boehner said in a memo to House Republicans last week that ""if the court strikes down all or part of the president's health care law, there will be no spiking of the ball."" He said the emphasis will still be on the economy. ""We will not celebrate at a time when millions of our fellow Americans are out of work."" No matter the decision, analysts on both sides predict there will be political repercussions that could have a major effect on both presidential campaigns in trying to motivate their bases. If the court upholds the law, that could fire up Romney's supporters. ""It is odd -- if you lose substantively, you might win politically,"" Begala said. If the mandate or entire bill is ruled unconstitutional, then the president's base could get motivated. ""Democratic activists are very cynical about the Supreme Court,"" Begala added. Overturning the law could take away a strong motivator for Romney, some analysts have noted, but the president would get the political black eye. A health care 'Judas' recounts his conversion . ""It is going to be the gift that keeps giving,"" said one Republican consultant. ""What we are seeing with independent voters they are unhappy, disenchanted with Obama. This would just reinforce that."" The problem for both parties is trying to decipher what exactly the public wants on this complex and emotional issue that affects most Americans. A CNN/ORC International poll conducted last month showed 51% of Americans surveyed oppose the law -- most of them because they think it goes too far but some who feel it doesn't go far enough -- while 43% favor it. However, a recent Pew Research Center poll found a majority would not be happy with any of the possible scenarios that analysts believe are likely to come from the court. When asked if they would be happy or unhappy depending on how the court might rule, 44% said they would be happy if the entire bill is thrown out; 40% would be happy if just the individual mandate alone is discarded; and 39% would be happy if the entire law is upheld. Despite the massive protests and attention paid to the issue, the American people don't really understand what is contained in the law -- a sign the White House has not done a good job of messaging. Some 49% in the Pew survey said they understand the law somewhat well, 31% said they understand it not too well or not well at all and only 18% said they understand it very well. According to analysis by CNN's ad-tracking service Kantar Media/CMAG, those opposing Obamacare outspent proponents by a 3-1 margin -- $235 million to $69 million -- from March 23, 2010, when the law was signed, through June 17. What to know about health care reform . Some Democrats privately acknowledge they have not done a good job of articulating their message. It's one reason that as they prepare for whatever comes out of the court, they are ready to trumpet some of the act's accomplishments so far. Democratic members of Congress have been given small cards touting such facts as: 6.6 million young adults up to age 26 have health insurance through their parents' plan; up to 17 million children with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage; 54 million Americans with private insurance have received one or more free preventive service and 5.1 million seniors saved $3.2 billion on prescription drugs. Conservatives have pounced on the uncertainties of the law as well as government overreach in its opposition. Concerned Women for America, for example, last week went up with a $6 million ad in six key electoral states (Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Virginia and Wisconsin) and national cable with a doctor saying: ""The truth is, we still don't know how much this law will eventually cost. I don't want anything to come between my patients and me -- especially Washington bureaucrats."" As for the insurers, they have been running what they call an aggressive education campaign to try to sell what it calls an ""inextricable link"" between market reforms and the coverage requirement. The insurers' trade group, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), argues that to afford the changes, the companies need a larger insurance pool that comes with the mandate. If not, then consumers could be facing larger premiums. Also in a pre-emptive move, several major insurers, including Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealthcare, have announced they will allow children of their clients to stay on until they are 26 even if the law is thrown out. ""We are ready for whatever the court decides. We will have a lot more when the court announces,"" said AHIP spokesman Robert Zirkelbach. Basics: Health care reform issues .

"(CNN) -- Gills Onions recalled 2,360 pounds of diced red onions because of possible listeria contamination, the California-based company said Saturday. The recalled onions were distributed to retailers in Canada and retailers and distributors in California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Idaho, Texas, Illinois, Michigan, Arkansas, Ohio, Tennessee, New Jersey, Georgia and Florida. The product is beyond its use-by dates -- May 14, 15 and 17 -- and no illnesses and have been reported, the company said. It advised consumers to toss whatever recalled onions they might still have in the trash. Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease. It is rarely found in healthy people. However, it can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea. In extreme cases, listeriosis can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths, as well as serious and sometimes fatal infections, especially in people with poor immune systems. The voluntary recall was initiated after a routine and random test directed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Gills Onions said. The recalled product sold at retail was in a clear, 7-ounce container, while the product sold to distributors was in a clear, 5-pound plastic bag, the company said.","Gills Onions recalls 2,360 pounds of diced red onions .

"(CNN) -- Democrat Terry McAuliffe, buoyed by strong results from voters in Northern Virginia, has defeated Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli in the race for Virginia's governor, CNN projects. While both campaigns took on national issues, such as the partial government shutdown earlier this year and the health care law's flawed rollout, the race was nasty from the outset and devolved into incessant mudslinging and personal attacks. Voters throughout the commonwealth of Virginia were bombarded by negative ads. Libertarian Robert Sarvis, a third-party candidate, has pulled in 7% of the vote with more than 90% of the vote counted. That's a significant chunk when the Republican and Democratic candidates are so close. McAuliffe will succeed Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, who's not running for re-election because Virginia governors cannot serve consecutive terms. What might make results from Virginia -- along with races including a gubernatorial contest in New Jersey, a race for mayor in New York City and a primary battle for a U.S. House seat in Alabama -- most interesting is what they may tell us about 2014 midterms and the 2016 race for the White House. 5 things to know about this year's most important race . Democrat Bill de Blasio has defeated Republican nominee Joe Lhota in the race for mayor of New York City, CNN projects, making the public advocate the first Democrat to lead the nation's largest city in 20 years. After de Blasio won the Democratic nomination in a crowded and circus-like field earlier this year, the liberal Democrat's victory in the general election was never in question. All polls going into the election had de Blasio defeating Lhota in a landslide, with one released Monday indicating de Blasio was ahead of Lhota with likely voters by more than 40%. Earlier Tuesday night, in another long-predicted result, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie won four more years leading the Garden State by defeating Democratic state Sen. Barbara Buono in the state's gubernatorial race. Christie's victory became a forgone conclusion long before polls closed in New Jersey, as public opinion polls for months have indicated the tough-talking Republican headliner was far ahead of his Democratic challenger. There are national implications to the race, too. With Christie considering a run for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, his re-election campaign is seen as a tuneup or stepping stone for that likely White House bid. According to CNN exit polls of New Jersey voters, Christie performed well with groups that normally cast ballots for Democrats. Early exit polls indicate the GOP governor grabbing 56% of the female vote, and winning all age groups other than those 18-29. Christie also took a fifth of the African-American vote and 45% of Latinos, a much better performance than most Republicans in recent elections. Virginia and New Jersey are the only two states that hold elections for governor in the year after a presidential contest. And as a more moderate Republican won in New Jersey and a conservative Republican lost in Virginia, the establishment candidate defeated the tea party candidate in a Republican primary runoff for a congressional seat from Alabama's 1st district. Bradley Byrne, a former state senator, defeated businessman Dean Young in the race, according to CNN projections. The contest was seen as a precursor to more intraparty fights ahead in primary elections for the 2014 midterms and was the first time Republican voters could weigh in on which direction they want to take their party after the partial federal government shutdown in October. Here's a closer look at some of the night's most interesting races and ballot measures: . A nasty race in purple Virginia . The McAuliffe and Cuccinelli campaigns engaged in nasty political warfare that took over the airwaves in Virginia. McAuliffe made sure women were aware of Cuccinelli's support of ""personhood"" legislation that critics say restricts abortion and some forms of birth control, while Cuccinelli frequently highlighted federal investigations of an electric car company that McAuliffe co-founded. Both sides also attempted to frame the race as a referendum on larger national issues. Cuccinelli's supporters argued a vote against McAuliffe was a vote against Obamacare. McAuliffe and Democrats pinned Cuccinelli as a tea party activist, linking him to conservative lawmakers in Washington who initiated a strategy that eventually led to last month's government shutdown. Democrat Terry McAuliffe wins Virginia governor's race, CNN projects . What Christie's 2013 re-election bid tells us about 2016 . Christie performed well with groups that normally cast ballots for Democrats. Early exit polls indicate the GOP governor grabbing 55% of the female vote, and winning all age groups other than those 18 to 29. Christie also took one fifth of the African-American vote and half of the Latino vote, a much better performance than most Republicans in recent elections. What Christie's victory means for the next presidential race . NYC picks first Democratic mayor in a generation . At the center of the race were disagreements over taxes and the city's controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" program backed by incumbent Mayor Michael Bloomberg. De Blasio campaigned on a promise to raise taxes on those earning more than $500,000 a year to pay for universal prekindergarten, an idea Lhota vehemently opposed. While Lhota painted himself as a fiscal conservative, he sought distance from national Republicans on social issues by reiterating his support of abortion rights and same-sex marriage. De Blasio expected to win NYC mayoral race . Deep-pocketed Republicans pick winner in Alabama . Byrne, the establishment candidate, far outraised Young, the tea party candidate, thanks to major help from the business wing of the party, including the Chamber of Commerce. He also garnered endorsements from establishment figures, including several Republican House leaders. In total, Byrne has raised nearly $700,000, with substantial donations from business community political action groups and individual business donors. Young, on the other hand, has raised $260,000 and has received donations from a political action committee run by former Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle, a darling of the tea party movement, as well as endorsements from conservative talk show hosts Mark Levin and Erick Erickson. However, despite that support for smaller tea party personalities, Young was largely ignored by the national tea party groups. Tea Party Express, Club For Growth and FreedomWorks -- three of the largest national tea party groups -- sat on the sidelines of the intra-party fight. Establishment beats tea party in Alabama runoff . Also on the ballot . New York is not the only major city holding a mayoral contest on Tuesday. Voters in Boston, Seattle, Detroit and Cleveland are also electing mayors. And voters in six states will be weighing in on 31 ballot measures. Among the most interesting: genetically modified food labeling in Washington state, a proposed special marijuana tax in Colorado, secession in 11 Colorado counties and a push to raise New Jersey's minimum wage to $8.25 per hour.

"(CNN) -- Time magazine's recent cover story featuring Jamie Lynne Grumet breastfeeding her almost four-year-old son raised a firestorm about different styles of parenting. Along with the headline -- ""Are you mom enough?"" -- the piece makes every mother question whether she should practice attachment parenting and in the process, embrace all things natural. Wear your baby! Make your own baby food! Breastfeed! Sleep with your baby! Give birth at home -- and don't use painkillers! Like the white, radiant and married woman on Time's cover, many mothers who embrace natural mothering are likely to be educated, middle class, married, fit and savvy. They take motherhood as seriously as they take their education and careers. Which is not a bad thing. The kids will surely benefit. But the pressure to be the best mother misses a point: Given the realities of the 21st century society, not every woman can be ""mom enough."" For one thing, breastfeeding is not for all mothers. Successful breastfeeding -- especially extended breastfeeding -- takes a lot of planning, time off from paid work, money and resources. I, too, decided to breastfeed when I had my first baby. Everything I read said that breastfeeding was natural, intuitive, cheap and easy. But I found breastfeeding painful, time-consuming and difficult. And, when you factor in the extra amounts of healthy foods I was consuming (organic only, of course), the money I spent on gadgets and experts, and the house cleaner who allowed me to catch up on my sleep -- it wasn't cheap. I was not alone. A graduate student in sociology at the time when I had my baby, I interviewed women about breastfeeding. Most of them shared my experience. One woman listed the accessories she invested in: a special ""Boppy"" nursing pillow, a rocking chair, nursing bras, a pump, and herbal supplements (rumored to enhance milk supply). She estimated that by the time she got into a groove she'd spent close to a thousand dollars. And that's not counting household help. Another woman told me that for weeks she was fatigued, in pain and dreading every feeding. But she was a go-getter. The same attitude that got her through an Ivy League PhD program and helped her succeed in Silicon Valley helped her master breastfeeding. Granted, she saw a lactation consultant twice a week. Then there was a woman who likened her one-year breastfeeding goal to running a marathon (she had completed two). She was happy to finally swear off the three daily pumping sessions that allowed her to keep her baby off formula after her maternity leave ended. No mother really needs all the paraphernalia and experts in order to breastfeed. Most of the time, mothers' breasts produce sufficient milk and babies are adept at getting their food. So shouldn't we know better? Since the early 20th century, women were told that breast milk alternatives were the modern, scientific, superior and American way to go. The result? By the 1970s fewer than 25% of American women even tried to breastfeed and experiential knowledge had been lost. This explains why new mothers feel ill-prepared: They can't get advice from their mothers, aunts, grandmothers and neighbors. The women I interviewed took classes, read books, practiced with dolls, and met with lactation experts. Helpful, yes. Intuitive? Not really. Breastfeeding advocates raised legitimate concerns about breast milk alternatives (corn syrups for babies?) and many women who decided to breastfeed and practice attachment parenting genuinely believed that going natural was the better route. Hence, breastfeeding rates have been growing steadily for the last several decades for all groups of women, but especially for those who are white, educated and married. However, touting breastfeeding as the way to go defies logic. For all of its benefits to infants, breastfeeding on demand 24/7 is challenging when our sleep cycles are regulated by artificial light and we are separated from our baby for hours on end because of our jobs. Yes, we can use breast pumps to provide babies with breast milk. But pumps just aren't as efficient as babies at extracting milk. Mothers who go back to work find themselves fighting an uphill battle to maintain an adequate milk supply. Many spend hours a day at the pump before, during and after work. The lucky ones have a private space in which to pump and a fridge to store their milk. Some of the women I talked to weren't so lucky; they pumped in public bathrooms or cubicles that offered little privacy. One woman used a supply closet. Some mothers may have the financial means to quit their jobs and dedicate themselves to full-time parenting. For most women, this is not a viable choice, since the more time they spend away from work, the larger the negative impact on their potential lifetime earnings. Even for women who aim to be great mothers, breastfeeding is not always a feasible option. Branding breastfeeding as natural and economical without fully acknowledging the difficulties of balancing family and career creates unnecessary pressure and guilt. British psychologist Donald Winnicot understood this when he set his bar for good parenting. Rather than challenging women to be ""mom enough,"" he urged mothers to be ""good enough"" -- bottles of formula included. I was certainly happy to be a good enough mother. And by the time my kids hit preschool, nobody really cared whether and how long I had breastfed my children.

"(CNN) -- As a gay black man who came of age just before the 1969 Stonewall riots, I've seen far too many examples of the inequalities that exist in America. But I'm also highly encouraged by recent developments: same-sex marriage support from President Barack Obama and the NAACP, and a wave of federal court rulings -- from the Defense of Marriage Act being deemed unconstitutional to the rejection of California's Proposition 8 -- that have opened a promising new chapter in the gay rights movement. All of this suggests that after many, many years, we are finally piercing the stigma surrounding being gay in America. Now let's talk about erasing the stigma of HIV/AIDS. Right now, 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV/AIDS. I am one of them. First, the good news: Thanks to advances in medical treatment and technology, a positive HIV status is not the death sentence it was considered to be 20 years ago. Recent data suggest that a 25-year-old diagnosed with HIV and no other complicating symptoms, who immediately enters into comprehensive and adherent medical care, can expect to live more than 50 years beyond his or her diagnosis. This is roughly the same life expectancy as someone who does not have HIV. On the other hand, without the proper medical care, the life span of that same 25-year-old is reduced dramatically. Currently, only 19% of Americans living with HIV/AIDS are receiving the sustained care they need to extend and improve the quality of their lives. With 50,000 new U.S. cases confirmed every year, that's a problem. And in a global superpower, it's unconscionable. News: 25 years later, AIDS quilt displays an American tragedy . The reasons are complicated, ranging from the challenges borne from living in poverty (it's hard to prioritize your health care when meals and housing are more pressing) to a lack of HIV-experienced medical experts in rural areas. These are complex hurdles, and the solutions won't come easily. But there's one that will, if we all do our part. Stigma -- stemming from shame, fear of discrimination or a basic lack of understanding about the disease -- is all too often a major reason people living with HIV/AIDS fail to get tested or get into life-saving care and treatment. And its impact is devastating. Through AIDS United's work with organizations around the country that provide access to care to those living with HIV/AIDS, the stories we've heard are heartbreaking. Stories like the grandmother who was afraid to hug her 25-year-old HIV-positive grandson. The young man who was fired from his job because his boss found out he had HIV. The single mother and her young son, both HIV-positive, who were forbidden to swim in their community pool. Clearing up shame over HIV/AIDS in 21st-century America is not just a nice thing to do. It will lead more people to get tested. It will help them improve and save their lives. And it will prevent more transmissions. News: Gay, bisexual black men at high risk for HIV . On Sunday, 20,000 of the world's HIV/AIDS experts will gather in Washington for the International AIDS Conference -- an opportunity to create a blueprint for wiping out the disease for good. An important preconference panel will focus on the shame and stigma burdening men who have sex with men, particularly African-American men who are still silent or in denial about same-sex attraction. We will discuss new approaches for persuading them to come forward, get tested and access the care they need to make HIV a manageable, rather than a fatal, condition. But our work shouldn't be done in a bubble. Everyone has a role to play in bringing HIV/AIDS out of the shadows: . -- We must keep educating the everyday ""influencers"" -- the pastors, the beauticians, the shop owners -- anyone with a direct line to the communities at greatest risk who can launch straightforward, ongoing conversations about the disease and how to prevent it. Health: FDA approves Truvada for prevention of HIV/AIDS . -- We must continue to educate policymakers about the impact of HIV/AIDS on their constituents.

Other athletes and entertainers have come out in support of AIDS-related causes over the years, but we still need more of them to leverage their celebrity and keep this issue at the forefront of media attention.

"(CNN) -- The re-emergence of some vaccine-preventable diseases has prompted the California legislature to consider a bill that would make it more difficult for parents to opt out of vaccinating their kids. The legislation would require that parents get counseling from a doctor before opting out of immunizations for their children. Last year, the United States saw its highest number of reported measles cases in 15 years, even though the disease was eliminated from the country in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One theory behind this rise, according to Dr. Richard Pan, the state assemblyman who introduced the bill, is that the recent trend away from immunizing children. That's why he wants to make it more difficult to bypass vaccine requirements in his state. Jillian Edwards, a 27-year-old mother of two, is one of a number of parents who are not at all, or only partially, immunizing their kids. ""In the first year of their life, the kids get like 15 shots, which is so much for such a tiny body,"" Edwards said. ""I think it was more the likelihood of them catching the disease versus the likelihood of them having a bad reaction."" Dr. Steven Nishibayashi says that's a common sentiment among many parents when it comes time to immunize their kids -- even though it's not backed by science. ""Most of the fears about immunizations are not well founded,"" he said. Nishibayashi has been a pediatrician for 32 years. He said one of the most damaging works ever published about vaccines was a 1998 article in the medical journal The Lancet. It was written by the now-infamous Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who argued that there was a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines, and autism. Nishibayashi said, however, that no one knows what causes autism. Even with people refusing vaccines, or delaying them, or spacing them out, autism rates continue to rise, he said. Some scientists say that this is simply a function of more awareness, better diagnosis and a broadening of the definition of what constitutes the disorder. The Lancet retracted the Wakefield article in 2004 and Wakefield lost his medical license (Wakefield is now suing the British Medical Journal and one of its authors for defamation). But the damage had already been done. Many doctors believe parents' fears about vaccines -- brought on by the Wakefield article and other non-scientific information -- has lead to a resurgence of diseases like measles and Pertussis or Whooping Cough. In 2010, 10 children died in from Whooping Cough in California. The outbreak lead to a requirement that at age 10, before entering the seventh grade, kids must have a Pertussis booster shot. Nishibayashi said the result was that the following year there were no deaths from Pertussis. The World Health Organization is hopeful that legislation like the bill in California will turn the tide of parents opting out of vaccinations. The anti-vaccine movement is not helping the fight against measles in Europe. There were 37,000 cases of measles reported last year in all of Europe, compared to 222 cases in the United States. ""I would say that you have a very active, if not the most active, anti-vaccination lobby globally in the U.S.,"" said Robb Butler with the WHO. ""That certainly doesn't help, if I can be completely honest and open about this."" Nishibayashi said there is plenty of good and accurate science that shows there is no definitive link between vaccines and other problems like autism. The problem, said Nishibayashi, is that because vaccines are generally administered around the time that autism is first diagnosed in children -- the first two years of life -- there is no way to prove to an absolute statistical certainty that the two aren't related. ""That's where all this sort of quackery comes about,"" said Nishibayashi. The bill in the California legislature requiring medical counseling has passed the assembly and is headed for the Senate. Pan, author of the bill, says it looks like it will come up for a full Senate vote, and may pass before school resumes in the fall.","Bill would require counseling before parents can opt out of vaccinations for kids .

"(CNN) -- The victims and heirs of U.S. experiments involving sexually transmitted diseases and human subjects in Guatemala between 1946 and 1948 will appeal following the dismissal of their lawsuit against the U.S. government. U.S. rejects Guatemalans' STD lawsuit, offers aid . U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton ruled this week that the Guatemalans could not sue the United States for grievances that happened overseas. The judge also dismissed claims against current Obama Administration health officials, including Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, because they were not personally involved in the experiments. The studies on unknowing Guatemalan subjects ""is a deeply troubling chapter in our nation's history,"" Walton wrote in his decision. But, he said, under federal law, the court can not do anything for them. ""Their plea are more appropriately directed to the political branches of our government, who, if they choose, have the ability to grant some modicum of relief to those affected by the Guatemalan study,"" the decision states. The United States has apologized for the study, and President Barack Obama asked the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues to look into the details of the research and to assure him that current rules protect people from unethical treatment. The controversy centers on the U.S. Public Health Service Sexually Transmitted Disease Inoculation Study of 1946-1948, which was conducted to determine the effectiveness of penicillin in treating or preventing syphilis after subjects were exposed to the disease. Gonorrhea and chancres were also studied. Penicillin was a relatively new drug at the time. Researchers infected Guatemalans with STDs, commission affirms . The tests were carried out on female commercial sex workers, prisoners in the national penitentiary, patients in the national mental hospital and soldiers. According to the study, more than 1,600 people were infected: 696 with syphilis, 772 with gonorrhea and 142 with chancres. The lawsuit filed by the Guatemalan victims and their heirs compared the project to the Tuskegee syphilis experiment in Alabama. ""Naturally, we are disappointed by the decision and strongly disagree that these doctrines of immunity apply under the extreme circumstances of this case,"" said Terrence Collingsworth, attorney for the plaintiffs, in a statement. ""We plan to appeal and will continue to seek justice for the victims of these atrocious human rights violations committed by the U.S. Government.""

"(CNN) -- Matthew Allen's 10 brothers and sisters have grown up helping their parents take care of him. Ranging in age from 2 to 27, they are his playmates, his protectors, his teachers and his advocates. They taught him to talk, but they speak for him when he doesn't have the words. And they all dread the possible phone call bearing the news that something awful has happened to him. Matt's a middle child; he's 16, and he has autism. Living with his parents in Woodbridge, Virginia, Matt has limited verbal skills and often wanders away from home and into dangerous situations. He has attempted to climb electric towers and expects cars to stop for him if he steps into the street. ""We are all always worrying about him when we are not at home,"" said Matt's oldest sister, 27-year-old Sarah Allen. ""We also know that one day we will be responsible for him as guardians."" For National Autism Awareness Month, CNN iReport asked families affected by the disorder to tell the world what life is like. We heard from dozens of people with varying degrees of autism and Asperger's syndrome. Also, parents shared stories about raising children with the disorder. But few people have shared stories about the unique stresses and gifts that autism can bring to sibling relationships. Matthew was diagnosed with less severe autism initially, but as a toddler and preschooler he presented ""some of the most severe symptoms I've seen,"" said Allen. Now Matthew displays symptoms across a wide spectrum, from high functioning to ""more challenged,"" she said. Related story: With autism, no longer invisible . For example, Matthew can speak and he has an emotional interest in his family. He has adaptive skills, and he shows substantial cognitive understanding and can make simple logical connections. Like many people with autism, Matthew desires routine and sameness.Â Matthew also requires moment-by-moment supervision, his sister said, because he sometimes suddenly leaves the house and walks into the street or into neighbors' yards. Some of these dynamics are portrayed in TV series like NBC's ""Parenthood"" and films such as 1988's ""Rain Man,"" where autism poses challenges for brothers and sisters. Sarah Allen, now a special education teacher who works with children on the autism spectrum, recorded a video for iReport featuring Matt and his brothers and sisters. She said she's used to seeing autism awareness stories about higher functioning individuals, but less attention is given to children with more severe behavior problems and limited communication skills.

While they love Matt deeply, having a sibling with severe autism, she said, has put an immense burden on the family.

"(CNN) -- As the district director of physical education and health literacy for Miami-Dade County Public Schools, Jayne Greenberg's annual budget is $0. That's right -- $0. It's almost unbelievable when you know the statistics -- that one in six U.S. children are obese, that nearly one-third are overweight, and that these rates are even higher for Hispanic children (of whom Miami has a high population). But Greenberg doesn't despair. ""I've been in my position since 1995 -- I've never had a budget,"" she says. ""It's always been up to me to find my own money."" She has also found a way to encourage students to sign up for gym class again. Miami-Dade County Public Schools is one of nine regional finalists in the Active Schools Acceleration Project's first annual Innovation Competition. ASAP is an initiative started by ChildObesity180.org, an organization dedicated to reversing the trend in childhood obesity. The requirements were simple: Schools had to show a way they were encouraging students to move throughout the day. The school's program had to be creative, include all fitness levels and be easy to duplicate in other districts. ""We know there's so much good work going to get our kids up and moving every single day all across this country,"" first lady Michelle Obama says in the competition's introduction video. ""So we want to find the most effective ways that people are increasing physical activity for kids, and then help those ideas grow to scale so that they can help even more children."" More than 30 judges evaluated the hundreds of applications. Nine regional finalists were announced Tuesday; each will receive $25,000 to invest in physical activity programs. Two national winners will be announced in Washington on June 13. They will be given $100,000 and ChildObesity180 will work to expand their programs across the country. In Miami, only one semester of physical education is required for high school students, and middle school students can have a parent waive the regular class. That means a child could go from fifth grade to 12th grade without ever working up a sweat. Greenberg's solution was Fit-Tech Wellness Labs. With grant money, she converted classrooms in her local high schools into minigyms. These labs contain traverse climbing walls, gaming stationary bikes and virtual group fitness instructors. ""That's this generation's world,"" she says. ""I knew that to engage students in becoming more physically active I had to incorporate that technology."" It worked -- high school students started enrolling voluntarily and lost an average of 8 pounds a semester. Greenberg moved the program down into the middle schools, then the elementary schools. The kids loved it. ""I like the 'Dance Dance Revolution' (game),"" fifth-grader Taylor Wood says. ""Even though you don't think about it you're actually exercising."" Physical activity is a learned behavior, says one of the competition's judges, Avery Faigenbaum, a professor of health and exercise science at The College of New Jersey. ""In primary school we teach kids how to read and we teach kids how to write. We also have to teach kids how to move,"" he says. ""If we expose children to these environments that are rich in opportunities to be physically active, they're going to be more physically active as adults."" Faigenbaum rated highly the programs that incorporated movement into minibreaks throughout the school day. ""Many people look at this from the neck down, and they look at all the physical benefits. But when we're talking about kids in school, we also have to look at the neck up. Kids who are engaged in physical activity are better learners."" Another finalist, the Healthy Schools, Healthy Families' ""Just Move"" program in New York and New Jersey, added five-minute breaks into students' daily routine while addressing another obstacle in the fight to add physical activity in schools: how to avoid taking away classroom time. The ""Just Move"" program uses exercise flashcards that are linked to a grade's curriculum. In kindergarten, kids practice counting to 20 while doing jumping jacks. In fifth grade, they learn the difference between perpendicular and parallel lines while doing squats or talk about camels while doing the camel yoga pose. ""We had a much greater buy-in (from teachers) because it fits with what they already have to do,"" says Andrea Brekke, the Healthy Schools, Healthy Families program manager. Often, childhood obesity is attributed to a ""toxic environment,"" filled with endless hours of computer use and video game playing. But as Greenberg showed, technology can help in the fight against fat. ""The Walking Classroom"" podcast program -- where students listen to lectures while strolling outside -- and the online social game Sqord from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, were also winners in the ASAP competition. While technology doesn't change the physical environment by adding trails or gyms, it can make a positive impact, says competition judge Joan Dorn, branch chief for physical activity and health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Technology (ideas) ... change the social environment by incorporating the notion of getting physical activity throughout the day,"" says Dorn. ""They change the environment by changing the culture and the way of thinking.""","Active Schools Acceleration Project's Innovation Competition finalists announced .

"Mayflower, Arkansas (CNN) -- Janet Copeland and her husband, Richard, both say they agree almost all the time, with one exception: The Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's health care legislation. ""We're kind of split on that one,"" Janet says. ""It's one of the few heated discussions we have. Right now, I'm at the point where I've already told (Richard) that 'OK, if the person you want gets elected, sit back and watch.' We're in a little standoff about that one. There's never blood drawn, but it gets interesting."" Richard Copeland, a 62-year-old retired Army veteran, just rolls his eyes. ""I did not like the way it was shoved down our throats,"" Richard responds. ""What about the people that can't afford health insurance? What part of not being able to afford it doesn't our president understand? There are people out there working just to put bread on the table, and now he's saying 'I don't care if your family eats or not.' "" Richard's wife is having a hard time paying her health insurance. According to Families USA, a liberal-leaning health insurance advocacy group, Janet Copeland's situation is common. Families USA reported that before the passage of the ACA, some 2.3 million American families lost their health care each year because of price. The group believes the ACA will help families from being priced out of health insurance coverage. He says it's unfair to penalize his wife if she decides not to pay for coverage. He supports GOP candidate Mitt Romney. And Richard has health insurance through the Veterans Administration. But Janet, who is quickly using up her life savings to pay her monthly health premium, is fully supportive of Obamacare, and supports Democratic President Barack Obama in his re-election bid. But in ironic fashion, the reason this debate has come to the Copeland household is because the couple decided to get married. Watch behind the scenes interview with Janet Copeland . After getting married, the couple moved into a ranch style home on the banks of Lake Conway, just north of Little Rock. But before they started a life together, Janet Copeland was married for almost 50 years. The Arkansas native married her ex-husband at age 15. Janet raised two children, maintained the house, and painted portraits and landscapes on the side. ""I held one job during my marriage, working as an art instructor,"" Janet says. ""It wasn't for very long, and it wasn't for many hours per week."" After a long, unhappy marriage, Janet got divorced in her mid-60s. During the separation, Janet learned she did not work enough during her life to qualify for Social Security or reduced cost Medicare. So, she negotiated with her ex-husband, and he agreed to give her a small lump sum of money, along with subsidizing her health care premiums. While she was single, Janet Copeland paid just over $200 per month. ""Then I got married, and the whole thing changed,"" Janet says. Now, she pays $703 per month. When she remarried, Janet's ex-husband no longer paid any part of her health premium. She couldn't qualify for Medicaid, the government's health care program for the poor, because she had to count Richard's retirement income of about $2000 per month. So, Janet had to turn to her life savings. ""What I do is I've got it set up where I get $1,000 a month, it's like a trust, to pay my insurance and everything else,"" Janet says. ""It won't last me for a lifetime, I think, but right now, my insurance is taken care of."" Read Janet Copeland's original story on CNN iReport . What's important about Janet Copeland's story, says Anthony Wright, is that it illustrates how routine life changes can dramatically change individual health care costs. Wright is the executive director of Health Access, a California-based nonpartisan, not-for-profit think tank. ""A family's health insurance rate can change for a variety of reasons, both a birth in the family, a death in the family, a divorce,"" says Wright. ""Even somebody just doing the very natural thing of reaching (their) birthday. One of the worst birthday presents you can receive is a rate increase from your health insurer."" The presidential candidates each offer dramatically different policies on how to handle rate changes. In the most general terms, Wright says, Obama's signature health care law makes it harder to increase rates for routine life changes, while GOP candidate Mitt Romney wants to repeal that law entirely. ""We've always had candidates with different proposals, but we've never had an election which would really determine whether a whole set of benefits and consumer protections were at stake, where the line was so clearly drawn,"" he adds. How have you been affected by the health care ruling? Share your story with CNN iReport. Wright says Janet Copeland could benefit from some of the provisions of the Affordable Health Care act, like the expansion of Medicaid. The health care program serves low income citizens, and is run jointly by the federal government and the states. Yet, it's unclear how those provisions will be applied in the Copeland's home state of Arkansas. Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe will ultimately have to approve any expansion of Medicaid and Medicare in his state. Those are the provisions most likely to help Janet Copeland lower her Medicare premiums. Yet, the Democratic governor has issued statements indicating he is still studying the law and the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling. iReport Debate: Face-off on Supreme Court ruling . Many Arkansas Republicans have taken the position of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. The former GOP presidential candidate has long argued that Obamacare provisions, like expanding Medicaid, will bankrupt individual states. Perry, like Richard Copeland, also disagrees with the health care law on philosophical grounds. ""I will not be party to socializing health care and bankrupting my state in direct contradiction to our Constitution and our founding principles of limited government,"" Perry said in a statement shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled Obamacare is constitutional, Anthony Wright of Health Access says the outcome of this presidential election will determine whether the law is ultimately fully enforced. From a health care perspective, Wright says this election is ""the most important"" in U.S. history. Yet, despite the potential importance this election may have on their day-to-day lives, Janet and Richard Copeland may decide, as a couple, simply not to vote. ""We'll just end up canceling each other out,"" Janet says. ""But if we do decide to skip the vote, at least we're doing it together. Life is better with someone you love.""

"Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- A scandal erupted in Paraguay after hundreds of teachers were accused of dancing with strippers during an official retreat. The country's top education official has said she's investigating after a cell phone video showing teachers dancing with strippers was leaked to Paraguayan media, where headlines have described the event as an ""erotic party."" The teachers had permission to miss class and participate in team-building activities at a retreat outside the country's capital of Asuncion. But according to an investigation by the Ministry of Education and Culture, they didn't just discuss lesson plans or teaching at the April retreat. A cell phone video provided to CNN affiliate Telefuturo shows shirtless male strippers dancing with female teachers at the event as onlookers cheer and music blares. Some 800 teachers attended the event, officials said. ""The concern is, well, education is an essential service. So what are our motives for suspending classes? Well, for a day of training, right? Apparently with a union license. The content should be tied to educational priorities,"" Education Minister Marta Lafuente said. The Education Ministry is investigating 79 school directors who participated in the retreat, which took place at a ranch about 25 kilometers (15 miles) outside the capital. According to some school officials, the strippers' performances were not part of the event's official program and happened without the consent of the organizers. The president of the National Union of Directors of Public Institutions described the event as immoral and called for those responsible to be punished. First, the event's organizers should be sanctioned, union director Miguel Marecos said. But officials, he said, should take the punishment a step further. ""Then, take them to a spiritual retreat,"" he said, ""and talk to them a bit about values.""","A video shows teachers dancing with strippers at the retreat .

"(CNN) -- Q: I was shocked to read in the news that children as young as 7 are hurting themselves. Why would they do that? A: I'm often surprised by what surprises people. This study, recently published in the journal Pediatrics, has garnered tremendous media attention. The study found that approximately 8% of third-grade students had at some point in their lives engaged in non-suicidal self-injury. Examples of non-suicidal self-injury include hitting oneself, burning oneself, cutting or carving the skin and inserting sharp objects into the skin. Although it is extremely distressing that children engage in these types of behavior, I don't find it surprising it all. Three other things surprise me a good deal more. First, I am surprised that, before this study, most people assumed that children wouldn't engage in a behavior that is so common in teenagers and young adults. Why would we expect that non-suicidal self-injury would wait for puberty to make an appearance? We already know that certain genetic mutations, for example the mutation that causes Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome, can produce horrific self-mutilating behavior in even very young children. While people report engaging in non-suicidal self-injury for various reasons, almost always, they hurt themselves in response to stressful situations or negative emotions. Anyone who has children knows that they are subject to the same powerful emotions as adults. If a minority of adults responds to powerful emotions by harming themselves, why should children not do the same? This leads directly to the second thing that surprises me: that children below the age of puberty are considerably less likely to deliberately harm themselves than are adolescents or young adults. This finding is consistent with a lot of literature showing that children have far lower rates of mood, anxiety and psychotic disorders than adults do. This fact is often taken for granted in the mental health world, but it is really quite remarkable and not well-understood. After all, children are subject to extremely powerful emotions and have a tremendous capacity for fear and worry. Moreover, it is now very clear that childhood experiences are the strongest environmental determinants of developing mental illness as an adult. So why the delay? If the stresses and strains of childhood light the fuse for psychiatric illness, why does it take so long for the fuse to burn? I could fill pages with various theories, but I can't give a one- or two-sentence answer that encapsulates this unquestionable truth. The final thing about non-suicidal self-injury that surprises me is that it occurs at all. Anyone who has been depressed can understand how one might feel bad enough to want to escape the psychic pain through death. But why do so many people hurt themselves not because they want to die but because they want to hurt themselves? Again, there is no simple answer, but I find it fascinating that other mammals have been observed to harm themselves when under stress. Cats and dogs will lick and chew their bodies until they have wounds, and horses have been known to bite their own flanks. This suggests to me that self-injury might be related in some ways to a process, or processes, that have evolved over time. Whether this is true or not, one thing is very clear: Despite being painful, self-injurious behavior can become highly addictive. This is more often the case with women and usually involves cutting the skin, although I've treated patients over the years who were addicted to other types of self-damaging behavior, such as hitting themselves in the face or inserting sharp objects into various bodily orifices. Many people who cut on themselves report that this behavior has an irresistible pull; they feel better after opening their skin, either because they are calmer or because the pain makes them feel more alive. These reports have led to widespread theorizing that people become addicted to self-injurious behavior because the tissue damage leads to the release of natural, opioid-type chemicals in the body, giving them a ""natural high."" This idea immediately suggests that blocking such endogenous opioids with drugs might reduce or prevent cutting and other self-damaging behaviors. However, the fact that trials of opioid blockers have yielded conflicting and not very impressive results has lessened enthusiasm for these ideas. A final surprising truth about non-suicidal self-injury is that it exists in a complex relationship with actual suicidal behavior. You'd think that people who recurrently injured themselves would be at increased risk of committing suicide, but this is far from clear. People who engage in non-suicidal self-injury typically are struggling with other psychiatric conditions, such as a mood or personality disorder, so they are at increased risk of suicide generally. But the degree to which non-suicidal self-injurious behavior itself contributes to this increased risk is not well understood. In fact, the demographics of suicide and non-suicidal self-injury suggest that in some ways they are polar opposites. Most non-suicidal self-injury occurs in adolescent and young adult females and drops off sharply in prevalence with advancing age. On the other hand, most completed suicides occur in men, and the risk rises sharply with age. A study done a number of years ago really highlights this. Young adult females make 25 suicide attempts for every one completed suicide. Older men make 1.6 suicide attempts for every completed suicide. But, suicide attempts are only one kind of violence against the self. Our growing understanding of this fact has led to a proposal by the American Psychiatric Association that non-suicidal self-injury be given its own diagnostic category in the next edition of the DSM, which is the ""bible of psychiatric diagnoses"" in the U.S. Although the last thing psychiatry needs in general is another diagnostic category, the upside of this proposal is that it makes official something many patients have been trying to tell us for years: that their apparent suicidal behavior is not really motivated by an urge to kill themselves. Then we'd be able to officially believe them.","Study in Pediatrics journal says 8% of third-graders have purposefully injured themselves .

"(CNN) -- It was the most devastating news an unsuspecting new parent could ever hear. I couldn't wrap my brain around what the neurologist was telling me. Finally, I stopped her. ""Is this bad,"" I asked. ""Yes,"" she replied. ""So what you're telling me is that my son has a fatal disease?"" ""Yes,"" she said again. It was like someone had just pushed me off a cliff. Our son Jonah Weishaar was diagnosed with Sanfilippo Syndrome Type C in May 2010 when he was 22 months old. At the time of his diagnosis, he was asymptomatic, and he still is -- but the clock is ticking. Our geneticist gave us the best advice she could give in this situation. She told us that this didn't have to be a death sentence for Jonah. With the scientific advancements happening now, treatments that were unimaginable a few years ago are becoming a reality. This was all we needed to hear. We hit the ground running. A few weeks later, Jonah's Just Begun was formed. The foundation is aimed at curing Sanfilippo Syndrome. We have two goals: To drive the science that will ultimately lead to a cure, and to raise awareness for all rare diseases. Actor Jonny Lee Miller of the TV show ""Elementary"" is running a 50-mile ultra-marathon in honor of Jonah's Just Begun. Having him endorse us is a dream come true, and I'll never be able to thank him enough. We've also formed a consortium of scientists, clinicians and parents all focused on saving our children's lives. We call this consortium HANDS (Helping Advance Neurodegenerative Disease Science). Today, we have four research projects in the works. In the coming weeks we will announce the official Sanfilippo patient registry and a natural history study, which follows a group of people with a disease over time. A child's struggle inspires drive for cure . Sanfilippo Syndrome is caused by a single gene defect. Because of that defect, an enzyme is not produced. This enzyme's job is to break down heparan sulfate, a long sugar chain. If the heparan sulfate is not broken down, it's stored in every cell, and that causes a cascade of bodily dysfunctions. First affected is the central nervous system, causing profound brain damage. Also typical is hearing and vision loss, organ damage and bone deformities. Eventually a person dies after becoming unable to eat, walk or talk. There are four different enzymes responsible for breaking down heparan sulfate: They are designated A, B, C and D. Jonah has Sanfilippo C, which along with D is ultra-rare and occurs in one of 1.4 million births. Type A (one in 100,000 births) and Type B (one in 200,000 births) are more common and thought to be more severe. Most children with those types don't live past their teenage years. Type C and D children usually have less severe symptoms. The children suffer brain damage in early elementary school; some live into their mid-20s. Most children succumb to organ failure or upper respiratory infections. A rare disease in the smallest of patients . Children appear normal at birth, meeting their milestones. During the preschool years parents start to notice something wrong and the children seem to slow developmentally. Their speech is delayed, in part due to accumulated fluid in the middle ears. They have constant ear and upper respiratory infections, along with diarrhea. The texture of their hair turns kinky and thick. The children are described as having ""coarse"" features -- protruding foreheads, thick eyebrows, flat noses and full lips. Next the children start to behave erratically, with hyperactivity, sleep disturbances and compulsions. The skills they have learned fall by the wayside. They are back in diapers, wandering aimlessly. Some stop sleeping for days. Jonah is 4 years old now, and we've seen no sign of cognitive delay or regression. He does have a speech delay because of fluid in his middle ear, and he is on his third set of tubes. He's constantly congested and has minor bone deformities -- flared ribs and a raised sternum, for example. He goes to preschool full-time and has speech, occupational and physical therapy. He's happy and full of life, a character and the light of our lives. There are close to 7,000 rare diseases affecting about 25 million people in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. About 80% of them are genetic, and it is estimated about half affect children. Sanfilippo is not complicated like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, it's just ultra-rare, so the pharmaceutical industry has not taken notice. Very few federal dollars are allocated for funding rare disease research, and most go toward the diseases with larger patient populations. A disease is considered rare in the United States if fewer than 200,000 people have it. Sanfilippo type C has a known patient population of 16 kids in the United States. Living with a rare disease, making a difference . It's left to the parents to lay all the groundwork to de-risk treatments for the drug makers. Our consortium wants to create a patient registry, conduct a natural history study and fund a treatment so we can hand it over to a drug company in hopes a treatment will be created. Jonah could be the first child to ever walk away from Sanfilippo type C. He's priceless, and just like the thousands of other children affected by a rare and fatal genetic disease, he deserves a chance to live.","Jill Wood's 4-year-old son Jonah has a rare and fatal disease .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A full autopsy report on the death of conservative blogger and activist Andrew Breitbart was released Wednesday, concluding that he died of heart failure as a result of coronary artery disease and an enlarged heart, coroner officials announced. No significant trauma was detected, and foul play is not suspected, the Los Angeles County coroner's report said. Breitbart, 43, died on March 1 after collapsing on a sidewalk in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood. He was transported to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and pronounced dead about 40 minutes later when emergency physicians were unable to revive him. According to the autopsy report, Breitbart had been diagnosed with congestive heart failure in 2011 after being rushed by ambulance to the same hospital because he had shortness of breath. Opinion: How Breitbart changed the news . He was released from the hospital after a few days in 2011, and he began exercising and dieting, the report said. The 6-foot-3, 251-pound Breitbart was considered ""a light drinker,"" and he had 0.04 gram percent of alcohol in his blood and heart at the time of his death, the autopsy report said. He also had 60% narrowing of the coronary artery, the report said. A few weeks before his death, Breitbart had been recovering from flu symptoms and complained about ""being under a lot of stress"" but no further problems were noted, according to the autopsy findings. No prescription or illicit drugs were found in his system, the report said.","Conservative activist Andrew Breitbart died of heart failure and had an enlarged heart .

"(CNN) -- A drug already approved for treatment of AIDS might one day be approved for prevention of the deadly disease in individuals at high risk. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee recommended Thursday that the agency approve the drug, Truvada, for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. The committee voted 19-3 in favor of approval for the prevention indication -- PrEP for HIV-uninfected men who have sex with men and 19-2 with one abstention for HIV-uninfected partners in couples where the other partner is infected. The committee recommended by 12-8 with two abstentions in favor of approving the drug for individuals who engage in risky sexual behavior that could result in their contracting the virus. Truvada, manufactured by Gilead Sciences, Inc., is a once-a-day pill used in combination with other HIV drugs. The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor does not rid the body of HIV. Instead, it prevents the virus from replicating in the body. The FDA doesn't have to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees, but it often does. Most of the more than 40 health care professionals, AIDS advocates and patients who addressed the committee implored its members not to recommend the drug for the new indication. ""There is no question that, if efforts on using PrEP is widespread, condom use and other means of preventing HIV infection will decrease,"" said Robert Elliott, a registered nurse. ""At this point we simply don't know enough about how to increase adherence rates to work with the PrEP or how to counteract the risk compensation and the use of PrEP. Until then, PrEP is not and cannot be considered safe and effective for preventing HIV infections."" AIDS Activist Miki Jackson agreed. ""A recommendation for the use of Truvada as PrEP is akin to issuing an engraved invitation for lawsuits,"" she said. ""To knowingly recommend a drug as powerful as Truvada with such serious serious side effects and given to people who are perfectly healthy is frightening."" Michael Weinstein, president and founder of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, said he was concerned that approval could lead a decrease in condom use. ""Approving PrEP would be a reckless act,"" he said. The FDA panel looked at safety and efficacy data from three clinical trials: . -- iPrEx, a study of men who have sex with men, found 43.8% fewer infections in men who got the drug versus those who got placebo; . -- in a Truvada study carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Botswana, infection rates were reduced by 63% overall in healthy men and women considered to be at high risk of infection; . -- the University of Washington's Partners in PrEP study of serodiscordant couples in Kenya saw 62% fewer infections in those taking Truvada and a 73% reduction in those who took a combination of Truvada and the HIV drug tenofovir. Committee members also heard concerns about the drug's side effects, which can include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, loss of appetite and diarrhea, liver and kidney toxicity and loss of bone density. But, after assessing the data, they concluded that Truvada is safe for men and women and effective in preventing infection. And they had supporters. ""What we need currently is additional tools for our powerful tool box,"" said Dr. Richard Elion, director of clinical research at the Whitman Walker Clinic in Washington. ""We are not winning the battle. Please, were asking today to allow a modality that's still being developed to be added to our toolbox."" Kirk Myers, founder and CEO of Abounding Prosperity Inc., made a plea on behalf of African-Americans. ""People need to be given the option to choose,"" said Myers, who is HIV-positive. ""This drug is wanted. Another tool we can use. The right thing to do. Without this option, desperation will continue to drive up statistics of new incidents."" Chris Collins, vice president and director of public policy for the American Foundation for AIDS Research, said the data on the drug's prophylactic use were compelling and urged the committee not to limit access to it. ""We need new tools to fight this epidemic that include treatment, condoms and education,"" Collins said. ""PrEP is certainly not for everyone, but it may have a role in bringing HIV-infection rates down. It's time to learn how PrEP may be useful in the real world."" According to Dr. Peter S. Miele, a medical officer in the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Truvada's safety and efficacy for the prevention of HIV-1 infection in high-risk individuals is supported by two large clinical trials. ""Regular HIV testing, adherence and behavioral counseling on safer sex practices, including condom use, are essential components of healthcare delivery around PrEP,"" he said. Truvada is not cheap. A month's supply costs about $1,200.","Advisory committee recommends Truvan be approved as a preventive .

"(Time.com) -- Why do some people find it impossible to get rid of old newspapers and junk mail, and end up hoarding them instead? New research suggests that hoarders have unique patterns of brain activity when faced with making decisions about their possessions, compared with healthy people. And despite the fact that hoarding has traditionally been seen as a symptom or subtype of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), brain activity in those who cannot de-clutter is also distinct from that of people with typical OCD, the study shows. ""Many things are unique and distinct about hoarding,"" says Dr. Eric Hollander, director of the autism and obsessive compulsive spectrum disorder program at Montefiore/Albert Einstein School of Medicine in New York, who was not associated with the new research. He notes that the new study adds to the evidence that hoarding should be recognized as a specific syndrome that falls not under the standard definition of OCD — only about 18% of people with hoarding symptoms meet the full criteria for OCD as it is currently defined — but within a spectrum of related conditions. ""[This] is a very interesting and important study,"" he says. Indeed, a separate diagnosis of hoarding disorder has been proposed for inclusion in the upcoming revision of psychiatry's diagnostic manual, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Time.com: Real-world hoarders and obsessive-compulsives . For the new research, published in the Archives of General Psychiatry, David Tolin of the Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut, recruited 107 people for brain scans using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Forty-three people had hoarding disorder, 31 people had OCD and 33 participants were normal controls. The participants were asked to bring a sample of their own junk mail or newspapers to the lab and were assured that researchers wouldn't throw out anything they wanted to keep. The participants were also told that while they were having their brain activity imaged, they would be asked to decide whether to keep or shred these papers. Inside the scanner, the participants were shown images of either their own stuff — preceded by a slide identifying it as ""Yours"" — or images of junk mail and newspapers from the lab, labeled ""Ours."" For each item, they had to decide whether or not to submit it to the shredder. Not surprisingly, people with hoarding disorder chose to keep more of their own items than did those with OCD or those without a diagnosis. When they were faced with tossing or keeping their own items, the hoarders' brain responses also differed from that of the other participants: they showed excessive activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region involved with decision-making, particularly in situations involving conflicting information or uncertainty. Activity was also elevated in the insula, a region that monitors one's emotional and physical state (it's also involved in disgust, shame and other strong negative emotions). Together, these regions help assign relative levels of importance or significance to objects. Time.com: A better way to treat obsessive-compulsive kids . ""Hoarders have great difficulty making decisions, especially around the value of their possessions,"" says Michael Jenike, an OCD expert and professor of psychiatry at Harvard, who was not associated with the research. ""This study is very interesting as it demonstrates that brain regions associated with monitoring for errors under conditions of uncertainty are activated when hoarding patients are deciding whether or not to throw out personal items."" In other words, hoarders assign too much value to their possessions, making it difficult or impossible to decide to get rid of them. Consequently, the study found that people with hoarding disorder took much longer to make decisions about discarding their possessions and felt more sadness and anxiety about these choices than did the other participants. ""One of the characteristics of hoarding is that people feel this sense of discomfort if they feel like they may be giving away something that they could use in future,"" says Hollander, explaining that patients often become greatly distressed or even angry if they are pushed to give up apparently useless or excess possessions. Interestingly, however, when people with hoarding disorder made similar decisions about discarding junk mail that didn't belong to them, they again showed unusual levels of activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula — but in this case, their brain activity was much lower than normal. The paper's authors note that the reduced activity is a ""pattern reminiscent of that seen in patients with autism,"" who are often disengaged from others and who, like hoarders, have rigid routines as well as obsessive behavior. The authors suggest that this lack of brain activity could be linked with the ""diminished motivation and poor insight frequently observed"" in patients who hoard; that is, it may be what allows them to live amidst overwhelming clutter and piles of junk, but fail to clear it out or even be bothered by it.

Meanwhile, the hyperactivity in these regions may make them overly anxious about and attached to their own possessions, rendering them too overwhelmed to decide to change. Hollander compares it to a ""check engine"" light that keeps flashing on the dash for no reason. A healthy person might be able to disregard the alarm as irrelevant, but the hoarder becomes obsessively focused on it. ""One problem with hoarding, and with OCD, is that when that alarm goes off, it becomes more and more important and the brain pays more and more attention to these signals."" says Hollander. ""The [person's] specific concern becomes more and more salient and other routines and activities become less salient, and that's what's associated with functional consequences. Their lives get smaller and smaller."" So, it's not that hoarders are slobs or obsessive collectors. Rather, it's that they have problems making the kinds of decisions about their stuff that others would consider reasonable. Time.com: How supermarkets turn shoppers into hoarders . Hollander notes also that the new findings could have important implications for the treatment of hoarding. A new type of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), for example — a therapy that uses non-invasive electrical stimulation of the brain to treat depression — may work for people with hoarding disorder. Although the TMS currently used for depression doesn't reach all brain regions, the new type may be able to affect the insula. ""Because of the shape of the coil, it can penetrate more deeply into brain,"" says Hollander. ""This study suggests that if you want to treating hoarding, the insula would be a good target.""

"(CNN) -- How can it be that we are firmly into the 21st century and reading claims that birth control pills can cause prostate cancer and abort babies? Or, my personal favorite, that a woman can be considered pregnant before her egg unites with a sperm? Such falsehoods are being touted not by yahoos but by educated conservatives who, in growing numbers, choose to ignore what science tells them. According to a paper in a recent American Sociological Review, conservatives with at least a bachelor's degree have, over the last several decades, lost their faith in science to an amazing degree. Although the paper doesn't cite advances in contraception specifically, they are clearly one victim of this disaffection. Our country's top health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, counts contraception as one of the 10 greatest health achievements of the 20th century. Yet recently: . -- A state legislator from New Hampshire, opposed to insurance companies being required to pay for birth control, called attention to a report suggesting that birth control pills cause prostate cancer. (Certain drugs in those pills become waste and eventually pass into the environment, according to the report, exposing men to carcinogens.) The representative based her statement on findings that originally appeared in the British Medical Journal, findings that one author of the study later characterized as only a hypothesis, and were seriously questioned in a subsequent BMJ article. -- Some members of Congress, in their attempt to derail legislation requiring insurers, including the insurers of some religious organizations, to cover birth control, falsely argued that Plan B, the ""morning after"" pill taken after sex in order to avoid pregnancy, causes abortions. It does not, nor do other methods of contraception, James N. Martin, Jr., president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, pointed out in a letter to the editor in USA Today. ""The definition of contraception is to prevent pregnancy, which occurs at implantation,"" he wrote. The morning-after pill is often confused with another drug, RU-486, which, he said, does induce abortion and is therefore not considered contraception. -- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law a bill prohibiting abortions that occur 20 weeks after a woman's last period begins. (This is in contrast to starting the 20-week count about two weeks later, when fertilization likely occurs.) As Amanda Marcotte notes in RH Reality Check, Arizona conservatives, in effect, said that women could be pregnant before egg and sperm unite. Apparently they were dozing off during ninth-grade biology. Not all political conservatives are Flat Earthers, of course. But there are proportionately more of them than there used to be, according to the Review article. For that piece, Gordon Gauchat, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, analyzed information from the General Social Survey, conducted every year since 1972 by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. He found that in 1974, the year Republican Gerald Ford became president, 48% of conservatives trusted science, a higher proportion, interestingly, than found among liberals or moderates. By 2010, however, that number had fallen to 34%, while the degree of trust among moderates and liberals remained stable. Of particular note: Confidence dropped among conservatives who held bachelor's degrees, not those who only finished high school. Gauchat theorized that because educated conservatives are more politically engaged than other voting blocs, they are more likely to seek information that conforms to their ideology. As the Los Angeles Times, writing about Gauchat's work, pointed out, some of them have big money to spend spreading their ideas. ""Right-wing think tanks, funded by corporate interests to undermine the scientific consensus on such expensive-to-fix phenomena as climate change, have proliferated, as have conservative cable-TV networks, blogs and radio talk shows,"" the Times noted. ""These outlets are talking to a well-educated audience. And they're presenting a very one-sided view of scientific issues."" Gauchat also wrote about the influence of the religious right, ""which rejects scientific contradictions of religious teachings on such issues as evolution and stem-cell research, and the growing use of science to inform public policy in such areas as environmental protection."" ""Conservatives, ever wary of government interference with the free market, started to resent the scientists. ... Rather than debate remedies, they have turned on science itself. ... (They) really have their own subculture, complete with ontological claims about what the world is about."" Here's what the world is really about when it comes to using birth control: Women, notably millennials, the largest generation ever, are pursuing higher education, jobs and careers, having sex and bearing children, all according to a timetable that works best for them, their partners and their babies. They couldn't do this if birth control wasn't accessible, affordable and safe. Demonizing it amounts to telling these women to throw out their briefcases and take up their vacuum cleaners. Conservative opposition to contraception has a last-gasp ring to it, and most Americans know that. One indication is a poll recently published by the Public Religion Research Institute, a think tank supported by a broad spectrum of scientists and religious experts. The poll showed a majority of Americans, including a majority of Catholics, believe that most employers should be required to provide their employees with health care plans that cover contraception at no cost. Another sign of change is the perceptible ease with which young men talk about and support contraception, including methods being developed for them. Nick Halzack, a 23-year-old policy intern working in Washington, says he looks forward to the day when male birth control, in various testing stages around the country, goes on the market. ""My generation has always had contraception,"" he says. ""It was a part of our sex education and is a part of our relationships. We are just beginning to get engaged in the politics, and the fight against it is a losing battle.""
