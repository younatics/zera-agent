"(CNN) -- All the traditional elements were in place for Joseph and Fiona Long's 2009 New Year's Eve wedding. She wore a white dress; he wore a tuxedo and her family wore kilts in honor of her Scottish heritage. After they exchanged vows and rings and sealed the deal with a kiss, an officiant in a black robe pronounced them husband and wife. Then, they dined and danced the night away at an Atlanta country club with their closest friends and loved ones, culminating in a midnight confetti drop. Missing from the guest list: God. The Longs are atheists who did not want gods or religious texts involved in their marriage celebration. But apart from the non-church setting, the only hint at an deliberately non-religious wedding was contained within their vows and readings. These included selections from Shakespeare, Robert Burns and the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage, which they felt ""beautifully expressed the social and secular significance of marriage without any appeal to religion,"" said Joseph Long, a lawyer in Tampa, Florida. ""We felt it made the point well that you can have the sanctity of marriage without having to fit into a particular group,"" he said. ""It basically states that marriage is extremely important in society for a variety of reasons, regardless of what someone's god thinks about it."" As secularism continues to rise in the United States, more couples like the Longs are deviating from a traditional wedding blueprint that includes prayers, blessings and biblical passages. ""A secular wedding can be exactly like a religious wedding with two key differences: no mention of any deities and no recitation of supposedly sacred texts,"" said David G. McAfee, author of ""Mom, Dad, I'm an Atheist: The Guide to Coming Out as a Non-Believer and Disproving Christianity and other Secular Writings."" ""Many secular weddings have vows, flowers, rings, a reception, a kiss at the end,"" he continued. ""Although most religions have incorporated marriage rules and ceremonies into their faiths, the act of marriage itself is not a religious one; it's a human one."" Venues, readings and vows are just some considerations for atheist couples or couples planning secular weddings. Others struggle with how to break the news to relatives or meet their demands, especially if those loved ones are helping pay for it. Some couples provide relatives with opportunities to say a few words within set parameters during the ceremony or reception, said Ed Buckner, former president of American Atheists and current chair of the Atlanta Freethought Society. He has performed several atheist weddings over the past decade and emphasizes that it's important to talk about it ahead of time, openly and honestly. ""You need to stop and think about what you want to accomplish. Are you trying to publicly commit to a lifelong union with your partner on your terms, or do you want to please others?"" he said. ""I would argue that if you don't believe in God and have God blessing the celebration, you're participating in a sham. But, there are ways to to acknowledge God for others, if that's what you want,"" Buckner advised. Give fair warning . Buying a home was more important to Wendy Rank and her fiance than spending big bucks on a wedding. Instead, they went to a justice of the peace in September ""for the official stuff"" and held a ""picnic wedding"" in their backyard later in the day. Her mother paid for catering while more local guests brought side dishes. ""We wanted to get married, but we're not really comfortable with doing it in a church and all that stuff,"" Rank said. ""We're introverts, so we didn't want a big wedding. Just a few friends and family. This way, we had a wedding and a housewarming party."" They wanted to keep it simple and inexpensive for everyone. Rank comes from a family of believers, so she felt like she needed to warn them on the wedding invitation with a message to the effect of: ""This is a small, nontraditional secular service. If you're comfortable with that, we'd love to have you."" Most relatives ended up coming, though no one who didn't show up explicitly cited the secular event as the reason. ""We wanted to put it out there so no one would book a flight and fly 3,000 miles expecting a pastor and a ceremony."" It worked out for the guests as well; several of her mother's religious friends said they enjoyed the wedding it because it was ""short and sweet."" Rank's sister and brother-in-law did a reading from Calvin and Hobbes before the couple exchanged rings and planted a tree -- their twist on a unity candle. ""No one said anything or seemed to or care that it was secular or atheist wedding,"" said Rank, who lives outside Nashville, Tennessee. ""It was a perfect day."" Elope now, wedding later . Darren and Sheena Thomas are proud atheists who met on the dating site OK Cupid. Both come from deeply religious families. As the son of a nondenominational Christian pastor, Darren Thomas grew up going on mission trips and attending church camp. At 16, he stopped going to church and became the black sheep of the family. In his 20s, he started identifying as atheist, meaning he doesn't believe in ""anything supernatural: God, the afterlife, ghosts, spirits, supernatural souls, anything like that."" When he came out to his parents, they tried to convince him to return to Christianity for a period of time. Eventually, his father acknowledged that there was nothing he could say or do and decided it was up to God to change his son's mind. He would always love and support his son. Still, after Darren proposed to Sheena in February, it was hard to tell his father that he didn't want him to perform the wedding. ""I tried to frame it in a positive light; I told him I wanted him to enjoy it without having to work it,"" said Darren Thomas, a high school English teacher. ""But we're pretty passionate about our beliefs, and we want to have a secular service with no mention of God, Jesus, eternity or blessings."" Growing up in West, Texas, Sheena Thomas and her family were pretty much the only people of color, so religion was a way for her to fit in, make friends and be part of a community. In college, she was exposed to a broad swath of faiths, ethnicities and sexual orientations. Sheena began to question her own beliefs and came to realize that atheism felt right for her. Her family still struggles with this decision; her mother periodically laments that she won't see her daughter in the afterlife, and her grandparents say they are praying for her. She keeps discussion of religion to a minimum. Their attitude toward religion contributed in part to the couple's decision to elope in August, about a year before they'd originally planned to have a wedding. Everyone knew the couple had gotten engaged in February, but when Sheena Thomas lost her job, they decided to get legally married without the celebration. ""We basically decided that it would be easier to tell everyone after the fact,"" Darren Thomas said. The Thomases made it official and then brought a wedding photographer to Denver's Red Rock amphitheater, the site of their first date in 2011. They still plan on throwing a book-themed wedding in July 2014 to celebrate their relationship and their shared passion. Sheena, a librarian, is working on bouquets and centerpieces of book pages, and the save-the-dates are made from old library due date cards. The Thomases haven't decided on readings, but they're leaning toward some of their favorite texts related to love and romance. Darren's looking at something from ""Jane Eyre"" or ""Love in the Time of Cholera."" For Sheena, it might be Kurt Vonnegut. ""What has bothered me about some weddings is, the focus becomes God and religion when it should be about the two of you and your and relationship,"" Sheena Thomas said. ""I like that our wedding is going to be focused on us and our love."" Is it important to you that a wedding have religious elements?

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Ted Cruz lauded the Republican Senate takeover Tuesday night, but shied away from endorsing Sen. Mitch McConnell to lead the new majority. The Texas Republican declined to say whether he would vote for McConnell -- the current Senate minority leader -- to become the Senate majority leader. ""That'll be a decision for the conference to make and that'll be decided next week,"" Cruz told CNN's Wolf Blitzer twice on CNN. ""Tonight what I'm focused on is the results of this election, which is a resounding Republican majority,"" Cruz said. It's not the first time that Cruz, a tea party favorite and potential 2016 presidential contender, has skirted the question, also declining to pledge his loyalty to McConnell in an interview with The Washington Post published Sunday. But Cruz did say that Americans are ""frustrated with what's happening in Washington."" And McConnell might just be the face of that Republican establishment, having served in Congress for the past three decades. ""Now the responsibility falls on us to lead with a positive, bold, optimistic, pro-jobs agenda and I hope that we see Republicans unite,"" Cruz said. ""I think a lot of voters are skeptical of politicians in both parties and I very much hope that my party can validate and earn the trust that's been placed in us and that we can stand up, listen to the people."" Cruz also said he believes Republicans will be willing to work with Obama ""if the President is willing to work with us."" And Cruz said Republicans need to pass legislation to repeal Obamacare, though he conceded that Obama would ""almost surely"" veto full repeal.

"(CNN) -- A San Francisco tour guide's expletive-laced rant about Chinatown on her last day of work has angered a metropolis used to celebrating the diverse and welcoming City by the Bay. Her performance has gone viral, reaching way beyond her audience of tourists -- perhaps something she didn't expect when she played to the tourists' smart phones. ""F-k your little seafood f-ing markets with your turtles and frogs inside,"" said the tour guide, using a microphone to shout at her tour group. ""Here in America, we don't eat turtles and frogs ... you got to assimilate a little bit, Chinatown."" Her tirade has already gotten more than 600,000 views on YouTube. While some tourists on her tour bus applauded, San Franciscans -- including the city's top Chinese-American elected officials -- rallied against her speech. 'Ghetto' tours of Bronx ended after outrage . They include San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and city Board of Supervisors President David Chiu, now running for state Assembly. ""It was amazingly disheartening and disturbing in 2014 that someone would say something so hurtful,"" Chiu told CNN on Friday. ""Hopefully we'll be able to use as a learning moment to build on,"" he said. ""Not just for this tour guide and company, but for the community to say we stand up against racism and celebration of our diversity."" The tour bus company and the tour guide apologized directly to Chiu, he said. In San Francisco, the tour guide's rant runs counter to the city's ethos, to say the least. The city has a long and storied history of acceptance, not just tolerance. Its residents have been on the forefront of many civil rights battles, including immigrant rights, homeless issues, ""a living wage,"" gay rights and treatment of people with HIV and AIDS. Moreover, San Francisco's Chinatown is home to a sizable population of people of Chinese descent, and the city claims its Chinatown is the oldest in North America. San Francisco's population of 800,000 is more than one-third Asian-American, and the largest subset is people of Chinese descent (21.4%), according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Something for a tour guide to consider.","San Francisco tour guide's Chinatown tirade caught on video .

"(CNN) -- The Syrian Electronic Army, a group of pro-Syrian regime hackers that has aggressively targeted major news organizations and activists, has claimed credit for a 20-hour-long outage of the New York Times website. Several Twitter users posted screenshots of a ""Hacked by SEA"" message they said they received when they went to the New York Times homepage Tuesday. It's not the first such action by the group; in recent months, it claims to have hacked major UK and U.S. news organizations, as well as Columbia University and rights group Human Rights Watch. CNN.com has been the target of similar attacks. After the latest apparent hack, fresh questions are being asked about what the Syrian Electronic Army is, where it's from and how it operates. But, says Helmi Noman, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, much about the group remains unknown. He has been tracking the Syrian Electronic Army since May 2011, when it emerged as an organized group with a Facebook page and then its own website. In its own words, on that website, the Syrian Electronic Army says, ""We are a group of enthusiastic Syrian youths who could not stay passive towards the massive distortion of facts about the recent uprising in Syria."" The group appears to have made it its mission to embarrass media organizations in the United States and European nations it perceives as hostile to the government of President Bashar al-Assad. According to Noman, the claimed attack on the New York Times takes the group's operations to a new level. ""Previous ones were just defacing websites, which was a kind of political graffiti, if you like,"" he said. But to take control of the domain name means that the group could redirect traffic, giving it the potential to expose people to malicious websites or code, he said, and represents a ""serious escalation."" The attack came as governments in several countries considered military action in light of reports that al-Assad has used chemical weapons against his own people in an effort to quell an uprising calling for his ouster. Right after the attack, the Syrian Electronic Army posted a comment, since deleted but logged by Noman, on its Facebook page. ""They said they are determined to escalate attacks on websites belonging to the United States, European countries and all the countries preparing a possible military action against Syria,"" Noman said. This suggests that the group will try to carry out more serious attacks, he said, adding that ""it's time that the Syrian Electronic Army be taken seriously."" 'Tacit support' from Syria . One key question revolves around how close the group is to the al-Assad government, which has now been involved in a bloody civil war for more than two years. On that subject, all the signs are of ""tacit support,"" Noman said. No evidence has emerged to support the idea that the group is a government operation, he said, but ""they are close enough to the Syrian regime to be able to operate freely in a country with a regime that is known for its restrictive legal and technical measures."" Al-Assad has previously backed the Syrian Electronic Army by name and ""expressed his appreciation for their work and described them as a real army on the Internet,"" Noman said. The group's domain name was registered by the Syrian Computer Society, which was headed by al-Assad in the 1990s, before he was president, he added. The Syrian Electronic Army was even hosted on the network of the Syrian government until June, when the domain name was suddenly suspended. The group was without a website for a short time before reappearing on a commercial Russian service, Noman said. The domain name's suspension occurred a few days after the U.S. government seized several key Syrian government sites, Noman said, leading researchers to believe that the move was intended to create some distance between the hacker group and the Syrian government. While there's no evidence linking the Syrian Electronic Army to the Russian authorities, Moscow is seen as friendly to the al-Assad regime, making it unlikely that the Russian company will be asked to stop hosting it. Mystery members . Who the individual members of the Syrian Electronic Army are and where they're from is also shrouded in mystery. They claim to be mostly Syrians in Syria, but the group also recruits members through Facebook, Twitter and its website, Noman said. A core appears to coordinate attacks, but the group solicits suggestions for targets through an open forum. It also appears robust, bouncing back despite the efforts of U.S. authorities and Twitter to suspend its activities and developing its methods over time. Early attacks focused on apparently irrelevant websites, but later efforts shifted toward compromising first the Facebook pages of organizations seen as hostile to the Syrian government and then high-profile Twitter accounts and the New York Times website. In the early days, it used DDOS, or distributed denial of service, attacks, but its methods then grew more sophisticated. And it may operate in cyberspace, but its attacks can have real-life impact, as was shown when the group hacked the Associated Press Twitter feed in April. It sent out a tweet reading, ""Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured,"" causing a brief flurry of panic and temporarily sending stocks plummeting. Noman predicts that the group will continue to look for soft spots to exploit in the wake of the attack on the New York Times. ""It's not just what they want to do or could do; it's what are the available vulnerabilities out there,"" he said. The hackers will probably continue to target the websites of U.S. and European media organizations, as well as some Arab sites, especially if international military intervention does occur in Syria, he said. They could carry out more DDOS attacks and may seek to use malicious software to steal private information from Syrian dissidents, he said. As well as wanting to stay one step ahead of the CIA, competition is a factor in spurring them on. In recent weeks, some anti-Assad groups have emerged, one calling itself the al-Nusra Electronic Army, in a reference to one of the key rebel groups involved in the fight against al-Assad's forces. A sectarian divide has also emerged, with some Shiite groups defacing Sunni groups' websites and vice versa, Noman said. Against this backdrop, the Syrian Electronic Army is not likely to quit cyberspace any time soon, and the New York Times may not be the last to fall victim to its efforts. ""It's up to the media to beef up their security so they cannot carry out these kinds of attacks,"" Noman warned . AP hack proves Twitter has a serious cybersecurity problem .

"(CNN) -- He apparently did NOT ""mind the gap."" A man in Perth, Australia, somehow slipped and got his leg stuck in the narrow space between a commuter train and the platform Wednesday. Closed circuit TV captured the incident at the Stirling Station and showed another passenger immediately raising the alarm. Authorities tried to pull the man out, but when that didn't work, they asked passengers to step out of the wagons and help push the six-car train in an effort to widen the gap, according to CNN affiliate Seven Network. About 50 commuters lined up along the side of the train, and after two collective pushes, the man was able to free his left leg. The commuter was examined by medics, but was not hurt, Seven Network said. He has not been identified. Fellow passenger Nicolas Taylor told PerthNow the man seemed a little embarrassed, ""because right where he fell was the 'mind the gap' writing.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday that the controversial tactic that allowed illegal guns to be smuggled to Mexico ""should never have happened, and it must never happen again."" In testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Holder hit hard at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives practice that has tainted his tenure at the Justice Department and led to some Republican calls for him to resign. ""I want to be clear: Any instance of so-called 'gun walking' is unacceptable,"" Holder said of weapons smuggling, later adding: ""This operation was flawed in its concept, and flawed in its execution."" Holder acknowledged what critics have been saying about the long-term consequences of ""gun walking."" ""Unfortunately we will feel its effects for years to come, as guns that were lost during this operation continue to show up at crime scenes both here and in Mexico,"" Holder said. ""We are losing the battle to stop the flow of illegal guns to Mexico."" Holder defended his own actions, reminding the panel he called for the inspector general to examine the so-called Operation Fast and Furious and issued a directive that ""gun-alking"" was illegal and should never be repeated. The resulting report may be concluded before the end of the year. However, Holder stopped short of laying blame for the flawed operation. Last week, his assistant attorney general, Lanny Breuer, expressed ""regret"" for his failure to alert Holder about a similar earlier operation called ""Wide Receiver"" which had employed similar ATF ""gun-walking"" tactics during the Bush administration. At the hearing Tuesday, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said, ""It doesn't matter how many laws we pass if those responsible for enforcing them refuse to do their duty -- as was the case in Fast and Furious."" Grassley pressed Holder at the hearing about who had leaked a sensitive document to the press regarding a whistle-blower who had come forward with allegations of gun-walking. Grassley asked who was being held accountable. Holder refused to answer, but several hours later Grassley said Justice had provided him a document in a classified setting. Grassley revealed that former U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke, who resigned from his post, had leaked the document to the press. Still, the senator said, he is not satisfied. ""The Justice Department should not be allowed to continue to scapegoating the one person who has resigned,"" Grassley said, promising to pursue the matter further. Despite the disagreements, Holder pressed for congressional cooperation. He made a plea to the committee for strengthening the authority of the ATF to detect and disrupt illegal gun trafficking, and urged full funding for the ATF to combat gun-running. He added: ""I am determined to ensure that our shared concerns about Operation Fast and Furious lead to more than headline-grabbing Washington 'gotcha' games and cynical political point scoring,"" Holder concluded. Holder has the support of Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, chairman of the committee, who opened the hearing by reciting successes by the Justice Department under Holder's leadership. On Monday, Leahy tried to lower the heat on Holder by raising it on the Bush administration for Operation Wide Receiver. In a letter to the Justice Department inspector general, the senator asked whether the current investigation also will cover the Bush-era supervision of the ATF in 2006 when, he said, ""hundreds of weapons apparently moved beyond the custody and control of the ATF and possibly into Mexico and Arizona."" Leahy said that then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey may have been briefed in the case in 2007. Holder faces what is likely to be a much more hostile environment next month when he testifies before a House panel, where Republican Darrell Issa, R-California, will wield the gavel and control the questioning. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","DoJ officials took months to correct ""misleading"" info, Sen. Charles Grassley says .

"(CNN) -- Japan is set to make its mark in the skies with its first new commercial jet in more than 50 years, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, or MRJ. Since Japan's last commercial passenger plane was flying routes across the nation, the country has led the world in high-speed rail and established a significant aerospace industry -- but it's taken a back seat when it comes to original aircraft development. That's set to change with the narrow-bodied MRJ. It was rolled out at Saturday's launch event, complete with a stirring taiko drum performance at the Komaki Minami plant in Nagoya, where one of Mitsubishi's most famous aircraft was developed: the A6M ""Zero"" World War II fighter plane. The last commercial Japanese plane to operate was Mitsubishi's YS-11, a turboprop aircraft built between 1962 and 1972. It had been hoped the YS-11 would revive the Japanese aviation industry, but only 180 were sold, 99 of them in Japan. Obstacles overcome . The project to develop the MRJ began in 2008. Speaking at the event, Hideake Omiya, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, said numerous problems and obstacles had to be overcome during the plane's development. ""We had to be prepared to bear the risk that could jeopardize our company's foundation. Going forward this jet will fly to every corner of the world. This is the moment of dreams come true."" Composites are used in the construction of the MRJ, which will be powered by two Pratt & Whitney PW1200G engines. The jet will be available in two iterations, the 70-seat MRJ70 and 90-seat MRJ90. It has a pointed nose that wouldn't be out of place on a bullet train. ANA is the launch customer for the four-seats-abreast plane, with 15 firm orders. At the rollout event on Saturday, Shinichiro Ito, president and CEO of ANA, said the company is ""determined to help ensure the MRJ becomes an aircraft loved and appreciated by our passengers."" Five MRJs will begin test flights in the second quarter of 2015, with commercial operations set to launch in 2017. Going up against Embraer and Bombardier in the narrow-bodied-jet sector, Mitsubishi says six airlines have more than 400 MRJ planes on order or with options to purchase: ANA, JAL, Air Mandalay, Sky West, Trans States, and a relaunched Eastern Air Lines.","Mitsubishi's MRJ launched at event in Nagoya on Saturday .

"CNN -- Ben Steele hated the young man as soon as he saw him. Ben Steele at a Japanese coal mine prison camp in 1944. The man's almond-shaped eyes, dark hair and olive skin -- Steele had seen those Asian facial features before. He saw that face when he watched Japanese soldiers behead sick men begging for water, run over stumbling prisoners with tanks and split his comrades' skulls with rifle butts. ""Men died like flies,"" Steele says. ""I thought for a while I would never make it."" Steele, now 91, is one of the last survivors of the Bataan Death March. During World War II, the Japanese army forced American and Filipino prisoners of war on a march so horrific that the Japanese commander was later executed for war crimes. Steele returned home to Montana after the war to teach, but he still had something to learn. When he saw a young Japanese-American student seated in his class one day, he felt both anger and anguish. What, he wondered, do I do with all of the hate I've brought home with me? 'The worst war story' he ever heard . Steele's answer to that question can be found in the new book ""Tears in the Darkness,"" a searing depiction of the Bataan Death March. The book details how Steele found help through an unlikely source. But he would first have to survive one of the worst defeats in U.S. military history. In December 1941, Japanese forces attacked an army of American and Filipino soldiers in the Philippine Islands and forced them to surrender. They captured 76,000 prisoners, double what they had expected. The Japanese forced the POWs to march 66 miles under a tropical sun to a railway station for transport. They shot, bayoneted and beat to death prisoners who couldn't keep pace. At least 7,000 soldiers died during the march. More died later. The brutal conditions of the march contributed to the subsequent deaths of an estimated 25,000 Filipinos and 1500 Americans in Japanese prison camps, says Michael Norman, a Vietnam veteran who wrote ""Tears in the Darkness,"" with his wife, Elizabeth. ""It's the worst war story I've ever heard,"" Norman says. ""What they [the Japanese] did was monstrous."" Prisoners were forced to bury others alive and work as slave laborers; some were executed for sport. One Japanese soldier, who later became a Buddhist priest, told the authors that he is still haunted by what he did on Bataan. Some Filipinos who live today near the march's route say that they, too, cannot forget what happened, Elizabeth Norman says. ""They would tell us that when they lay awake at night, they thought they could still hear the trampling of the men's feet on the death march,"" she says. Why Steele survived . The death march was filled with villains, but the authors also found a hero: Steele. The march is told through his eyes and drawings. Steele was a cowboy from Montana who could ride a horse, rope cattle and shoot by the time he was 8 years old. ""I thought that if anybody gets out of here, I'm going to be one of them,"" says Steele, who was a 22-year-old Army Air Corps private when he was captured. At times, though, Steele wondered whether he was being too optimistic. He was bayoneted, starved and beaten. He was constantly ill, and his weight fell to 112 pounds. Steele found a way to preserve his mind even as his body wasted away: He drew. He started sketching pictures of what he saw during his captivity. ""I felt an obligation to show people what went on there,"" he says. Steele was released after three years of captivity when World War II ended. He returned to Billings, Montana, where he became an art professor at a state college. ""I had a lot of anger when I got home,"" Steele says. ""We were beaten for so long. I hated [the Japanese]."" Steele meets his 'nemesis' Steele's hatred smoldered for 15 years. It threatened to spill out into the open in 1960, when he walked into his classroom on the first day of the semester and saw a Japanese-American student. In ""Tears in the Darkness,"" Steele says that his ""heart hardened and filled with hate."" But he was so anguished by what he was feeling, he returned to his office after class to think. He told himself that the war was over; he wasn't a prisoner anymore, and he had to treat the Japanese-American student like anybody else, because he was an American, too. Then he did something else. He invited the student to his office for a talk. The student's name was Harry Koyama, and he, too, had been marked by the war. His family had been imprisoned at a ""relocation camp"" in Arizona during the war. Steele also discovered that he and Koyama had something else in common: a passion for drawing Montana's rural life. By the end of the semester, Koyama was one of Steele's best students. Steele says that talking to Koyama helped his hatred evaporate. ""We had a discussion and finally came to an understanding that we liked each other,"" he says. Today, Steele and Koyama remain in touch. ""We're the best of friends,"" Koyama tells CNN from his Montana art studio. ""We see each other regularly."" Koyama says he can't remember exactly what he and Steele talked about first, only that Steele had always treated him well. Steele did tell him later that their relationship helped him recover from the war, he says. ""I was just there,"" Koyama says. ""I just happened to be there for him to use my presence as a way to overcome his dark time."" Koyama says he is still amazed by Steele's survival story. ""Just to be a part of his life is an honor,"" Koyama says. Steele's voice is still strong and his mind sharp. He's been married to his wife, Shirley, for 57 years, and they have three children and six grandchildren. Steele says Bataan taught him to treasure small pleasures, like a drink of cool water and a warm bed at night. ""I'm thankful that I have a plateful of food,"" he says. ""I can remember when that plate was empty."" He still remembers tiny details from the death march as well. He constantly draws pictures of his friends and tormentors on Bataan. Their faces fill his sketchbooks. Steele's hate may be gone, but the death march lingers. ""I think about it every day,"" he says. ""It's in my mind, and I'll never get it out.""","Ben Steele recounts surviving the Bataan Death March in World War II .

"(CNN) -- Inaccurate, inconvenient, ill-conceived ... now add ""potentially life-threatening"" to the list of words being used to describe flaws in Apple's much maligned maps app. Police in Mildura, Australia are warning drivers to be careful about using Apple Maps to find the city, which the app has placed more than 40 miles (70 kilometers) away in the Outback. Calling it a ""potentially life-threatening issue,"" police say the mapping system lists Mildura, a city of 30,000 people, as being in the middle of Murray-Sunset National Park. Several motorists have had to be rescued by police from the park, which police say has no water supply and where temperatures can reach a blistering 46 degrees Celsius (114 Fahrenheit). ""Some of the motorists located by police have been stranded for up to 24 hours without food or water and have walked long distances through dangerous terrain to get phone reception,"" Mildura police said in a statement. ""Police have contacted Apple in relation to the issue and hope the matter is rectified promptly to ensure the safety of motorists travelling to Mildura. Anyone travelling to Mildura or other locations within Victoria should rely on other forms of mapping until this matter is rectified.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The CIA destroyed 92 videotapes of terror-suspect interrogations, according to a court document filed by the government on Monday. The disclosure marks the first time the specific number of tapes has been made public. A former CIA officer says the destroyed tapes showed harsh interrogations, including the use of waterboarding. The tapes were made in 2002 and showed the interrogations of two suspected al Qaeda leaders, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. According to former CIA officer John Kiriakou, some of the videos showed harsh interrogations, including the use of waterboarding, which is said to simulate drowning and is considered by most people to be a form of torture. Government officials have said the tapes were destroyed in November 2005 at the orders of Jose Rodriguez, then head of the CIA's National Clandestine Service, with the approval of NCS lawyers. The tape destruction is under investigation by John Durham, a federal prosecutor. The disclosure of the number of tapes involved came as part of a federal court proceeding in New York involving an American Civil Liberties Union motion to hold the CIA in contempt of court for destroying the tapes. Durham had requested and received a stay on the ACLU motion while his investigation was under way. Acting U.S. Attorney Lev Dassin wrote in a letter to Judge Alvin Hellerstein that Durham had not requested a continuation of the stay after it expired February 28. ""The CIA can now identify ... 92 videotapes were destroyed,"" wrote Dassin. He also told the court the CIA is collecting information describing each of the destroyed tapes, as well as written accounts of the tapes and the identities of the people who viewed or possessed the recordings. ""The CIA intends to produce all of the information requested to the court and to produce as much information as possible on the public record to the plaintiffs, Dassin wrote. But the ACLU, in a written statement, said the government's letter proves the CIA is in contempt. ""The large number of videotapes confirms the agency engaged in a systemic attempt to hide evidence of its illegal interrogations and to evade the court's order."" CIA spokesman George Little said the agency has cooperated with the Justice Department investigation. ""If anyone thinks it's agency policy to impede the enforcement of American law, they simply don't know the facts,"" he said in response to the ACLU. Then-CIA Director Mike Hayden wrote in a December 2007 memo to staff that the tapes were made as ""an internal check"" on the CIA's use of harsh interrogation techniques and the decision to destroy them was made ""only after it was determined they were no longer of intelligence value and relevant to any internal, legislative or judicial inquires."" Hayden said there were detailed written notes on the interrogations. The prosecutor's spokesman would not comment on the status of Durham's criminal investigation into the tape destruction. ""That investigation is ongoing so we are not commenting on any specific aspects of it,"" spokesman Tom Carson said.","Disclosure marks first time the specific number of tapes has been made public .

"(CNN) -- The news that Scotland has rejected independence from the rest of the United Kingdom -- by a relatively close 55-45 margin -- has reassured financial markets and many governments across the world. Not only does it secure the future (for now, at least) of one of the longest and most successful political unions in the world -- it also makes the prospect of a future British exit from the European Union less likely in coming years. Numerous world leaders, from U.S. President Barack Obama to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, had strongly asserted that it is in the best interests of the global community for the UK to stay together. This reflects the fact that, while no longer a great power, Britain continues to play a significant role on the world stage with wide-ranging international interests. However, given the significant size of the ""Yes"" vote, uncertainties remain, including the possibility of another Scottish independence referendum in the next decade or two. These unknowns could impact the UK's ability to continue to punch above its weight on the global stage and will leave residual concerns for allies. Internationally, it is the U.S., Europe and other key British allies which paid keenest attention to the vote outcome. This is because UK foreign policy has centered, in the post-war period, around the strategic importance of its alliance with the U.S. and integration with Europe. In Washington, where Obama indicated his opposition to Scottish independence repeatedly, there was perhaps the most significant apprehension of the outcome of yesterday's vote. Although America will be reassured by the result, some concerns will remain particularly about Britain's military capabilities, including the future of its nuclear arsenal, which is located in Scotland. This is particularly so in the context of the current 2015-16 UK Strategic Defence and Security Review, which will feature further cuts. Some in Washington (along with other allies) will remain apprehensive about the future of the UK Trident nuclear deterrent which is due for potential renewal in coming years. A further potential complication here is that Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond ran the ""Yes"" campaign on a pledge that Scotland would become a non-nuclear nation within five years under independence. Given the significant support for this proposition, and the fact that most of Britain's Trident submarines are based in Scotland, there may be growing pressure for relocation of these bases in coming years, despite the failure of the pro-independence movement to secure a majority. Such a move will be a very expensive, protracted process which the Ministry of Defence asserts will cost billions and take at least a decade. It is possible that this, allied with defence budget cutbacks, could significantly influence the British debate over renewal of Trident in coming years. Such uncertainty will prompt added anxiety in Washington and amongst some other UK allies, including NATO. In Brussels and European capitals, today's decision will be welcomed in many quarters too. Firstly, there is now a stronger likelihood that the United Kingdom will not now leave the EU in any ""in-out"" referendum. This is because Scots, in general, are more favorable toward continued membership of the EU than the English who account for a majority of the Britain's population. Thus, if Scotland had voted for independence, and didn't take part in any subsequent EU plebiscite, it would have been more likely that -- in a close vote -- that Britain could have left the EU. Secondly, the outcome will please leaders in those European countries where other significant separatist movements exist. Spain, for instance, faces pressure for a binding referendum for Catalans in coming months. A Scottish ""Yes"" vote could also have turbo-charged the separatist ambitions of Flemish campaigners in Belgium, the Northern League in Italy, and, to a lesser extent, French separatists. While allies across the world will be at least partially reassured, the relatively close vote -- not to mention the significant devolution of powers from London to Edinburgh that now seems likely -- means that the UK is likely to be transformed. Along with the possibility of another Scottish referendum in the next decade or two, this means that the territorial integrity of Britain cannot be taken for granted in the medium to long term. The continued possibility of the UK's dismemberment may well undermine its generally high international stature in the eyes of many across the world. This is because Britain's international reputation rests, in large part, upon its stability as a unified state, as Barack Obama has pointed out. These foreign concerns will be exacerbated by the fact that there will now be growing pressure in Wales and Northern Ireland for significant additional devolution. Many foreigners, especially key allies, will therefore wonder if one or both of these areas will also remain in the union too in the long term. Taken overall, today's vote will provide reassurance for key UK allies, especially the U.S. and Europe, despite lingering concerns about the future of Britain's military capability. While the UK's territorial integrity is assured in the short term, a second referendum in Scotland cannot be ruled out. READ MORE: Scotland says ""No"" to independence .

"(CNN) -- Caroline Wozniacki is known as one of the fittest players in tennis, but even the rejuvenated Dane is feeling anxious as she prepares to take part in the New York City Marathon in early November. Wozniacki admits to having nightmares about the grueling 26.2-mile race, which comes just a week after the season-ending WTA Finals conclude in Singapore. ""I dreamed one time that before I even got to the start line I was dead,"" Wozniacki laughs during an interview with CNN's Open Court. ""Or I dreamed that someone had to get me through the finish line in a wheelchair. ""So I don't know if I am that confident but I'm starting to get there. I definitely have a finish goal in mind but I want to keep it to myself."" Wozniacki is competing in the marathon for charity, capping a rollercoaster 2014 in which the former world No. 1 suffered an array of injuries and a high-profile split with top golfer Rory McIlroy before making her first grand slam final in five years at the U.S. Open. She then continued her resurgence with good form on the WTA Tour's Asian swing, clinching a place at the elite eight-woman championships for the first time since 2011. ""The running has definitely helped,"" she says. ""In the middle of the year I had a tough time outside the court and in my personal life. ""Just going for a run was nice to clear my mind and think about something else. Then you feel great about yourself as well. You get fit."" Still, if you think Wozniacki is crazy for deciding to take part this year after tennis' tiring 10-month hop around the world, you aren't alone. Her dad and fitness coach both thought the same. ""They said, 'You are crazy,' "" Wozniacki says. And while two-time grand slam winner Andy Murray plans to one day run a marathon, he won't do it until he is retired. ""That's an amazing effort, she's doing that while playing, because it takes a lot of training, a lot of hard work,"" he told reporters in Cincinnati in August. Wozniacki brought up the idea during a grass-court tournament in Eastbourne, England in June, where her career revival began. ""I was sitting there with my dad and my team and I was like, 'Hey, I'm going to run the New York City Marathon' and my dad was like, 'No you are not,' "" says Wozniacki, now ranked ninth. ""So I made the phone call right there and then to my agent John (Tobias) and I said, 'John, look up charities I can run for.' ""He was like, 'Funny joke' and I said, 'It's not a joke, I'm serious.' He came with a list that evening and I checked them out."" Wozniacki eventually settled on Team for Kids, which according to the New York Road Runners' website, provides ""free low-cost health and fitness programs to kids who would otherwise have little or no access to regular physical activity."" Sports has always been an important part of the Wozniacki family, with dad Piotr a former pro footballer, mom Anna a former volleyball player and brother Patrik also into football in Denmark. Running a marathon had always been on her ""bucket list,"" too, although it seems unlikely that Wozniacki would have participated this year had she and McIlroy not gone their separate ways. It was McIlroy who broke off the engagement. They were reportedly due to wed in November -- in New York. Wozniacki has stepped up her training while maintaining a full tennis schedule -- prior to losing to Serena Williams in last month's final at Flushing Meadows she told reporters how she believed it had helped her on-court fitness. She has run a half-marathon and through tennis may be equipped to deal with the ""mental battle"" faced by distance runners. ""I know the marathon is breathing down my neck so I know I need to get out and run and it's great for me,"" she says. ""I love it. ""I think running a marathon is very mental. It's definitely a mental battle with yourself out there and I think that's the same on the tennis court. ""Sometimes you are hitting the wall out there and you can't seem to get the points together but you just need to keep focusing, take one point at a time and somehow you manage to turn it around. I think it's the same in the marathon."" Her reward when she gets to the finish line? ""I told my friends and my manager to have chocolate and some sweets waiting for me,"" she said. ""We are definitely going to go out for a very unhealthy dinner afterwards.""","Caroline Wozniacki won't be done exercising when the tennis season is over .

"Rawalpindi, Pakistan  (CNN) -- At a frenzied Friday rally in this garrison city outside of Islamabad, thousands warned Pope Benedict XVI to keep his nose out of the debate over Pakistan's blasphemy laws. The demonstration came days after the Vatican called for Pakistan to repeal the controversial laws that say anyone who defiles the name of the Muslim prophet Mohammed should face the death penalty or life imprisonment. ""If you challenge the prophet, we will take revenge. It doesn't matter who does it,"" shouted a cleric on loudspeakers to thousands of cheering onlookers. Pakistan's blasphemy laws came into sharp focus when a security guard allegedly killed his boss Salman Taseer, the governor of Pakistan's Punjab province, who criticize the laws. Since the shooting, hardline religious groups have held demonstrations praising suspected killer Muhammad Mumtaz Qadri -- who Pakistan's Interior Minister says confessed to the killing -- calling him a hero and a defender of Islam. At Friday's rally, pictures of the the suspects's smiling face adorned scores of posters and a banner that covered the length of a truck. The banner also pictured a cleric who allegedly inspired Mumtaz Qadri to assassinate Taseer. The cleric is now wanted by police. Taseer, who was sprayed with more than 20 bullets last week, according to a medical clinic spokesman, had led an aggressive campaign to change Pakistan's blasphemy laws after what he called the wrongful conviction of a Pakistani Christian woman. The laws are often used to persecute minorities, Taseer had said. At the rally, many said Taseer wanted to repeal the blasphemy laws, which they called an attack on Islam. ""No doubt he was an agent,"" said protester Noor Ul Mustafa. ""After the pope's statement it's clear where he's getting orders from."" At the protest, Mumtaz Qadri's lawyer said his client should be set free because he was compelled to defend his faith. For now, the suspected assassin remains behind bars.","Demonstration held outside of Islamabad .

"Montevideo, Uruguay (CNN) -- The tiny faces pressed against the airport window stare in wonder at the aircraft waiting for them at the end of the sky bridge: this is the plane that will take them to a new life. Syrian refugee Nassar and his family - he has five sons and five daughters, aged from three to 22 -- fled their home in Idlib as the country's bloody civil war took hold. Now, after almost three years of fear and uncertainty, they are on the move again, flying more than 12,000km from their temporary base in Lebanon to a more permanent home on the other side of the world. ""Returning to Syria is not an option,"" Nassar told CNN a day before he began the daunting 23-hour journey to Uruguay, where he and his children are being resettled at the invitation of the country's President Jose Mujica. ""I'm excited to go to Uruguay but I'm also nervous. I'm going because I want my kids to continue their education,"" he said. ""Traveling to the other side of the world to find a new chance to live, this is not easy,"" said Uruguay's Human Rights Secretary Javier Miranda, who accompanied the group, along with a CNN team. ""They are very brave to choose a new destiny for their lives because they want to educate their kids with dignity. They deserve our help and they deserve the opportunity."" Uruguay has offered to take in up to 120 refugees to help with the humanitarian crisis sparked by the conflict in Syria. Nassar and his family are among the first 42 - five families -- to make the move. A second group is expected to follow by February 2015. Together, they will live at Hogar San Jose, a Catholic home on the outskirts of the capital, Montevideo, for two months, learning Spanish and adjusting to a new culture before moving on. First though, they have to get there. It's a lengthy and life-changing journey - from Beirut, via Frankfurt and Buenos Aires - and one filled with mixed emotions. After one final briefing from Pierre King, operations manager at the International Organization for Migration, which has organized the trip, and a last medical check-up, they are cleared to set off. For most of the refugees, it is their first time on a plane, so there is an air of excitement as well as of apprehension about what awaits them on arrival in Montevideo. Nassar's eldest sons, Mohammed and Bassel are keen to learn all they can about their soon-to-be-adopted home, peppering me with questions when we first meet. ""What is life like there?"" ""What is the nature like?"" ""How can we live there and adapt quickly? How can we make friends?"" ""What is the weather like there?"" ""Which places can we visit?"" They are all too aware that their first challenge will be the fact that they don't speak Spanish, but both young men are desperate to continue their education, having been forced to abandon their university studies when they left Idlib. Inevitably, the conversation turns to football; the brothers say they are looking forward to playing and watching it in Uruguay. Their favorite players? Neymar, Messi, and -- of course -- Luis Suarez. As the plane makes its way across the vast South American continent, Nassar studies the flight's interactive map on a screen. ""Hours have passed and we are still flying above Brazil!"" he says in amazement at the size and scale of the countries passing below. After a brief stop in Buenos Aires - a chance for the refugees to stretch their legs after more than 19 hours flying - they are finally on the last leg of the journey, a short hop to Montevideo. The children, by now familiar with the in-flight entertainment system, keep themselves occupied as they near their destination. Two of their fellow passengers, Uruguayans, greet the children with hugs and kisses after realizing who they are. ""We are very happy to welcome them to our country,"" they told CNN. Eventually, tired but with broad smiles on their faces, the enthusiastic group of refugees emerges from the Air France flight at Montevideo's Carrasco International Airport. They are greeted by President Mujica after their arrival. Mujica later told reporters he hopes more countries will follow Uruguay's example and offer homes to Syria's refugees. ""We must insist that the world moves in this direction; we can't continue with statements on human rights and [saying] that we support human rights if later we don't put our words into action, above all for the children."" According to the U.N., there are more than 1.1 million Syrian refugees like Nassar's family registered in Lebanon, while the country's population is just over 4 million people. Lebanon's Minister of Social Affairs, H.E. Rashid Derbas, and UNHCR's Representative in Lebanon, Ninette Kelley, recently called for renewed investment in Lebanese infrastructure to help the country manage the influx of refugees from the Syrian conflict. ""Lebanon today faces an unprecedented challenge to manage both its own population and Syrian refugees,"" said Kelley. ""The presence of over 1.5 million Syrians across Lebanon has directly affected the public and service sectors at the national scale,"" Derbas explained. ""From Akkar all the way to the South, our towns and villages have been at the forefront of the humanitarian response to an incessantly escalating crisis. The inhabitants of these communities have opened their hearts and homes to the refugees. Therefore, the projects undertaken since 2011 have brought much needed breathing space to our communities and improved our lives and the lives of our Syrian kin."" Walking from the plane towards his new home, one of the children proudly showed off his football shirt, bearing Suarez's number 9. At last, he and his family have reached their final goal: a new country and a new life, leaving memories of war behind.","Five Syrian refugee families have been flown to Uruguay to begin a new life there .

"(CNN) -- Home hope Andy Murray will play six-time champion Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final as both made tennis history Friday. Murray became the first British man to reach the final in 74 years after seeing off Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 in the second semifinal. Bunny Austin was the last home player to achieve the feat in 1938. Earlier Friday, Federer beat top seed and defending champion Novak Djokovic in four sets to reach a record eighth final. If Federer claims the title Sunday he will equal the record of seven for the Open Era, held by American great Pete Sampras and extend his grand slam tally to 17. Victory for fourth seed Murray would give Britain its first male grand slam winner since the legendary Fred Perry in 1936. He had to battle for nearly three hours on Centre Court before ending the brave challenge of fifth seed Tsonga, who mounted a sterling recovery after trailing by two sets. But the 25-year-old Murray finally worked two match points as he led 6-5 in the fourth set and dramatically took his chance. A forehand winner was initially called out, but Murray challenged the decision and was proved to be right, sealing his victory. An emotional Murray hugged Tsonga before moving into the middle of the court to give his trademark ""fingers-in-the-air"" gesture, the tearful Scot looking to the sky. ""There's a bit of relief, excitement. It's tough to explain, it was such a close match,"" Murray told BBC Sport. ""Both of us had chances, I was up a break, he came back, then he had break points at 4-4 in the fourth and I managed to hang tough enough,"" he added. Federer had rolled back the years to dispatch world number one Djokovic 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 in just two hours 19 minutes. ""Obviously I'm ecstatic, it was a great match and I was able to play some fantastic tennis,"" Federer told BBC Sport after his victory. The 30-year-old Federer had never lost a semifinal at Wimbledon and maintained that streak with a peerless performance against the Serbian, who has dominated the men's game since the start of last year. After the opening two sets were shared, the third set proved pivotal with both men having chances to break their opponent's service. At 4-5 down, Djokovic allowed Federer a set point which he took after a thrilling exchange to take a two sets to one lead. ""The first two sets went really quickly and the third was key to the match. ""I was able to step it up and get a bit lucky maybe,"" Federer added. A single break in the fourth set was enough to leave the third seed to serve for his place in the final and he completed victory on his first match point. Federer has not won a grand slam title for two and a half years since his 2010 Australian Open success where he beat Murray in the final. If he beats the Scot again Sunday he will also return to the top spot in the world rankings.","Andy Murray becomes first British man to reach Wimbledon final for 74 years .

"Hamid Dabashi is the author of ""Iran: A People Interrupted."" He is Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York. His Web site is http://www.hamiddabashi.com/. Hamid Dabashi says imposing more sanctions on Iran, with its volatile politics, would be a mistake. (CNN) -- In a recent congressional hearing, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman called the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act ""a sword of Damocles over the Iranians"" that will soon come down if President Obama's diplomatic overture did not show signs of success by the fall. That sword is no mere metaphor and might kill more than the president's diplomatic overture. The hearing came as demonstrators around the globe joined Iranians protesting the brutal crackdown of the uprising against the beleaguered regime. Meanwhile, a kangaroo court began the trial of the leading reformists as the contested second-term presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was about to be summarily inaugurated. Of the six invited panelists at this hearing, three -- Patrick Clawson of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Orde Kittrie of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute -- maintained that the United States should impose more severe economic sanctions on Iran. Suzanne Maloney of the Brookings Institution and Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace were counseling that Congress wait until ""the dust has settled"" over the current crisis before imposing such sanctions. Abbas Milani of the Hoover Institution, however, upped the ante and said that the United States and other nations should impose multilateral ""crippling sanctions"" and not merely ""half-baked"" measures. Although the paramount item on the agenda of the hearing was the Islamic Republic's nuclear program, the key question of the current post-electoral crisis was obviously on everyone's mind. Sadjadpour informed the committee that ""many members of the opposition and the population actually are starting to come around. Their views towards sanctions have changed. They're not in a position to publicly articulate that right now. ... They're starting to see value in it,"" a view that Milani seconded. The Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act would allow the president to take new measures against Iran by imposing sanctions on the export of gasoline to the country. The spirit of the meeting could not have been lost on any of the participants when Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-New Jersey, invoked the example of Nazi Germany in criticizing Iran's use of technology to block human rights, thus advocating new and harsher sanctions, or when he added that if sanctions did not work, Iranians ""need to know what's coming next."" As to what exactly was to come next, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-California, told the panel, ""we can do more than just sanctions,"" meaning advocating covert support for Iranian opposition forces ""so that they will have the material well-being ... to take on that government themselves."" From there, Rep. John Boozman, R-Arkansas, proceeded to argue that he would support Israeli bombing of Iran. Kittrie proposed that in that event, it would be better for the United States to carry out any military action because ""we have the right capacity,"" although he described that as not a ""good option."" From imposing ""crippling sanctions"" to initiating ""covert operations,"" all the way down to military attack by Israel and/or the United States amounts to a familiar scenario that has a very simple and coded antecedent in modern Iranian political culture: the CIA-engineered coup d'état of 1953, for which President Obama apologized during his speech at Cairo University in June 2009. Contrary to the vision and wisdom of the president, the political machinations of the U.S. Congress and the flawed advice offered by this group of panelists amount to a belligerent threat against the regime. That will exacerbate its self-righteous warring posture and have chilling consequences for the grass-roots civil rights movement inside Iran. To avoid that dangerous route, we need to make a distinction between the nuclear ambitions of the Islamic Republic and the growing civil rights movement in Iran. So far as the nuclear issue is concerned, the only viable and legitimate way to make sure the Islamic Republic does not develop a nuclear weapons program remains a multilateral approach through the International Atomic Energy Agency and geared toward a regional disarmament. This approach must begin by fully recognizing the fact that pursuing a peaceful nuclear program is widely supported by the Iranian people, even by those who regard the election as invalid. Any unilateral approach by the United States that categorically disregards this fact and overlooks the crucial question of regional nuclear disarmament is frightfully reminiscent of the lead-up to the Iraq war and is bound to fail. So far as the emerging civil rights movement is concerned, there is absolutely not a shred of evidence that any major or even minor opposition leader -- from Mir Hossein Moussavi to Mehdi Karrubi to Mohammad Khatami, or any of their related political organs or legitimate representatives -- has ever uttered a word that could possibly be interpreted as calling for or endorsing any sort of economic sanction against Iran, let alone ""crippling sanctions."" As in the Iraqi case, imposition of economic sanctions on Iran will have catastrophic humanitarian consequences, while it will even more enrich and empower such critical components of the security and military apparatus as the Pasdaran and the Basij. The two organizations work like a massive corporate conglomerate and have major control over the export-import components of both the official and the unofficial economy. It will also give them a welcome opportunity to accuse the opposition of cooperation with ""the Enemy"" and initiate even a harsher crackdown of the opposition, and perhaps even move toward a full-fledged military coup. The fact of the matter is that the nascent civil rights movement in Iran, which can use the moral support of ordinary Americans, is an amorphous uprising still very much in its earliest, formative, stages. No one, particularly a panel that has a very thin and dubious claim on scholarship on Iran, can speak for it in any certain terms, especially in its having asked the United States to lead the imposition of new economic sanctions on Iranians. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.","Hamid Dabashi: Congressional hearing raised prospect of sanctions vs. Iran .

Haven't heard of the band Something Ridiculous? They are legends in their time, which would be Sunday nights at the Living Room Lounge in Brooklyn. That's ""Rock Band"" Night. Hu and fellow members Alex Hedquist, 25, Darce Grillo, 19, Saori Tsujimoto, 21, and E. Pena, 21, even made their own T-shirts. ""When you do 'Guitar Hero,' you're like a comedian -- on your own,"" said Living Room Lounge bartender Gerard Grillo, who brings the game to the bar on Sundays and projects it onto a large screen. ""Now you have three other people to act foolish with."" Karaoke's successor . Bar nights devoted to music games are popping up from Brooklyn to the Bay Area. ""Guitar Hero"" Night at the Living Room Lounge brought in 60 people on Sunday nights, estimates Darce Grillo, the bartender's son; with ""Rock Band,"" it's about 80. Arshan Sadri, a restaurant worker, slips into a showbiz alter ego as soon as he straps on the stringless guitar replica, urging three strangers to join hands and yell, ""Let's go, band!"" ""You're forming a fake band -- that's what you do,"" says Sadri, calling the game ""the best part of karaoke, adding in a drummer and guitars."" Players at the Lounge shred on electric anthems such as the Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter,"" Mountain's ""Mississippi Queen"" and Blue Oyster Cult's ""Don't Fear the Reaper."" Or, at least, they appear to play. Guitarists press colored notes on the neck of the ""instrument"" to correspond with the colored bars descending on the video monitor. They press a strum key with the other hand to ""hit"" the note before it disappears. Drummers pound in syncopation with a color code, and singers perform with a real microphone as the words stream across the screen, their voices blending with the real artists'. They pat the microphone to simulate a tambourine. Tsujimoto of Something Ridiculous said ""Rock Band"" demands a degree of dexterity similar to ""Dance Dance Revolution,"" in which participants match dance steps with flashing colored lights. ""Rock Band"" doesn't quite put one onstage at Madison Square Garden. Computer-generated characters do the prancing and preening. Players can choose from among such archetypes as the muscular punk, the earthy babe and the mop-topped pretty boy. Strong performances earn bands a classier virtual tour bus and better venues in the video game. Something for everyone . The fantasy is all some need. The newly hooked Mary Tchamkina, 24, says it fulfills her long-held dream of being able to play the drums. She had never tried a video game before ""Rock Band."" Others like that the game begs for participation in a social setting -- in the living room or garage with friends, or at a bar with strangers. Even though bands can compete, the vibe has been more communal than cutthroat at the Living Room Lounge. ""It's all about fun as long as people are feeling it,"" Darce Grillo says. ""If you compete, you don't have fun."" Roy Tumminia, a 25-year-old Staten Island sanitation worker, plays ""Rock Band"" with colleagues between garbage runs. Jared Fletcher, Tchamkina's boyfriend, used ""Rock Band"" in his apartment as a perk when advertising for a prospective roommate. The explosion of virtual performance is ""bringing a whole new crowd into the rock scene,"" says Tumminia. ""Rock Band"" and its ""Guitar Hero"" forebears are attracting non-gamers as well, says Brian Crecente, editor of the gaming blog Kotaku.com and a judge at the Spike TV Video Game Awards. He hosted a charity event in Denver where ""Rock Band"" was the featured entertainer. ""It's so big because it gives people a chance who do not have musical talent to play like they have musical talent,"" Crecente says. ""It tricks you into thinking you're pulling off that amazing solo."" E-mail to a friend . LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The leader of a shark tour whose customer was mauled to death Saturday was warned that his practice of allowing people to swim close to hungry sharks could lead to tragedy, a colleague said. Markus Groh -- an Austrian lawyer -- died after being gnawed during a dive led by Jim Abernethy's south Florida company. Groh, 49, died from loss of blood resulting from the shark attack near the Bahamas, The Miami-Dade Medical Examiner's Office said. Neal Watson, a president of the Bahamas Diving Association, told CNN he implored Abernethy to stop what Watson considered a dangerous practice: Cageless shark dives specifically targeting dangerous shark species. ""I hate to say I told you so out of respect for the victim's family, but I've always said it wasn't a matter of whether something like this would happen, it was when,"" he said. Abernethy did not return phone calls from CNN seeking comment. The shark dives are advertised on the Web site of his company, Jim Abernethy's Scuba Adventures. ""Abernethy has been swimming with sharks almost his entire life, and is a pioneer in diving with tiger and great hammerhead sharks,"" the site proclaims. ""No one can get you closer, or get you the best photographic opportunities!"" In shark-dive excursions, dead fish and fish entrails are used to attract the sharks and bring them close to the divers. Cageless dives put divers and sharks in close proximity, without a metal underwater cage protecting the diver. Watson told CNN he also offers a cageless shark tourist experience in the Bahamas, but only with less dangerous species: Caribbean reef sharks, blacktip sharks, blacknose sharks, nurse sharks and silky sharks. Shark feeding was banned in Florida in 2001, so dive operators take customers out to Bahamian waters, Watson said. Watson said that he had sent a letter to members of the Bahamas Diving Association in July 2007 urging them to stop cageless dives with about 10 dangerous species. He said he wrote the letter to everybody, even though Abernethy is the only dive operator he knows of who does it. The letter read in part, ""We recommend all operations immediately cease and desist conducting open-water, non-cage shark diving experiences with known species of potentially dangerous sharks such as tiger sharks, bull sharks, hammerhead sharks, lemon sharks, and mako sharks. ... Purposeful feeding or interaction with these species without a proper shark cage is highly discouraged."" Watson said the letter was copied to the Bahamas government, which he said has not outlawed the practice. Abernethy did not respond, Watson said.

"(CNN) -- Months after he told off a passenger over a plane's public address system, a former JetBlue flight attendant told CNN's Larry King on Tuesday that ""a perfect storm of bad manners"" triggered his much ballyhooed outburst. ""It was a stressful, rushed (plane) full of harried carriers ... and a harried crew,"" Steven Slater said in his first extensive interview since the August incident. ""I was angry at all of it. I call it the perfect storm of bad manners that created this situation, including my own."" Slater talked to CNN exactly one week after reaching a deal with prosecutors and pleading guilty to second-degree attempted criminal mischief, a felony, and fourth-degree attempted criminal mischief, a misdemeanor. Under terms of the deal, he must enter a yearlong mental health program, which includes treatment for substance abuse, and take certain medications. Slater must also pay a $10,000 fine to JetBlue for the cost of repairing or replacing the chute. That's a steep cost given that Slater earned $9,700 last year after taking time off to help his ailing mother, said his publicist Howard Bragman. But Slater said he was happy to avoid a trial that, as long as he isn't arrested again, keeps him out of jail. ""I don't look very good in horizontal stripes,"" he said. Slater has signed with a book agent, through the William Morris agency, to work with a co-writer on a story documenting his 20 years in the travel business. The book is tentatively titled ""Cabin Pressure,"" Bragman said. According to Slater, the incident occurred during the third and final leg of a day of flying for him and his crew, capping three straight days on the road and in the air. While on the ground in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Slater said his forehead got cut as he worked with a woman trying to wedge an oversized bag into an overhead bin. He said most of the brief Pittsburgh to New York City flight was largely uneventful, though some passengers later said he'd been rude to them en route. Slater said Tuesday, ""I wouldn't deny that one bit. I'm sure my service was less than stellar that day."" After the plane landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, Slater said the passenger with the large bag -- which had to be checked as it wouldn't fit in the overhead bin -- began berating him. With the PA microphone already in hand, he said that he thanked the ""respectful"" passengers on board but not the woman who Slater said had called him a curse word. Slater said he then grabbed a few beers from the beverage cart, looked outside, opened the emergency evacuation slide and slid down. He described his thoughts at the time as a combination of ""pure rage"" and serenity and clarity that ""I didn't need to do this anymore."" ""I was just thinking, 'I'm free, I'm finally free,' "" he said. ""It was a nice, hot beach day, and I had a couple of cold beers."" Slater hopped in his car and drove to his Belle Harbor, New York, home, where police came and arrested him a few hours later. A self-described ""recovering alcoholic,"" Slater said he had ""a few sips"" of an alcoholic beverage while on the late-morning flight, but he denied he was drunk. Almost hours after it became public, the episode became a national phenomenon. His ""take this job and shove it"" sentiment stirred support from hundreds of thousands of fans online, on talk radio, on late-night talk shows and elsewhere, as well as strong opinions about Slater, travel stress and the perceived growing rudeness of people. The son of an American Airlines pilot and flight attendant, Slater said that he'd been a flight attendant for 20 years for TWA, Delta and ultimately JetBlue before that airline suspended him after this summer's incident. Being a flight attendant had changed significantly in that time, he claimed, becoming more stressful, less satisfying and less rewarding -- for people like himself as well as passengers. Slater said he was set to work a return flight for TWA Flight 800 before it crashed in July 1996 minutes after taking off from New York. He got counseling after that crash, which killed several friends, and after the September 11 terrorist attacks. ""The days of the pillbox hat and the white gloves are long gone,"" he said. ""I think of myself as someone who reached the end of the rope and may not have handled it the best way ... but I'm moving forward."" Slater himself says he was taken aback by the media frenzy and found humor in some of the potshots. ""It's surreal, it's very strange,"" he said. ""I kind of remind myself that (Steven Slater) has been a two-dimensional media, Internet-created figure. This is my chance to become a little more three-dimensional.""

VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Viewer discretion advised. London, England (VBS.TV) -- As well as going to exotic places like Liberia, North Korea and Sudan, VBS also makes films in our London office's beloved United Kingdom. The latest one was made by myself and a young filmmaker called Leo Leigh. Leo's father is Mike Leigh, who's made films like ""Naked,"" starring David Thewlis. In spring of last year we discovered that the small South Wales city of Swansea had recorded an 180 percent rise in registered heroin users. This happened in just four years, with young people making up the bulk of the increase. It used to be one of the biggest ports in the world, but when Margaret Thatcher helped bring about the end of heavy industry in Britain, the social implications for places like Swansea were dire. Funnily enough, it was Thatcher who signed off on a program that meant heroin addicts would be given access to free, sterile needles. This was after she'd closed down the mines, docks, and factories. Mass unemployment and heroin addiction have always made fine bedfellows. See the rest of Swansea Love Story . And so we went to Swansea and lived with a gang of young addicts for a few months and found out just why addiction to heroin in Britain continues to rise at such an alarming rate. We found out about love, death, the organized sexual abuse of children and the collapse of the family. We stumbled into a race riot, met old sailors, and listened to a wonderful Welsh male choir. We learned about why dragging yourself out of addiction is such a struggle, especially if you're a teenager who's the product of two generations of heroin addicts and whose great-grandfathers were miners, sailors, and steelworkers. Mainly, though, we filmed the young people from Swansea who make up the statistics about drug use in modern Britain. The poor young souls in tattered clothes you cross the street to avoid? This film is all about them. We called it Swansea Love Story.","The city of Swansea saw a 180 percent increase in heroin use in just four years .

"(CNN) -- The nation's oldest Army armor unit at Fort Carson in Colorado remained in lockdown for a second day Friday, after the post began investigating ""the unauthorized removal of government property,"" the military said. The lockdown applies to the 1st Battalion 66th Armor Regiment ""Iron Knights,"" an Army spokesman said. ""The 66th Armor Regiment is the oldest Armor unit in the United States Army, tracing it's lineage to the beginning of the Tank Service in February 1918,"" its Facebook page says. Fort Carson chief of media Dani Johnson declined to elaborate Friday on the type of property allegedly removed. ""This type of lockdown is a unit lockdown, which is at a commander's discretion,"" Johnson said. Between 500 to 750 soldiers are affected ""at most"" at the 26,000-soldier installation near Colorado Springs, Johnson said. ""So you're talking about a very small impact,"" Johnson said. This type of lockdown is not common, a spokesman said. The measure means that soldiers remain on-duty working on the base instead of being allowed to go home, CNN affiliate KKTV reported. The property purportedly missing was from that unit, and base authorities searched outgoing vehicles Thursday to make sure property was not being removed from the base, the affiliate reported.","""Iron Knights"" at Fort Carson remains in lockdown after property is missing .

"(CNN) -- The California shooting rampage began in a parking lot of a $56-a-night motel outside downtown Sacramento when two sheriff's deputies checked on a suspicious car there. By the time the spree was over, authorities said, the suspects killed two sheriff's deputies in two counties, wounded a third deputy, attempted three car carjackings and shot one of those drivers in the head -- all during a span of six hours Friday, prompting school lockdowns and a massive manhunt. The dragnet was successful: Marcelo Marquez, 34, of Salt Lake City, Utah, was arrested Friday after police found him in a home in Auburn, about 30 miles from the initial shooting, authorities said. Also arrested was Jannelle Monroy, 38, of Sacramento County, who was allegedly with Marquez during the rampage, authorities said. Killed was Sacramento County Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, a 15-year veteran with a wife and two daughters. The other slain officer was Placer County Deputy Michael David Davis Jr., 42, an 18-year veteran with a wife and four children. Davis died exactly 26 years later to the day that his father, a Riverside County sheriff's deputy, was killed in the line of duty, authorities said. The wounded deputy, Jeff Davis of Placer County, was shot in the arm and later treated and released, and the driver, Anthony Holmes, 38, was in serious condition in a hospital, according to authorities and CNN affiliates. ""A one-man crime spree"" The two suspects' motive remained a mystery on Saturday as authorities continued their investigation and weighed what charges to file. Investigators will take weeks in putting together the string of crime scenes, police said. Officials believe Marquez is responsible for all the shootings, according to reports. ""This guy was on a one-man crime spree today. He has no idea of the damage he did,"" Placer County Sheriff's Office spokesman Dena Erwin told reporters after Marquez's arrest. Added Placer County Sheriff Ed Bonner at a news conference: ""I think there's those people who would say, 'You know what, I wish you'd killed him.' ""Now, that's not who we are. We are not him. We did our job,"" Bonner told reporters. Shot in the jaw . Events began shortly before 10:30 a.m. when Oliver and his partner found themselves being fired upon by at least one of the suspects in a vehicle in the parking lot of Motel 6, authorities said. The gunfire surprised Oliver, who wasn't able to fire a shot, but his partner did return fire, and the suspects fled, authorities said. Oliver was shot in the forehead, police said. Then a total of three attempted carjacking occurred, two of them successful, according to CNN affiliate KCRA, citing authorities. The first was Holmes' vehicle, but he fought the carjacking attempt, police said. He was shot in the jaw, CNN affiliate KOVR reported. ""Anthony Holmes is a strong guy,"" friend Tyrone Murphy told KOVR. ""He wouldn't let someone take his car, but officially the guy had a gun, and he couldn't beat the bullet."" Holmes fell back into his car, police said. ""By his falling back (into his car), that could explain why the suspect was unable to carjack that vehicle,"" Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones said. Final carjacking . The two suspects carjacked a Mustang and ditched it. They then carjacked a red Ford F-150 truck and drove to Placer County, KCRA reported. Another gunfire erupted again in Auburn, when two Placer County sheriff's deputies were wounded, police said. Authorities arrested Monroy in or near the hijacked truck, and Marquez allegedly ran from the scene, said Erwin. All Auburn schools were locked down while police hunted for Marquez, authorities said. Placer High School's homecoming football game on Friday was postponed until Saturday, KCRA reported. A SWAT team, police armored vehicles and gun-drawing officers formed a perimeter around the neighborhood and set up checkpoints to inspect the car trunks of passing motorists, the Sacramento Bee reported. ""It looks like a TV show around here,"" Hazel Haase, who lived next door to the home where Marquez allegedly was hiding, told the newspaper by telephone during the siege. The owner of the home where Marquez was found helped police by drawing a floor plan, the newspaper reported. Marquez was arrested without putting up a struggle and was taken to a hospital with a gunshot wound to his hand, according to a CNN affiliate. His ID was found on the dashboard of one of the vehicles he allegedly carjacked, KCRA reported.","One deputy is killed by surprise gunfire from suspicious car in a motel parking lot .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A Turkish doctor arrested in an investigation into an alleged human organ smuggling ring protested his innocence Wednesday. ""There is no such crime. There is no organ trade,"" Yusuf Ercin Sonmez told reporters outside a courthouse, according to Turkey's semiofficial Anatolian news agency.  ""There can't be evidence for something that doesn't exist,"" he added. He was arrested Tuesday in Istanbul's Kartal district, an officer with the financial crimes department of Istanbul Police told CNN. Sonmez, 53, was the subject of an Interpol arrest warrant issued by the District Court of Pristina in Kosovo.  The offenses listed by Interpol: crimes against life and health, people smuggling, trafficking and illegal immigration. Sonmez was questioned by a prosecutor for about two hours Wednesday, then sent to a criminal court ""with the prosecutor's demand for his arrest for 'organized organ trading,' "" the Anatolian news agency said.  Sonmez was then released by the court pending trial. Last month, European authorities charged in a report that executives who control Kosovo may have stolen organs when the Kosovo Liberation Army was fighting Serbian forces in the late 1990s. Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci called it ""a political accusation based on no facts or proof"" and ""pure fabrication."" The report said Thaci, a former leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army, was the ""boss"" of a prominent faction in the militia that ""apparently wrested control"" of ""illicit criminal enterprises"" from rivals across the border in Albania. ""Numerous indications seem to confirm that ... organs were removed from some prisoners ... to be taken abroad for transplantation,"" read the report. It suggested that illegal organ trafficking continued after the war ended. Thaci said in December that he was looking into all legal and political possibilities to correct what he saw as the report's inaccuracies. Dick Marty of the Council of Europe, author of the draft report, said nearly 1,900 people who disappeared during the conflict still have not been found, and another 500 disappeared after NATO troops arrived in June 1999. The report is based partially on investigations by European Union officials and was written for the Council of Europe's Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights. European Union officials in Kosovo have said that anyone with concrete evidence of war crimes or organized crime should come forward. Kosovo was a province of Serbia but declared independence in 2008. About 70 countries have recognized the declaration, but Serbia does not, and international organizations including the United Nations and the European Union continue to have administrators in Kosovo. The Council of Europe, an organization with 47 member countries, seeks to promote democracy and human rights.

"NEWTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- For Laura Geraghty, April 1, 2009, started out just as any other day. It was sunny but cool, she remembers. Laura Geraghty was shocked 21 times before she came back from cardiac arrest with tales of the afterlife. The mother of two, also a grandmother, was at her job, driving a school bus for the Newton Public School District in suburban Boston, Massachusetts. Her passengers, special-needs children, were wheelchair-bound. Seemingly in good health and in good spirits, Geraghty was finishing up her late-morning run, transporting a student and teacher back to Newton South High School, when she realized she was in trouble. As she was pulling into the school parking lot, she began having sharp stomach pains. She was able to park her bus, but she kept feeling worse. The pain ""went right up my arm and into my chest, and I said, 'Uh-oh, I'm having a heart attack,' "" she said. The teacher ran from the bus to get help. Newton South's nurse, Gail Kramer, and CPR instructor Michelle Coppola arrived moments later with the school's new automated external defibrillator. Geraghty, barely conscious, was fading fast. She was weak and having trouble breathing. And then she went into full cardiac arrest. ""Her eyes were wide, and all of a sudden she stopped talking to us,"" Coppola said. ""I grabbed the two pads, stuck them on her, started it up, and I'd say within 20 seconds, she had her first shock."" Coppola and Kramer performed CPR while they waited for paramedics.  See an expert give a quick lesson in CPR » . At that point, Geraghty says, her body died. She remembers watching the scene unfold -- as if from above. ""I floated right out of my body. My body was here, and I just floated away. I looked back at it once, and it was there."" Geraghty says she saw deceased loved ones, her mother and her ex-husband. ""It was very peaceful and light and beautiful. And I remember like, when you see someone you haven't seen in a while, you want to hug them, and I remember trying to reach out to my ex-husband, and he would not take my hand. And then they floated away."" Next, she says, she was overwhelmed by ""massive energy, powerful, very powerful energy."" ""When that was happening, there were pictures of my son and my daughter and my granddaughter, and every second, their pictures flashed in my mind, and then I came back."" What Geraghty had was a near-death experience, fairly common in people who go into sudden cardiac arrest. Geraghty was down for 57 minutes. No blood pressure, no pulse, no oxygen, no blood flow. She was shocked 21 times before she finally came back with tales of the afterlife. According to the Near Death Experience Research Foundation, nearly 800 near-death experiences happen every day in the United States. Dr. Kevin Nelson, a neurologist in Lexington, Kentucky, studies near-death experiences and says they're not imagined. The explanation, he says, lies in the brain itself. ""These are real experiences. And they're experiences that happen at a time of medical crisis and danger,"" Nelson said. Humans have a lot of reflexes that help keep us alive, part of the ""fight or flight"" response that arises when we're confronted with danger. Nelson thinks that near-death experiences are part of the dream mechanism and that the person having the experience is in a REM, or ""rapid eye movement,"" state. ""Part of our 'fight or flight' reflexes to keep us alive includes the switch into the REM state of consciousness,"" he said. During REM sleep, there is increased brain activity and visual stimulation. Intense dreaming occurs as a result. And the bright light so many people claim to see? ""The activation of the visual system caused by REM is causing the bright lights,"" Nelson said. And the tunnel people speak of, he says, is lack of blood flow to the eye. ""The eye, the retina of the eye, is one of the most exquisitely sensitive tissues to a loss of blood flow. So when blood flow does not reach the eye, vision fails, and darkness ensues from the periphery to the center. And that is very likely causing the tunnel effect."" Nelson is doing studies now to prove that the same effect results from fainting. ""The most common cause of near-death experience in my research group is fainting. Upwards of 100 million Americans have fainted. That means probably tens of millions of Americans have had these unusual experiences."" But Geraghty says this was no dream. ""I know I went someplace else. I know I went someplace else other than here."" Dr. Bill O'Callahan, the emergency room doctor who shocked her back to life, agrees. ""Cynics out there would say and agnostics would say that's phenomenon that comes from a dying brain. I think that's hogwash. I firmly believe that people experience these events."" Cheating Death: Back from the dead . Bob Schriever, co-founder of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Association, was refereeing a high school football game seven years ago when he went into cardiac arrest, died and was revived. He, too, questions the dream explanation. ""Why are so many people dreaming the same thing? How can so many people, and there's hundreds of thousands of people who have experienced this, how can we all be dreaming the same thing and describe the exact same thing?"" Schriever says these experiences are so profound that only someone who has gone through them can truly understand. Seven years later, he is still consumed with his own near-death experience. ""I think about that every morning when I wake up, first thing, during the day, I don't know how many times and every night before I fall asleep. I think about that. People do not understand or appreciate what we go through."" Scientist uses poison gas to suspend life . For Geraghty, it's a daily struggle to put the pieces back together again. ""I've been someplace that not everybody can go, and there's not a lot of people you can sit down and have that conversation with,"" Geraghty said. ""My own daughter tells me, 'It's freaky, Mom.' I've literally lost friends over this the minute they hear it."" Tweet your own experience and you could win a copy of ""Cheating Death"" Geraghty says she became depressed once she left the hospital because her perspective on her entire life changed. She still gets depressed, she says, and is on medication. ""I actually went to my doctor and said to her, 'I think I'm losing my mind. This can't be really happening,' you know, and she said it's OK, it's very hard to understand when you've been through an experience like that."" Geraghty has joined the cardiac arrest group, hoping that connecting with others who understand what she's been through will allow her to come to terms with what happened to her that cool spring day six months ago. And allow her to heal and move on.","Woman whose heart stopped describes ""floating,"" seeing dead loved ones .

"St Paul, Minnesota (CNN) -- It's been described as the solution to a problem nobody realized existed. But that hasn't stopped the humble Post-it Note from becoming a ubiquitous fixture of stationery cupboards worldwide, with manufacturers 3M producing 50 billion each year. The sticky yellow squares did not always look destined to set the office supply world alight. In fact, it took 12 years from when the technology behind the product was first developed, to Post-its hitting the market. The story of the Post-it -- the self-attaching note that adheres in such a way that it can be removed without causing damage -- begins in 1968. Spencer Silver, a chemist for the giant multinational Minnesotan company 3M, was attempting to develop a better adhesive. ""It was part of my job as a researcher to develop new adhesives, and at that time we wanted to develop bigger, stronger, tougher adhesives,"" he said. ""This was none of those."" What he came up with were microspheres, which retained their stickiness and had a ""removability characteristic,"" allowing attached surfaces to be peeled apart easily. For years he struggled to find a use for his invention, preaching the merits of his creation to unreceptive colleagues. ""I got to be known as 'Mr Persistent,' because I wouldn't give up,"" he said. Read more: The coder club turning out tween tech prodigies . But it never found a practical application, until in 1974 he was approached by a 3M colleague, Art Fry, who had heard him talk about his microspheres at a company seminar. Fry had been in church for choir practice, grappling with a regularly occurring problem with his hymnbook, when he had his ""eureka moment"" -- ""the one where you get the adrenaline rush,"" he says -- regarding the way Silver's microspheres could potentially help. During his Wednesday night choir practice, Fry would bookmark his hymnbook with pieces of paper -- but by Sunday morning they would have fallen out. ""I thought what I need is a bookmark that would stick to the paper without falling off and but not damage the sheets,"" he said. When the team started writing messages on the notes to communicate around the office, they realized the full potential of the idea. ""I thought what we have here isn't just a bookmark,"" said Fry. ""It's a whole new way to communicate."" Not everyone saw the value in the idea, says Fry, but the team continued to lobby for their idea and eventually in 1980, after extensive market testing, 3M released the product on to the market. From that point, the Post-it was unstoppable. Read more: Materials that magically mend . ""The Post-it notes took off so rapidly that I think it left a lot of people in marketing and sales gasping a little bit,"" said Silver. It spread ""like a virus,"" said Fry. ""It was always a self--advertising product,"" he said, because customers would put the notes on documents they sent to others, arousing the recipient's curiosity. ""They would look at it, peel it off and play with it and then go out and buy a pad for themselves.""

""Who would have thought that would have been useful for anything but you can't buy one these days without a camera or music on it.""

"(CNN) -- It's a familiar refrain among jet-lagged travelers, usually accompanied by a despondent shrug. ""Well, I guess we could just grab a quick bite at the hotel."" Hotel restaurants have long had a reputation for offering over-priced, unremarkable meals, frequented only by guests too tired or unadventurous to brave the streets of a new city in search of anything better. But over the last few years, a wave of incredible new restaurants has come onto the scene to change the way we view hotel dining. For proof, look no further than American food and drink website The Daily Meal's third annual list of the 101 Best Hotel Restaurants Around the World. ""In recent years, hotel restaurants have stepped up their game so much so that they have become coveted dining spots for locals and travelers alike, who are often either waiting in line or booking reservations months in advance just to be able to pull up a chair at the hottest restaurant in town — which happens to be in a hotel,"" says the site. To curate the list, The Daily Meal staff considered winners and nominees from the 2013 list of best hotel restaurants, consulted the Michelin Guide and other sources for further recommendations and drew hotel restaurants from its annual lists of the 101 Best Restaurants in Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. Then they grouped the selections by continent and invited a panel of experienced bloggers, restaurant critics and other food and lifestyle writers from around the world to vote for their favorites in an online survey. According to the rules, the hotel has to have at least 15 rooms and restaurants must be under the same roof as the hotel as well as the same proprietorship.

"(CNN) -- General Motor's own investigation may be over, but Congress has just begun. CNN has learned from Republican and Democratic sources that the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to hold hearings this month on how the automaker allowed fatally flawed ignition switches to remain inside vehicles for years. The Senate won't be far behind. Sen. Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri whose subcommittee is handling the issue, announced Thursday that she, too, would hold a hearing this summer. The push for hearings is one of many signs that even as GM put its internal investigation to rest Thursday, lawmakers have not made up their minds about how the company handled the problem, whether there could be criminal wrongdoing, and what are the company's responsibilities to victims from its mistake. ""The conclusion of GM's internal investigation marks an important milestone,"" wrote House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton in a statement released by his office. Family 'angry' despite GM firings . ""But our investigation continues as many questions remain for both the company and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,"" the Michigan Republican said. Upton praised an investigative report commissioned by GM and produced by former U.S. Attorney Anton Valuka as ""thorough,"" but said that it raised concerns about how the company handled the switch problem. GM admitted in February that its engineers first knew of the ignition switch problem as early as 2004. But it did not recall some 2.6 million affected vehicles until earlier this year. ""The initial findings are deeply disturbing, suggesting that communications and management failures ran deep and wide within GM,"" he wrote. GM estimates that 13 people died as a result of the switch flaw, which made affected cars prone to shutting off while on the road, disabling the airbags, power steering and anti-lock brakes. The delayed recall was caused by the misconduct of about 20 employees and ""a pattern of incompetence and neglect"" throughout the company, the report said. GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra announced that 15 employees had been dismissed and five more were been disciplined following the three-month probe. On the Senate side, McCaskill sent out a statement saying she is withholding judgment until she can read the report more closely. ""I'm looking forward to getting a full briefing from Mr. Valukas,"" she wrote, adding a note of scrutiny. ""I won't be letting GM leadership, or federal regulators, escape accountability for these tragedies."" The 300-page GM report is at the top of the heap of a much larger pile of paperwork that congressional investigators are sifting through on the issue. The Energy and Commerce Committee says it has received 1 million pages of documents from GM about the ignition switch problem, with some 400,000 pages arriving just in the last week. ""GM's internal assessment confirms many of the troubling details our ongoing House investigation is uncovering,"" wrote Rep. Diane DeGette of Colorado, who is the top Democrat on the House subcommittee tasked with the GM investigation. In a statement, she pointed to some initial conclusions, writing, ""siloed responsibilities and a corporate culture that deemphasized safety created an environment that allowed problems to linger, leading to additional accidents and loss of life."" DeGette is particularly watching an issue that GM has not resolved yet: compensation for victims. ""We also need more details to understand how accident victims may receive compensation from GM as well as what legal rights individuals may have to waive as a condition of payment,"" she wrote. Barra said the company would create a program to compensate those injured or killed by the defective cars, but she didn't say how large that fund would be. As House and Senate committees prepare for a busy next month, two members of Congress are pushing for something more: a new law. ""We need to enact legislation that requires auto manufacturers to submit information on possible defects as soon as they become aware of them,"" wrote Sen. Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. He and Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal have proposed the ""Early Warning System Improvement Act of 2014,"" which would require carmakers to automatically submit to NHTSA any accident report involving a fatality, and then it would require the agency make those documents public. Both sit on the Senate Commerce Committee, but so far no other senators have signed onto the bill and its future is not clear . GM will pay a $35 million fine to safety regulators over the switch debacle and is the subject of a federal criminal probe. GM also faces wrongful death lawsuits from victims' families. CNN's Chris Isidore and Poppy Harlow contributed to this report.","Automaker concludes internal investigation of fatal ignition switch problem .

"(CNN) -- Nearly 2,000 homeowners in New Jersey who had their lives turned upside down by Superstorm Sandy were wrongfully denied recovery funds, according to a new report released Thursday. Four of every five homeowners who appealed denials from the Reconstruction, Rehabilitation, Elevation, and Mitigation (RREM) program and the Resettlement programs in New Jersey had their rejections overturned, according to the Fair Share Housing Center, an organization that advocates for the rights of poor homeowners. The fate of thousands of other homeowners affected by Sandy remains unclear, according to the report. The RREM program provides up to $150,000 to cover the cost of rebuilding and elevating a home. Public records obtained by the Fair Share Housing Center show that 3,196 applicants were told by the Christie administration that they were ineligible for the program. Of the 1,033 who appealed the denial, 788, or 79 percent, were told they were in fact eligible for recovery funds. A similar percentage of residents who were denied up to $10,000 to cover non-rebuilding costs also had their rejections overturned in the appeal process, for a total of 1,090 households. Thousands more who were denied funds from either program did not appeal, according to the report. ""We were pretty shocked,"" said Adam Gordon, staff attorney at the advocacy group. ""Thousands of people were wrongfully rejected, and it was impacting people all over the state. We were just shocked by the sheer magnitude of it."" The report shows that a majority of the applicants who were denied funds were minority homeowners. ""I think it's a breach of faith in the basic fairness of government and appalling behavior, especially when it is directed toward people recovering from a disaster,"" Gordon said. A statement from the state's Department of Community Affairs, which administers Sandy recovery programs, said: ""The Fair Share Housing analysis leaves out both significant facts and context. DCA has ensured that anyone initially rejected received a thorough review of their application, resulting in reinstatement of eligibility and the award of recovery funds in every single eligible case."" The agency is placing part of the blame on the federal government. ""Noting the high number of ineligibility determinations, we investigated and learned FEMA provided the State with inaccurate damage assessment data. As a result, we obtained (Department of Housing and Urban Development) approval to allow applicants to demonstrate damage through third party sources,"" the statement said. A statement from Gov. Chris Christie's office released on Monday said that more than 5,100 Sandy-affected homeowners have been preliminarily awarded RREM grants and that approximately 3,000 would be moved off the waitlist. Christie met on Tuesday with a few homeowners impacted by the storm in Keansburg. He acknowledged their frustration with the slow recovery process. But he said things are improving and pointed out that nearly $1.2 billion in Sandy recovery funds have either already been distributed or are in the pipeline in New Jersey. ""Half the money is going toward housing. When you had 365,000 homes damaged or destroyed in the storm, this is the longest and most difficult part of trying to deal with the problem,"" Christie said. Christie blamed any delays in distributing funds on the process used to decide who gets what. There are two deciding factors: the amount of damage and the level of need based on a family's economic situation. ""That means you have to get more information to us. That means we have to review more information. That means the federal government will then review more information,"" he said. ""And it almost invariably means one of us will ask you for more things."" The Fair Share Housing Center is standing by its findings. ""The Christie administration's widespread rejection of large numbers of families actually eligible for Sandy aid shows that the Sandy recovery process has been flawed from start to finish,"" Gordon said. Concerned by the findings, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, is calling for more oversight. ""My office is aware of complaints from constituents concerned with discrepancies, long waiting lists and delays in receiving the help they need to rebuild their homes and lives,"" he said in a written statement. ""That is why I am calling for Senate hearings to explore ways to expedite relief to so many struggling New Jersey families still recovering more than a year after Superstorm Sandy."" U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-New Jersey, is also calling for greater oversight of Sandy recovery funds. He raised concerns about the firm hired in May to help process applications for funding. Hammerman & Gainer Inc. was fired by the state last month. ""We need a full accounting of the HGI contract, and I urge HUD to require the appointment of an independent monitor before the next round of funding goes out to ensure there isn't further mismanagement,"" Pascrell said in a written statement. The report comes at a critical point in the recovery effort in New Jersey. The state is preparing to distribute $1.46 billion in a second round of Sandy funding. At the same time, the U.S. Attorney's office is investigating claims from Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer that members of the Christie administration linked Sandy recovery funds to her approval of a real estate development project in her city.","Thousands were wrongly denied Sandy recovery funds, housing group says .
About 80% of appealed rejections were later deemed eligible, report says .

"(CNN) -- Marc Marquez tied the 1997 record of Australian legend Mick Doohan for most wins in a MotoGP season with victory Sunday in a thrilling Malaysian Grand Prix. It was the 12th win of the season for Repsol Honda's Marquez, who has already wrapped up his second straight world title. He had a race long battle with the Movistar Yamaha pair of Valentino Rossi and Jorge Lorenzo, who completed the podium in Sepang. The 21-year-old Marquez slipped to as low as ninth after a poor start from pole, but the Spaniard quickly worked his way back through the field, taking the lead for good on the 11th lap. Rossi, who won last week in Australia after Marquez crashed out, tracked him for the remainder of the race but finished 2.445 seconds adrift at the checkered flag. Italian legend Rossi has a 12-point advantage over his teammate Lorenzo in the battle for second place in the championship, heading into the final round in Valencia. Marquez will get the chance to beat Doohan's record on home soil and it is a prospect which thrills him. ""I've equaled Mick Doohan's record, with one race left maybe I can beat it,"" he told the official MotoGP website. ""If I had a bad result here the pressure in Valencia would be more. But now I am free in Valencia and I can do well for my fans and just enjoy it,"" he added. Marquez's teammate, Dani Pedrosa, saw his hopes ended by going off twice and he could not complete the race. The leading three were followed home, at some distance, by Germany's Stefan Bradl on a Honda and young British rider Bradley Smith on a Yamaha Tech 3. Smith's teammate, Pol Espargaro of Spain, came in sixth despite breaking a bone in his left foot in a fall during practice Saturday. Meanwhile, in the world rallying championship, Sebastien Ogier of France retained his global title with victory in the Rally of Spain Sunday. Ogier took the honors ahead of Volkswagen teammate Jari-Mari Latvala of Finland, the only man who could have denied him the title. Another Finn, Mikko Hirvonen, in a Ford Fiesta RS, was third. It was the seventh win in 12 rounds for the 30-year-old Ogier, who is only the fifth driver to achieve back-to-back title triumphs.","Marc Marquez wins Malaysian MotoGP in Sepang .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Friday will enable a religious-affiliated non-profit and other groups like it to remain temporarily exempt from Obamacare requirements for covering birth control and other reproductive health they oppose on moral grounds. The justices extended an injunction first granted on an emergency basis just before the New Year for a Catholic charity for the elderly run by nuns, the Little Sisters of the Poor. The high court order, which also covers the charity's insurance administrator, will remain in effect while lower courts continue to wrangle with the merits of the primary challenge to the federal health law mandates on contraception. Although temporary, it is an important victory for those objecting to the socially charged requirements under the Affordable Care Act that were a negotiated compromise aimed at allowing coverage but also allowing a workaround for those opposing it. In a once-sentence order without any noted dissent, the Supreme Court said the Obama administration could not enforce the mandates if those involved tell the Health and Human Services Department in writing that they are a non-profit and hold themselves ""out as religious and have religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services."" Although the high court order applies specifically to the Little Sisters of the Poor and its administrator, Christian Brothers Services, it will likely have the practical effect of keeping the government from forcing other religious non-profits that raised similar objections to comply with the mandates. For instance, Christian Brothers, an Ohio-based non-profit, handles insurance policies for a number of religious-affiliated organizations. A sticking point . The contraception issue has been a major sticking point in the health law, President Barack Obama's signature diplomatic achievement that overall has been the subject of enormous legal and political controversy. The requirements in question that took effect January 1 were designed by the administration to give women employed at nonprofit, religious-based organizations -- such as certain hospitals and private faith-based universities -- the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies with no co-pay. The central dispute revolves around a negotiated requirement for those religious-affiliated groups not wanting to comply to sign a form explaining their objections. So-called self-certification would permit third-party administrators to provide the coverage. Churches and houses of worships are exempt from the requirement outright. Religious-based groups sought delays, saying that signing the form would force them ""to choose between onerous penalties or becoming complicit in a grave moral wrong."" But the justices in their unsigned order concluded that to ""meet the condition for injunction pending appeal, applicants need not use the form prescribed by the government and need not send copies to third-party administrators."" Varied reaction . A Justice Department spokesman said in a statement that the ruling was narrowly applied to the plaintiffs and ""is not a ruling on the merits"" of the charity's larger legal appeal. The statement also said the Little Sisters of the Poor and Christian Brothers have ""always been eligible for an accommodation from the contraceptive coverage requirement."" The White House had said previously the birth control requirement was lawful and ""essential to a woman's health"" and that its rules struck the right balance. Others talked past each other in reacting to the decision. ""We are delighted that the Supreme Court has issued this order protecting the Little Sisters,"" said Mark Rienzi, senior counsel for the Becket Fund, the group representing the nuns in court. ""The government has lots of ways to deliver contraceptives to people. It doesn't need to force nuns to participate."" But Cecile Richards, president, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, agreed with the Justice Department in that the decision was ""narrow and specific"" and centered around an administrative mechanism for claiming exemption. ""This is a case about paperwork, not religious liberty,"" Richards said in a statement. Back to the appeals court . The issue now goes back to the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver, which will hold oral arguments in coming weeks. A ruling by mid-year could then prompt a final, eventual high court review. Recognizing that, the Supreme Court made clear it has not decided the larger legal and constitutional issues at stake, merely acted on the enforcement question. ""The court issues this order based on all of the circumstances of the case, and this order should not be construed as an expression of the court's views on the merits,"" the justices said. In March, they will take up a related challenge to the birth control mandate when the court hears arguments over whether some for-profit corporations should be exempt, again on religious liberty grounds. Key requirements of the Affordable Care Act are just now kicking into gear following years of fierce political and other turmoil that included a Supreme Court ruling that found it constitutional, and a flawed rollout of its online enrollment process this past fall. The case is Little Sisters of the Poor v. Sebelius (13a691). CNN's Jim Acosta and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","Charity run by nuns sought exemption from health law contraception mandates .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon general counsel threatened legal action Thursday against a former Navy SEAL who wrote a revealing book about last year's Osama bin Laden raid, warning him he has violated secrecy agreements and broken federal law. In a letter addressed to ""Mark Owen,"" the pen name of book author Matt Bissonnette, General Counsel Jeh Charles Johnson wrote the Pentagon is considering pursuing ""all remedies legally available"" against the former SEAL and his publisher, Penguin Putnam. ""In the judgment of the Department of Defense, you are in material breach and violation of the nondisclosure agreements you signed. Further public dissemination of your book will aggravate your breach and violation of your agreements,"" Johnson wrote. The book is called ""No Easy Day"" and is a gripping account of the Navy SEAL raid on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan last year that ended in the death of the world's most notorious terrorist leader. The story sheds more light on the now famous skill and daring of the SEALs. But the book's very existence stoked controversy because members of the elite unit don't usually divulge details of their operations. The book is one of several accounts about the operation to have surfaced after last year's raid. Buzz ramps up over SEAL's bin Laden book . Government officials only recently became aware the former SEAL was writing a book, but they were told it encompassed more than just the raid and included vignettes from training and other missions. They wanted to see a copy, a Defense Department official said, to make sure no classified information would be released and to see if the book contained any information that might identify other team members. Thursday's letter to Bissonnette came after a department review of the book. Bissonnette wrote in the book that he was part of a team heading up a stairwell in search of bin Laden, forces led by a SEAL point man. ""We were less than five steps from getting to the top when I heard suppressed shots. ""BOP BOP. ""The point man had seen a man peeking out of the door on the right side of the hallway about ten feet in front of him. I couldn't tell from my position if the rounds hit the target or not."" They went into a room and saw two women standing over a man at the foot of a bed, ""hysterically crying and wailing in Arabic."" One of the women shouted in Arabic and moved toward the point man. ""Swinging his gun to the side,"" the point man grabbed the women and moved them to a corner. ""If either woman had on a suicide vest, he probably saved our lives, but it would have cost him his own. It was a selfless decision made in a split second,"" Bissonnette wrote. Bissonnette described how he and another SEAL entered the room and saw the man, clad in a white sleeveless T-shirt, loose tan pants and a tan tunic, twitching and convulsing. The author said he and another SEAL finished him off with several rounds and soon after identified him as the notorious leader of al Qaeda. The killing occurred even though a government lawyer told the SEALs that if bin Laden didn't pose a threat, he should be detained. The author found two empty firearms during a search of the area, saying bin Laden apparently ""hadn't even prepared a defense"" and had ""no intention of fighting."" According to an earlier and contradictory account from a U.S. official, bin Laden was shot after the SEALs went into the room. That account said the al Qaeda leader was moving, possibly toward one of the weapons that were in the room when he was shot. He never had a gun in hand but posed an imminent threat, according to the U.S. official. Bissonnette said he had mixed feelings about President Barack Obama, who ordered the operation. ""None of us were huge fans of Obama. We respected him as the commander-in-chief of the military and for giving us the green light on the mission,"" wrote the former SEAL, who was a 36-year-old chief petty officer when he left the Navy as a highly decorated commando in April. CNN obtained a copy of the book, which will officially be released September 4. It first had a release date of September 11, but Dutton, a Penguin imprint, said the book will come out early because of ""overwhelming excitement in the marketplace."" The first printing of the book, already an Amazon best seller, is now 575,000 copies, according to Dutton. Opinion: Sense and nonsense about Obama and Osama .

"Concord, New Hampshire (CNN) -- Republican Scott Brown used the latest potential Ebola case -- this time, a doctor in New York -- to blast President Barack Obama's handling of the virus outbreak in a debate against New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen Thursday night. It was a local debate that turned on national issues as Brown called for a ban on travel from the West African epicenter of the outbreak and defended his suggestion that Ebola could come across the border with Mexico. He blasted Obama's appointment of Ron Klain as the nation's Ebola response coordinator as someone ""with no experience in his field."" He criticized Shaheen for not voting to close the U.S. border with Mexico. And he complained that the New York doctor should have been quarantined when he returned to the United States. Brown even said the Ebola threat would be minimized if Republican Mitt Romney had been elected president. ""Had he been president, I feel he would have had a clear and concise plan. He would have reassured the American people,"" Brown said. Shaheen, meanwhile, criticized Brown for ""fear-mongering about this issue,"" and said neither she nor Brown have medical expertise on the issue. But Brown shot back that ""she calls it fear-mongering; I call it rational fear."" The exchange -- in a debate being moderated by CNN's Wolf Blitzer and held at the NH1 studios in New Hampshire's capital city of Concord -- was the latest demonstration of Brown's effort to nationalize the race -- connecting Shaheen to Obama and national Democrats and accusing them of wobbly responses to threats that have emerged this summer and fall. Brown has focused his campaign on national issues, also blasting President Barack Obama for his handling of ISIS, illegal immigration and a host of other issues -- then latching Shaheen to Obama by pointing to her votes for his initiatives. Shaheen, meanwhile, has questioned the former Massachusetts senator's move into New Hampshire, casting him as a political opportunist and accusing him of being vague on his support for abortion rights, equal pay for women and more. The two have both dodged answers about whether they would support their parties' leaders -- Democrat Harry Reid and Republican Mitch McConnell -- for majority leader. Entering Thursday night's debate, the race was a dead heat. A new CNN/ORC International poll found Shaheen with 49 percent support to Brown's 47 percent -- well inside its margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. Brown's favorability rating was underwater, with 50 percent of the likely voters surveyed . saying they have unfavorable views of him versus 48 percent saying their views are favorable. Shaheen, meanwhile, scored a 52 percent favorability rating. However, the race could turn on whether Shaheen is able to keep on her side voters who . have turned on Obama. His approval rating dropped to 39 percent in New Hampshire -- which has driven Brown's efforts to connect Shaheen with the president. Related: Poll shows dead heat in New Hampshire . It was what dozens of supporters of both candidates were talking about while cheering and chanting for their favored candidates outside the NH1 studio before the debate started. Alice Chamberlin, a 64-year-old environmental lawyer from Warner who stopped by to pick up a pro-Shaheen sign before the debate, said some voters are turned off by Brown's approach. ""I think you can talk about the national issues all you want. People get that Scott Brown is just using us for a national stage,"" she said. She pointed to Shaheen's support for equal pay and access to health care as issues that will help drive Democratic-leaning voters to the polls, and praised Shaheen's deep political ties to New Hampshire, including her three two-year terms as governor. ""We who have lived here for a long time -- and I've lived here since 1976 -- know what she's done,"" she said in a veiled shot at Brown, the former Massachusetts senator. Brown supporters said he has more than enough connections to the state. ""I think anybody that was born in this state has every state to run for Senate in the state that they were born in,"" said Paul Schibbelhute, a 59-year-old mechanical engineer from Nashua who said he had crossed into Massachusetts in 2010 to volunteer for Brown's campaign there. He said the ""biggest issue"" in the race is that Shaheen has backed Obama's policies in the vast majority of her Senate votes, calling her ""carte blanche for the president.""","Ebola was the first issue as candidates squared off at a CNN / NH1 debate in New Hampshire .

"(CNN) -- It is another landmark in the career of one of football's greatest ever players. Another two goals in the colors of Barcelona took Lionel Messi to 71 in the European Champions League -- level with the all-time record holder Raul. The Argentina striker grabbed both goals as the Spanish giants beat Ajax 2-0 in Amsterdam, and now needs just one more to go clear of the legendary Spain striker. Messi is already Barca's all-time leading scorer and a four-time Ballon d'Or winner at the age of 27. Not only did he move level with Raul in the Champions League scoring charts, he also edged one ahead of another stand out player of this generation -- Cristiano Ronaldo. The Real Madrid striker failed to add to his tally in his side's 1-0 victory over Liverpool on Tuesday night, but the battle to beat Raul's record is still very much on. Messi's first came from that rare source -- his head. His fine finish from Marc Bartra's cross was only the fourth header in that bumper haul of 71 goals. And with 15 minutes left, Messi slid in to polish off a Pedro cross from the left to pull himself level with Raul. His brace also secured Barca's spot in the last 16 of the competition. Man City implosion . Elsewhere, it was another miserable European night for English Premier League champions Manchester City. Despite its riches and its legion of international stars, Manuel Pellegrini's men sank to rock bottom in its group after a 2-1 home defeat to CSKA Moscow, who had never before won in England. Only once has City made it out of the group stages -- last season -- when it was beaten 4-1 by Spanish giants Barcelona in its last 16 clash. Despite City's victory over neighbors United in the Manchester derby on Sunday, it has been in poor form of late, failing to win any of its three matches before that. And in a subdued atmosphere, it fell behind inside 96 seconds to a striker fast becoming its nemesis -- Seydou Doumbia. The Ivorian rose highest to meet an early free kick and plant it beyond England goalkeeper Joe Hart to score his fourth goal against City. Doumbia's fellow countryman Yaya Toure brought the home side level with a stunning free kick of his own, firing into the top corner from 25 yards out. But City self destructed again, a poor clearance from Gael Clichy allowing Bebras Natcho to pick Doumbia, who fired into the net past Hart. City's task became more difficult when Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho was sent off with 20 minutes remaining and things went from bad to worse ten minutes later when Toure was also dismissed. CSKA saw out the remaining minutes to leapfrog City in the table and keep its own qualification hopes alive. ""It's very difficult to understand why we played so badly,"" Pellegrini told Sky Sports. ""We were nervous. We didn't play. It's difficult to know why you have such a low performance from important players. It's a strange moment. ""I don't think it's just this competition -- in the last two weeks we are not playing the way we normally do. I don't understand but we must find a reason. It's a crisis of confidence."" In the group's other clash, Bayern Munich followed up its 7-1 win over AS Roma in Italy with a 2-0 success at home, Franck Ribéry and Mario Götze grabbing the goals. Another English club -- Premier League leaders Chelsea -- struggled against NK Maribor, drawing 1-1 with the Slovenian minnows. After squandering a string of first-half chances, Jose Mourinho's side were made to pay when Agim Ibraimi curled a fine effort into the top corner beyond Petr Cech on 50 minutes. Luka Zahovic missed a glorious chance to double Maribor's lead, firing over the bar from barely six yards out with the goal gaping, before Nemanja Matic equalized with 17 minutes to go. Belgium international Eden Hazard had a late penalty saved by Jasmin Handanovic, but Chelsea extended its lead at the top of the group after German club Schalke were beaten 4-2 by Sporting Lisbon in Portugal. ""I was not happy with the team or the performance,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports. ""I think we deserved to win but with this referee I have a long story from my Italian times but I don't want to go in this direction. ""They gave absolutely everything -- they fought fantastically well for their point. It is a big day for them so it is also fair to praise them."" Elsewhere, Paris Saint-Germain beat Apoel Nicosia 1-0 thanks to Edinson Cavani's goal after 54 seconds -- the quickest in this year's competition so far. Spanish side Athletic Bilbao slumped to a 2-0 defeat by Portuguese outfit Porto, while Ukrainian club Shakthar Donestsk beat BATE Borisov 5-0, two weeks after winning 7-0 in Belarus.","Lionel Messi pulls level with Raul's record haul of 71 Champions League goals .

"Manila, the Philippines (CNN) -- After four countries, three formal state dinners, two speeches to American troops and one encounter with a menacing humanoid robot, President Barack Obama flies home Tuesday having completed his long-awaited trip to Asia. The goals for the visit were ambitious: reassure allies the United States remains committed to a ""pivot to Asia,"" secure new deals to expand trade, and send a message to China that the United States has its allies' backs in territorial disputes. Some of those goals were met; others less so. Here are five takeaways from Obama's trip to Asia: . 1. China, China, China . Obama came to Asia to bolster ties with Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. But his stops in all four countries all seemed designed, in part, to send a message to China: ""We're on their side."" While Obama and his aides have been quick to dispel the notion this week's trip amounted to a ""containment tour,"" the President's announcements throughout his visit — mostly military in nature — made clear the White House knew Beijing was watching closely. Before Obama even landed in Tokyo he'd taken Japan's side in its bitter spat with China over a set of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea — suggesting the United States would lend support to Japan should the squabble escalate militarily. Obama begins Asia tour with reassurance to Japan . A week later, the White House announced the United States and the Philippines would enter into a new defense pact that allows for more American troops in Southeast Asia — interpreted by China as an attempt to balance its own presence in a region where land and water are in constant dispute. Obama denied that was the intention of the agreement. ""Our goal is not to counter China, our goal is not to contain China,"" he said in Manila. But more troops in the region will undoubtedly be some deterrent against any Chinese incursion into contested waters. For the first time since the 1990s, when American bases were closed in the Philippines, the United States will have a substantial military footprint there. And that's no accident, say experts who predict the next major world crisis will unfold off of China's coast. ""This is a region that's going to be on the boil for years and years to come,"" said Robert Kaplan, the chief geopolitical analyst for Stradfor, on CNN this week. ""Seas crowded with warships, submarines, merchant shipping, fifth generation fighter jets — that can easily create incidents that in turn could enable a crisis."" That's exactly the kind of crisis Obama wants to prevent through greater U.S. attention to China's neighbors. In Seoul the President said China ""has to abide by certain norms"" when it comes to its quarrels with neighbors. 2. Trade a tougher sell . Obama's promise of greater U.S. military cooperation in Asia was largely welcomed in the countries he visited. Less so was his pitch for new trade agreements, which sputtered in Japan in the midst of domestic political challenges for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. CNNMoney: Obama fails to secure breakthrough in Japan trade talks . The Trans Pacific Partnership would ease business ties between the United States and Asian partners — a goal Obama claims would create jobs for both sides while opening up new markets for U.S. firms. After several rounds of negotiations, Obama had hoped to be able to announce an agreement with Japan during his stop in Tokyo. That proved impossible as talks stalled amid Japanese concerns over agricultural protections for beef and rice. The two sides scrambled to produce evidence of progress, working right up until Obama was about to depart Japan to provide a positive update on the talks. Even then, the White House was only able to say the two sides had ""identified a path forward"" in the negotiations — without specifying where the two sides were coming into agreement. ""There are still negotiations to be had. There are details to be worked out,"" said a senior administration official, adding the two sides had agreed only on ""parameters"" for the deal. It was a disappointing result for the first stop of Obama's Asia trip, though his own domestic politics — including resistance to new trade deals from Democrats in Congress — would have made any new deal a tough sell. That political opposition makes it all but impossible for Obama to see a new trade deal through Congress before the 2014 midterm elections. 3. Did Obama get his pivot? It would be hard to argue Obama wasn't making good on his vow to refocus his foreign policy toward Asia this week — after a canceled trip and crises in other parts of the world, at least he made it to the continent. But the question remains whether the focus can be sustained. Even as he toured Asian capitals and touted cooperation between nations, another international crises — in this case, Ukraine — ended up producing the biggest headlines this week when Obama announced more sanctions on Russia on Monday. Putin's inner circle hit by new U.S. sanctions . In the coming months, the administration hopes to hammer out a final agreement on Iran's nuclear program, rid Syria of its chemical weapons, and revive Mideast peace talks — all issues that have overshadowed the Asia pivot in the past. Is the U.S. losing its ability to sway allies? Netanyahu: No peace talks if Abbas is backed by Hamas . The administration has bristled at the notion it can only focus on one issue at a time — as Evan Medeiros, Obama's senior director for Asian Affairs, said before this week's trip, ""We can walk and chew gum at the same time."" But as Obama has discovered, distractions at home and abroad can gum up even the best laid foreign policy platform. Political chatter: Sanctions, Netanyahu's red line . His lack of action in Syria, for example, ended up causing heartburn for Asian allies worried the United States wouldn't back them if China crossed a so-called ""red line."" The unfolding situation in Ukraine — which Obama has explicitly said won't involve a U.S. military solution — has Asian allies similarly wary. During his final stop in Asia, Obama fiercely defended his foreign policy choices, arguing that his decisions to avoid military force shouldn't be viewed by Americans — or allies — as weak. ""Why is it that everybody is so eager to use military force after we've just gone through a decade of war at enormous costs to our troops and to our budget?"" he asked in the Philippines. ""And what is it exactly that these critics think would have been accomplished?"" ""We hit singles, we hit doubles, every once in a while we may be able to hit a home run,"" he added later. ""But we steadily advance the interests of the American people and our partnerships with folks around the world."" 4. 'Consoler-in-chief' travels . Obama's short stays in South Korea and Malaysia came at dark times for both nations, still reeling from major transportation disasters that have many questioning each government's response. As he often does at home, Obama acted as ""consoler-in-chief,"" offering support to victims' families during pauses from policy and diplomatic demands. But he avoided taking a stance on how each nation was responding to its crisis — even as shakeups in leadership ranks were brewing. In South Korea, Obama presented the country's president with a framed American flag that was flown over the White House the same day of the tragic ferry accident that left — at latest count — nearly 200 dead. The accident has prompted widespread grief in the country, as well as anger at the government's response. At his next stop, in Malaysia, Obama confronted yet another disaster, this time the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Like in Seoul, Obama expressed his condolences to victims' family members — but avoided wading into the controversy surrounding the government's response. Officials have come under withering criticism from China, where a majority of the passengers hailed, accused of botching the search and keeping family members in the dark. 5. People to people . In Asia, Obama's chief success on paper was the military agreement with the Philippines — a pact carefully hammered out by legions of government negotiators over months. But Obama's calibrated attempts to reach out to people at a personal level also play into his long-term goal of more closely aligning the United States and Asia. As he does in nearly every foreign country he visits, Obama stopped at schools and youth centers to meet people going about their lives — and offer them at least a small glimpse at the man whose job is leader of the free world. Nowhere was that more evident than Malaysia, a country the United States hopes will become a firm ally in Southeast Asia. His stop there, the first by a U.S. president in decades, comes after an economic growth spurt and renewed — though still cautious — desire for ties with the United States. With that in mind, Obama took questions for more than an hour from a diverse group of students at the University of Malaya, fielding queries on his younger self, his family, his successes, and his failings. When asked about his biggest regret, Obama didn't offer political misgivings or wishes for foreign policy do-overs. He told the crowd he wished he had spent more time with his mom before her death. ""I realized that I didn't -- every single day, or at least more often -- just spend time with her and find out what she was thinking and what she was doing, because she had been such an important part of my life,"" he said. It was a rare look into Obama's inner workings, offered not at home but abroad. And if Malaysians walked into the forum regarding Obama only as a foreign leader, they left with a sense of someone struggling with the same human conundrums as anyone else — perhaps making the gap between nations somehow smaller. ""Our strategy is more than just security alliances or trade agreements,"" Obama said at the forum. ""It's also about building genuine relationships between the peoples of Asia and the peoples of the United States."" 5 takeaways from Obama's Philippines news conference . 5 takeaways from Obama's Seoul news conference .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Pvt. Joseph Foster was filling out routine paperwork for his upcoming deployment to Afghanistan on Thursday when he heard a shout quickly followed by a burst of gunfire from just a few feet away. ""I was sitting in about the second row back when the assailant stood up and yelled 'Allahu akbar' in Arabic and he opened fire,"" Foster said Monday on CNN's ""American Morning."" Foster, 21, did not forget his basic training, which may have saved his life and the lives of others. ""[I] got down on the floor, moved to cover. One soldier had peeked his head around the cubicle I was hiding in ... and I pulled him in,"" Foster said. Foster realized he had been shot in the hip but was too consumed by adrenaline to think about his injury. ""Another soldier had come in as soon as the assailant had moved away from us,"" he said. ""Those two got up and got out, and I got out shortly behind him."" Once outside, Foster said, he hid behind a military shipping container ""and started doing what I was trained to do."" ""[I] started helping get people into the next building and get them under cover,"" he said. Despite his injury, Foster, who has a wife and two young children, said he still plans to deploy to Afghanistan in January. ""I'm still a soldier day in and day out,"" he said. ""I'll do my job."" Authorities are trying to figure out what prompted the gunman to begin shooting at Fort Hood Army Post, killing 13 people and wounding 42. Fifteen soldiers are still hospitalized, including eight patients in intensive care, Fort Hood commander Lt. Gen. Robert Cone said Monday. Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, a 39-year-old licensed Army psychiatrist who worked at a hospital on the post, is the suspected shooter. He was shot several times, ending the attack, and is now conscious and talking, a spokesman at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio said Monday. It is unclear if Army investigators have spoken to Hasan. The intense investigation into the mass shooting remains largely shrouded in silence. Army officials have voiced concern about jumping to any conclusions about the motive, warning about a possible backlash against Muslim soldiers. Several bystanders, like Foster, reported Hasan shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great,"" which terrorists have used as a battle cry. The Army leadership at Fort Hood will ""take a very hard look at ourselves and look at anything that might have been done to have prevented this,"" Cone said Monday. ""Hasan was a soldier, and we have other soldiers ... that might have some of the same stress and indicators that he has,"" Cone said. ""We have to look across our entire formation, not just in a medical community, but really look hard to our right and left. That's the responsibility for everybody, from the top to the bottom, to make sure we're taking care of our own."" Cone said Monday that he has instructed commanders at Fort Hood to ""immediately take a hard look and make sure if there's anybody out there struggling [that] we're going to address their issues."" Sen. Joe Lieberman said he plans a Senate committee hearing into whether the shootings were a terrorist act and whether the Army should responded to reported signs of Islamic extremism by the suspected gunman. If Hasan was showing signs of being an Islamic extremist, the Army should have acted on that earlier, and ""he should have been gone,"" said Lieberman, a Connecticut independent and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" The shooting, on the nation's largest military base, sparked outrage. In his Saturday radio address, President Obama said it was ""an act of violence that would have been heartbreaking had it occurred any place in America."" But, he said, ""it's all the more heartbreaking and all the more despicable because of the place where it occurred and the patriots who were its victims."" All but one of those who were killed were soldiers. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will attend a Tuesday memorial service for the victims. Defense Secretary Robert Gates will also participate in the memorial service, but he will not speak, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said. Gates on Monday night will go to Fort Hood, where he will meet with the victims' families as well as Fort Hood Police Sgt. Kimberly Munley, the civilian officer who confronted and disabled Hasan as they shot at each other. Gates will also meet with military officials at the Army base, including Fort Hood's commanding general, Lt. Gen. Robert Cone, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, according to Morrell. CNN's David Mattingly and Victor Hernandez contributed to this report.","Pvt. Joseph Foster was doing paperwork when he heard a shout, then gunfire .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. drone crashed Saturday in Pakistan's tribal region, U.S. and Pakistani officials said. The cause of the crash was unknown, but a U.S. official denied reports that the drone had been shot down. Two Pakistani intelligence officials told CNN that witnesses in North Waziristan reported the crash near the village of Machikhel. The Pakistanis had only these witness accounts to go by, and were working to verify the crash and its causes with its own sources, the officials said. North Waziristan is one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region and widely believed to be a sanctuary for the Haqqani network and other militant groups that fuel the insurgency across the border in Afghanistan. Two drone strikes killed 12 suspected insurgents in the region on February 16. The United States does not publicly acknowledge its drone program, although President Barack Obama commented on such strikes in January and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta acknowledged the use of CIA predator drones in the region last year. The CIA did not comment on Saturday's incident. CNN's Pam Benson and Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","A U.S. official confirms that a drone crashed in Pakistan .

"(CNN) -- As fellow family members challenge claims that the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States lied about his exposure to the virus, the man's mother rallied around him Friday in describing him as a good person who she just wants to hug again. ""Everyone (in the family) loves him because (if) anything happens to us, he's always there for us,"" Nowah Gartay, Thomas Eric Duncan's mother, told CNN. Duncan arrived in Texas from Liberia on Saturday, September 20. He started feeling sick a few days later, before being admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital -- where he'd gone and been sent home previously -- on Sunday, September 28. Two days later, a blood test confirmed he had Ebola. Duncan is currently in isolation in serious condition at the same Dallas hospital. How the Liberian national left Africa, and whether he should have been allowed to, has become a hot topic in recent days. Hazmat crews clean up, quarantined quartet moved out . Before flying out, Duncan allegedly answered ""no"" to questions on a health screening questionnaire about whether he'd cared for anyone with Ebola, touched the body of someone who died in an area affected by the disease. But Tugbeh Chief Tugbeh, a community leader in Liberia, has said that Duncan was ""a caretaker"" for a woman who died from Ebola at a residence outside the capital of Monrovia. Because of these and other claims, Liberia Airport Authority officials say they may prosecute Duncan if he lied before leaving that West African nation. The Dallas County District Attorney's office said Friday that it is ""looking into whether or not Thomas Eric Duncan knowingly and intentionally exposed the public to a deadly virus -- making this a criminal matter."" Discussing this case, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told Canadian public broadcaster CBC, ""The fact that he knew (he was exposed to the virus) and he left the country is unpardonable, quite frankly."" ""With the U.S. doing so much to help us fight Ebola, and again one of our compatriots didn't take due care, and so, he's gone there and ... put some Americans in a state of fear, and put them at some risk, and so I feel very saddened by that and very angry with him, to tell you the truth."" Duncan's nephew on Friday strongly rejected such allegations, much like other relatives have in recent days. Sitting alongside Gartay in Charlotte, North Carolina, Josephus Weeks told CNN's Jim Sciutto that Duncan told him ""he had moved a long time ago"" from an area hit hard by Ebola. ""He said, 'Well, I wasn't even in that area,'"" said Weeks in direct response to Tugbeh's claim. ""... He wasn't a part of that whole scenario that has been populating the news all these many days. So that's inaccurate."" Weeks proceeded to take a shot at some Liberian citizens and ""so many ignorant government officials,"" saying it's not fair that such claims can be made public without being vetted first. ""Any time they see a camera, they just jump right in front of it and make a statement,"" Weeks said. ""Unfortunately, most of them are ignorant, and they are all lies."" As to what's happened in the United States, Weeks criticized Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital for not connecting the dots and passing on relevant information that Duncan had come from Liberia. This should have tipped off the possibility he had Ebola, given his symptoms; instead he was let go from the hospital after about four hours, according to his partner, who identified herself to CNN only as Louise. U.S. health officials have said that the failure to pass on this information was a mistake. ""It was upsetting to find that he was possibly infected with that deadly disease, and the hospital was not showing me any signs that they were equipped to handle that particular situation,"" said Weeks, who added that he called the U.S. Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention but did not specify when. Who's in charge of stopping Ebola in the U.S.? Youngor Jallah -- Louise's daughter who called Duncan her ""stepdaddy,"" though her mother and he aren't believed to be legally married -- was the one who called Sunday for the ambulance for Duncan while visiting the apartment where he was staying. But she told CNN on Friday night that she learned that Duncan had Ebola ""on the news."" Jallah said she's especially frustrated that, while she may not be technically quarantined, health officials told her Tuesday, ""we can't go outside, we can't do nothing."" ""We asked them, 'Can we go outside to get our babies' diapers'?"" she said. ""They told us, 'No. You guys should stay in here until we can ask our boss if you guys can go out."" Three days later, Jallah -- who claims Duncan never threw up or even went to the bathroom when she saw him -- hasn't heard back. ""No one gave me any direction,"" she said. ""... I'm scared."" All these frustrations notwithstanding, Duncan's mother also made a point Friday to emphatically thank the doctors, nurses and attendants now caring for her son. While some might have made mistakes, others are working hard to try to get him better. ""I thank every one of you, (I) thank you for my son,"" she said. ""I love him. All (his) family members love him.""","NEW: DA's office looking into whether Duncan ""intentionally exposed"" public to Ebola .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored an extra-time winner as Barcelona came from behind to beat Estudiantes 2-1 in the Club World Cup final on Saturday to confirm the Spanish and European champions as the top team on the planet. Argentina star Messi sunk his compatriots, the South American champions, as he chested in a cross from Daniel Alves with 10 minutes left in Abu Dhabi. Estudiantes took a shock lead against the run of play eight minutes before halftime when Mauro Boselli beat Barcelona fullback Eric Abidal to a left-wing cross from Juan Manuel Diaz to head home. Barcelona poured forward in search of an equalizer, with Europe's player of the year Messi denied by goalkeeper Damian Albil after a mazy run that saw him beat four opposition players. The Catalan giants finally leveled with just a minute of regulation time left, as defender Gerard Pique -- who had been thrust into a more attacking role -- set up substitute Pedro for a header into the net. The young winger followed up his goal in the 3-1 semifinal victory against Atlante, which made him the first player to score in six different competitions in a single calendar year. Barcelona dominated in extra-time and it was no surprise when Messi pounced with an opportunist effort in the 110th minute to give Barcelona their first title in the event, having lost 1-0 to Internacional in the final three years ago. Asian champions Pohang Steelers claimed third place after beating Mexico's Atlante 4-3 on penalties after the match finished 1-1 following extra-time. Kim Hyun-Gil scored the winning spot-kick after Song Dong-Jin saved Rafael Marquez's effort and Horacio Peralta hit the post. Marquez had scored a minute after halftime to cancel out Denilson's opener three minutes before the interval. Barcelona's Spanish league lead was reduced to two points as second-placed Real Madrid hammered struggling Zaragoza 6-0 on Saturday. Gonzalo Higuain and Rafael van der Vaart both scored twice in the first half, while Cristiano Ronaldo and substitute Karim Benzema netted after the break. Third-placed Sevilla failed to keep in touch with the leaders, losing 2-1 at home to Getafe, while Athletic Bilbao moved up to sixth with a 2-0 victory over Osasuna. In Germany, Bayer Leverkusen returned to the top of the Bundesliga with a 3-2 win at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach. Schalke are a point back in second after Friday's 1-0 win over Mainz, while Bayern Munich are two off the leading pace in third following a 5-2 crushing of bottom club Hertha Berlin. Borussia Dortmund climbed to fourth with a 1-0 victory at home to Freiburg. French champions Bordeaux went eight points clear with a 4-1 win at home to Lorient as nearest rivals Marseille, who have played one fewer match, drew 0-0 at St Etienne.","Barcelona come from behind to beat Estudiantes 2-1 in the Club World Cup final .

"Rome (CNN) -- Under furious assault from conservative Catholics, the Vatican backtracked Tuesday on its surprisingly positive assessment of gays and same-sex relationships. In a report Monday, the Vatican had said that gays and lesbians have ""gifts to offer"" the Christian community and acknowledged that same-sex couples can give ""precious support"" to one other. The statement, an interim report from a closely watched meeting of Catholic clergy here, was widely praised by liberals. It is believed to be the first time the Vatican has said anything positive about gay relationships. One longtime Vatican journalist called the statement a ""pastoral earthquake."" But many conservatives complained that the statement watered down church teaching and did not accurately reflect their discussions here, where nearly 200 Catholic leaders are meeting to debate pastoral approaches to modern family life. One South African cardinal called Monday's statement, which also included positive language about unmarried couples who cohabitate, ""irredeemable."" ""The message has gone out that this is what the synod is saying, this is what the Catholic Church is saying,"" said Cardinal Wilfrid Fox Napier, referring to the special meeting of Catholic clergy gathered here through Saturday. ""It's not what we're saying at all."" In response to such reactions, the Vatican backtracked a bit Tuesday. In a statement, it said the report on gays and lesbians was a ""working document,"" not the final word from Rome. The Vatican also said that it wanted to welcome gays and lesbians in the church, but not create ""the impression of a positive evaluation"" of same-sex relationships, or, for that matter, of unmarried couples who live together. But gay rights groups say that's precisely the impression the Vatican gave Monday when it said: . ""Homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer to the Christian community. Are we capable of welcoming these people, guaranteeing to them a fraternal space in our communities? Often they wish to encounter a church that offers them a welcoming home. Are our communities capable of providing that, accepting and valuing their sexual orientation, without compromising Catholic doctrine on the family and matrimony?"" Such statements seem to be in line with the more merciful approach the church has taken toward gays and lesbians under Pope Francis. In 2013, Francis famously said, ""Who am I to judge?"" gay people. On Monday morning, just before the Vatican released its positive report on gays, Francis preached that laws that do not lead people to Jesus are ""dead;"" what's more, Christ did ""strange things"" such as hanging out with sinners and tax collectors, the Pope preached, seemingly tipping his hand about the Vatican's direction. The overarching goal of the meeting here, officially called the Extraordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family, is to present proposals for a larger gathering to be held in October 2015. Which means there's a long road ahead before any doctrinal or pastoral changes happen in the church. In the meantime, conservative and liberal bishops have been fiercely jousting in the court of public opinion. Monday's report only increased the war of words. Cardinal Raymond Burke, an American and head of the Vatican's supreme court, said the report ""lacks a solid foundation in the sacred Scriptures."" Other conservatives called it a ""betrayal."" Opinion: 3 ways the Catholic church should embrace gay rights . Liberal Catholics and gay activists, on the other hand, heralded Monday's statement and said that some conservative pushback was probably inevitable, given how hostile some corners of the church are to change. ""I actually don't think this is as much of a backtrack as we usually see!"" said Marianne Duddy-Burke, head of the gay rights group Dignity USA. ""I think that response to this report was swift and intense, and I'm sure many bishops want to be sure people aren't reading more into it than is there,"" she continued. ""However, it is undeniable that there has never been any Vatican document that made positive, respectful statements about same-sex relationships, so that is an undeniable breakthrough."" Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, echoed that sentiment. ""Regardless of the fact that this is a working document, it is still significant in that it reveals a strong current of affirmative attitudes at high levels in the church towards lesbians and gay people,"" he said.","Liberal Catholics and gay activists heralded Vatican's initial statement .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's poll numbers are nothing to brag about, but there's little evidence he has suffered so far this year a ""Katrina moment"" that caused his predecessor's numbers to plummet. A new CNN/ORC International survey indicates that public opinion of the President has barely budged in the wake of new challenges that Obama has faced this year. According to the poll, which was released Wednesday, the President's approval rating among Americans stands at 42%. That's not great, but it's basically unchanged since March. Only 42% believe that Obama can manage the government effectively. Again, nothing to celebrate, but it's virtually unchanged from the 43% who felt that way in March. ""When Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005, the biggest impact on attitudes toward George W. Bush came in the number who said that he could manage the government effectively. That number dropped 10 points, and no other personal quality measured at that time changed as much,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Using that as a definition of a 'Katrina moment,' it looks like Obama has not experienced a similar drop in the summer of 2014, in part because his numbers already took that hit last year and have stabilized since then."" The survey indicates there have been one-to-two point changes (which are within the poll's sampling error) in the number of Americans who say that Obama is a strong leader, that he shares their values and that he cares about people. ""Once again, those numbers are not good news for the White House, but the clear indication is that the President's problems pre-date the current immigration crisis along the Mexican border or anything else that has happened this summer, and that those problems have not made things significantly worse for the President,"" Holland added. Obama drop started last year . Obama's numbers edged down during the late spring and summer of 2013 following controversies over the Edward Snowden intelligence leaks and congressional investigations into the IRS' alleged targeting of conservative political groups. Then came October and the politically charged botched rollout of the website for Obamacare, his signature domestic policy achievement. Coupled with legislative setbacks, many pundits labeled 2013 the worst year of Obama's presidency. And for the first time since taking over at the White House in 2009, a majority of the public surveyed disapproved of his job performance. Obama's approval ratings slightly rebounded earlier this year before edging down to their current standing in the low 40s in most national public opinion polling. The release of the new CNN poll comes after the crisis along the southern border dominated headlines for weeks. Prior to that controversy, the scandal rocking the Department of Veterans Affairs was in the media spotlight. The President is also facing two pressing international challenges: the bloody fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, and the shooting down of a Malaysian airliner over a part of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Prior to these two international flashpoints, Obama was dealing with the increased bloodshed in Iraq, the ongoing civil war in Syria, as well as the controversial swapping of five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay for the release of a U.S. soldier held captive in Afghanistan. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International from July 18-20, with 1,012 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.","President Obama's approval rating is 42% in new CNN/ORC International poll .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The new chief of Pakistan's spy agency will urge the United States to end drone strikes on Pakistani soil and identify targets that the country's security forces can then attack, a senior intelligence official said. Lt. Gen. Zahirul Islam will deliver the message during a meeting with the head of the CIA on August 2, said the Pakistani intelligence official, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. ""You (the U.S.) develop a target and let us hit it,"" Islam will tell CIA Director David Petraeus, the official said. ""It would be ideal if the U.S. provides drone technology to Pakistan."" Islam's call will continue an ongoing refrain from Pakistan about the CIA's controversial drone program. Pakistani officials and lawmakers have demanded an immediate end to the drone strikes, saying they have led to civilian deaths. In keeping with its general policy, the CIA would not comment on meetings between the director and senior officials from other states, including whether the Pakistani intelligence chief was coming to Washington. But a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing intelligence matters, said the United States ""supports the Pakistanis taking more responsibility for ridding the tribal areas of al Qaeda and its militant allies."" ""The Pakistanis clearly have had, and will have, opportunities to show they are serious about taking actions with a practical effect on rooting out terrorists,"" the official said, adding there were ""several actions"" Pakistan could take to get rid of al Qaeda, the Pakistani arm of the Taliban and the Haqqani network -- a Pakistan-based militant group blamed for numerous attacks on U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan.

"Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (CNN) -- Lawyers for Khalid Sheik Mohammed and four other prisoners charged in the September 11 attacks say the FBI has questioned more members of the Guantanamo Bay detainees' defense team than were previously disclosed. That could mean further delays in proceedings against the five accused of plotting the 2001 terrorist attacks. A court is hearing pretrial motions to prepare for the trial of Mohammed, who's been called the 9/11 mastermind, and the four others. Defense attorneys revealed the new information at a news conference at the U.S. naval base Sunday. Defense lawyers have previously said that the FBI approached one defense security officer, who was asked to become an informant. The U.S. Justice Department has acknowledged the contact and said investigators looked into whether someone on the defense team representing defendant Ramzi bin al-Shibh may have aided unauthorized communication between him and people overseas. The investigation was closed with no charges being brought. Lawyers for the defense team said Sunday that their investigation revealed that the FBI asked three other members of the defense team to cooperate and not to reveal that they were approached. They said a second investigation also has been closed with no charges. Hearings this week at Guantanamo Bay are expected to deal with the FBI investigations to see if there's a conflict of interest. Defense attorneys said they are preparing new pretrial motions to deal with the fallout from the FBI investigations. ""One of the scenarios is that one or more of the defense teams would have to be replaced,"" said James Connell, an attorney for one of the defendants. That could lead to even more delays in the case going to trial. The four people approached by the FBI had top-secret clearances, working with the defense teams to help them sort through classified information. Three of them worked for a security contracting company based in Washington.

"(CNN) -- Leandro Benitez scored both goals as Copa Libertadores winners Estudiantes de La Plata beat Pohang Steelers 2-1 in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday to book their place in the Club World Cup final. The Argentine side will now face either Barcelona or Atlante on Saturday after a turbulent second half at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium saw the South Korean side finish with just eight players. Benitez opened the scoring with a free-kick on the stroke of half-time, curling home a 25-yard strike that deceived goalkeeper Shin Hwa Yong. The same player doubled his account eight minutes after the break before things took a turn for the worse for the Asian champions when Hwang Jae-Won received a second yellow card three minutes after the goal. Brazilian striker Denilson made light of that loss to give his side a chance with a 71st-minute strike -- but within six minutes the Korean side had lost another two players. Kim Jae-Sung was first to go moments after the goal and keeper Shin followed five minutes later to leave Pohang with eight men.

"(CNN) -- J.K. Rowling still has some tricks up her sleeve. The ""Harry Potter"" author is returning to the world of wizards that made her famous, but it's not going to be with a new book -- and it's not going to feature The Boy Who Lived. J.K. Rowling revealed as secret author of crime novel . Instead, Rowling is going to make her screenwriting debut with a movie centered around one of Harry Potter's textbooks, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them,"" and the sojourns of its author, Newt Scamander. According to Rowling, she became intrigued with the idea after a proposal from studio Warner Bros. The author says in a statement that the studio (which shares a parent company with CNN) approached her ""with the suggestion of turning 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' into a film,"" which she thought could be interesting, but wasn't excited to see handled by another writer. After inspiration struck for what she could do with the story, she says she ended up pitching her own plot. ""Having lived for so long in my fictional universe, I feel very protective of it and I already knew a lot about Newt,"" Rowling says. ""As hard-core 'Harry Potter' fans will know, I liked him so much that I even married his grandson, Rolf, to one of my favorite characters from the 'Harry Potter' series, Luna Lovegood."" Not just J.K. Rowling: Best-selling female authors with male monikers . But while ""Fantastic Beasts"" pulls inspiration from the ""Potter"" universe, Rowling is very clear that this movie isn't a prequel or a sequel of that franchise, which ended with 2011's ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2."" Instead, with the project being ""set in the worldwide community of witches and wizards where I was so happy for 17 years,"" Rowling says it should be considered ""an extension of the wizarding world. The laws and customs of the hidden magical society will be familiar to anyone who has read the 'Harry Potter' books or seen the films, but Newt's story will start in New York, 70 years before Harry's gets under way.""

Entertainment has also entered into an ""expanded creative partnership"" with Rowling, which will cover projects like video games, digital initiatives and tourist attractions. For Warner Bros., this has to be a day of celebration. All told, the eight films produced based on Rowling's best-selling books have earned more than $7.7 billion worldwide, which by 2011 helped it edge out ""Star Wars"" as the top-grossing film series ever.","J.K.

"Washington (CNN) -- More emotion, aggressive leadership overseas, fresh ideas and active bipartisanship: That's the advice four former White House chiefs of staff have for President Obama as he faces the possibility of a Republican-controlled Senate and crises around the world and at home. Former Chiefs of Staff Bill Daley, who worked for Obama from 2011-12; Andrew Card from George W. Bush's White House; Mack McLarty of the Clinton administration; and Ken Duberstein, who worked for Ronald Reagan, sat down with Candy Crowley on Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" All four agreed that the twilight years of a two-term presidency hold drawbacks as well as opportunities. A lame-duck president, they argue, has the opportunity to search for fresh ideas and focus on what the country wants instead of politics. Reagan, Clinton and Bush were able to overcome a narrative of their irrelevancy, according to McLarty. ""I think there is a real opportunity as we've seen in each of these presidencies for the last two years for a lame duck indeed to fly, and there's such a demand and hunger by the American people for leadership to get something done."" Scandals within the Secret Service, the Ebola epidemic and the battle against ISIS fill today's headlines. It's also been a rocky midterm season for Democrats, with Obama's low approval ratings leading some Democratic candidates to keep their distance. In response to critics who say the President has not showed enough leadership in facing these issues, Daley said that if Obama appears as if he's phoning it in, it's a misperception. ""He knows that there are enormous challenges, things that he can control, things he can't: Ebola, ISIL. You've got to address them. It's not as though you can take off, and he knows this better than anyone."" However, Card pointed out that in politics, perceptions are paramount. ""I think he's got to be an aggressive and active leader in all of those categories -- and demonstrate some emotion and commitment that's real."" Card also warned the President away from appearing too consumed with partisan battles and to focus on leadership abroad. ""He kind of stepped on it this past week by basically saying this election is really a referendum on him,"" Card said, referencing a line from the President's speech Thursday. ""That message is not resonating with the American people."" Both Card and McLarty agreed that the President's focus on international leadership on the threat of ISIS, Ebola and relations with Russia is essential for a leader facing gridlock in Congress. ""He's already built an international coalition. He's already beginning to build the right pathway and demonstrate that leadership that the American people have such a strong desire for,"" McLarty said. Dubersteinsaid the President has an opportunity to turn over a new leaf. ""Every two-term president needs some fresh ideas, fresh voices and strong people."" The panel also sounded notes of optimism, saying a new Congress might be just want the President needs. According to Duberstein, trade and tax reform will be attractive issues where Republicans can show leadership. ""They have to demonstrate an ability to govern, the same way President Obama needs to reach out and start building relationships, not just with Democrats but with Republicans.""","Four former White House chiefs of staff officer the President advice .

"Pahoa, Hawaii (CNN) -- With a natural disaster playing out in slow motion as lava from Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii's Big Island inches towards homes and businesses in Pahoa, officials are preparing to begin evacuations. The 2,000-degree river of molten rock is advancing on up to 12 homes and businesses, Darryl Oliviera, director of the Hawaii County Civil Defense, told reporters on Tuesday. ""The last couple of days we've been going door-to-door, working with residents in the area, preparing them for an evacuation, and it's likely tonight we will begin some of those evacuations based on the conditions we are seeing,"" he said. ""For the most part, the residents have been preparing for this."" The evacuations, if they occur, would be among the first to take place since the slow-moving lava flow began moving towards Pahoa in June, when a volcanic crater vented and released the river of liquid rock. ""Our goal is to work with the residents and business owners, as the lava flow goes through their area,"" Oliviera said. ""There will be an opportunity for them to stay on site as long as it's safe to do so."" Lava chest high in some places . The dark ooze has swallowed up fences, flowed over a cemetery and neared major roads. On Tuesday morning, it set a wooden garden shed ablaze. In some places in this community of about 950 residents, the lava is chest high. ""Everybody, including myself, is quite nervous,"" Rod Macland told CNN affiliate KITV-TV. ""We don't know. We can't see the future. The flow does what the flow does."" By Tuesday morning, the lava was about 200 yards from the closest home and moving in a northeast direction. It was flowing 10 yards per hour, Darryl Oliveira of Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said. Hawaii officials haven't issued a mandatory evacuation yet. But many residents in the community have already chosen to leave on their own. ""Most people have vacated,"" Hawaii County Civil Defense worker Francesca Martin-Howe told CNN affiliate KHON-TV. ""They have moved out of their homes. There's only a few people left."" Alii Hauanio has started packing his things, including his parents' memorabilia, CNN affiliate KHNL reported. His mom and dad lost their dream Kalapana beach home to lava flow in 1991, and Hauanio never thought he'd see his home meet the same fate, he told the station. He hopes to watch the lava pass through, if it does. ""To see it, in actuality, I think it might bring closure to know that it's done and turn that page, and we're starting another chapter,"" Hauanio told KHNL. Oliveira said authorities weren't going to try to divert the flow. ""No matter how you would turn it, you would direct it toward someone's property,"" he said. There are about 40 to 50 homes in the first group of residences that are being threatened. Taking precautions . The lava flow is expected to displace 900 schoolchildren in the area. Residents who don't expect their homes to be destroyed worry about being cut off. ""A lot of us are loading up on gas, getting generators in case the energy goes out,"" Mike Hale told CNN. ""And we're checking to make sure the Internet stays up."" The Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency has rebuilt two gravel roads to give residents escape routes from the lava flow. Power company crews are installing 70-foot-tall poles with heat resistant protection to raise cables higher off the roads. Kristen Okinaka, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Electric Light Company, said there were no outages due to the lava flow. ""If for some reason someone can't get to our clinic, we will be there with the mobile unit,"" said Harold Wallace, CEO of Bay Clinic. ""There's going to be people who need prescriptions and more."" Smoke a problem . The smoke is a problem for residents, especially those with respiratory conditions. ""It's burning through thick brush, fern,"" Tim Orr, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist, told CNN affiliate KHNL-TV. ""A lot of smoke (is) coming off the front, a lot of cracking noises, methane explosions are going on. So it's a noisy situation out there just from all the burning vegetation."" Some evacuated homes are being targeted by looters, a business owner said. ""Crime is starting to pick up because a lot of people abandoned their houses. Two of my brother-in-laws' houses got ripped off,"" said Matt Purvis, owner of the Tin Shack Bakery, on Monday. But the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said it has received no reports of looting at evacuated houses or businesses. 'Not going to happen' Billy Kenoi, the Big Island mayor, said residents must work together. ""As it gets closer, the key is communication with the community, keeping people informed and everybody continue to work around the clock really hard just to minimize as much as possible the impact on the people of Pahoa,"" he told KHNL. But many residents are rolling with the punches. The lava flow is not exactly a surprise, since it started June 27 and has advanced about 13 miles since then. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes. ""I think it's going to be a little intense at first, a little crazy,"" resident Geri Tolchin told KITV. ""I think people will adjust. Everybody knows what's happening."" Macland said people must plan to rebuild. ""Everybody would wish this lava flow to stop,"" he told KITV, ""but it's not going to happen,"" CNN's Martin Savidge reported from Pahoa, Paul Vercammen from Los Angeles and Ralph Ellis from Atlanta. CNN's Michael Pearson and Steve Almasy also contributed to this report.","NEW: There will be an ""opportunity to stay"" as long as it is safe to do so, official says .

"(CNN) -- At least 40 people were killed in an airstrike on a key hospital in the besieged city of Aleppo, a rebel leader there told CNN. Ralib al-Omar, with the Yusif al-Asma rebel group, said the attack targeted the Dar al-Shifa Hospital and that the dead included two nurses. The hospital is one of the main sources of medical help for people in Syria's commercial hub. Video posted by activists showed a collapsed building adjacent to the hospital. The blast appeared to have hit the hospital's front lobby, which is often crowded with patients, civilians and rebels. The hospital had been attacked this year when an artillery shell hit its maternity ward.","The dead include two nurses, says rebel leader .

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal budget compromise that already passed the House cleared a key procedural hurdle on Tuesday in the Senate, increasing the likelihood it will win final Congressional approval this week. President Barack Obama has signaled his support for the plan worked out by the budget committee leaders in each chamber that would guide government spending into 2015 to defuse the chances of another shutdown such as the one that took place in October. Tuesday's vote overcame a Republican filibuster attempt that required 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to proceed on the budget measure. The count was 67-33, with a dozen Republicans joining the 55 Democrats and independents in support of the plan. 5 ways Senate could mess it up . Final approval in the Senate requires a simple majority of 51 votes. The budget plan easily passed the House last week on a 332-94 vote. GOP concerns . The politics of the issue were clear in Tuesday's vote breakdown. Only one Republican Senator facing a primary challenge in their re-election campaigns voted with Democrats to overcome the GOP filibuster -- Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Alexander has indicated he will oppose the budget plan in the final vote later this week. A new ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday showed 50% of respondents approving of the budget plan while 35% opposed it. According to the survey, a majority of Democrats and independents backed the proposal, while only 39% of Republicans liked it. Some Senate Republicans said before Tuesday's vote that the most important thing for now was to lower the budget deficit, even if only by a small percentage, and prevent further government shutdowns like the 16-day stoppage in October that proved politically damaging to the GOP. Sen. Ron Johnson, who was lobbied to support the bill negotiated by fellow Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, said he wanted ""to make sure we avoid any additional government shutdowns."" ""The federal government does enough harm to our economy,"" Johnson said. ""We don't need to add additional harm by this crisis management. In the end this is not the kind of deal I would want to see. I'm sure it's not the kind of deal Paul Ryan would want to produce."" Conservative GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said in a statement that ""sometimes the answer has to be yes."" ""Ultimately, his agreement upholds the principles conservatives stand for and, with Democrats controlling the White House and the Senate, it is the best we can hope for,"" he said of the plan Ryan negotiated with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington. CNN vote count: Budget deal nearing Senate approval, but not there yet . Final congressional approval of the elusive budget agreement would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a Congress infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem with midterm elections less than a year off. Democrats wary, too . While Democrats supported the bill, many had concerns. More liberal senators -- like Tom Harkin of Iowa -- complained that an unemployment benefit extension was not included in the deal. ""There's over a million people now who cannot find a job, out of work, and right at this time of year their unemployment insurance is being cut off,"" Harkin told Radio Iowa last week. ""It's really unconscionable."" Poll: Congress neck-and-neck with car salespeople, lobbyists for least honest . Budget deal . The budget agreement, which was months in the making, eases spending caps for the next two fiscal years while softening the impact of across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, on defense and non-defense programs. Overall, it calls for more than $20 billion in deficit reduction. Current federal spending expires in mid-January, raising the possibility of another shutdown at that time if there's not a new agreement in place to keep federal coffers filled. The strong vote in the House on the budget plan on Thursday brought a collective sigh of relief among supporters, who initially thought it would sail through the Senate, where bipartisanship has been more the norm than in the sharply divided House. Don't expect Boehner to totally change his tune . But after reading details of the agreement, many Senate Republicans -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill. ""I'd really like to stay within the (spending) caps,"" complained GOP Sen. John Boozman of Arkansas. ""This busts the caps and as a result I'll vote against it."" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina complained that the plan reduces military benefits. 2016 in play . Three leading tea party-backed senators with 2016 presidential aspirations -- Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Marco Rubio of Florida -- also have come out against the budget compromise for similar reasons. CNN's Dana Bash, Paul Steinhauser and Dan Merica contributed to this story.","NEW: A new poll shows public support for the budget deal .

"(CNN) -- Monday's Supreme Court ruling giving certain companies a right to raise religious objections to providing some types of birth control insurance to their employees leaves a number of important questions in its wake. And it's unlikely any will be answered soon following the 5-4 decision that sparked enormous reaction and analysis around abortion, Obamacare, and the influence of religion in conducting business in a secular marketplace. Here are five questions from the decision that was the most closely watched of this term. 1) What does the decision mean for Obamacare? Obamacare took a hit, but it remains intact. Unlike the blockbuster decision two years ago when the Supreme Court allowed the Affordable Care Act to proceed, this case dealt only with one part of it. That is a regulation requiring private, for-profit companies -- often family-owned businesses -- to provide certain types of birth control coverage to their employees without a copay. Looking ahead, the decision could serve as a primer for other pending challenges to the health law that was approved by Congress in 2010 without Republican support. Is it the first chip in a long legal slugfest? Fights over Obamacare will no doubt continue on a range of issues, from other employer mandates to tax breaks for those in the state health benefit exchanges that offer the insurance plans to consumers. 2) What is the impact of the ruling on workers? The White House says women employed by companies like the two firms at the center of the appeal -- arts-and-crafts retail giant Hobby Lobby and the much smaller Conestoga Wood Specialties -- have been hurt. And while the legal challenge was narrow, the potential impact is broader. The appeal applied to Plan B contraception, which some have called the ""morning after"" pill, and intrauterine devices or IUDs used by an estimated 2 million American women. In dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the decision ""sweeping."" Jonathan Turley, law professor at George Washington University, agreed. ""People should not get lost in the reference to 'closely held corporations.' These types of businesses ""are huge in this country and most of the businesses people relate with in their daily lives."" 3) What does it mean politically? The decision no doubt will energize Republicans on the campaign trail ahead of November midterm elections when control of the Senate is at stake. Republicans have made Obamacare a giant campaign target, especially with the conservative base and we got a taste of the politics behind it all quickly after the justices weighed in. ""Today's decision is a victory for religious freedom and another defeat for an administration that has repeatedly crossed constitutional lines in pursuit of"" big government, said House Speaker John Boehner. ""The President's health care law remains an unworkable mess and a drag on our economy."" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who heads the Democratic National Committee, framed the ruling as a campaign issue for the fall. ""It is no surprise that Republicans have sided against women on this issue as they have consistently opposed a woman's right to make her own health care decisions,"" she said, calling the ruling a ""dangerous precedent."" But some Democrats say there may be a silver lining: It could motivate younger women and unmarried women to show up at the polls. Exit polls indicate that unmarried and younger women support Democrats over Republicans, but their numbers also traditionally drop from presidential elections to midterm contests. 4) What's a ""religious"" company? Liberals and conservatives on the Supreme Court agreed on this much: the families that own Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties are undoubtedly religious. But does that make their companies religious? That's where the justices sharply disagreed. Writing for the majority, Samuel Alito said the government has little problem acknowledging that non-profits, like churches and charities, can be religious -- and exempting them from the contraception mandate if they have moral objections. So why should companies be held to a different standard? ""Any suggestion that for-profit corporations are incapable of exercising religion because their purpose is simply to make money flies in the face of modern corporate law,"" Alito writes. But there are big differences between charities and corporations, Ginsburg argued in her dissent. Religious organizations exist to further the interests of the faithful and usually employ workers or volunteers from their own community of believers. Companies, on the other hand, exist to make money, Ginsburg said, and by law are not allowed to discriminate in hiring based on religion. In fact, they often employ people of many faiths. So giving corporations religious rights opens a legal ""minefield,"" she argued. For instance, what's to stop employers from objecting to blood transfusions, as Jehovah's Witnesses do? Or vaccinations, as some Christian Scientists do? Or benefits for same-sex couples, as many evangelicals and Catholics do? 5) So what's next? The Obama administration immediately said it would work with Congress to ensure female employees get reproductive health coverage provided in the Affordable Care Act. But congressional action isn't realistic, considering the sharply partisan politics involved in Obamacare, abortion rights, and interpretations of religious freedom. Officials also hint that the President may use his executive authority to get around lawmakers in an election year. The practical result will likely be an administrative fix by the administration that subsidizes the contraceptives at issue, said CNN political analyst Gloria Borger. So far, 9 million people have signed up for Obamacare health plans since last October. CNN's Bill Mears, Paul Steinhauser, Tom Cohen, and Daniel Burke contributed to this report.","The decision leaves a number of questions in its wake .
What is the impact on Obamacare, and for future legal challenges?
What does it mean politically in a midterm year with control of the Senate at stake?

"(CNN) -- There's ""no risk of Ebola"" for a Dallas deputy who was hospitalized with possible symptoms of the virus, a Texas health official said Wednesday. The deputy, named by local media as Sgt. Michael Monnig, didn't have any direct contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the man who died of Ebola in Dallas on Wednesday. ""We know he didn't have direct contact with the patient (Duncan) and he doesn't have a fever, and in a situation like that there is no risk of Ebola,"" said Chris Van Deusen, spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. The patient -- who was transported from Frisco, Texas -- had reported being in the Dallas apartment where Duncan had been staying and having ""some contact"" with Duncan's family members, Frisco Fire Chief Mark Piland told reporters. Monnig was a first responder and had spent about 30 minutes in the apartment, his son told CNN affiliate KTVT. He woke up Wednesday, feeling sore and fatigued and with a stomachache. ""With the situation, what's happened, he just decided it would be better to be safe than sorry,"" Logan Monnig told KTVT. The family does not expect that Monnig has Ebola, but still, his son said, ""We're kind of scared and just want to make sure he's OK."" The patient was admitted to the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas ""after reporting possible exposure to the Ebola virus,"" the hospital said. ""Right now, there are more questions than answers about this case,"" the hospital said. ""Our professional staff of nurses and doctors is prepared to examine the patient, discuss any findings with appropriate agencies and officials."" Asked about the case by reporters, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden said the patient ""does not have either definite contact with Ebola or definite symptoms of Ebola."" A spokeswoman for CareNow, which made the call to emergency dispatchers, said the medical center ""was being very cautious"" after the patient checked yes in response to a screening question. In addition to Monnig, two other deputies from the department are feeling sick, Scott Guiselman, president of the Dallas Sheriff Fraternal Order of Police, told CNN's Erin Burnett. But state and local officials said they weren't aware of any other cases of Ebola-like symptoms. The new patient's case was the latest development as fears and concerns over Ebola spread worldwide. With multiple developments on numerous fronts, here's what you need to know to quickly get caught up on the latest: . WEST AFRICAN CASES . Grim tolls: . To date, the world's largest outbreak of Ebola has killed more than 3,400 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- the nations hardest hit.

"(CNN) -- The first 3D-printed toy plane will soon jet off to the stratosphere. The rocket-powered airplane will reach an altitude of between 25 and 30 kilometers (15 to 18 miles) -- three times higher than the cruising height of commercial airplanes. ""Without doubt, this is the most complicated amateur high-altitude mission ever undertaken,"" said Lester Haines, head of the Register's Special Projects Bureau that is behind the project. The components of the airplane have been designed by postgraduate students at the University of Southampton and produced using a 3D printer. ""We don't know quite what will happen when the big day arrives, but one thing's for sure -- it's going to be quite a show,"" Heines, who also holds the Guinness World Record for the highest launch of a paper aeroplane, added. It took the team four years, thousands of volunteer hours, and $60,000 from crowdfunding, to complete the ""Lohan."" The nickname is short for ""Low Orbit Helium Assisted Navigator"" and, its inventors say, a reference to the Hollywood star Lindsey Lohan. The rocket will launch from the Virgin Galactic spaceport in New Mexico later this year. A helium-filled meteorological balloon will lift the spaceplane to around 20 kilometers above the ground. Once it reaches that altitude, a rocket motor will fire and push the plane up to 25 kilometers. ""Its going to be doing some very smart things; collecting data from numerous sources, making decisions in real time, to form its trajectory and landing,"" said Guy Lipscombe from database software firm EXASOL, which sponsored the project. Once at the right altitude, the plane will switch to autopilot and glide back to earth, guided by a built-in GPS navigation system. At the end of its journey, the spaceplane will crash to the ground -- as it has no landing gear.","A 3D printed model airplane will reach between 25 and 30 kilometers .

When a fumigation plane flew over his farm in September 2010, mistakenly targeting his crops with coca eradication chemicals, his small cacao, yucca and plantain plants didn't stand a chance. Brown and crisp, they can no longer produce food. Joya, his four children and his pregnant wife, Olga, fled to a city slum more than eight hours away and prayed they would be able to return to lush green land someday. They are among Colombia's more than 3 million desplazados, or displaced population. The founders of Give Us Names, a nonprofit organization trying to turn an international spotlight on the plight of displaced farmers in Colombia, want to make sure Joya's voice is heard. ""We're an organization that believes in story telling as a means to bridge the gap between the United States and the developing world,"" Give Us Names co-director and editor Dan Roge said. Headquartered in Atlanta, Give Us Names released its first documentary, ""Leaving La Floresta,"" in September. It tells Joya's story in an effort to end displacement in Colombia caused by illicit crop fumigations. These aerial fumigations are heavily funded as a part of Plan Colombia, a complex $7.5 billion program started in 1999 during the Clinton administration. Plan Colombia supports the nation's efforts against the drug trade by investing in various military and anti-drug operations. ""The aerial eradication program run by the government of Colombia has been extraordinarily successful,"" said James Story, director of the Narcotic Affairs Section at the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá. He said coca cultivation in the South American country has decreased about 40% and cocaine production has dropped 60% since Plan Colombia's inception. He also said homicides are down by 50%, and terrorism and kidnappings are down more than 90%. Displacement in Colombia is extraordinarily complex, Story explained. He lists poverty, floods, land titling issues, violence over land, coca cultivation, and terrorism as a result of drug trafficking and child recruitment among the main drivers forcing people from their homes. ""When you take displacement out of the rather scientific and sterile ways we tend to talk about it, what you're really talking about is human beings that are being pulled away from their trades,"" Roge said. ""Things they know how to do, things that give them value ... and that is a deeply human and tragic issue of dignity."" According to a 2010 United Nations report, Colombia has the world's highest rate of internal displacement. ""We kept researching the top humanitarian crises in the world, and Colombia kept coming up again and again on the top of that list,"" documentary co-director Caleb Collier explained. Give Us Names spent months traveling, researching and filming in Colombia. ""We knew we wanted to get specific, to find a story to tell. We had searched for someone who would open their lives to us and tell us about the issue of displacement."" Give Us Names met Joya through a partner organization several months before his legal crops were fumigated. Their relationship helped narrow the organization's focus to displacement caused by fumigation. The documentary reports that Joya's neighbor's coca crop — plants whose leaves are processed to make cocaine — remained untouched by the herbicide. ""If your neighbor is growing coca, every attempt possible is made only to spray the coca itself,"" Story said. ""There is some drift that happens. It's very minimal, within 150 meters."" Story added that a complete system in place in Colombia allows people to file formal complaints through their municipal government. If the claims are verified by vigorous review, the farmers get economic redress for any legal crops that have been damaged by the spray program. Story said few of these receive compensation for a variety of reasons, such as late filing, mixed legal and illegal crops, or lack of evidence of spray. According to documents from the anti-narcotics division of Colombia's Policía Nacional, in 2004, only one complaint out of 874 received payment. In 2009, 4,442 complaints were filed. Redress was paid to 107 of those. There are few statistics detailing what percentage of displacement is caused by fumigations. CODHES, a Colombian human rights nonprofit organization, estimates that 60% to 70% of displaced people from the Guaviare region in 2007 and 2008 were linked to erroneous fumigations. ""Trying to get at the exact number of people who've been displaced because of spray event is very difficult,"" Story said. He placed a loose estimate at less than one-quarter of 1%. Out of the nearly 3.5 million desplazados, that's fewer than 9,000 people. Story also said USAID has invested $2.5 million in areas like La Floresta, where it works with 5,000 displaced people. ""Certainly, our program has spent over $1.2 million focused on providing economic redress for those people who've been affected wrongly by the spray program,"" he said. ""It's a very rare and unfortunate thing that happens. Each individual case is a tragedy in itself."" ""Leaving La Floresta"" also explores alternative solutions. Give Us Names partners with other organizations to place displaced farmers in co-operative-style communities. ""We want something better for Abelardo,"" Collier said. ""And because we want something better for Abelardo, we're gonna work to make sure it happens. So we're storytellers, but we're characters within that story at the same time."" Give Us Names insists it isn't criticizing the Colombian government. ""We're not attacking them at all,"" Collier said. ""We're saying on our side as U.S. citizens, we see that our policy's not going the way it should be. So let's talk with the Colombian government, the U.S. government, with different NGOs on the ground, and see what are the best ways to move forward."" Acción Social, the government entity that assists displaced people, said it does not consider these types of displaced farmers among its statistics. CNN's Andrés Gay and Wes Little contributed to this report.","A new documentary shows the plight of displaced farmers in Colombia .

"(ESSENCE.com) -- During this time of economic uncertainty, some historically black colleges and universities are being hit hard as they try to stave off foreclosures, layoffs and dwindling enrollments. Carlton E. Brown is the president of Clark Atlanta University, a historically black university in Georgia. Now Georgia state Sen. Seth Harp, a Republican, says he knows how to ease racial tensions while cutting costs in a state known as a mecca for historically black colleges and universities: merge black institutions with white ones. ESSENCE asked Carlton E. Brown, president of Clark Atlanta University, whether HBCUs can weather the storm. The following is an edited version of that interview: . ESSENCE: There have been rumors about Georgia's HBCUs downsizing. What's really happening? Carlton Brown: The most important thing to understand is that nothing is happening to HBCUs that is not also happening to every other institution in America. All of our major donors have been calling us this year, informing us that they have been losing money. This past fall, we enrolled 200 fewer students than we expected, not because of a lack of desire to attend but because of their inability to meet the bill.  ESSENCE: 'House of Payne' star graduating . ESSENCE: What is the response from African-Americans to this merger proposal from Republican state Sen. Seth Harp? Brown: When things are going well, people become comfortable. You might even say complacent.   Watch what HBCUs are saying about Obama's budget cuts » . When these issues are raised, they begin to naturally react and think about all the differences that these institutions make in the lives of communities. These institutions pride themselves on building the kind of relationships with students that are transformative. ESSENCE: Do you feel as if this proposal is a political or economic issue? Brown: It's become both. In a time of economic decline, everyone looks for what they think is a reduction in cost. It's like reducing your police force. But by that kind of reduction, you increase unrecoverable costs: There is more death and destruction. The same thing is true when you're talking about these kinds of institutions. ESSENCE: Is there another answer to save money other than merging? Brown: The bottom line is that states should be called to support these institutions at the level that they should have been supporting them the last 100-plus years. ESSENCE: ACORN in the hot seat again . ESSENCE: What's your take on Sen. Harp's explanation that the merger would end signs of Jim Crow segregation? Brown: I would oppose that. At the point of desegregation, the logical and just approach would have been to close the white institutions, which existed to perpetuate discrimination. ESSENCE: Weighing in on the HBCU controversy . ESSENCE: If the proposal becomes reality, what do you think it would mean for HBCUs?

"(CNN) -- The parents of a missing Missouri girl have refused to be interviewed separately by authorities, Kansas City police said Wednesday. But the attorney representing Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley, parents of 11-month-old Lisa Irwin, said the couple is not opposed to separate interviews, but do not want what police requested -- an unrestricted interview with no attorneys present. ""Being questioned separately is not the issue,"" said attorney Cyndy Short. She said the couple has been cooperative and has previously been interviewed separately as well as together. They don't mind being interviewed separately as long as the detectives are fair, open-minded and non-accusatory, she said. Lisa was reported missing about 4 a.m. October 4, after her father, Jeremy Irwin, arrived home from work to find the door unlocked, the lights on and a window that had been tampered with. The girl's mother, Deborah Bradley, said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the night before. Kansas City police Capt. Steve Young said Tuesday investigators had planned to conduct the separate parent interviews, but said Wednesday the couple had declined. Young said he did not dispute reports that the family had cooperated and answered questions, but the police department detectives still had unanswered questions. Meanwhile, Lisa's half-brothers, who were in the family's home the night she disappeared, will be re-interviewed by authorities on Friday, Kansas City police said Wednesday. The boys will be interviewed by a ""child services specialist trained to interview kids,"" Young said. The interview will be non-confrontational, he said, and a police officer won't even be in the room. ""Not an interrogation,"" he said. ""They are kids, after all."" The boys are 8 and 6, Short said. Young said they were previously interviewed just after Lisa disappeared, both for under an hour. Details were being worked out for a re-interview of the boys, Short said. Bradley said in an NBC interview last week that she was drunk the night Lisa disappeared and that she had last seen the baby about four hours earlier than initially reported. The couple said in the same interview they had refused to let authorities re-interview Lisa's older brothers. ""They said they heard noises (the night Lisa disappeared),"" Bradley said. ""I don't know if that was before we went to sleep or after."" She said she had not talked to her sons about it because she was reluctant to put them through ""anything else."" The couple's oldest son is Jeremy Irwin's, and their middle son is Bradley's son, Short told CNN in an interview Monday. ""Lisa was the little girl that was going to hold this family together,"" Short said, adding the child was wanted, looked forward to and ""well-loved."" Asked about Bradley's admission that she was drinking the night Lisa vanished, Short said Bradley did what a lot of parents do when their children are in bed -- shared some drinks with a friend. ""It's just not that unusual until your life gets turned upside down,"" she said. Authorities had expressed frustration early in the investigation after Lisa's parents stopped cooperating with investigators, Young had said. However, a family spokeswoman attributed the frustration to ""miscommunication,"" and meetings with the toddler's parents resumed shortly afterward. A cadaver dog searching the family's Kansas City home indicated a positive ""hit"" for the scent of a body, according to documents released Friday. On that information, Short said that law enforcement typically begins such investigations inside the home, then if warranted the probe moves outside the family. ""We don't know exactly what happened here, so we need to keep broadening the investigation,"" she said, adding she is hopeful that the investigation is going in that direction. Between 30 and 50 investigators, including police and FBI personnel, were involved in the search as of Tuesday, the Kansas City Police Department said. Some 900 tips had been received by investigators, the department said. Surveillance video surfaced over the weekend from a BP gas station less than two miles from the family's home, showing an unidentified person walking along the road about 2:15 a.m. October 4. The station's manager, Anuj Arora, said it's unusual to see anyone walking at that time of night in the area. On what Lisa's parents believe happened to their daughter, Short said, ""They don't know. I mean, someone came into their home in the middle of the night and took their beloved child away from them ... They are stumped."" She said the couple has provided a wealth of information to police, including the names of people who have had access to their home. Lisa's parents want people to continue looking for the child, she said. ""We are praying and hoping. Hope is alive for us.""","NEW: Attorney: parents will not agree to an unrestricted interview without attorneys .

"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (CNN) -- Authorities in this violence-plagued border city Thursday were investigating a series of attacks the day before that left 14 people dead, including four people who were slain aboard an ambulance. Among the attacks Wednesday, gunmen ambushed an ambulance that was transporting two dialysis patients to a hospital in Juarez, police said. The driver of the ambulance and another person traveling with the group also died in the attack. Photos from the scene showed a dusty white ambulance with the passenger-side window shot out, blood smeared across the car door and bullet marks on the windshield. The ambulance traveled to Juarez from the city of Nuevo Casas Grandes, about 170 miles away, police said. Juarez, one of Mexico's most violent cities, shares a border with El Paso, Texas. The border city has become a symbol of the brutal realities of the nation's drug war, which has claimed about 43,000 lives since President Felipe Calderon declared a crackdown on cartels in December 2006. Crime rates in Juarez have declined since last year, with the daily homicide rate dropping from about eight in 2010 to six in 2011. Chacon reported this story from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Valencia wrote the story in Atlanta.","Police say gunmen ambushed an ambulance .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- At the bus terminal in downtown Los Angeles, they're easy to spot. Dressed in blue jeans, they carry boxes, bags or large envelopes with their name and a number on it. They are ex-offenders, just released from California's prison system. When they step off the bus with $200 in ""gate money"" in their pockets, many have hopes of making a fresh start. But in this seedy area just blocks from Skid Row, the new arrivals are easy targets for pimps and drug dealers. For some, the temptation is too much. While not everyone succumbs to the streets so quickly, nearly 60 percent return to prison within three years, according to California's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. It's a cycle that Susan Burton is striving to break through her reentry program. Having served six prison terms for drug offenses in the 1980s and '90s, Burton knows from experience how hard it can be. ""Every time I was released, I swore I wasn't going back,"" said Burton, 57. ""But I know now that without the resources and support, it's next to impossible. ... If you don't have a new door to walk through, the only thing is the old door."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . A new door is what Burton's program -- A New Way of Life Reentry Project -- gives to just-released female offenders. By providing a sober place to live and other support services, she's helped more than 400 women get back on their feet. Burton was raised in the projects in East L.A., and her own life took a turn for the worse when her 5-year-old son was accidentally hit and killed by a car in 1981. Amid her grief, she started smoking crack cocaine and ended up in prison -- beginning a pattern of addiction and incarceration that continued for years. ""I couldn't get off the turnstile,"" Burton said. ""I knew I had a problem but didn't understand the complexity."" Burton ultimately got clean at a rehab facility in 1997 and realized she wanted to help other women offenders when they were released. She worked as a live-in caregiver and saved up enough money to buy a house in Watts. She put bunk beds in the bedrooms, converted the breakfast nook into a bedroom/office for herself, and at the end of 1998, she opened her doors. Right away, her program took off. ""Magic happened,"" she said. ""There were 10 women in the house, just working together, helping each other, recovering together."" Today, Burton -- now a certified dependency counselor -- has five houses and supports up to 22 women at a time, largely with funding from a variety of private foundations. She receives 20 to 30 letters a week from inmates and answers each one, promising them a place to stay. Burton personally picks up most new arrivals at the bus station or at the prison gates, greeting them with a simple ""welcome home."" ""To me, there's this real window of opportunity to get people from incarceration into a positive lifestyle,"" she said. She and her group provide food, clothing and transportation, along with helping them register for benefits, get ID cards so they can find work and begin regaining custody of their children. In return, Burton asks that residents stay clean, attend 12-step meetings, and enroll in school, get drug treatment or find work. She also asks them to contribute $500 a month when they can, but says she won't turn anyone out as long as they're making progress. When the women are ready to live independently, Burton finds them housing and helps furnish their homes. It's a formula that seems to achieve results. According to Burton, 75 percent of women who enter the program stay clean and don't return to prison for at least 18 months. Charsleen Poe is just one of Burton's many success stories. ""When I came here ... the only thing I knew to look for next was a hit,"" said Poe, 50, who struggled with addiction and homelessness for 15 years. But in the 18 months since she entered Burton's program, she's stayed sober, taken computer classes and is now looking for a job and her own place to live. ""Today, I am not that same person that I was,"" Poe says. ""Miss Burton made me want to change my life."" Burton's program may be needed even more in the future. In August 2009, federal judges ruled that California's prisons were overcrowded and ordered a release of 40,000 inmates over the next two years. The state is appealing, but it seems likely that more prisoners will be released, at a time when state-funded rehabilitation programs for inmates are being cut. Burton worries about how inmates will deal with these new challenges and said she is constantly looking for new ways to help ex-offenders succeed. She runs a clinic with UCLA's law school that helps expunge people's records so they can find work more easily and encourages all of her residents to become politically active. ""I want the women to realize that ... they have something to contribute,"" she said. For Burton, her hard work ""is giving life, hope, courage to people to give back to the world,"" she said. ""I just wanted my life to count towards something good, and this was the way I could do it."" Want to get Involved?

"(WIRED) -- The tributes to Dennis Ritchie won't match the river of praise that spilled out over the web after the death of Steve Jobs. But they should. And then some. ""When Steve Jobs died last week, there was a huge outcry, and that was very moving and justified. But Dennis had a bigger effect, and the public doesn't even know who he is,"" says Rob Pike, the programming legend and current Googler who spent 20 years working across the hall from Ritchie at the famed Bell Labs. On Wednesday evening, with a post to Google+, Pike announced that Ritchie had died at his home in New Jersey over the weekend after a long illness, and though the response from hardcore techies was immense, the collective eulogy from the web at large doesn't quite do justice to Ritchie's sweeping influence on the modern world. Dennis Ritchie is the father of the C programming language, and with fellow Bell Labs researcher Ken Thompson, he used C to build UNIX, the operating system that so much of the world is built on -- including the Apple empire overseen by Steve Jobs. CNN's GeekOut blog: Without Ritchie, you wouldn't be reading this . ""Pretty much everything on the web uses those two things: C and UNIX,"" Pike tells Wired. ""The browsers are written in C. The UNIX kernel â€” that pretty much the entire Internet runs on -- is written in C. Web servers are written in C, and if they're not, they're written in Java or C++, which are C derivatives, or Python or Ruby, which are implemented in C. And all of the network hardware running these programs I can almost guarantee were written in C. ""It's really hard to overstate how much of the modern information economy is built on the work Dennis did."" Even Windows was once written in C, he adds, and UNIX underpins both Mac OS X, Apple's desktop operating system, and iOS, which runs the iPhone and the iPad. ""Jobs was the king of the visible, and Ritchie is the king of what is largely invisible,"" says Martin Rinard, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. ""Jobs' genius is that he builds these products that people really like to use because he has taste and can build things that people really find compelling. Ritchie built things that technologists were able to use to build core infrastructure that people don't necessarily see much anymore, but they use everyday."" From B to C . Dennis Ritchie built C because he and Ken Thompson needed a better way to build UNIX. The original UNIX kernel was written in assembly language, but they soon decided they needed a ""higher level"" language, something that would give them more control over all the data that spanned the OS. Around 1970, they tried building a second version with Fortran, but this didn't quite cut it, and Ritchie proposed a new language based on a Thompson creation known as B. Depending on which legend you believe, B was named either for Thompson's wife Bonnie or BCPL, a language developed at Cambridge in the mid-60s. Whatever the case, B begat C. B was an interpreted language -- meaning it was executed by an intermediate piece of software running atop a CPU -- but C was a compiled language. It was translated into machine code, and then directly executed on the CPU. But in those days, C was considered a high-level language. It would give Ritchie and Thompson the flexibility they needed, but at the same time, it would be fast. That first version of the language wasn't all that different from C as we know it today -- though it was a tad simpler. It offered full data structures and ""types"" for defining variables, and this is what Richie and Thompson used to build their new UNIX kernel. ""They built C to write a program,"" says Pike, who would join Bell Labs 10 years later. ""And the program they wanted to write was the UNIX kernel."" Ritchie's running joke was that C had ""the power of assembly language and the convenience of ... assembly language."" In other words, he acknowledged that C was a less-than-gorgeous creation that still ran very close to the hardware. Today, it's considered a low-level language, not high. But Ritchie's joke didn't quite do justice to the new language. In offering true data structures, it operated at a level that was just high enough. ""When you're writing a large program -- and that's what UNIX was -- you have to manage the interactions between all sorts of different components: all the users, the file system, the disks, the program execution, and in order to manage that effectively, you need to have a good representation of the information you're working with. That's what we call data structures,"" Pike says. ""To write a kernel without a data structure and have it be as consist and graceful as UNIX would have been a much, much harder challenge. They needed a way to group all that data together, and they didn't have that with Fortran."" At the time, it was an unusual way to write an operating system, and this is what allowed Ritchie and Thompson to eventually imagine porting the OS to other platforms, which they did in the late 70s. ""That opened the floodgates for UNIX running everywhere,"" Pike says. ""It was all made possible by C."" Apple, Microsoft and beyond . At the same time, C forged its own way in the world, moving from Bell Labs to the world's universities and to Microsoft, the breakout software company of the 1980s. ""The development of the C programming language was a huge step forward and was the right middle ground ... C struck exactly the right balance, to let you write at a high level and be much more productive, but when you needed to, you could control exactly what happened,"" says Bill Dally, chief scientist of NVIDIA and Bell Professor of Engineering at Stanford. ""[It] set the tone for the way that programming was done for several decades."" As Pike points out, the data structures that Richie built into C eventually gave rise to the object-oriented paradigm used by modern languages such as C++ and Java. The revolution began in 1973, when Ritchie published his research paper on the language, and five years later, he and colleague Brian Kernighan released the definitive C book: The C Programming Language. Kernighan had written the early tutorials for the language, and at some point, he ""twisted Dennis' arm"" into writing a book with him. Pike read the book while still an undergraduate at the University of Toronto, picking it up one afternoon while heading home for a sick day. ""That reference manual is a model of clarity and readability compared to latter manuals. It is justifiably a classic,"" he says. ""I read it while sick in bed, and it made me forget that I was sick."" Like many university students, Pike had already started using the language. It had spread across college campuses because Bell Labs started giving away the UNIX source code. Among so many other things, the operating system gave rise to the modern open source movement. Pike isn't overstating it when says the influence of Ritchie's work can't be overstated, and though Ritchie received the Turing Award in 1983 and the National Medal of Technology in 1998, he still hasn't gotten his due. As Kernighan and Pike describe him, Ritchie was an unusually private person. ""I worked across the hall from him for more than 20 years, and yet I feel like a don't knew him all that well,"" Pike says. But this doesn't quite explain his low profile. Steve Jobs was a private person, but his insistence on privacy only fueled the cult of personality that surrounded him. Ritchie lived in a very different time and worked in a very different environment than someone like Jobs. It only makes sense that he wouldn't get his due. But those who matter understand the mark he left. ""There's that line from Newton about standing on the shoulders of giants,"" says Kernighan. ""We're all standing on Dennis' shoulders.""

"(Health.com) -- The rituals of college -- making new friends, studying until dawn, excessive partying -- can stress out any young adult. But students with bipolar disorder, or those at risk for the condition, are even more vulnerable in a college environment. Academic pressures, social concerns, and sleep disruptions can lead to bouts of depression as well as mania, the euphoric, revved-up state characteristic of bipolar disorder. Without the right treatment and support, bipolar college students face higher dropout rates, drug and alcohol abuse, and even suicide. ""The new structure and new stresses for [bipolar] students who leave home to go to school sometimes can trigger problems and relapses,"" says Dr. Richard Kadison, M.D., the chief of mental health services at Harvard University and the author of ""College of the Overwhelmed: The Campus Mental Health Crisis and What to Do About It."" Health.com: 5 relapse triggers to watch for . These stresses, he adds, can also trigger mania in students who have an underlying vulnerability to bipolar disorder. ""Oftentimes, the first manic episode occurs in college,"" Kadison says. At its most severe, bipolar disorder is a dangerous condition that can lead to psychotic episodes and hospitalization. Milder forms of the disorder can cause problems as well, and can interfere with academic success. A 2006 study in the Journal of Affective Disorders compared a group of bipolar adults with a group of healthy adults who had similar IQs and social backgrounds. More than 60 percent of both groups entered college, but their achievements differed greatly: Nearly half of the control group received a college degree, compared to just 16 percent of the bipolar group. Students with bipolar disorder can survive -- and even thrive -- in college, but doing so requires a plan. Taking the proper medications, arranging for the appropriate counseling and medical care on campus, avoiding drugs and alcohol, maintaining a steady sleep and study schedule, and finding sources of peer support are all crucial and can make the difference between achieving your goals and dropping out. Health.com: 9 strategies for controlling bipolar disorder . A breeding ground for bipolar symptoms . Jennifer, 24, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder during her senior year of high school in Rochester, N.Y., but it wasn't until she left the support of her family and went away to college that the disease threatened her life. During the first weeks of her freshman year, she felt isolated and alone. She quit the soccer team and stopped going to classes. She started to stockpile medications and alcohol. In October, she drove to a nearby apple orchard, downed the pills and alcohol, and passed out. She woke up in the hospital after spending three days in a coma. (A passerby had seen her taillights, found her unconscious, and rushed her to the hospital, where she was medevaced to a larger hospital.) Jennifer says she remembers being angry to be alive. ""I kept telling my family and friends that I was OK, but I was planning my suicide,"" says Jennifer, who later returned to the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. ""I had so much support back home -- and then, in this new place, I didn't even know where the counseling center was."" Numerous aspects of college life can trigger a manic or depressive episode. Sleep deprivation and the keeping of irregular hours -- both common practices on college campuses -- are known to trigger mania, while binge drinking and the use of substances such as marijuana can cause depression. Health.com: Booze, drugs, and bipolar disorder . Stress, whether it stems from the pressure to succeed academically or to fit in socially, can trigger mania as well. According to Russell Federman, Ph.D, the director of Counseling and Psychological Services at the University of Virginia student health center, the desire to fit in and conform to the college lifestyle can cause some bipolar students to abandon healthy behaviors -- even their medications. College life often reveals the symptoms of bipolar disorder for the first time, particularly for those at risk of the condition who have not yet been diagnosed. (The college years, in fact, overlap with the stage in life in which bipolar disorder typically first appears -- between 19 and 23 years old, according to some estimates.) James, 22, experienced his first manic episode at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. His lifestyle was less than healthy: In college he smoked a lot of marijuana and experimented with hallucinogenic mushrooms and a drug similar to LSD. He had a serious depressive episode his freshman year, and then, in the winter of his sophomore year, he entered a full-blown manic episode with psychosis. ""I thought I was having an existential breakthrough, but it was really a manic high,"" James says. Health.com: What is mania in bipolar disorder? Federman says that the symptoms of bipolar disorder do not appear spontaneously. ""The lifestyle irregularities and the stresses of college life don't in and of themselves cause bipolar disorder,"" he explains. ""You need a genetic vulnerability for bipolar disorder to emerge. But if you've got that vulnerability, the lifestyle irregularities of the first and second year of college can certainly be a precipitant."" Strategies for managing bipolar disorder . Students who have been diagnosed with a bipolar spectrum disorder can take steps to minimize the risk of a relapse and stay balanced. Perhaps the most important step is to make sure you have a support system at school, which usually means connecting with the medical and counseling staff on campus. Students who attend school away from home may choose to maintain contact with their existing psychiatrist, but experts urge students to also make contact with campus health services. ""Even if a student with bipolar disorder has what they consider to be their primary health provider at home, they need to have someone at college as well,"" says Elizabeth Gong-Guy, Ph.D, the director of counseling and psychological services at UCLA. ""And if a student with bipolar disorder is looking at a college in a rural community, they need to be proactive about what their local access to psychiatric care will be."" Having a psychiatrist close at hand isn't important only for emergencies. In fact, bipolar students who have been stabilized on medication while at home may need to fine-tune their prescriptions while at school. ""Students sometimes need adjustments to their medication in the new environment,"" Kadison says. ""It varies a lot, depending on the resiliency of the student, the supports that are already in place, and how much of an academic challenge the student is facing."" Health.com: How the right drugs can treat bipolar disorder . Campus health services also provide counseling, which can help students cope with the emotional stress of living with bipolar disorder. Just as important, counseling can teach students everyday strategies for managing their symptoms. In his 2010 book, ""Facing Bipolar: The Young Adult's Guide to Dealing With Bipolar Disorder"", Federman outlines what he calls the ""four S's of bipolar stability"": structure, stress management, sleep management, and self-monitoring. This framework entails setting -- and sticking to -- a regular schedule of studying and sleep, and learning to recognize the signs that you are beginning to drift into mania or hypomania. Stacy, 26, who graduated from Rutgers University in May 2008, has what her doctor calls bipolar type III, a diagnosis that typically describes a form of hypomania associated with antidepressants. Health.com: Bipolar is one disorder with many faces . Dealing with depressive episodes in college, Stacy never knew when she was going to crash, so she made sure to do her assignments well ahead of time. She also talked to her professors on the first day of class about her mental health and documented her case at disability services on campus. Students tend to associate such resources with physical disabilities, but these centers often help students with mental health disorders as well. ""I felt OK about sharing with professors, and they were great about working with me,"" Stacy says. ""Be prepared to encounter people who don't understand, but try to get the college behind you."" Other sources of support on campus In addition to campus health services, peer counseling can be a valuable source of support. Jennifer began leading a National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) support group on her campus because she doesn't want students to feel as alone as she did her freshman year. She advises students with mental illness to reach out. ""We want to make people more aware of the counseling office at orientation,"" she says. ""One of our major messages is, 'You are not alone.'"" Health.com: Avoiding the stigma of depression and bipolar disorder . James took a semester off from school and spent a summer at a community college near his home before returning to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in the fall of 2008. As a senior, he communicated often with his doctor and parents, a strategy that helped him remain stable. He tried to schedule his classes in the middle of the day to facilitate a regular sleep schedule, and he did his best to avoid alcohol and drugs. However, he struggled to find a group of peers who have dealt with mental health problems. In addition to NAMI, an organization called Active Minds is trying to open the dialogue about mental illness on college campuses. Founded by Alison Malmon in 2001, following the suicide of her older brother, the organization now has more than 200 chapters nationwide. Active Minds organizes events such as National Day Without Stigma and has partnered with the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance to create peer support groups on college campuses.

"(CNN) -- Air travelers usually are prepared for the occasional hectic and overcrowded flight. But all are hoping they'll at least be able to sit down. Arthur Berkowitz, 57, stood for the length of his US Airways flight in July after a fellow passenger occupied half of his seat. The non-stop flight from Anchorage to Philadelphia lasted seven hours. ""I didn't fly from Alaska to Philadelphia,"" Berkowitz said on consumer advocate Christopher Elliott's blog, Elliott.org. ""I stood."" CNN recently reported on the extensive flight delays that travelers experienced during last month's snowstorm. JetBlue has begun reimbursing those customers for their eight-hour tarmac waits, and Berkowitz feels US Airways should do more to address the issue of his extended standing. He initially had an empty seat next to him on Flight 901, but a late passenger sat there and took more space than he paid for. ""His size required both armrests to be raised up and allowed for his body to cover half of my seat,"" Berkowitz said. The man was very polite and expressed regret over the situation, said Berkowitz, who notified the flight crew that he was unable to fasten his seat belt and asked if he could move to business class. As the flight was filled to capacity, and as passengers are not permitted to sit in the flight attendants' jump seats, Berkowitz found himself strolling through the cabin for hours. Flight attendants apparently asked him to remain seated and fasten his seat belt, but he said the co-passenger was seated on his seat belt fastener, making this impossible. That meant that, though he did manage to wedge himself into his seat for the takeoff and landing, he was unable to comply with the requirement that his seat belt be fastened at those times. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen told CNN that it also is against regulations to stand for an entire flight and that passengers are always encouraged to remain in their seats. US Airways issued a statement saying it recognizes the inconvenience of the situation. ""We all understand how sensitive a subject passengers of size can present, but we should never compromise safety and we need every passenger to help us ensure that every flight operates safely by complying with those crew members' instructions."" When the plane landed, Berkowitz said, he immediately contacted a US Airways agent who referred him to the company headquarters in Phoenix. Though the airline offered him a $200 voucher for his trouble, Berkowitz said, he did not accept it. After months of unsuccessful communication, he said, he went to the FAA, which notified him that US Airways considered the matter closed. CNN could not independently confirm the details. Although he is disappointed at the amount he was offered, Berkowitz said, his motivation for speaking out now is not financial. ""My reason for bringing this up is strictly and solely for the airline to look at their safety procedures,"" he told CNN. Although US Airways expresses regret over the situation, the airline does feel the matter has been resolved and that Berkowitz's concerns have been noted. ""We have attempted to address this customer's service concerns, but offering increasing amounts of compensation based on a threat of a safety violation isn't really fair -- especially when the passenger himself said he didn't follow the crew members' instructions and fasten his seat belt,"" US Airways said in a written statement. ""If there was a safety issue -- we will address that professionally and with the proper attention toward preventing it from happening again. We have already provided feedback on the service issues with the team involved, and thank Mr. Berkowitz for making his concerns known."" Some airlines have policies in place to handle issues with ""passengers or customers of size."" According to its website, Southwest Airlines requires customers who do not fit in their seats (which are 17 inches wide) to purchase an extra seat before boarding, but will refund them for the seat if the flight is not full. AirTran, which is being purchased by Southwest, has the same policy. Continental and United require passengers to be able to lower their armrests and fasten their seat belt with no more than one seat belt extender. Delta requires that passengers lower their armrests and fasten their seat belt with no extenders. Passengers may be required to purchase an additional seat if they fall outside of this protocol. US Airways has a policy that allows for extenders, or booking the passenger on a later flight. If neither is possible, the passenger may be charged for an additional seat. Berkowitz's grievances extend to the gate crew members who didn't do more to follow this policy.","Arthur Berkowitz says he was forced out of his seat by the ""passenger of size"" beside him .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Noble is one of the best companies in the world at managing the sourcing, processing and transportation of raw materials, whether they are coal or food grains. Richard Elman, the founder and CEO of the Noble Group . It has been a long journey for its founder, Richard Elman, who began the company 20 years ago, he says, simply to make a living. From $100,000 of his own money, he has grown Noble Group into a $15 billion supply chain management business with offices in over 40 countries. Not bad for a man, who at the tender age of 15, decided to drop out of school and start his career working in a scrapmetal yard. CNN's Andrew Stevens caught up with Elman at his Hong Kong headquarters, and began by asking why he chose work over the classroom. Elman: Total failure in school -- I didn't have a choice. You have to be pragmatic. When you fail all your O levels what else do you do with your life? I actually didn't have a clue what to do with my life. And my parents had found this job for me and I took to it naturally, I suppose. And I have not looked back since. Stevens: Your parents found you the job; was there an element of you which had to fight against disappointment perhaps, your father obviously a high achiever? Elman: Oh, my father -- it took me many years to build a level stage with my father. He was hugely disappointed. He was highly intellectual. But ultimately I think he recognized, in the latter part of his life, suddenly I had some success and I think, actually, he was quite proud. Stevens: Was it a difficult relationship, in the early days after you left school, with your father? Elman: Well, he was just disappointed, you know. He taught me something which is probably true and I try to pass it to my kids. Whatever happens in life, you cannot take away education. So if you are trained as a barrister or a lawyer, you can go anywhere in the world and make a living. If you only have physical possessions, they can be taken away from you depending on war or whatever may happen. Stevens: We have had the Asian economic crisis, we have had a lot of downs, what lessons have you taken away from all that, those lessons of adversity? Elman: I think you just have got to look forward. You cannot look back. We have had the, probably the first big crisis that we had was the Tiananmen Square incident and that was a huge problem for us because I think 90 percent of our business was in China and one day we were closed down. Then we had the 1997 crisis and we had just listed in Singapore. And suddenly the stock had gone from 80 cents, or whatever it was down to 10 cents. Stevens: Let's just come back to Tiananmen Square for a moment. 90 percent of your business is in China, there is a crisis there. How did you react? Elman: Honestly? I called some people to the office on a Monday morning, I put out on a spread sheet our exposure in China. I took one look at it, I lifted all of the papers off my desk, threw them in the air and said ""This crisis is too big. Let's get on with the business."" It was as simple as that. Stevens: Nothing you could do. Elman: I didn't know how to control it. It was beyond me, certainly beyond me. But we carried on and we had some requests from certain people to continue shipping and certain people said could we assist them and pay some debt that they had to pay because the banks had been closed at the time and we did it. And that, I think, was fundamental to the future of the company, because we helped out people when they needed help, and people have respected that and helped us out as well, when we have needed help. So it was a good experience actually, at the end of the day. E-mail to a friend .","Richard Elman is the founder and CEO of the Noble Group .

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. Air Force plane serving as an airborne radio station is broadcasting messages to Haitians urging them not to attempt ocean voyages to the United States, saying they will be intercepted and turned back home if they do. The plane is broadcasting recorded messages from Raymond Joseph, Haiti's ambassador to the United States, and announcements of where earthquake victims can go for food and aid. ""Listen, don't rush on boats to leave the country,"" Joseph says in Creole. ""If you do that, we'll all have even worse problems. Because, I'll be honest with you: If you think you will reach the U.S. and all the doors will be wide open to you, that's not at all the case. And they will intercept you right on the water and send you back home where you came from."" The EC-130J Commando Solo, a large transport aircraft, is flying and broadcasting five hours a day over Haiti, authorities said. In addition to the message from Joseph, it is broadcasting news from Voice of America and instructions on hygiene procedures to prevent disease. ""We are sending public service messages ... to save lives,"" said State Department deputy spokesman Gordon Duguid. ""It is part of the U.S. effort to help keep Haitians safe. We don't want people to endanger their lives by taking risk to try to get to the U.S. at this time."" Haitians who have valid visas can come to the United States on commercial flights. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security has activated a task force to review plans on how to respond to a mass migration from Haiti if necessary. But officials stressed that the measures are being taken out of an abundance of caution. ""We're actively looking for signs that the citizens of Haiti [are migrating by sea] but right now there's no sign,"" said U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Christopher O'Neil. ""The only movement of people we've seen has been all inland."" O'Neil said a sea migration is unlikely ""if for no other reason than there's this massive federal government presence [in Haiti] trying to deliver humanitarian relief."" ""We've probably never had this great of a situational awareness of what's going on in Haiti as we do right now,"" he added. Full coverage | Twitter updates . The U.S. Coast Guard has five cutters off the Haiti coast focused on delivering humanitarian assistance, and is moving more into the area. Past mass migrations were sparked by geopolitical circumstances rather than natural disasters, O'Neil said. The federal government created a mass migration plan in 2004 after an uptick in migration from the Caribbean, and it regularly exercises the plan. More than 55 agencies participated in the last full-scale exercise, he said. ""Attempts to enter the United States by sea are inherently dangerous,"" he said. Migrants typically use crowded, poorly built boats and ""put themselves at the mercy of smugglers. ""It's simply a prudent measure [to activate the task force],"" he said. ""Given the situation and not wanting to be caught unprepared, it makes sense to at least look at the plan and make sure that the people in the appropriate agencies are ready and able to execute the plan if it's warranted."" Search list of missing and found . The phenomenon of Haitian migration in small boats and rafts dates back at least 35 years, according to a Congressional Research Service report. Most notably, an estimated 25,000 Haitians were among the mass migration of more than 150,000 asylum seekers who arrived in South Florida during the Mariel boatlift, an exodus of mostly Cuban migrants in 1980.

"New York (CNN) -- When asked what the Americans with Disabilities Act means to him on its 20th anniversary, Gary Talbot pauses and says it's tough to put in words. Instead of directly answering the question, he begins to describe in vivid detail his journey from able-bodied man to able-bodied wheelchair user. A gifted auto mechanic, Talbot was driving home in his yellow '76 Honda CVCC Civic around 11 p.m. on Interstate 25 just north of Denver, Colorado, after a 14-hour shift. The lanky, freewheeling 24-year-old had just completed an overhaul of his Honda that night -- October 4, 1980 -- when, as Talbot put it, he ''literally took a nap behind the wheel.'' A few weeks earlier, Talbot said, a concrete hauler had hit the freeway median, taking out a big chunk of it. Instead of hitting the median, which might have woken him up in time, Talbot's Honda went straight through the open gap and into oncoming traffic. The collision flipped his car a few times and sent it skidding down the highway. Before police arrived, people rushed to the crash site to help while Talbot sat in the driver's seat of the now upside down car -- with its engine still running. ""I was all so proud of my work and to crunch it up on the first day, I was really pissed,'' Talbot said. When he turned off the engine, gas began pouring out of the carburetor. Talbot thought he was going to go up in flames. That was when he tried for the first time to push himself out -- and he realized he couldn't move. ""I thought, what the hell's going on, I must have slipped a disc or something and then I asked the guy to help me and he said he wouldn't'' because he was afraid of being sued. A few other men approached the wreckage and ''put a coat over my head so I wouldn't be able to identify anybody,'' Talbot said. Once at the hospital, Talbot remembers the doctor's good news-bad news speech: ""'You're going to live; you're never going to walk again,' '' Talbot recalled. Rebuilding his life . After the initial shock and physical pain started to ease, Talbot was relieved to be alive and thankful no one else was hurt in the accident. ""'I think I can make this work OK. I can still move my upper body. I'll still have good arm strength and shoulder strength. I can figure this thing out, and it won't be that bad of a deal,' '' Talbot recalls thinking. Within weeks, Talbot was fixing his doctor's car at the spinal cord hospital where he was being treated. The car wouldn't idle and the doctor challenged him to give it a try. Everyone in the hospital was in worse condition than Talbot, who said the doctor told him, ''You're going to learn how to get up off the floor and into your wheelchair by yourself and you're going to learn how to do wheelies and bounce up and down stairs.''' He tossed Talbot the keys to his MG and told him to get to work. When he was finally home again, Talbot had trouble finding a job as a mechanic, even though he proved he could do the work. ""They wouldn't let me fill out applications,'' he said. ""They would tell me there weren't cripples on staff and that their customers didn't want to see a guy in a wheelchair fixing a car."" So he opened his own auto shop, Gary's Honda Service. Six years later, he lost the business after becoming ill. Talbot then went back to school to earn his GED and then to the University of Michigan to study mechanical engineering. He also began learning about the need for accessibility for the disabled and landed a job with General Motors and later Disney -- helping both companies comply with ADA regulations. A new mission . In 2007, Talbot left Florida to join the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority as assistant general manager for systemwide accessibility.  As the new guy heading up the Boston transit system's efforts to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Talbot learned the hard way that he had a tough ride ahead. The ADA debate rages on, 20 years later . After he and his wife drove 30 hours to Boston and they dropped off their rental car, they decided to take the city bus. The bus pulled up in the middle of the road and, ""The driver looks right at me, lets three people off the second door in the back, looks at me, closes the door, slams the throttle and splits.'' ""It was just typical.'' In a class-action lawsuit in 2003, a group of riders sued the area's mass transit operator, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, because it was so inaccessible. According to Talbot, the elevators didn't work half the time, bus lifts were broken and drivers were not educated in dealing with the disabled. The next morning, the driver who'd left Talbot on the street found himself in Talbot's new office along with union representatives. Talbot said the driver was remorseful but gave the excuse that he was running late to get back to the terminal near the end of his shift. ""Boy, I tell you, I wanted to fire that guy so bad I could taste it.'' They agreed to a few days off without pay and two years of probation. The union and management urged Talbot to understand that drivers had not been trained yet. After all, his new job, they said, was to develop tools to turn around accessibility compliance at MBTA, which serves more than 1.3 million riders a day. And in building up the organization, that is exactly what Talbot did. Fast track to accessibility . Since he's been on board, he estimates MBTA has spent about $100 million on accessibility, putting it on what he calls a fast track to carry out projects that should have been done 15 years ago. Now 54, Talbot said his prime accomplishment has been revamping the procedures bus drivers follow to accommodate wheelchair users, the deaf and blind and people who use a cane, walker or crutches. He oversaw the creation of a step-by-step ''cookbook"" that teaches a driver ""how to win -- how to feel good about himself when someone with a disability gets on the bus.'' When Talbot started at MBTA three years ago, drivers pulled to the curb and lowered the bus -- or kneeled -- for disabled passengers about 25 percent of the time. That percentage figure is now in the mid-80s, Talbot said, but he won't be satisfied until it happens without fail. Under the rules, drivers who fail to kneel their buses for the disabled are disciplined, which wasn't the case in the past. MBTA went from ''the bottom of the barrel to industry leading'' in its accessibility for the disabled, Talbot said. Drivers underwent rigorous training that involved sitting in wheelchairs themselves and pushing their way up ramps and into buses. Many of the drivers couldn't even do it, Talbot said. With a staff of nine whose full-time job is to focus on accessibility, his department's budget is $1.5 million. Talbot also spearheaded a new accessibility design standard for future MBTA rail vehicles, meaning the system will tell manufacturers what to put in the car, rather than ""buying them off the rack."" The Americans with Disabilities Act doesn't just give disabled people physical access to buildings, restaurants and restrooms, Talbot said. It opens invisible doors and walls that would-be employers and others can put up when they see a disabled person. ""How can you think about being a participant and getting that full bite of the apple out of all our society has to offer if you're just taken and set aside and told 'You know, we don't have enough work.' You don't even get to fill out the application,"" Talbot said. ""That was pre-ADA.'' ''Now you have to look at the value of the individual and what the individual could potentially do rather than what your perception of the individual could do was.'' ADA: Too far or not far enough? While critics say the law, which President George H.W. Bush signed on July 26, 1990, can be burdensome, costly and an overextension of the government's  authority over the private sector, others say it could be stronger. For instance, Talbot says the ADA requires that at least one entrance on new buildings be accessible. ""What about the other two entrances? Why in the world would you segregate people with disabilities to only one entrance?"" Talbot also thinks faith helped him through his own life circumstances. ""I think I've made it. I have a great job. I wouldn't wish my injury on anybody and I don't like the fact that I can't walk down the street or go jogging or climb a hill or ride a bicycle.'' ''There's so much that I can do and I've been able to do that I just wouldn't change anything about my life.'' Talbot has been invited to celebrate the ADA's 20th anniversary with a visit to the White House on Monday. There he hopes to toast his 13th wedding anniversary with his wife, Pamela. ""I've been given a second chance, and I value that second chance every minute of every day.''","Paralyzed auto mechanic's life transformed by Americans with Disabilities Act .

"MANCHESTER, New Hampshire (CNN) -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and John McCain received much-needed boosts from New Hampshire Tuesday. Clinton, coming off a disappointing third-place finish in Iowa, rebounded to overcome rival Sen. Barack Obama in the state's Democratic primary. Supporters at her headquarters chanted ""comeback kid"" as the results came in. Clinton trailed Obama by 9 points in recent polls. On the Republican side, McCain easily won his party's primary. The results mark a resurgence for the Arizona senator, whose campaign was all but written off this summer.  What do the results mean? » .

""When the pundits declared us finished, I told them, 'I'm going to New Hampshire, where the voters don't let you make their decisions for them,' "" he said. "" 'I'm going to New Hampshire, and I'm going to tell people the truth.' "" Female voters and older voters helped hand Clinton the Democratic win, according to exit polls. In Iowa, Clinton lost out to Obama among women 35 percent to 30 percent. In New Hampshire, however, 45 percent of female Democratic primary voters picked Clinton, compared to 36 percent who went for Obama. Older voters also overwhelmingly outnumbered younger voters, a proportion that benefited Clinton. Sixty-seven percent of Democratic primary voters were over the age of 40, and they were breaking heavily for Clinton over Obama. McCain overcame former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney to seal the win in New Hampshire with 37 percent of the vote. Romney had led most polls in Iowa and New Hampshire before the votes there and held a 12-point lead in New Hampshire shortly before Christmas. He finished second, as he did in Iowa, five points behind McCain. Romney won Saturday's Wyoming caucus. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee -- winner of the Iowa caucuses -- finished third with 11 percent. Voters who supported McCain and those who supported Romney differed significantly on what issues they feel are most important, exit polling showed. Forty-six percent of those who supported McCain ranked the war in Iraq the most important. Meanwhile, voters who supported Romney overwhelmingly felt immigration was the most important issue. McCain has been a staunch supporter of the war in Iraq, but co-sponsored failed immigration reform legislation that drew the ire of many conservatives in his party. Romney has been taking a tough stance on immigration. McCain bested Huckabee, a one-time Baptist minister, among New Hampshire voters who said a candidate's religious beliefs matter a great deal, according to CNN exit polls. While Huckabee won overwhelmingly among those voters in Iowa, in New Hampshire, 35 percent went to McCain while 31 percent went to Huckabee. The religious voters made up 14 percent of all Republican primary voters in New Hampshire -- much less than in Iowa. Huckabee and Romney called McCain to congratulate him Tuesday night. ""I'll fight to be back in this state and others,"" Romney told supporters.  Watch Romney congratulate McCain » . Huckabee, who earlier said a third-place finish would be ""huge"" for him, also promised to return to New Hampshire. ""After we secure the nomination, we've got to come back here and make sure we carry New Hampshire."" Obama, the junior senator from Illinois, congratulated Clinton and praised ""all the candidates in this race"" as ""patriots who serve this country honorably."" But Obama assailed critics who he said doubted his campaign and said the record numbers of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire showed ""there is something happening in America."" ""For most of this campaign, we were far behind,"" he said. ""We always knew our climb would be steep. But in record numbers, you came out and you spoke up for change."" Former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina painted himself as the candidate of the voiceless after tracking a distant third in the Democratic primary. Noting that there are ""two states down, 48 states to go"" in primary and caucus voting, the 2004 vice presidential nominee said that only about 1 percent of Americans had voted so far and that the other ""99 percent deserve to be heard.""  Watch Edwards describe where he goes next » . With 95 percent of precincts counted, Clinton had 39 percent of the vote to Iowa caucus winner Obama's 37 percent. Edwards had 17 percent. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson had 5 percent, and Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich had 1 percent. With 95 percent of Republican precincts reporting, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani had 9 percent and Texas Rep. Ron Paul had 8 percent. Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson received 1 percent of the vote.  Watch Paul say he will continue to fight » . New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch predicted a record turnout for the first-in-the-nation presidential primary.

"Panama City (CNN) -- Former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega arrived Sunday evening in his home country, nearly 22 years after U.S. forces forcibly removed him from office. The 77-year-old was taken straight to El Renacer prison to serve time for crimes committed during his rule. Reporters flooded the medium-security facility in Gamboa, but the former leader was shielded from public view. Officials later confirmed that he was there. Earlier, Noriega arrived at the Tocumen International Airport in Panama City, where security was tight. ""I think it has historic and symbolic significance,"" said Michael Shifter, president of the Washington D.C.-based Inter-American Dialogue, about Noriega's return. ""It's a sense of closure for the Panamanian people. He clearly was a dictator for six years and presided over assassinations, disappearances and killing of opposition leaders. And so I think that it's something that was unfinished business and I think it's important for Panama to have a sense of closure,"" he said. Noriega's extradition process began Sunday morning with a flight from Paris to Madrid. He was in Spanish police custody during a four-hour layover before leaving Madrid Sunday afternoon on a flight to Panama City, a spokesman for Spain's airport authority said. Last month, a French court authorized his extradition to Panama, where officials want Noriega to face justice in the killings of Hugo Spadafora, his political opponent, and at least one other person. He was convicted in absentia. Speaking outside of the prison complex in Gamboa, Noriega's attorney said his client deserves fair representation. ""He (Noriega) wanted to return to the country and face in this land the charges for which he was tried in absentia,"" attorney Julio Berrios told reporters. ""General Noriega is accused of having participated in three homicides. U.S. President George H.W. Bush invaded us and that cost 4,000 deaths. Has anybody said anything against Bush?"" he said. Noriega has been in France since 2010, after two decades in an American prison. Authorities have strengthened security to guarantee his safety in Panama, according to Panamanian Foreign Minister Roberto Henriquez. ""We have to be ready for all the possibilities in all aspects. Noriega inspires very big emotions, and Noriega's life could very well be at risk in Panama,"" Henriquez said. Interior Minister Roxana Mendez said Noriega will receive the same treatment as other inmates in the Panamanian prison. ""The Panamanian state has no special consideration when it comes to him serving his sentence inside the prison complex,"" Mendez said. ""However, based on our laws, and if there's a valid request from his attorneys, they can ask that he be transferred from the prison to house arrest if the inmate's health is in jeopardy or if the inmate, being over 70 years old, may face risks inside the prison complex."" Last year, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for laundering 2.3 million euros ($2.9 million) through banks there. He was ordered to pay the money back. Noriega denied the charges. For almost two decades, Noriega was a major player in a country of critical regional importance to the United States because of its location on the Panama Canal, the key strategic and economic waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans on the narrow isthmus linking the Americas. Amid growing unrest in Panama, then-U.S. President Bush ordered the invasion of Panama in December 1989, saying Noriega's rule posed a threat to U.S. lives and property. Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. He surrendered in January 1990 and was quickly escorted to the United States for civilian trial. Noriega was indicted in the United States on charges of racketeering, laundering drug money and drug trafficking. He was accused of having links to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar's notorious Medellin cartel and, in the process, amassing a multimillion-dollar fortune. He was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes in the United States. While in U.S. custody, he suffered from prostate cancer and a stroke. The man who once loomed large in Panama, Noriega returned home a shadow of his former self. ""I don't think it's going to change in great measure the politics in Panama,"" said Shifter. ""The country has moved on. They're interested in different things. Many young people don't even know about the Noriega era. But I think for those who do remember I think it is important,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- When blogger Andrew Sullivan began urging readers to support his online venture, I could hear journalists everywhere slapping their foreheads and saying: . Hey, why don't I try that? Lots of luck. But all the chatter about whether Sullivan can get his followers to part with $19.99 a year to read his provocative posts on politics and life misses the larger point. He is doing what most journalists must do to survive in this digital age, and that is building a personal brand. Sure, few are as well known, as prolific and as possessed of sheer writing talent -- not to mention a taste for picking fights -- as Sullivan. But in ways that are starting to look inescapable, he is determined to turn his relationship with readers into cash flow. Watch: Does Oprah still have the cultural clout to save Lance Armstrong? First, the back story. Sullivan, a former editor of the New Republic, was blogging's first breakout star a dozen years ago, when the term was still associated with strange people in their pajamas. I followed him closely because I was, at the time, the first blogger at the The Washington Post. Sullivan has since taken his Dish site to Time, the Atlantic and, most recently, the Daily Beast, where I work. His decision to leave the Beast when his contract expired at the end of 2012 has drawn plenty of attention, especially since he says he has already raised $440,000 from his fans. Watch: Did Brent Musburger go too far in praising Alabama quarterback's girlfriend? ""We felt more and more that getting readers to pay a small amount for content was the only truly solid future for online journalism,"" Sullivan writes. He plans to use the money not only for himself but also to pay his small staff. As a British, Catholic, gay writer with HIV who has morphed from a conservative intellectual to an Obama-boosting intellectual, Sullivan crosses lots of lines and has an unusually passionate following. He isn't putting most of his content behind a pay wall, so he's essentially asking folks to pay up out of loyalty. And he doesn't plan to accept advertising. In a very real sense, though, most journalists these days are advertising themselves (and yours truly is no exception). When you see them on Twitter, posting thoughts and witticisms and links to their work, they are doing more than representing their employers in public. They are promoting themselves. When they pop up in cable news segments or on radio shows, sounding off about their stories, or just sounding off, they are promoting themselves. Watch: How mainstream media fell for Twitter hoax about Justin Bieber . We are seeing the rise of hybrid journalists, like Ezra Klein, who blogs for The Washington Post, is an MSNBC contributor and writes a column for Bloomberg News. Or Andrew Ross Sorkin, who writes a column for The New York Times, runs its DealBook blog and co-hosts CNBC's Squawk Box. But below the level of the brightest stars, there is a survival strategy at work. Newspapers and magazines are shrinking. I've lost count of the number of reporters, columnists and critics who have been laid off or taken buyouts, only to launch blogs, join websites, churn out e-books or otherwise seek a foothold in the digital economy. News organizations used to frown on this sort of thing; now they have bookers to get their folks on TV and social media editors to push their stars on Facebook and Twitter. The Times once discouraged its people from going on television; now, like most newspapers, it has its own studio. If there was once a line that stopped journalists from engaging in blatant self-promotion, it long ago vanished. But here's why that's not a bad thing. Most print journalists were once viewed as remote figures engaged in one-way communication. Now they've been forced to engage in a dialogue with their readers, responding to tweets, posting pictures, sharing more of themselves with those who consume the news. The walls of the fortress have been breached. ""There's nothing tawdry about offering your wares on the street. It's how magazines and newspapers started,"" Sullivan told The New York Times. Sullivan has been a trailblazer on this front. And while it's hard to imagine that many others could get people to pay for their scribblings, it was once unthinkable that millions would buy individual songs on iTunes or pay for online access to a newspaper.

"London (CNN) -- Probably the most boring question you can ask about religion is whether or not the whole thing is ""true."" Unfortunately, recent public discussions on religion have focused obsessively on precisely this issue, with a hardcore group of fanatical believers pitting themselves against an equally small band of fanatical atheists. I prefer a different tack. To my mind, of course, no part of religion is true in the sense of being God-given. It seems clear that there is no holy ghost, spirit, geist or divine emanation. The real issue is not whether God exists or not, but where one takes the argument to if one concludes he doesn't. I believe it must be possible to remain a committed atheist and nevertheless to find religions sporadically useful, interesting and consoling -- and be curious as to the possibilities of importing certain of their ideas and practices into the secular realm. One can be left cold by the doctrines of the Christian Trinity and the Buddhist Fivefold Path and yet at the same time be interested in the ways in which religions deliver sermons, promote morality, engender a spirit of community, make use of art and architecture, inspire travels, train minds and encourage gratitude at the beauty of spring. In a world beset by fundamentalists of believing and secular varieties, it must be possible to balance a rejection of religious faith with a selective reverence for religious rituals and concepts. TED.com: Karen Armstrong's wish for a charter of compassion . It is when we stop believing that religions have been handed down from above or else that they are entirely daft that matters become more interesting. We can then recognize that we invented religions to serve two central needs which continue to this day and which secular society has not been able to solve with any particular skill: firstly, the need to live together in communities in harmony, despite our deeply rooted selfish and violent impulses. And secondly, the need to cope with terrifying degrees of pain which arise from our vulnerability to professional failure, to troubled relationships, to the death of loved ones and to our decay and demise. God may be dead, but the urgent issues which impelled us to make him up still stir and demand resolutions which do not go away when we have been nudged to perceive some scientific inaccuracies in the tale of the seven loaves and fishes. The error of modern atheism has been to overlook how many sides of the faiths remain relevant even after their central tenets have been dismissed. Once we cease to feel that we must either prostrate ourselves before them or denigrate them, we are free to discover religions as a repository of occasionally ingenious concepts with which we can try to assuage a few of the most persistent and unattended ills of secular life. Secular society has been unfairly impoverished by the loss of an array of practices and themes which atheists typically find it impossible to live with. We have grown frightened of the word morality. We bridle at the thought of hearing a sermon. We flee from the idea that art should be uplifting or have an ethical mission. We don't go on pilgrimages. We can't build temples. We have no mechanisms for expressing gratitude. The notion of reading a self-help book has become absurd to the high-minded. We resist mental exercises. Strangers rarely sing together. We are presented with an unpleasant choice between either committing to peculiar concepts about immaterial deities or letting go entirely of a host of consoling, subtle or just charming rituals for which we struggle to find equivalents in secular society. TED.com: Jonathan Haidt on the moral roots of liberals and conservatives . Religions merit our attention for their sheer conceptual ambition; for changing the world in a way that few secular institutions ever have. They have managed to combine theories about ethics and metaphysics with practical involvement in education, fashion, politics, travel, hostelry, initiation ceremonies, publishing, art and architecture -- a range of interests which puts to shame the scope of the achievements of even the greatest and most influential secular movements and individuals in history. For those interested in the spread and impact of ideas, it is hard not to be mesmerized by examples of the most successful educational and intellectual movements the planet has ever witnessed. There are sides of religions that are timely and consoling even for skeptical contemporary minds. Atheists can learn to rescue some of what is beautiful, touching and wise from all that no longer seems true. The wisdom of the faiths belongs to all of mankind, even the most rational among us, and deserves to be selectively reabsorbed by the supernatural's greatest enemies. Religions are intermittently too useful, effective and intelligent to be abandoned to the religious alone. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- A California bounty hunter says he will sue Casey Anthony and her defense attorney Jose Baez for misleading him when he helped search for her young daughter Caylee. Leonard Padilla said he is seeking $200,000. Padilla said Anthony's attorney allowed him to fly to Florida in 2008 and help search for Anthony's then-missing 2-year-old daughter. Anthony left jail Sunday after being acquitted of murder charges in connection with the death of her daughter. Padilla says when he heard Baez's opening statement during Anthony's murder trial he felt conned. ""It turns out she knew where the child was all along,"" Padilla said. ""They misled me, and it is definitely fraud."" At one point during the highly-publicized search for Caylee, Padilla offered a $25,000 reward for the girl's return. He also says he spent $50,000 to bond out Anthony when she was initially jailed. He said he also brought in people to help provide security. He said he talked to Anthony on many occasions during that time and that she never said she knew where Caylee was. ""She told me the babysitter stole the baby,"" Padilla said. ""They were both feeding us that line. And now we know it was never true. We lost a lot of money."" Padilla says it may take a few weeks to get his lawsuit together. Johnny Griffin, a California legal expert, told CNN affiliate KCRA that Padilla's lawsuit may have legal merit. But he may need to do some work to prove his case, Griffin said. ""Casey Anthony never testified at trial. So he needs to prove that she lied to him,"" Griffin told the affiliate. Baez can also claim that Padilla made more money becoming part of the Casey Anthony story than it cost him to be part of the search, Griffin said. When the lawsuit is filed, Padilla may have to get in line behind the others seeking money from Anthony. Florida officials are asking that Anthony repay the state for the enormous cost of investigating the case. In a motion filed earlier this month, the state called for a hearing so it can tally up costs and slap Anthony with the bill. ""The efforts and costs of the investigation were extensive and not immediately available and accordingly, the State of Florida respectfully requests this Court to set a hearing within 60 days to determine total costs,"" the motion says. The motion cites a Florida law that allows the state to fine defendants in criminal cases to recoup money spent. Texas EquuSearch, a firm that helped search for Anthony's daughter, also wants its money back. The company said it used 4,200 searchers and spent $112,000 looking for Caylee in Florida after the girl was reported missing in July 2008. Tim Miller, the head of company, has said he is suing because he believes Caylee never was missing. Anthony also faces a lawsuit from a woman named Zenaida Gonzalez. At the time of Caylee's disappearance, Anthony told family members and police that the little girl was with a nanny named Zenaida Fernandez Gonzalez. That account resulted in one of Anthony's lying convictions. Anthony also claimed Gonzalez had kidnapped the toddler. Authorities never found a nanny by that name who cared for Caylee. They did, however, find a woman named Zenaida Fernandez Gonzalez, who denied ever meeting Anthony. Gonzalez then filed the defamation lawsuit. The judge handling the defamation lawsuit set Anthony's deposition for October 8. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report. Watch Nancy Grace Monday through Sunday starting at 8 p.m. ET on HLN.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama called Monday for Congress to pass education reforms by the time students return to school next fall, telling a Virginia middle school that fixing problems in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act -- more commonly known as ""No Child Left Behind"" -- should be a top priority. ""In the 21st century, it's not enough to leave no child behind. We need to help every child get ahead,"" Obama said, urging Congress ""to send me an education reform bill I can sign into law before the next school year begins."" Mindful of the budget debate currently enveloping Washington, Obama insisted that education funding must remain robust because it is vital to the nation's future success. ""We cannot cut education,"" Obama said, noting that families facing tough times cut back on vacation or movies or eating out, rather than dipping into savings for a child's college tuition. ""A budget that sacrifices our children's education will be a budget that sacrifices our country's future,"" he said. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act was originally passed in 1965 and requires periodic reauthorization. The current version of the law, which was passed on a bipartisan basis in 2002, requires states to set higher standards and to have greater accountability through standardized testing. Education Secretary Arne Duncan issued a dire prediction Sunday afternoon during a conference call with reporters, saying that if ""No Child Left Behind"" isn't reformed, four out of five schools won't meet the law's standards. ""Under the current law, it's one size fits all,"" Duncan said. ""We need to fix this law now so we can close the achievement gap."" The administration, which has been meeting with congressional leaders to hash out changes before any reauthorization vote, believes current law is too punitive and has led to a too-narrow curriculum and lower standards. A pair of House Republicans agree. ""Although we have our different approaches, everyone agrees the current law is broken and in need of repair. The status quo is failing both students and taxpayers,"" Reps. John Kline, R-Minnesota, and Duncan Hunter, R-California, said in a joint statement last week. ""No one disagrees on the importance of education,"" Duncan said Sunday. ""For the most part, we've been largely aligned with leaders on both sides of the aisle, but we need to come together and do the right thing for our children."" For Obama, that means increasing the incentive-based concept of his ""Race to the Top"" program that offers extra funding for states that show home-grown education reforms are improving performance. He proposed expanding ""Race to the Top"" to let local school districts apply, and said reforming ""No Child Left Behind"" should build on the program's goals. The president made a point of promoting the importance of teachers, calling for them to get more pay and respect as valued assets in the nation's future success. He made no mention of the new Wisconsin law that stripped some collective bargaining benefits from teachers and other public employees, but his enthusiastic promotion of teachers prompted applause and cheers of support. Obama spoke at Kenmore Middle School in Arlington, Virginia. The arts and communications magnet school has incorporated technology in many areas of its curriculum.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Bullying Prevention Thursday. ""If there is one goal of this conference, it is to dispel the myth that bullying is just a harmless rite of passage or an inevitable part of growing up,"" Obama said in a speech at the conference. He added that there were times in his childhood where he himself was bullied. ""I have to say, with big ears and the name that I had, I was not immune. I didn't emerge unscathed,"" he said. An anti-bullying PSA released online in January declares that more than six-million schoolchildren experienced bullying in the past six months. As parents of two teenage girls, the issue resonates with the president and first lady. ""I spend a lot of time talking to them about putting themselves in other people's shoes and seeing through other people's eyes,"" Obama said at a town hall, hosted by BET and MTV, in October 2010. ""And if somebody is different from you, that's not something you criticize, that's something that you appreciate."" His comments came just weeks after a string of highly publicized suicide cases where boys as young as 13 killed themselves as a result of alleged bullying and harassment at school and over the Internet. The suicides last fall had one thing in common, homosexuality, which catalyzed thousands of people to tape video messages -- including President Obama, celebrities, politicians -- for the ""It Gets Better Project"" to inspire and encourage LGBT youth who are struggling. ""I don't know what it's like to be picked on for being gay, but I do know what it's like to grow up feeling that sometimes you don't belong,"" Obama said in his video message released in October 2010 that became the second most viewed clip on the White House YouTube channel that year. The conference, put on in coordination with the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services, includes discussions about the effects of bullying on young people, preventing bullying and harassment in schools and the community, and cyberbullying. President Obama and the first lady met with students and parents from the Conference on Bullying Prevention in the Oval Office on Thursday, prior to delivering remarks in the East Room. At midday, there will be a Facebook video chat about internet safety. Kalpen Modi, associate director for the White House Office of Public Engagement, will moderate the discussion with Facebook Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan, MTV Vice President of Public Affairs Jason Rzepka and author Rosalind Wiseman, who writes about teens, parenting and bullying. There will also be an iVillage video chat with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Sebelius, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, and Domestic Policy Council Director Melody Barnes will conclude the conference with closing remarks. The Department of Education hosted the first-ever National Bullying Summit in August 2010, and a websit, StopBullying.gov has been created. In the administration's 2012 fiscal budget, Obama has designated $132 million to combat violence and the bullying of children, providing grants to state and local governments under the Education department's ""Successful, Safe, and Healthy Students"" program. Anti-bullying legislation, called the Safe Schools Improvement Act, was introduced this week by Democratic Sen. Bob Casey from Pennsylvania and Republican Sen. Mark Kirk from Illinois. The bipartisan legislation would require schools and districts receiving designated federal funds to adopt codes of conduct specifically prohibiting bullying and harassment. The act would ensure that schools and districts implement effective prevention programs, and would require states to report data on bullying and harassment to the Department of Education.","NEW: Obama recalls being bullied .

"(CNN) -- Even without the looming threat of civil war in Syria, flirting with a Middle Eastern ruler is dangerous business. Not that the practice of extramarital affairs and illicit rendezvous is uncommon: Brutal autocrats from former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to erratic Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and their sons were rumored to have sexual encounters with numerous women during their reigns. A trove of recently leaked e-mails purportedly from embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's inbox appear to indicate several women brazenly flirting with the father of three, some while working for the regime. Chief among the women is U.S.-educated Hadeel al-Ali, who in one e-mail sent a photograph allegedly of herself in a skimpy bra and thong, with her derriÃ¨re facing the camera. In the cache of nearly 3,000 e-mails obtained by CNN, it does not appear al-Assad reciprocates her advances. Nonetheless, in one message the young woman features a photo of a young Bashar and the lines ""so cute, I miss youuuuuuu."" Just two days after the U.N. published a damning report alleging that government forces committed crimes against humanity and killed more than 250 children, al-Ali wrote, ""let the world see that we all are your shabeeha even the tiny little generation believes in you and is ready to fight from now."" The shabeeha are pro-regime militias or thugs accused of the worst atrocities and killings by the opposition. Syrian forces pound Homs neighborhood . On occasion, the schoolgirl crush takes a more serious tone as the 20-something political science graduate appears to relay public relations advice from Tehran. More than five pages of suggestions for the president include advice to use language like Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary-general of Hezbollah, and attack Israel as ""the real enemy."" In New York, Sheherazad Jaafari, daughter of Syrian Ambassador to the U.N. Bashar Jaafari, provided advice on al-Assad's public image abroad while occasionally sending overtly sexual notes calling the ruler ""handsome"" and ""cute."" As regime forces shelled the flashpoint city of Homs in late January, Jaafari appears to plead for a meeting with the president: ""I am coming today. I will arrive there tomorrow. and i wanna see after tomorrow. I CANT wait. no excuses :D... miss uuu please please please."" Clinton urges al-Assad to heed Arab League . Among the few e-mail responses sent by al-Assad, it appears the isolated ruler is more preoccupied flirting with his British-born wife, Asma, than responding to adulation from other women. ""If we are strong together, we will overcome this together ... I love you ..."" al-Assad wrote his wife the day the Arab League suspended its monitoring mission in Syria because of a spike in violence. Days later, the 46-year-old ophthalmologist-turned-autocrat doodled an elaborate sketch of a large pink and red heart on an iPad and e-mailed it to his first lady. Asma, who boasts in one e-mail to a friend that she is the ""REAL dictator"" in her relationship, reciprocates the affection, once writing her husband a short poem. ""Sometimes at night, when I look to the sky, I start thinking of you and ask myself, why? Why do I love you? I think and smile, because I know the list could run on for miles."" As the president's inbox filled with schoolyard flirtation and adoration, the regime continued a bloody campaign that the opposition says has decimated entire towns and claimed thousands of lives.","Leaked messages reveal women's affection for Syrian president .

"(CNN) -- The operation that led to the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden took shape after detainees identified a trusted bin Laden courier as someone who may have been living with and protecting the militant leader, senior administration officials said. That courier became a key lead in locating bin Laden, the officials said. The officials provided details on the origins of the operation and the raid that led to bin Laden's killing: . • Four years ago: Officials uncovered the courier's identity. • Two years ago: Investigators identified areas of Pakistan where the courier and his brother lived. • August: The residence of the courier and his brother was found in Abbottabad, 30 to 35 miles north of Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. • September: The CIA worked with President Barack Obama ""on a set of assessments that led it to believe that in fact it was possible"" bin Laden may be at the compound in Abbottabad. • February: U.S. officials concluded there was a ""sound intelligence basis"" for pursuing bin Laden at that location. • March and April. Obama held a series of National Security Council meetings ""to develop courses of action to bring justice to Osama bin Laden.""

The senior administration officials provided these details of the raid: . • The team was in the compound for 40 minutes.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was quick to suggest that the death of Osama bin Laden offered a unique opportunity for a wider settlement in a region riven by warfare and insurgency. ""Our message to the Taliban remains the same,"" she said Monday. ""You cannot wait us out, you cannot defeat us, but you can make the choice to abandon al Qaeda and participate in a peaceful political process."" That has been a long-cherished ambition of U.S. foreign policy -- to delink the ""good"" Taliban from the ""bad"" Taliban and al Qaeda as a way of bringing peace to Afghanistan. As Clinton put in a speech to the Asia Society in February, the Holy Grail was to ""split the weakened Taliban off from al Qaeda and reconcile those who will renounce violence and accept the Afghan constitution."" Achieving that goal has become all the more urgent with the looming deadline to begin the withdrawal of U.S. and coalition forces from Afghanistan, and President Obama's goal to complete that withdrawal in 2014. Former British Foreign Secretary David Miliband has argued that the West had effectively announced the date of the end of the war; and that was an invitation to the insurgents to bide their time. Now -- ""post OBL"" - the omens may be more encouraging. The secretary of state apparently thinks so. Events across the Middle East, she said Monday, are changing the political landscape. Muslims are ""rejecting extremist narratives and charting a path of peaceful progress based on universal rights and aspirations,"" she said. A deathblow to al Qaeda? And there is polling to suggest that the appeal of al Qaeda's message among Muslims around the world has sharply eroded, according to regular polling by the Pew Research Center. Even in Pakistan, only 18 percent had confidence in bin Laden in 2010, compared to 52 percent in 2005. Jihadist online forums were full of hand-wringing in January and February that the uprisings in the Middle East had passed them by, while offering a variety of strategies for co-opting or taking advantage of the unrest. Beyond this cultural shift, there are other reasons the Taliban/al Qaeda linkage may now be weaker. Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid, author of ""The Taliban"" and ""Descent into Chaos"" wrote in the Financial Times Monday that ""the Taliban do not owe al Qaeda anything now that Osama bin Laden is dead."" No obvious replacement to succeed bin Laden . ""Renouncing their links with al Qaeda and negotiating as Afghans rather than as members of an international jihad has just become much easier for the Taliban,"" he added. The Afghan Taliban, a home-grown movement whose principal goal is to expel foreigners, has never had that much in common philosophically with the Arab jihadists bent on using Afghanistan as the starting point in building a worldwide Caliphate. They have no record of terrorist acts beyond Afghanistan's borders. To many observers, it was a marriage of convenience. There may also be more prosaic reasons prodding the Taliban to distance themselves from the al Qaeda leadership. If the U.S. Navy Seals did indeed come across what CNN Terrorism Analyst Peter Bergen described as a ""boatload"" of evidence during the raid in Abbottabad, some of it may (just may) help in tracking down members of the Quetta leadership of the Taliban. However, analysts say it's by no means certain that the Taliban will perceive this watershed in the way that Clinton would wish. The day before the operation that killed bin Laden, they declared the beginning of their spring offensive. They even made a point of warning that members of the Afghan Peace Council, established with great fanfare last year by President Hamid Karzai, would be targets. And they reiterated their central demand: ""The war in our country will not come to an end unless and until the foreign invading forces pull out of Afghanistan."" How U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden . The Taliban have been weakened in critical areas in the south of Afghanistan, losing strongholds in Kandahar and Helmand provinces and seeing scores of rank-and-file fighters give up the cause. But the fight in the east is as hard as ever -- and non-governmental organizations in Kabul have also spoken of a growing Taliban presence in the north. U.S. commanders acknowledge that gains made so far have been fragile -- and are reversible. A Pentagon report published last week said that expanding the Afghan government's influence and control outside Kabul had not kept pace with recent security gains. So there are few signs that the Taliban -- even if they are tired of fighting -- can yet be strong-armed into suing for peace. In a report for the New America Foundation last year, Anand Gopal argued that the Taliban have been able to exploit the ineptitude of the government in Kabul. ""They were able to take advantage of growing disillusionment in the countryside,"" he wrote. ""In particular, the dominance of one particular set of tribes caused members of other, marginalized tribes to look to the insurgency as a source of protection and access to resources."" The late Richard Holbrooke, who was the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, acknowledged that victory on the battlefield was not on the horizon, telling CNN's Fareed Zakaria last October that ""some kind of political element to this is essential, and we are looking at every aspect of this."" Holbrooke also made the point that the Taliban did not have a single address, a principal interlocutor like Slobodan Milosevic or the Palestinian Authority. ""There is a widely dispersed group of people that we roughly call the enemy,"" he said. Referring to the diffuse nature of the Taliban, Miliband argues the West needs to reappraise its goals in Afghanistan. He described Afghanistan as ""a country of 40,000 villages and valleys,"" where a political settlement needs to be ""internal with all the tribes and regional with the neighbors."" That means a political role for the Taliban. ""We have to be absolutely clear, I think, that we do see a place for conservative Pashtun in the political settlement, helping govern the south and east of the country,"" Miliband told the Council on Foreign Relations recently. Some of the previous contacts between the Taliban leadership and the government in Kabul have been managed by Saudi Arabia. In September 2008, an eleven-member Taliban delegation went to Mecca for talks mediated by King Abdullah. CNN's Nic Robertson reported at the time that the delegation was keen to stress that Mullah Omar, the Taliban's spiritual leader, was no longer allied to al Qaeda. But vigorous Saudi involvement might be problematic now given the Kingdom's focus on its ""near abroad:"" the chaos in Yemen and conflict in Bahrain, where Saudi troops are now stationed. Add to that the deterioration in the Kingdom's relations with Washington over the ""Arab spring"" and what the Saudis regard as a reckless abandonment by the Obama administration of long-time allies like former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Another complicating factor: Saudi Arabia is also looking to improve its relationship with Pakistan as a regional counterweight to Iranian expansionism, and Pakistan (which supported the Taliban when it ruled Afghanistan) very much wants a place at the table in any negotiation on Afghanistan's future. In the ""plus"" column, the initiative by Turkey -- an increasingly assertive regional player -- to allow the Taliban to open an office there, to help accelerate the peace process. But for now it's just an initiative, not a reality. So while bin Laden's demise brings opportunities, there are also great obstacles in making it the first downpayment of a peace dividend. Clinton acknowledged as much when she said Monday: ""Which way it breaks is not clear yet,"" she said. ""Managing these reactions will be part of our challenge.""","Clinton sees death of Osama bin Laden as a potential avenue to peace .

"GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (CNN) -- When Guatemalan laborer Faustino Morales fell from a scaffold in February, the response from volunteer firefighters was immediate. Within minutes, the ""bomberos"" reached the accident site with advanced rescue equipment, an ambulance and a thorough knowledge of how to treat his injuries. Paul Embleton's BRAVE Foundation has trained more than 1,000 volunteer firefighters in Guatemala. Just 10 years ago, help would more likely have come from under-trained volunteers who arrived in a pickup truck. Veteran firefighter Paul Embleton witnessed such a rescue attempt in 1996 while on a medical mission trip to Guatemala -- and it moved him into action. ""I rode out with a busy company that ran multiple calls a day, mostly involving crashes, shootings, stabbings ... a lot of violence,"" said Embleton, 48. ""They didn't have ambulances. [Firefighters] would respond to these calls, grab the patients from the streets and throw them in the back of the pickup truck. They just transported; they didn't provide a whole lot of care."" He saw several people die in those pickup trucks. Knowing they could have had a better chance of survival with basic pre-hospital care, Embleton, a captain paramedic firefighter from Washington state, saw an opportunity to help. Embleton launched the BRAVE Foundation -- Bomberos Resourceful And Valiant Efforts -- to provide emergency response training and equipment to volunteer firefighters (bomberos) in Guatemala. Do you know someone who should be a CNN Hero? Nominations are open at CNN.com/Heroes . During his first trip there, he openly criticized the firefighters' lack of resources and training. The firefighters, in turn, asked him to hold a class for them. ""I'd gone back to my hotel to try to think how I was going to teach with the same limited resources they had,"" Embleton said. ""I cut up my hotel bed sheets and made triangular bandages, and got cardboard boxes to utilize for splints."" With the help of a 12-year-old interpreter, Embleton taught roughly 100 students techniques in basic bleeding control. David Alvarez, the chief of 10 Fire Station in Guatemala, was among Embleton's first students. ""It was really primitive before,"" Alvarez said. ""Basic techniques that firefighters had outside of Guatemala, we'd never learned, and we wanted to learn."" In 1998, with assistance from fellow Washington firefighters and Rotary International, the BRAVE Foundation established a pilot emergency medical training program in Guatemala City, using the U.S. emergency medical technician curriculum translated into Spanish. Since then, the EMT training program has expanded to 14 training programs throughout the country.  Watch Embleton describe what made him take action in Guatemala » . ""Things have improved drastically since our program began,"" said Embleton. ""The skill level of the firefighters has increased immensely. They have more confidence and more respect from hospitals in providing pre-hospital care, and the citizens have noticed this."" In 2007, just a few years shy of retirement, Embleton was granted a leave of absence from his work as a Washington firefighter. He sold a private Internet-based business and relocated to Guatemala to volunteer full-time. His group is building a fire station and training firefighters at 120 Company -- the newest company of firefighters in the remote lake community of San Juan La Laguna. ""We've moved out to the country to support an indigenous Mayan community where the needs are great,"" Embleton said. ""They've never had anybody to call because there was nobody available to respond. We're educating the people that the firefighters are here to help.""  Watch how Embleton and volunteers provide rescue services to a remote community » . To date, Embleton's BRAVE Foundation has organized the delivery of 20 firefighting vehicles and more than $1 million worth of medical and rescue equipment. The group has provided EMT training to more than 1,000 firefighters. ""The firefighters have the motivation, and you get a heart for it because you see how well we have it in the States,"" Embleton said. ""These guys are so poor and they try so hard, and they have no other resources to make a program like this work on their own.""  Watch a day in the life of a firefighter in Guatemala » . Despite his personal sacrifice, Embleton is quick to share credit for BRAVE's efforts and success, citing the help of volunteers, private donors, firefighters, Rotary and the Guatemala community. ""You see all the good that it does,"" said Embleton. ""People call the firefighters when they're in trouble, and they know that the firemen will always be there."" Want to get involved?

"Washington (CNN) -- The members of the legal team representing presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. say they are owed ""significant legal bills in arrears"" and are asking a judge's permission to bow out of Hinckley's case. In a motion filed Friday, defense lawyer Barry Levine says he and other lawyers at Dickstein Shapiro LLP have represented Hinckley at numerous hearings through the years at reduced rates. According to the document, Hinckley's family has told the legal firm ""it will not provide future funding for attorneys' fees, expenses or related experts in this matter."" The motion does not say how much the firm is still owed. The legal team represented Hinckley during 13 days of testimony in late 2011 and early 2012 on a St. Elizabeths Hospital proposal to allow Hinckley to have longer visits to his mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia. The motion filed by the lawyers Friday said Judge Paul Friedman has told counsel he will not rule on the plan proposed by Hinckley's mental hospital until November. On August 17, prosecutors on the Hinckley case filed a motion asking Friedman to reject the proposal for more visitation time because a key part of the plan had fallen through. According to the government court filing, St. Elizabeths sent an August 8 letter stating that Colonial Behavioral Health, People's Place facility in Williamsburg had withdrawn from the plan to participate in Hinckley's treatment by providing him access to group social sessions. The letter has not been made public, and prosecutors did not reveal why People's Place had bowed out. Prosecutors called the group sessions a ""core feature"" of the plan to allow Hinckley, 57, to spend more time living with his elderly mother in Williamsburg. In their motion to withdraw from his case, Hinckley's lawyers say that their departure will not harm the case and that he can obtain other representation. Hinckley spends 10 days a month visiting his widowed mother, who is in her late 80s. In July 2011, St. Elizabeths proposed allowing Hinckley two 17-day visits followed by six stays lasting 24 days. After the proposed visits, St. Elizabeths requested the authority to decide whether Hinckley, 57, could be released on ""convalescent leave,"" which would make him a permanent outpatient. Hinckley's mother, Jo Ann, attended parts of the hearing on the hospital's visitation plan. His brother and sister both testified during sessions. Levine, the defense lawyer, made several references during the hearing to the family possessing diminishing resources. Hinckley's father is deceased. Hinckley sat quietly during the multiple days of testimony but never testified. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shooting of President Ronald Reagan, press secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and police officer Thomas Delahanty. Brady was shot in the head and permanently disabled. Hinckley's delusions about actress Jodie Foster motivated him to shoot Reagan.","Team says it's owed ""significant legal bills in arrears""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- High school boys in a California town overlooking San Francisco Bay started a ""Fantasy Slut League"" targeting girls, school officials said Tuesday. Piedmont High School Principal Rich Kitchens said in a letter to parents last week that boys organized ""a 'Fantasy Slut League' in which our female students (unbeknownst to most of them) are drafted as part of the league,"" according to CNN affiliate KGO. ""Male students earn points for documented engagement in sexual activities with female students,"" the principal wrote, according to KGO. ""Participation often involved pressure/manipulation by older students that included alcohol to impair judgment/control and social demands to be popular."" Opinion: Talk to your kids about sex . Kitchens, who said the school is investigating the accusations, couldn't be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. Piedmont Unified School District Superintendent Constance Hubbard's office declined to release a copy of the principal's letter. But the superintendent is encouraging educators, parents and their teenagers to discuss how ""to make good choices and to treat each other with respect and dignity,"" she said in a statement Tuesday. ""We wanted to communicate to families to encourage a dialogue and to inform parents of what we as a school community are doing to proactively address activities that are detrimental to the culture we want for our students,"" Hubbard said. Piedmont, an affluent community of 11,000 residents, sits in Oakland Hills overlooking the bay. The tight-knit city consists of ""established, high-quality homes on quiet tree-lined streets,"" according to the city's website. The principal's letter said school staff members learned of the boys' activity during a recent assembly about date rape prevention, KGO reported.

"(CNN) -- The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has dropped honor-court proceedings against a student who said the school retaliated against her for a sexual assault allegation. In an e-mail to faculty and students on Thursday, Chancellor Holden Thorp said an outside review indicated no evidence of retaliation against Landen Gambill, who accused her ex-boyfriend of rape. Gambill is one of several students who sparked a Department of Education investigation into how the university handles sex assault cases. Thorp said a section of the honor code pertaining to ""disruptive or intimidating behavior"" would be suspended pending further review. ""This action is not a challenge to the important role of students in our Honor System, but is intended to protect the free speech rights of our students,"" the chancellor said in his e-mail. Thorp said the ""important issue"" will receive further discussion. Gambill's attorney, Henry Clay Turner, had written a letter to Thorp, saying his client believed the university was retaliating against her because it let the student-run honor court charge her with intimidating her former boyfriend. Gambill did not file a sexual assault report with police, and her former boyfriend -- who has not been identified publicly -- denied her accusation, according to his attorney. The man then asked the honor court to consider intimidation charges against Gambill, saying her accusations had negatively changed perceptions of him on campus. According to news reports, a campus judicial proceeding found him not guilty of sexual misconduct in 2012. The Education Department in March opened its investigation at the request of current and former students as well as a former administrator. The department is looking into the women's allegations that school administrators brushed aside concerns about sexual violence on campus and failed to adequately investigate complaints of sexual assault. In an interview in March, Thorp told CNN that university policies follow federal law and that the school has worked to make sure everyone there knows how a sexual assault allegation will be handled -- ""but the way we implement (policies) can always continue to be improved."" School administrators have disputed the cavalier attitude toward sexual assault alleged by the students, noting that UNC has removed sexual violence cases from the list of concerns handled by the school's honor court and appointed an administrator to deal directly with victims. The university created a 22-member task force to review and enhance its procedures for handling student-on-student complaints of harassment, sexual misconduct or discrimination. CNN's attempts Friday to reach Turner were not immediately successful. His law firm, in a tweet Thursday, said the charges against Gambill were ""unconstitutional.""

"Grass Valley, California (CNN) -- In the foothills of California's Sierra Nevada mountains, artists are partnering with doctors and scientists to create life-changing products. In a small strip of commercial buildings in this town northeast of Sacramento, you'll find Farlow's Scientific Glassblowing. The modest lobby opens up into a pristine production lab filled with skilled glassblowers, blue-flaming torches and dazzling glass models of the human heart, brain and vascular system. ""It's science, and it's art,"" said Wade Martindale, Farlow's production manager. Farlow's Scientific Glassblowing makes the glass organs and vascular models used by medical-device manufacturers in preliminary testing to determine whether their products will work in real-life situations. For example, a medical company could request a glass model be built to spec for testing a new heart-valve catheter. Farlow's glassblowing team would then create a heart connected to a vascular system connected to a custom opening in the femoral artery of the leg. The company then uses that model for research and development to test catheter deployment. ""A lot of these models are FDA approved for these companies so that they can use it as a true proving ground to get to the next level of testing,"" Martindale told CNN. When CNN visited the shop, Martindale was working on one of his more remarkable pieces -- what he calls a ""demonstrator heart model."" He uses CT scans, medical illustrations and even casts taken from cadavers to create an anatomically precise model of the human heart. Each component of the model is made by hand to customer specifications. ""Sometimes doctors want an aneurysm in them, sometimes they want diseased hearts,"" Martindale said as he spun molten glass. ""So each one is unique."" The glass hearts also have educational value. Cardiologists can connect the models to a water pump to simulate blood flow. And medical students use the glass tubes to practice catheter or stent placement. Although demand from the science and medical industry can fluctuate, Martindale says Farlow's Scientific Glassblowing has shown steady growth. ""We ship all over the world from Japan to Europe to India,"" he says, ""so we have been able to expand into global (markets) instead of regional."" The now-international company has humble roots. Gary Farlow, the company's founder, started glassblowing more than 30 years ago in the San Francisco Bay area. Like many artists, he started out making simple glass toys and figurines to sell at malls. Farlow quickly realized there wasn't a lot of money to be made in glass art, so he focused on scientific glassware. ""Gary always had grand ideas, he was always one to push the envelope,"" says Martindale, who is Farlow's nephew. ""He was never satisfied with small."" Farlow passed away last year, but his legacy as an artist and entrepreneur lives on. It was after he took a more business-like approach to glassblowing that he caught a big break. A medical manufacturer asked him to make angioplasty balloon molds out of glass. Farlow's Scientific Glassblowing was born. ""The 'a-ha' moment was when he found out that he could turn a metal part that was made in the medical industry into glass and he could produce it for way cheaper than anyone else,"" Martindale said. Prices for Farlow's glass organs today start at several hundred dollars. In 1994, Farlow moved the blossoming business from the Bay area to Grass Valley, where then 13-year-old Martindale started an apprenticeship. ""After doing four summers with him, I said, 'This is what I love to do. This is a great medium to work in,' "" he said. Later, after graduating college, Martindale joined the company full time. He likes that the work combines creativity with helping advance the state of medical research. ""It's art, it's handcrafted and it's used for something that could potentially save someone's life,"" he said with a smile, ""It makes me feel good that I'm involved in helping people."" Before CNN arrived at the shop, the glassblowing team assembled a full-scale human model named ""Mrs. Einstein,"" or ""Mrs. E"" for short. The model began with just one piece, the center of the brain. Then the team built out the rest of the brain and added a heart, veins, lungs and vascular components for the arms and legs -- all created by glassblowing. ""This is the collaboration of all the years of making different models and taking all that knowledge and putting it into one cohesive piece of glass,"" said Martindale. Yes, pieces of Mrs. E have been broken. And if you're thinking of buying a full-body glass model like Mrs. E for yourself, be prepared to spend around $25,000.","A glassblowing shop makes organs used by doctors and medical-device manufacturers .

"Mount Kisco, New York (CNN) -- Three nurses saw it this way -- it was a gut reaction that led to a kick in the guts. The suburban New York maternity ward nurses testified Tuesday they were simply trying to protect Douglas Kennedy's infant, whose head was bobbing as his father tried to take him outside the hospital, allegedly without permission. That's when Kennedy kicked one of them and twisted the arm of another, they testified. It was the second day of Kennedy's criminal trial on misdemeanor charges of harassment and child endangerment resulting from what happened in January at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, about 40 miles north of New York City. One of the nurses, Cari Luciano, said that as Kennedy tried to get past the nurses and into the stairwell, his infant's head was being jostled, unsupported, in his arms. She testified that she instinctively reached out to steady it when Kennedy kicked her squarely in the pelvis. Kennedy lawyer says nurses should be disciplined . Nurse Marian Williams said she saw Kennedy kick Luciano with ""such force"" that it knocked her off her feet. The third nurse, Anna Lane, testified Kennedy twisted her arm off the stairwell door as he tried to leave. ""The baby was bouncing around in Mr. Kennedy's arms,"" she testified, explaining why the three nurses tried to intervene. Prosecutors say the nurses were simply following hospital protocol set up in newborns' interests when they tried to keep infant Bo from being taken out of the hospital. Not only did Kennedy not back down, prosecutors say, but he fought back. Kennedy removed the baby's electronic security bracelet and laid it on the counter before he headed for the elevators, prosecutors say. The nurses were trying to enforce hospital rules when they stopped him from using the elevators, and that's when he headed for the stairs, they say. Once he kicked the nurse, Kennedy only got as far as the next landing when hospital security stopped him, Lane testified Monday. Defense lawyer Celia Gordon suggested Monday that Kennedy was calm during the situation, and that things only deteriorated because of Lane. It was Kennedy's instinct, not Lane's, to protect his baby from being ripped from his arms, she said in her opening statement. Kennedy's attorney has previously said the nurses initially agreed to let Kennedy take the baby outside. But their attorney, Elliot Taub, has said neither Lane nor Luciano recognized Kennedy as the child's father. Williams, who witnessed the alleged assault, said she couldn't understand why Kennedy would want to take his newborn outside for ""fresh air"" at 7 or 7:30 in the evening. ""I didn't understand why he tried to do it,"" she testified. There is a host of procedures before a baby can be discharged, Lane said. A supervisor needs to approve it, forms need to be signed and family members, including the infant's mother, need to agree. None of the procedures was followed, she said. Lane testified she asked Kennedy to identify his baby, Bo, by his hospital bracelet, and to go back to his mother so she could match the names. She said she asked him to put Bo in a bassinet and go back to the room. He refused both times, she said. Infant alarm systems are standard in many hospitals as a way to protect the babies' safety. Newborns wear electronic bracelets that cause alarms to sound and doors to be locked if the baby is taken out of the ward, and newborns are often released only to the mother, whose bracelet must match the baby's. The defense noted Lane and Luciano hired a personal injury lawyer before any charges were brought, suggesting it was intended to put pressure on the police and district attorney to charge Kennedy. That would be leverage for a future civil suit, according to the defense. The defense also questioned why, if recounting her story was so emotionally difficult, Luciano laid it out on NBC's ""Today Show"" soon afterward. ""I felt that my reputation was being defamed, like I had done something wrong or horrible,"" Luciano explained Tuesday. She said she wanted ""more clarification to know I did the right thing. I did my job. I did what was best for the baby."" Douglas Kennedy is the youngest son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, who was the younger brother of slain President John F. Kennedy and had served as U.S. attorney general and U.S. senator. He was assassinated in 1968 while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination. The trial is set to continue Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- China's economic success has created a fast-growing middle class and an explosion in domestic travel. Cashing in on the travel boom is one hotel chain that's expanding so fast, it's opening a new property every two days. Budget hotel chain Hanting Inns was founded by billionaire businessman Ji Qi seven years ago. Today it has 1,000 properties in China, across four brands, and Ji expects Hanting to be the world's biggest hotel chain by 2020. The company takes inspiration from Western low-cost hotel chains that cater for frequent business travelers on a budget, such as Accor, Ibis and Premier Inn. ""I first got the idea from a book introducing Accor, about how they open small hotels with less expensive but cozy, clean rooms,"" Ji told CNN's Richard Quest. ""I realized there's a gap in the Chinese market for such hotels as well so I decided to invest experimentally in that niche."" See also: China's unique boutique hotels . Ji identifies three things that Chinese customers look for in a hotel room -- all of which will chime with Western travelers: a soft bed, free internet access and a good hot shower after a long, tiring day. He says his ultimate target is to open 10,000 hotels. His big draw is clean, no-frills rooms that start from as little as $15 a night. ""We only invest in crucial parts (of the hotels). In our lobby you don't see fancy decorations like marble surface or crystal lights,"" said Ji. ""We keep everything simple because our clients don't really pay much attention to that. But we put serious money into our rooms -- in that way we manage to keep our hotels cost-effective."" The sheer scale and speed of economic development within China over the last 20 years has forced hoteliers the world over to sit up and take notice. The number of Chinese people traveling outside China has risen to 65 million a year, overtaking Japan as the largest source of outbound travelers in Asia. See also: Asia's budget airlines go long haul . International hotel chains are adapting their business plans and services to cater for the increasing number of Chinese travelers. Marriott launched its Li Yu program -- meaning ""serve with courtesy"" -- earlier this year, while Hilton Worldwide introduced its Huanying program last August -- tailor-made for the Chinese market, with a name that means ""welcome"" in Mandarin. Paul Brown, brand president at Hilton, told Quest that Huanying offers services including Chinese foods on the breakfast menu, and guest rooms that come with green tea, slippers, and Chinese TV channels. ""We wanted to create a program that made them feel comfortable and welcome when going outside their country for the first time,"" he said. But international players are also moving into China. Accor has tried to gain a foothold in the Chinese market with its Grand Mercure brand, known locally as Mei Jue, and Marriott plans to more than double the number of its hotels in China in the next three years. ""We've got to make sure that we are succeeding with the Chinese traveler and winning their loyalty,"" said Marriott CEO Arne Sorensen. ""The loyalty that we build here can get translated ultimately to loyalty of Chinese travelers going around the globe."" See also: 55 years of Marriott hotels . But Ji believes that foreign competitors will find it hard to compete with Hanting on its home turf. ""We are faster. We are more cost-effective. We know our clients better,"" he said. Ji says he welcomes international customers, but currently 90% of Hanting guests are Chinese business travelers. And with 1.3 billion Chinese people, whose average incomes have quadrupled in the last four years, it's small wonder that for the time being, Hanting is concentrating on the local market.","China's domestic travel sector is expanding at great pace .

"(CNN) -- A scathing resignation letter written by a former city clerk in Pleasant Hill, California, has gone viral after she wished the city ""best of luck in finding some schmuck"" to fill her position. ""This has been an atrocious, incredibly depressing, and mind-numbingly inane experience I would not wish on anyone,"" former clerk Kim Lehmkuhl wrote in her resignation letter. ""I wish the City the best of luck in finding some schmuck eager to transcribe every last misogynistic joke, self-indulgent anecdote, and pathetic pandering attempt by Council, and every tinfoil hat conspiracy theory, racist aside, and NIMBY asshattery from the lovely Council meeting frequent flyers, without which, surely our democracy could not flourish. June, also best of luck with your imminent unfunded pensions scandal, that is going to be a rough one."" The letter was addressed to Mayor Tim Flaherty and City Manager June Catalano. It became public after it was admitted into the record during a council meeting Monday. ""At least her resignation demonstrated her ability to craft a full sentence with colorful language,"" Flaherty told CNN, adding that there was a recall effort under way to remove Lehmkuhl. ""Every councilmember had called for her resignation,"" he said. ""We had to hire people to do her job."" CNN reached out to Lehmkuhl via Twitter and e-mail but did not receive a response. In a blog dedicated to her clerk campaign, Lehmkuhl wrote she ""would be honored to have the opportunity to serve our local community as your City Clerk."" She adds, ""I am committed to helping Pleasant Hill residents stay engaged in our community, and to keeping City Hall accountable, ethical and transparent."" Martin Nelis, the city's public information officer, told CNN that residents had complained that Lehmkuhl would post offensive tweets during public meetings about what was being discussed. ""Residents criticized her for tweeting during meetings rather than taking notes or recording the proceedings of the meetings for the formal minutes process,"" he said. The Twitter account Lehmkuhl used has since been disabled. ""We are not quite sure why she ran for office in the first place, what her expectations were once elected. We have never received a complete answer. Obviously what her expectation was is different of what the public and the council expected of her,"" Nelis said. Flaherty said he considered sending the letter back to Lehmkuhl and asking her to rewrite it but instead settled for, ""Your decision is best for you and for the City of Pleasant Hill.""","Former city clerk of Pleasant Hill, California, quit with blistering resignation letter .

"(CNN) -- As a generation, millennials have been called coddled, under-qualified, whiny and, recently, ""screwed."" Apparently, both our egos and our grade point averages are wildly inflated. Thanks for your input, everyone. I'm listening. But there's a time for taking constructive criticism, and there's a time to take it personally. What better time than now? It's fight or flight at this point. Some cards are stacked against us (a rough job market and poor economy, for starters), and now we can add to that a serious PR problem. We have never looked worse. Because of all that, we've got a chip on our shoulders. We're frustrated, angry, tired and scared â€” the ultimate underdogs. But I think we deserve more credit, and it's up to us to prove it. A millennial's plea: We must vote . Ours are the hands that will shape the next decade â€” culturally, socially and economically. So instead of thinking about being ""millennial"" as something that happened to us, why don't we figure out how we will define it? Despite the headlines, we've proven to be a pretty smart, organized and resourceful generation already. Here are some reasons to be hopeful about what millennials will do in the decades to come, and how we members of ""Generation Y Me?"" can make it out of our current crisis. We're brave . There are plenty of young people accomplishing feats and pushing boundaries right now, and I'm glad they're on team millennial. Take Alex Morse, for example. He's the 23-year-old mayor of Holyoke, Massachusetts, the town where he grew up. Since he took office in January, Morse has focused on increasing traffic to Holyoke's downtown and created a new government position to promote local art. He also happens to be openly gay and surprised many people by getting elected at all. Morse says he frequently speaks with other motivated young people and believes despite its sometimes bad rap, the millennial generation is ambitious. What they don't teach you in college: Job-seeking as a millennial . ""I wouldn't be here today if I listened to the people who told me I was too young to be mayor,"" he says. ""Make a decision about what your goal is, and your life has to revolve around what that goal is."" The young mayor believes there's a logical place to start for millennials looking to change the world. ""People often think they have to go to a capital city or to a different city to improve their community, but what better place to improve than where you come from,"" he says. ""If we all improve the communities we were born and raised in, that could go a long way in improving our country."" Maya Enista Smith, the chief operating officer at Mobilize.org, is another millennial all-star. And she believes in us, too. The first-generation American is 28 now, but when she was just 17 she helped to register 30,000 voters as East Coast coordinator for the ""Rock the Vote"" initiative. For the past seven years she has worked at Mobilize, an organization dedicated to empowering and investing in millennials, who Smith thinks are ""uniquely positioned"" to solve the challenges the United States is facing. ""What typifies this generation is they have a real idealism and hopefulness about what the future is going to look like in our hands,"" Smith says. We're skilled and driven . Remember not too long ago when we were clawing each other's eyes out to get into college? Memories of that level of crazed intensity make me cringe (let's try to forget the day I cried over a bowl of tomato soup in the cafeteria about a bad quiz grade), but also suggest that as a generation, we can't be all that lazy. Cash-strapped millennials curate style via social media . Maybe the biggest source of hope is how ""overscheduled"" we were as children. Our parents were criticized for enrolling us in Little League, ballet class and science camp all at once. But when you think about it, we ""overscheduled"" kids might be the uber project managers of the future. We're built to multitask, and we're not afraid to learn and adapt. Though mean overall SAT scores have gone down a bit since the 1970s, math scores have actually gotten better, according to the College Board. The percentage of students ages 14 to 17 who are enrolled in school has increased over time, from 84% in 1950 to 94% in 1970 to 97% in 2010. Plus, many more American children are bilingual now than they were in the past. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the number of school-age children who spoke a language other than English at home increased from 4.7 million to 11.2 million between 1980 and 2009 â€” up from 10% to 21%. And their English skills are increasing. Among children who don't speak English at home, the percentage who spoke English ""with difficulty"" dropped from 41% in 1980 to 24% in 2009. We're the future, like it or not . I'm not denying that we're facing some huge challenges. But that's an exciting jam to be in. It's likely that a member of our generation will solve some of the questions currently keeping us up at night: Will our government ever come together in a spirit of compromise to enact laws that will help us all? How will the music industry make money despite the overwhelming number of people downloading? What is our best source of low-cost energy? How can the journalism industry position itself to create more revenue? Someone will eventually answer those questions or create new industries that render the problems obsolete. Millennials' time to shine comes at a precipitous moment in history. When I was wrestling with a constraining university newspaper budget, a frustrated professor told me, ""If you can figure that out, you'll have saved the journalism industry."" Why not? It's time to stop letting other generations tell us who we are and find out for ourselves. Are you a millennial who is tired of being counted out? Do you agree with the criticisms of millennials?

"(CNN) -- It doesn't sound like it should be that hard. The challenge: Design an aircraft that, powered only by a human, can reach 3 meters (9.84 feet) in altitude and hover for at least 60 seconds. And yet that dare, first issued in 1980, stymied the world's best flight engineers. Dozens of teams tried. Only a handful managed to get their ""human helicopter"" off the ground. None won the elusive $250,000 Sikorsky Prize, established by the American Helicopter Society for the first team to accomplish the feat. Until this year. Thirty-three years after the Sikorsky Prize was established, a Canadian team led by Todd Reichert and Cameron Robertson claimed it in June with a 64-second flight in an indoor athletic arena outside Toronto. While Robertson tracked their progress from the field below, Reichert powered their delicate aircraft by pedaling a bicycle-like apparatus that twirled four enormous rotors. 11 Kickstarter projects that raised $1M or more . Their achievement was the second flight milestone for Reichert and Robertson, who are becoming pioneers in the small but emerging field of human-powered aviation. Three years ago the pair built perhaps the first flapping-wing aircraft, powered by a human, to sustain flight. All of which raises a logical question: Why do these things? What's the point of designing aircraft that hardly anybody will ever fly? ""There's not ... practicality to a lot of what we do,"" admitted Robertson. ""You won't be flying your human-powered flapping-wing airplane or your human-powered helicopter to work. ""But all of our projects challenge people's conventional way of thinking,"" he told CNN at the recent PopTech conference in Camden, Maine, where he and Reichert were cheered for their innovative approach to problem-solving. ""We really want people to understand that impossible is nothing,"" he added. ""And just because someone says you can't do something, doesn't mean you (can't). With the application of passion and persistence and innovative, creative thinking, you can really take on any challenge."" Photos: The Wright brothers take flight . Modern-day da Vincis . Leonardo da Vinci sketched plans for the first human-powered, flapping-wing aircraft, known as an ornithopter, more than 500 years ago. Since then, of course, a fixed-wing design has become the standard for airplanes. But that hasn't stopped aerospace engineers from trying make a variety of ornithopters fly. Reichert and Robertson, graduates of the University of Toronto, launched their ornithopter project in 2006 and began flight testing their aircraft, the Snowbird, three years later. The plane had a wingspan of 105 feet -- comparable to that of a Boeing 737 -- but weighed only 94 pounds. A car towed the plane into the air to get it started, while Reichert sat in a small cockpit and pumped a bar with his feet to operate a system that flapped the wings up and down. With every failed test flight -- which broke more than a few planes -- the two engineers learned a little more. ""Basically, with these aircraft, the mantra is, 'You don't fly any higher than you're willing to fall.' And that tends to keep you fairly safe,"" Reichert said. ""We've had some crashes, but no real injuries."" Unusual energy sources of the future . Finally, in August 2010, in a suburban Toronto field, Snowbird was able to sustain altitude and airspeed for 19.3 seconds while covering a distance of about 475 feet. Reichert, Robertson and their team believe the brief flight set a world record for an aircraft of its kind. Then came the human-powered helicopter. The team built the aircraft, dubbed Atlas, in three months, but it took another nine months of crash-filled flight testing before they hit their target. ""Whenever we had a big crash, it was devastating. It took so much of our time to piece Humpty Dumpty back together again. The whole helicopter is built sort of like a house of cards -- if one thing goes, the entire thing falls apart,"" Robertson said. ""But every time we picked ourselves back up (after a crash), we would know a little bit more than last time."" Innovative shelter pods help the homeless through winter . A land speed record . In 2012, Reichert and Robertson established AeroVelo, a company dedicated to seeking sustainable enginering and design solutions to technological challenges by using human-powered vehicles as a teaching platform. Now the two young engineers have their sights on another big goal: Setting a land speed record for the fastest human-powered bicycle. In September, they went to Battle Mountain, Nevada, for the World Human-Powered Speed Challenge, where teams compete on flat desert roads to race aerodynamic bicycles as fast as cars. Pedaled by Reichert, their entry Bluenose -- a recumbent bike encased in a sleek carbon-fiber shell -- reached speeds of 77 mph on flat ground. ""The fact that a human engine -- about the equivalent power of an electric motor the size of your fist -- can power a bicycle at the same speed as that of a car, which has a hundred times or more the power, is really the innovative and inspiring thing that we think people should understand,"" Robertson said. Malls of the future . Reichert and Robertson plan to return to Battle Mountain next year with a faster bike and take aim at the world speed record of 83.8 mph, set this fall by a Dutch team. Unlike the ornithopter and the helicopter, a human-powered, high-speed bike might actually have a future as a practical mode of personal transportation. But even if it doesn't, Reichert and Robertson will keep pushing against the boundaries of what humans can achieve. The two young Canadians believe their biggest contribution to flight and speed engineering may be to inspire others to tackle what seems insurmountable. ""It's very easy to say something's impossible,"" Reichert said. ""It's much more difficult to change your assumptions, and change your context, to make something possible.""

"(CNN) -- In response to Russia's invasion and annexation of parts of Ukraine, President Obama this week announced new sanctions against 11 Russian and Ukrainian officials. These sanctions, issued in concert with similar announcements by the European Union, are wildly disproportionate. Disproportionately small, that is. We are ignoring the lessons of history that demonstrate how unusual and unacceptable invasion and annexation are in the post-World War II era. Russia has unleashed a process of domination and annexation that will lead to territorial acquisition by force. Although this has been roundly condemned rhetorically by many world leaders, including our own, the paltry international response thus far indicates that this aggression is not being taken seriously enough. We do not live in a Napoleonic age when force of arms determines boarders. The United Nations has codified the modern view of the international community -- a view that utterly rejects ancient practices of conquest by force. Further, forceful international reaction to banditry like that of Russian President Vladimir Putin provides the opportunity to reinforce the new norm and the strength of feeling followed by the commitment to enforce it. The sanctions announced by the Obama administration and our European allies not only fail to measure up to those new standards, but this rap on a few knuckles will surely encourage the Russian aggressors and alarm its neighbors. There are no more than 20 instances of attempted aggression, invasion and annexation since the end of World War II. North Vietnam's conquest of South Vietnam in 1975 followed two decades of war attempting to resist it. Timor was annexed by Indonesia in 1975, leading to two decades of guerrilla war and eventual independence. The international community never recognized the annexation, and vigorous UN peacekeeping and engagement was critical to solution. Morocco's annexation of the Western Sahara has led to almost 40 years of war and continuous international efforts at negotiation. The invasion and annexation of Kuwait in 1990 led to a massive international effort to reverse that move, involving a half million American troops. Argentina's invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982 was met with full-fledged naval warfare by the forces of the United Kingdom. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and imminent territorial annexation must be viewed in this historical context. The bogus referendum this past weekend fools no one. The international response so far is to deny visas to a small group of Russian officials and deny them access to whatever property they have stashed abroad. This simply is not enough. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and I introduced a resolution earlier this month outlining specific steps we believe the administration should take to sanction and isolate Russia. The full Senate unanimously supported that resolution, yet the administration has chosen to take none of these steps. Last week I asked Secretary of State John Kerry if the State Department is considering any of the recommendations we put forward, ideas backed by all 100 United States Senators. His reply was dismissive and nonresponsive. Sanctioning a handful of Russians most responsible for this aggression is a good first step, but too little to influence a change in the Russian position. Much more needs to be done. There is strong bipartisan support for more forceful economic sanctions than what the administration announced on Monday. We must take more meaningful -- and more properly proportionate -- steps to respond to this outrage of aggression. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"Washington (CNN) -- The National Mall's Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial will be ready for events later this month commemorating the 50th anniversary of his ""I Have a Dream Speech."" Sandblasting on King's monument was completed Thursday night after delays over a company not having proper insurance. The National Park Service's Historic Preservation Training Center ended up doing the work, said spokeswoman Carol Johnson. The park service, which was not initially aware that the sandblasting would be required, is ""very happy"" with the completed project, she said. The remainder of the scaffolding will be taken down in coming days. The completion of the work follows the removal of a controversial written message inscribed on the memorial's side. The memorial had originally included a paraphrase from the famed Civil Rights leader's ""Drum Major"" speech that read: ""I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness."" In 2011, famed poet Maya Angelou, a friend of King, pointed out that the statue took the original quote out of context in a manner that she said made King look arrogant. Americans urged to live MLK's ideals at memorial dedication . Two months before he was assassinated in 1968, King in fact said: ""If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter."" The work at the site is expected to cost between $700,000 and $800,000, according to Bob Vogel, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. The money is coming not from taxpayer dollars but from a fund established for repairs. The memorial, designed by Chinese artist Lei Yixin, opened in the summer of 2011. It features a large statue of King carved into the centerpiece ""Stone of Hope,"" a large block set apart from the memorial's ""Mountain of Despair,"" from which it appears to emerge. King gave his famous speech at the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28, 1963.","Sandblasting completed on King Memorial .

"(CNN) -- When Jay Kwon Yang died from stomach cancer in Virginia in 2012, he left a dream unfulfilled: world travel. The environmental engineer and owner of a dry cleaner wanted to see Europe. And Africa. Even California or not so far away Florida. But he never got the chance. He was just 52 when he died. For more than a year, his 25-year-old daughter, Jinna Yang, couldn't grow past the grief of losing her father, who had raised her, along with a brother and half-sister, almost single-handedly. So she decided to take her father on the trip of his dreams. (You can read Yang's moving tribute to her father on her blog.) Buddy pictures . Traveling for a month in April with a portable, life-sized cutout of her father, New York-based Yang trekked across Europe and posed for pictures in front of famous landmarks, from Skogafoss Waterfall in Iceland to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. ""I have a good friend whose father is an industrial designer -- he helped me score the cutout so that it folded in and out,"" Yang tells CNN. ""It became portable enough to carry around after I folded it up."" ""I took the time to appreciate the little things,"" says Yang. ""In every city I went, I took time to sit and soak in sights. ""Whether it was a huge waterfall in Iceland or a local cafe in Florence, I just sat. I loved watching the couples pass by in the romantic city of Florence, water crashing against rocks on the Italian Riviera, even the peacocks I saw on the island of Lokrum off the coast of Croatia."" Iceland was the most ""life-changing"" destination for Yang. ""I had never done anything so adventurous, and the entire country seems like another planet sometimes,"" she says. Her cardboard travel buddy stirred curiosity throughout the trip. ""Many people stopped me in the street, asking me if it was a famous person,"" says Yang. ""Most of the time when you see a life-sized cutout, it's of Justin Bieber or One Direction, and it's usually in a nine-year-old's room. ""Lots of people stopped to take photos as well."" Worldwide attention . When she returned to New York, Yang posted her collection of photos on her blog (see gallery above). The photos touched people around the world, though not all of the feedback has been positive. Some commentors on Yang's site have suggested the photos are faked, an accusation Yang denies. ""It's really unfortunate to hear these false accusations but I guess it goes with the territory,"" Yang tells CNN. ""The cutout I took with me was a flat board that stood six feet tall. I scored (it) into three sections so I could fold it up and take it around with me. So, no, I didn't have to pay for an extra seat for dad!"" A ""behind the scenes"" photo of Yang carrying the cutout in front of the Louvre appears on her Instagram page. ""I consider myself an artist, and when I set out on this mission, I wanted to honor my father's memory and take beautiful photos to showcase the project,"" Yang says. ""As any photographer knows, in order to create that 'perfect image' there are times that editing is required. ""I do edit my work, and so does my photographer friend who took the photos. The white border around the cutout was cleaned up to make for a more beautiful photograph in many of these shots. ""It is sad that people are questioning the authenticity of the entire project, but ... I am grateful for the positive support I've received from the community. ""The purpose of this project was not to make the perfect picture, but to bring peace to my family and inspire people to find hope and the courage to continue."" Travel as therapy . Now back in New York, Yang is planning another European tour she hopes to take in July. ""Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom to know which direction to go,"" says Yang. ""I was broken, and because I allowed myself to accept that, I found the strength to make a change. ""I had talked about going backpacking through Europe, but when I (actually) booked the ticket and started planning the trip, it gave me something to look forward to again. ""I became confident in my ability to do something, and discovered hope in my future again.""","Grieving daughter honors dead father by posing for pictures across Europe with his life-sized cutout .

"(CNN) -- What's at stake in the conflict between the West and Russia over Ukraine is not just the future of Crimea, it's the future of international order. Some weeks ago, Crimea was a remote place, to historians known as the center of a war in the 1850s, while ordinary people would have associated it with some kind of sparkling alcoholic beverage. But suddenly and unexpectedly, Crimea has become a geopolitical hotspot in a conflict between Russia and the West that seems to be straight out of a Cold War playbook. Moscow has raised the stakes dramatically with a de facto annexation of this region, which is home of an important Russian naval base and inhabited by a population whose majority is oriented towards Russia (while an important minority, among them the Cossacks, is strongly attached to Ukraine). It is unclear at the moment whether President Vladimir Putin sees this only as a first step, which may be followed by an invasion of other parts of southern and eastern Ukraine. What is clear is that Russia is not going to leave anytime soon. 'Soviet Union lite' The tactics and strategies of de facto-annexation have already been displayed in the Georgian regions Abkhazia and South Ossetia after the Russian-Georgian war in 2008; we're likely to see them now in Crimea. Under the cover of sham legality, the region will in essence be fully controlled by Moscow. The current leadership in the Kremlin has never accepted that Ukraine, which achieved independence in 1991, is a sovereign state. It considers Ukraine to be in its sphere of influence, which means that on important issues the country must -- in Russia's view -- ask Moscow for permission. Putin's broader plan is to recreate some kind of ""Soviet Union lite,"" a ring of countries under Moscow's control, with the goal of boosting Russia's geopolitical standing. Ukraine is the cornerstone of that project. The downfall of President Yanukovych and the triumph of the popular Maidan movement in Ukraine have signaled to Moscow, however, that it is losing its grip on Ukraine and that its grand strategy is going nowhere. As the new government in Kiev appears committed to a close association with the EU and as Putin had lost indirect means of control, he decided to use armed force to win Ukraine back -- or at least to deny the West what he sees, in his terms, as the West's victory. Moscow has been consistent in viewing Ukraine as a satellite country but the West has constantly ignored the risk that Russia could use armed force there. Yes, there was the precedent of the war in Georgia, but back then Moscow had at least some arguments to back up its narrative of a humanitarian intervention, while the Georgian side lost its nerve and acted preemptively. And the U.S. and the EU were all too happy to accept Moscow's version of events and continue to do business as usual. The Ukrainian situation is different in many regards. First, there were no serious ethnic tensions that could serve as a pretext for Russian intervention. Second, Ukraine lies between the EU and Russia, which means that the West simply cannot ignore a Russian aggression because of geographic proximity. Thirdly, the EU is already deeply involved in Ukraine. In the case of Ukraine, the West is not going to accept Moscow's narrative. This is too obviously a case of aggression -- the use of force violating Ukraine's sovereignty. But Putin must have calculated that nevertheless the price for challenging the West over Ukraine won't be too high -- that the West is not going to unite behind a strong response. Western cracks . Is he right? Signs of disagreement about the proper response are visible. On Sunday, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier publicly voiced doubts about the proposal to exclude Russia from the G8. Berlin's tactic is to continue to act as if Russia were ultimately a constructive partner, which just has to be brought back to its senses through intense dialogue. While Berlin wants to offer carrots to bring Moscow back on the path of virtue, others think the time for sticks has come. Washington is preparing measures to step up economic pressure. But inside the EU there is no unity about the proper reaction. The West is far from a united stand and a forceful response. Worse, instead of keeping their differences behind closed doors, Western cracks are all too visible, emboldening Putin. It's safe to assume that the Western reaction is shaping Putin's course of action. Moscow fears isolation and economic retaliation. The money that permits the Russian leadership to pursue costly and risky foreign policy adventures comes in large part from the EU, as payment for gas and oil. And substantial parts of the investments of the Russian elite are in the EU as well. But it doesn't look as if the West is using its leverage. This caution may backfire. It may incentivize Putin to go beyond the de facto-annexation of Crimea and try to split larger parts away from Ukraine. Western policymakers should raise their game and understand what is at stake. If Russia goes beyond Crimea, there is the risk of a major war with Ukraine. No government can simply watch as another country invades its territory. Acting like an empire . Beyond Ukraine, this conflict is also a defining moment for future Russian foreign policy. If Moscow succeeds in Ukraine, it will come to the conclusion that it can act like an empire. An empire has no borders and doesn't respect the borders of others. Moscow's pretext of protecting allegedly threatened Russian passport-holders could be used against many countries. If the operation in Ukraine succeeds, it will scare many neighboring countries and prompt them to try to buy off Russia. Safe borders and sovereignty are core principles of the global order, enshrined in the United Nations charter and in other documents -- many of which Russia has signed. Russia is a stakeholder in this system, its U.N. Security Council seat is an important element in ensuring its standing as a great power. It is also in Russia's interests to insist on the sanctity of borders as it has itself a stronger neighbor on its south-eastern side -- China. Moscow cannot put the sovereignty of others into question without risking its own sovereignty. Power vacuum . What is at stake in Ukraine is broader than just the region. If the EU and U.S. accept Russia's land grab, they weaken the foundations of today's international order, born out of the ashes of World War II and enshrined in the U.N. charter. A situation where powerful states set conditions according to their own interests and weaker ones have no choice but to accept is precisely what this charter is aimed at preventing. If one state can invade another without being attacked, without having an international mandate and a clear backing by international norms (such as the responsibility to protect), the foundations of today's international order will be at risk. In the past, it was the U.S. that promoted and guaranteed the U.N.-order. In the role of a global quasi-sovereign, and faced with major threats, it sometimes violated this principle itself. But these were exceptions to the overall beneficial role the U.S. played in the promotion of a liberal democratic order. Nowadays, however, Washington is diminishing its global footprint, with its taxpayers no longer willing to bear the biggest chunk of the burden to uphold world order. The Kremlin has sensed a power vacuum and is stepping in. Now the West must decide whether to accept the new rules Russia is setting in its neighborhood -- or whether it has the power and strength to defend an order which has brought it decades of freedom, security and prosperity.

"(CNN) -- The first thing offered to me at Suntory's Yamazaki whiskey distillery -- the birthplace of Japanese whiskey -- is a glass of water. It's so delicious it comes as a shock. Even before the reason is explained to me, I'm asking: why does it taste so crisp, so different? The distillery is surrounded by beautiful bamboo forests on a mountain -- they must be getting to my brain. It turns out the water in the area is the reason the first whiskeys in Japan were distilled here. ""The distillery was built here almost 100 years ago for the legendary water,"" says Makoto Sumita, who's been with Suntory for 20 years, as we walk past a pond to the tasting room. Drawn from deep mountain wells and designated one of the best mineral waters in the country by Japan's Ministry of the Environment, Yamazaki's water is also reportedly the inspiration for the legendary Japanese tea ceremony that originated centuries ago. These days, it's used to make some of the most remarkable whiskeys on the planet. For some, Japanese whiskey even trumps Scotch as the go-to after-dinner dram. Secret's out . Any serious whiskey drinker is likely to recall, with perfect clarity, where and when they had their first taste of Japanese whiskey. My first was a Hibiki 17, on a first date in Hong Kong two years ago (I was latecomer). From the first sip, I loved how approachable it was, with hints of sweet fruit mingled with the oak. For most drinkers, the draw of Japanese whiskey isn't just that its smoother, complex taste belies its years -- it's the allure of being let in on something rare and refined. ""Drinkers seeking new flavors and tastes are increasingly turning to Japan for new drinking experiences,"" says Whisky Magazine editor Rob Allanson. ""There are some whiskies that have become esoteric, like the Karuizawa, which are hard to obtain and represent a holy grail for drinkers and collectors."" ""People who care about what they drink want something more interesting, not just the same selection (available at) any duty free store,"" says Richmond Lee, owner of Nocturne, the latest high-end whiskey bar to open in Hong Kong's trendy Central district. Despite a prominent display of Scotch (Nocturne stocks 150 different whiskeys), Lee says his customers overwhelmingly seek out Japanese selections. ""What really surprised me was that female customers comprise a third of my clientele and they drink Japanese whiskey straight,"" says Lee. ""I think it's because it's more smooth and sweeter than Scotch. And from a value perspective, with Japanese whiskey you don't need to go for an older vintage to get quality."" Out-Scotching Scotch . Thus is the world of whiskey being shaken. The 21st-century ascendancy of Japanese whiskies recalls the Judgment of Paris, the 1976 blind-tasting wine competition in which California wines were rated the best in every category for the first time, sending shock waves throughout the Francophile wine world. For the past decade, Japanese brands have begun to outrank Scots labels, a similarly unimaginable phenomenon. It started in 2001, when Nikka's Yoichi 10 was named ""Best of the Best"" by Whisky Magazine. Then the Yamazaki 12 won gold at the International Spirits Challenge in 2003. Since then, Japanese whiskeys have consistently taken home medals at most major tasting competitions. At the International Spirit Challenge 2013 held in the UK, Suntory was named ""Distiller of the Year"" for the third time and its blended Hibiki 21 Years Old won the Trophy prize, the highest award in the competition's World Whiskeys category. Though in terms of global sales Japanese whiskies amount to barely a drop in the glass -- none are among the world's ten best selling brands -- Japan's top distillers have seen a steady increase in production and exports since at least 2006, with Suntory expecting to double its overseas exports by 2016. Archrivals of alchemy . Hibiki. Yamazaki. Hakushu. Yoichi. Taketsuru. Miyagikyo. The most highly regarded Japanese whiskeys (the exception being Ichiro's Chichibu) are produced by the distilleries of Japan's great rivals, Suntory and Nikka. Suntory is the reigning king to Nikka's scrappy underdog, but Nikka holds its own on the battlefield. This year's $16 billion purchase of Jim Beam made Suntory the world's third-largest distiller; meanwhile Nikka's exports reportedly grew by 18 times between 2006 and 2012. Both their origin stories can be traced back to the same place, the Yamazaki distillery, built in 1923. That's when Suntory founder Shinjiro Torii hired Masataka Taketsuru, the godfather of Japanese whiskey, to set up the country's first whiskey distillery. Taketsuru had gone to Scotland to learn the craft of whiskey making, and returned to Japan with a Scottish wife. After 10 years with Suntory, Taketsuru left to build his own whiskey empire in Yoichi, Hokkaido, in a climate he preferred for its similarities to Scotland. Japanese whiskey tour . My Japanese whiskey pilgrimage begins from the Yamazaki station, with a 25-minute scenic train ride from Osaka. The countryside along the route is dotted with traditional houses and bamboo groves. The heady aroma of whiskey mingles with the clear mountain air. Unlike the bastions of Scotland's finest, the Yamazaki distillery is one of the few in the world that can produce a variety of whiskeys from the same distillery, thanks to the different shapes and sizes of the distillery's pot stills. With its 3,000 casks, the storage room is the most impressive sight on the distillery tour. In the Japanese tradition of obsessive and innovative craftsmanship, the wood used in these casks has been the subject of extensive experimentation. While 200-year-old American white oak has traditionally been the wood of choice, Yamazaki has also introduced virgin Mizunara (Japanese oak) barrels to give aromas of kara (incense) and sandalwood. The tour finishes at the beautifully rendered whiskey library, bar and gift shop where visitors can purchase varieties sold only on site -- including extremely rare single cask whiskeys -- in addition to the usual Suntory offerings. Onward, to the north . Two days later, I'm on my way to Nikka's main distillery in snowy Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's four main islands. What a different world it is. The train ride to the Yoichi distillery is a stunning journey, past snow-dusted forests and white mountains, with the train running perilously close to the sea. At tiny Yoichi station, which has been blasted by alarming snowfall, only a handful of people get off. The Nikka headquarters are as different from Suntory's as a building can be -- a stone castle, with its own European-style insignia carved into the entrance. It's the Winterfell of whiskey distilleries -- stark and gray and empty. The focus of the tour is emphatically on Taketsuru's astonishing story. Photographs, journals, maps of Scotland, even snatches of tartan are displayed with detailed captions explaining how they influenced Nikka's founder. Unlike the light, modern feel of Suntory's bar, Yoichi's bar looks like an old boys' club, with mahogany finishes and mood lighting. I take a whiff of the rare single casks that can only be bought here. Their scarcity makes them pricey compared with many older blends. Single Cask Yoichi 20 (500 ml) is ¥15,000 ($147), while Single Cask Yoichi 15 (500 ml) sells for ¥10,000 ($98). While a Nikka whiskey may be closer to Scotch than say, a Yamazaki, Japanese whiskeys are still much sweeter and more fragrant than their overseas counterparts, with even the most peaty varieties still balanced. Drinkers of Islay Scotches might enjoy the Single Malt Yoichi Peaty and Salty available at the distillery. I end up purchasing a bottle for ¥6,500 ($64). Grand finale . The highlight of the tour is the airy, open tasting room, where each visitor is given three samples of Nikka's most popular whiskeys. Setting down my tray next to the window, I look out at untouched fields of snow-covered trees and take my time sipping. I've been traveling to Japan since I was a child -- of all the onsens and sushi restaurants and shopping forays and mountain walks I've done and loved, I have to say, this is my absolute favorite Japan experience. Until my next visit, anyway.

"(CNN) -- Conan O'Brien has called Martin Short the ""funniest guy ever,"" but, at times, Short's sunny outlook has come at the expense of great loss. His big brother, David, died in a car accident in 1962 when Short was 12. By the time he was 21, he'd lost his mother and father. His wife died of ovarian cancer in 2010. Yet, through it all, Short has kept in mind a valuable lesson he took to heart after David's death: ""Something terrible can happen to you, and yet, the day after this something terrible, the sun still rises, and life goes on. And therefore, so must you."" The actor and comedian, known for his stints on ""SCTV,"" ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""Primetime Glick"" and a number of movies, spoke to CNN about his memoir, ""I Must Say: My Life as a Humble Comedy Legend"" (HarperCollins), which comes out Tuesday. In person, he is just as gracious, energetic and seemingly pixie dust-covered as the Martin Short who frequents late-night talk shows. That's no act. The naturally cheerful Canadian rejects the notion that he uses comedy to dull the pain. Instead, he says, he has gained wisdom from the events. He looks at the bright side, even when thinking about loss. Channeling Ed Grimley . Short never expected to hit it big. Though he grew up idolizing Frank Sinatra and hosted a faux variety show from his attic bedroom in his hometown of Hamilton, Ontario, Short maintains he was too far, psychologically, from the United States to harbor Hollywood dreams. The youngest of five, Short grew up in a boisterous, fun-loving Irish-Catholic family. His father, born in Ireland, worked as a steel company executive. Short's mother served as concertmistress of the symphony orchestra in Hamilton. Short was studying social work until his friend Eugene Levy persuaded him to give acting a chance. His second professional audition was in 1972 for the Toronto production of ""Godspell."" He and Levy were cast with Victor Garber, Gilda Radner and Andrea Martin, among others. Paul Shaffer was the musical director. It was their collective big break. But Short had a bigger break midway through the show's 1972-73 run. He met a ""forbiddingly attractive"" understudy named Nancy Dolman. They started dating and eventually married. ""The miracle of Nan and me is that once we started,"" Short wrote in the book, ""we never stopped; we remained forever devoted to each other."" Even after ""Godspell,"" he thought he'd missed the boat. In the mid-1970s, Radner and Shaffer headed to ""Saturday Night Live."" Pals like Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Candy and Harold Ramis were working on a pre-""SCTV"" show called ""Second City Television."" Short felt like his own career was in a rut. Short recalled a 1977 incident in which he froze in his tracks while walking along Los Angeles' Santa Monica Boulevard. Intimidated by his friends' successes, he sat on a bench and silently brooded for 15 minutes as Dolman held his hand. The breakdown was short-lived. The next day, Short joined Toronto's Second City troupe, where he debuted some of his most popular characters, including Ed Grimley. Originally, Ed was a device Short used to defuse arguments between him and Dolman. When Short was becoming too much for her to handle, she'd summon Ed. With his hunched shoulders and upper lip exposing his teeth (the high hair would come later), sweet Ed would smooth things over in a way Short confessed he was too stubborn to do. Over time, Short hiked up Ed's trousers, gelled his hair to a point and costumed his character in an old orange-checked shirt. The character became hugely popular. Nevertheless, long after they moved to L.A., Short noted in the book that Dolman never let him forget about his moment on the bench. ""Look, honey, there's Breakdown Corner,"" she would say. An all-star comedian . He joined ""SCTV"" in 1982. He still considers it his ""most satisfying professional experience."" ""There are certain times when the stars align and everything is ideal,"" he said. ""In this case the end result was fabulous. The execution was fabulous. I was living in my hometown. I was working with lifelong friends. People loved the product. The product deserved to be loved. And those stars lining up don't always happen."" ""SCTV"" ended in 1984, and Short made the jump to ""Saturday Night Live"" as part of what became known as the ""all-star cast,"" a group that included Christopher Guest, Billy Crystal and Harry Shearer. ""I had a one-year contract [at 'SNL'],"" Short said, ""so I knew I was not going to be there longer than a year, so I treated it like I had 22 specials to do that year."" Shortly after his time on ""SNL,"" he made his feature film debut in 1986's ""Three Amigos!"" That film is also where Short befriended Steve Martin, with whom he would collaborate professionally many times, notably in the ""Father of the Bride"" films. He plays a depraved dentist in the forthcoming Paul Thomas Anderson film, ""Inherent Vice."" His work has not gone unnoticed. He won a Tony for his performance in the 1999 production of the musical ""Little Me"" and has an Emmy for writing ""SCTV."" His other honors include being named to the Order of Canada. These days, Short is probably most associated with his wild talk-show appearances, whether it's on David Letterman's show -- he's been a frequent guest -- or hosting his own, including ""Primetime Glick."" Letterman, he said, has been a stalwart, and he'll miss the longtime star, who's retiring next year. ""I'm deeply sad to see him retire, because I think he has a completely unique voice on television,"" Short said. ""It's a voice that people trust. ""I keep going back to the first show after 9/11. He was the first one back and people were watching his lead. He was so profound in that moment. And then, again, when he was memorializing Robin Williams. And he's so deeply funny, and so original. There's no one like him,"" he added. ""It's horrifying to think no Dave on TV."" But for a guy who both loves and mocks showbiz, there's one brush with fame that stands out. Several years ago, Short met Elizabeth Taylor, who was fond of one of Short's lesser projects: the 1994 oddball cult favorite ""Clifford,"" in which the 40-ish Short played a bizarre 10-year-old boy. Taylor, she told Short, was ""a total 'Clifford' freak."" Short still seems surprised. ""It was the most random thing I ever thought I'd hear upon meeting Elizabeth Taylor.""","Martin Short's memoir details love, loss, life and celebrity encounters .

"Orange, California (CNN) -- Ian Chung is nestled in darkness. Born just 24 weeks into gestation, he weighs scarcely more than a pound. He can hear the faint sounds of the outside world mingling with the soothing sound of his mother's voice. His spindly arms and legs shake as he lets out a warble. ""Oh, my love,"" coos his mother, Julie Chung, 31. ""You're going to be OK."" Julie's hands descend -- one landing lightly on Ian's chest while the other pushes against his jerking legs. She is using touch and light pressure to simulate, for her premature son, her own womb. A few moments later, Ian stops crying. ""When he was born he was so tiny,"" said Chung. ""It was like, 'Oh wow, can a baby even survive outside the womb this early?'"" Medical advances are improving outcomes for even the tiniest babies. Experts say fewer than 1% are born in the ""micro preemie"" category; at the hospital where Ian is being treated, Children's Hospital of Orange County in California, that means born before 28 weeks or born weighing less than 2.2 pounds. ""Survival rates (among micro preemies) have been improving,"" said Mindy Morris, a neonatal nurse practitioner at Children's Hospital. ""So they may survive to discharge. But then growing up as children they have a lot of complications."" Doctors and nurses at a specialized unit at Children's Hospital have implemented a system they say is dramatically reducing disability and infection rates among this rare preemie population. Aptly named the Small Baby Unit, the staff work under the cover of darkness and quiet in a separate wing of the hospital. Here, stimulation is kept to a minimum; speaking is only done in hushed voices. The overall effect is one of relative calm: an attempt to mimic what babies would experience if they were still safely tucked in utero. ""We try to keep it low sound, low lights, so that it is as close to the womb as we can get,"" said Morris, coordinator of the Extremely Low Birth Weight Program at Children's Hospital. ""We try to minimize the intrusion to them."" In 2009, before the Small Baby Unit was up and running, 45% of babies were discharged with chronic lung disease. In 2012, after the unit had been operating for three years, the rate was down to 27%. Infection rates from 2009 to 2012 dipped from 41% to 15%, and feeding, weight and head circumference have also improved. Dr. Kristi Watterberg, chairwoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on the fetus and newborn, said that developing processes to treat extremely low birthweight babies is -- broadly speaking -- a good thing. But since Children's Hospital's data are self-reflexive, she questions what exactly is contributing to the unit's success. ""When someone starts focusing on something, it tends to trend better,"" said Watterberg. ""What made it happen? We don't know."" Watterberg said that some elements of what is being done at Children's Hospital, including various forms of touch therapy, can be beneficial to premature infants. A large study published in 2004 found 21% to 48% greater weight gain among infants undergoing moderate massage therapy; they also were discharged sooner from the hospital. Other studies suggest that specific types of massage therapy stimulate production of growth hormones and promote bone development. At the Small Baby Unit, parents act as ""therapists"" and partners with the staff, so they are engaged fully with their child's progress. Studies show that mothers who massage their infants experience decreased depression and anxiety. 'It can hurt to be touched' Chung is learning about the thin line between stimulating and overstimulating her son. ""For preemies, it can hurt to be touched because their skin isn't ready for it,"" explained Karin Mitchell, a developmental therapist working with Chung. Mitchell grabs Chung's hand. ""Let me show you on your hand,"" she said, pressing on Chung's palm to show her how firmly to touch Ian. ""It's not heavy, but it's also not superlight."" ""Remember, when he was inside the womb there was amniotic fluid, and there was a feeling of that moving across every skin cell of his body,"" Mitchell said. ""That's what helps babies know, 'Where do I start and where do I stop?' ""When babies are born early like Ian, they don't have that option, so now they have to learn their body in the midst of air. It's a lot different."" Soon, Ian will lie -- tubes and all -- skin-to-skin on his mother's chest for an hour or more, something referred to as kangaroo care. Painful medical interventions like intubation, extubation and blood draws are performed while a baby is skin-to-skin with a parent whenever possible. In those situations, touch is thought to mitigate pain. ""Kangarooing,"" as mothers here refer to it, also helps with bonding and regulating things like respiration and sleep among babies. For mothers, it may stimulate breast milk production. ""It calms me when he's 'kangarooing' with me, and I notice he's more calm,"" said Chung. She pauses as tears roll down her face. ""It's nice to know that those things help him. You cling to those little things that can ease things for him."" Ian's care here is in stark contrast to what he got during his first few days of life, in a traditional NICU at another local hospital. There, according to his parents, the lights and noise were blaring. ""(This unit) is a laser focus on this very specific patient population. I think that is what makes this so unique,"" said Dr. Kushal Bhakta, medical director of the Extremely Low Birth Weight Program at Children's Hospital. ""Other places I've worked you will have a tiny premature baby next to an older child who has a heart condition, next to another child who may be crying,"" he continued. ""So there's ... a lot of other stimuli to this little tiny preemie and it's not done purposely. It's just the layout of whatever unit they're in."" Watterberg of the American Academy of Pediatrics said it is important to strike a balance, adding that theories and approaches regarding noise in the ICU are constantly evolving. ""We used to think it should be quiet, so when these babies came into the world too soon, we'd turn off the lights and make it quiet,"" said Watterberg, a professor of pediatrics and neonatology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine. ""Turns out babies were hearing a fair amount of noise in utero, and that maybe if it's too quiet they are not hearing the kind of language they need."" She cites recent research that suggests too little sound could interfere with a baby's acquisition of speech and language, and that exposure to speech can enhance brain development in babies. Similarly, she said, too much darkness could be counterproductive to a baby's development, since in utero a baby would be exposed to a stream of information from its mother reflecting her own changing circadian rhythms. ""We know that what happens in the ICU affects babies long term,"" said Watterberg. ""So I'm pleased that this group is working on it, but the information we have is always in process."" Numbers . In the Small Baby Unit, numbers mean a lot. When Ian was born, they went something like this: 47% chance he'd survive, and if he did survive, only a 31% chance he would escape serious neurodevelopmental problems. Chung and her husband, Ryan Chung, temper the harsh reality of those statistics by focusing on other numbers â€” milestones Ian is reaching from day to day, week to week. Ian has already defied the steep odds that he would not survive: Today, he is 7 weeks old. ""We celebrated 10 grams last night,"" said Julie of Ian's weight gain since he was admitted to the Small Baby Unit. ""It's like '(He is) 2 pounds! Wow!' "" The Chungs believe that Ian's future prospects are improving because of his treatment -- in particular, the emphasis on touch -- in the Small Baby Unit. Three weeks and 10 ounces later, he is less reliant on supplemental oxygen and is less averse to touch. ""Julie, you want to massage him?"" asks Mitchell. ""Yes,"" says Chung, who glances up at the numbers changing favorably on a monitor above her. ""He likes it."" Weeks earlier, the monitor beeped incessantly. Today, Ian seems relatively calm -- more OK with his surroundings. Although some of the science behind what happens in the Small Baby Unit eludes her, Chung knows that one alternative -- little or no contact between her and Ian -- would leave her empty emotionally. She recalls an article she read recently describing how most NICUs operated years ago. ""Moms wouldn't touch their kids,"" said Chung. ""They would look at them through the glass wall. My heart broke for them. ""Not to be able to hold them or touch them or do any of that stuff?"" she added. ""All of that fulfills what I long for. It gives me something, even though it's little.""","Fewer than 1% of babies are ""micro preemies,"" a term that varies in definition by hospital .

"(CNN) -- Syria's vice president is calling for a ""historic settlement"" of the country's civil war and the creation of a national unity government, according to an interview with a Lebanese newspaper to be published Monday. ""The solution has to be Syrian, but through a historic settlement, which would include the main regional countries, and the members of the U.N. Security Council,"" newspaper al-Akhbar quoted Vice President Farouq al-Sharaa as saying in excerpts released Sunday. Al-Sharaa, who also once acted as Syria's foreign minister, noted that neither the rebels nor government has the military ability to reach what he called ""a conclusive end."" ""This settlement must include stopping all shapes of violence, and the creation of a national unity government with wide powers,"" he said. Al-Sharaa, a Sunni Muslim in a government dominated by the country's Alawite minority, was rumored to have defected to Jordan in August, but he later resurfaced in Damascus. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told Turkish media then that al-Sharaa is not to blame for the mass bloodshed in the country. ""Farouq al-Sharaa, with a reasonable and conscientious approach, was not a part of recent events and did not partake in the massacres. And perhaps there is no one that knows the system better than Farouq al-Sharaa,"" Davutoglu said, according to the Turkish Anadolu Agency. Al-Sharaa has clout as a prominent member of the government's old guard, serving as foreign minister under President Bashar al-Assad and his late father, Hafez, for more than 20 years. Turkish state media said in October that some Syrian rebels were open to the idea of al-Sharaa leading an interim government. But rebel leaders have not indicated to CNN that they support that idea. Meanwhile, Syrian warplanes bombarded a densely populated Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus on Sunday amid clashes there, opposition activists said. Airstrikes hammered the Yarmouk camp in the southern part of the capital, opposition activists said. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said warplanes shelled a school and a mosque, and reported at least 15 deaths. The air assault comes with fighting over the past 48 hours between rebels and a pro-government Palestinian militia, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Palestinian faction is led by Ahmad Jibril, a longtime leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command, one activist and news outlets are reporting. Read more: Rebels gaining ground in Aleppo, opposition says . Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas urged combatants in Syria ""to spare our camps and our people in Syria"" and not draw the Palestinians into the civil war. He also called on the world community ""to take immediate action"" to protect Palestinians in Syria. Rebels and the government have gained and sought support from Palestinians in Syria. ""We are very worriedly following the situation,"" Abbas said, according to the WAFA news outlet. ""This must be stopped immediately."" Many displaced Palestinians have been living for decades in Yarmouk, a nearly square-mile district inside Damascus about five miles from the center of the city. Formed in 1957, the urban enclave is the largest Palestinian refugee community in Syria, with more than 148,500 registered refugees, the United Nations said. Refugees in Yarmouk appear to have been well-integrated into Syrian society, working as doctors, engineers, civil servants, laborers and street vendors. The United Nations said living conditions in Yarmouk ""are far better"" than they are in other refugee camps in Syria. There are more than 486,000 Palestinian refugees living in nine official and three unofficial camps across Syria, the United Nations said. Most of the Palestinian refugees who fled to Syria amid the founding of Israel in 1948 were from the northern part of the area -- mainly Safed and the cities of Haifa and Jaffa, the United Nations said. Palestinian refugees were among those who fled from the Golan Heights to other parts of Syria after Israel occupied that area in the Six Day War in 1967. Rebels intent on overthrowing al-Assad's government are working to seize ground in and near Damascus. More than 40,000 people have been killed in 21 months of conflict. At least 150 people were killed across the country Sunday, the LCC said. Opposition groups also said rebels and regime forces battled near a hospital in the Hama province town of Halfaya. Twenty-five people died there, the LCC said. Read more: How the Patriot deployment to Turkey will work . ______________________________________________________ . Editor's note: CNN wants you to know that we got word last Thursday night that Richard Engel and his team were missing. NBC News asked us not to report that news -- and we complied. CNN has complied with such requests before and likely will again. Often in the first few days after a non-combatant goes missing -- whether it is a journalist, a member of a non-government organization, or other company employee -- CNN is asked, as are other news organizations, to delay reporting the story. The reason is so fact finding and any negotiations to free them can take place before their capture becomes a worldwide news event. Hostage negotiators say that once the global spotlight is on the missing, the hostages' value soars, making it much harder to negotiate their freedom.

"(CNN) -- Tensions between Palestinians and Israelis spiked in Jerusalem Thursday as Israel closed access to the Temple Mount, a move Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called a ""declaration of war."" Presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh told CNN that the decision to close off the site, which includes the al-Aqsa Mosque, was a ""brazen challenge"" and ""grave behavior"" that would lead to ""further tensions and instability."" Israeli police said they closed the Temple Mount ""to prevent disturbances"" after the drive-by shooting of controversial activist Rabbi Yehuda Glick on Wednesday night. Ofir Gendelman, the Israeli Prime Minister's spokesman for Arab media, tweeted Thursday that the closure was ""temporary & meant to prevent riots & escalation as well as to to restore calm and status quo to the Holy Places."" Later Thursday, Israeli police announced that they would reopen, in part, the Temple Mount. The site will only be open to men over the age of 50 and women of all ages on Friday to prevent demonstrations by young Muslim men, police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. The police presence in the eastern part of Jerusalem has been beefed up, and security will be increased around the old city and alley ways in the area of the al-Aqsa Mosque, said the spokeswoman. The Jerusalem complex is the holiest site in Judaism and the third holiest site in Islam. Jews call it the Temple Mount and Muslims know it as Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary). Earlier, Rudeineh told the WAFA news agency, the official Palestinian news service, that Israel's act was a ""declaration of war on the Palestinian people, Palestinian religious sites and a declaration of war on both the Arab and Islamic states."" Israeli police shot and killed a suspect in Glick's shooting Wednesday night. An Israeli counterterror unit surrounded the house of the unnamed suspect in the shooting, police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said on Twitter. He said the man opened fire on police, who shot and killed him. Glick is an advocate of Jewish access to Jerusalem's fiercely contested holy sites. After he gave a presentation in Jerusalem on Wednesday night, a man on a motorcycle shot him. Rosenfeld described the attack on Glick as an ""attempted assassination."" The rabbi was hospitalized in serious condition. Contested site . The site, with its golden dome overlooking Jerusalem, is said to have hosted sacred events in both the Jewish and Muslim religions. Rabbinic sages say that God gathered dust from the spot to create Adam, the first man, before setting him loose in the Garden of Eden. Jewish tradition holds that the Temple Mount also contains Mount Moriah, where Abraham, the Hebrew patriarch, is said to have nearly sacrificed his son -- under God's orders -- before an angel intervened. Later, Israeli King Solomon constructed the first Jewish temple on the mount, including the Holy of Holies, a room that kept the Ark of the Covenant, which was said to contain the tablets on which God wrote the Ten Commandments. Muslims believe that the Prophet Mohammed was carried on a flying steed from Mecca to the Jerusalem site during his miraculous Night Journey, said Muqtedar Khan, an expert on Islam and politics at the University of Delaware. ""It's all about al-Aqsa,"" said Khan. ""That's why all Muslims are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause."" According to Islamic tradition, the night journey took Mohammed to the same Jerusalem rock on which Abraham nearly sacrificed his son, where the Muslim founder led Abraham, Moses and Jesus in prayers as the last of God's prophets. That rock is now said to sit in the Dome of the Rock, whose golden roof gleams above the Old City skyline. Since its construction in the seventh century, the Haram al-Sharif, now controlled by an Islamic trust, has been an almost constant source of tension between Muslims and Jews. In the 1980s, Jewish radicals plotted to blow up the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa, believing that it would lead to a spiritual revolution and usher in the Messiah. In 2000, the Second Intifada -- a 5-year-long Palestinian uprising -- was sparked, Palestinians say, after Ariel Sharon, then a candidate for Israeli prime minister, visited the compound surrounding al-Aqsa. Sharon insisted that his visit was not intended to provoke Palestinians, but many saw it as an attempt to underline Israel's claim to Jerusalem's holy sites. CNN's Michael Schwartz and Daniel Burke contributed to this report.","NEW: Israeli police announced that they will reopen the Temple Mount .

"(CNN) -- The family of a man whose lifeless, naked body -- wearing what appeared to be a dog collar -- was found in a hot tub next to a sleeping weatherman described him Thursday as someone who was ""easily influenced."" ""Dex had a very loving but trusting heart,"" the family of victim Dexter Paul Williams, 24, said in a statement released by their lawyer, Thomas Nichols. ""Anyone who knew him would agree that he was easily influenced."" Christopher Barbour, 36, said he awoke Monday morning in his home outside Little Rock, Arkansas, to find Williams' body at the bottom of the empty tub, his face blue and purple and a chain around his neck, a Maumelle Police Department report said. Asleep next to the corpse was KARK meteorologist Brett Cummins, 33, who had arrived at Barbour's house with Williams on Sunday night, Barbour told police. In a statement issued on Cummins' behalf, lawyer Mark Hampton said Thursday that his client was devastated by the death of his friend. It added that Cummins was cooperating with authorities investigating the death and ""looks forward to a conclusion of the inquiry, secure in his own innocence and confident that no foul play was involved."" On Sunday night, the three men had drunk and snorted illegal narcotics, though Barbour could not identify the drugs, according to a report by Officer Gregory Roussie. Around 10 p.m., Cummins and Williams moved into the hot tub, where Barbour joined them later; they continued drinking until Barbour retired for the night around 11, falling asleep on his couch in the living room, the report said. Around 8 a.m. Monday, Barbour awoke to Cummins' snoring and discovered his two guests -- but no water -- in the hot tub, he told police. ""He observed that Dexter's head was lying behind Brett's left shoulder,"" Barbour told police, according to the report. Barbour said that after he awakened Cummins, the two men saw that Williams' face was discolored and his skin cold. Cummins screamed and ran to the living room, where he vomited next to the couch, Barbour said. Maumelle police and fire rescue arrived at the home around 8:10, and they found Williams' body in the tub, a ring of blood around his head, the report said. In the master bedroom, police found a pill bottle next to a pair of khaki cargo shorts on a storage ottoman, Sgt. David Collins said in his report. No arrests had been made, but an investigation was under way, Lt. Jim Hansard told CNN on Thursday. ""We don't have a crime -- yet,"" he said. ""That's part of the investigation."" KARK made note of the incident on its website. ""Our Meteorologist Brett Cummins was at the home at the time of the death and we felt we should share this with our viewers,"" the report said Tuesday. ""Brett will not be on the air as he is mourning the loss of his friend. Our thoughts go out to the family and friends of Dexter Williams."" Police said they are not releasing preliminary autopsy results. The family's statement asked for privacy.

"(CNN) -- So your daughter will just die if she doesn't wear a princess costume for Halloween? And of course it has to be pink. And every little girl you know wants to be a princess for Halloween, except for the neighborhood tomboy down the street? Is this desire to be a princess hardwired? Do girls just come that way, wanting to look pretty in pastels? And does this explain why teenage and adult women are drawn to ""feminine"" careers, and likely to be less competitive in sports and at work than their male counterparts? That's what some research scientists think. They argue that differences between boys and girls are in large part because of variations in hormonal levels during gestation, and thus begin before birth. On average, fetuses that become girls are exposed to less testosterone in the womb than those destined to be boys. Lower exposure to testosterone, some scientists claim, makes girls more passive and less adventurous than boys, and more interested in dressing up, looking nice and pleasing others. These scientists admit that some girls embrace a much wider range of interests and behaviors than those that are stereotypically ""feminine."" But they argue that such girls were exposed to higher levels of testosterone in the womb. The bottom line, according to this school of thought, is that it doesn't much matter how parents raise girls. Their paths are predetermined before birth. There's little point in giving girls gender-neutral toys or encouraging them to think beyond their wedding day. Most girls will naturally gravitate toward pink princess dresses and white wedding dress fantasies, and most women will avoid traditionally ""masculine"" activities and aspirations. We had a unique opportunity to test this theory by analyzing data that followed 342 women for more than three decades, from when they were still in their mother's womb as fetuses until adulthood. We had measures of how much testosterone each woman had been exposed to in the womb. We also had measures of the kinds of messages the girls had received from their parents. They had answered questionnaires over the years where they described whether their parents had pushed them toward feminine activities or encouraged them to play with a range of toys, including those traditionally viewed as masculine. We found that the level of testosterone exposure in utero did have a small effect on how adult women described their personalities. On average, women exposed to more testosterone reported being less passive and were more likely to exhibit ""go-getter"" personalities. But this only explained about 4% of the differences in the adult women's personalities. Far more important, indeed two to three times as important, was what parents had encouraged their daughters to do and be. Women who were more assertive and confident as adults were much more likely to report that their parents had encouraged them to be active and independent. So, by all means, let your daughter be a princess this Halloween if she insists. But also let her know how powerful she looks as a Hunger Games rebel leader, a warrior queen, a pirate captain, or even a ninja, because our research suggests that what you say now will have a powerful effect on the options your daughter will envision for herself later in life. And if she just has to have that pink dress, just remember that less than 100 years ago, many people thought blue was a more appropriate color for girls than pink, because pink was perilously close to red -- a strong, passionate, and yes, masculine color.","Risman, Davis: Are girls hardwired to want pink princess Halloween costumes?

"(CNN) -- Elation over the first German victory in Australia's Melbourne Cup has been dampened by the death of two horses at the event. The race favorite -- Japanese-trained Admire Rakti -- collapsed and died in his stall, minutes after crossing the post in last place. Later Araldo was reportedly put down after being spooked by a boy with a flag on his way back to the stalls causing the seventh-placed horse to suffer a serious leg injury. Stallion Admire Ratkti had struggled in the race despite being widely tipped to win after an impressive win in the Caulfield Cup in October. ""The exact cause of death is yet to be determined, although the circumstances of the horse's passing are very rare,"" said Dr. Brian Stewart, the head of veterinary and equine welfare at Racing Victoria, referring to Admire Ratki. He said a postmortem would be conducted. ""Our sympathies are extended at this time to the owner Mr Kondo, trainer Mr Umeda and his staff who cared deeply for their horse and are naturally saddened by their tragic loss."" First past the post in prestigious Melbourne Cup was Protectionist, a five-year old trained by Andreas Wohler, and ridden by English jockey Ryan Moore. ""He has won very easily and that is a very good horse,"" Moore said. An ecstatic Wohler said: ""It's unbelievable. We'll probably later think about it and it's a moment you won't forget in your life."" The five-year old -- one of the most inexperienced in the field -- won by four lengths, ahead of Britain's Red Cadeaux, which placed second for a third time out of four starts. New Zealand's Who Shot Thebarman came third. Second horse injured . After being spooked Araldo reared up and kicked a fence, badly injuring his right hind leg. The stallion was examined on site before being taken by ambulance to the University of Melbourne Veterinary Hospital. There, vets determined his injuries were too severe, and he was euthanized. Last year, Verema was euthanized after snapping her cannon bone and dropping out of the race at the halfway mark. The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses (CPR) asked on its Facebook page whether the ""party was really worth it?"" ""A recent study by CPR found that 125 horses died on Australian racetracks over a 12 month period,"" added the horse protection organization. ""Thousands more are also sent to the knackery when no longer profitable. ""Today added two more casualties to those statistics."" Just three weeks ago, Admire Rakti -- trained by Tomoyuko Umeda -- took first place in the Caulfield Cup, putting the seven-year-old in prime position to take out the Melbourne Cup. Just hours before the race, commentators speculated on whether he could take the rare double. Ridden by Zac Purton, Admire Rakti started out strongly but showed signs of discomfort with several hundred meters to go. ""It's very sad. He gave me a great thrill at Caulfield and for this to happen to him is just not fair,"" Purton said. ""I didn't think they'd beat me. I thought he'd win today and the whole way through the first half of the race I thought that too."" The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) released a statement saying it expects a full investigation to be conducted into both incidents. ""Events like these are a stark reminder to the community of the real risks to horses associated with racing,"" the statement said. ""Sadly, injury and death are the price some horses pay for our entertainment in a sport that puts intense pressure on animals to perform to the limits of their endurance."" The Melbourne Cup is the biggest event on the country's racing calendar. There's a public holiday every year in Victoria, the southern state where the race is run. Elsewhere around the country, work stops and many schools pause to watch the race live on television.","Race favorite, Japan's Admire Rakti dies immediately after race .

"(CNN) -- Republican Joni Ernst has won the race for Iowa's U.S. Senate seat held by retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, defeating Democratic challenger Bruce Braley, according to a CNN projection. The win in the Hawkeye State, which voted for President Barack Obama twice, joins a list of Republican pickups that have swept the party into the Senate majority. National Democrats were initially confident they would hold the seat but Ernst surprised them with a determined and effective campaign. The importance of the seat was evident by the millions of dollars outside groups poured into advertising, making it one of the most expensive races of the cycle. The polls were neck and neck through much of the campaign with Ernst appearing to get a small lead over Braley recently. Ernst was a little-known Iowa state senator when she burst on the national political scene during the GOP primary, declaring in a TV ad that if elected she would cut pork spending in Washington the way she castrated pigs growing up on an Iowa farm. Conservatives were thrilled. ""Washington is full of big spending,"" she said smiling into the camera. ""Let's make 'em squeal."" The ad set the tone for Ernst's energetic and appealing campaign. It helped her get past some voters' concerns that as a tea party favorite she was too conservative to take the seat held for five terms by progressive Democratic stalwart Sen. Tom Harkin. The popular Harkin campaigned for Braley but couldn't make up for several gaffes and missteps the four-term lawmaker made during the campaign that surprised and disappointed his supporters in Iowa and Washington. At one point, he appeared to belittle both Iowa farmers and the state's senior senator, Republican Chuck Grassley. He described Grassley, who is in line to chair the Judiciary Committee if the GOP takes over the Senate, ""as a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school."" Braley was also criticized when it was revealed his family had filed a complaint against a neighbor whose chickens were crossing onto his property. Ernst raised the issue at a recent debate. ""You elect to sue a neighbor over chickens that came onto your property. You're talking about bipartisanship, how do we expect, as Iowans, that you will work across the aisle when you can't walk across your yard?"" she said. At the same debate, Braley argued Ernst would side with the far right wing of the GOP Congress. ""I'm a bridge builder not a bridge burner,"" Braley said. ""Sen. Ernst would have voted to shut down the federal government. She's called President Obama a dictator and thinks impeachment should be on the table""","Republican Joni Ernst defeated Democrat Bruce Braley in Iowa's Senate race .

"London (CNN) -- With the recent headlines emerging from Azerbaijan, you could be forgiven for assuming something more dramatic than a singing competition was about to descend on the country. In recent weeks, the Eurovision Song Contest finals, which take place Saturday, have inspired clashes on the streets of the capital, Baku, between Azerbaijani police and opposition activists, and accusations by state-controlled media in Azerbaijan that a German ""conspiracy"" was waging an ""information war"" against the hosts. That followed a boycott of the contest announced by neighboring Armenia in March, after the shooting of a soldier on their shared border. Explainer: What is Eurovision? It's all a far cry from American Idol. But Eurovision has always carried higher stakes than its sequins and songs in made-up languages would suggest. A forum for geopolitics . A frothy, kitsch spectacle to some, Eurovision has long been a forum for heated geopolitical grandstanding, with allegations of bloc voting and political skulduggery dogging the contest for years. Documentarian Montse Fernandez Villa has alleged that, as early as 1968, Spanish dictator Francisco Franco orchestrated a campaign of vote-buying that handed victory -- and an important public relations coup -- to Spain, over the favorite, British entry, Cliff Richard. Despite the organizers' efforts to keep the contest apolitical -- the rules state that ""no lyrics, speeches, or gestures of a political or similar nature shall be permitted"" -- European political tensions have often been played out on its stage, says Eurovision researcher Dr Karen Fricker. ""How can it not be? It's a competition of nations,""said Fricker, a contemporary theater lecturer at Royal Holloway, University of London, and co-director of the Eurovision Research Network. ""If it was just a song pageant, it would have disappeared after a few years. But the notion there's something being worked out there that's bigger than song is what gives the contest its interest."" Armenia's withdrawal from this year's competition is the result of tensions that have festered since a war with Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh in the 1990s, which left between 20,000 and 30,000 people dead. But it is not the first boycott to hit the contest. Eurovision's rules hold that the country the winning artist represents has the option of hosting the following year's contest, and the year after Franco is alleged to have snatched victory from Cliff Richard, Austria refused to compete in Madrid as a protest against his regime. More recently, Lebanon pulled out of its scheduled Eurovision debut in 2005 in a spat over its refusal to broadcast the Israeli performance. Lebanese TV channel, Tele Liban, told the European Broadcasting Union, which broadcasts Eurovision, that Lebanon's legislation made it almost impossible to broadcast Israeli content, putting Tele-liban in breach of contest rules. And in 2009, a year after Russian-Georgian tensions had reached a flashpoint in South Ossetia, Georgia withdrew its entry for the Moscow contest, when their arguments that their entry ""We Don't Wanna Put In"" had nothing to do with the Russian premier fell flat with the organizers. A stage to 'perform 'European-ness' Why do states care about a contest that, even in the eyes of its admirers, is of dubious musical merit? Fricker says that, much like the avowedly apolitical Olympic Games, the contest has become an important political forum because of its competitive nature, and the huge television audience it commands. ""It is a unique moment of 'live-ness,' where everybody in Europe is doing the same thing at the same time,"" she said. ""There's a really compelling sense of a shared television space. It's a conduit for unity, but also a way to play out European tensions."" The lure of winning a little of that limelight has seen the contest expand, even as some of Eurovision's founding Western European nations question its relevance. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the number of participating countries has almost doubled to 42, with former Eastern bloc nations joining the fray and, on many occasions, winning. Since 2001, wins for Estonia, Latvia, Turkey, Ukraine, Serbia, Russia and Azerbaijan have seen the ""New Europe"" dominate the contest. Their success, says Warwick University's Dr Milija Gluhovic, co-director of the Eurovision Research Network, was largely down to the fact that they took it fairly seriously; as an opportunity to demonstrate their credentials as modern, independent European states to the rest of the continent. ""They started to realize they can use the contest as a platform to reclaim their European heritage, and show themselves in the best possible light,"" he said. Eurovision victory brought not only a moment of prestige, but more importantly, a rare opportunity to showcase their country to a huge audience when they hosted the following year, said Fricker. Host nations typically use the intermission between performances and the results announcement as an opportunity to ""perform their 'European-ness' to one of the biggest television audiences of the year,"" she added. Fricker cited popular 2001 winner Estonia as an example of a country that used its win, and subsequent host status, to project a positive image and engender goodwill ahead of joining the European Union in 2004. ""It's soft politics, but it's politics,"" she said. The emergence of voting blocs . The new arrivals have not been welcomed by everybody. Their success has fueled suspicion among Eurovision's old guard that the contest has become plagued with tactical ""bloc voting"" -- where groups of countries vote tactically, essentially rigging the voting. In 2008, British broadcaster Sir Terry Wogan quit his Eurovision duties after 35 years, saying the event was ""no longer a music contest."" Research published by a British academic in 2006 would appear to support his position. Dr Derek Gatherer's analysis of Eurovision voting patterns between 1999 and 2005 concluded that bloc voting in the contest had increased. He identified three major voting blocs from which a winner was usually produced: The Balkan Bloc (Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia, Greece, Cyprus, Serbia and Montenegro, Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and Romania), the Warsaw Pact (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Georgia and Moldova) and the Viking Empire (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). By contrast, France, the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy -- the so-called Big Five who make the biggest financial contributions to the contest, and are given an automatic place in the final ---- did not belong to a bloc, and so had not won since the UK's victory in 1997, according to Gatherer. At the time the paper was published, Gatherer successfully predicted that Serbia would win in 2007. However since then, Big Five member Germany has also been successful. Many Eurovision pundits reject the notion that voting patterns are a reflection of something untoward. Fricker says it is natural for countries to vote for neighbors with whom they may share cultural affinities, as the votes reflect public tastes. ""They like each other's music and in fact are a musical community in terms of the artists and producers that circulate,"" she said. John Kennedy O'Connor, author of ""The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History"" said he did not believe any organized tactical or political voting occurred, as the contest's current judging format -- a mixture of public televoting and national judging panels -- made it ""virtually impossible"" to rig results. Sour grapes? An Englishman based in the U.S., O'Connor said he saw the allegations of tactical voting as sour grapes toward the successful newcomers. He said in 2003, the first time a British entry had been awarded the dreaded ""nul points,"" one of the singers from the duo Jemini suggested their low score could have been politically motivated in response to the UK's involvement in the Iraq War. The view was echoed by many in the UK media. But O'Connor said that, viewing the performance today, he believed the singers were clearly off key. ""Nobody wants to put up their hand and say, 'Actually, that was a rotten song, and it was horribly performed.'"" He said the reason the Big Five countries tended to fare less successfully was because, from the viewing public through to the organizers, they treated the contest ""as a bit of a joke."" ""By contrast, the impression I get is the former Eastern bloc countries take it very seriously,"" he said. But Gluhovic said this was only partly true, as it was ""a bit of a myth"" that the average Eastern European was much more invested in the competition than their Western European counterparts. Gluhovic, who hails from Bosnia and Herzegovina, said it was clear that organizers in New Europe were ""serious about sending their best acts."" But as for the viewers? In true spirit of the contest, viewers -- wherever they hailed from across the continent -- tended to share one of three common responses to the show. ""Just like in the UK, some people love it, some people hate it and some people love to hate it,"" he said. ""In this respect, I don't think we have any huge differences.""","Organizers insist it is apolitical, but Eurovision has always been a political stage, say experts .

"(CNN) -- You wouldn't necessarily expect a blockbuster exhibition on women's clothing to open with a giant image of a naked lady. But step inside London's Design Museum and you'll find Eve in all her unclothed glory, hand clasped around an apple before the first bite that sends the rest of us grasping for cover. We've been dressing ourselves ever since, say the curators of ""Women Power Fashion,"" a show chronicling how women have used clothing to empower themselves -- from Joan of Arc's criminally short tunics, to Joan Collins' eye-gouging shoulder pads in Dynasty. ""This isn't an exhibition about fashion, despite the fact that we use 'fashion' in the title,"" said co-curator Colin McDowell, rather cryptically, at the opening. ""It's about clothes and how women have used them to empower themselves, to intimidate people, and to make them feel sexy."" Gaze beyond Eve's naked form and you'll find the black sequined dress given to Princess Diana on her 36th birthday, and a baby-blue two-piece worn by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher after becoming leader of her party. Indeed, what really brings this exhibition to life is not simply the lovingly preserved garments -- but imagining influential women wearing them in a very different world. ""We wanted to look at how fashion mirrors what's going on in society,"" explained co-curator Donna Loveday. ""As women's roles changed over decades, so did what they wore."" Among the vast collection of painfully rigid 19th century corsets, battered broad-brimmed hats worn by the Suffragettes, and towering Manolo Blahnik stilettos, are the personally selected outfits of 26 modern-day movers and shakers. The simple trousers, jacket, silk blouse, and red and white striped scarf owned by Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo may not immediately appear eye-catching -- but it has a special emotional pull. ""This scarf is my lucky charm, it's the one I wore on the evening I won the election for Mayor of Paris"" explained Hidalgo, the first woman to have job, and one who cites former U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton as a role model. ""How one dresses is very important,"" she said at the official exhibition opening, herself clad in a sleek black leather jacket. ""The garment is the presentation of ourselves to others. It's a world in which we have some authority. And by definition, women are considered as not having authority, as being powerless."" Among the faceless mannequins draped in clothes usually worn by some of the most influential women in the world, is a sweeping white satin Prada cape owned by celebrity architect Zaha Hadid. The Iraqi-born British architect also designed the exhibition, creating a maze of mirrors and lime green perspex signs that guide visitors through the decades. ""She behaved in exactly the way one wants Zaha Hadid to behave -- we never saw her,"" said co-curator and fashion journalist McDowell with a wry smile. ""We worked with her, and got missives passed backwards and forwards, but it was an Olympian performance,"" he adds, perhaps in reference to the architect's work on both the 2012 London and upcoming 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama walked into the White House nearly six years ago with a robust Senate majority and a promise to change politics. Now, he's heading into his final years of office estranged from Democrats in the minority on Capitol Hill, facing Republicans uninterested in making big compromises and a public that has largely moved on from the heady early days of the administration. Obama is ""anxious to get back to work"" and put the midterms behind him, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, adding the president regards the final two years of his term as a ""fourth quarter"" with the potential for real action. He is scheduled to address the midterm results on Wednesday afternoon, just as he did in 2010 when he labeled the Republican takeover the House a ""shellacking."" The White House invited bipartisan congressional leaders for a meeting on Friday afternoon to map out the lawmaking terrain for the next two years. And administration aides are bullish about extending their strategy of going ahead with executive actions in areas where congressional cooperation appears impossible. But for Obama, the time for major legislative moves that would build his legacy could be short. With the midterms out of the way, the attentions of both parties will soon shift to the 2016 presidential campaign, leaving little appetite for bipartisan agreement. Achieving any legislative deals will require a level of compromise the White House hasn't yet been open to; it will also depend on a fractured Republican Party's willingness to pass measures that have any hope of getting the president's signature. In public, both sides say they're ready to find common ground --""We're ready to compromise,"" Vice President Joe Biden told CNN Monday -- though aides are more pessimistic in private. Asked whether the president will be looking to compromise and take a more conciliatory tone with a GOP Senate, a White House official said the ""better question is whether the GOP wants to work with us."" Previous attempts by the White House to woo Republicans, including dinners and other meetings with Obama, did not materialize into compromise, the official pointed out. Republicans have likewise expressed some willingness to find common ground with Obama, though if four years of rancorous relations with the House GOP are any indication, that willingness may be fleeting. The conservative wing of the party has resisted Obama at nearly every move, so much so that the White House has kept meetings between House Speaker John Boehner and Obama secret. ""What the Republicans are very likely to do is to go in two directions at once,"" said David Gergen, a former adviser to Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. ""On the one hand, they'll try and look as if they were cooperative with the president. On the other hand, they are going to play hardball."" Even with a Republican controlled Senate, conservative brass rings like repealing the Affordable Care Act or making major cuts to government spending programs like Social Security and Medicare will still be blocked by Obama's veto. And while a GOP Senate may still take up those measures to exemplify their ideological splits with the White House, there is virtually no chance they become law. Comprehensive immigration reform, a longtime goal of Obama's that was blocked last year by the GOP controlled House, will likely arise again in the new Congress as Republicans seek to boost their popularity among Latino voters. Some Republicans, like 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, have argued immigration reform might have a better chance of succeeding with a Republican Senate, however the deeply divided GOP caucus in the House hasn't shown many signs of uniting around a plan. Further complicating the equation: Obama's vow to take unilateral action to address the millions of undocumented immigrants currently inside the United States. Originally expected at the end of the summer, the unveiling was pushed until after the midterm votes to avoid political fallout. The White House says they'll announce their plan before the end of the year. That leaves lower-profile items, with less political baggage, for Obama and the new Republican Congress to haggle over. That could include reforming the tax code and brokering new trade deals â€” areas both the White House and Republicans agree need attention. Those are also items that could cause some heartburn for Democrats, whose populist message doesn't necessarily align with lowering corporate tax rates or fostering new trade pacts. Sen. Harry Reid, the Democratic Majority Leader, issued a blow to Obama's economic agenda earlier this year when he refused to allow ""fast track"" legislation on proposed trade deals with Asia and Europe. Some Republicans at the time complained Obama didn't do enough to convince fellow Democrats to support his trade agenda. A GOP-controlled Senate could offer a better chance to see it through. A tax reform measure that lowers rates on corporations could similarly gain more traction in a Republican controlled Senate, though disagreements on the size of the reduction â€” and potential new revenue â€” could stymie any deal. On major legacy-building items, legislative action seems impossible, leaving open the chances for executive actions more limited in scope. He's already moved to curb carbon emissions at coal powered plants, and further climate actions are likely. Officials say he remains committed to closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, despite continued opposition from Congress to transferring prisoners into the U.S. The losses Tuesday won't necessarily change the overall calculus in Washington; gridlock has been the norm at least since Republicans took control of the House in 2010. The way Democrats lost the Senate, however, has caused some consternation within Obama's own party. ""Running away from the president is never smart,"" said one top Democratic strategist who has worked with both the White House and Senate candidates this midterm cycle. ""You look like chicken s---."" Intra-party squabbling is a longstanding tradition for losing parties, and the White House would surely have appreciated more talk of the improving economy on the campaign trail. Administration officials say a major staff shake-up isn't in the works -- for now -- and that Obama isn't planning to come out and accept blame for Democratic losses. He previewed his explanation Tuesday, saying in a Connecticut radio interview the electoral map was to blame. ""This is probably the worst possible group of states for Democrats since Dwight Eisenhower,"" he said. At least for the immediate future, however, the White House is moving on from the domestic political environment that left Obama battered, and in many races, unwelcome. He leaves Sunday for a week-long diplomatic visit to Asia, 6,000 miles from the redrawn Washington.","Obama is ""anxious to get back to work"" after midterms .

"(CNN) -- Satellite imagery that may show debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is raising hopes that investigators can narrow what has been a needle-in-a-haystack search operation. The images, obtained and analyzed by the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation as ""a possible indication of debris south of the search area that has been the focus of the search operation,"" according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, were taken above a remote part of ocean thousands of kilometers south-east of Australia. Two objects, one of approximately 24 meters (78.7 ft) in length and another around five meters (16.4 ft) long have been spotted, leading to hopes that more information regarding the missing airliner has come to light. Beforehand, search corridors had extended both through central Asia and as far south as the depths of the Indian Ocean. The new find gives cause that the search operations can zero in on a much more focused field. However, the area of southern Indian Ocean, 2,350 kilometers (1,460 miles) to the southeast of Perth in western Australia is a remote, potentially inhospitable area of sea which will not necessarily aid search operations -- Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott described the search area Friday as the ""about the most inaccessible spot you could imagine on the face of the earth."" New Day's Chris Cuomo illustrated the difficulty of the task ahead. ""They are saying it's the most challenging of things. It's far, it's remote, it's very deep and you're in the storm season so it's inclement there as well... it's a tough set of constraints,"" he told Richard Quest. The distance from Australia means that the search time of aircraft ""on station"" -- within the reduced search zone -- will be limited to only a couple of hours. Weather will also potentially be an issue. Already, the first aircraft on the scene which was dispatched early Thursday to assess the site, has reported ""poor visibility,"" despite ""moderate weather conditions,"" according to the AMSA's John Young, who spoke at a media briefing Thursday. ""This will hamper both air and satellite efforts,"" he said. CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri says that weather in the region, especially at this time of year, can be unpredictable. ""Today marks the first day of autumn down under, so it's not unusual to see the weather in this part of the world start to pick up in intensity. ""We have very limited (weather) info in this remote corner of the planet. In fact, it is so remote that (weather) satellites are even a bit choppy that far south."" A key to the search is the height of the waves and whether there are whitecaps present, former flight commander Rick Burgess told CNN's Becky Anderson. ""Those high waves... are very disruptive on your search pattern when you're trying to look for objects in the water."" He estimated that the search crews would have a window of three to four days. ""Then from there I don't see much hope in finding anything in the near term."" The average depth in that area of the ocean is around 13,000 feet, which is slightly less than the average depth worldwide. The area's depth could still present significant problems for retrieving wreckage -- should the objects seen on satellite be confirmed as part of the missing plane. There are volcanic ridges underwater which rise up from the ocean floor, which can reduce the depth to 3,000 feet. Also, this part of the Indian Ocean is the location of the Indian Ocean Gyre, one of five major gyres worldwide. A gyre is an area of circular ocean current where water does not circulate particularly freely.

"(CNN) -- In a perfect world, our most popular Twitterer might be a brilliant scientist, writer, philosopher or spiritual leader. In this world, he is an 18-year-old pop star with famous hair. On Monday night, Justin Bieber surpassed fellow singer Lady Gaga to become the most-followed person on Twitter. As of Tuesday morning, The Biebs had more than 33,333,000 followers, while Gaga was closing in on 33,329,000. Both numbers continued to creep up, but it appeared Bieber was gradually increasing his lead. Neither had immediately acknowledged the milestone on Twitter. Gaga's latest tweet was a message to fans about her concert Monday night in Hollywood, California, while Bieber's was a plug for a recent Teen Vogue photo shoot. Based on their respective rates of growth, Bieber and his hordes of Beliebers were projected to overtake Gaga on Sunday afternoon, according to Twitter Counter, but Gaga's Little Monsters put up a fight. The coiffed Canadian crooner is Twitter's first new king or queen since Gaga dethroned Britney Spears in August 2010.

"(CNN) -- The chairman of a U.N. mission whose report accused Israel of  ""actions amounting to war crimes"" during its fight against Hamas says he would have reached different conclusions if the Israeli military had been more forthcoming and if he had known the results of subsequent investigations. ""If I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would have been a different document,"" wrote Richard Goldstone, a former South African jurist, in a Washington Post op-ed column Friday. Israel, which has long been critical of the conclusions presented to the U.N. Human Rights Council on its war against Hamas forces in Gaza in 2008-09, on Saturday called for the body to cancel the findings. ""Everything we said has proven to be true,"" said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""Israel did not intentionally harm civilians, its institutions and investigative bodies are worthy, while the Hamas intentionally fired upon innocent civilians and did not examine anything. The fact that Goldstone backtracked must lead to the shelving of this report once and for all."" There was no immediate reaction from Hamas. Goldstone's report, issued in September 2009, said both Israel and Hamas likely committed war crimes and possible crimes against humanity during the conflict between December 27, 2008, and January 18, 2009. Israeli investigations found cases involving individual soldiers, but the intentional targeting of civilians by Israel was not a ""matter of policy,"" Goldstone now writes. Israel launched the offensive against Gaza militants in response to ongoing firing of rockets against southern Israeli towns. The U.N. Human Rights Council, which assigned Goldstone and others to the fact-finding mission, approved the controversial report, which focused more on alleged war crimes by Israel. Israel later provided the United Nations with a report justifying its actions. Israel said it faced ""asymmetric conflicts"" and blamed ""militants operating from within and behind civilian areas"" for placing civilians at risk. In his column, Goldstone cites a subsequent report by a U.N. committee of independent experts, which found Israel investigated more than 400 allegations of misconduct while Hamas has ""not conducted any investigations into the launching of rocket and mortar attacks against Israel."" ""That the crimes allegedly committed by Hamas were intentional goes without saying -- its rockets were purposefully and indiscriminately aimed at civilian targets,"" Goldstone wrote Friday. Goldstone said Israel should have conducted proceedings in a public forum and been more cooperative during his panel's investigation. ""Israel's lack of cooperation with our investigation meant that we were not able to corroborate how many Gazans killed were civilians and how many were combatants,"" Goldstone wrote in the Washington Post article, adding Israeli has concluded few of its investigations. Asked about whether the Israeli government should have cooperated with the Goldstone commission from the start, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said Saturday the government did not want to set a precedent for bodies it considers hostile to interfere in government decision-making. Hamas, Goldstone said, continues to fire rockets and mortar rounds at civilian targets in southern Israel and should be condemned by the Human Rights Council. The judge wrote of military commanders ""making difficult battlefield decisions"" and that he is confident Israel is appropriately investigating the deaths of 29 members of one family. ""The shelling of the home was apparently the consequence of an Israeli commander's erroneous interpretation of a drone image, and an Israeli officer is under investigation for having ordered the attack. ""Although the Israeli evidence that has emerged since publication of our report doesn't negate the tragic loss of civilian life, I regret that our fact-finding mission did not have such evidence explaining the circumstances in which we said civilians in Gaza were targeted, because it probably would have influenced our findings about intentionality and war crimes,"" Goldstone wrote. Goldstone said since the 2009 report, Israel Defense Forces instituted new procedures for protecting civilians, limiting the use of white phosphorus in civilian areas. The Gaza-based Palestinian Center for Human Rights put the death toll in the war at 1,419, and said that 1,167 of those were ""noncombatants."" The Israeli military released its own figures, claiming 1,166 people were killed and that 60 percent of those were ""terror operatives."" In 2009, when the Goldstone Report came out, Ibrahim Khraishi, the Palestinian Authority's ambassador to the United Nations, called it professional and unbiased. ""This report should not be another report to just document and archive,"" Khraishi said. ""My people will not forgive this council if they let these criminals go unpunished."" But the United States, which along with with the European Union considers Hamas to be a terrorist organization, has contended the report was ""deeply flawed."" In February 2010, Alejandro Wolff, U.S. deputy representative to the United Nations, criticized the report and ""its unbalanced focus on Israel, the negative inferences it draws about Israel's intentions and actions, its failure to deal adequately with the asymmetrical nature of the Gaza conflict, and its failure to assign appropriate responsibility to Hamas for deliberately targeting civilians and basing itself and its operations in heavily civilian-populated urban areas."" Speaking Saturday to Israel's Channel 2, Israel's Liberman said, ""I want to congratulate Goldstone's new conclusions, but I am not surprised by them. We knew the truth, and we had no doubt that it would eventually come out.""

"(CNN) -- If you were observing American elections from the outside, you might be asking yourself the following: . Can't these people make up their minds? Four out of the last five elections (2006, 2008, 2010 and now 2014) were ""wave"" elections in which one party won a sweeping victory. They elect a president of one party, then two years later almost inevitably give the other party a huge victory in the midterm election. Why do they expect things to change? Good question. It's always dangerous to speak of a country of 319 million as having a singular will, or of an election expressing that will. That's particularly true when only about 40% of eligible voters show up for midterm elections. Like every party that wins, the GOP will claim that ""the American people"" have endorsed its agenda in full, and therefore if President Barack Obama stands in its way, then he's thwarting the public's desires. We've established that the public is fed up with a Congress seemingly incapable of getting anything done. The trouble is that the voters -- unanimous in their abhorrence of gridlock -- just delivered a result almost guaranteed to produce more gridlock. To be fair, there was one party assuring them that their votes would do just the opposite. Republican candidates promised voters that they'd stand in Obama's way, and also promised that they'd ""get things done,"" sometimes in the same sentence. As The Atlantic's Molly Ball reported last week, ""these two seemingly contradictory messages are at the heart of Republican Senate campaigns across the country. I've heard them from candidate after candidate."" It's one thing to vote Republican because it's the party that reflects your beliefs. But if you're voting Republican because you want to see Congress become more conciliatory and productive, you really should have been paying closer attention the last six years. That's because obstructionism hasn't been an accident, or a reaction to moves on Obama's part that Republicans found objectionable. It was a strategy they employed from the outset. Literally on the day Obama was inaugurated, Republican leaders gathered over dinner and made a decision to oppose everything he proposed, to deny him both substantive progress and whatever political benefits might accrue to a president who looks like he's accomplishing things. In 2010, Mitch McConnell explained to The New York Times how important it was to present a unified front of opposition to the President's proposals, because then the public would dismiss the debate as just partisan bickering. ""Mr. McConnell spent hours listening to the worries and ideas of Republicans,"" the paper reported, ""urging them not to be seduced by the attention-grabbing possibilities of cutting a bipartisan deal."" As political strategy, it was extremely astute and executed to near perfection. McConnell understood well that the President gets credit when Washington works and blame when it doesn't -- whether he deserves it in either case. So Republicans could pour sand in the gears of government and watch Obama suffer for it. And it worked. What was the result of six years of unprecedented filibusters, debt ceiling crises, a government shutdown, 50 futile Affordable Care Act repeal votes, endless conspiracy theorizing and a dramatic increase in general buffoonery? Republicans took back the House in 2010, and have now taken the Senate. Voters rewarded their misdeeds by returning them to power. And now politicians in both parties are saying they want to come together to accomplish things for the public. The problem is that they don't agree on the things they'd like to accomplish. The argument isn't over means; it's over ends. That'll be even truer when the new Congress is inaugurated in January than it is now. The new class of freshman Republicans in both the House and Senate is even more conservative than the existing GOP caucus (if you thought such a thing was possible), and to them, ""getting things done"" means slashing environmental protections, taking away health coverage from the millions who have obtained it through the Affordable Care Act and cutting taxes on the wealthy. If those new representatives actually managed to turn those beliefs into law, the public would say, ""Hey, we didn't vote for that!"" And they didn't, even in this Republican-leaning year. Voters in four deep-red states -- Arkansas, Alaska, Nebraska and South Dakota -- used ballot initiatives to approve one of the Democratic Party's highest economic priorities, increasing the minimum wage. ""Personhood"" initiatives that would ban abortion failed, not only in the swing state of Colorado but in conservative North Dakota as well. In other words, where voters had the chance to decide policy issues, they chose the Democratic position even as they were voting for Republican candidates. So what do the American people want? They want to have their cake and eat it, too. As political scientists have known for decades, Americans are ""symbolic conservatives"" but ""operational liberals"" -- they like things like small government in the abstract, but they also like all the things government does. They elect Democrats who try to accomplish complex policy goals, then turn around and elect Republicans when things don't work perfectly. They say they hate gridlock, then elect people who will give them more of it. And two years from now, a whole new crop of candidates will barnstorm the country, saying, ""Elect me, and we'll clean up this mess."" And the voters (or at least enough of them) will, despite all evidence and experience, actually buy it.","Paul Waldman: In recent ""wave"" elections, U.S. voters can't seem to make up their minds .
He says they abhor gridlock but have elected GOP lawmakers committed to that very thing .
He says GOP winners said they'd ""get things done"" and stand in Obama's way .
Americans want to have their cake and eat it, too, Waldman says ."
"LONDON, England (CNN) -- King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has begun his visit to the UK as controversy continues over issues related to the Middle Eastern kingdom. King Abdullah is greeted by Britain's Prince Charles at Heathrow Airport. Queen Elizabeth and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown met the king at London's Horseguards Parade parade ground, ahead of a full state banquet at Buckingham Palace. Brown will hold talks with King Abdullah at Downing Street Wednesday before the king's departure Thursday. The UK government regards the state visit, the first in two decades, as being of fundamental importance due to Saudi Arabia's involvement in hot issues such as the war on terror, the situation in both Iran and Iraq and the attempt to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians. But the visit has attracted controversy in the UK from activists on a number of issues. Human rights groups have called on the UK government to react to allegations about the treatment of women and the gay community in the Saudi kingdom, while other protesters have attacked the failure of the Serious Fraud Office investigation into alleged bribes surrounding arms deals. The Press Association reported that around 100 demonstrators lined The Mall, the approach to Buckingham Palace, shouting at the procession as it passed by. Peter Tatchell, a human rights campaigner, told the agency that the UK government was showing ""incredible hypocrisy"" for making no comment about alleged abuses in Saudi Arabia while condemning events in Myanmar and Zimbabwe. ""It just shows oil and arms sales seem to have bought the Government's silence,"" the agency reported him as saying. There have also been allegations by Policy Exchange, a think tank, that organizations linked to the Saudi authorities have promoted Islamic fundamentalist literature in UK mosques.  Watch how royal visit has stirred anger. » . Vince Cable, acting leader of opposition party the Liberal Democrats, has already announced he will not attend events associated with the visit, while several ministers from Brown's ruling Labour party are expected to join a human rights protest outside the Saudi embassy Wednesday. King Abdullah stirred controversy ahead of his visit Monday, accusing British authorities of ignoring intelligence that could have prevented the 2005 London bombings . In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Saudi king said Britain failed to act on information provided by Saudi security services ahead of the suicide bombings on London's transport network in July 2005 that killed 52 people and injured more than 770. ""We sent information to Great Britain before the terrorist atrocities in Britain, but unfortunately no action was taken and it may have been able to avert the tragedy,"" the monarch told the BBC. He refused to elaborate on the details of the intelligence, saying that disclosing specific information ""may cause sensitivities"" between the two countries' security services. A British Home Office spokesman strenuously denied that any intelligence from Saudi Arabia had been overlooked in the run-up to the atrocities and that information provided by the Saudis ""was materially different from what actually occurred on 7 July and clearly not relevant to those acts."" ""We have made it clear that if we had intelligence that could have prevented the attacks we would have acted upon it,"" the spokesman told CNN. He also cited a parliamentary investigation last year that found no evidence that intelligence, passed on by the Saudis, could have prevented the bombings. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband pulled out of a meeting with his Saudi Arabian counterpart in London Monday, but the Foreign Office insisted it was for personal reasons and not a snub. Miliband has just adopted a baby son and is taking time off to look after him, the British Foreign Office confirmed to CNN. Miliband's duties were being carried out by junior ministers in his absence. E-mail to a friend .","NEW Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah begins state visit to UK, meets queen, PM .

"(CNN) -- Cape Town is being overrun by farms. They're spilling out of parking lots, overtaking lawns, even growing out of old TV sets. ""You don't need something fancy to grow in. We have some people grow in toilets and make worm farms in old baths,"" says Louise Vaughan, the field area manager at Soil For Life, a non-profit that teaches gardening and nutrition to Capetonians. The city is in the grips of a vegolution, and it's thanks to the efforts of local food activists, hoping to use these urban farms as a means of battling not just hunger, but poverty as well. Some of Soil For Life's students say the lessons have changed their lives for ever. ""I used to eat a lot of junk food. Now I've changed over. This morning, I had an omelet with things from the garden: spinach, Chinese cabbage, even the stinging nettle,"" says Abdul, who set up his own garden after completing Soil For Life's 12-week course. Cavalleria Primary School, set in one of Cape Town's more disadvantaged neighborhoods, also saw positive changes the lives of their students once they introduced their own food garden. ""Five years ago, our children had lots of white spots on their head. We had medical intervention. It was a sign of malnutrition,"" recalls school principal Hurshele Carolissen. ""Since then, children have taken ownership of this garden. General health has improved, their weight has picked up because they are getting good nutrition. The classroom performance has improved,"" he says. In the last few years, Cape Town has witnessed the proliferation of hundreds of community gardens and urban farms. Abalimi is one organization that has worked to link the city's new micro-farmers with the types of middle-earners eager to fill their cupboards with local, organic produce. Rob Small, Abalimi's co-founder, says that there are hundreds of community farms eager to join their network, though currently about 40 are members. ""There has been huge growth,"" admits Small. ""I think people generally are feeling they want to do something, I think all of us are. We realize by buying something ethically, that gives us an enormous power to change the system.""","Urban farms are taking Cape Town, South Africa by storm .

"(CNN) -- Atlanta's airport is still the busiest passenger airport in the world, but Beijing's airport is closing the gap. More than 94 million passengers went through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in 2013, a decrease of 1.1% over the previous year, according to Airports Council International's preliminary passenger traffic results for 2013. Beijing Capital International Airport came in second place and is continuing to close the gap with Atlanta, reporting nearly 84 million passengers last year. That's an increase of 2.2% over 2012. London's Heathrow Airport remained in third place with more than 72 million passengers, an increase of 3.3%, according to Airports Council International, the worldwide association of airports. There were no changes to fourth, fifth and sixth places. They remained Tokyo International Airport (Haneda), Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. With 66.4 million passengers last year and a 15% increase in traffic, Dubai jumped from 10th place to seventh place. ""With double-digit growth rates in passenger traffic for 2013, Dubai is likely to move up several spots again in the 2014 rankings, solidifying its status as the major hub connecting the east and west,"" ACI World's Economics Director Rafael Echevarne said in a press release. ""Aviation's nucleus appears to be moving eastward,"" he said. ""Other emerging markets such as Turkey, China and South East Asia that have a critical mass of traffic also remain major contributors to the upward surge in air transport demand. This trend will continue into 2014."" Paris dropped from seventh to eighth place, Dallas/Fort Worth remained in ninth place and Jakarta dropped to 10th place. Behind the scenes at the world's busiest airport . Passenger traffic continued to grow around the world, with the world's airports serving nearly 5.4 billion passengers in 2013, growing by 4% from 2012, according to the report. Atlanta's airport still topped the rankings in airplane movements (takeoffs and landings), with 911,000 movements last year. Chicago O'Hare International Airport came in second place with 883,000 movements and Dallas/Fort Worth was third with 678,000. Rounding out that list were Los Angeles International Airport, Denver, Beijing, Charlotte, Las Vegas, Houston and Paris. Hong Kong's airport is still the busiest cargo airport in the world, transporting nearly 4.2 million metric tons of cargo last year. Memphis, Tennessee, home to FedEx, came in second place with 4.1 million metric tons and Shanghai was third with 2.9 million metric tons. (One metric ton equals 2,205 pounds.) Rounding out the top 10 were cargo airports in Incheon, South Korea; Dubai; Anchorage, Alaska; Louisville, Kentucky; Frankfurt, Germany; Paris; and Tokyo (Narita). The Airports Council International preliminary traffic report was based on reports from over 1,105 airports worldwide.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama will sign into law Wednesday the Wall Street reform bill -- the most-sweeping set of changes to America's financial regulatory system since the 1930s. The legislation will vastly reform the way big financial firms do business. This is ""reform that will prevent the kind of shadowy deals that led to this crisis, reform that would never again put taxpayers on the hook for Wall Street's mistakes,"" the president said last week. The bill aims to strengthen consumer protection, rein in complex financial products and head off more bank bailouts. The Senate approved the reforms Thursday on a 60 to 39 vote, ending more than a year-long effort to pass legislation in response to the 2008 financial crisis. To secure enough votes, Senate Democrats made lots of deals, which watered down the bill. For example, Wall Street banks will get wiggle room to make limited risky bets, which is tougher than the current law, but weaker than earlier drafts. The legislation would establish a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau inside the Federal Reserve that could write new rules to protect consumers from unfair or abusive practices in mortgages and credit cards. The bill creates a new council of regulators, lead by the Treasury Department, that would set new standards for how much cash banks must keep on hand to prevent them from triggering a financial crisis. It would also establish new procedures for shutting down giant financial firms that are collapsing. The measure would put new limits on Wall Street banks' speculative bets for their own accounts and their ability to own hedge funds, while leaving the door open for some investment activities. The bill aims to shine a brighter light on some complex financial products, called derivatives, that are blamed for exacerbating the collapse of financial companies such as American International Group and Lehman Brothers. It would force most derivatives onto clearinghouses and exchanges, to better pinpoint the value of the trades. And it would insert a middleman between trades, so that financial firms are less interconnected, to prevent the domino effect of financial firm failures in 2008. ""We made a promise in the fall of '08 that we'd do everything in our power to see to it we'd never again put the American public in the position we were in September and early October 2008,"" Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said after the Senate vote. ""And we have fulfilled that promise with this legislation."" Republicans objected to some of the bill's major provisions, particularly parts that establish the consumer agency and create new rules for the derivatives. While they generally favored more consumer protection and more regulation of derivatives, they argued that the legislation is too heavy-handed in these areas. They also object to the fact that the bill virtually ignores the increasingly insolvent government-owned mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, beyond studying their problems. ""[This bill] is widely expected to stifle growth and kill jobs,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. In fact, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, called for the repeal of the reform bill hours before the Senate even passed it. Yet Republican Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown voted for the bill, joining 57 Democrats to limit debate and move forward. One Democrat, Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin opposes the bill, saying it isn't aggressive enough against Wall Street.","The legislation changes the way Wall Street does business .

"(CNN) -- Doctors in Colorado spotted it first -- a group of 10 children hospitalized with signs of a neurologic illness: limb weakness, cranial nerve dysfunction and abnormalities in their spinal gray matter. Now doctors at Boston Children's Hospital have identified four patients with the same symptoms. Dr. Mark Gorman said the patients, who ranged in age from 4 to 15, all suffered from a respiratory illness before being hospitalized with significant weakness in one or more of their limbs. Each case was different, he said; some had trouble lifting their arms; others had difficulty walking. One has been discharged. Three are still in the hospital. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating the cause of this unknown neurologic illness. Health officials are asking hospitals across the country to be on the lookout for similar cases. ""We don't know, at this point, if there is any association between the enterovirus EV-D68 that's circulating and the paralytic conditions some of the children in Colorado are experiencing,"" CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said Monday. Tests of the Colorado children's cerebrospinal fluid came back negative for enteroviruses and West Nile virus. But a test of their nasal passages found enterovirus in six out of eight patients who were tested. Of those six, four tested positive for enterovirus D68, which has been sending children across North America to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses. The other two test results are pending. Boston Children's Hospital is still awaiting test results for three of the children, Gorman said. One has tested negative for enterovirus D68. ""We are approaching each patient on a case-by-case basis to work them up thoroughly for causes of their weakness and to determine the appropriate treatment,"" he said. What parents should know about Enterovirus . Enterovirus D68 is part of the Picornaviridae family, which also includes the poliovirus, other enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. Enteroviruses are very common, especially in late summer and early fall. The CDC estimates that 10 million to 15 million infections occur in the United States each year. These viruses usually appear like the common cold; symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. Most people recover without any treatment. But some types of enterovirus are more serious. These can cause hand, foot and mouth disease; viral meningitis; encephalitis (inflammation of the brain); an infection of the heart; and paralysis in some patients. Enterovirus: My son was 'like a goldfish gasping for breath' This year, enterovirus D68 seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children who have asthma. The virus has infected at least 443 people in 40 states, according to the CDC. Cases have also been reported in Canada. CNN's Georgiann Caruso contributed to this story.","Doctors at Boston Children's Hospital identify four patients with limb weakness .

"London (CNN) -- Has it really come to this? The nation that gave us the Beatles and the Rolling Stones has decided its best hope of winning the Eurovision Song Contest is a 75-year-old crooner, who last had a hit four decades ago. Or, is the UK's decision to pick as its entry Engelbert Humperdinck, who still has a wide following around the world, a strategic masterstroke to ride the fashion of reviving superstars from a bygone era? Humperdinck's main claim to fame is that his 1967 hit ""Release Me"" denied The Beatles the No 1. spot for three weeks, holding them at number two with their double A-side single ""Penny Lane""/""Strawberry Fields Forever."" He went on to sell more than 150 million records globally and still tours, but the decision to pick him for the Eurovision, which normally showcases emerging acts, still raised eyebrows. The singer, born in India but raised in the English city of Leicester, said of his impending appearance in Azerbaijan in May: ""I'm excited and raring to go."" But Humperdinck's reputation is just the latest to be rehabilitated. Other stars that have become ""cool"" again, years after falling out of favour, include Tina Turner, Tammy Wynette, Sandy Shaw, Dusty Springfield and even The Man in Black, Johnny Cash. Music journalist Paul Stokes, associate editor of Q magazine, says the best revivals were of artists who did not try too hard to be cool. ""I once interviewed Peter Gabriel for Q magazine and he told me he had been in and out of fashion more times then he'd had hot dinners, so had decided the best thing to do was keep doing what he wanted and just put the blinkers. ""I think that's the only way a true artist can have a long career in music. Rock 'n' roll is littered with unseemly and ill advised records that see their creators abandon what made them good in the first place as they chase trends and attempt to stay relevant -- old rockers doing drum'n'bass, country singers trying to be emo, and worse. Ironically those records actually make the acts in question seem less relevant as they blatantly don't get the trends they're copying."" With cultural tastes and aesthetics constantly shifting, the best thing for any longstanding artist to do is stay just true to themselves, Stokes argues. ""Not only will they keep their hardcore fans -- which in a fickle musical climate is no easy thing -- but it seems with the internet seekers always looking for something new, the moment you reach your uncoolest you're suddenly ripe for a sub-culture to come along and proclaim you their godhead. ""Just look at Johnny Cash's career, he was the dangerous outlaw when he started, couldn't get arrested in his mid-career as he became 'parents music,' yet ended his days as the unofficial figurehead of the alt-country scene as his American Recordings albums were widely acclaimed. And they were undeniably cool indeed. And give him credit: he didn't really do anything too different musically, save change the songs he covered, which he did all his career. ""Humberdinck's decision to do Eurovision is interesting. For a while now music journalists like me have been describing Kasabian as 'Leicester's finest' so perhaps he has a point to prove, but while we're going to be hearing a lot more about him in the next few months, I don't think Eurovision will make him 'cool' again, if anything it might have the opposite effect. Remember this is the contest that gave us Gina G.""","UK picks Engelbert Humperdinck as its entry for Eurovision Song Contest .

"(CNN) -- AS Roma hired Luis Enrique hoping a little Barcelona magic might rub off on the Serie A club, but the experiment came to a forlorn end on Saturday when the coach confirmed he was quitting after less than a year in charge. Roma boldly appointed the Spaniard last June, despite the fact that the 42-year-old had never played outside Spain and his only coaching experience was a three-year spell with Barcelona's B team. Ahead of the final round of the season, Roma are seventh in Serie A and may not qualify for Europe. They have been beaten 14 times. Amid increasing rumors about the coach's future, Roma general director Franco Baldini insisted the club wanted Luis Enrique to stay but the Spaniard has confirmed he will step down after Sunday's final game of the season. ""I'm leaving because I feel very tired and drained,"" Luis Enrique said in a statement posted on the Roma website. ""I've given everything this season. ""I don't think I'll be able to recover my energy over the summer -- not the energy needed to motivate a group. I definitely won't be coaching next season, though I don't know if I'd even have had any offers."" Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola also cited fatigue when he announced he would quit the Catalan club at the end of this season. Luis Enrique will become the 20th coaching change in Serie A this season. He arrived at Roma in the wake of a takeover by a group of American investors led by Thomas DiBenedetto last April. On announcing the appointment, Roma's sporting director Walter Sabatini said: ""Luis Enrique represents an idea of football that we would like to follow, which imposes itself today through Spain and Barcelona. ""I was looking for someone outside of Italian football. Uncontaminated."" Luis Enrique was charged with overhauling an aging squad and bringing flair to the team in a notoriously defense-minded league. The 35-year-old club icon Francesco Totti was left on the bench for some games, while Barcelona attacker Bojan Krkic was brought in, but failed to sparkle. ""I still believe you can play attractive football in Italy and I think the best way to do that is with attacking football,"" Luis Enrique said. ""I know that I have to improve defensive aspects and I will, don't worry about that."" Baldini said Luis Enrique's departure wouldn't spell the end of the club's new philosophy. ""The project hasn't failed,"" he said. ""We want to carry on playing a certain type of football, and from league statistics Roma is the team that has had more possession than any other, and is third behind Juve and Milan for territorial dominance and pass completion. ""This says a lot about the quality of play. The failure has been how our league campaign went, but the style of play was want we wanted from the beginning."" Luis Enrique said he planned to stay in the Italian capital for several months to get to know the city better and that he would never regret his decision to try coaching in Italy. However, he said he wouldn't miss the local media. ""Nearly everything that's been written was lies,"" he said. ""And we're still hearing them now.""","Luis Enrique will step down as Roma coach at the end of this season .

"(CNN) -- Blood discovered during the search for Pennsylvania trooper shooting suspect Eric Matthew Frein is not his, state police said Monday. Droplets of what appeared to be blood on the steps of a covered porch near the town of Cresco, Pennsylvania, turned out to be human, the Pennsylvania State Police said. But DNA testing showed the blood wasn't Frein's, police said. Material found on the inside of a screen porch door at a nearby home wasn't blood at all, police said. Neither has any link to the search for Frein, according to police. Police read excerpts of notes they say suspect left . On Friday, a law enforcement source speaking on condition of anonymity told CNN that there was no reason to believe that Frein was injured or that the blood was Frein's. Frein, 31, is suspected in the September 12 ambush shooting that left Cpl. Bryon Dickson dead and Trooper Alex T. Douglass wounded outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove in northeast Pennsylvania. Police have not spoken about a possible motive, other than that Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement. Authorities have said that a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein shows that he had planned the attack. Police: Suspect planned ambush for months . He has eluded escape despite a massive police search around Canadensis, Pennsylvania, where his family has a home. Police say they think a woman taking a walk Friday night saw Frein, armed with a rifle and his face dabbed with mud, in a wooded area near the eastern Pennsylvania town of Swiftwater, about 8 miles southeast of the Canadensis area. CNN's Jason Hanna, Shimon Prokupecz and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","Stains investigated for link to trooper shooting suspect Eric Frein don't pan out, police say .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Nestled within Hong Kong's dense skyscraper jungle, a $640,000 property sits among some of the world's most expensive commercial and residential spaces. The price might sound like a steal. This Asian financial capital has the world's priciest property, according to Savills. Since the start of 2010, average Hong Kong home prices have doubled. But the price tag mentioned here is neither for a home nor an office. It is for a parking space: A slab of undecorated concrete, stained by black motor oil, about 8-feet-by-16-feet in size. Price per square foot: nearly $5,000. Jacinto Tong has owned and used this space for the past ten years. Described in local media as ""the tycoon of parking spaces,"" he is effusive when talking about this particular ""priceless"" gem. ""I think this is the best car park space I ever had,"" said the CEO of Gale Well Group, a property firm that owns hundreds of residential and commercial spaces across the city. ""You can go straight to the office and the elevator. Only 20 steps -- 20 steps!"" The CEO does not own just one $640,000 parking space. Tong owns two. If he were to sell he could bank $1.3 million. ""People don't mind paying more,"" boasted Tong. ""But I'm not eager to sell."" And yet that is the reality for Hong Kong. According to the latest Parking Rate Survey by Colliers International, the global property services firm, this city has the most exorbitant monthly parking fees in the Asia-Pacific. Hong Kong's monthly median parking rate was $744.72 in 2011. With less than a dollar's difference, Tokyo came in as Asia's number two. The reason for Hong Kong's pricey parking rates is rooted in governmental curbs on the city's residential market, said Buggle Lau, chief analyst at Midland Realty, one of the city's largest real estate companies. Many analysts believe Hong Kong's property market is a bubble waiting to burst. To deflate it slowly, the government has introduced a series of increasingly stringent policies since November 2010. These have made it more expensive for investors to buy or flip homes for a quick profit. The regulations have produced desired results, said Lau, leading to a 31% fall in home sale transactions over the past 23 months. But, as a side effect, the squeeze on residential investors has pushed them into commercial property, like parking spaces, which have no such price curbs yet. While homes sale transaction volumes have fallen since November 2010, trade in parking spaces has risen more than 25%, Lau added. The volume of industrial, commercial and retail have surged 16% as well. Fast price rises and higher yields on leased parking spaces have attracted more investors to this niche market. ""If you look at this year's (total sales) number, it's the highest in the past ten years or so,"" Lau said. ""Through November of this year, Hong Kong had car park transactions totaling $751 million. In 2010, it was $525 million."" This rise marks an increase of 43% so far this year. Tong, the parking space tycoon, breaks down rental yields by property category. ""The lowest yield of all property is (retail) shops, maybe less than 2%. The second thing is commercial, which is about 2% to 2.5%, and then residential which is about 3%. Parking spaces should be about 5%."" Hence, some of Hong Kong's hottest investment vehicles are where people keep their motorized ones. But Lau, the property analyst, cautions against casual investment in parking spaces. If Hong Kong's economy stalls the first thing people will get rid of will be their cars. No car means no need for a parking space. But a home will always have a use. ""If you buy a parking space,"" said Lau, ""you can't live in it."" Vivian Kam contributed to this report .","In Hong Kong's Central district, an executive recently offered $640,000 for a parking space .

"(CNN) -- It's been almost 20 years since the first ""Toy Story"" debuted in 1995, but the franchise is still going strong. On Thursday, Disney Chairman and CEO Bob Iger revealed that ""Toy Story 4"" is coming in June 2017 to the delight of pretty much everyone -- well, except those still grieving from ""Toy Story 3."" (Our hearts seriously may never recover.) But everyone else? Totally losing their minds. Yeah, we know you're excited. But as this fan perfectly summed up the news, we've still got a looooong way to go until June 2017. So let's take a trip down memory lane and revisit the movie that started it all, shall we? Here are five things you may not know about 1995's ""Toy Story"": . 1. It all goes back to a short called ""Tin Toy"" In 1988, Pixar created a short film using computer animation called ""Tin Toy,"" which told the story of a little toy soldier who was horrified by the babbling baby eager to play with him. With that Oscar-winning short, Pixar's John Lasseter first started playing with ""this notion of a juxtaposition with the audience,"" as Lasseter puts it in the documentary ""The Making of Toy Story."" ""It's where you can show them something that they are so familiar with, and all of a sudden you can make them look at something from a different point of view,"" he explains. ""Like, looking at a cute little baby from a toy's perspective. From a toy, that (baby's) a monster! We were inspired from 'Tin Toy' with the ideas we developed there of toys being alive."" Pixar then played around with the idea of the ""Tin Toy,"" Tinny, being one of two stars of a toy-focused buddy movie. But when the animation studio landed on the idea of the movie being set in a kid's bedroom, where one new toy would come to join the older ones, it didn't quite add up that a kid would be that excited about such a simple plaything. Enter Buzz Lightyear. 2. Buzz Lightyear was originally called ""Lunar Larry"" The action hero Buzz Lightyear is essentially a mashup of all of the Pixar team's favorite toys, and he was initially named ""Lunar Larry."" (The team also tried out something like ""Tempest from Morph."") Tim Allen also wasn't the only actor under consideration for the part. In 2001, Billy Crystal admitted that he too had been offered the role. ""It's the only regret I have in the business of something I passed on,"" Crystal said. As for Woody, brought to life by Tom Hanks, that was inspired by John Lasseter's Casper the Friendly Ghost toy, which also had that old-fashioned pull-string. 3. ""Toy Story"" wasn't supposed to be the movie's title . ""Toy Story"" was supposed to just be the working title for the project, and not what it was supposed to be called when it arrived in theaters. Back in 2011, ""Toy Story 3"" director Lee Unkrich turned to Twitter to reveal some of the options that were floating around back in the '90s. (Unkrich served as an editor on the first ""Toy Story."") Some of the options were pretty straightforward, titles like ""Made in Taiwan"" ""Moving Buddies"" and ""The Cowboy & The Spaceman."" And then there were some really creative ones, from ""Toyz in the Hood"" to ""Bring Me The Arm of Buzz Lightyear."" We're kind of a fan of the potential title ""To Infinity and Beyond,"" though. 4. The movie almost didn't happen . According to Entertainment Weekly, November 19, 1993 was a dark day for Pixar's creative team. That was when the studio presented a collection of story reels to Disney, whose animation chief was not at all into it. Among the complaints was that action figure astronaut Buzz Lightyear and quaint cowboy Woody were just unlikable and had awkward chemistry. (In the words of Joss Whedon, ""The original Woody was a thundering a******.'') To fix it, Pixar re-examined their two starring characters -- and listened more closely to the voices behind them. ""We originally thought Buzz was a heroic kind of super space hero Dudley Do-Right who always does the big gesture,"" said producer Ralph Guggenheim. ""But that was a setup for a big fall. We listened to Tim (Allen's) recordings and wound up with a self-confident but modest space cop, a Sgt. Joe Friday who does his job every day."" And for Hanks' Woody, who originally was supposed to be the top toy who reigned over the bedroom from the top of the bed, Pixar toned down some of the sarcasm and made him less of a dictator. ""When we moved him down to the floor with the other toys who looked up to him as Andy's favorite,"" Guggenheim said, ""he became one of the guys, more likable."" 5. The license plate number on Andy's mom's minivan has a special meaning . Several Pixar fans make it a game to watch for hidden messages in the company's films, and the sequence ""A113"" is one of them. According to Disney Insider, that was the room number for a class Pixar's John Lasseter, Brad Bird, Pete Docter and Andrew Stanton were all in at CalArts. You can spot that sequence on the license plate of the minivan driven by Andy's mom in ""Toy Story,"" ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Toy Story 3.""","The ""Toy Story 4"" announcement has thrilled fans .
But the original 1995 movie almost didn't happen .
Here are four other fun facts about the film ."
"(CNN) -- In parts of rural China, private health can be a very public affair. Crammed into shop front clinics on the main streets of many provincial towns, patients can be seen paying for routine treatment -- regular injections, intravenous drips or a consultation -- just by walking in off the street. The conditions are rudimentary -- often no more than rows of vinyl benches replete with drip stands. However, catching the spillover from China's overstrained public health system has become big business for pharmaceutical companies and healthcare corporations. While China is supposed to have comprehensive state-funded health cover, the stark reality is that many Chinese need medical insurance to make up the shortfall in the system. For many Chinese people, private savings for medical insurance is one of the reasons the country has one of the highest rates of personal savings in the world. For most, however, medical insurance is a contentious outlay. ""I don't think it really works for most ordinary Chinese people,"" 24-year-old Guangzhou-based student Xi Chen said. ""Last November, our father's hospital bill came to 6000RMB ($976) but we had to top it up the insurance 2300RMB of our own. ""The doctor told us we should have been thankful for our medical insurance or we would have had to pay more ... The truth is that government officers and hospitals benefit rather than ordinary people."" There's an app for that . It's in this space that medical assistance app Chunyu Yisheng hopes to carve out a niche. The app -- which this month raised $50 million in funding, the biggest single funding round into a Chinese healthcare startup to date -- connects users with physicians remotely to discuss and diagnose their ailments. The site already commands 30 million users who can connect with 40,000 doctors. It has set an ambitious target of gaining 100 million users by the end of 2015. ""We started in 2011, wanting to do something in the joint field of mobile internet and medicine,"" Chunyu chief technology officer Zeng Boyi said. ""We wanted to something of practical use that could actually help people. ""In China, it's very difficult for people to get an appointment with a doctor, so the idea of a medical app was quite a natural one,"" he said. Zeng said the startup is aimed at resolving minor ailments that often clog up hospital waiting rooms and aims to help people who may be at risk of misdiagnosing by reading up about their complaint on the internet. ""Some problems, mainly mild problems, are better solved online than others,"" Zeng says. ""People get safe, personalized, and professional advice from doctors on Chunyu -- we do not see Chunyu as a replacement for hospital. ""Besides a professional diagnosis, people often want to communicate -- they need to decrease their anxiety, know a bit more about their bodies and decide on the next move even before going to hospital. ""These sorts of problems are not easily solved in the hospital, but they are important to users. By reducing the cost of seeing a doctor, we activate a huge suppressed market."" He says the service acts as an adjunct to normal medical attention. ""We cannot diagnose serious diseases and doctors are careful in the advice they give. If users have serious symptoms -- if they're very sick -- their best choice is to go to a hospital. ""If a doctor is asked about serious symptoms, then the kind of advice we could give is the most suitable hospital to go to, the type of lab tests needed, and any other helpful advice."" Big potential . The startup is currently on a drive to recruit more doctors who not only earn money in their spare time but also gain a profile and a platform from the service. Of particular interest, says Zeng, are the data that will be generated by the online service. ""There's a lot of doctor/user communications that is logged on Chunyu every day. Those data are of particular importance because they are generated by real doctors whose only focus is solving the problem at hand -- they are not selling medication or promoting hospitals."" Chunyu's model is based on making the service free for both doctors and users, with its revenues raised through advertising from insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies and private hospitals. ""It's hard to estimate how much revenue would be generated by this service. By way of comparison, Baidu (one of China's largest online portals) makes one third of its revenues from the healthcare industry. ""We think it's a huge market.""

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Marine was being held Monday on a warship after the slaying of a transgender woman in the Philippines. Because no charges have yet been filed, officials have not identified the Marine, who is assigned to 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines, out of Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. ""The Marine Corps is working closely and cooperating fully with the Philippine National Police to ensure a thorough investigation is completed and due process of law is followed,"" Col.

"(CNN) -- Football's version of the fabled David vs. Goliath battle will begin on Tuesday as Europe's top club competition kicks off its quarterfinal stage. In one corner, modern-day giants Real Madrid -- one of the richest sporting teams in the world, with a squad featuring the planet's most expensive player, Cristiano Ronaldo. Seeking to find a suitable slingshot are the players of APOEL Nicosia, a tiny Cypriot club playing in the last eight of the UEFA Champions League for the first time -- indeed, being the first team from the Mediterranean island to even reach the knockout stage. The gulf in pedigree between the two teams is immense. Real, with revenue of more than â‚¬400 million ($530 million) last year, will seek to notch a record 200th win in the competition in the first leg in Nicosia. The Spanish league leaders last won the competition in 2002, but have an unmatched nine crowns since the first staging in 1955-56. APOEL have a yearly budget of â‚¬9 million ($12 million) and a squad featuring no big names, bolstered by several South Americans. Both teams have a Brazilian player named Kaka -- Real's is an $85 million former world player of the year, while APOEL's is a defender on loan from German club Hertha Berlin who also played for the club's Nicosia rivals Omonia in 2010. They have another thing in common, this time an Argentine link which further highlights the clubs' different worlds. Santiago Solari was a midfielder who enjoyed a glittering career which saw him win the Champions League with Real in 2002 and Spanish league titles in 2001 and 2003. But while Santiago played alongside ""Galacticos"" such as Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo and Brazilian World Cup winner Ronaldo, his younger brother Esteban Solari was beginning his career with Buenos Aires club Defensa y Justice. Santiago turned out for historic teams such as Argentina's River Plate and Italy's Inter Milan during 15 years as a player, but Esteban has enjoyed a more modest career. The 31-year-old has played for nine clubs across three continents, waiting patiently for the chance to step out of his sibling's shadow. ""I spoke to my brother and other members of my family after the draw,"" Esteban Solari told UEFA's official website. ""We spoke a bit about the history of the club (Real) and who they are. But that doesn't change my feelings about this tie with respects to my brother having played for them. ""I go into this game just like any other player in the team. We are confident and we believe in ourselves."" APOEL, who have played just 49 Champions League matches compared to Real's record total of 343, have already upset the odds to make it this far in the competition. Ivan Jovanovic's team finished top of a group which contained Russia's Zenit St. Petersburg, Portuguese champions Porto and Ukrainian title winners Shakhtar Donetsk -- three teams who have all tasted glory in the second-tier Europa League in the last four years. APOEL's unlikely run continued in the round of 16 with a dramatic penalty shootout victory over former French champions Lyon -- who had reached the knockout stages in each of the previous eight seasons. Esteban Solari hopes his brother would not begrudge APOEL a semifinal berth, where the minnows would face either 1993 winners Marseille of France or Germany's four-time European champions and 2012 final hosts Bayern Munich. ""My brother is obviously a big supporter of Real and he will be hoping that they can go on to lift the trophy,"" the striker said. ""But somehow, I believe there will be a piece of his heart rooting for my team as well."" Real will be motivated by the prospect of an ""El Clasico"" final against archrivals and Champions League holders Barcelona, after the two teams were kept apart in the quarterfinal and semifinal draw earlier this month. Barca, who beat Real in the semifinals last year before going on to defeat Manchester United in the final, face a heavyweight clash against Italy's seven-time winners AC Milan on Wednesday. Tuesday's other quarterfinal tie pits 2008 runners-up Chelsea -- who have enjoyed an upturn in domestic form since sacking manager Andre Villas-Boas earlier this month -- against Portugal's Benfica, who lifted the European Cup twice in the 1960s.","Spanish giants Real Madrid take on Cypriot minnows APOEL Nicosia on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Congressman Barney Frank is taking some major heat for making a serious accusation against Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Rep. Barney Frank cites a Supreme Court justice's legal opinions in calling him a homophobe. ""I do think this argument that it is unconstitutional for the federal government to pick and choose as to which marriages it will accept is a good one. At some point that's going to have to go to the United States Supreme Court,"" Frank told the Web site 365gay.com on Friday. ""I wouldn't want it to go to the United States Supreme Court now because that homophobe Antonin Scalia's got too many votes on this current court."" Frank, D-Massachusetts, explained his remark during an interview Wednesday with host John Roberts on CNN's ""American Morning."" John Roberts: Congressman Frank, you made a pretty pointed accusation there. What's the basis for that charge? Rep. Barney Frank: Two opinions written by Justice Scalia in which he makes it very clear that he thinks it's a terrible idea for people who are gay or lesbian to have equal rights. It's not based on his views on marriage. Obviously, there's a legitimate debate about marriage.  Watch Frank make his case against Scalia » . A few years ago, the state of Texas tried to send to prison two men who had private, consenting sex in their own bedroom. And the majority on the court said, ""That's unconstitutional. That's an invasion of privacy."" Justice (Clarence) Thomas said, ""Well, I think it's a silly law. I would have voted against it, but I don't think the Constitution prohibits it."" Justice Scalia wrote a long, angry dissent in which he made it very clear he thought it was a perfectly good law and that, in fact, homosexuals, as he refers to us, are bad people, and the notion that there ought to be any kind of legal protections is a mistake. In an earlier case in Colorado, in which he again vigorously denounced the majority in the court for finding that it was unconstitutional to discriminate against people, again, not in marriage but a basis of their political rights, he said, ""Well, of course, we disapprove this. We often disapprove of things like murder."" I mean, literally, when he was looking for comparisons to the public disapproval of homosexuality, the first thing he said was murder. So unlike many people who have different legitimate views on this, I urge people to read those two opinions in the Colorado case, the Romer case and the Lawrence case. And, again, there is just no question about his absolute view that ... homosexuals are bad people that shouldn't be treated equally. amFIX: React to Frank's comments on Scalia . Roberts: Well, let's take the Lawrence v. Texas case then, if we could. In his dissenting opinion he said, ""Today's opinion is the product of a court that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that is traditionally attached to homosexual conduct."" But what he was doing in that dissent, according to him, was complaining about judges, not elected officials, deciding questions about morality. Frank: No. Roberts: Scalia went on to write, ""It is clear from this that the court has taken sides in the culture war."" Frank: Yes. Roberts: So if he is talking here about -- he is upset that the court is deciding this as opposed to elected officials deciding it, how is that homophobic? Frank: Because ... you forgot to mention the issue here. It isn't whether or not homosexuality is a nice thing. It is whether two men in the privacy of their own bedroom, two men who live together, two adults, should be facing prison because they had intimate relations. Now, Justice Thomas said it's a silly law. Justice Scalia said, ""Oh, no, because we"" -- the phrase you quoted is in the context of justifying sending people to prison because they have consenting sex in private because he disapproves of homosexuality. The court wasn't taking sides in a culture war. The very way that he frames it is that. In other words, he believes that when six of his colleagues said, ""No, the Constitution protects privacy, and you do not allow people to go to jail for private, consenting sex,"" that that's taking sides in the culture war. So the very fact that he frames it that way is his argument. He is so angry about those of us who are maybe gay or lesbian that he thinks it takes sides in the culture war to say people shouldn't be imprisoned for private sexual acts. Roberts: And let me get to the point that you were making when you gave that interview, the Defense of Marriage Act. You say that it's going to come before the court at some point. The Defense of Marriage Act passed overwhelmingly in the House and the Senate. It was signed by a Democratic president. The National Review online, talking about what you said regarding Justice Scalia, pointed that out and went on to add, quote, ""Millions and millions of voters in state after state have acted to preserve traditional marriage. Does Congressman Frank regard all of these Americans as homophobes? Frank: No, as I just said -- no. I've already answered your question. No, I just differentiated between Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas. Justice Thomas said it's a silly law to send people to prison because of private, consenting sex. Scalia basically says ""Yes, that's where they belong."" So that's exactly the case. No, people have, as I said, legitimate rights to differ over the constitutionality of marriage. My point is that Scalia is so anti people who are homosexual that he will argue so vehemently there that I'd rather not have him have the influence. But I was talking about his attitude in cases which had to do with political rights in Colorado and sending people to prison. That's very different than the question about marriage. Roberts: And we should point out, too, that we reached out to Justice Scalia for comment. They declined comment on this, but perhaps we'll hear from him at some point down the line. Frank: Well, in fairness to Justice Scalia, I obviously was very critical of him. But Supreme Court justices are supposed to argue through their opinions. And that's why I'm not referring to any private comments he made but to his opinions. And, again, the issue in my mind is his vehement denunciation. Let's put it this way: He says it's taking sides in the culture war if you don't send people to jail for having private, consenting sex. It's got nothing to do with marriage.","Supreme Court justice's writings indicate personal bias, congressman says .
Scalia backed Texas sodomy law his fellow conservative called ""silly,"" Frank says .
Differences on gay marriage legitimate, Frank says, but sexual behavior is private ."
"(CNN) -- The first case of Ebola in the United States was diagnosed in Texas. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took to the airwaves to assure the public that there is no risk of widespread infection. The reason: The United States has a strong health system and trained health workers who can efficiently and effectively contain Ebola. This is good news for America, but what about the rest of the world? In fact, the devastation of Ebola highlights an urgent global crisis that, as we now see, can reach into the United States: Across the world, there is a shortage of 7.2 million health workers. The United States is sending thousands of troops to West Africa to fight Ebola. In Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal people suffer because Ebola death stalks faster than local governments and international relief agencies can respond. Our moral imperative to respond swiftly is obvious. Complete coverage on Ebola . This is made very difficult because at least 1 billion people have little to no access to a health worker, according to the World Health Organization. The Ebola epidemic has exposed global health's Achilles' heel. A big part of the reason is that the global health community has unwittingly built a system in which health advocates compete for funding allocated to specific diseases: HIV, malaria, tuberculosis -- the list goes on.","Ashley Judd, Karl Hofmann: Ebola is in Texas. U.S.' good health system is good news .
But event highlights bad news in rest of world: huge shortage of health workers globally, they say .

"(CNN) -- The results of an environmental impact study into the Keystone XL pipeline project will be announced Friday afternoon, two senior administration officials and another source familiar with the timing told CNN. The sources were not authorized to speak on the record. ""The (study) is in the final stages of preparation and we anticipate a release of the document soon,"" a State Department spokesperson told CNN. ""As a reminder when it is released, (the study) is not a decision, but another step in the process prescribed by the Executive Order"" from the President. What environmentalists and industry observers alike will be looking for is whether the study determines the project would be ""carbon neutral."" If it does, it's widely expected that the pipeline will ultimately win approval. Still, the process is far from over. Once the results of the study are out, eight U.S. agencies will then comb through it and offer their feedback. Secretary of State John Kerry will make a final recommendation to the White House. The president would then decide whether or not to approve the construction of the pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Supporters of the project, which would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day, say it would reduce imports from other more volatile areas and create jobs. But opponents warn against potential damage to the environment and question whether many long term jobs would be created. A final decision may not come for several months, but this study is a critical step in the process and the results are seen as a key factor in determining whether the project will go ahead.","President Obama will have the final say on the project .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Indians marched for peace, prayed and laid wreaths Friday in memory of the Mumbai terror attack as the nation's prime minister vowed renewed efforts to track down those behind the assault, which is blamed on Pakistan-based militants. ""We will never succumb to the designs of our enemies. We pledge to redouble our efforts to bring the perpetrators of this crime against humanity to justice,"" Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in a statement issued as the nation remembers the dead from the November 2008 siege of India's financial hub. The attack derailed the fragile peace process between nuclear-capable arch-foes India and Pakistan. Under U.S. pressure, the two neighbors resumed talks this year in a bid to restart a full dialogue, but progress has been slow. In the coordinated onslaught, 10 gunmen stormed three hotels, a train station and a Jewish cultural center in Mumbai, killing 164. On the second anniversary of the attacks, Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram paid homage to the police officers who died in the assault, including one killed tackling one of the militants. That militant, Mohammed Ajmal Kasab of Pakistan, is the only surviving gunman. He has been convicted of murder, conspiracy and waging war against India. His lawyers have appealed his death sentence to a higher court of Mumbai. ""On this day of remembrance, we salute the courage, unity and resolve of ordinary Mumbaikars and the brave and selfless actions of our men in uniform during the attack,"" Singh said in his statement. ""It is this spirit and strength of character of the Indian people that will defeat such forces that seek to threaten our social fabric and way of life."" Prithviraj Chavan, chief minister of Maharashtra state, of which Mumbai is the capital, also offered homage Friday at the city's Victoria Terminus railway station, one of the sites that came under attack. A peace march and a multi-faith prayer session were held at the seaside Gateway of India monument, said Chavan's spokesman, Satish Lalit. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent a message of solidarity Thursday to mark the assaults. ""As the people of the United States gather with family to celebrate Thanksgiving, we pause to remember the horrific attack on innocent men, women and children that occurred in Mumbai two years ago,"" her message said. ""Now, as then, the American people stand in solidarity with the people of India and honor those who lost their lives. ""President Obama's recent visit to India underscored our nations' shared belief in liberty, democracy and mutual respect for all people. As the people of Mumbai gather in temples, mosques, churches, gurdwaras and synagogues to honor those who perished on November 26, 2008, they send a message of resolve, resilience and mutual respect that is far louder and more powerful than any terrorist's guns and bombs."" The Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba has been blamed for the siege. The group has denied responsibility. Earlier this week, family members of two New Yorkers gunned down during the attacks said they are suing Pakistan's intelligence agency and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Relatives of Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg and his pregnant wife, Rivka, both of whom died in the siege, allege that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency aided the al Qaeda-allied militant group in the attacks. The wrongful death lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, says the intelligence agency ""provided critical planning, material support, control and coordination for the attacks."" The family members seek monetary damages, but did not specify an amount. Their lawyer, James Kreindler, was part of a successful lawsuit against Libya in connection with the 1988 explosion on Pan Am Flight 103. That blast killed 259 people over Lockerbie, Scotland, as well as 11 people on the ground. In January, more than a year after the attacks, the bodies of the nine slain Mumbai gunmen were buried in secret. Their bodies had been embalmed and kept in a hospital morgue because some Muslim groups refused to bury them in their graveyards, saying the attackers were not true followers of Islam. An Indian official in Maharashtra state revealed the burials months later. P.K. Jain, the state's principal home secretary, did not give the date or the exact location of what he described as a secret funeral.","Prime minister: ""We will never succumb to the designs of our enemies""

"Washington (CNN) -- Emerging from a closed meeting with the heads of foreign militaries, President Obama told reporters the effort to dismantle the terror group ISIS ""is going to be a long-term campaign. "" ""There will be days of progress and there are going to be periods of setback,"" he said, adding that an influx of fighters from outside the region joining ISIS makes it a threat beyond the Middle East and into the U.S. Defense chiefs from 22 nations fighting ISIS met all day at a secure facility to discuss the current military operations and ""the way ahead' according to a senior U.S. military official. The full coalition will be needed, according to Obama. ""We are going to have to pay attention to how all the countries in the region begin to cooperate in rooting out this cancer and we are going to have to continue on delivering the humanitarian assistance of all the populations that have been affected."" The meeting Tuesday was chaired by General Martin Dempsey, U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with General Lloyd Austin, commanding general of the U.S. Central Command which is largely running the operations in both Iraq and Syria. President Obama attended for a portion near the end of the day at Joint Base Andrews just outside Washington, DC. Iraqi military officials were expected to attend. Syrian opposition members were not invited because the meeting is for ""sovereign nations"" only, the official said. Classified discussions are expected to take place on the current operations. There was expected, however, to be some discussion of arming and training moderate Syrian opposition forces. ISIS militants march on despite airstrikes, international outrage . It was not expected that the coalition defense chiefs would discuss some significant change in strategy, the official said before the meetings got underway. ""This meeting is to share our vision, discuss coordination and our common understanding of the way ahead."" The defense chiefs are not policymakers, so any significant changes in the mission would require a decision by governments on a political level. This is the fourth such meeting of coalition partners, but the largest gathering to date. Similar meetings have been held in recent months in Jordan, Paris and Bonn. The military operation against ISIS now does have a name but the Pentagon is not expected to reveal it until later this week, a U.S. military official confirms to CNN. The name will not be made public until a formal 'execution order' covering the entire mission against ISIS is published by the Defense Department's Joint Staff perhaps as soon as Wednesday. Naming the operation is a fairly bureaucratic matter, but it is typically done in large scale or significant military operations as a means of providing a mechanism for everything from budgeting of funds to awarding of medals. The execution order will spell out these details, as well as potential command arrangements, and a formal military definition of the mission.

"(CNN) -- France has declared a three-day mourning period to commemorate the victims of the Air Algerie Flight 5017 crash, French President Francois Hollande declared on Saturday. Following a meeting with families of the victims, Hollande said flags will fly at half-staff on government buildings from Monday through Wednesday. Fifty-four of the 118 victims were French nationals. The second flight data recorder from has been found in Mali, a U.N. official said Saturday. A team from the U.N. mission to Mali, known as MINUSMA, is assisting the Malian authorities, at the request of that country's government, spokeswoman Radhia Achouri said. There were no survivors on the flight, which took off Thursday from Burkina Faso bound for Algeria. Accounts of the number of people on board continue to differ. Air Algerie says 117 passengers and six crew were on the plane, but France says there were 118 victims in total. The Algerian government said there were 116 passengers and six crew. The wreckage was found in what Hollande said was a ""disintegrated state"" in Mali's Gossi region, not far from the border with Burkina Faso. The first data recorder, or black box, was found at the crash site on Friday. The cause of the crash is not yet confirmed, but weather may have been a factor. Less than an hour into the flight, the aircraft, an MD-83, disappeared from radar after changing its flight path because of bad weather, officials said. The U.N. mission's support includes logistics, transportation, technical and scientific expertise, as well as help securing the crash site, which is in a remote and inaccessible location. ""Our experts assists the Malians and the French in the search of the site, collecting bodies, providing body bags and in securing the site aiming to speed up the work,"" said Achouri. As part of French efforts to assist, 33 French forensic experts arrived at the crash site Saturday. How flight attendants keep flying after air disasters . World unrest raises travel tension .

"London (CNN) -- One of the perennial criticisms of Eurovision is that, for a song contest, the compositions are seldom very memorable. But for the millions who tune in each year, drawn to the promise of outrageous outfits and performances, the contest is as much about spectacle as it is about the music. For diehard fans, what an artist wears can be a bigger talking point than what they sing. The more misguided an outfit, the better. In 1997, fan website House of Eurovision founded the ""Barbara Dex Awards,"" an annual prize for the worst dressed artist. The award was named after a Belgian singer who appeared in the 1993 competition wearing an unflattering homemade dress. Melodifestivalen: Sweden's not-so-guilty Eurovision pleasure . ""Her song wasn't at all bad, but her performance was overshadowed by that awful self-made dress, and as a result she ended up last,"" said Edwin van Thillo, who runs the fan site. Attention-grabbing outfits have always been part of Eurovision's DNA. Germany's 1958 entry Margot Hielscher performed wearing a sash saying ""Miss Jukebox,"" and brandishing vinyl records at the audience. But the past 15 years have seen the costumes reach new heights of flamboyance. ""Visuals have become so much more important since televoting was introduced in 1998,"" said Sam Broderick, a writer for ESC Nation, one of the most popular Eurovision fan websites. ""Acts only have three minutes to get their song heard and their message across, and they have to compete against 25 other songs to be remembered,"" he said. ""I think that's why so many acts have gimmicks on stage -- and an outrageous costume is just another gimmick. It's all part of the glitz and the glamor of the contest too, and I think that's why people love Eurovision."" But dressing up as a bird, butterfly or robot doesn't guarantee success. Many of the acts featured in our gallery finished near the bottom of the table, or failed to progress past the semi-finals. ""A terrible outfit can destroy any chances a song may have had,"" said Broderick. ""I remember watching rehearsals in Oslo in 2010 when the Maltese entrant Thea Garrett came on stage with her backing dancer dressed as a massive bird. The whole press center was in howls of laughter,"" he said. ""It was quite highly regarded before then, but I really think that big bird put paid to the song's chances.""","Eurovision outfits have become more flamboyant since the advent of televoting .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is traveling to Israel on Monday as part of the latest effort to forge a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Kerry is flying from Paris -- where he had discussed the Ukraine crisis with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov over the weekend -- into Tel Aviv, with possible meetings in Jerusalem and Ramallah over the next day, a senior State Department official said. Kerry tried to restart the Israeli-Palestinian peace process eight months ago, aiming to get a deal leading to the two states coexisting peacefully. So far, the process has included a series of meetings along with incremental steps intended to build trust, such as prisoner releases. However, Kerry's initial goal of an agreement by the end of April has morphed into a possible framework for further talks through the end of 2014. Psaki said Kerry decided it would be productive to return to the region this week after consulting with a U.S. team that is negotiating with the Israelis and the Palestinians to end their decades-long conflict. ""Over the course of the last eight months, the Israelis and Palestinians have both made tough choices, and as we work with them to determine the next steps, it is important they remember that only peace will bring the Israeli and Palestinian people both the security and economic prosperity they all deserve,"" Psaki said. Kerry's trip comes after President Barack Obama hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for separate White House talks earlier this month. While both sides have signaled agreement with the concept of a two-state solution, in which Israel and an independent Palestinian nation would live side by side, they remain at odds over how to make that happen. Areas of disagreement include borders, security issues, the status of Jerusalem, and the rights of Palestinians who left or fled their homes in what is now Israel.

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that a cross displayed on public property for nearly a century is unconstitutional. Three versions of the Christian symbol have been erected atop 822-foot Mount Soledad in the posh La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, since 1913. The current 43-foot cross was erected in 1954 in honor of Korean War veterans and has been the subject of near constant judicial back and forth since 1989, when two Vietnam War veterans filed suit against the city, saying it violated the California Constitution's ""No Preference"" clause. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the notion that the cross -- since the late 1990s surrounded by plaques and paving stones honoring veterans and war dead -- was solely a memorial. ""The use of such a distinctively Christian symbol to honor all veterans sends a strong message of endorsement and exclusion,"" the court said in its ruling. ""It suggests that the government is so connected to a particular religion that it treats that religion's symbolism as its own, as universal. To many non-Christian veterans, this claim of universality is alienating."" The court also noted that the site had, for most of history, been used for Easter services -- marked on maps until the late 1980s as the ""Mount Soledad Easter Cross"" -- and was designated a war memorial with a plaque ""only after the legal controversy began in the late 1980s."" ""It was not until the late 1990s that veterans' organizations began holding regular memorial services at the site,"" the court said. And the court rejected arguments that the cross at a war memorial was no different than any other memorial that includes a cross. ""This war memorial -- with its imposing Cross -- stands as an outlier among war memorials, even those incorporating crosses,"" the ruling says. ""Contrary to any popular notion, war memorials in the United States have not traditionally included or centered on the cross and, according to the parties' evidence, there is no comparable memorial on public land in which the cross holds such a pivotal and imposing stature, dwarfing by every measure the secular plaques and other symbols commemorating veterans."" The ruling will almost certainly be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Since the first lawsuit in 1989, the city of San Diego twice tried selling the property beneath the cross to the Mount Soledad Memorial Association, only to be stopped by the courts: once for failing to solicit bids and once for violating California's ""No Preference"" clause for giving ""substantial financial advantage to bidders"" who intended to leave the cross in place. By the late 1990s, with the association maintaining the property, the cross became a more extensive war memorial, with stone plaques and paving stones honoring veterans and other accoutrements of a memorial. In 2004, the city, the plaintiffs and the association reached an agreement that would move the cross to a nearby church, but two Republican congressmen intervened and inserted a rider into the 2005 omnibus budget bill that designated the property as a national veterans memorial and authorized the federal government to accept the donation of the property. But the San Diego City Council refused to donate the property after the city attorney wrote that the transfer likely would violate both the federal and state constitutions. Facing pressure from a new association formed to ""save the Mount Soledad cross,"" the city reversed its decision and instead put the matter to a vote, which passed handily. More court filings followed, and in June 2006, three Republican congressmen pushed through a bill calling for the government to seize the property by eminent domain -- calling it ""a historically significant war memorial."" The federal government took possession in August. Two lawsuits were filed challenging the transfer almost immediately: one by Steve Trunk and Philip Paulson and the other by Jewish War Veterans of the United States. The district court consolidated the cases and eventually ruled in favor of the government. Trunk, Paulson and the Jewish War Veterans appealed, leading to Friday's ruling.","A cross has been atop San Diego's Mount Soledad since 1913 .

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- The Brazilian air force said that debris picked up Thursday near where officials believe Air France Flight 447 crashed Monday into the Atlantic Ocean was not from the plane. Image released by the Brazilian Air Force shows oil slicks in the water near a debris site. ""It has been verified that the material did not belong to the plane,"" Brigadier Ramon Borges Cardoso told reporters in Recife about the material recovered Thursday. ""It is a pallet of wood that is utilized for transport. It is used in planes, but on this flight to Paris, there was no wooden pallet."" He added that oil slicks seen on the ocean were not from the plane, either, and that the quantity of oil exceeded the amount the plane would have carried. ""No material from the airplane was picked up,"" he said. The announcement left open the question of whether other debris that had not yet been plucked from the ocean might be from the plane. On Wednesday, searchers recovered two debris fields and had identified the wreckage, including an airplane seat and an orange float as coming from Flight 447. Officials now say that none of the debris recovered is from the missing plane. Helicopters had been lifting pieces from the water and dropping them on three naval vessels. Brazilian Air Force planes spotted an oil slick and four debris fields Wednesday but rain and rough seas had kept searchers from plucking any of the debris from the water. Officials said searchers had found objects in a circular 5-kilometer (3-mile) area, including one object with a diameter of 7 meters (23 feet) and 10 other objects, some of which were metallic, Brazilian Air Force spokesman Jorge Amaral said. The debris was found about 650 kilometers (400 miles) northeast of the Fernando de Noronha Islands, an archipelago 355 kilometers off the northeast coast of Brazil. Eleven aircraft and five ships are engaged in the search, including airplanes from France and the United States. Earlier Thursday, a public interfaith service was held for the 228 victims at a 200-year-old Catholic Church in downtown Rio. Joining family members were members of the Brazilian armed forces, who are leading the recovery effort. ""Whoever has faith, whoever believes in God, believes in the eternity of the soul,"" said Mauro Chavez, whose friend lost a daughter on the flight. ""This means everything."" Investigators have not yet determined what caused the plane to crash. The flight data recorders have not been recovered, and the plane's crew did not send any messages indicating problems before the plane disappeared. A Spanish pilot said he saw an ""intense flash"" in the area where Flight 447 came down off the coast of Brazil, while a Brazilian minister appeared to rule out a midair explosion. Meanwhile, a report in France suggested the pilots were perhaps flying at the ""wrong speed"" for the violent thunderstorm they flew into early on Monday before the Airbus A330's systems failed. Le Monde newspaper reported that Airbus was sending a warning to operators of A330 jets with new advice on flying in storms. As several ships trawled the debris site in the Atlantic, Brazil's defense minister said a 20-kilometer (12-mile) oil slick near where the plane, en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, went down indicated it probably did not break up until it hit the water. If true, that would rule out an in-flight explosion as the cause of the crash of Air France Flight 447, Defense Minister Nelson Jobim told reporters. However, both pilots of an Air Comet flight from Lima, Peru, to Lisbon, Portugal, sent a written report on the bright flash they said they saw to Air France, Airbus and the Spanish civil aviation authority, the airline told CNN. ""Suddenly, we saw in the distance a strong and intense flash of white light, which followed a descending and vertical trajectory and which broke up in six seconds,"" the captain wrote. Air Comet declined to identify the pilot's name but said he waited until landing to inform Air Comet management about what he saw. Air Comet then informed Spanish civil aviation authorities. The Air Comet co-pilot and a passenger aboard the same flight also saw the light. But Robert Francis, former vice chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, said the question of determining where a plane broke up ""is a very difficult one to deal with."" He told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that ""there are lots of things that cause a plane to go out of control."" He added that extremely strong winds are not unusual near Brazil. Pilots who fly over that part of the world keep track of radar and ""are very, very wary about the weather as they go back and forth down in that area."" Jobim said currents had strewn the debris widely and that the search area had been expanded to 300 square miles.  Watch report on the struggle to find pieces of the plane » .

Some investigators have noted that the plane flew through a severe lightning storm. Foul play has not been ruled out.

"Washington (CNN) -- Staff Sgt. Salvatore Giunta, the first living Medal of Honor recipient since the Vietnam War, is a new dad. The Army soldier's mother told CNN Monday that Giunta, who has left the active-duty Army and begun studies in college, is the father of a baby girl. Giunta married his wife Jennifer in 2009. Giunta's mother, Rosemary, said the baby and mother are doing fine. The girl was born last week, but the new grandmother said Giunta is keeping details like the baby's name and exact birth date private. As the daughter of a Medal of Honor recipient, baby Giunta will get a few benefits herself. She and the rest of her family will get special identification cards and commissary and exchange privileges. The latter affords them access to lower-cost shopping, as well as recreation facilities like pools and bowling allies. And if she qualifies, baby Giunta will be eligible for admission to a United States military academy, without having first to be nominated or adhere to quota retirements. Giunta was awarded the Medal of Honor in November for his deeds in a battle with the Taliban in Afghanistan in October 2007. He continued fighting, and rescued a team leader, despite being hit twice by bullets -- one striking his armored vest and another that hit a weapon on his back. Neither caused serious injuries, and Giunta went back to work with his unit moments after the attack ended. After having served two tours in Afghanistan over seven years, Giunta announced plans in February to leave the U.S. Army and move to Fort Collins, Colorado, with his wife, Lt. Col. Greg Hapgood of the Iowa National Guard said then.","Staff Sgt. Salvatore Giunta earned the Medal of Honor in November 2010 .

"(CNN) -- A mother and her young son were at a mall, when she considered buying him a sandwich. She knew her husband would beat her later for spending the $7, but her son was hungry. She swallowed her fear and bought the sandwich. I met a college professor with a PhD who told me that her husband took her paycheck every month and that she had to wear long sleeves in the summer to hide the bruises on her arms. When a person tells you these very personal, gut-wrenching stories, you can't help but be moved to act. Still, many people hear these stories and they ask, ""Why does she stay?"" I've learned that getting away is never easy. There are children to consider. Emotional ties are hard to break. Oftentimes women simply don't have the money because money is a weapon of choice for many domestic violence perpetrators. The National Network to End Domestic Violence reports that financial abuse almost always accompanies physical abuse and can be the primary obstacle to women breaking free from bondage. It works like this: A man (women are the victims in 85% of cases) sets up a credit card in the woman's name and doesn't pay the bills, ruining the woman's credit. The man forces the woman to put her paycheck into a bank account and won't give her access. He hides all financial documents and won't share passwords for websites. So, the woman often has no money, poor credit, and a limited understanding of her financial situation. Even if she is desperate to leave an abusive partner and has the courage to move to a local domestic violence shelter, she has no money for transportation, food or clothing. So, the right question isn't: ""Why does she stay?"" The right question is: ""How can we help her get safe and secure?"" Evidence shows that arming victims with the right tools and information can help. Victims need to protect and reclaim their financial resources, rebuild their credit and gain a complete understanding of their financial picture. According to a long-term study by The Center for Violence Against Women and Children at Rutgers University, abused women who participated in a financial education curriculum developed by The Allstate Foundation and the National Network to End Domestic Violence were twice as likely to take the financial steps necessary to rebuild their lives. The sheer scope of domestic violence overall in this country almost defies belief. Data from the Centers for Disease Control shows that one in four women will be a victim of domestic abuse in their lifetime. The CDC also reports that 2 million women are injured in the U.S. every year and that domestic abuse leads to 8 million lost days of work annually. Polling by the Allstate Foundation has shown that almost three quarters of us know a victim, even though few of us realize it. The U.S. Department of Justice has stated that approximately 1,300 die annually from domestic violence. The United States Conference of Mayors argues that it is the No. 1 cause of homelessness for women, and the violence scars millions of children each year who witness it. Yet, few want to talk about it because it is a dark and ugly subject. The NFL has given us all an opportunity to have deeper conversations about domestic violence. But it shouldn't take a high-profile incident in the news for us to rise up and take a stand against domestic violence. We must seize the opportunity to bring domestic violence and financial abuse out of the shadows and help women trapped in abusive relationships find the path to safety. Business needs to take domestic violence very seriously. We need more businesses to step up and play an active role in protecting women. Wherever possible, businesses should take into account extenuating circumstances such as domestic violence when considering credit histories and ratings. Companies should make sure employee benefit plans provide a helping hand when needed. Managers should be trained on how best to identify and support employees who are victims of abuse at home. In addition, all of us can rise up, including role models in sports and entertainment, academia, educators and concerned citizens. Only by pulling back the curtain and getting involved can we ensure that victims can escape to a safer and brighter future.

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Bill Cassidy, the Republican congressman running for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana, is taking heat from the left and the right after he said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ""runs the Senate like a plantation."" Reid, asked Tuesday by reporters about the comment, demanded an apology. ""With all the things going on in America today, that's fairly insensitive,"" Reid told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""That's really insensitive. Very insensitive. If there was ever a statement that deserves an apology, this is it big time. Has he been taking lessons from Donald Sterling? Where did he get this?"" Cassidy made the comments during an interview with an energy trade publication. He was trying to make the point that it doesn't matter whether Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu bucks her party on energy issues because Reid calls the shots. Landrieu has told voters she'll stand up to her party and the president on energy issues. Senate Democrats' campaign arm immediately tried to capitalize, firing off several emails to supporters about Cassidy's comments. His challenger on the right, retired Air Force Col. Rob Maness jumped on his opponent's remarks shortly after they appeared on Tuesday in Energy and Environment Daily. ""Congressman Cassidy may not realize this but the language he used included a term that is incredibly offensive to many Americans and he should immediately apologize,"" Maness said in a statement. ""It's this type of over-the-top, out-of-bounds ignorance that drives so many people away from the Republican Party. We need to be better than that."" Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Justin Barasky piled on more criticism and called Cassidy's comments ""incredibly offensive."" ""Bill Cassidy's assertion that the Senate is run like a plantation and that as a congressman he doesn't want to be kicked around like a slave is incredibly offensive and he should apologize,"" Barasky said. But Cassidy showed no signs of apologizing and slammed that interpretation of his remarks as ""false controversy."" ""I wish there was as much offense taken by Harry Reid running the Senate dictatorially, not allowing any votes which he does not personally approve of and the result of which he does not endorse,"" Cassidy said in a statement to the Washington Post. Cassidy, Maness and Landrieu will face off for the Louisiana Senate seat Nov. 4 in an open primary election. It should be noted that Cassidy is not the first, nor the most prominent, politician to use the plantation analogy to characterize congressional leadership. Then-Sen. Hillary Clinton charged Republican leaders in 2006 of running the House ""like a plantation"" during a speech in front of a largely black audience at a Harlem church. Like Cassidy, a Clinton spokesman also defended her remarks. And then Rep.-Newt Gingrich also called out Democrats with the same analogy in 1994 shorty before become House Speaker, saying Democrats ""think it's their job to run the plantation"" and that he's ""willing to lead the slave rebellion."" But Cassidy's tea party-backed challenger Maness is still calling for an apology. ""We all make mistakes and when we do, we should have the fortitude to own up to them,"" Maness said. 5 key races to watch for midterm elections .","Senate candidate Bill Cassidy criticizes Harry Reid for running ""the Senate like a plantation.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Key Republicans on Capitol Hill blasted the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve on Wednesday for orchestrating an $85 billion bailout of insurance giant American International Group, and the White House for not informing them of the plan. Some lawmakers complained Wednesday they didn't know a bailout of AIG was in the works. Meanwhile, Democrats blamed the Bush administration for the financial crisis, while the White House pointed a finger at Congress. The criticism came a day after lawmakers were surprised by the news that taxpayers would again be called on to shore up a member of the struggling financial sector. ""Once again the Fed has put the taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars to bail out an institution that put greed ahead of responsibility and used their good name to take risky bets that did not pay off,"" said Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Kentucky, a member of the Senate Banking Committee. A spokesman for Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on the committee, said the senator ""profoundly disagrees with the decision to use taxpayer dollars to bail out a private company"" and is upset the government has sent an inconsistent message to the markets by bailing out AIG after it just refused to save investment bank Lehman Brothers from bankruptcy. ""The American taxpayer should not be asked to unwillingly assume the inordinate risks that financial experts knowingly undertook, particularly when taxpayer exposure is increased by the ad hoc manner in which these bailouts have been engineered,"" said Shelby's aide, Jonathan Graffeo.  Watch how bailout affects taxpayers » . Republican Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri complained about not getting a heads-up about the bailout and said House Republicans are struggling to ""understand a coherent strategy"" about which firms get rescued and which ones don't. Rep. Adam Putman of Florida, the third-ranking Republican in the House, said the cost is ""unnerving"" and called on the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve ""to dispatch an envoy to the Hill to bring members of Congress up to speed."" ""The communications lines are not operating efficiently,"" he said. Late Wednesday, the White House agreed to send a top Bush economic adviser and an official from the Fed to brief House Republicans on Thursday, according to a House GOP aide. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats placed the blame for the crisis squarely on the Bush administration, arguing it failed to aggressively regulate the financial industry. ""The most recent bailout initiated by the Bush administration -- that of AIG -- is just another example that George Bush is a failed manager,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California. ""Because of the inattention, or a decision on their part to have crony capitalism in our country, Americans across the country are feeling the pain of this."" Pelosi said two House committees would investigate the recent bailouts ""to tell us how we can avoid this in the future, what went wrong here and also to look into this issue of fraud and mismanagement"" at AIG. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Congress could have done more to head off the crisis. ""I think that Congress needs to take -- before they start throwing arrows -- take a little bit of time for some self-reflection,"" she said. ""But also, why don't we just set that aside for a minute and focus on the fact that we have a crisis that we're trying to manage."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- who also complained that he didn't know a bailout of AIG was in the works -- said Congress won't change laws immediately to address the rapidly unfolding financial crisis because ""no one knows what to do."" ""We are in new territory here,"" Reid added. ""You could ask [Federal Reserve Chairman Ben] Bernanke, you could ask [Treasury Secretary Henry] Paulson. They don't know what to do, but they are trying to come up with ideas."" Reid said he will keep the Senate in session through the end of the year so committees can hold hearings and start writing legislation that he said could become law next year. ""It's a multitrillion-dollar issue that's facing America, and we can't do it in some timeline that is unrealistic,"" Reid said. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama on Thursday said the bailout plan must ""protect the families that count on insurance"" from AIG. He also said the Federal Reserve should make sure the bailout plan protects well-paying jobs and helps Americans pay their bills. At a town hall meeting in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Republican candidates Sen. John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin both called for reforming the financial markets ""in Wall Street and Washington,"" as McCain put it. ""We're going to reform how Wall Street does business and put an end to the greed that has driven our markets into chaos,"" McCain said. ""We'll put an end to multimillion-dollar payouts to CEOs who have broken the public trust. We'll put an end to running Wall Street like a casino. We'll make businesses work for the benefit of their shareholders and employees, and we'll make sure your savings -- IRA, 401(k) and pension accounts -- are protected.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked a Democratic measure championed by President Barack Obama to end tax breaks for the major oil companies. The procedural vote of 51-47, which failed to reach the needed threshold of 60 in favor, killed the measure, which was given little chance of eventually winning approval in the Republican-controlled House. Four Democrats opposed the bill while one Republican supported it. Obama and Democrats had pushed it in an attempt to gain political advantage as rising gas prices continue to hurt and anger American voters in an election year. In remarks shortly before the Senate voted, Obama said the nation will be watching to see where Congress stands on the issue. ""With record profits and rising production, I'm not worried about the big oil companies,"" Obama said in the White House Rose Garden. ""... I think it's time they got by without more help from taxpayers, who are having a tough enough time paying their bills and filling up their tanks."" After the vote, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney labeled the result ""unfortunate."" Poll: Americans increasingly worried about gas prices . A CNN/ORC International poll (PDF) released Thursday shows a majority of Americans blame oil companies -- rather than the Obama administration -- for the high gas prices. According to the survey, conducted last weekend, seven in 10 Americans say rising gas prices have caused hardship for them and their families. Obama's energy policy, which emphasizes investment in alternative sources, has repeatedly been attacked by Republicans as contributing to high gas prices and stunting domestic oil development. The president has targeted the roughly $2 billion a year in tax breaks and subsidies for oil companies as a potential new revenue source for clean energy development. In his remarks Thursday, Obama emphasized steps his administration has taken to boost domestic oil and natural gas production, seeking to deflect the GOP criticism. He said that now is the time to choose whether to continue to give unneeded subsidies to a thriving industry or to make critical investments in other energy sources. ""Instead of taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's never been more profitable, we should be using that money to double down on investments in clean energy technologies that have never been more promising,"" Obama said. ""Investments in wind power and solar power and biofuels; in fuel-efficient cars and trucks and homes and buildings. That's the future. That's the only way we'll break this cycle of high gas prices that happens year after year after year as the economy is growing."" To end his statement, Obama declared his belief in the nation's ability to rise to any challenge and become the leader of a new global energy industry in the coming century. He framed the oil subsidy vote as a choice between that vision and protecting the status quo, adding: ""Today, the American people are going to be watching Congress to see if they have that same faith."" Obama defends his policy on oil pipeline . The Democratic-sponsored Senate measure -- which was opposed by most conservatives -- would have repealed subsidies currently benefiting BP, Exxon, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips. Savings would have been used to renew various alternative clean energy initiatives and reduce the deficit. Democrats sought to cast Republicans as defenders of unpopular big oil companies, while Republicans highlighted rising pump prices on Obama's watch. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, complained Thursday morning that the upcoming vote amounted to political theater because everyone, including the sponsors, knew it would have no effect on gas prices. ""Day after day after day, Democrats ask us all to come out here, not so we can make an actual difference in the lives of working Americans and families struggling to fill the gas tank, but so we can watch them stage votes for show,"" McConnell said. ""For some reason, they thought they could put political points on the board if the American people saw them voting for a tax hike that we all knew ahead of time didn't have the votes to pass."" His Democratic counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, opened debate on the oil subsidy measure Monday by noting that big oil companies are ""making money hand over fist."" ""If Republicans continue to stand up for oil companies making record profits, one thing will be obvious: Republicans care less about bringing down gas prices than about helping big oil companies that don't need the help,"" Reid said. He insisted that repealing ""wasteful subsidies"" wouldn't lead to a hike in oil and gas prices -- an assertion dismissed by Republicans. Energy secretary hammered on gas prices . Democrats have proposed ""raising taxes on American energy manufacturers -- something common sense and basic economics tell us will lead to even higher prices at the pump,"" McConnell said Wednesday. ""Frankly, I can't think of a better way to illustrate how completely out of touch they are on this issue."" Democrats have repeatedly raised the issue of whether it is appropriate to provide tax subsidies for highly profitable oil and gas companies. Legislation similar to the current bill was narrowly rejected by the Senate last May. Among other things, the measure killed on Thursday would have ended oil production's categorization under the tax code as a form of domestic manufacturing eligible for a deduction worth 6% of net income, according to New Jersey Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez, the bill's author. The measure also would have prevented oil companies from claiming foreign royalty payments as a credit against American taxes, and cut the ability of companies to deduct numerous costs associated with the drilling process. ""With oil prices over $100 per barrel, Big Oil does not need a taxpayer incentive to explore,"" Menendez's office asserted in a written statement. Brian Johnson, a senior tax adviser at the American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil interests in Washington, told CNN the bill unfairly targeted one industry. Among other things, he noted that many industries currently qualify for the domestic manufacturing deduction at a higher rate of 9%. ""How is this a legitimate tax deduction for Starbucks or The New York Times at 9% and somehow it's a 'subsidy' for the oil and natural gas industry at a lesser 6%? The answer is it's not,"" he said. ""We're already penalized."" Repealing the royalty payment credit would be tantamount to double taxation and could cripple American-based operations, he argued. ""Raising taxes will not lower energy prices for American families and business,"" the American Petroleum Institute's president, Jack Gerard, said in a written statement. ""It's time to work together on a national energy strategy that focuses on developing all American energy resources."" In the short term, bills such as the one blocked on Thursday are unlikely to affect gas prices or change the market enough to shift voter attitudes, argued Joseph Stanislaw, founder of J.A. Stanislaw Group, an energy and investment advisory firm. ""The global oil market has more impact on the presidential election than the president has on the global oil market,"" Stanislaw said.","NEW: The White House spokesman calls the Senate vote ""unfortunate""

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson called an incident in which a man scaled a fence and entered the White House ""unacceptable"" and told a congressional committee Tuesday that she takes ""full responsibility."" Omar Gonzalez, a 42-year-old knife-wielding Iraq war veteran, entered an unlocked door to the executive mansion, Pierson told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which grilled her on the September 19 security breach. A federal grand jury on Tuesday indicted Gonzalez on three separate federal and District of Columbia charges that could carry a maximum of 17 years in prison. His first court appearance is expected Wednesday in Washington. The White House door through which Gonazlez barged had no remote locking mechanism and needed to be manually locked, Pierson told lawmakers, adding that such a mechanism has since been installed. ""It's clear that our security plan was not properly executed,"" she said. ""I take full responsibility. What happened is unacceptable, and it will never happen again."" Saying she couldn't give complete responses because presidential protection is highly sensitive or classified, Pierson said the incident remains under investigation, and she doesn't ""want to get ahead of the investigation."" It didn't come up at the hearing, but the Washington Post reported that the officer who tackled Gonzalez wasn't even on duty but was leaving a shift protecting the president's daughters. Republicans and Democrats questioned how Gonzalez penetrated ""five rings of security"" in jumping the White House fence, overpowering a Secret Service officer and running deep into the White House, where he was finally subdued. ""How on earth did this happen?"" asked Chairman Darrell Issa. ""Why was there no guard stationed at the front door of the White House, and yes, how much would it cost to lock the front door of the White House?"" Added Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the panel, ""I hate to even imagine what could have happened if Gonzalez had been carrying a gun instead of a knife when he burst inside the White House. That possibility is extremely unsettling."" Can the Secret Service actually change? Rep. Jason Chaffetz asked whether officers who caught Gonzalez acted appropriately by not using lethal force. Pierson said the Secret Service agents ""did use restraint in making a very difficult decision"" but conceded that she didn't believe the security plan was properly executed, which is why the incident is being reviewed. The Secret Service should take a more aggressive posture, not a restrained one, Chaffetz said, and if agents kill someone who has breached White House security, ""I will have their back."" Former Secret Service Director Ralph Basham later said that neither he nor the American public wants the Secret Service's first reaction at seeing someone invade the White House lawn to be: kill that person. But after 3Â½ hours, it was clear that the committee wasn't confident in the agency's own review. Issa concluded the hearing by saying he and Cummings agreed that ""an internal investigation by the secret service is not sufficient"" and said they plan to formally request an independent inquiry. Another security lapse . Meanwhile, in another incident involving a violation of security protocol, an armed security contractor was allowed on an elevator with President Barack Obama during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on September 16, according to a whistleblower. This whistleblower spoke to Chaffetz's office, and the incident was confirmed by a Secret Service official. Chaffetz tweeted on Tuesday evening, ""security contractor with a gun next to the President happened two weeks ago, according to my whistleblower."" The security worker was acting strangely and had his phone out while on the elevator with the President, according to Chaffetz's office. When the security worker was confronted about his behavior, it was revealed that he was armed. The incident was first reported by the Washington Examiner and was followed up with additional reporting by the Washington Post. The Post reported that the Secret Service was not aware he was armed until after the worker was confronted. Pierson's future in question . At the end of the public session of the congresssional hearing, Cummings said ""the jury is still out"" on whether Pierson can stay on in and fix the problems at the agency. Asked about his confidence in the director's ability to continue in her post, Issa told reporters, ""This hearing did not add to my confidence."" Over and over, Democrats and Republicans sharply criticized the Secret Service director's leadership and expressed disbelief that no one at the agency had been held accountable. Pierson noted she has been on the job for 18 months and took steps to reform the agency but also said, ""when you bring change into an organization, there is pushback."" But Pierson's testimony only appeared to further inflame some members of the committee. ""I wish to God you had protected the White House like you are protecting your reputation,"" said a scolding Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Massachusetts. Holding up a sign featuring the blue ADT security logo, Rep John Mica, R-Florida, asked Pierson, ""have you ever heard of these guys?"" White House fence jumpers . Pierson told the committee that people jump the White House fence a few times a year. ""The Secret Service has apprehended 16 individuals who have jumped the fence over the last five years, including six this year alone. In fact, on September 11, 2014, a week prior to the events that are the subject of today's hearing, officers apprehended an individual seconds after he scaled the fence and ran onto the grounds,"" she said. Sitting beside Pierson, Basham said the ""unprecedented and unacceptable"" breach poses difficult questions about the use of lethal force and the tolerance for additional fortifications around the executive mansion. There are no easy answers, and long-term consequences of any changes must be thought through, he told the committee. Last week, a law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said that prior to the intrusion, Secret Service agents interviewed Gonzalez twice before determining both times that they didn't have enough reason to keep him. Pierson confirmed reports raised by a committee member that two Secret Service agents saw Gonzalez near the White House fence on September 19, prior to the breach, and ""observed him for some time."" Ultimately, Pierson said, the agents determined that Gonzalez wasn't acting inappropriately or violating any laws. Opinion: Do we want a fortress White House? Later, referring to the Secret Service's contacts with Gonzalez before the September 19 breach, she said there's not a lot that the service can do to manage ""people with mental illness who do not commit a crime."" The Secret Service has said Gonzalez has acknowledged having post-traumatic stress disorder. ""We're limited by the system we have to work within: the laws of our country,"" Pierson said. Incidents strain public trust . The Gonzalez breach and other ""misbehaviors"" and security failures by the Secret Service have ""tested the trust of the American people"" and blemished the Secret Service record, Issa said. The California Republican cited several examples of misbehavior, including a reality TV subject crashing a state dinner, a 2012 prostitution scandal, an agent falling asleep outside a room in the Netherlands and gunshots fired at the White House in November 2011, an incident in which damage wasn't properly reported. Committee members pointed out that in regard to the 2011 incident, The Washington Post reported a Secret Service employee was told to stand down after hearing gunshots near the White House and then felt unable the next day to contradict her superiors' false belief that the White House wasn't shot at. Cummings called the report a ""major problem,"" and Pierson said the contention that the officer did not challenge her supervisors for fear of being criticized is a concern. ""It's unacceptable,"" she said. Answering another question from Issa about why damage to the White House wasn't initially detected but rather found days later, Pierson defended her agency's response and said records show that the Secret Service ""did respond properly"" by sweeping the area to see whether anyone was injured and whether there were obvious signs of damage. Rep. Trey Gowdy and Pierson had a contentious exchange over why the Secret Service did not know that the White House had been struck by gunfire until days after the incident. Gowdy repeatedly asked Pierson why a housekeeper -- and not the Secret Service -- discovered the damage to the mansion. She answered, in part, that agents swept the area that night to look for injuries or an intruder and found nothing. She noted that it was also difficult to see at night. Pierson told the committee that any disciplinary action was pending the agency's investigation of the Gonzalez incident. But that answer did not satisfy Nevada Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford, who told her ""someone should be held accountable."" Pressed by Chaffetz about how many times she has personally briefed the president in 2014 about incidents involving his security Pierson said once, and it was regarding the September incursion by Gonzalez. The committee said that it would hold an executive session after the hearing so that Pierson could address some of the sensitive questions being asked. CNN's Ted Barrett, Josh Levs, Michael Martinez, Deirdre Walsh, Evan Perez, Joe Johns and Joshua Gaynor contributed to this report.","NEW: Whistleblower says an armed contractor was allowed on an elevator with Obama .

"(CNN) -- Two former top leaders in Cambodia's notorious Khmer Rouge, which ruled the Southeast Asian country between 1975 and 1979, were found guilty of crimes against humanity by a specially-convened Cambodian court Thursday. Before the verdict, only one person had been brought to justice over one of the 20th century's great atrocities. Nuon Chea, the former Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party of Kampuchea, and Khieu Samphan, the one-time President of Democratic Kampuchea both received life sentences. Nuon Chea, 88, known as ""Brother Number Two,"" and Khieu Samphan, 83, known as ""Brother Number Four,"" were expressionless as the verdict was read. They were found guilty of the following: Crimes against humanity, of extermination, murder, political persecution, and other inhumane acts comprising forced transfer, forced disappearances and attacks against human dignity committed within the territory of Cambodia between 17 April 1975 and December 1977. ""The chamber finds that as a consequence of the crimes of which the accused have been convicted, the civil parties and a very large number of additional victims have suffered immeasurable harm, including physical suffering, economic loss, loss of dignity, psychological trauma, and grief arising from the loss of family members and close relations,"" a judge said in the ruling. The men were taken into custody after their arrest in 2007. The defendants can appeal the judgment, and Victor Koppe, part of Nuon Chea's defense team, indicated that they would be seeking to exercise that right. The defense team for Khieu Samphan also said they would appeal the verdict. The charges were heard in Phnom Penh in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) -- a special United Nations-backed tribunal that was formed in 2006 to prosecute senior Khmer Rouge leaders and other regime figures responsible for especially heinous acts. Amnesty International welcomed the result as an important step towards justice. ""This long-awaited ruling is an important step towards justice for the victims of the Khmer Rouge period and highlights the importance of addressing impunity,"" said the organization's Deputy Asia-Pacific Director Rupert Abbott. ""But the earlier refusal of senior Cambodian government officials to give evidence, as well as allegations of political interference in other ECCC cases, is troubling and raises concerns around the fairness of the proceedings and respect for victims' right to hear the full truth regarding the alleged crimes."" Amnesty also welcomed the court's decision to endorse 11 reparation projects for victims. ""However, much more must also be done by the government of Cambodia towards repairing the harm suffered by victims."" A timeline of the Khmer Rouge regime and its aftermath . A bloody regime . The two men were senior leaders in the Khmer Rouge regime, which ruled Cambodia between 1975 and 1979. During that time at least 1.7 million people -- about a quarter of the Cambodian population -- are believed to have died from forced labor, starvation and execution, as the movement ruthlessly executed its radical social engineering policies aimed at creating a purely agrarian society. An ongoing struggle for justice after Khmer Rouge . The pair were tried in a ""hybrid"" tribunal -- officially ""an ad hoc Cambodian court with international participation"" -- uses both Cambodian and international judges and staff employed by the U.N. in order to ensure the trials are conducted to international standards and to mitigate against the weakness of the Cambodian legal system. ""This judgment represents an important milestone for Cambodians and victims around the world,"" a joint statement from the office of the co-prosecutors read. ""For 35 years (the leaders of the regime) evaded justice for some of some of the most brutal and cruel crimes ever committed."" Around 3,500 victims participated in the trial, as witnesses giving evidence, observers and in seeking reparations. ""The trial has allowed Cambodia to reset its moral compass, which was destroyed by the accused 40 years ago,"" the statement said. Until today's conclusion, the ECCC had delivered only one verdict in its eight years of existence. In the ECCC's Case 001, Kaing Guek Eav, commonly known by his alias, Duch, was sentenced to life imprisonment following his 2010 convictions for war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture. He was the commandant of the notorious Tuol Sleng S-21 prison in Phnom Penh, where more than 14,000 people died. The verdicts on Thursday in the case known as 002/01 was the first time that senior leaders of the regime have faced justice. Recognizing the limitations of the court, the ECCC's Legal Communications Officer Lars Olsen told CNN: ""We can't prosecute everyone who committed a crime 35 years ago. That's the nature of international justice."" Disappointment . Some victims of the crimes of the regime were not satisfied by the verdict. Theary Seng, founding president of the Center for Cambodian Civic Education, told CNN that the scope of the Court, and the trial, by focusing on the forced movements, and the murder of 250 Lon Nol (the previous Prime Minister) officials and troops at Tuol Po Chrey shortly after the regime was installed was insufficient. ""Cambodia hasn't got to the heart of the genocide. ""It's a missed opportunity... it completely missed the mark. What have we seen from $200 million and eight years (of the existence of the ECCC)? (It is) really a disservice to the other Cambodian victims."" She did allow that the trial was the ""beginning of a process of healing"" and that it would ""serve as a catalyst for conversations in Cambodia about our past."" Seng was just seven years old in 1978 when both her parents were killed after several months in prison. It was at a time when the leadership was, she said, in ""extreme paranoia"" and even party cadres were being purged. Her mother was taken from the cell she shared with her children and other families, and ""tiptoed to her death"" to avoid waking up Seng and her younger brother. ""The tragedy of my story is that it's so common,"" she said. ""It stays with us -- how can it not?""

"(CNN) -- It was an election night like none other, in every sense of the phrase. In addition to the obvious -- the selection of the nation's first black president -- Tuesday night's coverage on CNN showcased groundbreaking technology. CNN's Jessica Yellin appears live as a hologram before anchor Wolf Blitzer Tuesday night in New York. ""I want you to watch what we're about to do,"" CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer told viewers early in the evening's coverage, ""because you've never seen anything like this on television."" And he was right. Cue CNN political correspondent Jessica Yellin. ""Hi Wolf!"" said Yellin, waving to Blitzer as she stood a few feet in front of him in the network's New York City studios. Or at least, that's the way it appeared at first glance. In reality, Yellin -- a correspondent who had been covering Sen. Barack Obama's campaign -- was at the now president-elect's mega-rally along the lakefront in Chicago, Illinois, more than 700 miles away from CNN's Election Center in New York. It looked like a scene straight out of ""Star Wars."" Here was Yellin, partially translucent with a glowing blue haze around her, appearing to materialize in thin air. She even referenced the classic movie on her own, saying, ""It's like I follow in the tradition of Princess Leia. It's something else.""  Watch a behind-the-scenes look at CNN's hologram project » . Jay Leno has poked fun at the hologram, and mash-up spoofs that replace Yellin's voice with Carrie Fisher's lines from the movie already are making their way around the Internet. But the million-dollar question on everyone's mind now: How'd they do it? CNN dubbed it a ""hologram"" -- a three-dimensional image that's been reproduced. And it's the brainchild of a few people. A hologram creates an image using coherent light, such as lasers; CNN's technique used conventional cameras to capture multiple images from different angles. ""About a dozen years, I've been trying to do it,"" David Bohrman, CNN's senior vice president and Washington bureau chief, said to Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" on Wednesday. ""I've basically been a crazy mad scientist trying to get it done."" The technology involved placing a subject -- in this case Yellin, and later in the evening, musical artist Will.i.am -- in the middle of a bright-green circular room inside a large tent at Obama's Grant Park victory celebration. The subject was then filmed with 35 high-definition video cameras, barely larger than average point-and-shoot cameras, which ringed the wall of the circular room. The video cameras were 6 inches apart and at eye level, 220 degrees around the subject. Chuck Hurley, the Washington bureau's senior producer of video and the staffer tapped by Bohrman to manage the execution of the ""hologram,"" called it simple chroma-key technology that's been taken ""to the Nth degree.""  Watch the hologram on air » . ""Weathermen have been standing in front of green screens for years now, but that's [with] one camera,"" Hurley said. ""Now we can do that times 35, so you can send all the way around the subject."" Hurley said the tiny cameras ""talk"" to the New York studio's cameras, meaning that when a New York camera moves, it ""tells"" the cameras in the tent which direction it's moving and keeps the subject in the correct proportions. On Tuesday night, Blitzer could only see Yellin on a TV monitor across the studio. Technicians placed a round piece of red laminate on the studio floor where she was ""beamed in"" so that Blitzer would know where to look. The technology in play was originally developed by Israeli-based company SportVU (pronounced ""sport view"") as a new way of filming soccer games. Gal Oz, a SportVU designer who came to the United States to work with CNN on the endeavor, said it was originally designed ""to create a matrix effect in sports"" -- in other words, to provide 360 degrees of perspective for instant replays. But it hasn't been used for its intended purpose yet. Instead, for the past three months, the company has been perfecting it for CNN's election coverage, Oz said. Tuesday night's live interview of Yellin was essentially the technology's world debut as well. Hurley and Oz agree that as good as the image looked on television Tuesday, it can look even more realistic. Hurley said the blue glow around Yellin and Will.i.am was added intentionally to avoid confusion. ""We could have had a much crisper, more realistic shot, almost to the extent where the viewer at home would have had no idea even that the person wasn't really there,"" Hurley said. ""You don't want to have the effect where it looks so good that for every future live shot, you have people on the blogs saying, 'Oh they're not really there--they're in a studio, faking the moon landing.' "" Hurley said considering it was CNN's first real ""test launch"" with the high-end gadgetry, they were ""beyond thrilled."" That's not to say there weren't setbacks. For all the preparation that went into the tent and green room in Chicago -- a location CNN staffers dubbed ""Casper"" after the friendly cartoon ghost -- there was an equally elaborate setup in Phoenix, Arizona, site of John McCain's election night rally. CNN correspondent Dana Bash was ready there for her turn in the portal as well. But because the Arizona site didn't go through as much testing in the final hours, and because the election was called in Obama's favor earlier in the evening than many expected, Chicago's ""Casper"" was the only ""hologram' venue put to use. Hurley and Oz both said they couldn't put a price tag on the total cost of such technology. But could this become a staple of future TV news? ""We'll see. It was a little ornament on the tree,"" Bohrman said. ""But television evolves, and how we do things evolves, and at some point -- maybe it's five years or 10 years or 20 years down the road -- I think there's going to be a way that television does interviews like this because it allows for a much more intimate possibility for a remote interview."" The day after her virtual appearance in New York, Yellin said this kind of new technology is what keeps television news entertaining, even when it's presenting important political stories. ""We do serious journalism, but we also have fun. This is fun. This is about what we can do, about pushing the envelope and pushing the boundaries,"" she said. ""Someday when this is even more advanced, having a fuller visual field for interview subjects could give viewers even more of a sense of people."" Now, in hindsight, Yellin only wishes she could have come up with a better ""Star Wars"" joke. ""I was thinking of making an Obi-Wan Kenobi joke -- Obi-Wolf Kenobi,"" she said, laughing, ""but I couldn't figure out the pun.""","CNN ""beamed"" a correspondent from Chicago to its New York studios Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday I had the privilege of meeting with S. Ganbaatar, a member of the Mongolian Parliament. When he entered the room, Ganbaatar walked up excitedly to examine a framed document that has hung for years in my offices. The document is a list of commitments to the people, signed by dozens of candidates for public office who promised to vote on a specific policy agenda if they were elected to office. It's framed alongside a picture of the candidates who signed and campaigned on it. Many of them went on to be elected in a historic vote that tossed out a party that had held power since the 1920s. Ganbaatar was looking at a framed copy of the 1996 ""Contract with the Mongolian Voter."" That contract was, as the Washington Post reported the next year, ""the most widely distributed document in Mongolian history."" The Mongolian voters -- with a 91% turnout -- elected the democratic opposition, which four years earlier had held just six seats. With a program of ""private property rights, a free press and the encouragement of foreign investment,"" they defeated the Communist Party that had ruled since 1921. Ganbaatar, who was elected to Parliament as an Independent in 2012 and is already one of his country's most popular politicians, recounted emotionally how the Contract with the Voter was a watershed event in modern Mongolian history. The ideas in that document, he told me, ""gave us our freedom."" Mongolia's peaceful, democratic transition of power from the communists to a republican government was one of the few hopeful stories to come out of the former Soviet states in the early years after the Cold War. It was fitting, but only a coincidence, that Ganbaatar visited just a few days before the 20th anniversary of the Contract with America, the inspiration for Mongolia's Contract with the Voters. On September 27, 1994, more than 350 candidates for Congress gathered on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to sign a pledge to the American people, a promise to vote on 10 key reforms if we won a majority in the House of Representatives. That campaign, which I helped organize, earned Republicans control of the House for the first time in 40 years. The Contract was a campaign document. It laid out a common-sense program that was designed to earn the support of the broadest possible range of Americans. Its assortment of policies included everything from changes to how the House did business to items on the budget, welfare and tax policy. But more than any particular proposal, the important thing about the document was its form: It was a contract, a real commitment to reform and accountability and renewal. It sought above all to ""restore the bonds of trust between the people and their elected representatives."" We knew Americans deserved a clear and unambiguous account of what we planned to do, and believed reform required their explicit support -- and that if we broke faith with them, we wouldn't deserve to hold power. So we invited people to vote us out again if we didn't follow through. But we did follow through -- in an extraordinary first hundred days that kicked off one of the most productive Congresses in American history. In addition to being a campaign document, the Contract was a management document that told us how we would govern. It led directly or indirectly to all of the achievements that would soon follow, including four straight balanced budgets, welfare reform, and the largest capital gains tax cut in American history. In retrospect, it's clear that the Contract also marked an enduring political realignment. When the Republican House majority was sworn in in 1995, there was only one Republican in the House (Bill Emerson from Missouri) who had ever served under a majority -- and he had done so as a page. Two years later, we became the first Republican majority that had been reelected since 1928. And since the Contract, Republicans have held the House for 16 of the past 20 years, and should continue to hold it for the foreseeable future. As a detailed commitment to passing specific bills, the Contract was the first document of its kind in American history. It has now been replicated in other countries, like Italy and Mongolia, not because of its policy content, but because it expressed a hope in the heart of every voter -- an aspiration that, in the case of the U.S. -- didn't end with the election of 1994 and certainly did not begin there. The Contract was, quite literally, a renewal of a pre-existing commitment, one that had not been honored. It was the commitment that elected representatives of the people remain accountable to the people. This social contract is essential to self-government, but too often, our leaders abandon it once they join the political class. They forget about who put them there, they contrive to shield themselves from ""tough votes,"" and they stretch further the restraints on their powers under the law. There's nothing like a visit by a legislator from a place where, for the better part of the last century, lawlessness reigned, to remind you that the contract between the people and their representatives must be constantly renewed and ardently defended.","Newt Gingrich says Mongolia was influenced by Contract with America .

"Washington (CNN) -- On Tuesday, more than 42 years after Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Richard L. Etchberger died on a Laotian mountaintop, President Obama will award him the Medal of Honor, the military's highest award for bravery. But for decades even Etchberger's own children didn't know about his heroism. Cory Etchberger was in third grade in 1968, when he was told that his father had died in a helicopter accident in Southeast Asia. At age 29 he learned the truth, when the U.S. Air Force declassified his father's story. ""I was stunned,"" he told CNN during a visit to his hometown of Hamburg, Pennsylvania. During the Vietnam War, U.S. troops weren't supposed to be in neutral Laos, so Richard Etchberger and a handful of colleagues shed their uniforms and posed as civilians to run a top-secret radar installation high on a Laotian cliff. Called Lima Site 85, it guided U.S. bombers to sites in North Vietnam and parts of Laos under communist control. The North Vietnamese wanted to eliminate the installation, and early on the morning of March 11, 1968, its soldiers succeeded in scaling the 3,000-foot precipice and launching an attack. Timothy Castle, of the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence, wrote the book ""One Day Too Long: Top Secret Site 85 and the Bombing of North Vietnam."" He calls Etchberger ""a hero."" Castle said Etchberger, a technician, picked up an M16 rifle, which he barely knew how to use, and ferociously protected his colleagues. One of them was Stanley Sliz. ""I got hit in both legs,"" Sliz remembered, ""and everybody was screaming and hollering, but they weren't able to get close because of Etch firing at them."" John Daniel still has scars from the shrapnel wounds he got that day. ""He was the only one that didn't get injured in the firefight,"" he recalled. ""They kept throwing grenades and shooting, and we kept picking up hand grenades and throwing them, or kicking them to the other side of the mountain."" When a helicopter flown by CIA-affiliated Air America arrived to evacuate them, Etchberger braved enemy fire to load three wounded comrades, including Daniel and Sliz, onto hoists. ""Thank God for Dick Etchberger. If it wasn't for him, I would not be alive today,"" Daniel told CNN. Etchberger made it onto the chopper unwounded. But as it began to pull away, enemy shots rang out. Sliz said he saw a splotch of red, and realized the man who had saved his life had lost his own. One round had hit Etchberger and killed him. ""I live it every day,"" said Sliz. ""I live it every day. It haunts me."" Shortly after Etchberger's death, he was secretly awarded the Air Force Cross for bravery. He was recommended for the Medal of Honor, but then-President Lyndon Johnson rejected the idea, fearing it would expose the U.S. military's activities in Laos. In his hometown of Hamburg, American flags fly from the light poles and men congregate on the steps of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Since Etchberger's story became public, a memorial has been erected commemorating his heroism, and his name is proudly displayed on the town's sign. But now there is an addition: a hand-drawn banner reading ""Medal of Honor winner."" Though the battle of Lima Site 85 took place more than four decades ago, Castle believes it is important to recognize the heroism of the men who were there. ""We have these extraordinary folks in the U.S. military who are willing to accept these types of missions and to go to these very remote places in very dangerous conditions,"" he said. ""The men that went to Site 85 had every reason to believe that no one in the public would ever know anything about what they were doing or what they had done, but they went anyway."" Etchberger's three sons will be at the White House Medal of Honor ceremony Tuesday. So will John Daniel, whose life he saved. ""There might be some tears there. Carpet in that White House may be wet. But we'll make it,"" said Daniel. But Castle noted that the full story of Lima Site 85 still isn't known. Ten technicians who were on the Laotian mountaintop with Etchberger, Daniel, and Sliz that March morning in 1968 have never been accounted for. CNN's Jim Spellman, Sara Weisfeldt and Floyd Yarmuth contributed to this report.","Richard Etchberger to be awarded the military's highest award for bravery .

"(CNN) -- Missiles fired by a U.S. drone killed three people in Pakistan early Thursday, Pakistani intelligence officials said, the first such attack since Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif asked U.S. President Barack Obama to end the campaign of drone strikes. The strike in northwest Pakistan also comes the week after human rights groups questioned the legality of the U.S. drone program in Pakistan and Yemen, documenting in detail some of the civilian casualties they say it has caused. The identity of the three people killed in the drone attack Thursday on a compound in the thinly governed tribal area of North Waziristan hasn't yet been confirmed but they are believed to be militants, said two Pakistani intelligence officials. Three other people were wounded in the strike near Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan, said the officials, who declined to be identified because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The Pakistani government ""strongly condemns"" the latest drone strike, the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. North Waziristan is rife with militants and is the area where the United States conducts its most intensive drone campaign, against the Pakistani Taliban and al Qaeda operatives. Sharif said last week that he brought up the issue of drone attacks with Obama when the two leaders met in Washington, ""emphasizing the need for an end to such strikes."" Ahead of that meeting, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch released highly critical reports on the U.S. drone program. The groups said some of the attacks may have violated international law, a charge the White House denied. This week, members of a Pakistani family cited in the Amnesty report visited Washington to talk about a drone strike that killed a 68-year-old grandmother. The dead woman's son and grandchildren said that by telling their story to members of Congress, they hope it will influence lawmakers to curtail the number of drone strikes in Pakistan. The U.S. government has said strikes by the unmanned aircraft are a necessary and carefully scrutinized part of the fight against militant groups. ""The administration has repeatedly emphasized the extraordinary care that we take to make sure that counterterrorism actions are in accordance with all applicable law,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said last week.","The attack hits a compound in North Waziristan in northwest Pakistan, officials say .

"(CNN) -- The midterm elections are less than three weeks away, but by several measures, Democrats have already won. Sure, elections are about the race to the top between competing candidates, but they're also a barometer on long-term trends, issues and party trajectories. While the winners of this season's sprints have yet to be determined, Democrats look well-positioned for the lengthier political marathon. How? 1. There's still a contest for the Senate . Historically, the party in the White House tends to lose seats in Congress during midterm elections. The second midterm election of a two-term president -- as this election is for President Barack Obama -- is usually brutal. Only six times since the Civil War has a president come close to gaining seats in both chambers in a sixth-year election. Add to that this year there are simply more Democratic-held Senate seats up for grabs -- with more ranked ""toss ups"" than Republican-held seats -- and the very fact that Democrats still have a shot at holding onto the Senate is, as Vice President Joe Biden might say, a BFD. 2. Democratic policies are emerging as third rails . Witness Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, running for re-election in Kentucky, and the dance he did around Obamacare during a debate. McConnell insisted that he would repeal Obamacare ""root and branch"" but somehow, miraculously, keep the law's state-based health insurance exchange. This shows that despite the lackluster rollout of the Obamacare website, voters still overwhelmingly support the particular details and programs of the law, even in places such as Kentucky, where over 400,000 people have enrolled for health coverage under Obamacare's provisions. As the law continues to take hold -- and become more effective and popular -- that rhetorical dance will get more uncomfortable for Republicans, who are still struggling to reconcile their opposition to equal pay legislation, raising the minimum wage, refinancing student loans and extending benefits for the unemployed. When President Obama said -- ""I am not on the ballot this fall. Michelle's pretty happy about that. But make no mistake: these policies are on the ballot"" -- he was right. And when the American people weigh in on Democratic policies, they'll probably side with Democrats. 3. Voters know about ""Republican War on Women"" In 2012, it was easy to say the whole ""War on Women"" thing was an aberration that can be blamed on a few errant GOP candidates such as Todd Aiken. But this year, Republicans doubled down on their attacks on women's opportunity and reproductive freedom -- and the ""Republican War on Women"" brand will now forevermore stick. In New Hampshire, the Republican platform has adopted ""fetal personhood"" into its state party platform, echoing conservative-backed referenda on the ballots in Colorado, Tennessee and North Dakota that would severely restrict women's control over their own pregnancies. Republicans also opposed the mandate in Obamacare to make birth control affordable and accessible through all health insurance. They have also blocked equal pay legislation and held up re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act. Economic equality and reproductive freedom are basic priorities for women voters, a group that Republicans already had a tough time winning over. The GOP even commissioned its own poll that found women voters are ""barely receptive"" to Republican ideas and think the party is ""intolerant"" and ""stuck in the past."" By their own deeds, not to mention rhetoric, Republicans just keep reinforcing their war on women and driving voters away. 4. Republicans appear desperate . Wasn't this election supposed to be about Obamacare? No, that didn't work. So Republicans tried to make the midterms about Benghazi. No luck there either. Now they're just generally fear-mongering around ISIS and Ebola and hoping that would work. But the constantly shifting Republican shell game shows how little substantive traction conservatives have with average voters outside their highly gerrymandered House districts. Every time they open their mouths, Republican candidates show that they habitually bash President Obama to distract from the impression that they have neither the intention nor ability to help solve urgent problems facing the country. When you're so worried about the outcome of an election you actively try to discourage Americans from voting, even if it means violating the constitution and values you're sworn to protect. Mind you, it's deeply disturbing that Republicans have used the fig leaf of voter fraud to justify disenfranchising countless legitimate voters to serve their partisan ends. But voter ID laws are a kind of Hail Mary pass thrown by a GOP all too aware that if it just lets everyone keep voting, Republicans are going to keep losing elections -- especially as the American electorate gets younger and more racially diverse. That Republicans don't mind alienating voters by opposing same-sex marriage and immigration reform, which most young voters support, suggests a profound desperation -- namely, a party aware that it can't transform itself for the future and so willing to settle for last gasps of power with its old white voter base. Meanwhile, Democrats are registering new progressive voters in states such as Georgia and Texas at unprecedented rates. We still don't know which party will prevail on Election Day this November. But if these trends are any indication, it will soon become clear which party will increasingly prevail in elections down the road -- the kind of ultimate victory that really counts.","Sally Kohn: Midterm elections are also a gauge for trends and party trajectories .
Kohn: By that measure, Democrats have won on issues and policies that matter to the public .
She says GOP's war on women have turned off voters; some Republicans act desperate .
Kohn: Democrats will likely prevail in elections down the road, which is the ultimate victory ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Warren Buffett is so sure that Hillary Clinton will win the presidency in 2016, he is willing to wager some of his $58.2 billion net worth. ""Hillary is going to win, yeah,"" Buffett, a outspoken Clinton supporter, said at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit. ""I will bet money on it. And I don't do that easily."" But while Clinton has said she is thinking about running for president, she has yet to announce. Buffett suggested on Tuesday that her announcement is a forgone conclusion. ""Hillary is going to run,"" said the chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway, later adding that ""she is going to announce as late as possible."" ""I don't see how you could have anybody better qualified,"" Buffett told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an interview. ""I like what she believes in. ... I think she's extraordinarily able and energetic for that matter in pushing those beliefs."" Buffett has long supported Clinton -- he donated $2,000 to her Senate campaign in 2000. But the investor from Omaha, Nebraska, supported Clinton and then-Sen. Barack Obama in their fight for the Democratic nomination in 2008.

"(CNN) -- Venice is romantic and unforgettable on any budget, but it can be dazzling if you are willing to splurge. Open your wallet wide -- very wide -- and you'll find suites with stunning views of the Grand Canal, poshly furnished rooms fit for a royal and Murano glass chandeliers to light up your night. No wonder some of the world's richest and most famous tourists feel right at home when they come to the City of Water. ""It's a magical place,"" said Joyce Falcone, owner of The Italian Concierge, who travels to Venice about twice a year -- drawn, like many people, by its unique ambiance, color and history. 5 surprisingly raunchy destinations in Europe . We asked Falcone; Venice native Roberto Agostini of Precision Travel; and Andrea Sertoli, president of Select Italy, to pick their favorite luxury Venice hotels. Here are some of their recommendations. Hotel Cipriani . Located on the tip of Giudecca Island, this hotel has it all, Sertoli said, calling it elegant, stylish and romantic. Stay in the main building or the Palazzo Vendramin, a 15th-century residence near the hotel. Both offer opulent rooms and suites, including the Palladio Suite, which has a private dock and sweeping views over the Venetian lagoon through floor-to-ceiling windows. The hotel is one of only two in Venice to offer a swimming pool, Agostini said, while the surrounding gardens can be used for weddings and receptions. And come September, the Cipriani fills up with movie stars and celebrities in town for the Venice Film Festival. But the hotel always manages to maintain an aura of serenity. ""It's laid back because it's away from the madness of St. Mark's [Square]. ... They also have a great pool and grounds, which is pretty novel in Venice with land at a premium,"" Falcone said. ""A lot of people think St. Mark's Square is the spot to be. For me, it's just way too crowded. I would prefer to be away where it's quiet and just go there when you feel like it, but then be able to escape to your gorgeous, luxurious hotel that's away from all of that."" Rates for a junior suite start at about $2,450 per night. For more information, click here. Hotel Danieli . If you do want to stay in the center of it all, the Danieli is a stunning option. Located next to Doge's Palace and the Bridge of Sighs, it is just steps away from St. Mark's Square. This is the hotel that Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp checked into in ""The Tourist,"" and depending on the room you choose, the lagoon views can be as stunning as those seen in the movie. Hotel Danieli is made up of three palazzi dating back to the 14th, 19th and 20th centuries, so expect luxurious surroundings that feature marble columns, antique carpets and gilded ceilings. Recent renovations have returned the hotel to the list of top accommodations in Venice, Sertoli said. Because it is part of the Luxury Collection, many of Falcone's clients like it because they can use Starwood points to book their stay. ""It is an old Venetian classic, and you can't go wrong by selecting the Danieli,"" Falcone said. A lagoon view suite starts at about $2,520 per night. For more information, click here. Hotel Gritti Palace . Commissioned by the doge of Venice in 1525, Gritti Palace was the residence of noble families for hundreds of years until it was turned into a posh hotel at the beginning of the 19th century. Located about three blocks from St. Mark's Square, the palazzo faces the Grand Canal and offers guests views that extend from San Giorgio Island, to the church of Santa Maria della Salute, and over to the Accademia. ""It's a very classical Venetian palace,"" Agostini said, calling it ""very luxurious."" Splurge for a Grand Canal suite, and you will be surrounded by antique furnishings, walls hung with paintings and embroidered damask drapes. (Gritti Palace may not be the best choice if you're not a fan of very ornate interiors. Some travelers find the hotel too stuffy, Agostini said.) Most importantly, floor-to-ceiling windows and balconies allow you to make the most of the beautiful location. Rates for Grand Canal suites start at about $4,000 per night. The hotel is also part of the Luxury Collection, so you can book your stay with Starwood points. For more information, click here. Ca' Sagredo Hotel . This 14th century palazzo with a pink facade is a hotel, a national monument and a museum all rolled into one. Once home to the Sagredos, a noble Venetian family, the palace opened as a hotel in 2007 after an extensive restoration. Guests will find opulent decor and incredible stucco works, frescoes, paintings, canvas and architectural features. The hotel is a short walk away from St. Mark's Square, between Ca' D'Oro and the Rialto Bridge. ""We like it a lot,"" Sertoli said, while Agostini called it a ""fantastic"" and ""unbelievable."" The Ca' Sagredo is near the Venice Casino, so it might be a good pick for visitors who like to gamble, Falcone said. ""It's absolutely beautiful if you get one of the rooms that are on the piano nobile -- the main floor where the family did live. Those rooms are frescoed, and they face the Grand Canal and they're huge,"" Falcone said. The Grand Canal presidential suite starts at about $1,200 per night in August. For more information, click here. San Clemente Palace Hotel & Resort . Located on a private island on the site of a former 17th century monastery, the resort boasts views of St. Mark's Square, Giudecca Island and the Lido. It's perfect for families, because children will enjoy the beautiful, spacious grounds, Agostini said. The island also offers lots of activities for kids, like treasure hunts and tennis lessons. For fitness-minded guests, there's golf, swimming and jogging. ""It's a beautiful hotel,"" Agostini said, praising its subdued elegance. He once leased the whole island for a group event, and he has recommended the resort for weddings and receptions. But be warned: The hotel is big -- Agostini estimated its size at about three square blocks -- so be prepared to walk a bit to get to your room. Rates for a classic suite start at about $1,075 per night in August. For more information, click here.","Visit these Venice hotels to feel pampered and surrounded by luxury .

"Shanghai (CNN) -- Kungfu Komedy Club looks much like any other back room in a Shanghai bar. But at show time, the Chinese mainland's first and only full-time stand-up comedy club becomes a carefully-honed weapon of mass hilarity directed at the audience of locals, expats and tourists that frequently packs the room. The club is at the epicenter of a thriving stand-up scene that a few years ago did not exist in the city, and that ultimately could bring stand-up comedy -- an artform virtually unknown in China -- to the masses. Kungfu Komedy started in February 2011 when a small group of enthusiastic novices put on a show in the corner of a dive bar. The group's Australian founder, Andy Curtain, is the first to admit it was ""as bad as you'd expect."" They spent the next year honing their craft. Towards the end of 2012 a downtown sports bar offered them permanent use of a room. The Chinese mainland had its first full-time comedy club. The group holds three open mics a week -- two in English, one in Chinese -- plus weekend showcases, and also brings in professionals from across the world. In its wake, other open mics have sprung up, giving comedians -- both locals and expats -- stage time in which to develop. Deadpan delivery . Leia Luo is a local Shanghai comedian who performs in English, sharing her surreal musings with a mesmerizingly deadpan delivery. ""Doing stand-up comedy helps me, a very introverted person, express my weird thoughts,"" she says. ""When I'm telling a joke, I'm not really trying to be funny, I'm trying to express ideas that the audience might find amusing."" The candid self-expression of stand-up is one of the aspects that appeals to the younger generation in China, according to the founders of Kungfu Komedy's Chinese-language counterpart, Xiaodao Wenhua. Wang Yan and Li Daisong were inspired by the success Kungfu Komedy was having with English-language stand-up. But with stand-up a virtually unknown concept in China, they marketed their first few shows as networking events. ""We said let's have a party, and we can tell jokes,"" says Wang. ""This way we didn't have to explain what stand-up was. Then, step by step, we introduced the concept, linking it to similar concepts in traditional Chinese comedy."" The approached worked. Xiaodao Wenhua now puts on monthly theater shows that attract between 800 and 1,000 people. It has around 14 regular comedians, and holds workshops to train others. While stand-up is a tough sell to the older generation, who were brought up in a culture ""based on wanting people to be the same,"" Li says there is a thirst for it among younger people. ""We really feel like we're helping a generation by giving them an outlet so they can do new things and be themselves. Many people are making money, but they are not happy. Everyone has this hidden side to them,"" he says. Alien art form? Los Angeles-based comic Butch Bradley was the first international headliner Kungfu Komedy brought to the city in 2012. In September 2013 he returned for a 10-month residency at the club. Bradley was particularly impressed by the young Chinese comedians he saw performing an art form alien to their culture, and in their second language. ""The Chinese youth are the coolest,"" he says. ""Local comedians like Storm Xu, Alana Fu and Leia Luo get up and talk about their feelings, and audiences that were 10% Chinese go up to 35% Chinese. The next great frontier for comedy is China, and the heart will be Shanghai,"" says Bradley. Curtain agrees that seeing Chinese comics emerge is the most exciting thing about his role, and that Chinese rather than expats are the club's ultimate target audience. ""There are more and more 'haigui' -- Chinese who were educated overseas -- returning to China. They really want to see stand-up,"" he says. In the meantime, Shanghai is getting a name for itself on the international comedy circuit. Big names to have visited include Tom Rhodes, Ari Shaffir and Wil Sylvince. Curtain says they get emails every week from established comedians looking to come out, and that they turn down a lot more people than they accept. Later this year, U.S. comic Joe Klocek will start a two-month residency, while Kungfu Komedy will move to a larger floor of its host bar, expanding its capacity to some 150 seats. There are also plans to set up comedy rooms across the country so comics can regularly tour more out-of-the-way spots. Restrictions . For aspiring comics, it's a great time to be in Shanghai. One of the founding members of Kungfu Komedy, Audrey Murray, now splits her time between Shanghai and New York, where she hosts the Greenpoint Comedy Night at Word Bookstore. She says when she sees comedians who are just starting out in New York, she wants to tell them to move to Shanghai. ""Although there are fewer opportunities to get on stage in Shanghai, the quality of the stage time for those starting out is incomparable,"" she says. ""It's easier to stick with it, because the good sets will far outnumber the bad. You also get to do longer sets."" But can stand-up -- the art form of agitators such as Lenny Bruce and George Carlin -- flourish in China as anything other than a neutered imitation? Curtain says they have a good idea of what's not allowed. ""It's kind of like living in China -- once you know what the rules are, you're pretty much free to do anything else,"" he says. ""The restriction the government places on us is no greater than the restriction the audience places on us."" For Butch Bradley, the restrictions are part of what makes things interesting. ""China is changing and opening up, and Shanghai is the perfect place for the experiment. They are saying 'don't think for a moment we aren't watching, but go ahead, we want to check this out.'""","Stand-up comedy is an art form virtually unknown in China .

"(CNN) -- Bubba Watson secured his first World Golf Championship title and first win outside of the United States Sunday -- but in typical fashion took his own very individual route to an unlikely victory. The two-time Masters champion held a two-shot lead with three holes to play in the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai before going bogey-double bogey to trail by one playing the 18th at the Sheshan International course. His hopes looked over when his second shot to the par-five found a green side bunker but the 36-year-old American had one more moment of magic left in his locker. He blasted the ball onto the green and then watched as it rolled 25-feet into the cup for an eagle three. That left him tied on 11-under 277 with South African Tim Clark and a playoff followed over the same 18th hole. A pumped up Watson was not to be denied and a 20-foot birdie putt was enough for him to secure his seventh career victory and third of 2014, including the Masters at Augusta. ""For me this is the big one,"" Watson told the European Tour website. ""It's very big because I always wanted to win outside the U.S."" Watson said the his wonder shot on the final hole of regulation play came as a surprise even to him. ""It was such a tough bunker shot you are not really thinking about making it, but I told my caddie it's been a wild day, a wild couple of holes, but if we can make this it changes everything and it went in like a putt."" Overnight leader Graeme McDowell, who had been at the head of affairs since the first day, saw his chances disappear with a final round 73 to end in a tie for third with American Rickie Fowler and Hiroshi Iwata of Japan. All three also had chances on the final hole of at least joining the playoff, but Fowler found the water while McDowell and Iwata could not make the requisite birdie. U.S. Open champion Martin Kaymer was another in the mix, but he found the water on the 18th with his second shot and made a double bogey seven to finish in a tie for sixth on eight under with England's Ian Poulter and Thorbjorn Olesen of Norway. World number one Rory McIlroy did not take part in the tournament while Watson will rise to third in the rankings after his latest victory.","Bubba Watson wins WGC tournament in Shanghai .

"(CNN) -- Gross is par for the course when it comes to ""The Walking Dead."" From the zombie autopsy in the premiere episode of season 2 and the trough scene just last week, to just general feasting by the undead, the hit AMC series is not for the squeamish. But even die-hard fans were a little shocked Sunday night at a scene in which the character Gareth and his group of hunters turn into cannibals and eat Bob's leg. Happy early Halloween people! How do you think that scene compares to these other stomach-turning TV moments? 1) A foot meets a chainsaw on ""Grey's Anatomy"" Back in 2007, the medical series did a Halloween-themed episode that should have prepared us for anything. Hardly anyone saw it coming when a disturbed patient, who was convinced his left foot didn't belong to him, got hold of another patient's chainsaw and tried to take it off. Dr. Callie Torres finished the job for him. 2) Mama Pope gets desperate on ""Scandal"" Last season, fans of ABC's ""Scandal"" watched horrified as Olivia Pope's mother tried to gnaw through her own wrist in a ""suicide"" attempt meant to get her transported from being locked up to a hospital facility. It worked and the scene led to some hilarious memes. 3) Butt wait on ""House"" On the now canceled Fox series, they gave a cadaver a colonoscopy with disastrous results. It wasn't pretty when the water pressure caused the dead body's innards to explode all over Dr. Eric Foreman. Seriously. 4) Pig out on ""Survivor: South Pacific"" Things can get pretty gross in the world of reality TV, too, but in 2011 contestants on the CBS reality competition had to snag hunks of pig using only their mouths - and they weren't allowed to swallow. So in addition to watching them make a mess of the swine, viewers also got to watch the contestants spit. 5) Eye-popping scene on ""Game of Thrones"" The HBO fantasy series ""Game of Thrones"" is another that is known to not spare the eyes of fans, and during this past season there was a scene involving a character's orbs. During a ""trial by combat,"" a character known as The Mountain gouged out the eyes of another using a technique that would be the envy of any slasher film villain.","There was a gross scene on Sunday's ""The Walking Dead""

"(CNN) -- When Christie's launches the latest auction at its New York showroom this evening, gavels will fall. Prices, however, will almost certainly rise ... and rise. For its Post-war Masters and Contemporary Evening Sale, one of this year's headline art auctions, Christie's has on offer masterpieces including Francis Bacon's Three Studies for a Portrait of John Edwards, Gerhard Richter's Abstraktes Bild (712), and Mark Rothko's Untitled during a night expected to fetch well north of $200 million. Christie's estimates that the Richter work will command a price of between $22 and $28 million, the Rothko between $40 and $60 million, and the Bacon triptych around $80 million. The house has reason to be upbeat with its estimates. On May 12, during an auction titled ""If I Live I'll See You Tuesday,"" buyers from 26 countries splashed out on contemporary works by artists including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Jeff Koons and Richard Prince. Christie's sold $134.6 million of art in an hour. Speaking to journalists after the show, Christie's Chief Executive Officer Steven Murphy suggested that buyers from emerging markets are helping keep the market vibrant. ""The number of people around the world interested in acquiring art at all levels is exploding,"" he said. ""We are not in a bubble."" Viola Raikhel-Bolot, the director of global art advisory firm 1858 Ltd Art Advisory, believes international buyers will turn out en masse for tonight's auction. ""The place to buy post-war and contemporary art seems to remain New York,"" she says. ""Collectors from Latin America and Asia frequent the galleries here and follow these sales very closely."" Read ""The dark side of creativity: Depression + anxiety x madness = genius?"" Boom times . In recent years sales of fine art have trended in one direction: up. According to the annual report of the European Fine Art Fair, global sales of fine art and antiques jumped 7.5% in 2013 to $65.5 billion, just under the all-time high set in 2007. This includes auction sales and estimates of anonymous sales. In 2013, Christie's tallied more than $7 billion in sales, breaking its own record for the fourth consecutive year. In November 2013, a Christie's auction in New York brought in $782,368,375, the highest auction series in art market history. Jeff Koons's Balloon Dog sold for $58.4 million, making it the most valuable work sold at auction by a living artist and at the same auction, Francis Bacon's triptych of Lucian Feud, sold for $142 million. Andrew Renton, director of London's Marlborough Contemporary gallery and a professor of curating at Goldsmiths College at the University of London, points out that there are many more deals going on in private, and that some likely outstrip existing records. ""We've got an economic model which is slightly contradictory,"" Renton says. ""Prices seem to set the value. Overpaying is almost the best thing you can do, because you start to define your own market."" But this isn't a free-for-all. He believes buyers with deep pockets want superlative works that delve into our psyche. ""Bacon works on that model,"" he says. ""He gets into the soul of the anxious human being. And in Rothko the abstraction is a reflection of the darkness and the contemporary condition. ""People talk about these things in monetary terms. You don't get to that monetary value unless there is a correlation with cultural value."" As classic works become more scarce, their value will continue to rise -- as will the hoopla surrounding them. ""I do not believe there is a price ceiling,"" Renton says. ""In our lifetime we will see a billion dollar work of art.""","Insiders believe that we will see a billion-dollar piece of art in our lifetime .

"(CNN) -- Route 66 has been called ""the most famous highway in the world,"" and it remains the ultimate road trip. Within the United States and to travelers from around the globe, Route 66 is on par with the Alamo and the Statue of Liberty as an icon of America. Route 66 offers today's travelers the chance to press their noses against the window peering into another time, and it shows us an America that still exists off the modern freeway system. Here's a glimpse into that world, with seven things most folks don't know about Route 66. 1. Over 2,000 of Route 66's original 2,448 connected miles are still approachable, if not always drivable. While there are many lovely stretches and remarkable towns to be found along the way, ""roadies"" still debate which is the top stretch of Route 66 for a modern day road trip. When autumn leaves fall . Some say the best unbroken drives happen along Oklahoma's 400 miles of the old road, much of it uninterrupted by the interstate. Or possibly the most memorable drive is the 158 continuous miles on Route 66 heading west from Seligman, Arizona, and on to the California state line and Topock. Uncontested: Kansas has always had the shortest length of this road in any of the eight Route 66 states, and all 13 historic miles are drivable today through Galena and Baxter Springs. 2. John Steinbeck conceived of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" on a late 1937 summer drive from Chicago west on Route 66, which he called the ""long concrete path."" Steinbeck's wife, Carol, suggested the title of the book (in which he called Route 66 ""the Mother Road""). She was inspired by ""the Battle Hymn of the Republic."" The song's first verse reads: ""Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored."" Oktoberfest close to home . The book's English-language title translated into foreign-edition titles such as ""Angry Grapes"" in Germany and ""Rage of Grapes"" in Japan. 3. Of the 116 episodes in the 1960-1964 TV show ""route 66"" (yes, always spelled with a lower-case ""r"") only two episodes were actually filmed on Route 66. The cast and crew moved on location to 81 U.S. communities in 23 states. They also made two side trips to Canada, to film episodes in Toronto and Niagara Falls. Of the two destinations on Route 66 that were part of the series, one is in Needles, California, and the other is on a pre-1937 Route 66 stretch near Santa Fe, New Mexico. 4. Route 66 is the only national highway to be decommissioned from the original 1926 grid that created the U.S. Highways System. It all came to a head on October 13, 1984, when a new, efficient six-mile freeway heading west at Williams, Arizona, opened to traffic. That's when the last portion of Route 66 was bypassed by the interstates. Because of the new freeway, Highway 40 no longer intersected with Route 66. It now arched away from ""the old road"" and ended any necessity for motorists to travel on Route 66 to get between Chicago and L.A. How the world welcomed fall (or spring) The town of Williams had negotiated three interstate off-ramps to ensure travelers had access to their services. In return, Williams today is a wonderful place to experience Route 66 memorabilia and gain a sense of the road's history (and it is also gateway to the Grand Canyon). With Williams bypassed, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials voted in favor of the ""Elimination of U.S. Route 66"" on June 26, 1985. 5. Bobby Troup met Nat King Cole within days of Troup and his wife Cynthia arriving in Los Angeles, after the couple's February 1946 drive across the country, part of it on Route 66. The Troups had driven U.S. Highway 40 from their Philadelphia home to St. Louis, where they in fact did motor west on U.S. Highway 66. Inspired by Cynthia's suggestion of ""Get your kicks on Route 66"" as a song title, Troup had written less than half of ""(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66"" when he met Cole. Troup sat at Cole's piano at the Trocadero Club on Sunset Boulevard and played his half-song for the first time. Cole liked it so much he joined Troup and played along. Cole told Troup to finish the song and committed to recording it for his upcoming album. We dare you to take a real vacation . Bobby and Cynthia got out their AAA maps to help frame the next verse, concentrating on their overnight stops. Cynthia said years later, ""What I really can't believe is that he doesn't have Albuquerque in the song."" Kansas is the only one of the Route 66 states Troup did not reference, while Winona -- for reasons of rhyme -- is the one place out of driving sequence. Keeping his word, Cole recorded the song on March 16, 1946. Its popularity soared. And the Rolling Stones recorded it for their first album. 6. Route 66 has had many nicknames, such as ""America's Main Street,"" and ""the Road of Dreams."" But Route 66 is properly co-designated ""the Will Rogers Highway."" Rogers, who spent his younger years in and around Route 66 communities, was the most widely read newspaper writer of his time and by 1933 he was the top male box-office draw in the United States movie industry, becoming ""honorary mayor"" of Beverly Hills. When he died in a 1935 plane crash, radio stations in many parts of the country went silent for 30 minutes out of respect for their most quoted broadcaster. While the highway signage for this designation seems sporadic, it is official. A wonderful tribute to the man and his times is the Will Rogers Memorial Museum located in Claremore, just outside of Tulsa. 7. Oklahoma's Cyrus Avery, ""the father of Route 66,"" was so confident his proposed road from Chicago to L.A. would be designated ""Highway 60"" that he printed 60,000 brochures promoting Highway 60 going through his state in 1926. Avery began erecting Highway 60 road signs along Oklahoma's state road. (Of course, all of these had to be destroyed when the U.S. Highway 66 designation was stipulated later that year.) The decision by Avery and his compatriots to accept ""66"" as their favored route's designation was made in Springfield, Missouri, on April 30, 1926, giving that town recognition as ""the birthplace of Route 66.""

"(CNN) -- The story of Ahmad al-Shayea is the story of all that has been wrong -- and continues to be wrong -- with the United States and our allies' campaign against Islamist extremism. During 2004, Ahmad had fought for Al Qaeda in Iraq against the United States. Indeed, he became famous as the first suicide bomber in Iraq to survive his attack. Known as the ""living suicide,"" Ahmad was rehabilitated, both physically and mentally, at a U.S. Army hospital before being repatriated to his home country of Saudi Arabia. I met Ahmad at the Saudi government center also designed to rehabilitate jihadi militants. Ahmad and I became friends. We spent several days together and continued a correspondence for years after I left Saudi Arabia, until Ahmad went back to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State (ISIS). Ahmad had been the poster child of the ""reformed"" jihadi. He told me of his fondness for the American doctors and medics who nursed him back to health after suffering extensive burns from his bomb attack. Given ample funds and help finding a job by the Saudi government, everything was seemingly taken care of; Ahmad was a terrorist no more. But what both the Saudis and Americans who tried to ""rehabilitate"" Ahmad never addressed was the only thing that mattered to him. And that was his deep and abiding religious belief. Above all else, Ahmad wanted to be a good Muslim, devout and steadfast to the principles of Islam. Many Muslims consider being a martyr in holy war --going to heaven to fight for the faithful -- the purest path to the truest faith. When the war in Syria and now Iraq began again, it was Ahmad's faith that drove him. He is not alone. Among young Muslims in the Middle East, South Asia and even the West, their faith has become a race to the fundamentalist finish line. Whoever offers the purest Islam -- the real and most devout faith these young men seek -- will win the race. No amount of jobs, money or friendship with Americans matters. And no amount of American military force will ultimately matter either. Take the story of Ahmad again. The United States defeated him and his group Al Qaeda in Iraq some seven years ago. Ahmad was even the paragon of a successfully rehabilitated terrorist. And here we are fighting the same group again, for ISIS is largely Al Qaeda in Iraq reconstituted and re-energized, with Ahmad and many men like him their holy warriors once more. What can the United States do? We must first recognize that this is not primarily a war between the United States and radical Islam. It is a war within Islam itself for the soul of the faith. Until Muslims and Islamic religious authorities in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere can offer a true and convincing vision of Islam to young men such as Ahmad, we will lose the battle for their souls. This is not an American government battle. By making it so, the U.S. government will continue this fight for years, if not decades, as President Obama concedes. An effective response against extremism can only come from Muslims themselves. What can the U.S. do? We are not powerless. Whenever American national security is directly threatened, a limited use of American military power can be warranted, but only if is secondary and in support of effective local Muslim governments and local forces in the region. We cannot lead, as the President is undertaking now. We can, however, help to expose the feckless nature of the radicals. In 2011, U.S. authorities killed the radical Islamist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki with a drone strike in Yemen. Al-Awlaki allegedly inspired the Boston Marathon bombers. If the United States had disseminated the facts about Awlaki instead -- the cleric had been arrested for soliciting prostitutes in San Diego, a violation of Islamic precepts -- that may have accomplished more to discredit his religious standing among young men looking for an example of Islam than turning him into a martyr. Similarly, of the more than 100 Islamist radicals I've interviewed, the most prevalent reason they expressed for leaving the radical cause was its ""un-Islamic ways."" Corruption being the key. Exposing the illicit oil trade of the Taliban, as well as its smuggling and narcotics trafficking could do more to defeat the group than all the drones in the world. But while the United States can help expose their corruption, it must be up to Muslims themselves to expose how and why their ideas are not the true and purest Islam. Thirteen years after 9/11, it's time America wakes up. This is not our war. Let's stop fighting it. Ahmad al-Shayea tells us no less.","Ken Ballen: Ahmad al-Shayea's story shows what's wrong with campaign against extremists .

"(CNN) -- Part of Robert Ferrante's job had been to manage a laboratory that conducted clinical trials using various drugs and chemicals. Until he was accused of using one of those substances -- cyanide -- to kill his wife. On Friday, a Pennsylvania jury determined that this accusation was well founded, convicting the University of Pittsburgh medical researcher and professor of murder in death of 41-year-old Autumn Klein. As juror Helen Ewing told reporters afterward, ""It was very hard for me to accept and to believe that he could have done it. ""But I felt that the facts were clear, and I couldn't argue with them."" For many on the outside, there seemed little amiss in the lives of Ferrante and Klein. They both had successful careers, including Klein as a top neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Their house was brightened by Klein's then-6-year-old daughter, Cianna. And they'd just returned from a trip to Puerto Rico. ""I've never seen anything to suggest they were anything but a happy couple with a beautiful little girl,"" their neighbor Blithe Runsdorf said. Then, on April 17, 2013, Ferrante called 911 and said his wife was ""conscious and breathing, but not alert"" inside their Pittsburgh home. ""Please, please, please,"" he said. ""... I think my wife is having a stroke."" When paramedics arrived, they found Klein on the floor of the kitchen with a plastic bag containing creatine. She died three days later. According to a criminal complaint, several text messages sent between the couple suggest Ferrante urged Klein to try using creatine to get help her get pregnant. Whatever Ferrante's rationale, there's no scientific consensus that creatine supplements -- which some use to build muscle mass and may have medical value -- help with female fertility; in fact, the National Institutes of Health says pregnant women should not use creatine. Regardless, authorities say it wasn't the creatine that killed Klein -- but rather cyanide that had been mixed with it. One day before Klein fell ill, Ferrante had used a credit card to place an overnight order for more than a half-pound of cyanide. At the time the order was placed, there were no active projects at Ferrante's lab that involved the use of cyanide, according to the complaint. And when investigators looked at the bottle, they found that over 8 grams of cyanide were missing from it. Cyanide is often used in research laboratories for experiments. In humans, in which it interferes with a body's ability to use oxygen to produce energy, it can be deadly. In July 2013, Ferrante was charged in his late wife's death, arrested in West Virginia, then extradited back to Pennsylvania. Accused professor waives extradition . And why did Autumn Klein die? More than a week after her collapse, after being told that she'd been fatally poisoned with cyanide, Ferrante himself asked detectives, ""Why would she do that to herself?"" A few seconds later, according to the complaint, he added: ""Who would do this to her?"" Another neighbor of the couple, who asked not to be identified, said it was no secret that Klein wanted another baby. But she told the neighbor's wife Ferrante did not share that desire. The criminal complaint raises another source of friction: Ferrante confronted his wife three times within weeks of her death about whether or not she was having an affair. ""Further, evidence has been uncovered that reflects that the victim intended to have a conversation with Ferrante and Ferrante would 'not like the discussion,'"" the complaint adds. The case lingered for months, before finally going to trial in October. Dozens of witnesses took the stand, perhaps none more key than Ferrante himself. His lawyer, Bill Difenderfer, said after the verdict that he thought his client ""did extremely well"" on the stand. ""I thought he was very candid ... and he was telling the truth."" Yet, rather than be convinced of his innocence, jurors said that inconsistencies in his testimony played a significant role in their guilty verdict. ""I think he has excellent coaches,"" Ewing said. ""I think he had a year to think about the story he wanted to tell."" Difenderfer said that it's going to take time to review the ""80-plus search warrants, multitudes of evidence (and) terabytes of information"" before deciding on the defense team's next steps, including a possible appeal. Klein's parents, meanwhile, returned home to care for young Cianna and cherish the memories of the girl's late mother. ""While we are pleased that the person responsible for Autumn's death has been brought to justice,"" the parents said in a statement, ""nothing will ever fill the emptiness that we feel in our family and in our hearts."" CNN's Carma Hassan and Julia Lull contributed to this report.","A Pennsylvania jury convicts Robert Ferrante of murder in his wife's death .

"(CNN) -- It's a woman's most intimate piece of apparel and many women will admit that shopping for one can be a nightmare. One company is using technology to take the guess work out of buying the perfect bra. Michelle Lam and her company, True & Co, are using data to build a better bra in a smarter way. Lam, founder of the San Francisco-based company which launched in 2012, spoke to Smart Business about how to avoid awkward fittings. CNN: How does your online bra fitting service work? Michelle Lam: A True & Co woman comes to the site and she actually takes a very simple quiz with illustrations. We ask questions, like what is the shape of your breast, what size bra do you currently wear. While she's going through that, our algorithm and technology is doing a bunch of really complicated things behind the scenes, drumming up the exact recommendations and best matches for this woman. As soon as she reaches what we call her 'personal shop', all she sees are the sizes and styles of bras that are the best match for her. She then orders her bras from us and can try them on at home. And then, we collect even more data from her when she tells us which she likes and fit her best, and which she's going to return. The fit quiz is our way to size women into the perfect bra for them, without any measuring tape, any photos, or any fitting rooms. CNN: More than 1 million women have taken the fit quiz. What has your data found? ML: We translate the data into a 'true spectrum' -- a way for women to understand the results of their quiz. When we looked at 22 million pieces of data about a woman's body and her life, we discovered something really extraordinary. First of all, we were expecting a couple of hundred different body types. We actually found over 6,000 different body types, each nuanced and each different in a unique way. The fit quiz and algorithm successfully fits eight in 10 women. CNN: Some women may have concerns about buying something as personal as a bra online. How will you remove the risk factor? ML: After a woman's first purchase, we may not get it right the first time. We may only get one in five right, or two in five right. And she may keep those. But she'll tell us what didn't work about the other ones she returned. And of course, we do free shipping and free returns, so that ensures that the whole equation is risk-free. We take that data from her and we actually refine the selections in her shop, so that her recommendations get better and better throughout time. CNN: How can your service change the way we shop? ML: What we're doing with the algorithm and the data is a complete innovation in the intimate apparel space. And intimate apparel is a massive market. But what we're actually doing can be applied to all of apparel and in fact all of shopping. We're not just telling you how many blue bras have been sold, which is what old retail would do. We're doing something completely different and new. We're telling you who is buying that blue bra and not only that, but why they're buying the bra. We're in the business of deciphering what women want, and when you know what women want, you can actually change all of shopping.

"(CNN) -- Michelle Obama met privately Thursday with victims and surviving family members of the mass shooting at a Wisconsin Sikh temple earlier this month. The shooting -- which left six people dead and four others wounded -- occurred August 5 at a gurdwara, or Sikh house of worship, in Oak Creek. The gunman, identified by police as 40-year-old Army veteran Wade Michael Page, later killed himself. On Thursday, the first lady first met with the gurdwara secretary, Kulwant Singh Dhaliwal, and Mayor Stephen Scaffidi in the hallway of Oak Creek High School. Sikhs speak to long-held fears in their community . ""It's my honor to be here with you,"" Obama told them, according to a pool report. ""I'm sorry it's under these circumstances, but I am anxious to meet with the families and lend whatever support I can."" One of the survivors Obama met was Santokh Singh, who was released from the hospital last week. He underwent two surgeries after suffering a gunshot wound that penetrated his chest, diaphragm, stomach and liver. ""He can hardly walk or stand because of the stitches, but we're going,"" said his nephew, Gurjeet Singh. At service, Holder calls temple shooting a hate crime . Dhaliwal did not attend the meeting with families, but said he was touched by Obama's concern. ""It was very graceful of her. It means a lot to us,"" he said. Five men -- Suveg Singh, 84; Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65; Ranjit Singh, 49; Sita Singh, 41; Prakash Singh, 39 -- and a woman, 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur, were killed by Page.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Coptic Pope Shenouda III, the spiritual leader of Egypt's Coptic Christian community for nearly four decades, died Saturday, according to the head of the Egyptian General Coptic Association. He was 88. ""Shenouda III suffered renal failure ... due to the diabetes he endured for years,"" Sheif Doss told CNN. The leader of the Coptic Christian community for 38 years, Shenouda was in poor health off and on for many years. He traveled to the United States to undergo medical tests last year. Egypt's population is roughly 9% Coptic Christian, according to the U.S. State Department. The Christian minority has been the target of a number of high-profile attacks in the past several years, including the bombing of a major church in Alexandria last January that left at least 21 people dead. ""The funeral is expected to take place in two days, as massive preparations must take place first. It is a historical event and 2 million people are expected to attend the prayers. I don't expect violence though,"" Doss said. Markus Askuf, spokesman for the Coptic Church, said Shenouda's body is expected to arrive at the Coptic cathedral in Cairo at noon Sunday. Visitors will be permitted to come and pray there. Shenouda will be buried Tuesday at Emba Bishoy monastery in Wadi Natroun, northwest of Egypt's capital, Askuf said. The area is home to some of the world's earliest Christian monasteries. The Coptic Orthodox Church is the largest Christian church in the Middle East, according the Coptic Orthodox Church Centre in Stevenage, England.

When a Coptic pope dies, all 150 bishops of the church's Holy Council appoint an acting patriarch until a vote is conducted for a successor, Doss said. Thousands of bishops, priests and monks are eligible to vote. The most senior bishop usually takes the role of acting patriarch. In this case, that would be Bishop Michael of Asiut. If he declines, Bishop Bakhamious of Behira is next in line, Doss said.","NEW: Pope Shenouda III is to be buried Tuesday, a spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- [WARNING: The following contains spoilers for the ""Doctor Who"" season finale.] . Permission to squee? Saturday night's ""Doctor Who"" season finale was a roller coaster of feels, with deaths, goodbyes and one incredible James Bond-esque move by the Doctor. It was the end of the first season of Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor. Here are five moments that had us cheering or reaching for the tissues: . 1. The Master kills Osgood . This one really hurt. UNIT captured the Master and made the Doctor the president of Earth, as they faced a massive invasion by dead-people-turned-Cybermen. The Master tried the old talking-to-your-captor trick to bowtie-wearing geek Osgood (""Bowties are cool,"" after all), telling Osgood that she was about to be killed within 60 seconds. Unfortunately for Osgood, the Master was no longer handcuffed and made good on her promise. It was part of a terrific nutso performance by Michelle Gomez as the Master, but we'll really miss Osgood, who was like the ultimate ""Doctor Who"" fan. 2. Windsurfing into the TARDIS . The plane that carried the Doctor and members of UNIT exploded, and the Doctor was sent flying out of it, about to crash to the ground. Was this how it would all end? Instead, the Doctor spotted the TARDIS and aimed himself to land right inside it. Wow! The Master's AI interface assistant Seb was quite impressed by this, but the Master destroyed him as he squeed. 3. Clara reunites with Danny . After talking her way out of being killed by the Cybermen by impersonating the Doctor, Clara found herself in a graveyard, and discovered that an approaching Cyberman was her late boyfriend, Danny, who still had emotions, but was begging her to switch them off. The Doctor arrived in time to tell her not to do it, but the Master did as well. After a heart-wrenching exchange among all of them, Danny and Clara said one last goodbye, as Clara took his sonic screwdriver and aimed it right at him, making him emotionless. However, he was able to take control of the Cybermen and fly them away, blowing themselves up and foiling the Master's plan. 4. Kate Stewart's father kills the Master . Clara was determined to kill the Master, but she turned over the Master's vaporizing remote control over to the Doctor, but then the Master was vaporized by someone else: the Cyberman version of the Doctor's old friend, UNIT's Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. Poetic justice. 5. Clara's goodbye . Two weeks later, when Clara (Jenna Coleman) was awakened by a portal from the afterlife, she heard from Danny, who sacrificed his one chance to return to life by returning the young boy he had accidentally killed while he was a soldier. Clara and the Doctor later met at a restaurant, where she broke the news to him that she couldn't travel with him any longer. He assumed it was because she was back together with Danny, and she wouldn't tell him otherwise. The Doctor had news for her as well: The Master gave him the coordinates for Gallifrey and he found it. But we saw the reality: It wasn't there, and the Doctor destroyed the TARDIS' control panel in frustration. Clara hugged the Doctor, something he never likes doing, and told him, ""Doctor, traveling with you made me feel really special. Thank you for that. Thank you for making me feel special."" He thanked her for the same. Don't mind us, we've got something in our eye. Capaldi's message to grieving boy . But it wasn't over: The Doctor got a visit from Santa Claus, played by Nick Frost. What does the Christmas special hold for us? Fans on Twitter had a lot to say about this finale, and they had mixed feelings. ""It's one of Moffat's trickiest finales ever,"" tweeted Andy Behbakht. ""While he wrapped up Series 8 in a pleasing way, I felt something big was missing."" ""I have so many feels right now,"" said @GoodnightGoldie. ""Loved it! Can't wait for, can't believe I'm saying it...Christmas!"" Franklin Harris summed it up as ""A thrilling conclusion to an uneven season that showed the strengths and weaknesses of producer Steven Moffat's fairytale approach."" ""I just don't even know what to do with myself,"" admitted Kendall Ashley. ""That ending was tragic, and Clara and the Doctor NEED each other right now!"" What did you think? Share your comments below.","""Doctor Who"" ended its eighth season (and first with Peter Capaldi) with an emotional finale .

"Editor's note: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the former lieutenant governor of Maryland and daughter of late U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, is a former U.S. deputy assistant attorney general and serves on the board of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. She is a Democrat. Paul Helmke, the former mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana, is a Republican and president of the Brady Campaign. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend says the bloody Mexican drug war is being fueled by American guns. (CNN) -- America's neighbor to the south is engaged in a bloody war with ruthless drug cartels. It is a war that is threatening to bring down the government of Mexico, is spilling over into neighborhoods in the United States and is fast becoming a serious national security concern. American gun sellers supply the cartels with 95 to 100 percent of their guns, according to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. While the Mexican drug war has the media and Washington abuzz, there has been little mention of our role in supplying the terrorists: We need to realize that the Mexican drug cartels are arming themselves here because our gun laws have loopholes so large that criminals and gun traffickers can easily drive gun-laden trucks through them. Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora correctly called American gun laws ""absurd."" This crisis is not happening because our border is loose. It is happening because our gun laws allow guns to be sold by unlicensed sellers without background checks required by the Brady Bill, military-style assault weapons to be freely sold and corrupt gun dealers to thrive. We need to prevent Mexican criminals and the traffickers who supply them from buying guns by changing our gun laws and strengthening U.S. law enforcement's ability to crack down on corrupt gun dealers. Although it is urgent that we help stem the violence in Mexico, we must realize that the same legal loopholes and corrupt gun sellers that help arm Mexican criminals also arm American criminals. We should heed the call of Mexican officials to help stop the violence there, but we also should heed the call of the vast majority of Americans to stop the violence in their communities. Proposals from Washington have ignored these central points, instead focusing on border issues, enforcement of current laws and a possible federal ban on assault weapons. Though helpful, those proposals do not address some other fundamental weaknesses of our gun laws. If we want to help the Mexican people and our own, we must eliminate the loopholes and gaps in federal law that allow guns to be sold without Brady background checks by unlicensed sellers. The ATF has found that gun sales without background checks are a major source for supplying dangerous people with guns. Under current federal law, only gun sales by a federally licensed gun dealer are subject to Brady background checks. ""Private sales"" by unlicensed sellers don't require a background check. At gun shows -- sort of like flea markets for firearms -- so-called private sellers sell guns to anyone, no questions asked, except in states that have closed this loophole under state law. Texas and Arizona continue to allow private sellers to sell without background checks, and gun shows in those states are one of the sources of guns recovered in Mexico. Mexican drug cartels are exploiting this loophole. We all agree that criminals should not be allowed to buy guns. We should also agree that all gun sellers should check to make sure they are not arming criminals. There is more we should do. We must get rid of the riders, known collectively as the Tiahrt Amendment, attached annually to Justice Department appropriations legislation since 2004. These riders weaken enforcement of our laws by prohibiting the ATF from releasing gun crime gun data to law enforcement and others, prohibiting the ATF from requiring gun dealer inventory audits and requiring the destruction of critical Brady background check records within only 24 hours. We also should further strengthen the ATF by making it easier to revoke the licenses of reckless dealers, give it the power to suspend licenses and levy civil penalties, and eliminate the bizarre restriction that limits the ATF to only one spot inspection of a gun dealer per year. In addition to strengthening the ATF's enforcement power, we need to attack gun trafficking at its source by limiting the high-volume gun sales that fuel trafficking from licensed dealers. Under federal law, there is no limit to how many handguns or assault weapons a purchaser can buy at a time, allowing gun traffickers to quickly amass guns suitable for an army. Every year, 30,000 Americans are killed with guns, but all too often, Washington has ignored the pleas of the vast majority of Americans calling for sanity in our gun laws. Politicians frequently echo the gun lobby refrain to only ""enforce the laws on the books,"" refusing to admit that there are very few laws on the books. But the Mexican drug war has upped the ante. Now that our weak gun laws threaten the stability of an important ally, fueling one of our nation's most ominous global security threats, the question is whether we will strengthen our gun laws to protect Mexicans, and Americans, or whether we will cater to the extremist gun lobby. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and Paul Helmke.","Townsend, Helmke: U.S. guns are helping fuel the Mexican drug war .

"(CNN) -- As Faith Gonsalves walks through the dusty streets of a slum on the outskirts of New Delhi, she passes pigs rummaging through piles of trash, and colorful saris hanging out to dry. In a nearby doorway, a girl and a boy sit with furrowed brows. The 26-year-old is on her way to a makeshift classroom, where she runs regular music workshops for the community's children. Once inside, the expressions on the faces of her skinny pupils couldn't be more different than those worn by the pair outside. The children sing, their bright eyes fixed on Gonsalves, as three musicians accompany them with a ukulele, keyboard and rhythm eggs. India is home to some of the richest but also some of the poorest people in the world. The country has the sixth-largest population of billionaires worldwide, and yet more than 300 million Indians, or around a quarter of the population, lives on $1.25 or less a day, according to the World Bank. The children who live in the low-income communities of New Delhi's sprawling metropolis have more worries than most -- poverty, malnutrition, disease -- but above all, says Gonsalves, they feel an overwhelming sense of powerlessness. In 2008, Gonsalves founded Music Basti, an arts education program that seeks to inspire New Delhi's underprivileged children to share their dreams and aspirations through music, and teaches them important life skills that they may not get from formal schooling. ""Music is a really powerful way of communicating and it's a really powerful equalizer,"" she says. ""It also brings with it a whole host of learning and developmental benefits -- whether it's learning math and rhythm, learning language and singing, or learning how to work together with other children."" Over the last six years, the program has worked with at least 600 young people -- children who, Gonsalves says, would never have a chance otherwise to hold a public platform or stand on a stage. Her goal is to raise awareness of the importance of creative learning for children's development, especially for the so-called ""at risk"" children, such as orphans, abuse victims, and beggars, that Music Basti supports. More than 200 musicians and artists have contributed to the program, and yet persuading teachers to make a long-term commitment to working with these communities can be as challenging as raising funds, Gonsalves says. ""Music and arts are often relegated from the education system as much as the people we work with and the communities that live on the fringes of the city,"" she says. But attitudes in New Delhi are gradually changing, and with them, the lives of the children are transforming too. ""The biggest positive change that we see in the children, and the communities that we work in, is ... how learning music and performing music gives children a sense of achievement but also of confidence, and that goes a huge way in many other aspects and areas of their lives."" Last year, the students wrote and recorded an album, and held a concert in the center of Delhi in front of 500 people. Around 170 children are taking part in the program this year. Music has played an important role in Gonsalves' own life. She grew up listening to her mother sing old folk songs, and her brother is now a professional pianist. Gonsalves was heavily involved in music at school and as a student at Delhi University. Her deep belief in the transformative power of music is the source of her passion for the work she does now. ""Seeing the program in action, it's always deeply encouraging and deeply motivating, especially to see children enjoying the process of learning, not being afraid by it,"" she says. ""But it also reminds me that we have a really long way to go in trying to take this model of education to many, many more children in our city, but also in our country.""","Faith Gonsalves, 26, founded a music and arts program for underprivileged children in Delhi .
Gonsalves: Music is a powerful tool for children's development; raises awareness of poverty .
Delhi's formal education system has gaps when it comes to music and arts, she says .
In six years, at least 600 children and 200 musicians have participated in the program ."
"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has endorsed same-sex marriage. Will it make any difference to the battle for marriage equality? The news coming out of North Carolina suggests not. The Tar Heelers on Tuesday voted 61% to 39% to amend their constitution to outlaw same-sex marriage. Actually, they've gone much further. The new amendment prohibits any kind of same-sex unions, including the relatively innocuous option of civil partnership. So radical is the measure that gay rights groups hoped this vote might prove to be a replay of last year's surprise result in Mississippi, when voters rejected an amendment banning abortions because its language and consequences were considered too extreme. But now we know the limits of the South's social liberalism: yes to abortions, no to same-sex weddings. There's a popular myth that social liberalism is unstoppable. But the tide of progress is a myth. Societies have often taken a step forward only to stand perfectly still or even take a couple of steps back. In hindsight, the journey of black civil rights looks like a brisk jog in a straight line, but it was really a winding stumble. The ecstasy of emancipation was followed by the misery of segregation. And although legal segregation was defeated, some would argue that it still continues. The story of women's rights demonstrates that sometimes social liberalism can politically overreach itself. In the 1970s, feminists seemed to win every battle they fought on abortion, hiring practices or school sports. They believed that ultimate victory would be secured with passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, which would amend the Constitution to outlaw discrimination with regard to sex. Victory seemed assured. The ERA sailed through Congress in 1972 and was endorsed by President Richard Nixon. It required the ratification of 38 states to pass, and by the end of 1973 it had 30. But then the ERA faced the same problem that same-sex marriage faces today: the sustained assault of America's social conservatives. The right saw the ERA as an assault on the traditional family. They feared it would force women to work in heavy labor or fight in the Army, and many worried that it could even lead to same-sex marriage. As conservatives poured dollars into stopping ratification, more and more states either refused to ratify or rescinded. The ERA hit a geographic boundary in the South and could go no further. Failing to reach its 38 ratifications, it faded away. News: Obama supports same-sex marriage . It wasn't just the money that killed the ERA; supporters often outspent opponents. The amendment failed because the right turned it into a ""line in the sand"" issue, a matter on which Americans could say that they were happy for society to progress this far but no further. The same goes for same-sex marriage. It's true that growing numbers of Americans say they support marriage equality, but then everyone lies to police officers, priests and pollsters. In every state that has held a popular vote on same-sex marriage, it has been defeated (that even includes Maine). Take a look at a map of where it has been passed by state legislatures and you'll see that it's limited to the bits of the country that overwhelmingly vote Democratic. Crucially, while America is trending Democratic in demographic terms -- as the nonwhite proportion of the population increases -- this doesn't translate into growing support for gay rights. On the contrary, the energy behind the amendment in North Carolina came from African-American churches, many of them deeply offended by the comparison between the struggle for emancipation and the campaign for same-sex marriage. Likewise, Obama's victory in 2008 drew to the polls the same African-Americans and Latinos who simultaneously voted for Proposition 8 in California, outlawing same-sex marriage in the state. Opinion: In GOP, support for same-sex marriage is growing . Increasingly, gay rights isn't a partisan issue; the battle lines are drawn by class rather than political allegiance. For middle-class whites, supporting same-sex marriage is a test of tolerance that, coincidentally, distances them from the fundamentalist rabble who live down the street. For many African-Americans, Latinos and poor whites, it's a matter of faith vs. Hollywood values. Given how controversial it is, same-sex marriage could go the way of the ERA -- a reform too far, joining the long list of Democratic, election-time promises that no one ever expects to see realized. And given that he offers no new policies on the subject (he can't: It's a classic states rights issue), Obama's endorsement is little more than kind words. They are brave words in that seven out of the nine swing states he's contesting in November have constitutional amendments outlawing same-sex marriage -- most of them passed by popular referenda. ""The folks,"" as Bill O'Reilly calls middle America, don't like it. Does the futility of Obama's gesture, or the problems faced by same-sex marriage, mean it's game over for gay rights? Not at all. The failure of the ERA did not retard women's rights in any significant way. While the failure of same-sex marriage might have legal consequences for couples, it doesn't mean that the Westboro Baptist Church has won. On the contrary, Vice President Joe Biden accidentally got something right on Sunday when he said that American attitudes toward sexuality had been forever altered by the TV sitcom ""Will and Grace."" On a cultural level, homosexuality is now a fact of life in modern America. People work with gays and lesbians, have them in their family, sit next to them in church, and, most importantly of all, see them on television. That degree of acculturation can never be undone, even by the ballot box. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley .","Tim Stanley: The N.C. vote to ban same-sex marriage goes far, includes civil partnerships .
He says socially liberal initiatives often move slowly -- the Equal Rights Amendment, for example .
He says ERA became a line in the sand for the right; too few states ended up supporting it .
Stanley: Black, Latino opposition doesn't help the same-sex marriage issue ."
"(CNN) -- Eric Holder, who resigned Thursday, kicked off his stormy tenure as attorney general with a challenge to the American public that set the tone for his six turbulent years as the nation's top law-enforcement officer. ""Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot, in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards,"" said Holder in his first public speech after being sworn in. When the remark drew an uproar from conservatives, Holder shrugged and doubled down. ""I wouldn't walk away from that speech,"" Holder told ABC News. ""I think we are still a nation that is too afraid to confront racial issues,"" rarely engaging ""one another across the color line [to] talk about racial issues."" And true to form, Holder -- a tall man who carries himself with the relaxed, quiet confidence of a corporate attorney -- seldom backed down from a confrontation, on racial justice or other issues. He pressed Credit Suisse, and the Swiss bank eventually paid over $2.6 billion to settle claims it was illegally helping wealthy Americans avoid paying taxes. Holder took the lead in pushing banks and other financial companies involved in the mortgage crisis to pay $25 billion to federal and state governments, a record civil settlement. And Holder famously sparred with members of Congress such as Darrell Issa and Louie Gohmert as the television cameras rolled. In one heated exchange at a Judiciary Committee hearing in 2013, Issa and Holder talked over each other, with the attorney general concluding, ""That is inappropriate and is too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of Congress. It's unacceptable, and it's shameful."" In another back-and-forth, Holder trash-talked Gohmert with lines that could have been taken from a comedy routine. ""You don't want to go there, buddy. You don't want to go there, OK?"" While the history books will note Holder was the first African-American attorney general, a more relevant biographical fact might be his status as possibly the first attorney general who, as a college student protester, occupied a campus building: In 1969, as a freshman at Columbia University, Holder was part of a group of black students that took over a former naval ROTC office for five days, demanding that it be renamed the Malcolm X Lounge. (In a sign of the times, the university complied.) Echoes of Holder's activist history could be heard years later, in the middle of a high-stakes battle with leaders of several Southern states over voter-ID laws and other rules changes that Holder deemed at attack on black voting rights. ""People should understand that there's steel here, and I am resolved to oppose any attempts to try to roll back the clock,"" Holder told CNN's Jeffrey Toobin in an article for The New Yorker. Not all of Holder's crusades have worked out well. The Supreme Court, despite Holder's efforts, voted to strike down key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, and conservative senators blocked Debo Adegbile, Holder's preferred choice to run the Civil Rights division of the Justice Department. The attorney general has launched or joined legal battles against restrictions on voting rights in Ohio, Wisconsin, Texas and North Carolina, but it's unclear whether those efforts will end up back at the same Supreme Court that weakened the original law. In 2012, House Republicans voted to hold the attorney general in contempt of Congress for stonewalling on information requests in the bungled Fast and Furious gun-smuggling operation in which 2,000 weapons went missing. It was the first time in U.S. history that a sitting Cabinet member was given such a severe sanction. (The case will continue after Holder's resignation, although his successor will inherit the fallout, not Holder personally.) But history will surely judge Holder a success at broadly expanding access to justice for groups seeking acceptance and fairness. He announced the federal government would no longer defend laws banning same-sex marriage and told state attorneys general they could do the same. And Holder made good on his initial commitment to change the conversation on race. He traveled to Ferguson, Missouri, and assigned dozens of Justice Department personnel to investigate law enforcement practices after the police killing of Michael Brown triggered street riots. He has also called for voting rights to be restored to formerly incarcerated Americans, and pressed for a reduction in the prosecution of low-level marijuana users. For one clue about how history will regard Holder, go back to 2009. In the effort to battle terrorism, Holder called for five accused terrorist suspected of participating in the 9/11 attacks to be tried in federal courts in New York -- only to see the proposal scuttled after a political uproar. ""We need not cower in the face of this enemy,"" Holder told skeptical members of the Senate. They didn't buy the argument, but it was classic Holder: Once again, the battler leaping into the arena and daring others to summon the nerve to fight alongside him.","Errol Louis: Eric Holder, who has resigned, had bold stormy tenure from start as AG .
Louis: Holder took heat for saying nation cowardly on racial issues. Stood by remarks .
He confronted banks, won tax case settlements, sparred with Issa, fought voter ID laws .
Louis: He was first AG House held in contempt. He was a fighter, dared others to join him ."
"(CNN) -- After the September 11 attacks, a New York firefighter took a series of photographs capturing the destruction. Eleven years later, Superstorm Sandy damaged the photographs as they sat in the basement of his Queens home. Partially destroyed, the photographs encapsulate two traumatic events burned in the minds of New Yorkers. The firefighter, Michael Redpath, now has his photos on display in an installation called ""Residual Images"" in Manhattan. Redpath, a 15-year veteran of the city fire department, was off duty September 11, 2001, and was called in that afternoon. One of hundreds of emergency responders, he was stunned by what he found upon arriving at ground zero. ""It was like a nuclear winter. It was very quiet. Everything was covered with fine white dust. It looked like a black-and-white photograph,"" Redpath said. Redpath had brought his camera, and recognizing the magnitude of the attacks, he began snapping shots of the wreckage. ""I was just trying to convey the scale, which is almost impossible to do,"" he said. Having studied photography, some images jumped out at Redpath over the months he spent at ground zero. He was most struck by the efforts of police officers, firemen, iron workers and crane operators, he said. Redpath developed some of the photos and stored the negatives in a box in the basement of his home in the Rockaways section of Queens. Redpath initially considered showing the photographs for the 10th anniversary of 9/11. But a decade later, he just wasn't ready. Last year, when Superstorm Sandy slammed into the East Coast, Redpath's home, including the basement housing his 9/11 pictures, suffered extensive flood damage. Redpath likened it to losing family photos. A family member later scanned the negatives and gave them to Redpath as a gift. They were altered but not ruined. ""It was almost like a whole other layer, destruction on destruction. The new images were haunting in their own respect,"" Redpath said . The New York Times' Niko Koppel curated the show with the OSMOS Address, an exhibition space. The show is on display at Manhattan's First Street Green through Tuesday, the anniversary of Sandy hitting New York, described the photographs as ""arresting."" The outdoor exhibit is situated between two buildings and features more than 100 of Redpath's images projected onto two large screens in 15-minute increments. One image shows piles of rubble and collapsed iron, and Sandy's murky floodwater added what appear to be superimposed black clouds. Another photo of a firefighter standing, back to the camera, before the World Trade Center rubble at ground zero has scratches and water damage that give the picture a smoky, three-dimensional feel. On Sunday, passersby stopped to take a look, some briefly, while others sat for longer spells, mesmerized as they were reminded of the tragedies. ""It is very powerful. The juxtaposition of the two gets really interesting,"" said a neighborhood woman. Said another man who walked cautiously toward the projections, ""It brings up bad memories.""","Firefighter's negatives from 9/11 ground zero damaged by Superstorm Sandy's flooding .

"Fort Bragg, North Carolina (CNN) -- There's plenty of grunting and groaning during the early morning workouts in the gym at the JFK Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. But suddenly among the young men in special forces units doing pull-ups and lifting weights, there are dozens of young female troops -- running an obstacle course, pushing and pulling hundreds of pounds of kettlebells, running laps. These women are part of a groundbreaking and controversial program that for the first time is selecting, training and assigning women to join up with special forces units in Afghanistan. Their job: to do what the men cannot. In the socially conservative Afghan culture where the sexes do not mix, these women are on the front line of dealing directly with Afghan women and children. So-called female engagement teams, or ""cultural support teams,"" have been used increasingly in recent years by the U.S. military. But the difference here is that these women are selected to team up with elite special forces. Afghans deeply resent special forces units' raids on their homes and villages when they are searching for high-value targets. The military women, it is hoped, will ease some of that resentment. Once a raid has secured an area, the women will move in and be the ones who search Afghan women, something male troops cannot do without causing great upset. The women also are living and working with special forces teams in small villages and towns, talking to women and helping with medical care and social needs. Maj. Patrick McCarthy evaluates candidates applying to join the program and decides who will be selected for the rigorous six-week training course at Fort Bragg. About half of those who apply don't get selected. McCarthy says he is looking for both brain and brawn. And he wants troops who can make quick decisions in the murky circumstances troops often find themselves in on the front lines of Afghanistan. ""These women are a cut above the rest of the Army,"" says McCarthy, pointing to a group in a morning training class. If this calls to mind the Demi Moore film ""GI Jane,"" it is a comparison that Capt. Annie Kleiman, a team member, rejects. ""We're not going to be shaving our heads anytime soon,"" she says. But she is firm on one point: ""We've got a bunch of strong, capable, awesome women who can take any challenge that's thrown at us."" The women know they still must prove themselves once they are in Afghanistan. ""This is the first time women have formally worked with special operations forces."" says Staff Sgt Danielle Bayer, also part of the training course. ""It's being acknowledged women can operate at this level."" It's a politically delicate issue. Women are not allowed to serve in front-line combat units. So these women -- heavily armed -- will only go into compounds after they are secured by assault teams. ""The women that are on raids, they're not deliberately part of the direct-action raid. They are there to help mitigate following the raid,"" says McCarthy. But in a war with no true front line, these women will face risks being so far from larger, more secure military bases. Just last month, 1st Lt. Ashley White, who was a team member, and two male soldiers were killed during what the Army described as ""combat operations"" in Afghanistan. The first death of a team member has made the program so sensitive that no senior Army special operations commander would talk to CNN on camera. But the women did. ""This is a program that is going to keep going on,"" said Sgt. Christine Baldwin, who is just back from Afghanistan. ""It's a need that needs to be met over there right now.""","Women are on the front line of dealing directly with Afghan women and children .

"(CNN) -- The dirty and tattered piece of paper, with remnants of thick black industrial-strength tape still stuck to its edges, would not necessarily seem to be a harbinger of summer. But those capitalized words running down the page ... CATCH. SAFARI. CAL GIRLS. BE TRUE. GET AROUND ... I pulled the piece of paper from the surface of the stage right after the show had ended. There was a copy of it next to the base of each microphone stand, so the musicians could look down to see what they were supposed to play and sing next. The capitalized words were shorthand for each song: . ""Catch a Wave."" ""Surfin' Safari."" ""California Girls."" ""Be True to Your School."" ""I Get Around."" Summer's coming, all right. I had caught up with the Beach Boys in Fort Myers, Florida, on a Friday night this spring. They were scheduled to play at the Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall. It will soon be half a century that they have been singing and touring. Fifty years since they really were little more than boys, writing and singing the songs of summer for the first time. Too much has happened to them since they first took to the stage wearing those identical striped shirts, nervous young men careful to bow to the audience after each song. Carl Wilson and Dennis Wilson are dead; the much-publicized acrimony in the band has meant that Brian Wilson, Mike Love and Al Jardine almost never share the same stage anymore. Not that anyone asked for my opinion, but here it is anyway: We all are given a finite number of heartbeats in this life. If I were those three guys, I'd find some way to put the old anger aside and play that wonderful music together again. Before it's too late. But this column isn't about the singers. It's about the songs they gave to the world. The songs have brought so much happiness to so many generations, for all these years. ""Little Deuce Coupe"" and ""Shut Down"" and ""Surfer Girl"" and ""Surfin' U.S.A."" -- they are America's enduring soundtrack of summer, they somehow never grow old, and there is a chance that, because of those songs, the Beach Boys may one day enter John Philip Sousa territory in the national memory, becoming a sustaining part of U.S. history. It's too soon for that, though; for now, there's a new summer of one-nighters stretching out ahead. Backstage in Fort Myers we ate a cafeteria-style dinner; I sat with Randell Kirsch, a Beach Boys guitarist with whom I spent 15 summers on the road while he and I were touring with Jan and Dean. He told me that at a television studio in California recently he had shared a similar commissary meal with astronaut Buzz Aldrin. ""We talked about the moon, spirituality and surf music,"" Randell said. That is one of the many unlikely places that singing the songs of summer can take a person: to the side of a man who walked upon the surface of the moon. John Stamos, the actor, has gone on the road to sing with the Beach Boys whenever he can for the last 25 years; he was in Fort Myers on this night, and as we talked, Mike Love, the band's lead singer, came over with his own plate of food. I asked him if he thought there might be a band called the Beach Boys on the road even after all the original Beach Boys are gone. ""I don't see why not,"" he said. ""The music's not going to die, is it?"" That's the secret. There is something about those songs that transcends nostalgia, that parts the clouds, that brings smiles of contentment year after year, town after town. No matter how cruddy the day may have been, no matter what worries may be gnawing at you. ... Well, as the song advises: ""Don't Worry, Baby."" Everything will turn out all right. The show started, the guitars sounded, the audience rose to cheer. The gloriously predictable set -- ""Wouldn't It Be Nice,"" ""Dance, Dance, Dance,"" ""Sloop John B,"" ""Good Vibrations"" -- unfurled. For 105 minutes, the world seemed peaceful. As ""Help Me, Rhonda"" was ending, Stamos looked to where I was standing in the wings and motioned with his head for me to join him. He handed me his candy-apple-red Gibson ES-335, and we shared a microphone on ""Barbara Ann,"" and I wish you who are reading these words could look out into a Beach Boys audience and see the upturned faces on the cusp of another summer, the people joyfully singing along with songs whose lyrics they know as well as they know the Pledge of Allegiance or the names of the presidents. Unhappiness, it seems, can against all odds be kept at bay. One-hundred-five minutes at a time. It was after the encore, after the audience had filed out, that I returned to the stage and tore that set list from the floor. I glanced at it: CATCH. SAFARI. CAL GIRLS. BE TRUE. GET AROUND. ... I stuck it into my pocket. A souvenir in advance of warm months that will soon be arriving. However many of those heartbeats we each are given, they seem to swell more gratefully when summer is on its way. Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world.","Bob Greene says it's been nearly 50 years since Beach Boys started singing and touring .

"(CNN) -- ""I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was fulfill my profession,"" Hillary Clinton famously snapped on the campaign trail two decades ago Friday. Mostly, we remember the comment as a moment in the perpetual mommy wars, but I tend to think about it as a moment in the history of chocolate chip cookies. Capitalizing on the political gaffe, Family Circle challenged Clinton to a bake-off, and she obliged, providing an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe that handily defeated Barbara Bush's variant. (You can still find it winning rave reviews online.) Home-baked cookies struck at the heart of what we thought mothering was all about. It's still true today, but we have given it new meaning. In 1992, Clinton's comment drew scorching responses from at-home mothers and cheers from fellow working moms. Such polarized reactions should be set in the context of Clinton's own life. Among the few women in her Yale Law School class, Clinton fought hard for professional success. Her remark was not merely a political misstep, but a generational declaration: a reflection of gut-level struggles women had made for workplace opportunity, even as mothers. Yet, the long reach of what was, after all, an offhand remark touches on something deeper than a mere episode in the nation's contrived reality show, ""Mom v. Mom."" Through the twists and turns of that cookie-baking scandal, we experienced the birthing pains of the working family. An idealized image of mothering stays powerfully with us: children arriving home from school, met at the door with warm chocolate chip cookies and a motherly embrace. That image evokes devotion, time and, most importantly, love. It is middle-class parenting unstressed by the demands of labor, whether paid or unpaid (the pans and trays awaiting washing are generally conveniently left out of the picture). What was true 20 years ago is still true today: Many of us struggle with profound ambivalence about the demands that mothers' paid labor make on that idealized possibility. We long to care without pressure. The still distinct memory of Clinton's unsavvy comment speaks to a deep-seated cultural experience of loss. With more than two-thirds of mothers in the labor force today, few families are immune to negotiating child care and paid work. The plate of chocolate chip cookies embodies our desire for parenting and family space free of the demands of our paid jobs. Still, there are signs of change. ""Working family"" was a term newly in use when Clinton made her famous comment, but working mothers have been, however messily and tentatively, forging a new model of parenting and laboring since that time. Parents' priorities have changed, but not at the expense of their kids. Recent studies of time use by sociologists at the University of Maryland show employed mothers spending as much time in primary child care as nonemployed mothers in 1975. Working-family mothers live with messier houses but report higher levels of enjoyment in their children's company than three decades ago. Today's working mother may be mixing up fewer batches of cookies, but when she does, she's often baking with the kids -- the activity not so much abandoned, as reserved for moments that matter to parent and child. This new pragmatism doesn't mean there's no lingering guilt. The middle-class parents who still suffer most, I suspect, from cookie angst could learn from working-class women who have long seen good parenting in providing. Devotion to children can come in the form of earning what it takes to put treats on the table. And they would do well to listen to another first lady, Michelle Obama, who as a black woman is well schooled in the multiple roles that black women, whether middle class or poor, have long fulfilled. Black mothers historically have believed they are dedicated mothers, even while earning money for their families. No one assumed that Obama, in her lawyer days before the White House, devoted herself to cookie making, but we knew she was a good mother. Although it has not been as widely reported about as her gardens, Obama has been a voice for working families in the White House, speaking regularly on behalf of work-life initiatives. True, her shortbread cookies lost to Cindy McCain's oatmeal-butterscotch in Family Circle's 2008 bake-off. But more telling was that Working Mother magazine named her one of the country's most powerful working moms in 2011. I have always been embarrassed by Clinton's cookies. They seemed like a capitulation to politics seeking to turn back the clock on women's roles. But I have begun to think that I shouldn't be. Twenty years ago Friday, that first lady campaigner made a divisive declaration on working motherhood. Perhaps we should see Clinton's successful decades in the public limelight since as a lesson in the new pragmatism. Like Clinton, we can have our cookies, and careers, too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kirsten Swinth.","Kirsten Swinth: Hillary Clinton's ""cookie-baking"" remark stung women 20 years ago .

"(CNN) -- Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt, died from drinking a mixture of poisons and not from a snake bite, a German historian said Wednesday. The theory by Christoph Schaefer, a professor of ancient history at Trier University, challenges the common, centuries-old belief that Cleopatra committed suicide with the bite of an asp. ""It is certain that there was no cobra,"" Schaefer told CNN by phone Wednesday. An asp is a small venomous snake also called the Egyptian cobra. Schaefer said he studied historic writings and consulted a toxicologist to develop the theory, which is due to be featured Wednesday on the German channel ZDF as part of a program on the Egyptian queen. He also deduced that Cleopatra wouldn't have chosen to die by a snake bite because she was intent on suicide -- and a cobra, he said, is not always fatal. When a person does die from a cobra bite, he said, ""it doesn't go quickly -- it is a horrible death,"" in which it takes hours to die and the victim suffers paralysis to parts of their body, including the eyes. Cleopatra died a ""quiet and pain-free death,"" according to the Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing about 200 years after she died, Schaefer said. Ancient texts also say Cleopatra's two assistants died with her, but that would be unlikely if she had died of a snake bite, the historian said. Also, temperatures in August -- when Cleopatra committed suicide in 30 B.C. -- would have been so high that a snake probably wouldn't have stayed still enough to bite, he said. Ancient papyri show that Cleopatra knew about poisons, and one papyrus says she actually tested them, Schaefer said. Death by poison would make sense given the way in which Cleopatra wanted to die, and the fact that she died at the same time as her two handmaidens, he said. Schaefer said he worked with German toxicologist Dietrich Mebs to determine which poisons Cleopatra might have used. They decided it was hemlock, mixed with wolfsbane and opium. ""Opium is quiet and with it, one can really fall into a deadly sleep,"" Schaefer said. Asked why the tale of the asp has lingered for more than 2,000 years, he said most people simply believed the common story. A cobra can be fatal, and Cleopatra has historically been pictured with one, ""so it makes sense"" for people to believe that version, he said. Many of the ancient depictions of Cleopatra with a cobra, however, were simply showing her reception in the afterlife, he said. It was only in the 15th century that painters first started showing Cleopatra with an asp on her arm, and later, they painted the snake on her breast. In Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, she dies in the final scene from the bite of two asps -- one to her breast and one to her arm. Cleopatra ruled Egypt from 51 to 30 B.C. and was the last pharaoh before Egypt became a Roman province. She was Julius Caesar's mistress in Rome and, after he was assassinated, she returned to Egypt and began a relationship with Mark Antony, one of the three leaders of Rome after Caesar's death. Cleopatra joined Antony at the Battle of Actium in Greece. He committed suicide when his forces were defeated, and Cleopatra then returned to Egypt to do the same.","Cleopatra died after drinking poisons and not snake bite, German scholar says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Elvira Sosa left Mexico for the United States more than 30 years ago, but last year was the first time she'd been counted as part of the U.S. Census. Sosa was among thousands of illegal immigrants in Los Angeles who filled out a census form last year, and city officials said the response, especially among Latinos, might have saved the area money and congressional representation. The increased count was purposeful: A Census Bureau outreach program urged undocumented workers to fill out the census and assured them that nothing on the form could be used against them. The program included Spanish call centers that would field questions about the census, plus billboards, bus advertisements and fliers with information. Celebrities publicized the census, too. The response: The 2010 census showed that the numbers of Latinos living in this country increased by 43%, from 35 million to more than 50 million, during the past 10 years. Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, testified before a Senate subcommittee this month that Latino participation in the census was ""unprecedented."" But in some areas, poor communication, hostility toward Latinos and immigrants and a cultural fear of the government prevented a complete count, he said. In Sosa's case, her daughter encouraged her to fill out the form. ""It's important to count me,"" Sosa said in broken English, ""because I'm important. I live in this country."" Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was thrilled by Los Angeles' mail participation rate. At more than 70%, he said, it was among the highest for large cities and close to the national mail participation rate of 74%. More important, it might have secured money and political clout for the area. The Census Bureau uses population counts to apportion seats in the House of Representatives, and the federal government uses decennial census data to distribute more than $400 billion a year. ""The last time around, 10 years ago, we were the second-worst among big cities in the country in terms of the undercount,"" Villaraigosa said. The 2000 undercount cost Los Angeles more than $200 million in federal funds. Villaraigosa believes the outreach to the Latino and immigrant communities and the homeless population account for Los Angeles' 2010 response success. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials said each person in the United States, legal or not, is worth about $1,400 in federal funds to a community per year. Cities use these federal dollars to help pay for police and fire protection, along with vital infrastructure and other services. It is illegal, however, to use federal dollars to aid illegal immigrants directly, and they cannot receive government assistance. Instead, religious and other organizations fill the void. At the Margaret Aylward Center for the Poor in the Hispanic-heavy L.A. suburb of Pico Rivera, the size of the Latino population was clear well before it was counted by the census. Sister Vickey Haran said the center relies solely on donations; if she accepted government funding, she'd be required to ask those seeking help from the center to prove their residency status. ""It's a ministry to the poor,"" said Haran, who runs the center along with the Holy Faith Sisters. ""We serve anyone who comes and asks for food. We do not ask for papers. We do not ask any proof."" Share your story through iReport's Cultural Census . The count is about more than money and resources, though. Villaraigosa said California would have lost a congressional seat if this census count remained at or near the same as in 2000. That seat was saved, he said, because more people were counted. ""What this does is, at a minimum, it allows California and other states with large immigrant populations to get the representation they deserve,"" Villaraigosa said. But knowing that illegal immigrants might help to maintain the political power for a city or district raises the ire of some anti-immigration groups. ""You have an imbalance,"" said Glenn Spencer, founder of American Patrol. ""You might have a congressional district in Los Angeles of 600,000 people but only 100,000 citizens. So those citizens have five times the voting power of someone in Iowa. You'll have politicians who say 'I want these people counted. I get more power, but I can manipulate the situation because they can't vote.' ""","Census: Latinos living in U.S. increased by 43 percent, from 35 million to 50 million .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The United States ""has no reason to doubt"" the authenticity of a video that purports to show ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi delivering a sermon at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul, two U.S. officials said. While the United States cannot absolutely guarantee it is the notoriously elusive leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the working assumption by the government is that it is him, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. If it is al-Baghdadi, it may just reveal how comfortable the ISIS leader is after his fighters took control of Iraq's second-largest city. ""Iraqi agencies are still investigating the video and comparing it with its intelligence,"" Iraq's military spokesman, Lt. Gen. Qassim Atta, said on Monday. ISIS, an al Qaeda splinter group, has seized large areas of northern and western Iraq in an offensive that began last month. Al-Baghdadi is known to the United States as Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badry. He was taken into custody in Fallujah in the Anbar province on February 4, 2004, according to a Pentagon statement. There have been mixed reports about when and why he was detained. He was held until the following December at a a prison at Camp Bucca, according to the Pentagon. A review board recommended his ""unconditional release,"" the statement said. While the Pentagon said al-Baghdadi was from Fallujah, other reports have said he is from Samarra, north of Baghdad. Taking aim at ISIS: Women train with AK-47s . Parliament postponed . State-run Iraqiya TV said Monday that Parliament has been postponed for at least a month, a day before lawmakers were scheduled to return to form a new government and begin the process of selecting a prime minister. Citing sources in Parliament, Iraqiya reported that the session was postponed until August 12 because the political parties have been unable to reach a consensus on who to name to country's top leadership posts. Those include the speaker, the president and the prime minister. A week ago, Iraq's Parliament postponed its first session, citing a lack of a quorum after 90 lawmakers walked out. Suicide car bomb in Baghdad . A suicide car bomb exploded in heavy traffic at a security checkpoint in Baghdad's Kadhimiya neighborhood on Monday, killing at least seven people and wounding 14, security officials told CNN. The death toll is expected to rise, they said. The bomb exploded at about 1 p.m. near the checkpoint, which created a sort of bottleneck of traffic. The explosion occurred less than mile (1 kilometer) from the Kadhimiya shrine, which is revered by Shiites. The bombing follows a double bombing last week in the same area that killed at least 25 people and wounded 32. Iraqi security forces commander killed . A Twitter account widely believed to be linked to the ISIS in Salaheddin province claimed in a post that its fighters killed an Iraqi military commander. According to the post, Iraqi Army Col. Ibrahim Abdullah Hussein was killed. It posted what it claimed was a picture of Hussein's corpse as well as a photograph of his ID card. CNN cannot independently confirm the claim. Some militant groups are known to release pictures of ID cards as evidence of deaths. British ambassador: Baghdad warned repeatedly . Britain's ambassador to Iraq says Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government was warned repeatedly over the past several months about the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. ""The fact that Mosul was vulnerable was known,"" Ambassador Simon Collis said on CNN's Amanpour show. ""The fact that ISIL were already holding territory from last year in parts of western Iraq, in Anbar, and elsewhere was well known."" Collis said Britain's message to al-Maliki's government was always the same: ""Any comprehensive counterterrorism strategy would need a political line of operation, an economic and development line of operation, as well as of course security operations."" He continued, ""And without that kind of comprehensive approach, it will be impossible to defeat an organization like ISIL."" ISIS is also referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Iraq's orphans ask 'why do these people kill other people?' Iraqi general killed . The commander of the Iraqi Army's 6th Division was killed in a battle on Monday, according to a statement released by the Prime Minister's office. He was identified as Gen. Nagm Abdullah Ali. The statement did not detail how he died. But Atta is quoted by Iraqi news organizations as saying he was killed in shelling in Ibrahim Bin Ali, a Sunni-dominated village about 16 miles north of Baghdad. CNN could not independently confirm the claim. Digging in around Baghdad . A commercial airliner roars overhead as one of the thousands of fighters who have taken up arms to protect the Iraqi capital digs into a position a few miles from Baghdad International Airport. Every 500 feet (150 meters), another fighter armed with an AK-47 assault rifle takes up another position about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the airport perimeter. This is the first line of seven similar concentric lines of defense between the outskirts of the capital and the airport, widely believed by Iraqi and U.S. officials to be a top target of ISIS. The fighters are members of the Badr Brigade, the Iranian-trained militia of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a powerful Shiite political party in Iraq. And they are officially taking up arms for the first time in more than a decade, reinforcing Iraq's military. It was just one of the signs Monday of stepped-up security in and around Baghdad amid fears that ISIS fighters and allied Sunni insurgents already inside the city will launch attacks, such as a bombing campaign.

"Siem Reap, Cambodia (CNN) -- Maneuvering slowly through grassy Cambodian terrain, a caravan of 20 men and women is on a search-and-rescue mission. Dressed in military fatigues, they are guided by a fearless leader who calculates every step and ensures the safest path for his comrades. It takes just minutes for the unit to confront the first of many hidden targets: a muddied 20-year-old land mine buried a few inches beneath the ground. ""This is an active land mine made from Russia. [If] we step on [it] ... it explodes and cuts the leg off,"" says Aki Ra, leader of the Cambodian Self Help Demining team. He and his group are working to make their country safer by clearing land mines -- many of which Aki Ra planted himself years ago. Aki Ra, a Cambodian native who does not recall his birth year, was a child soldier during the communist Khmer Rouge regime, a genocidal crusade responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Cambodians during the 1970s. He was raised by the army after being separated from his family during the internal conflict. Around age 10, Aki Ra estimates, he was given a rifle that measured his own height. Soon after, he was taught to lay land mines. For three years, Aki Ra worked as a mine layer for the Khmer Rouge. He then did the same job for the Vietnamese army that overthrew his village. ""I maybe planted 4,000 to 5,000 land mines in a [single] month,"" said Aki Ra, who says he's about 40 years old now. ""We planted them all over the place."" Watch a slideshow of some young land-mine victims Aki Ra has helped . According to the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority, an estimated 4 million to 6 million land mines were laid in Cambodia during three decades of conflict. The mines were planted to defend strategic military locations, target warring opponents and deny the use of roads. ""I had [bad] feelings, because sometimes we were fighting against our friends and relatives,"" Aki Ra said. ""I felt sad when I saw a lot of people were killed. A lot of people were suffering from land mines. [But] I did not know what to do, [because] we were under orders."" Approximately 63,000 civilians and soldiers have been in accidents involving land mines and other explosive weapons, according to the Cambodian Mine Victim Information System. Nearly 19,000 of them were killed. Today, Cambodia reportedly has one amputee for every 290 people, one of the highest ratios in the world. When the United Nations came in the early 1990s to help restore peace to Cambodia, Aki Ra saw an opportunity to begin undoing the damage he and others had done. He started training with the U.N. and helping them clear mines. It was around this time he got the name he goes by today. He was born Eoun Yeak, but he was so skilled at clearing mines that his supervisors began comparing him to AKIRA, a heavy-duty appliance company in Japan. One reportedly commented, ""He works just like an AKIRA."" The name stuck. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . In 1993, one year after working with the U.N., Aki Ra decided to begin clearing mines alone. ""Some of the areas I was clearing were places where I used to plant mines before,"" he said. ""I didn't have any equipment. ... I clear by knife, by stick."" For Aki Ra, this bare-hands technique ""wasn't dangerous. It was easy."" But easy didn't mean legal. The method was not in accordance with international standards, which requires protective gear and other professional equipment. So in 2005, he went to the United Kingdom to receive formal training and accreditation. In 2008, Aki Ra formed his nonprofit demining organization. Comprised of native Cambodians, it includes former soldiers and war crime victims. One of the workers is an amputee who lost a leg to a land mine. ""[Our] goal is to clear land mines in rural villages for the people who need the land for building houses or farming or building schools,"" Aki Ra said. Aki Ra and his organization devote all of their donated funds to clearing Cambodia's rural ""low-priority"" villages. These villages, populated primarily by poor farmers, do not always receive first dibs for minefield clearance projects because of their remoteness and limited traffic. At times, they're completely overlooked. ""Villagers report land mines every day, and they ask us to destroy [them],"" Aki Ra said. ""The people are afraid of mines. Whether there are a lot of land mines or only a few, [we] still have to clear the area so that the people in the village can be safe."" Kuot Visoth, chief of Prey Thom village, was relieved when the team arrived in early July to clear his village. ""I know the area around the school has a lot of land mines, and I am afraid that when the children come to school and play, they will step on them, or the villagers' buffaloes grazing in the area would be killed,"" Visoth said. Aki Ra estimates that he and his group have cleared more than 50,000 land mines and unexploded war weapons such as bombs and grenades. The Cambodian government says there are 3 million to 5 million mines still undiscovered. Many of Aki Ra's recovered land mines and unexploded weapons are on display at a museum in Siem Reap. For $2, visitors can touch defused mines and bombs as well as AK-47 rifles and war uniforms. ""I had an idea to open a land mine museum to teach people to understand about war, land mines,"" he said. ""Even though the war [is] finished, [these explosives] still kill people, and the land cannot be used."" Also at the museum is an orphanage that Aki Ra and his wife, Hourt, opened about a decade ago. Roughly 100 children, some injured by land mines, have been cared for over the years. The orphanage provides food and shelter for the children and sends them to public school. ""I brought them to the museum because I could provide them with [a] better situation,"" Aki Ra said. ""If I didn't help them, they would have a very difficult life."" The orphanage's first resident, Sot ""Tol"" Visay, lost a leg to a mine. He was living on the street when Aki Ra was demining in his province. Aki Ra offered Visay a home, and Visay has spent the past seven years living there. ""This place has been very good to me,"" said Visay, now 21. ""Mr. Aki Ra does not want anything from me. Instead, he encourages all people here to study, to gain knowledge."" Hourt died last year from a stroke, leaving Aki Ra to care for his three biological children and 27 orphans ages 10 to 20. Aki Ra is thankful to have caretakers, teachers, a chef and a driver who help look after the children during his demining missions, which can last up to 25 consecutive days every month. ""All the children living in my center I consider as my own children. They call me father,"" said Aki Ra, whose efforts in Cambodia will be highlighted in an upcoming documentary, ""A Perfect Soldier."" ""I have told them about my personal life. They understand all about my history. I tell the children that they should study hard, do good acts and love each other."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- The Humane Society has accused a federally funded primate center of mistreating chimpanzees and other primates, saying that some animals showed signs of psychosis and self-mutilation. New Iberia Research Center cages about 325 chimps on its 100 acres. It also has about 6,000 monkeys. The allegations against the New Iberia Research Center in Louisiana, which houses more than 6,500 primates, came after a nine-month undercover investigation. The center denies the allegations. ""We found animals living in isolation, exhibiting self-mutilating behavior, psychosis, all sorts of emotional and physical problems at this laboratory,"" Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle told CNN on Wednesday. The Humane Society's undercover investigator, who worked as a laboratory technician with a hidden camera, revealed 338 violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act, which sets standards for the treatment of animals in labs, Pacelle said. The Humane Society posted some of its secret footage on its Web site. The footage includes an animal with what the group said was a self-inflicted wound, another animal jumping in circles in its cage, and chimpanzees screaming as lab technicians approached with a dart gun. The violations were filed in a 108-page complaint to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which is required by law to enforce the Animal Welfare Act, the organization said. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said he will order a thorough investigation of animal welfare practices at the facility. ""If the allegations prove to be true, the American public can expect the perpetrators to be held fully accountable. I take the protection of animals very seriously, and will do my utmost to fully enforce the Animal Welfare Act,"" he said in a written statement. The New Iberia Research Center, part of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, issued a statement saying that the videos ""distort acceptable standard procedures and incorrectly imply mistreatment of nonhuman primates at the New Iberia Research Center."" It added: ""We take very seriously our responsibility to care for the animals housed at the center and to carry out biomedical research according to federal rules and regulations."" The center further said it properly housed and cared for the animals. It also said it complies with regulations of the USDA, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Humane Society accused workers at New Iberia of hitting primates on the mouth, using ""painful"" dart guns and removing infant monkeys from their mothers. The Humane Society also said it had documented evidence of ""rampant"" breeding of government-owned chimpanzees. In 2007, the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Research Resources, following a 12-year moratorium, said it would no longer breed chimpanzees for research, citing financial reasons. The New Iberia Research Center has received more than $37 million in grants from the NIH, according to the center's Web site. The NIH said it has opened an investigation regarding the allegations and said it is working closely with the USDA. However, it said it could not comment on the allegations while its investigation is under way. ""The results will be available when the investigation is complete,"" the NIH said in a written statement. ""We are committed to the safety and welfare of all animals in research. All animals used in federally funded research are protected by laws, regulations, and policies to ensure they are used in the smallest numbers possible and with the greatest commitment to their comfort."" Pacelle said the most serious issue was the self-mutilation and ""nonstop pacing and circling, psychosis and other abnormal behaviors."" ""These are highly intelligent animals. They have a sense of self, they have a sense of past and future, they have the wide range of emotions that we have,"" he said. ""They should not be subjected to this long-term, decade-long isolation, and all these painful and physical procedures and the psychological torment in these laboratories."" The New Iberia Research Center says it offers a ""broad range of diagnostic, laboratory, and human resources for the development and characterization of nonhuman primate models for applied and basic research aimed at promoting human quality of life.""

"(CNN) -- A new invasion of pyrotechnics and full-body costumes will assault London this weekend, as the 2014 NFL International Series signs off with a third sell-out date at Wembley Stadium. More than any previous tour, this series has delivered on the league's grand ambition to embed itself in the public imagination overseas. Backed by feverish hype and a willing host government, NFL chiefs are confidently predicting a permanent franchise in London within a few years. As the party gets started ahead of Dallas Cowboys vs. Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, events will be closely followed by Richard Scudamore, the all-powerful Chief Executive of England's Premier League (EPL), who would dearly love to take the 'other' football on tour, sending Manchester United and Chelsea over to entertain the locals in New York or Shanghai. Scudamore, credited with much of the league's vast commercial success since his appointment in 1999, first raised the idea of adding an extra, overseas fixture -- the ""39th game"" - to the calendar in 2008. That proposal was swiftly shot down but, in August, Scudamore maintained: ""It will happen at some point."" At an informal meeting in October, Premier League officials discussed the possibility of a single round of fixtures from the existing schedule being taken abroad as early as the 2016-17 season. It is easy to see the appeal. The league is the most popular domestic sporting product in the world, with a vast global audience worth over £650 million ($1.04 billion) each year in international TV rights. Overseas friendlies have also been richly rewarded, with Manchester United earning £8 million ($12.8 million) over three matches in the U.S. last summer. One of these, a 3-1 win over Real Madrid in Michigan, broke the American attendance record for the sport with a crowd of 109, 318 at the ""Big House."" The Premier League's competitors are looking abroad to find ways of closing the gap. Italy's Serie A has international TV rights worth just £146 ($234 million) million each year, but already plays its Super Cup match abroad. Past locations include China and the U.S., with the next edition set to be held in Qatar. Roma President James Palotta is keen for league fixtures to follow. Such expansion is a strategic goal for owners of English team, says Alex Fynn, a football consultant who advised the country's Football Association on the creation of the Premier League. ""The majority of clubs are foreign owned, and it's a natural step for them,"" says Fynn . ""The Premier League is no longer an English league, it's an international league that happens to played in England. If that's the case why not play it abroad? That's the owners' thinking."" If clubs are the driving force for the proposed changes, they have been reluctant to say so. West Ham United vice-chairman Karen Brady has said she ""likes the idea,"" and Swansea City Chairman Huw Jenkins has said matches abroad are ""inevitable"". But a spokesman for the Welsh club later claimed that Jenkins had been misquoted, while West Ham, along with most clubs, will not discuss the matter until they see a formal proposal. The caution has been conditioned by fierce and unanimous hostility from supporters. The 2008 proposal was killed off in little over a week by sustained campaigning from fan groups, including lobbying international authorities and nationwide protests. The response this time has been just as emphatic, with every supporter trust rapidly issuing a condemnation of the plans. ""The first issue is competitive integrity,"" says Tim Rolls of the Chelsea Supporter's Trust. ""Half the teams would lose a home game and the normal advantage of that."" Rolls lists concerns over when the games abroad would be played -- potentially at a crucial stage of the season -- as well as the dramatically different conditions they could be played under, and which games were chosen. ""Not all games are going to be attractive to foreign audiences so would they engineer the draw, or make it purely at random? Say you play Burnley's home match with Manchester United in Kuala Lumpur -- their home fans are losing the most attractive game of the season."" Research from supporter trusts with their overseas branches in Asia revealed that few were keen on league games in their countries, with a popular response being that the setting of famous stadiums like Old Trafford or Anfield is an integral part of the appeal. Activists believe this supports a business argument for keeping clubs in England. ""Our argument is that what makes the premier league so effective at generating sales overseas is not just what's on the pitch -- Spain and Germany have been more successful lately,"" says Kevin Miles, chief executive of the Football Supporter Federation, which represents fans across the country. ""Scudamore and the league are very aware that when it comes to overseas sales, atmosphere and tradition are crucial to what they were selling, and give them the edge. I think they jeopardize that at their peril."" Despite recent progress, the NFL still highlights the challenge of exporting passion for teams outside the U.S., believes Michael Oriard, former lineman for the Kansas City Chiefs, academic and author of several books on the business of the sport. ""I've long believed that marketing the NFL overseas would struggle, because my sense of team sports is that they are locally rooted,"" says Oriard. ""Europe has its football, ours is alien there so it's harder for people to attach themselves. The London games have done well but they are largely curiosities."" However, Oriard believes that NFL fans are more tolerant of international games that their English counterparts as Americans ""are often more attached to the league than a team."" The NFL also has the advantage of avoiding barriers from international bodies that the Premier League now faces. FIFA -- football's global governing body -- rules dictate that games abroad would need to be approved by all relevant member associations and confederations, with the global authority retaining a veto in any case. UEFA, which runs European football, is emphasizing the obstacles, while the Asian confederation previously rejected the ""39th game."" The timing is problematic, against the backdrop of mounting criticism and supporter disillusionment with governance in the English game. A leading concern is ticket prices that have risen over 1000% in many cases since the Premier League was introduced in 1992, pricing out younger and lower-earning fans, an issue which has led to fan activists targeting sponsors. Fans also argue that prohibitive pricing has damaged the matchday atmosphere, and there is increasing acknowledgment that this is under threat. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho recently criticized the club's home support, saying it felt like his team was ""playing in an empty stadium,"" while various clubs are promoting initiatives such as dedicated singing sections. Anger directed at club owners is growing, fueled by disastrous cases of mismanagement at teams such as Leeds and Portsmouth, both of which have entered administration and tumbled out of England's elite division. Thirty-six league clubs have gone into administration in the Premier League era. Supporters are demanding a greater role in clubs' decisions, often inspired by Germany's 50+1 rule that guarantees majority fan ownership. English clubs like Wimbledon and Portsmouth have been saved from extinction by fans who now run them successfully. That model could become commonplace. The Labour party has committed to historic legislation should it win next year's election, that would see supporter representatives on the boards of every club in England. The government has responded with a working group aiming to facilitate supporter ownership. Despite their many grievances, the loyalty of local fan bases was shown by attendances of 96% capacity at Premier League games in 2012/13. But playing league games abroad would represent an unprecedented test of that loyalty, at a time of growing tension. It would motivate and mobilize vast numbers of local supporters in opposition, to prove they cannot be taken for granted . The issue marks a crossroads for major English clubs on the journey from community institutions to global brands. Should the campaign against matches abroad succeed, it could mark a new era of supporter involvement and democratic ownership. If the League gets its wish for foreign fixtures, it could pave the way for even more radical transformations such as cross-border leagues and the slashing of the domestic calendar. At a time of great uncertainty, only change is guaranteed.","The NFL returns to London Sunday, as Dallas Cowboys take on Jacksonville Jaguars .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell was named special envoy for the Middle East during an event at the State Department on Thursday afternoon. President Obama, left, with George Mitchell, right, who was named special Middle East envoy Thursday. The move could signal that Obama plans to get involved in the Mideast peace process early in his term. It was announced just before 3 p.m. at an event with President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Also Thursday, former U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke was named special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced. Holbrooke, who worked as a diplomat, journalist and investment banker, became one of the most influential diplomats in U.S. history when he worked in the mid-90s to end the brutal fighting in the Balkans. He was the main architect of the Dayton Accords that ended the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After he was officially named Obama's envoy, Mitchell said, ""I don't underestimate the difficulty of this assignment."" ""The situation in the Middle East is volatile, complex and dangerous. But the president and the secretary of state have made it clear that danger and difficulty cannot cause the United States to turn away,"" he said.  Watch Mitchell accept his appointment » . Mitchell said that along with Obama and Clinton, he believed a goal of a Jewish state and a Palestinian state living side by side was possible and the conflict, even if centuries old, could end -- a lesson, he said, he learned during his negotiations in Northern Ireland. ""From my experience there, I formed the conviction that there is no such thing as a conflict that can't be ended,"" Mitchell said. ""Conflicts are created, conducted and sustained by human beings. They can be ended by human beings."" In recent days, Obama officials talked to Israeli, Palestinian and Arab diplomats about the choice, sources close to the administration and diplomats told CNN. After Mitchell was introduced Thursday, Obama said, ""Time and again, in public service and private life, he has acted with skill and acted with integrity. He will be fully empowered at the negotiating table, and he will sustain our focus on the goal of peace. "" Mitchell served as a Mideast envoy for the Bush administration, writing a 2001 report that called for a halt to Israeli settlements and greater Palestinian efforts to crack down on terror. He also was a peace broker on Northern Ireland for President Clinton. Sallai Meridor, Israel's ambassador to the United States, released a statement Thursday saying, ""Israel holds Sen. Mitchell in high regard and looks forward to working with him on taking the next steps towards realizing a future of peace and security for Israel and her neighbors."" Meridor also said Holbrooke was a ""longstanding friend of Israel and we wish him every success."" Holbrooke called his mission ""a very difficult assignment."" ""Nobody can say the war in Afghanistan has gone well, and yet, as we speak here today, American men and women and their coalition partners are fighting a very difficult struggle against a ruthless and determined enemy without any scruples at all,"" he said after his appointment was announced. But Holbrooke said, ""If our resources are mobilized and coordinated and pulled together, we can quadruple, quintuple, multiply by tenfold the effectiveness of our efforts there."" Mitchell and Holbrooke are two of several envoys who will work in the new administration. Sources say Dennis Ross, a former Mideast peace envoy for several previous administrations, will be an envoy in charge of engaging Iran, but it's unclear what role he'll play in light of Mitchell's appointment. CNN's Ed Henry and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: Mitchell says a Jewish state and a Palestinian state living in peace is possible .

"(CNN) -- He was just 4 years old when his treatment sparked international outrage. About a year later, he won an award for the world's youngest sailor. And he piloted a plane before he turned 6. Up next? Crossing the Tibetan Plateau by unicycle. Welcome to the unorthodox and controversial world of Duoduo and his ""Eagle Dad."" The world first met little Duoduo, as he's nicknamed, in 2012. A video surfaced of his small 4-year-old frame shivering in subfreezing temperatures. ""Daddy, Daddy please hold me!"" Duo cried into the camera. His tiny body was shielded from the cold and snowy New York winter only by bright yellow underwear and a pair of white sneakers. His family was in New York on vacation, but there's no time off from training when you're the son of He Liesheng. That video drew criticism and some praise from around the world. But He didn't mind. He says he knew what he was doing. ""I've always felt Chinese parents spoil their only child too much,"" he told CNN at the time. ""We don't expose them to nature enough, and they get weaker and less competitive compared to foreign children."" He, who dubbed himself Eagle Dad, didn't just want his son to succeed, he wanted him to soar. ""Like an eagle, I push my child to the limit so he can learn how to fly."" Two years later, the duo have made good on that pledge. At their high-end apartment in Nanjing, certificates from Chinese authorities line the walls, and there are world records: There's one for the youngest person to start an investment company and one for the youngest pilot. The latter acknowledges Duoduo's 30-minute flight near Beijing at an altitude of 1,000 feet. Also posted on the wall: spreadsheets and documents that detail Duoduo's daily schedule. The precocious 6-year-old rises at 7 a.m., but only on his holiday. Normally, he wakes up at 6:30. But even the world's youngest pilot gets a day to rest. ""On Sunday, I can even watch movies."" Duoduo says. The energetic child, who happily speaks his mind and tears around the apartment, stands in sharp contrast to the child the world first saw crying and upset in the snow. Looking back on that day in New York, Duoduo remembers the cold, but he also remembers what came next. ""When I was running nearly naked, I kept crying. And then dad gave me a hot bath."" For his part, He says there's more to their story than the extreme images. Yes, he made his son run in the snow, and he also took him skiing and made him take cold baths. But there were less dramatic scenes, too. The family focuses on education, He insists, and the tough stuff has a purpose. ""If a child does not go through hardship, then he cannot become strong,"" he explains. ""That means when they are small, you should let your child struggle more, allow them to experience more, and it is good for their development."" Their life isn't all struggle, though. Duoduo lives comfortably and hopes to grow up to become an entrepreneur like Bill Gates ""because you can help other people and you can buy a lot of things."" And what does the boy himself think of his Eagle Dad's methods? ""The good side is that I can learn a lot. The bad side is that he's just too strict!""","Duoduo piloted a plane and started an investment company by age 6 .

"(CNN) -- As the source of the Ganges River, the site of Hinduism's famous Char Dham pilgrimage and home to Rishikesh, the meditation retreat made famous by The Beatles, the India's northern Uttarakhand state justifies its title of ""Land of the Gods."" But environmentalists are warning that rampant development in the Himalayan state is tempting fate. With roads built on an ad hoc basis, new hotel developments built on river banks and hydro dams proposed in the region's steep valleys, environmentalists say the floods and mudslides that have claimed more than 1,000 lives in the past week were an ecological catastrophe waiting to happen. ""You've heard of homicide, well this is ecocide,"" Devinder Sharma of the Forum for Biotechnology and Food Security told CNN. ""The hills have been shorn of the forest cover, there's extensive mining taking place in this region and on top of that the roads that are being constructed are haphazard. ""And the hydro projects coming are phenomenal -- 70 hydro projects back to back. Obviously there are tunnels being built, hills being blasted and everything goes topsy-turvy. ""We are playing with nature but at the same time blaming nature."" He said while a massive national road-building program had been well received by India's state governments, routes had been planned through increasingly remote areas without adequate drainage, exacerbating the problems of coping with massive run-off from the region's monsoon rains. A real estate boom in the region has also resulted in new developments going ahead without adequate planning permission. ""It's a classical model of disaster,"" he said. ""If you want to see globally what can happen in regions like the Alps or the Rocky Mountains or elsewhere you only have to take a look at Uttarakhand."" Souparno Banerjee of the Indian advocacy group the Center for Science and Environment said that despite state government denials, most experts were of the view that unregulated development and unregulated tourism is responsible for the scale of the disaster. ""Development is important but we need to keep in mind the very delicate eco-system that you're working within,"" he said. ""The Himalayas are the biggest mountain range in the world but they are also extremely fragile. ""You need to keep that in mind when putting disaster management plans in place."" He said his organization recommended a certain amount of flow necessary to keep rivers in the region at a safe level, but that dam projects and river diversions for roads had backed up with flood waters from torrential rains. ""The drainage in many areas is half-baked,"" he told CNN. Uttarakhand's chief minister Vijay Bahuguna told the Times of India newspaper that the floods had set back the state by at least three years in terms of development. ""My people are going to suffer because tourism is going to be affected. We have to put the infrastructure back on the rails. I have written to the prime minister that preliminary reports suggest there is loss of Rs 3,000 crore (US$500 million). This tragedy has broken our economy,"" he said. He said that a balance needed to be struck between the environment and development, adding that he did not want migration away from Uttarakhand. ""Seventy percent of my state is forest cover. (If) I am preserving my forests for the nation then why don't you give me compensation? Let the country compensate us."" He denied that the disaster was man-made and a result of the indiscriminate construction of hotels and houses. ""This is a very childish argument -- that cloudbursts, earthquakes and tsunamis are caused by human factors. In the history of hundreds of years of Kedarnath (a region of the state), no such incident has taken place. In a Himalayan state, this catastrophe has come about in 37,000 square miles of area. This cloudburst, 330 millimetres of rain, cannot be anticipated.""","Environmentalists blame rampant development for high death toll in Uttarakhand .

"(CNN) -- Independence Day is a celebration not just of America's independence, but also of the values that are important to our nation, like liberty, democracy and human rights. Recently, former President Jimmy Carter suggested that America should be a little less self-congratulatory and a little more self-critical. He was concerned that America is abandoning its role as a leading advocate for human rights. It is hard to disagree with some of his observations. But, America has not fallen behind in providing moral leadership in the world. The current period is no different from earlier decades. It is not, as Carter said, either ""cruel"" or ""unusual."" There is no doubt that both the Bush and Obama administrations have trampled on fundamental human rights norms on the grounds that certain sacrifices must be made in order to protect American national interests. The question naturally arises: Couldn't the United States have found ways to fight terrorism without turning human rights into collateral damage? There is evidence that sacrificing human rights has not made America any safer. For instance, the increased use of drone attacks might or might not have disrupted terror networks in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but we do know that they have killed and injured countless civilians and inflamed anti-American rhetoric. The issue isn't whether the United States will be able to win a popularity contest in the region (this is doubtful even in the best of times), but rather, that alienating large swaths of the local population makes it much more difficult to defeat terrorism. Where to find exceptional America . Similarly, in the name of counterterrorism, the United States has pursued worrisome policies, including targeted assassinations overseas and intrusions on civil liberties. While our country's counterterrorism policies have compromised its respect for human rights norms, a little perspective is needed. America's human rights policy is bigger than its counterterrorism policy. We should not judge the record on the basis of how the United States has fought terrorism. We have made good strides. In the last 10 years, the United States has been one of the largest supporters of the International Committee of the Red Cross, despite the fact that the Red Cross makes it a point to remind the United States and other governments of their commitments to international humanitarian law. The Obama administration has championed women's rights and reproductive health, children's rights, religious rights and other areas of central concern to the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world. And although the United States still refuses to become a full-fledged member of the International Criminal Court, it has begun to play a supporting role. When the United States speaks about human rights, other countries listen. We do not need a perfect score from Human Rights Watch to have our views respected. When other countries choose not to listen to the United States or follow its lead, it is not necessarily because we do not practice what we preach; instead, it is because those countries see human rights as a potential threat to their rule. Even if the United States had an unblemished human rights record, the Bashar al-Assads of this world are still going to massacre their people and authoritarian governments will still imprison and torture their dissidents. On the other hand, we must not redact the inconvenient truths of American foreign policy. Looking further back into our history, our record in international human rights is a mixed bag. During the Cold War, successive administrations indulged dictators on the grounds that it was necessary for containing Communism. Shamefully, the United States did not ratify the genocide convention until 1988. The Clinton administration did nothing to stop the Rwandan genocide in 1994. The world ratified the International Criminal Court in 2002 without our participation. The United States also has repeatedly censored its own views on China's human rights record for fear of hurting a key strategic and economic relationship. We're No. 1! We're No. 1! We're ... uh ... not? Even in better days, the United States has often made rotten compromises in the name of security. Simply put, the United States has championed human rights when it sees no damage to its security and economic interests. But when human rights are perceived as potentially detrimental to national interests, the United States has consistently chosen interests over values. America's support for human rights has had its ups and downs. Hopefully, in the future we'll see more ups than downs, and have more to celebrate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Barnett.","Michael Barnett: Fourth of July is also about celebrating our values, like human rights .

"(CNN) -- Cruz first. Carson second. Sound familiar? If it does, it's because for the second year in a row, the duo clinched the top two spots for the presidential choice vote in the buzzy Values Voter Summit straw poll. Last year, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas beat Dr. Ben Carson, a renowned neurosurgeon and Fox News contributor, by a whopping 29%. On Saturday, Cruz beat Carson just by 5%. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania rounded out the top four, while Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul tied for fifth place with 7% of the vote. To further the case that not much has changed, this year's results for the vice presidential choice also mimicked last year's, with Carson coming in first and Cruz coming in second. In a small twist, Jindal beat out Rep. Michelle Bachman for the third place title. She and Santorum took the fourth and fifth place spots in the race this year. Poll participants at the Values Voter Summit were also asked to rank their top three most important issues. To little surprise amongst the conservative crowd, protecting religious liberty was deemed the most important issue by an overwhelming margin, while abortion and national security followed as the next most important issues. Announcing the results, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative public policy and lobbying organization that sponsors the Summit, noted that participation was up this year from last, likely due to the upcoming midterm election. ""It actually shows that there is more engagement of core conservatives in the process when they have a reason to be,"" Perkins said. ""The evidence here is quite clear, that when conservatives have someone who will speak clearly, concisely -- a conservative message that embraces all elements of conservatism -- they gain enthusiastic support."" Voters were also allowed to write-in candidates that they thought were deserving of a vote if they weren't included in the list of 24 elected officials selected. Notable write-ins included Christian evangelist and missionary Franklin Graham for President. The Values Voter Summit is holding its 9th annual political conference in Washington through Sunday. The meeting draws thousands of conservative politicians and activists nationwide to hear speeches from featured guests and vote in the annual straw poll.","At the annual Values Voter Summit, Ted Cruz won the straw poll .

"(CNN) -- For months now, platoons of politicians have been filling the air with words. But today, if only for a few minutes, can we forget about the politicians and express our sympathy for one of the words? It's such an amiable word: a word that is friendly and easygoing and nonconfrontational, a word that would never want to get dragged into a fight like this. Yet it is there anyway, caught between practiced brawlers. The word? ""Moderate."" If you have found yourself paying attention to the presidential campaign that is going to be with us until November, you have heard the word. Repeatedly. Two of the candidates in the Republican primaries -- Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum -- have used the word regularly to assail one of their opponents, Mitt Romney. ""Massachusetts moderate,"" Gingrich has said of Romney, over and over, with unmistakable derision. Santorum has called Romney a ""mushy moderate,"" and has said that delegates at an open Republican convention ""are not going to nominate a moderate Massachusetts governor."" Now, Romney and Santorum and Gingrich are all experienced politicians. They know what they're doing, and they can duke this out among themselves. The purpose of today's column is not to discuss which of them would make a better president, or whether Barack Obama is a better president than any one of them would be. We'll find out about that soon enough. But just how exactly did ""moderate"" become a political dirty word? It doesn't sting -- you wouldn't think anyone would consider it a killshot. If one politician calls another a left-winger, or a right-winger, or a communist, or a fascist, or a radical ... now those are words meant to provoke. But to use ""moderate"" as a weapon? Is this really supposed to rile up the American people? Are voters supposed to say: ""I don't want that guy anywhere near the White House. He's a moderate!"" To most people's way of thinking, ""moderation"" has always meant balance, carefulness, calm deliberation, evenhandedness, dispassion, impartiality, judiciousness. It is traditionally a conscientious objector in the universe of bellicose language. Moderate weather is lovely weather. How are we best advised to eat and drink? In moderation. ""Moderation,"" in the world of words, is the common-sense good buddy, walking the straight and narrow. It has ever been thus, down through history. ""Out of moderation a pure happiness springs,"" said the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. ""Moderation in people who are contented comes from that calm that good fortune lends to their spirit,"" said the French author Francois de La Rochefoucauld. ""Keep a mid course between two extremes,"" said the Roman poet Ovid. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, may or may not have said the actual words that are often attributed to him -- ""Moderation in all things"" -- but he unquestionably believed in the principle. So what's going on here? In search of an answer, I turned not to Ovid or Aristotle, but to Cal Thomas, the conservative columnist and commentator whose love of language is as passionate as his interest in politics. Thomas is resolute in his conservative beliefs, but he has always shown a willingness to at least listen to the other side. He and liberal Bob Beckel write a regular column for USA Today called ""Common Ground,"" where they seek to find precisely that: a meeting place where ideas helpful to America may be worked out. So, Cal: What exactly does ""moderate"" mean as it is being used in the present political free-for-all? ""In today's vernacular,"" Thomas said, "" 'moderate' has come to mean that you have no fixed principles, that everything can be negotiated away because all that matters is 'the deal.' "" He continued: . "" 'Moderate' has also come to mean liberal on taxation, regulation and the social issues."" We were conducting our conversation by e-mail, so I couldn't see his face as he typed the next sentence. But, knowing his long understanding of politics and the people who practice it, I have a feeling he was smiling. Of ""moderate,"" he wrote: . ""It is a label that means whatever the person applying it wants it to mean."" In the current context, he's probably right. But will it work? Come the general election, will Americans band together and slam the door in the face of that dreaded quality, moderation? It would seem doubtful. This is a pretty centrist country. The one other time that moderation was referred to with such disapproval on the national political stage was in 1964, when Barry Goldwater, the Republican standard-bearer for president, famously said, in accepting the nomination: . ""I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."" What Goldwater was trying to get across was that one must fight for one's principles. He was echoing the words and stances of ancient Rome's Marcus Tullius Cicero and also of early America's Thomas Paine, who said: ""Moderation in temper is always a virtue; but moderation in principle is always a vice."" It was a distinction largely lost on the electorate. Goldwater was never able to recover from the controversy over that speech, and Lyndon Johnson -- whose strategists used Goldwater's words to hammer the thought into voters' minds that someone who spoke well of extremism might be an extremist -- won in a landslide. But this isn't about landslides or squeakers. It's about that mild-mannered little word that has suddenly found itself turned into an epithet. When the dust of 2012 has cleared, and the election is over, that word -- wounded, staggering, wondering just what in tarnation happened to it -- will do its best to go on with its life. It may even allow itself to get angry. Moderately. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Politicians have been tossing around the word ""moderate"" like it's an insult .

"(CNN) -- Last week, while most of the western world was focused on the approaching presidential election in the United States and a potentially disastrous hurricane making landfall in New Orleans, a group of seemingly small nations gathered on the Island of Rarotonga and changed the world. At the Pacific Islands Forum in the Cook Islands, 16 countries that when combined make up a tiny fraction of the world's land, came together and made some of the largest ocean commitments in history towards the sustainable management of their oceans, which conversely make up an immense 10% of the world's ocean area. In the last day of proceedings, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, an observer at the forum, pledged to deepen the U.S. relationship in the region by strengthening its conservation commitment between the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) and the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument (PRIMNM). Just before that news broke; the government of New Caledonia announced their intention to establish a 540,500 square mile marine protected area in their portion of the Coral Sea. But the most immediate and groundbreaking announcement came from the host country, the Cook Islands that unveiled a brand new marine park. At 386,000 square miles, it is equal in size to Egypt, is half of the nation's territory, and the largest marine park in the world. Such a marine park is even more incredible when you consider the relative scale of the commitment; the Cook Islands have a population of only 15,000 people, but an exclusive economic zone half the size of India. Imagine any other country setting aside a full half of their sovereign territory for conservation, recovery and sustainable development. It's unprecedented. This immense ocean-to-land ratio is shared by most ""small island nations"" in the Pacific â€” which should more accurately be called ""large ocean states."" This has been a stance and mentality that the leaders in the Pacific Islands have been cultivating. Two years ago, the forum leaders recognized the need to create a framework to unite their approach and their voice to manage their vital ocean resources. They unanimously agreed upon the concept of the Pacific Oceanscape, an unprecedented collaborative initiative encompassing nearly 40 million square miles of the Pacific Ocean and its islands. The Pacific Oceanscape hosts the world's largest remaining stocks of tuna, providing approximately one third of the world's catch, and is also the region that is first to see the environmental impacts on the ocean. The Pacific people are counting on developed nations to come together to reverse the threats of climate change and rising seas, which are already impacting these low-lying islands and vibrant cultures. I have been involved in conservation in this region for more than a decade. I first visited the Phoenix Islands with an expeditionary team to survey the islands in 2000 and returned in 2002 to conduct a second survey of the islands. The condition of the reefs and the quantities of fish and invertebrates mesmerized us. The most remarkable element for me was the large numbers of sharks, indicative of a healthy reef system. The experience left me in awe -- and gave us the inspiration to work to protect such a remarkable place. In 2006, I was proud to work with the government of Kiribati to establish the Phoenix Island Protected Area. With Conservation International's support PIPA was officially declared that year, codified by parliamentary law in 2008 and inscribed as the world's largest World Heritage Site in 2009. A few years later I joined Conservation International full time and have been able to continue its near two-decade-old efforts to support societies as they move forward on this sustainable development path and to help push forward the expansion of commitments to the Pacific Oceanscape. We have been fortunate to work closely with leaders and regional institutions to develop the Pacific Oceanscape initiative and are proud to have the global marine pioneer and innovator President Anote Tong of Kiribati as a Member of Conservation International's Board. We've also acted as advisors to the development of the Cook Islands Marine Park, the influence of which will be felt far beyond the Cook Islands. The park is the largest commitment ever made to the Pacific Oceanscape and as such will be a central feature of the framework. Every year for the past three years the Pacific Islands Forum has yielded further commitments to the management and protection of the natural resources the Pacific provides. After its close, I can see that the 2012 forum has provided the most ambitious international measures for ocean conservation the world has ever seen. I hope the waves of these monumental commitments are felt around the world and inspire other nations and regions towards such great goals. I can't wait to see how they top it in 2013. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Greg Stone .","Pacific Islands Forum saw new commitments to ocean protection .

"Washington (CNN) -- Wolf Blitzer and Donald Trump's heated showdown this week over claims of a conspiracy to conceal President Barack Obama's true birthplace was, at its core, an argument about lying. Trump and other ""birthers"" believe the president, mainstream media outlets, the courts and the state of Hawaii are all lying, conspiring in a cover-up that began with Obama's birth announcement in a Honolulu newspaper in 1961. Those who maintain the president was born in Hawaii -- and has produced an authentic birth certificate to prove it -- believe Trump and the other side are willfully ignoring the facts in front of them and spreading lies for political gain. Despite a frustrated GOP, anti-Obama 'birthers' still persist . ""It's very complicated, the way we process information,"" said Ron Riggio, an organizational psychology professor at Claremont McKenna College speaking broadly about the nature of lying. ""It's the politics of audacity. The more outrageous and audacious the lie is, the more people say 'that's got to be true because why would someone make something like that up?'"" While many politicians are truthful, honest public servants, too many politicians and their surrogates often lie, and voters often let them get away with it, Riggio contends. In the world of politics, lies are that relative no one really likes but everyone reluctantly invites to Thanksgiving dinner. From Richard Nixon -- ""I'm not a crook"" -- to Bill Clinton -- ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky"" -- to Marion Barry -- ""It's all made up... I don't know what happened"" -- to John Edwards -- ""The story is false... It's completely untrue, ridiculous"" -- American politicians have had a history of political deception, or at least stretching the truth. Edwards not guilty on one count; mistrial on other charges . In 2007, Edwards, who at the time was a leading candidate for president, lied about his mistress and baby when the National Enquirer caught him at the Beverly Hilton Hotel visiting the child. The jury in his conspiracy and illegal campaign contributions trial Thursday found Edwards not guilty on one of six counts. The judge declared a mistrial on the other five counts. And last year, disgraced congressman Anthony Weiner looked CNN's Wolf Blitzer in the eye and lied when confronted with evidence of illicit Twitter photos. He later admitted the deception and resigned from office. Birther satire: Prove Mitt's not a unicorn . ""From a leadership perspective, so often the lies politicians are involved in are part of leaving an impression about information,"" Riggio said. ""So much of it is the little white lies that are part of the social fabric. But when it crosses the line that the public truly believes is important, then it becomes a big problem."" Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colorado, found himself straddling the line between deception, confusion and evasion after reports leaked that he questioned the president's citizenship at a recent fundraiser. ""I don't know whether Barack Obama was born in the United States of America. I don't know that,"" Coffman reportedly said. ""But I do know this, that in his heart, he's not an American. He's just not an American."" Why does Mitt Romney continue to put up with Trump? The ensuing media storm over Coffman's comments forced the congressman to backpedal and issue a statement that he does believe Obama is an American citizen but that the president doesn't share the lawmaker's belief in ""American exceptionalism."" But Coffman's gaffe seems to fall more along the lines of what some behavioral experts call a dodge or an evade. ""Most dodgers, they're not lying. They just create a false impression,"" said Michael Norton, an associate business professor at the Harvard Business School who studies how and why people lie. ""Occasionally politicians get caught in a lie, but it's quite rare. If they are doing their jobs they don't lie, they just evade."" The Pulitzer Prize-winning PolitiFact website has made its mark by grading the shades of accuracy in politicians' statements on the ""Truth-O-Meter."" ""I think voters are well aware that politicians stretch the truth -- sometimes to the breaking point,"" said Bill Adair, editor of PolitiFact and Washington bureau chief of the Tampa Bay Times. ""And I think voters are also savvy enough to realize there are shades of gray that turn a seemingly accurate statement into a half truth."" However, unlike the days when webs of political deception were tougher to untangle, savvy voters now have more tools on hand. ""What's different today is that there is so much information available to help people make sense of the political discourse and discern the difference between an exaggeration and a pants-on-fire lie,"" Adair said. When Gilberto Hinojosa, who was seeking the Texas Democratic Party chairmanship, declared ""a large majority of the Republican Party believes that (Obama) is a Muslim and was born in a foreign country, was not born in the United States,"" at the Central Texas Democratic Forum last month, the would-be chairman rated a ""false"" on the Truth-O-Meter. Similarly, most claims about the president's birthplace as Kenya and the falsity of his Hawaiian birth certificate rate a flaming ""Pants on Fire"" on the Truth-O-Meter. Not that any of those ratings will convince Trump, those who agree with him or those who believe the president was born in America. And it doesn't matter how much or how hard either side defends their position, Norton said. ""We're much more likely to notice evasive behavior with politicians we already disagree with,"" Norton said. ""But we forget people in our party are doing the same thing.""","At the heart of the ""birther"" controversy is an argument about political lies .
Psychologists say politicians stretching the truth is ""part of the social fabric""
Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton and John Edwards have all been caught up in political deception ."
"(CNN) -- In the days and weeks ahead, we hope to learn more that will help us understand the tragedy that befell Virginia State Sen. R. Creigh Deeds and his family last week. On Friday, Deeds was released from the hospital four days after his son Austin ""Gus"" Deeds stabbed him repeatedly before shooting himself to death. Mental health officials initially said that after a psychological evaluation for the younger Deeds, they had been unsuccessful in finding a bed at a psychiatric hospital for him. But nearby hospitals later said that they had available space but were never contacted. The state of Virginia is investigating the matter and also conducting a review of state and local mental health services to determine if changes are needed. Much is still not known about that sad incident. But what we do know is that mental health care is an area that remains underserved; many who need care do not get it. For years, the mental health system has suffered from shortages of funding and political attention. Of the estimated one in five people who experience a mental health challenge each year, about 60% receive treatment. While the one-in-five number includes depression, anxiety, insomnia, eating disorders and substance use, it is important to note that those are the issues that people report to their doctors when they do seek help. Sometimes these symptoms indicate that there is a more serious problem that, if treated early, it can be key to preventing a disorder from reaching a crisis or leading to disability. The mental health system in the United States is fragmented, and reductions in public mental spending have resulted in severe shortages of services, including housing and community-based services. Since 2008, more than $4.5 billion has been cut from state budgets nationwide, and there are unmeasured challenges brought about by sequestration. These include reductions in block grants to the states for mental health and justice initiatives and cuts to Indian Health Services, which have resulted in fewer mental health counselors being hired. These cuts have placed even greater demands on programs that provide community treatment and crisis services. And while we don't know whether these difficulties played any role in the Deeds incident, we do know that years of discrimination toward people with mental health conditions has contributed to confusion about how to access care and often resulted in denied care. Fortunately, there has been significant progress in removing barriers and expanding and equalizing insurance coverage. The Affordable Care Act includes mental health care and substance use treatment as one of its 10 essential health benefits. That sends a strong message about the importance of mental health to overall health and wellness. Coupled with the just-released final regulations for the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, these changes will greatly improve access to care. We know that acute mental health inpatient services are very expensive, just as they are for the medical/surgical side of the health care equation. In recent years, there have been reductions in the number of community hospitals providing psychiatric care, as well as shortened stays. Treatment is increasingly being delivered in alternative/outpatient settings, as is the case for health care in general. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as coordinated community-based treatments are available. Community-based care, particularly when coupled with coordinated and supportive services similar to what is provided for other health conditions, produces better outcomes, helps people recover and reduces overall societal and medical costs. As part of their Medicaid plans, states such as Pennsylvania and Georgia are offering programs that provide alternatives to traditional services. They not only work well, they also cost less than not providing mental health services. For example, rather than having people experience long waits in overcrowded emergency rooms or forcing them to travel long distances, mobile crisis services are coming to adults and children (and their families) in their own homes in places as diverse as rural North Carolina, Minnesota and Tennessee, as well as in some of the nation's largest urban centers, including Los Angeles and Philadelphia. We know that community alternatives to traditional hospitalization are proving effective. In Lincoln, Nebraska, with its Keya House; at Rose House serving people in the counties north of New York city; and in multiple sites across Georgia, peer support and respite centers provide hospital diversion, a safe place for people in crisis and ongoing support to those at risk for a mental health crisis. Even New York City has recently added crisis alternative services. Legislators must make the commitment to restore the cuts to state mental health budgets. More state Medicaid plans and private insurance must add certified peer specialists to their plans to let people with state-provided nonclinical training help others stay on their medications and build social supports. Municipalities must better coordinate their mental health services and increase the number of mobile and alternative crisis services, and all community members need to understand that mental health is essential to overall wellness. We know what we need to do to head off tragedies and improve the quality of life for people with mental health conditions, and their loved ones. We need to find the political will to ensure that we address mental health with the same degree of attention as other health conditions, and provide the means and mechanisms to pay for it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Debbie F. Plotnick.","Debbie Plotnick: Much not known about Deeds incident, but mental health implicated .
She says mental health care inadequate in U.S., particularly with painful funding cuts .
She says Obamacare, Mental Health Parity Act will help, but community effort needed .

"(CNN) -- If you think school starts too early, you aren't the only one. A new policy statement published by the American Academy of Pediatrics is on the side of groggy students falling asleep at their desks and their parents who are tired of nagging them to get out of bed in the morning. They say that lack of sleep in adolescents causes poor academic performance and poses a serious public health concern. Traffic accidents, depression and obesity can result, with schools that start too early contributing to the problem. The technical report released with the policy statement says that sleep-deprived teens tend to eat more carbohydrates and fats, with every hour of sleep that is lost increasing the odds of obesity by 80%. Adolescents that go to sleep at midnight or later are also more likely to suffer from depression and have suicidal thoughts. On the other hand, middle and high schools that start later in the day tend to have students with less daytime sleepiness, less tardiness, fewer attention difficulties and better academic performance than early-starting schools. Sleep deprivation linked to depression in teens . Even if you don't have children in school, you might still be impacted if you drive to work. One community in Lexington, Kentucky, decreased the average crash rate for teenaged drivers by 16.5% after delaying high school start times by one hour, according to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine. And a two-year study of two high schools in Virginia found that the school with the later start time had significantly fewer students in accidents. Fatal wrecks underscore risks for young drivers . To reduce these public health concerns, the American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement recommends that schools start no earlier than 8:30 a.m. Only 14% of public high schools currently meet this guideline, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. ""I'm hoping that the visibility of the sleep deprivation issue and research can help spark more discussion,"" said Jennifer Davis, co-founder and president of the National Center on Time & Learning and former U.S. Department of Education deputy assistant secretary. When the topic of later school start times arises, parents and school administrators often express concerns over work conflicts -- How can I drop my kid off at 9 if I have to be at the office at 8:30? -- and after-school activities. Administrators say the school day needs to end early enough in the afternoon that sports team can share fields and practice before it gets dark. ""It's one more example of how are schools need to be student centered,"" Davis argued. ""There are thousands of children, bus schedules, lunch schedules, parent needs. But we have to focus on how we are going to help our children succeed. And making sure they have enough sleep is one of those things."" The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that adolescents get 8.5 to 9.5 hours of sleep per night, which parents can help enforce by setting bedtimes and limiting their child's use of electronic devices and social media in bed. ""Avoid keeping screens such as computers or TVs in your child's bedroom, and keep portable ones (phones, tablets, handheld games) out as much as possible,"" said Dr. Jennifer Shu, a board-certified pediatrician in Atlanta. ""It can be helpful to have a central charging station where all of the family's electronics spend the night."" She adds that parents can also encourage sleep routines such as reading before bed and avoid scheduling music lessons, sports and social events that might delay bedtime. Are your kids getting enough sleep? ""Setting the stage for good sleep now is an important habit that can make a difference in your child's future health,"" Shu said. If you have concerns, talk to a pediatrician or check out the National Institutes of Health's guide to healthy sleep.""","Sleep-deprived teens are at risk for obesity, depression and accidents .

"(CNN) -- As a drone with a sensitive camera scans an expanding search area for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, investigators are widening their scope to include other missing persons and murder cases. A suspect in custody has been connected to previous sexual assault allegations, and DNA evidence has linked him to the disappearance and death of another young woman in the same area where Graham vanished. At least four women have gone missing there since 2009. Graham, 18, was last seen in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall area on September 13. Investigators believe suspect Jesse Matthew, 32, was the last person with her. He is charged with abduction with the intent to defile. There have been no signs of Graham since. As the search for her and the investigation of Matthew continue, this is what we've learned so far: . Who is Hannah Graham? She's a native of Northern Virginia and tall -- 5 feet, 11 inches with a slender build. Graham has light brown hair, blue eyes and freckles. She was wearing a crop top when she was last seen. She's a second-year University of Virginia student making straight A's, her parents say. And she is a member of the ski team. She had been co-captain of her high school softball team. ""She was extremely smart, very witty, very athletic; she was musically inclined,"" her former coach Craig Maniglia said. She was studying pre-med, he said. There are also photos from a recent trip to France and comments from friends in French on what appears to be her Facebook page. Where was she the night she vanished? On the evening of September 12, she was seen at a party before friends saw her at an apartment complex a couple of blocks away. That was shortly before midnight, according to a timeline compiled by CNN affiliate WVIR. About 12:45 a.m. on September 13, a surveillance camera caught her outside of a pub, about three-quarters of a mile from the apartment complex. Other surveillance cameras captured her, as she ran past a gas station, walked past an Italian cafe and then by a jewelry store. At 1:20 a.m., she texted her friends to say she was lost and trying to find a party, WVIR reported. She and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1:30 and 2 a.m., WVIR reports. Police believe she may have been under the influence of alcohol, making her less able to defend herself. What is being done to find her? This is the first time in the state's history that an aerial drone has been used in a missing person search. Authorities are also offering a $100,000 reward for information leading her safe return. More than 3,000 tips to Graham's possible whereabouts have poured in. Police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back. More than 1,200 volunteers have searched around Charlottesville for clues leading to Graham. And the search area has expanded to include U.S. Route 29, outside of Charlottesville, where other women reportedly disappeared. Where is Hannah Graham? What other cases have come up in the investigation? DNA evidence has linked suspect Matthew to the death of a second woman, Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, who disappeared in 2009, authorities said. She was 20 at the time. Her remains were found on a farm months later. Investigators are also checking other unsolved homicide and missing person cases for possible connections: Those of Cassandra Morton, whose body was found in a wooded area near Lynchburg in November 2009; Samantha Ann Clarke, who was last seen on September 13, 2010; and Virginia Tech students Heidi Childs and David Metzler, who were shot to death in 2009. Route 29 seems to be a ghoulish common denominator. Harrington and Clarke disappeared along the corridor, where Graham also may have vanished. Alexis Murphy of Lovingston, Virginia, also vanished there. All the women were between 17 and 20 years old, CNN affiliate WVIR has reported. Another man, Randy Taylor, was convicted in Murphy's case in August 2013. He maintains he is innocent. And this week, his lawyer, Michael J Hallahan II, asked that evidence in the case be re-examined. ""This is not a fishing expedition, but rather this request is based upon evidence presented at Randy Taylor's trial and based upon these new developments relating to Matthew in the news,"" Hallahan said. ""Maybe it's him (Matthew), maybe it's not. It doesn't hurt to check."" In addition, in 2010, Harrington's case was connected to the 2005 kidnapping and sexual assault of another woman in Fairfax, Virginia. That woman survived her ordeal and provided police a description to make a sketch. Whether the drawing of an African-American male resembles Matthew would have to be left up to interpretation. Authorities check unsolved cases for ties to Graham disappearance . Has Jesse Matthew been in trouble before? Matthew has been accused of sexual assault twice before, when he was in college over a decade ago. A woman reported she was raped on the campus of Liberty University in Lynchburg on October 17, 2002. Matthew was a student at the evangelical Christian college for three years and played on the football team. However, no charges were filed because the woman didn't want to go forward with the case, and investigators determined there wasn't enough evidence to arrest Matthew. Matthew told authorities that the woman consented. There were no witnesses. This week, a ""criminal incident information"" report was released by Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, pointing to a sexual assault allegedly involving Matthew on September 7, 2003. Matthew quit the school's football team after the allegations and later left the school. When Virginia police first looked for Matthew for questioning in the Graham case, he went to a police station, and there he asked for legal representation. Days later, after police obtained an arrest warrant, Matthew was found more than 1,000 miles away on a Texas beach. He did not fight extradition in a Texas court and was taken back to Virginia. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Mike Ahlers and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","The area in which authorities are searching for Graham has expanded .

Polls had shown Warner, a popular former governor who'd been endorsed by his Republican predecessor, ex-Sen. John Warner, with a hefty lead. But Gillespie led Warner for much of the night as returns trickled in Tuesday -- and ultimately ended up trailing by less than one percentage point. Get ready: 2016 starts now .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The body shrouded in white with blue trim passed through the crowd of mourners who wept openly. Hearts broke as a small child was held up to kiss his deceased father goodbye for the last time. The boy was one of five children suddenly left fatherless. Eviatar Borovsky, 31, had no idea his life would end Tuesday at the beginning of his day. Israeli police say he was attacked at 8:30 in the morning doing the most mundane of tasks, waiting at his local bus stop. He died a violent death. Borovsky was a Jewish settler living on land in the West Bank that Palestinians say was stolen from them. He lived in the Itzar settlement, a community known to foster hard-core Jewish believers who have often clashed with their Palestinian neighbors. Borovsky thought where he lived was dangerous enough to carry a gun. Police say he had it on him when he was attacked but it ended up being used against him. Police say a Palestinian who had just been released from an Israeli prison for stone throwing attacked Borovsky by stabbing him three times, then snatched Borovsky's gun and shot him with it. It happened feet away from a checkpoint, under the watching eye of a watchtower. Other settlers who live in the area said they had been warning the government for a while that they needed more protection against Palestinian attacks. ""We are in an area where there are security threats. This is not the first time that a Jewish resident has been targeted by terrorism. Just a few months back there was a similar attack a teenage boy was also stabbed,"" said settler David Ha'ivri. In March 2011, Udi and Ruth Fogel and three of their children were killed in the West Bank. The tension between Palestinians and settlers in the West Bank are suddenly on high again. Retaliation for harm done by one community to another is a fixture of life. It is almost as certain as Newton's law: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The reaction came when young Jewish settlers began setting fires around the closest Palestinian village, Asira al-Qibliya. The settlers also lashed out by throwing rocks, by hand and slingshot, at the Palestinian villagers living below. Authorities said the Palestinian suspected in the killing wasn't from the village being targeted. But that didn't seem to matter. The Israeli army showed up and for a time played a cat and mouse game with settlers who were setting fires, throwing stones and running away. It was just a year ago Asira al-Qibliya was the scene of a shooting in plain sight of Israeli soldiers. A settler injured a Palestintian man in that incident. A Palestinian mother whose home happens to be on the front line of the war over land in that area took video of the May 2012 incident. She was out on her roof again this year watching as tear gas, stones and fires erupted below her. Her outer walls show scars of past battles. She begins to cry because she says she doesn't want her children to have to live in fear. ""It is a very difficult life, it's a life of suffering and always living in fear. I get agitated,"" said Khader Maklouf. ""I can't speak when I see my children, my daughters, afraid. It is something very difficult."" Residents say the difficulties had subsided for a time after the Israeli army moved into a small outpost over looking the area. Now both communities fear a return to a life where violence is the norm -- not the exception. A second stabbing incident . Another stabbing took place Tuesday in the Jersualem neighborhood of Mea Shearim, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. The assailants who stabbed a Palestinian man fled the scene, Rosenfeld said. The victim was taken to a hospital for treatment. Gaza airstrike . An Israeli airstrike in Gaza targeted a man suspected of taking part in the Eilat attack earlier this month, the Israeli military said. Israel Defense Forces said it targeted 24-year-old Hithem Ziad Ibrahim Masshal in the strike, and that ""a direct hit was confirmed."" But Ashraf Al Qudra, spokesman for the Palestinian health minister in Gaza, said the strike killed a 29-year-old hospital security officer riding on a motorbike. Another person riding on the bike was seriously wounded, medics said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said militant rocket attacks, like the one that prompted the Israeli airstrike, aren't acceptable and won't be tolerated. ""We will act, and are acting, in order to defend Israeli citizens,"" he said Tuesday. CNN's Kareem Khadder, Michael Schwartz and Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","Police: Palestinian man kills an Israeli settler in the West Bank .

"(CNN) -- If we can put a man on the moon ... I see it every day, the wonderment in the eyes of young children as they walk into the museum. They marvel at the pockmarked Apollo 11 command module or the shininess of the Apollo lunar module or the massive scale of the Space Shuttle Discovery. For them, nearly five decades later, anything is still possible. Forty-five years after the crew of Apollo 11 landed on the moon, millennials have now reached adulthood -- just as the baby boomers did in the 1960s -- and their kids still see hope in the stars. This historic anniversary shines through the decades, as a watershed of American ingenuity, determination and spirit. At the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, our visitors remind us every day that these qualities endure, as entwined as ever with progress in aviation, spaceflight and planetary science. Since our opening during the nation's Bicentennial in 1976, more than 325 million people have visited. The establishment in 2003 of our second location in suburban Virginia, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center -- where the Shuttle Discovery is now located -- has increased our patronage. We are recognized as the country's most visited museum. What is it about the history and science of flight that appeals to so many, transcending age and cultural biases? Public reaction to the moon landing offers clues. More than anything, it represented infinite potential. It was the first time in history that humans set foot on another body. It was an American endeavor, but a worldwide triumph. The Apollo 8 mission less than a year earlier set the stage for this powerful and galvanizing achievement because it inspired people to view the planet Earth in a new way. When its crew in lunar orbit focused cameras on Earth, humanity saw its home for the first time from far away, a small ""blue marble"" hanging in the blackness of space. So when Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon's surface in the summer of 1969, humanity recognized in an unambiguous way that the exploration of space was possible, achievable and inevitable. This recognition continues to inspire and motivate us, and will for decades to come. As the home of Armstrong's spacesuit, the Apollo 11 command module Columbia, and thousands of other artifacts related to aviation and space, we see firsthand how viewing these objects, and learning the stories behind them, resonates with children and people of all ages. Our mission -- to commemorate, educate and inspire -- applies not only to the artifacts we preserve, but also to the research we conduct in aeronautics, space history and planetary studies. The work our curators and scientists do serves as the foundation for exhibitions, programs, books, educational activities, online offerings, and live and broadcast programs. In the 21st century, our mission extends far beyond our walls, to reach the global community. For those of us 50 and older, the anniversary of the moon landing will undoubtedly bring to mind the memory of what we were doing when Armstrong stated those memorable words ""one small step for (a) man; one giant leap for mankind."" We watched the event on television, looked up at the moon, and half expected to see Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's movements from Earth. For younger people who have never known a life where Americans were not exploring space, who have followed the magnificent achievements of the space shuttle era and progress on the International Space Station, they know our adventure is still ongoing, one they will eventually inherit. At the National Air and Space Museum, the pride and optimism of Apollo 11 hasn't faded away. It endures, living on in the eyes of those kids. And now it's up to them. What transforming discoveries will they make in the next 50 years of the space age? What new technologies and new worlds will become routine for them and their children? Only one feature of spaceflight is inevitable: The unexpected will occur. Nevertheless, it is that sense of possibility that continues to excite us. The sky is no longer the limit.

"(CNN) -- The fall of the Berlin Wall, and the eventual disintegration of the Soviet Union, were overwhelmingly positive events -- a near miracle, in fact, given the potential for widespread chaos and violence. But as we prepare to mark the 25th anniversary of the Wall's fall, it is important to also remember some of the less pleasant side-effects. Indeed, this Sunday and beyond we have a responsibility to consider not only the joy and liberation of so many in Europe at the time, but also the repercussions that landmark event continues to have for the world today. For a start, it's worth remembering that not all Western policymakers were thrilled, at least in the early stages, at the prospect of the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. After all, although the Cold War offered a wretched global order, it was at least a form of order. And so it was not unreasonable for those who remembered at least one global conflict -- World War II -- to feel a little anxiety about state disintegration and the potential spread of nuclear weapons, among other things. But the end of the Cold War was not just about the break up of the Soviet empire. In fact, it involved three related but distinct events -- the end of a global strategic confrontation between NATO, the Soviet Union, and their allies and proxies; the effective end of a global ideological struggle between capitalism and communism; and the partial disintegration of the Russian Empire, of which the Soviet Union was simply the latest manifestation. The end of the global confrontation was as much, if not more, of a relief in what used to be known as the Third World, or non-aligned countries. It is easy for those who live in Europe and North America to forget that this ""cold war"" did not feel that way at all in swathes of Africa, Latin America and the Far East, where regional conflicts and civil wars both fed and were exacerbated by the wider tensions between the world's two great power blocks. And while it may be no comfort to the people of the former Yugoslavia, or the victims of the genocide in Rwanda, for example, the absence of such confrontation has contributed to the steady decline of conflict worldwide, as well as easing the considerable fears over a possible nuclear exchange and conflict. But the end of the ideological struggle arguably began a decade before 1989, with the partial conversion, at least in economic terms, of Communist China under Deng Xiaoping. In fact, one could argue that even before the late 1980s, the Soviet Union and its satellites were no longer trying to spread a credible alternative to capitalism, but were instead simply clinging on for dear life. (Although Soviet leaders might smile wryly at the scene now, where democracy has found its credibility battered by a global financial crisis and the seeming dysfunction of its political institutions). Still, as we are frequently reminded, the collapse of the Soviet Union was a traumatic and humiliating experience for many of its citizens, even if it also resulted in unmitigated jubilation for comparable numbers of others. Indeed, even today, the combination of the dramatic loss of global status, the perceived dismembering of its country by foreign powers, and the economic hardship many Russians experienced in the transition to the political system of their country's former enemy has produced a toxic cocktail for much of Russian society. The fact is that cynicism and arbitrary rule have displaced the heady optimism of the 1990s, and in many Russians' eyes, liberal democracy is (wrongly) considered to have been tried and thoroughly discredited. Such perceived failures have left us where we are now, in a new strategic and ideological confrontation between Russia and the West over Ukraine. However, unlike the Cold War, this tension is regional, not global, and it is portrayed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as being between ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" values, not capitalism and communism. (And it is also being fought mostly through non-conventional, economic and information warfare, rather than an enormous buildup of hard power, although a more conventional conflict has raged in the east of Ukraine). Why is all this worth remembering now? Because 25 years on, it is no longer satisfactory only to discuss what may have disappeared between 1989 and 1991 -- we must also consider what eventually replaced it. The harsh reality, despite the excitement and optimism at the time, is that the Cold War order did not give way to peace and prosperity across the world. Instead, we have a messier picture, with varying degrees of success and failure. From the war in Ukraine to the unrest in the Middle East, the West is faced with threats to its security that are less clear-cut than our confrontation with the Soviet Union, and also less predictable and much harder to understand. This is the reality we have inherited, and we must maintain our vigilance and be more creative in developing strategies to address the challenges we face.

"Washington (CNN) -- Attention, campers. National parks are becoming ""no drone"" zones. The National Park Service announced Friday it is prohibiting drones -- properly called unmanned aircraft -- from all NPS-controlled lands and waters. That includes 84 million acres in every state and territory, including monuments, battlefields, historic sites, seashores, rivers and trails. It all comes down to noise and safety, said Director Jonathan Jarvis in a statement announcing the policy. ""We have serious concerns about the negative impact that flying unmanned aircraft is having in parks, so we are prohibiting their use until we can determine the most appropriate policy,"" Jarvis said. The Federal Aviation Administration already has greatly curtailed the outdoor use of drones for commercial purposes, pending rules that it is developing. But hobbyists have been relatively free to operate drones in public areas, provided they stay below 400 feet and are flown away from populated areas and full-scale aircraft. College lends drones to students . A lawyer who represents drone enthusiasts called the NPS' temporary ban ""overly broad"" and said he expects it will be greatly narrowed when it goes through the federal rule-making process. ""It's very broad in that it sweeps in every national park-controlled location, including things like beaches and forests where there really aren't the same sensitivities to noise, and where model airplanes have been allowed for decades,"" said Brendan Schulman. The NPS said individual parks have been enacting drone bans for a number of reasons. Last September, an unmanned aircraft flew above visitors seated in the Mount Rushmore National Memorial amphitheater. Park rangers confiscated the drone because of concern for visitor safety, the NPS said. In April, a loud drone interrupted visitors enjoying a quiet Grand Canyon sunset. And volunteers at Zion National Park in Utah witnessed a drone disturb a herd of bighorn sheep. All previously issued permits for drones will be suspended until reviewed by a senior NPS official, who also must approve any new special use permits. Superintendents who have previously authorized the use of model aircraft for hobbyist or recreational use may allow such use to continue, the statement said. Schulman said Friday's action by the NPS also calls into question the validity of that fine, saying that the agency has stated it needs the new regulation because earlier regulations do not cover unmanned aircraft. In a separate case, Raphael Pirker earlier this year successfully challenged an FAA prohibition on commercial use of drones after the FAA fined him $10,000 for using a small drone to take promotional videos of the Virginia Medical Center. The FAA has appealed that decision. Florida university library to lend drones to students .","NPS announces temporary ban on use of drones .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner said President Barack Obama could get ""burned"" if he uses executive action to help undocumented immigrants. There are a good number of immigration activists who feel burned that he hasn't done it already. While they were pleased to hear Obama renew his vow Wednesday that despite Republicans' takeover of the Senate he still intends to use his executive authority to help fix the nation's broken immigration system, the message from immigrants' rights groups to the White House remains the same: They'll believe it when they see it. Advocates of immigration reform want the president to provide deportation relief to millions of undocumented immigrants since Congress has so far failed to pass a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws. It is hard to believe that a new Republican Senate and emboldened Republican majority in the House are likely to pass a bill that would pass muster with immigration activists. That leaves Obama and his promised executive action as immigration activists' only hope. They hope he'll keep his word. After promising on June 30 to announce the so-called executive actions he would take by summer's end, the White House delayed the move until after the mid-term election. Activists say they are tired of waiting and are planning a series of rallies, marches, conferences and other events to urge the president not to allow politics to delay action. ""Details matter and promises have been made before,"" said Cristina Jimenez, managing director for immigrants' rights group United We Dream. ""Our campaign to protect our communities will continue until the policy is changed in a way that includes our parents, families and neighbors."" At risk is not just the president's standing with the Latino community. Activists say this is an issue for all Democrats -- including potential 2016 candidates -- who some believe have taken Latino voters for granted. In a November poll by Latino Decisions, two-thirds of Latino voters said immigration was either the most important or one of the most important issues driving their vote this year and 60 percent of Latino registered voters who were not planning to vote said the delay in executive action made them less enthusiastic about the president and the Democratic Party. An October survey by Pew Research found that 55 percent of Latino registered voters disapproved of the way the Obama administration has handled the issue of deportations. ""The president's legacy is at stake,"" said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. Hispanic members of Congress who support reform point to the 2 million people deported during the Obama administration as they make their case for swift, expansive action. The president -- who has frequently been called the ""Deporter in Chief"" by immigrant groups -- used a Congressional Hispanic Caucus gala in September to repeat his promise to act before year's end. He again reiterated that promise at a post election press conference on Wednesday, just moments after incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned that doing so would poison the well with the new Republican controlled Congress. Still, some advocates are skeptical. ""There is nothing until there is something,"" said Marisa Franco, the lead organizer of the National Day Labor Organizing Network's (NDLON) #Not1More campaign against deportations. ""We're not going to stop the pressure until we see the president follow through."" And at least one former top Obama adviser urged the President to hold off on executive action in exchange for an up or down vote in the House. ""POTUS should agree to shelve exec order for up or down vote in House,"" Axelrod said on Twitter on Thursday. Immigrant groups say ""go big"" Several advocates who have been part of discussions with the administration, believe the president will use the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program he announced in 2012 as a model for future action. DACA allows immigrants brought here illegally as children to stay without fear of deportation and apply for work permits if they meet certain criteria. The president could expand this relief to potentially millions more people. Many supporters want the president to ""go big"" with a move that would include everyone who would have been allowed to stay in the United States under the bill the Senate passed in June 2013. That would mean an estimated 6 million to 9 million people could qualify. ""What they actually announce and who they decide to protect is not entirely clear at the moment, but what is clear is that the expectations are high,"" said Katy Green, a spokesperson for the advocacy group America's Voice. Advocates taking action . Activists are planning to protest in front of the White House on Friday to drive that point home. ""It's just the beginning,"" said Gustavo Torres, president of Maryland group CASA in Action and co-chair of the national Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM), at a press conference with other activists on Thursday, adding that more events are planned around Thanksgiving, including a hunger strike. Immigrant rights groups have been slowly ramping up pressure on the president. The Friday before Election Day, some two dozen United We Dream activists hailing from as far south as Florida and as far north as Massachusetts descended on the intersection opposite the White House. For half an hour they sat on the pavement amidst a cacophony of honking horns holding giant pictures of loved ones in danger of being deported. Some marched in circles chanting: No Justice, No Peace. Members of the same group interrupted the president repeatedly during a campaign stop in Bridgeport, CT days later -- including one who was wearing a t-shirt that said ""Obama Deports Parents"" -- and heckled potential presidential candidate-in-waiting Hillary Clinton at a campaign rally in Maryland earlier in the week. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, long an outspoken advocate for executive action,has already set up a ""Getting Ready for Administrative Action"" website with advice to help prepare undocumented immigrants for the president's announcement. It includes suggestions for the types of documentation immigrants can begin gathering to prove they qualify, once a plan is announced. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA) held a rally in Los Angeles Wednesday with community based organizations and labor unions to urge action now that the election is over. The group will host an immigration conference next month. ""Our hope is always that by Thanksgiving, people would sit around the dinner table giving thanks for the administrative relief-- and that by Christmas we will have no more separated families,"" said CHIRLA's Executive Director Angelica Salas. NDLON is planning a demonstration next week outside the Department of Homeland Security by people directly affected by deportations. The groups' plans go beyond pressuring the president. They also want to use rallies as well as Twitter and Facebook to make a case to the American public that bringing the undocumented out of the shadows is good for the economy and say it's also important to deliver that message to Congress, since only lawmakers can find a permanent solution to the broken immigration system. ""The best way to get that legislative outcome is for the president to put a marker down and let the Republicans respond,"" said Janet MurguÃ­a, the president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza. ""If they disagree, let them put their best foot forward on immigration reform and let's see what they will do.""","Immigrant rights activists say they hope Obama will act despite GOP Senate takeover .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Royal Courts of Justice agreed Thursday to send to the United States a man accused of helping organize a jihad training camp in Oregon. His legal team has been given time to appeal the extradition to the UK's Supreme Court. Haroon Rashid Aswat is wanted in a case dating back to 1999. Aswat, a British national, was arrested in Zambia in 2005 and sent to Britain, where he has fought extradition for years. His attorneys raised concerns about his mental health, according to British media reports. In a federal criminal complaint, prosecutors said Aswat participated in efforts to build the camp in Bly, Oregon, in 1999 and 2000. The camp ""would be a place that Muslims could attend to receive various types of training, including military-style jihad training, in preparation for a community of Muslims to make 'hijrah' (to immigrate) to Afghanistan,"" the criminal complaint stated. ""Once in Afghanistan, the men in the community would have gained enough familiarity with weapons at the Bly training camp to fight jihad in Afghanistan."" ""As it was used by the conspirators in this case, the term 'jihad' meant defending Islam against its enemies through violence and armed aggression, including killing the enemies of Islam, if necessary, in order to expel non-believers from holy Muslim lands,"" the U.S. Justice Department said in a 2007 statement on the case. Among his co-conspirators is radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, prosecutors say. ""We are pleased the court has upheld the Home Secretary's decision to extradite Haroon Aswat to the United States,"" Britain's Home Office said. ""The court agreed that the American authorities had provided sufficient assurances over the conditions in which Aswat would be held in the U.S."" In 2005, British authorities suspected Aswat of involvement in bombings on London Underground trains that killed 52 people. But he was not charged in that case. Background on Aswat .

"Washington (CNN) -- CNN's John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday on ""Inside Politics"" to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. One last Campaign 2014 maneuver and several intriguing post-election shifts and calculations made for a fun trip around the table. 1. New ground troops -- in Louisiana . There is one more round in the 2014 election, and Republicans are heavily favored: the Louisiana runoff for the U.S. Senate between Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy. So put this one in the ""taking nothing for granted"" file: A GOP source tells CNN the Republican National Committee is sending in 350 field workers to help with the December 6 get-out-the-vote effort. Democrats, too, say they will bolster their staff there now that all the other campaigns are over. But Landrieu faces a bigger question: whether to invite President Obama down for the runoff. He has been persona non grata during the election, but many party strategists think Landrieu's only chance is sky-high African-American turnout. 2. Watch out, McConnell: Cruz's 2015 plans . If Mitch McConnell, the presumed new Senate majority leader, is ever trying to find Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, he might just want to turn and look over his shoulder. The freshman tea party favorite makes no bones about believing that McConnell is too establishment and too accommodating. Jonathan Martin of The New York Times chatted with Cruz on election night and came away with the distinct impression Cruz will be tracking every McConnell move. ""I asked him about whether or not the party should try to sort of back off the repeal of the Affordable Care Act or try to compromise on immigration,"" said Martin. ""He said emphatically not, and in fact he said the only way to keep faith with the folks that elected them was to stand by the issues that had done so. And he said the biggest two issues for his party of the cycle were, A, repealing Obamacare, as he called it, and B, stopping the President's illegal executive action, as he called it, on immigration."" Next year, Martin points out, McConnell might be wishing Cruz finds himself in Iowa more often than in Washington. 3. And memo to McConnell: Enjoy it while you can . It long has been his dream job. Now, as McConnell prepares to rise to majority leader, the 2016 lineup suggests he might want to savor every minute. Politico's Manu Raju notes that the 2016 map is to Republicans what the 2014 map was to Democrats -- as in tough. ""There are a number of Republican senators that we are going to be looking at very closely on whether or not they decide to run again,"" said Raju. ""People like Richard Burr of North Carolina, Dan Coats of Indiana, Mark Kirk in Illinois. There are several others -- Chuck Grassley in Iowa."" Raju notes that if those GOP senators retire, then the Democrats have a chance to take those seats -- and maybe take back the Senate majority. 4. How Obama tries to get over a bad election -- head to Asia . Asia trips are a long haul -- a drain on any president. But Obama perhaps is dreading this one a little less, because it gets him out of a Washington buzzing about how the midterm election further weakened his political clout. So off he goes, but not without reminders that news travels fast these days. Julie Pace of The Associated Press notes that the Chinese, before they roll out the red carpet, apparently are eager to tell their people it is a weakened U.S. president coming to visit. ""Officials are right now increasingly nervous about the reception he is going to get in China,"" said Pace. ""There's a newspaper in China that's connected to the government that wrote a story before he left saying that the American public had 'downgraded' the President and was tired of his 'banality.'"" 5. Same leaders on Capitol Hill but ... Debbie Wasserman Schultz faced buzz in the middle of the campaign that the White House was less than thrilled with her performance as Democratic National Committee chairwoman. Now, as Democrats sort through the rubble of the results from their perspective, the ambitious Florida congresswoman is getting even more heat from fellow Democrats. Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post took us inside the debate over whether -- or when -- the DNC would be under new leadership. ""She has said she wants to serve out her term -- it ends in January 2017 -- and in some ways there's questions about whether or not she's close enough to Hillary Clinton, and whether she'd want her to stay on,"" said Henderson. ""But it'll be interesting to see whether or not she's able to stick it out or move on.""","Obama may get a lukewarm welcome in China .

"Brighton, England (CNN) -- A blurry Skype signal stirs to life. From a battlefront in northwest Syria a British jihadi fighter has a message for the mother of his childhood friend. ""I'd like to say to her that her son was a very loved person. We called him ""Khalil"" and that means friend. He was everybody's friend,"" 20-year-old Amer Deghayes told CNN. ""Khalil wrote a will and videoed a message for his mother on his mobile phone. He said to me 'if I get killed make sure you send this to my Mum.' But the phone was destroyed in the airstrike,"" he added. ""Khalil Al-Britani"" was the nom-de-guerre of Ibrahim Kamara, a 19-year-old from Brighton, a picturesque seaside resort in southern England. He was killed in Syria's Idlib province on September 23 as the U.S. unleashed a first wave of missile strikes on suspected ""terrorist"" positions. The U.S. and its coalition partners said they were primarily targeting ISIS. Washington says the targets it hit in Idlib belonged to a hardcore al Qaeda cell known as the ""Khorosan Group."" Deghayes, however, said his friend Kamara was, like him, a gunman in the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front -- a rebel faction battling the Syrian regime but also designated a ""terrorist"" organization by the U.S. News of Kamara's death was just the latest chapter in the tale of four Brighton youngsters, who, fresh out of school, headed to war. Amer Deghayes, now 20, is the eldest of four Brighton youths known to have gone to fight in Syria. He left a year ago after completing business studies at a college in Brighton. He told his father was going to do aid work for displaced civilians. Via Skype he told me a different story. He said he had been inspired by a primetime documentary on Britain's Channel Four television about British and European recruits taking up arms in Syria's civil war. Deghayes explained he thought it was his duty to do his bit in Syria -- part ""help thy neighbor,"" part Islamic obligation to go to the rescue of other Muslims in need. ""The Muslim nation is one body,"" he said. ""If one part is in harm then all the other parts go to rescue. It doesn't make much sense to me that people are being attacked and you sit at home and do nothing. Have the morals of life reached such a point that you only care for yourself?"" Three months later, apparently inspired by their elder brother's example, his two younger brothers, Abdullah then 18 and Jaffar, 17, headed out to join him. Ibrahim Kamara traveled with them. All joined the ranks of al-Nusra. The Deghayes were born and bred in Britain. Kamara fled battle-torn Sierra Leone with his mother when he was aged just five. He came to Britain after several years in Holland. The Deghayes and Kamara were longstanding school friends. Before he left for Syria, Kamara, 19, was studying computer science. His mother Khadija told CNN that Ibrahim, the eldest of her four sons, never had any problems with police and regularly helped her in the charity store she ran to raise funds to build schools in her native Sierra Leone. Khadija said her son was infuriated by what he saw as lack of international action to alleviate the suffering of civilians in the Syrian civil war. But he never told her he intended going there. ""Ibrahim called me on February 2 and said 'Mum I'm in Syria'. I just turned the phone off. When he called me again I said 'don't call me again.' I was really angry,"" said Khadija Kamara as she sat in her Brighton home. ""It wasn't just that I was angry with him. I just couldn't stand that my kid went to such a dangerous place. I didn't want to face it,"" she added as she sobbed into her headscarf. She says she reported her son's trip to Brighton police but officers said they could not help coax him back. British counter-terrorism police declined to discuss details of Kamara's case. Further checks revealed Kamara, who did not have his own valid travel papers, had stolen his 15-year-old brother Muhammad's passport. He reportedly flew from Luton airport with Abdullah and Jaffar Deghayes. It is not known what route they took into Syria. Khadija Kamara is flabbergasted that three Muslim teenagers, including one traveling on a stolen 15-year-old's passport, were able to make it out of Britain so easily. ""I couldn't save my son. He's already dead and I can't even bury him. But at least let me get the answer to this. How did he travel how did he go through the airport?"" she asked. ""How can a bunch of kids travel like that and nobody even suspected? This isn't about a religious thing, it's about all of us being responsible,"" she said. The British government has repeatedly said it will crackdown on what it calls the ""flow of foreign fighters"" to Syria. But this week, the Home Office told CNN it was the responsibility of individual airlines to check the identity of departing passengers not border police. When Kamara left with the two Deghayes brothers, their father quickly found out and trailed them to Turkey. He says he pleaded -- unsuccessfully -- with them to come home. ""They were very adamant they wanted to catch up with their brother. It was very painful, you feel very helpless. I told them stick to aid work and humanitarian work,"" said Abubaker Deghayes, speaking to CNN at his spacious home on the outskirts of Brighton. Deghayes, who rents and develops property, first came to the Brighton area from Libya when he was eight to learn English. He came to live in Britain as a political refugee when his father, a prominent opposition lawyer, was murdered in jail by the Gadhafi regime in 1980. Deghayes had made several trips to take aid to Syria. Years earlier he'd taken aid to Bosnia and Kosovo with Christian-led charity workers. But his younger sons did not stick closely to his footsteps. He found that out with tragic consequences in April. Abdullah was killed near the Turkish border in clashes with Syrian regime forces. Then, as last week with Kamara's death, it fell to the eldest of the Brighton jihadis Amer Deghayes to report back with the news. ""Amer told me Abdullah advanced into territory of the Syrian army then a sniper shot him in the chest. He fell on the ground and looked at the sky and laughed. That's how his brother describes it,"" explained Abubaker Deghayes. ""You feel he died a good death as a Muslim. As a martyr, he goes to paradise. But at the same time you feel sad for the loss. Abdullah was so young, he had so much in front of him,"" Deghayes said. His grieving may not be over. With the launch of U.S. and coalition airstrikes, the danger in Syria is rising. Now, his son Amer says al-Nusra is considering an alliance with its one-time rivals ISIS to confront the U.S.-led offensive. ""I very much doubt we will unite as a single group. But the scholars of Islam have come together to work toward a peace treaty between all groups since they see it's more beneficial to face the coalition,"" Amer said. He insisted, however, that al-Nusra still had serious differences with ISIS over its brutal tactics, particularly beheading hostages and attacking unarmed civilians. As the Skype signal with Amer Deghayes began to fade, he offered another detail to try and comfort Khadija Kamara, the mother of his fallen friend. ""Khalil (Ibrahim) is definitely buried in a nice place and he had a good burial,"" he said. As I visited Khadija, on a bright end-of-summer day, she seems resigned that she would never be able to bring her son for burial at home. So instead she imagines him at peace in some quiet corner, far from the battlefield. She tells me: ""I think they would have buried him in the mountain. And I say to myself, 'don't worry god is there in the mountains, god is everywhere. God have mercy on you my son.'""","Amer Deghayes, 20, is the eldest of four Brighton youths known to have gone to fight in Syria .

"(CNN) -- He may not play on game days, but Michael Sam -- the first openly gay man to be drafted into the NFL -- will at least have a home in the league once the regular season starts: the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys announced Wednesday they'd signed the former University of Missouri defender to their 10-man practice squad, a group that plays during the week with members of the 53-man roster but not during official games. That means Sam isn't likely to record a sack or tackle in front of national television cameras anytime soon. Even so, his signing -- in light of all the attention he has received, as a possible groundbreaker in pro football -- drew plenty of attention. Jerry Jones, Dallas' high-profile owner, president and general manager, cast the signing as a football decision for the club that is sometimes dubbed America's Team. ""The facts are that, if he's good enough to develop as a practice squad (player) and could evolve -- as many players do -- ... into a contributor, then that would be a plus for the Cowboys,"" he told reporters. ""That's it."" Jones touched on Sam's strengths and weaknesses, describing him as a ""relentless"" worker and pass rusher who ""is going to have to make for a little speed (and) make up for a little size."" ""But how many times have we seen that happen?"" the Cowboys' owner and general manager said. ""That's what makes football."" One thing that Jones did not express any reservations about is how Sam will fit in the locker room. He noted that his son, Stephen Jones, Dallas' chief operating officer and director of player personnel, is ""really close friends"" with Jeff Fisher, the St. Louis Rams head coach. The Rams drafted Sam -- an All-American defensive end in college -- in the seventh and final round of the NFL draft last May, only to waive him Saturday after four preseason games. Talking about what Fisher told the Cowboys executive about Sam, Jerry Jones said, ""He was an addition to their locker room, he brought a plus to the locker room."" Fisher praised the signing as ""a great decision by the Cowboys,"" especially given the injuries they've suffered recently on their defensive line. ""I hope Mike gets a chance,"" the Rams coach said. ""Maybe he can help them."" CNN's Wayne Sterling, Jill Martin and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","NEW: Rams coach calls Michael Sam's signing ""a great decision by the Cowboys""

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- On Tuesday, an American Airlines flight carrying 154 passengers slid off a runway while landing in torrential rain in Jamaica, stopping just short of the Caribbean Sea. The impact severely damaged the aircraft -- which broke into three separate pieces -- and caused the Boeing 737's engines to shear off the wings. Thankfully, there were no fatalities; 91 people were taken to hospitals where they were evaluated and most were released. On Wednesday, a Ryanair flight skidded off the runway in Scotland, coming to a stop 30 yards from a busy road. Amazingly, there were no injuries. These incidents bring to mind a series of high-profile commercial aviation accidents that occurred earlier this year. In January, the world watched in awe of the U.S. Airways ""Miracle on the Hudson."" In February, the nation mourned the fatal crash of a Continental Airlines flight over Buffalo and took note of a Turkish Airlines crash in Amsterdam where nine were killed and dozens more injured. With these incidents capturing headlines, some passengers are asking, ""Is commercial aviation safe?"" The answer is an unequivocal yes for two reasons. First, accidents are infrequent. According to the International Air Transport Association, there is one accident for every 1.2 million flights. Second, most aviation accidents are survivable. The National Transportation and Safety Board reports more than 80 percent of all commercial airline accidents are survivable. In fact, you are 15 times more likely to be involved in a fatal automobile accident than a fatal commercial airline accident. The reason: Most commercial aviation accidents occur on take-off or landing -- when aircraft are closer to the ground flying at relatively low speeds. Because the aircraft in these survivable accidents are still close to the airport, pilots often have more maneuverability to land the aircraft safely. In contrast, non-survivable aviation accidents occur when a catastrophic event takes place in the course of a flight, such as a serious mechanical failure, major structural failure or mid-air collision. The key to surviving a commercial aviation crash is remaining conscious during ""the golden time"" -- the critical 90 seconds immediately following impact. In a survivable crash, fatalities occur not only from the impact of the aircraft hitting the ground, but more frequently from smoke inhalation and fire when passengers cannot escape the aircraft quickly. Passengers can take certain steps to protect themselves in the event of a crash. The first step is to keep your seatbelt buckled at all times -- even when the flight is not experiencing turbulence. The precious seconds it takes to secure a seatbelt when an impact is pending may be too late. The second common step to protect yourself in the unlikely event of a commercial airline crash is to familiarize yourself with the safety features of the aircraft. While frequent fliers may ignore the pre-flight safety briefing, understanding how to properly operate safety restraints, locating the nearest emergency exit and following the flight crew's instructions in an emergency is critical. Decisions that are made in the seconds following impact can mean the difference between life and death. Another important factor in improving your chances of surviving a commercial airline accident is properly adopting the ""brace position"" when instructed by crew. The brace position stops your body from flying forward and striking the seat or interior in front of you which could result in a serious head or neck trauma. Those injuries could render you unable to escape the aircraft during the critical 90 seconds. The seats in commercial airliners are engineered to optimize safety. The distance between seat rows and the pitch of seatbacks are all designed to keep passengers secure during an impact. Aircraft manufacturers, airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration are constantly identifying new ways to make commercial air travel safer. To that end, a new FAA regulation took effect in October requiring the airframe and seat structure of all newly manufactured commercial airliners flying in the United States to safely absorb a crash of up to 16Gs (16 times the force of gravity). This is an update to the current 9G standard that has been in effect since the 1950s. Airlines are taking a number of measures to comply with this new regulation including adjusting the distance between seat rows and altering the pitch of seatbacks. One of the ways airlines are complying with the improved seating safety regulation is by installing a technology AmSafe developed to make survivable accidents even safer: the industry's first seatbelt airbag. It is exactly what it sounds like -- an airbag located in the lap belt of an aviation restraint. In a survivable impact, the airbag inflates in less than 90 milliseconds, moving away from the passenger to fill the space in front of them, protecting their head and torso. Aviation seatbelt airbags are designed to protect against head injuries; if passengers remain conscious they have a greater chance of safely evacuating the aircraft. While some people question the safety of commercial aviation, the safety statistics still hold. Flying in a commercial airliner is safer than driving to the grocery store in your automobile. But the industry must not stand still. Through passenger education, improved safety standards and the application of new technologies, everyone involved in commercial aviation must remain dedicated to improving safety any way they can. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bill Hagan.","Air crashes are extremely rare, says Bill Hagan, and 80 percent are survivable .

"(CNN) -- Silverstone, the host of the British Grand Prix, has unveiled a multi-million dollar revamp of their pit lane and paddock facilities called ""The Wing."" The $43m development began after Silverstone secured a 17-year contract to stage the British Grand Prix back in 2009. Part of the agreement stipulated the circuit must be upgraded and five former British world champions, including current McLaren driver Jenson Button, were on hand to help launch the new building. It has three floors and a distinctive wing at one end. Designed by the architects who were behind the London 2012 Olympic Stadium it includes 41 garages, a new media center, hospitality suites, a conference center and a new VIP spectator area. Button was joined by former British champions John Surtees (1964), Jackie Stewart (1969, 1971, 1973), Nigel Mansell (1992) and Damon Hill, the 1996 title holder, and head of the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) which runs Silverstone. He said: ""The official opening of the Silverstone Wing represents the culmination of many years hard work and gives a clear statement of intent for the future. ""Silverstone has a significant historical legacy, but we maintain our place at the forefront of contemporary international motor sport, hosting an array of world class events and activities. ""This is in no small measure because British competitors have consistently led the way at the highest level of global motor sport for over eighty years. ""The BRDC is extremely proud of this new building, but we acknowledge that none of it would have been possible without our superb and exceptional Silverstone team. ""Silverstone is a cornerstone of our industry and the BRDC will continue to develop the circuit to ensure that Britain has a world class home for motor sport and related technology."" Silverstone staged the British Grand Prix from 1948 onwards but was stripped of the race in favor of Donington Park in 2008. After concerns the new venue would not be ready in time Silverstone was handed a 17-year contract a little over 12 months later. Formula One rights holder Bernie Ecclestone, who insisted on the pit lane development when re-awarding Silverstone the British GP, called the opening of 'The Wing' an ""important day for Formula One."" He added: ""The new pit and paddock complex is a state-of-the-art facility and will form the backbone of Silverstone's plans to be a world class facility of its type. ""I am delighted with the progress and prospects for the future of Silverstone. It is a great shame that it could not have been completed 10 years ago, but well done Silverstone.""","Silverstone unveils a revamped multi-million dollar pit lane and paddock complex .

"(CNN) -- For all the difficulties of the Affordable Care Act's rollout, Americans are more patient than you might think: A new poll shows a majority expressing optimism that the problems are going to be ironed out. Not only that, a majority continues to support the law or think it didn't go far enough. Nevertheless, the conservatives rooting for its demise have been expressing not just vindication, but triumph. ""We could be looking at the collapse of American liberalism,"" said columnist Charles Krauthammer. ""Liberalism is crumbling in front of our eyes,"" echoed Michele Bachmann. Yes indeed, a glitchy website and people moving from junk insurance to real insurance prove once and for all that government should have as little to do with health care as possible, and the entire liberal project lies in tatters. That's a little like proclaiming that your team will inevitably lose the World Series, then go bankrupt and disband because the other team scored a run in the first inning of Game 1. But the momentary political situation aside, conservatives still face a fundamental problem when they confront America's health care system. Their ideology dictates only one solution to all health care problems, and that solution -- less government, more free market -- is exactly what gave us our dysfunctional health care system in the first place. Let's step back a moment to consider why we needed the Affordable Care Act and what it says about the health care market. The basic conservative position is that the more you let market forces operate, the better the outcome will be. ""More markets"" is the answer to everything: Let people buy insurance across state lines. Make it virtually impossible to sue for medical malpractice. Create more health savings accounts. But where do you think the problems of America's health care system came from? It wasn't government that gave us nearly 50 million uninsured Americans and denials for pre-existing conditions. It wasn't government that gave us the yearly and lifetime caps on insurance coverage that have sent so many people into bankruptcy when they've faced a serious illness or accident. It wasn't government that gave us ""rescissions,"" where your insurance company cancels your policy if you get sick. It wasn't government that gave us a system in which the gap between what we spend and what we get is so enormous. It was the free market. The conservatives who profess to love markets so dearly seem unable to grasp that the market for health care isn't like the market for shoes or cars. Other developed countries understand this. Every one of our peer nations has a system with more government control than ours, ranging from almost completely socialized systems like Great Britain's to ones like those in Switzerland and the Netherlands, which resemble Obamacare but with tighter regulation. We don't have to wonder whether a health care system built on capitalist profit-seeking is more efficient and less expensive than those in which the government exercises more control. There has been a test running for decades, with many developed countries doing it one way, and the United States doing it the other. The results couldn't be clearer. On almost any criterion you can come up with, the government-controlled systems work better. They cover everyone, while spending far less than we do. Their health outcomes are as good or better than ours. A recent Bloomberg News analysis rated America's as the world's 46th most efficient health system, right above Serbia and right below Iran. Among the developed countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.S. ranks first (by a mile) in health spending per capita, but 26th in life expectancy. There are some, however, who love the American health care system. American doctors make far higher salaries than their counterparts in other countries. American insurance companies do very well. As a recent New York Times investigation revealed, makers of devices like artificial hips mark up their prices double, triple, or even more when they sell to American hospitals as they do when they sell the same devices to European hospitals. The same is true of a hundred other devices and procedures. Why? Because in Europe, Japan, and other places with highly regulated health care, government rules keep the costs low. In the American system, there are multiple points where companies do the rational thing: Extract as much money as possible from the system. That's why an MRI costs three times as much in the U.S. as it does in France or Holland. But people living under the oppression of those other governments' systems must hate them, right? Wrong. The Commonwealth Fund recently released a study of health systems in 10 developed countries around the world which included a survey of satisfaction. America's health system was the least popular, with only 25% of Americans saying it works well and the other 75% saying it should be fundamentally changed or completely rebuilt. The most popular was the most socialized, Great Britain's, with 63% saying it works well. You may remember that the opening ceremonies of the 2012 summer Olympics in London included a tribute to the National Health Service, so proud are Britons of their health system. Despite all the problems created by America's private health care market, we do have versions of big-government, socialized insurance. They're called Medicare and Medicaid. They are far more efficient than private insurance, and Medicare recipients in particular love their coverage. It's no accident that in every election, Republicans -- who fought against the creation of Medicare and would love to privatize it -- try to pretend to voters that they're the program's greatest defenders. The champions of free-market capitalism decide they can't get elected without supporting a single-payer insurance program. In all their glee about the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act, most Republicans are barely bothering to offer an alternative, other than a return to the way things used to be. It isn't surprising, because to be brutally frank, they never much cared about the spectacular human suffering created by free-market health care. For decades, liberals have been working to devise policy solutions and create the political conditions for health care reform that would achieve secure, universal coverage. On the other hand, in the face of millions who can't get insurance because of pre-existing conditions and millions more who just can't afford it, the conservative response was always, ""Whatever."" The market spoke, and you lost. Too bad for you. The Affordable Care Act can certainly be improved. But in health care -- to paraphrase Ronald Reagan -- the free market isn't the answer to our problems. It is the problem. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Waldman.","Paul Waldman: Americans still optimistic Obamacare will be fixed; conservatives hope not .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Famed for keeping people slim, healthy and living longer, the Mediterranean diet has followers all over the world. Cultural treat? Moves are underway to get the Mediterranean diet on UNESCO's world heritage list. However, the diet is being increasingly shunned by people who live in the Med as the convenience of fast food gains popularity. The renowned low-fat, high-fiber diet has ""decayed into a moribund state"" in its traditional regions, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). So sharp is the decline that governments from the region are scrambling to protect their traditional fare from becoming an ""endangered"" species. Populations surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, such as Greece, Spain and Italy, tend to eat these foods, and governments there have joined forces to apply for their diet to be placed on the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) Heritage list. Those lobbying for UNESCO protection have argued that its inclusion would ''fend off the watered-down clones assailing its integrity worldwide in this age of killer fast food.'' The UNESCO list is famous for including historic and cultural sites but in recent years the UN body has opened its register to include ''intangible heritage,"" such as endangered languages or vanishing traditions. ""The Mediterranean diet is a heritage that should be protected and shared,"" Paolo de Castro, a former Italian Agriculture minister, said earlier this year. ""Science has long recognized the unusual health properties of the diet, which has strengthened and accompanied the common cultural identity of Mediterranean countries,"" he said, according to Italian news agency ANSA. ""The diet is an integral part of the historical and cultural identity of the Mediterranean, and an opportunity for growth for the countries in the area."" Originally considered the diet of the poor, who didn't have much money to buy meat, the ""Mediterranean diet"" is rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, cereals, whole grains, fish and olive oil. Numerous studies have associated it with long life-spans and low rates of cancer, heart disease and other ailments.  See a comparison of the old and new diets in Mediterranean countries » . However, some fear that it has become supplanted by supermarket ready-made foods and fast food as people have become more cash-rich and time-poor. ""The European diet has become too fat, too salty and too sweet,"" senior FAO economist Josef Schmidhuber concluded in the group's report on the European Union diet. The FAO's 2008 report ranks Spain as the country with the biggest leap in fat consumption in Europe -- from 25 percent of the diet 40 years ago to 40 percent now. EU and Mediterranean countries with the worst dietary changes are Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and Malta, where calorie intake has increased by 30 percent in the last few decades. Three-quarters of the population of Greece is overweight or obese, while in Spain and Italy the number is more than 50 percent. In the U.S., 66 percent of the population fits into this category. Alarmed by the growing health problems associated with obesity, Spain's Health Ministry has launched a series of initiatives to combat obesity. In 2007, it ordered fast-food chain Burger King to remove ads for its Big King XXL, which contains 1,000 calories, and which were aimed at teenagers and young people. A 2001 report by Foodservice Intelligence, a London-based market research firm, found that traditional-style restaurants in Italy and Spain were outnumbered two-to-one by their fast-food counterparts. UNESCO will decide whether to include the Mediterranean diet in its Heritage list late next year. Until then, Spain and other countries in the region undoubtedly will hope they can retain their reputation as a rewarding destination for the gourmet traveler.","Mediterranean diet has declined into a ""moribund state"" according to the U.N.

"You could blame weeds, trees, and grasses if you start itching, sneezing, coughing, and wheezing this fall. But the usual suspects aren't the only triggers. A host of household items -- candles, chemicals, stuffed animals, and spices -- may be the real culprits. From blue jeans buttons to limes to teddybears, allergy triggers  come in many ways, shapes and forms. ""Many homes are filled with irritants, and if there's a high enough count of an irritant, you'll react,"" says Christopher Randolph, M.D., an allergy expert and professor of pediatric immunology at Yale University. Here, a rundown of 11 sneaky suspects -- and how to stop them from bothering you. Candles . You can't be allergic to essential oils -- which make candles smell like autumn leaves or dune grass -- but their odors can inflame your nasal cavities, according to James Wedner, M.D., chief of allergy and immunology at the Washington University School of Medicine. ""People with nasal allergies have a natural increased sensitivity, so they're likely to get a runny nose or watery eyes around candles,"" he says. ""To the person with the sensitive nose, it's no different than cigarette smoke."" What to do: If you're very sensitive, avoid candles altogether. But if you love the smell and want to use them at home, buy candles that have few ingredients and feature just one scent, such as pumpkin. By a process of elimination you may be able to pinpoint which scent or ingredient bothers you. (Smoke from candles can also be an irritant, though that usually comes from snuffing it out; open a window or blow out the flame outside.) If you have a bad reaction to a scented candle, getting some fresh air should make you feel better. Perfume . Fragrances can contain hundreds of chemicals that are mostly untested on humans, Wedner says. When those chemicals bond with the essential oils in perfumes and are then sprayed into the air, sensitive people may take offense. Sneezing, congestion, and headaches can be the result. What to do: Kindly ask your colleagues to go easy on their favorite fragrances, and bring a portable fan to keep your area as scent-free as possible. If the thought of not wearing a fragrance leaves you blue, stick with body creams and moisturizers that have light scents. These are less likely to irritate you. Soaps and detergents . You think it's the chemicals in cleaning products that make you itch? Surprise: ""The majority of skin sensitivities are caused not by the cleaning agent but by a perfume additive,"" Wedner says. ""And nearly every soap now has some sort of plant in it to make it fancy -- roses, elderberries, etc. The skin can respond with irritation, and give you a rash."" Read more on how to identify a rash . What to do: Buy organic or specially marked soaps; look for ""no additives,"" ""nonscented,"" or ""phthalate-free"" on the label. Phthalates are chemicals that help improve texture, but they've been linked to allergic reactions; products that contain them may have ""diethylphthalate"" or something similar on the label. Dove, Tide, and Ivory all offer low-irritant products, as do many organic brands. If fabric softener seems to be giving your skin fits, try using a sheet of aluminum foil in your dryer instead; this trick will get rid of static cling. Or use a scent-free, no-additive version, like Seventh Generation Free & Clear Natural Fabric Softener. If you're in a public laundromat, wash and dry towels first, which will soak up the residue left behind by previous users. Then be sure to use that same washer and dryer to clean and dry your clothes. Stuffed animals . Dust mites living in mattresses and pillows are a huge allergy trigger. Roughly 15 percent of the population is allergic to these microscopic bugs. Encasing mattresses and pillows with impen­etrable covers and cases is a useful step, but it's not enough. The mites also love kids' favorite furry toys. What to do: Wash, dry, then repeat ... and use very hot water. ""Toys should be washed at 140 degrees, which will ensure that the mites are killed,"" Randolph says. After they're clean store them on a shelf, not on the bed. What to do with the nonwashable toys? Every two to three weeks put them in a plastic bag in the freezer for a couple of hours, which will also kill the mites. Carpeting . You may love the feel of carpeting under your feet, but mites find it just as attractive. ""Even if you vacuum constantly, you've still got mites,"" Wedner warns. What to do: Remove wall-to-wall carpeting -- who doesn't like a beautiful wood floor? -- and use small rugs that can be washed in hot water monthly. ""And keep the humidity below 50 percent"" with your central air system or a dehumidifier, Randolph says. ""Dust mites thrive in humidity."" Read more on how to allergy-proof your house . Spices . They add nuance and zing to a variety of dishes, but there's no getting around spices' origin: pungent plants. For some people, eating the spices made from these plants leads to a just little sniffling. For others, it may cause itching, swelling, and even burning of the lips. What to do: Avoid the spices more likely to cause trouble: coriander, poppy seeds, pepper, dill, paprika, cumin, and saffron -- which, in broad strokes, means Indian and Middle Eastern food. If you're not sure which spices bother you, record what you've been exposed to each time you have symptoms and look for the common denominator. Need help planning an allergen-free Halloween? Read on for some tips . Christmas trees . A word to the wise before the holidays: Mold grows fast on Christmas trees. ""When you put that tree in a bucket of water, invisible mold grows almost immediately,"" Wedner says. ""Most people are allergic to or irritated by mold spores."" What to do: Try a fake tree. Can't live without a real one? Ask when it was cut down before you buy it; trees that were cut weeks in advance are already ripe with mold. Then, starve it of water and keep it for as short a period as possible. Mold grows on houseplants, too, so keep them on the dry side. Wall paint . The solvents and synthetic resins used in paint often lead to itchy eyes and headaches. Oil-based paints are a particular problem because they can continue releasing chemicals even after they dry. What to do: Keep windows open as often as possible and allow fresh air to circulate for four weeks after painting, no matter what kind of paint you use. ""Once it has dried -- and I mean really dried, weeks later -- the odor goes away, and you won't have a problem,"" Wedner says. If possible, use latex paint, which emits less gas than oil-based kinds due to its water base. By the way, there isn't any real latex in latex paint, so if you're allergic to latex gloves the same won't apply to the paint. What about paint with low levels of VOCs (volatile organic compounds)? They spew fewer chemicals into the air and are less smelly than regular paints. But that doesn't mean they won't bother you. To find these paints, look for the ""Green Seal"" certification mark on the label. Alcohol . An actual allergy to alcohol is quite rare, but being allergic to the grains and additives used in liquor is not: wheat or the preservative sulfur dioxide could cause a rash or a stuffy nose. New York City allergist Wellington Tichenor, MD, founder of the information site Sinuses.com, also blames grains like corn, bar­ley, and rye, as well as fruit flavorings. Wine and beer may create problems, too. What to do: Stick with grain-free liquors like potato vodka, rum (made from sugar), and tequila (the agave plant). Skip all flavored liquers. And if sulfite preservatives in wine bother you, red wine tends to have fewer preservatives than white. Also, look for wine labeled ""sulfite-free"" (it won't stay fresh for long). And remember that anything with carbonation (like a wine cooler) increases the likelihood of an allergic reaction, Tichenor adds. Blue jeans buttons . The buttons on your jeans are probably made with the metal nickel -- a rash trigger for up to 20 percent of women. A nickel rash near your waistline is usually itchy, red, and sometimes blistery. What to do: Take your pants to a tailor and have her replace the nickel buttons with plastic ones (another metal might also cause irritation). A second option: Coat the button with clear nail polish, a remedy found to be effective in a recent St. Louis University study. Just be aware that nail polish itself may lead to a rash if you're sensitive to it. Lemons and limes . Limonene, a zesty compound in lime and other citrus fruits, gives many people watery eyes and a burning sensation in the nose, Wedner says. It might even irritate your skin, whether you touch it or eat or drink products containing limonene. What to do: If you get a rash, treat it with topical hydrocortisone creams used for bug bites and poison ivy. Skip the lemon or lime wedge with your drink or salad, and look out for lime in salad dressings, desserts, and marinades (it's used in numerous dishes).

"(CNN) -- Back in 1994, when Newt Gingrich led the GOP to take over the House, it was historic. A sea change. An earthquake. Why? Because Democrats had held control of the House for the previous 40 years. As in four decades. Imagine that. Hard to believe it ever worked that way. Now voters demand change elections more often than they don't. Consider this: Republicans win the Senate in 2002, then lose it in 2006. The Democrats hold the Senate until losing control of it last night -- predictions are that they might be in a good position to take it back in two years. At some point, someone might start listening: Voters are steaming. They're anxious. They're also not expecting Democrats and Republicans to suddenly write poetry together. But here's one thing they do expect: competency. As in: figure out a way to do your job without continually kicking the proverbial cans down the road. In a pre-election interview with CNN earlier this week, Vice President Joe Biden told me that the ""President and I have to figure out how to better communicate."" That may be true, but what happened last night is not a communications problem. It's a governing problem. Almost 8 out of 10 voters who voted yesterday don't trust the government to do the right thing -- and the president runs the White House and his party controlled the Senate. So the voters, done with hope, voted change. The reason these races went down to the wire -- until the tidal wave became obvious when Democrats couldn't elect governors in blue states -- is that the voters didn't like either the Democrats or the Republicans. But, as it turns out, when given the chance to express a preference, they decided they disliked President Obama the most, and sent the message loud and clear. Sure, the larger issues of the economy and health care loomed large. Two thirds of the country thinks the nation is headed down the wrong track. But the signal was loud and clear to Washington: Figure out a way to get us going in the right direction. Oddly enough, for a midterm election, the turning point came on a foreign policy matter. Sources in campaigns for both Democrats and Republicans tell me they agree on this: When the President said he didn't have a strategy for ISIS in Syria in late summer -- and then followed up by saying the administration had underestimated the strength of ISIS -- polls started to shift. Then came Ebola, and the shift continued. ""After he said that stuff, we all began to look at it very hard,"" said one GOP strategist with a couple of wins under his belt today. ""It was about refusing to take bold steps on big problems. It wasn't a fluke, and that's what we drove home."" It worked. With one Republican strategist describing the disastrous Obamacare website rollout as ""The Number One driver"" of the competency issue, the narrative was set. Obama seemed afloat, the world out of control. And a Democratic strategist confirms their numbers starting going south at that time too. ""It was like defying gravity,"" he told me. And that's exactly why Democrats separated from Obama. Only it didn't work. The question for Democrats now is whether the Obama coalition survives without Obama. Right now, the party looks like a group of managers who have sliced up the electorate into gettable constituencies: women, minorities, young voters. But in this election, the Republicans had a fresher playbook -- talking to suburban women worried about health care, with a good pack of candidates, and an improved political operation. Here's the rub: For a midterm election, it works to be the party simply against the incumbent. But there wasn't any Republican game plan for the future. And there sure doesn't seem to be a Democratic one, either. At some point, the voters have to start believing the government -- and the people who are supposed to be running it -- works. Or they will hold their noses and vote for change. Again.","Gloria Borger: Voters are much less patient with politicians than in the past .
They want a government that will act effectively to solve problems .
She says strategists saw Democrats lose ground in polls after Obama's ISIS strategy comment .
