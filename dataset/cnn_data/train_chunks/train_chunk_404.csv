"President Barack Obama on Saturday nominated Loretta Lynch as his next U.S. attorney general, describing the two-time U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York as a ""tough, fair and independent"" lawyer. ""It's pretty hard to be more qualified for this job than Loretta Lynch,"" Obama said at the White House, where he was joined by Lynch and outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder. ""I can think of no better public servant to be our next attorney general."" The president said the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Lynch twice before as a federal prosecutor. ""It's my hope that the Senate will confirm her for a third time without delay,"" he said. ""Loretta might be the only lawyer in America who battles mobsters and drug lords and terrorists and still has the reputation for being a charming people person,"" the president said. Lynch, 55, said she was both thrilled and humbled, and thanked Holder for ""leading by example"" and ""pushing the department to live up to its name."" The first African-American woman to hold the nation's top law enforcement post, Lynch vowed ""wake up every morning with the protection of the American people my first thought."" The nominee, when confirmed by the Senate, will replace Holder, who announced his plans in September to step down. At the White House, Obama praised Holder, calling him ""one of the longest-serving attorney generals in American history, and one of our finest."" Lynch is a popular prosecutor who is in her second stint as U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, appointed by President Obama in 2010 and also serving in the same post from 1999 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. ""She has made her name as work horse, not show horse,"" said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, who worked with Lynch as a junior prosecutor in 1990. ""She is someone who tried cases as a junior prosecutor, ran the Long Island office and then was promoted to U.S. attorney for all of the Eastern District of New York. It's a job that is not terribly glamorous, especially compared to the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, but it's a job that she has done twice,"" Toobin said. Lynch would be the second woman to serve as attorney general and the second African-American to hold the post. Lynch served on the trial team that prosecuted and won convictions in 1999 against New York City police officers for violating the civil rights of Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant whom police officers beat and sodomized while he was in their custody. That experience could help at the helm at the Justice Department, which is overseeing high-profile civil rights investigations, including one into the Ferguson, Missouri, police shooting of Michael Brown. ""She's absolutely not a partisan lawyer,"" said Julie Myers Wood, CEO at Guidepost Solutions and one of Lynch's first hires as a federal prosecutor. ""I am a Republican, but she doesn't care if people are Republicans or Democrats. She cares about getting the job done."" Lynch has quietly built a solid reputation in New York, where Preet Bharara, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, garners magazine covers and regular media attention for Wall Street prosecutions. In a statement, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton called Lynch ""a remarkable prosecutor with a clear sense of justice without fear or favor."" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement that Lynch ""has time and time again demonstrated her commitment to ensuring there is one set of rules for everyone and to defending the principle of equal justice for all."" Her 2010 nomination won Senate approval on a voice vote, meaning Republicans didn't view her as controversial. In recent months, however, she has led the prosecution of Rep. Michael Grimm, R-New York, for alleged tax fraud. Grimm won reelection this week despite being under indictment, and has called the case against him politically motivated. Lynch was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate to be a U.S. attorney in 2010, but GOP aides said initially Friday they don't know that much about her. Regardless, the scrutiny she will receive to become the nation's top law enforcement official will be much greater than when she was picked to be one of 93 U.S. attorneys. Lynch was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, and earned her undergraduate and law degrees at Harvard University. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who becomes majority leader in January, said in a statement that a decision on the nomination should be made in the new Senate in January. ""Ms. Lynch will receive fair consideration by the Senate,"" he said. ""And her nomination should be considered in the new Congress through regular order."" In a joint statement, Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah said Lynch should state whether she believes Obama's plan to sign an executive order overhauling immigration laws was ""constitutional and legal."" The statement also said Lynch ""should not be confirmed in the lame duck session of Congress by senators who just lost their seats and are no longer accountable to the voters."" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is poised to chair the Judiciary Committee in the new GOP-controlled Senate, and other top Senate GOP leaders never got word about the expected nomination from the White House, according to aides. ""It'd be nice if the White House called to let us know,"" one aide grumbled to CNN. While the administration is not required to inform Congress in advance about Cabinet picks, it is often done to give key lawmakers -- like Grassley and members of leadership -- a courtesy heads-up, or to consult with them and determine whether there would be major opposition. Cruz, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Friday on Twitter that a vote on Lynch shouldn't take place during the lame-duck session and should be put off until the new Congress convenes in January. ""Democratic senators who just lost their seats shouldn't confirm new Attorney General. Should be vetted by new Congress,"" he wrote. But another committee member, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CNN's Dana Bash that Lynch ""seems to be a solid choice"" and is qualified. Graham said he doesn't have any problems with her being confirmed in the lame-duck session, noting that other Cabinet picks have been approved during such periods.

"In a rare public appearance since admitting to an extramarital affair, David Petraeus apologized Tuesday night for the scandal that led to his resignation as head of the CIA last year. Petraeus, a retired four-star general, has stayed out of the limelight since the affair was revealed in November. ""Please allow me to begin my remarks this evening by reiterating how deeply I regret and apologize for the circumstances that led to my resignation from the CIA and caused such pain for my family, friends and supporters,"" Petraeus told a crowd gathered at a Los Angeles hotel ballroom.

It was one of the fist major public appearance since the scandal derailed the illustrious career of the decorated Army general. Petraeus, who once ran the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from his CIA post  in November. He admitted he had an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, a fellow West Point graduate who spent months studying the general's leadership of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The affair came to light during an FBI investigation of ""jealous"" e-mails Broadwell reportedly sent to another woman. At the speech Tuesday, he tried to move the focus from his past problems and shine a light on the accomplishments of military members. ""I join you keenly aware that I am regarded in a different light  now than I was a year ago,""  he said. ""But tonight is not about me. It is about your veterans.

"(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain announced Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate Friday, calling her ""the running mate who can best help me shake up Washington."" ""She's exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old Washington politics of me first and country second,"" the presumptive Republican nominee said at a Dayton, Ohio, rally of about 15,000 supporters, who welcomed the surprise pick of the relatively unknown politician with cheers and flags. ""She's got the grit, integrity, good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in Washington today,"" McCain said. Palin, 44,  described herself as a fighter against corruption and a bipartisan reformer in her first appearance as a candidate for vice president, an office she said she never expected to seek. ""I was just your average hockey mom in Alaska"" before getting involved in politics, she said. ""When I found corruption there, I fought it hard and brought the offenders to account."" Palin told the crowd, ""To have been chosen brings a great challenge. I know that it will demand the best that I have to give, and I promise nothing less.""  Watch Palin say she's honored to be picked » . Palin is a first-term governor who unseated incumbent Gov. Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary in 2006 and went on to defeat former Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat, in the general election. Campaigning for governor, she described herself as a ""conservative Republican, a firm believer in free-market capitalism"" and ""a lifelong Alaskan who grew up hunting and fishing."" She boasted of eliminating taxes as mayor in her hometown of Wasilla, Alaska. She also was a City Council member in the town and was chairwoman of Alaska's Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which regulates oil and gas resources. Palin will be the first woman to be nominated for vice president as a Republican and only the second to run for vice president on a major party ticket, after Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984. Palin also will be the first Alaskan to be on the ticket of either party. She described herself Friday as ""commander in chief of the Alaska National Guard"" and noted that her oldest son, Track, is a U.S. soldier scheduled to deploy soon to Iraq. But there also are aspects of her biography that make her unusual for a Republican candidate. McCain introduced her as a former union member and the wife of a union member, a nod to Ohio's strong organized-labor culture. iReport.com: What do you think of McCain's VP pick? Palin made her name in part by backing tough ethical standards for politicians. During the first legislative session after her election as governor, her administration passed a state ethics law overhaul. Nevertheless, she is under investigation for her firing of a state official, Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan. She has been instructed to hand over documents and recordings of telephone conversations as part of the inquiry, which grew out of allegations that she sacked Monegan for refusing to fire her former brother-in-law from the state police. She has denied wrongdoing. But Palin acknowledged that a member of her staff made a call to a trooper in which the staffer suggested that he was speaking for the governor. Palin has admitted that the call could be interpreted as pressure to fire state trooper Mike Wooten, who was locked in a child-custody battle with Palin's sister. She suspended the staffer who made the call. McCain apparently is making a concerted effort to reach out to former supporters of Sen. Hillary Clinton who may be unhappy with the choice of Sen. Barack Obama as the Democratic nominee.  Watch McCain praise Palin » . ""Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling in America. But it turns out the women of America aren't finished yet, and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all,"" Palin said in her speech. The remark brought a mixed reaction from the Republican crowd; some women cheered, but there was also some low-pitched groaning and booing. Democratic leaders, including the party's presidential nominee Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton, also issued mixed reactions to Palin's announcement. ""We should all be proud of Gov. Sarah Palin's historic nomination, and I congratulate her and Sen. McCain. While their policies would take America in the wrong direction, Gov. Palin will add an important new voice to the debate,"" Clinton said. ""Ultimately John McCain is at the top of the ticket. As I indicated in my speech last night, I think that he wants to take the country in the wrong direction. I'm assuming Gov. Palin agrees with him in in his policies,"" said Obama, who called Palin later in the day to congratulate her. ""But the fact that she's been nominated, I think, or will soon be nominated, I think is one more indicator of this country moving forward,"" said Obama. ""I congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate."" His campaign issued a more pointed response. ""Today, John McCain put the former mayor of a town of 9,000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency. Gov. Palin shares John McCain's commitment to overturning Roe v. Wade, the agenda of Big Oil and continuing George Bush's failed economic policies. That's not the change we need; it's just more of the same,"" Obama spokeswoman Adrianne March said. Rep. Thad McCotter, a Michigan Republican, said Palin has more executive experience than the entire Democratic ticket. Most of the speculation about McCain's choice had focused on former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut and 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas also had been mentioned as a possible long shot if McCain were to seek a woman. Palin is the youngest person elected governor of Alaska and the first woman to hold the job. iReport.com: McCain's pick called ""a stroke of genius"" She was dubbed ""Sarah Barracuda"" by opponents when she was mayor in Wasilla, resurrecting a nickname she earned as a state champion high school basketball player, according to the Almanac of American Politics. She is married to Todd Palin, an oil production operator on Alaska's North Slope. They have five children. Her youngest, Trig, was diagnosed in utero with Down syndrome. Palin has focused on energy policy during her short stint in office, and she is known for her support of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a position McCain opposes but many grassroots Republicans support.","Sen.

"Iranian centrist candidate Hassan Rouhani won the Islamic republic's presidential election Saturday after campaigning on a ""hope and prudence"" platform in which he appealed to traditional conservatives and reform-minded voters alike. Rouhani spoke of reforms without threatening Iran's supreme leader or its institutions, of which he is a product. The former national security council chief promised an environment with greater personal freedoms and even indicated he would free political prisoners and jailed journalists. In his campaigning, Rouhani also pledged to improve the economy and unemployment, and as a former nuclear negotiator, he said he would reduce the high tension between Iran and the outside world by addressing sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program. Young and old Iranians continued their celebration of his victory as Saturday became the early minutes of Sunday. They honked horns and flashed victory signs with their fingers. In a message through the semiofficial Fars News Agency, the 65-year-old Rouhani thanked God ""that once again the sun of rationality and moderation is shining over Iran again to send the voice of unity and cohesion of this nation to the world."" He cited ""all moderates, all reformists, and all principlists."" ""This victory is the victory of wisdom, moderation, growth and awareness, the victory of commitment and religiosity over extremism and ill tempers,"" Rouhani said. In a sign of how the West is interested in how much change Rouhani could bring to Iran, the British Foreign Office immediately called upon Rouhani to set a new course for the country. ""We call on him to use the opportunity to set Iran on a different course for the future: addressing international concerns about Iran's nuclear program, taking forward a constructive relationship with the international community, and improving the political and human rights situation for the people of Iran,"" a Foreign Office spokesman said. The administration of President Barack Obama hopes ""the Iranian government will heed the will of the Iranian people and make responsible choices that create a better future for all Iranians,"" a White House spokesman said. ""The United States remains ready to engage the Iranian government directly in order to reach a diplomatic solution that will fully address the international community's concerns about Iran's nuclear program,"" the press secretary's statement added. While the White House respected the vote, it charged that the election occurred ""against the backdrop of a lack of transparency, censorship of the media, Internet, and text messages, and an intimidating security environment that limited freedom of expression and assembly."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon offered his congratulations and called on Iran to take a ""constructive role in regional and international affairs."" In Syria, an opposition coalition in that country's two-year civil war said it hoped Rouhani would end Iran's support of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. ""With its continued support for Assad, Iran has used all political, military, and economic means to block Syrians from achieving democracy and freedom,"" the Syrian Coalition said in a statement from Istanbul, Turkey. ""The Syrian Coalition also hopes that Iran recognizes the Syrian people's plight for free elections, rights and freedoms and that it halts all support to the oppressive Assad regime,"" the group said. Opinion: Will Rouhani alter Iran's policy on Syria? High turnout reported . Iranian officials reported a high turnout, with nearly 73% of some 50 million registered voters -- men and women, young and old -- turning out, Interior Minister Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar announced Saturday. The lines extended into the streets at times Friday, as voters waited to pick their choice to succeed two-term President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the country's 11th presidential election. Rouhani takes Ahmadinejad's mantle as one of the country's most visible figures, at a time when it is dealing with painful economic sanctions tied to international concern about its nuclear program. But he won't be Iran's most powerful man. That distinction belongs to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been Iran's supreme leader since 1989. He's got plenty of backing, from conservative citizens to loyalist militia groups to, most notably, the Revolutionary Guard. Rouhani has all-round credentials in Iran's institutions that include senior cleric, former commander of Iranian air defenses and is an intellectual with three law degrees, including from a university in Scotland. He has a reputation for shunning extreme positions and bridging differences. While he has represented Khamenei on Iran's security council since 1989, he has avoided being perceived as a pushover and has taken exception with the supreme leader on being too rigid toward the international community, according to an Iranian scholar at Stanford University. Rouhani has accused state-run media of censorship and publishing lies. Ahmadinejad congratulated Rouhani. ""I have always deeply believed in the vast and endless capacities of the Iranian nation for development and greatness,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""I believe that all peaks of glory can be conquered by believing and trusting in the Iranian nation and by respecting different interests and tastes."" On the streets of Tehran, one celebrating group of two young men and two young women said that if Rouhani does what he promised, they would be ""very happy"" with him. The other candidates were two-term Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Saeed Jalili, Mohsen Rezaei, Ali-Akbar Velayati and Mohammad Gharazi. Velayati, Ghalibaf and Jalili, who is Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, are considered close to Khamenei and would have been unlikely to challenge his authority. Of the three, Jalili had enjoyed the most popular support going into the vote. Results showed that Rouhani secured 18.6 million votes -- or 50.7% of the 36,704,156 votes tallied. Second was Ghalibaf, with 6.1 million votes, and third was Jalili, with nearly 4.2 million votes. Moments after Rouhani was declared the winner, supporters started filling the area near Tehran's Haft-e-Tir Square, waving the campaign's purple flags, a witness told CNN. Motorists honked, and pedestrians held their fingers high with the V sign. Earlier, British Prime Minister David Cameron told CNN's Richard Quest that the international community ""will have to deal with whatever the situation is."" ""We have to remember this is always only an election between a restricted number of candidates, it's not democracy as we know it,"" he said. ""We have a very clear message to the Iranian government, which is that there is an option that gets Iran back into the international community, back into the family of nations. But it's got to be proper cooperation on this nuclear dossier, where so little progress frankly has been made. Otherwise, we will continue with the sanctions."" Powerful support . It was Iran's Guardian Council, an unelected body made up of six clerics and six lawyers operating under the oversight of the supreme leader, that drew up the restricted list of candidates from the 680 who initially registered. Eight candidates were approved, two of whom subsequently dropped out. The final six contenders didn't include any women. Nor did they include Ahmadinejad's aide and protege Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who was among those excluded by the Guardian Council. Rouhani had the backing of the highly influential former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and appears to have won over parts of Iran's subdued reform movement. The 65-year-old cleric's campaign began to gather steam last month, when he dared to accuse the state media of censorship and lies during a live interview on state TV, and then criticized the government's tight grip on security at a televised rally a few days later. Despite his growing popularity among opposition circles, Rouhani has long been a part of Iran's ruling establishment. The only cleric among the candidates, he has close ties to Khamenei and served in Iran's parliament for two decades. He was also Iran's lead nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005 and  holds seats on several powerful decision-making bodies. Hours into the voting Friday, Rouhani complained of a voting irregularity. A reform candidate, Mohammed Aref, who dropped out of the race earlier in the week, was still on some ballots. Rouhani was worried that voters might mistakenly select Aref, which would amount to a vote thrown away. It was not clear how many ballot papers were concerned. CNN's view on the streets of Tehran .

"Marie Colvin, a veteran correspondent who was killed in Syria last week, died trying to get her shoes so she could escape a shelling attack, her paper reported Sunday. Colvin, a New York native, worked for London's The Sunday Times. As is the custom in Syria, she took off her shoes upon entering a building that was serving as a makeshift press center. She was on the ground floor when rockets hit the upper floors, The Sunday Times reported. Thinking then that the building was a target, Colvin rushed to retrieve her shoes in the hall. A rocket landed just a few yards away, the paper said. Colvin, 56,  was the only British newspaper journalist inside the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr. She was killed alongside French journalist Remi Ochlik in the attack  Wednesday. Her mother, Rosemarie Colvin, said aid workers have been trying for days to remove her daughter's body from the war-ravaged country. She added that she believes her daughter was deliberately targeted by Syrian government forces. ""They were first in another house, and the top floors there were blown off,"" she said.  ""First (the Syrian forces) rocketed the front of the building,"" she said, fueling suspicion that the attack against a makeshift media center where Colvin and Ochlik were holed up was no accident. The Syrian government was not immediately available for comment. The day before she was killed, Colvin had given media interviews to networks like ITN and CNN about the ongoing clashes in Homs, and about a child who was killed in the city. ""The baby's death was just heartbreaking,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""We just watched this little boy, his little tummy, heaving and heaving as he tried to breathe. It was horrific. My heart broke."" Colvin reported Tuesday that there was ""constant shelling in the city"" and that the child's death was ""just one of many stories"" in violence-wracked Homs. ""It's chaos here."" Journalists and activists have been sneaking into Syria in an effort to report on the protests and clashes that have persistently challenged the authority of President Bashar al-Assad. Colvin said graphic images like that of the dying child, who was reportedly struck in the chest by a piece of shrapnel, needed to be shown. ""Something like that I think is actually stronger for an audience, for someone who's not here, for an audience for which the conflict, any conflict, is very far away. But that's the reality,"" she said. The siege of Baba Amr, where 28,000 civilians are ""hiding, being shelled, defenseless,"" Colvin reported, has become a flashpoint of the country's bloody year of violence. ""That baby probably will move more people to think, 'What is going on and why is no one stopping this murder in Homs that is happening everyday?'"" ""There are no military targets here,"" Colvin reported, refuting Syria claims that its forces are only hunting terrorists. ""It's a complete and utter lie,"" she said of the government's response. ""The Syrian Army is basically shelling a city of cold, starving civilians."" A day later, Colvin and Ochlik were killed. Colvin, a Yale graduate renowned for reporting on war's more human consequences, had for years worked in conflict zones and high risk areas, despite losing an eye in 2001 during a grenade attack in Sri Lanka. Since her death, her family has started a fund in her honor. ""We felt we had to do something so there was a place that people could donate,"" said family member Michael Colvin. The Marie Colvin fund is intended to direct resources to charities that her family says she would have supported.","Marie Colvin was attempting to escape a shelling attack, The Sunday Times reports .

"Retired Army Gen. David Petraeus resigned from his post as CIA director last week after an FBI investigation revealed he had an extramarital affair. The investigation also prompted questions about whether his paramour had inappropriate access to classified information. The scandal also has sparked an investigation into whether Marine Corps Gen. John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, sent inappropriate messages to a different woman, leading President Obama to put Allen's nomination to become NATO's supreme allied chief on hold. The FBI uncovered the Petraeus affair while it investigated e-mails that his paramour, Paula Broadwell, allegedly sent to a Petraeus family friend, Jill Kelley, according to a U.S. official. Kelley, meanwhile, is the woman to whom Allen allegedly sent inappropriate e-mails, according to the Defense Department. Below is a summary of what we know about the situation. Timeline of the Petraeus affair . New developments . -- A week after resigning as CIA director, Petraeus testified Friday in closed hearings to the House and Senate Intelligence committees about the September 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans dead. -- Petraeus said the Benghazi attack was an act of terrorism committed by al Qaeda-linked militants, said Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican. Petraeus ""stated that he thought all along he made it clear that there was significant terrorist involvement,"" according to King. The congressman said ""the clear impression"" he got from Petraeus in September testimony was that the attack ""arose out of a spontaneous demonstration."" -- According to King and other lawmakers, Petraeus testified that his resignation was not linked to the attack, a concern raised by administration detractors, given the timing of his departure just before the beginning of the hearings. -- Kelley visited the White House complex three times since September 28, a White House official said. The first two were for meals in the White House cafeteria with her sister and a White House staffer who met the Kelley family while visiting MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, and the third one -- on November 4 -- was a White House tour along with her husband and their three children, said the official. Petraeus: I did not pass on classified information . Opinion: 5 things we've learned from Petraeus scandal . The Petraeus affair . -- The FBI uncovered the affair between Petraeus, 60, and his biographer, Broadwell, 40, after Broadwell allegedly sent anonymous, harassing e-mails about Kelley -- first to Allen in May, and then to Kelley and her husband in June -- according to sources familiar with the case. -- Allen told Kelley about the e-mail he received, and Kelley eventually told an FBI agent -- a friend of hers -- about the messages, sources say. -- Kelley, 37, and her husband are friends of Petraeus and his family and friends of Allen. A Central Command spokesman said she is a volunteer with no official position at MacDill Air Force Base, where the U.S. Central Command is headquartered. -- The FBI determined that the messages came from Broadwell. One of the messages to Kelley was along the lines of ""stay away from my guy,"" a U.S. official says. -- During the investigation of the e-mails, other communications surfaced connecting Petraeus and Broadwell, who is a married mother of two living in North Carolina, an officer in the U.S. Army Reserve and a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of War Studies at King's College London. CIA vs. FBI in Petraeus scandal . -- Broadwell, a West Point graduate, had written a biography of Petraeus, published in January, called ""All In: The Education of General David Petraeus."" She met Petraeus in 2006 when he spoke at Harvard, where she was a graduate student. She wrote the book after researching Petraeus for her Ph.D. dissertation on his leadership skills and visiting him and his team in Afghanistan, where he became top U.S. commander in 2010. -- Petraeus and Broadwell began their affair in fall 2011, a few months after he returned to the United States, retired from the Army and took over at the CIA, according to a Petraeus friend. They ended it in the summer of 2012, Petraeus' friend said. -- On Election Day, November 6, Petraeus told Director of National Intelligence James Clapper about the affair, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official. Clapper advised Petraeus to resign, the official said. -- On November 9, Petraeus quit the CIA over the affair. The House and Senate intelligence committees were informed of the FBI investigation the same day. -- Petraeus' resignation came just days before he was scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee about the September 11 attack that killed four Americans at the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. Will national security scandal create national security risk? The Allen allegations . -- The Defense Department's inspector general is investigating allegations thatt Allen sent inappropriate messages to Kelley, the department said Tuesday. The FBI told the department about the allegations Sunday. -- Allen has denied wrongdoing, a senior defense official said. Sources familiar with Kelley have said the relationship between the two was not sexual. Authorities are looking at the e-mails. -- ""There is no affair"" between Allen and Kelley, a senior official close to Kelley said. ""She is a bored rich socialite involved with every single senior commander at CentCom, because she worked as an honorary ambassador."" -- A U.S. official familiar with the e-mails Allen sent to Kelley said, ""If they got out, John Allen would be very embarrassed by them."" The official added that there was no evidence of physical contact between the two. Investigations and fallout . -- The FBI is reviewing the actions of Frederick Humphries, the agent who triggered an investigation into e-mails received by Kelley,  a law enforcement official said Thursday. The agency will look at whether Humphries followed proper procedures in speaking to some members of Congress about his concerns about how the agency was handling Kelley's case. --  Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that he didn't tell the White House about the Petraeus investigation because it was determined there was no threat to national security. ""Had we made a determination that a threat to national security existed, we would of course had made that known to the president and to the appropriate members on the Hill,"" Holder told reporters. -- Broadwell, an Army Reserve officer, has had her government security clearance suspended pending the outcome of ongoing investigations, two U.S. officials with direct knowledge told CNN's Barbara Starr on Wednesday. -- Broadwell's affair with Petraeus has raised questions about whether it gave her access to national security information that she shouldn't have had. The allegedly harassing e-mails detailed the ""comings and goings of the generals and Ms. Kelley,"" according to a source. One of them was believed to be Petraeus, and because parts his schedule were not public, questions arose about whether the sender had access to sensitive information. -- In a speech at the University of Denver at the end of October, Broadwell suggested the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi took place because the United States was housing Libyan prisoners there -- a theory, she noted, that had not been vetted yet. The claim has since been discounted by administration officials. Broadwell's source for that previously unpublished information remains unclear, and there's no evidence that it came from Petraeus. -- Investigators have found classified information on a computer belonging to Broadwell, a law enforcement source told CNN national security contributor Fran Townsend on Wednesday. -- A senior law enforcement official close to the Broadwell investigation said Wednesday night that materials taken from Broadwell's home were under review, and that it appeared unlikely she would be prosecuted for any unauthorized release of classified information. -- On Tuesday, John Nagl, a retired military officer who worked for Petraeus for years and whom the former CIA director authorized to talk, said that Petraeus insists he never shared classified information with Broadwell. -- Obama said Wednesday that he had seen no evidence of a potentially damaging breach in national security stemming from the affair involving Petraeus. No sex required for unfaithfulness to begin . -- Obama also said Wednesday that Petraeus served his country with ""great distinction,"" and he hoped that Petraeus' affair and resignation are ""a single side note on what has otherwise been an extraordinary career."" -- Kelley's access to Florida's MacDill Air Force Base without an escort has been suspended, a Defense Department official said Wednesday. Kelley had been given special access to the base because of her position as a booster and promoter of programs to help U.S. troops, the official said. -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she would investigate why the FBI did not notify congressional oversight committees about its investigation into Petraeus after the bureau determined he was having a secret extramarital affair. -- Petraeus has not been following the media firestorm over the extramarital affair that led to his resignation. ""He wants to maintain a distance and focus on his family at this time,"" his aide, retired Col. Peter Mansoor, said Wednesday. -- While the nature of the relationship between Allen and Kelley, if any, is unclear, evidence of an affair could subject the general to military prosecution. Adultery is a violation of military law. -- Obama has put Allen's nomination to become NATO's supreme allied commander on hold pending the outcome of the investigation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday. --  A U.S. official told CNN that the CIA has launched an investigation into the ""general conduct"" of Petraeus that will look into whether he used agency resources in carrying out his affair with Broadwell.","David Petraeus testifies the Benghazi attack was terrorism, a lawmaker says .

"A Detroit-area man who claimed he accidentally shot and killed a 19-year-old woman he thought was breaking into his home was charged Friday with second-degree murder, after days of pressure from her relatives seeking an arrest. Theodore Paul Wafer, 54, also was charged with manslaughter and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony in the November 2 shooting of Renisha McBride, who authorities say was intoxicated and possibly disoriented following a car crash before Wafer shot her on his Dearborn Heights porch. McBride was unarmed and there was no evidence of a break-in, so Wafer -- who authorities say shot McBride from behind a closed, locked screen door -- cannot lawfully claim he needed to shoot her to stop an imminent threat, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy told reporters Friday. ""I am saying we do not believe he acted in lawful self-defense,"" Worthy said. Gerald Thurswell, an attorney for McBride's family, hailed the charges, saying he believes the evidence points to murder, but that a jury could go for manslaughter if it disagrees. Either way, he said, Wafer was in the wrong. ""She was intoxicated. She may have been boisterous. She may have been loud. ... (But) this man had absolutely no justification to take a shotgun and blow her head off,"" Thurswell said Friday, not addressing Wafer's explanation to police that the gun discharged accidentally. McBride's father, Walter Simmons, told reporters Friday he was thankful for the charges against ""this monster that killed my daughter."" Her mother, Monica McBride, dismissed notions that the shooting was accidental. ""You did no accident. You took a life, and you took a beautiful life that was starting to blossom into a beautiful woman,"" Monica McBride told reporters, addressing Wafer, who was in custody elsewhere. Wafer was arraigned on the charges Friday afternoon, and he was being held on bail set at $250,000. Report: Blood alcohol level of slain Detroit woman more than twice the legal limit . The crash and the shooting . The charges were the latest chapter in a case that received national media attention when McBride's family complained Wafer, who is white, wasn't immediately arrested and charged in the black woman's death. They contended she might have been seeking help when she approached his home. Authorities said McBride, of Detroit, drove into a parked car in the city around 1 a.m. After her death, tests determined her blood-alcohol level was 0.218% -- nearly three times the 0.08% legal limit for drivers in Michigan, the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office said. Witnesses said she left on foot, bloodied and disoriented, Worthy said. McBride ended up on Wafer's porch in neighboring Dearborn Heights at least a couple hours later that morning. Wafer told investigators he thought McBride was breaking into his home, and that the shotgun accidentally discharged when he investigated, police said. After 911 was called at 4:42 a.m., the unarmed McBride was found dead with large shotgun wound to her face, Worthy said. Investigators believe Wafer, standing in his home, opened the main door and shot the gun through a closed and locked screen door, Worthy said. Michigan law says a person has no duty to retreat in his or her own home, but to shoot someone and claim legal self-defense, the resident must reasonably believe he or she faces an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm, and must show that the use of force was needed to prevent this, Worthy said. There was no evidence of forced entry, and this case doesn't amount to self-defense, she said. One of Wafer's attorneys, Cheryl Carpenter, was not immediately available for comment Friday afternoon, her office said. Another attorney representing Wafer, Carpenter's father, Mack Carpenter, said this week that the death was a ""tragic accident"" and that his client was ""completely justified in everything he did."" Worthy said her office didn't feel McBride's intoxication was relevant in the decision to file charges. She added she didn't believe a toxicology test was done for Wafer. The second-degree murder charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The manslaughter charge, which alleges the weapon was aimed with intent but without malice, carries a penalty of up to 15 years in prison. A conviction on the felony firearm charge would mean a mandatory two-year prison term to be served before any other sentence. The next court hearing is scheduled for December 18. Wafer, an employee of the Wayne County Airport Authority, has been placed on administrative leave, authority spokesman Michael Conway told CNN. Woman's father: No reason for death . At a rally outside Wafer's house Wednesday night, McBride's relatives and friends alleged that the white homeowner had racially profiled the woman. On Friday afternoon, when asked if he thought race played a role in his daughter's death, Simmons demurred. ""I believe that this man took my daughter's life for no reason at all, from just one human being to another,"" Simmons said. ""And we just want justice done."" Thurswell, the attorney for McBride's parents, told reporters Friday that Wafer was safe in his home, and he should have called 911 before shooting if he believed his life was in jeopardy, not after. Thurswell said the family didn't know where McBride was in the hours before the crash or where she was going. McBride's parents said she was a 2012 high school graduate who planned to take online classes and entertained thoughts of being a nurse or working in the automotive industry. ""She could have been anything, but she's cut short of that now,"" Simmons said.

"(CNN)Few European Union politicians will have raised a New Year glass in expectation of a brighter future. Many fear that 2015 could be the year in which both the euro and the European Union itself begin to unravel. Once again the troubles will begin early in Greece, a country carelessly admitted to the euro before its finances were properly in shape, and which has twice had to be bailed out and bullied into efforts to get its economy onto a sound footing. Once again the Greek economy is at the heart of a euro crisis. The failure of the Greek government led by Antonis Samaras to win a majority vote for its favored presidential candidate means that Greece faces a snap general election on January 25, news that saw the Greek stock market fall 5% in one day. Polls suggest that the likely winner in the Greek general election will be Alexis Tsipras and his left-wing populist party, Syriza. The problem with that for the EU is that with more than a quarter of the Greek population unemployed, despite some signs of recovery in the economy, Syriza is winning wide support for its pledge to dump most of the pledges attached to its bailouts by the rest of Europe. Tsipras wants to end the austerity program imposed largely at Germany's insistence, reverse cuts in the minimum wage and repudiate much of Greece's debts. Although Tsipras has toned down his previous rhetoric and says he wants Greece to remain in the euro, it is hard to see how it could if he wins and holds to his election promises. Greece's departure would be the first major blow for the euro, and the wider EU. But Greece is not alone in having euroskeptic parties riding high in the opinion polls. Both Spain and Portugal have elections scheduled in 2015. In Spain, Podemos, a party strongly opposed to austerity programs designed to keep the country within euro rules is currently heading the polls. Portugal, facing the consequences of a 78 billion euro bailout ($97 billion) is racked by uncertainty following the arrest of government officials and leading politicians in both major parties over financial scandals. While ""eurocrats"" in Brussels hope that the likely turmoil in Greece will lead voters in Spain and Portugal to play for safety, it could have the opposite effect, emboldening voters to swing behind populist parties without coherent financial programs. In Italy too, three of the four biggest parties -- Forza Italia, the Northern League and comedian Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement -- are making increasingly euroskeptic noises. The biggest threat to Europe's future, though, comes from the general election in the United Kingdom, a country which has stayed outside the euro. Political scientists acknowledge that the UK election, due in May, is the hardest to call in living memory. The euroskeptic United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) has proven both by victory in the 2014 European Parliament elections and by success in recent by-elections for the Westminster Parliament, that it can take votes from both major parties, the Conservatives and the Labour Party. Participation in the coalition government has badly damaged the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives' partners, and in the aftermath of the referendum on independence for Scotland, the Scottish National Party is polling at a level that suggests it could wrest at least 20 Westminster seats from Labour, which has always depended on a hefty contingent of MPs in Scottish seats to win national elections. Neither major party looks capable of winning a UK election in its own right, but who the partners would be in any coalition formed to govern after May is totally uncertain. Already the administration likely to be formed then is being dubbed ""The Government of Losers."" Should the Conservatives led by David Cameron again emerge as the largest single party and form part of another coalition government, he would have to implement his pledge to stage an ""In or Out"" referendum on continued UK membership of the EU, after he has sought to renegotiate the terms of that membership with other leaders in Brussels. The danger for the EU is that in countering the appeal of UKIP, Cameron has been led into ever more vigorous vows to curb the numbers coming in, or to deny them welfare benefits if they do. If Europe fails to agree a compromise on the principle of free movement across borders within the EU then the expectations Cameron has aroused will be disappointed and many Conservatives will be likely to join UKIP supporters in voting against Britain's continued membership of the EU if the referendum is staged in 2017. That possibility poses a dilemma for other European leaders like Angela Merkel, who has long insisted that the principle of free movement is sacrosanct. On January 1, 2015, EU leaders were able to celebrate one measure of progress: Lithuania became the last of the three Baltic states which entered the Union in 2004 to ditch its old currency, the litas, and to become a fully-fledged member of the euro club. It may be the last thing those EU leaders have to celebrate for quite some while.

"Britain's government lifted its ban on a controversial mining process known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, Thursday, allowing companies to continue their exploration of shale gas reserves. Energy Secretary Edward Davey said the decision was subject to new controls to limit the risks of seismic activity. A halt was called to fracking last year after two small earthquakes in Lancashire, northwestern England, where Cuadrilla Resources was exploring for shale gas. The process involves pumping millions of gallons of water and chemicals into shale formations deep beneath the Earth's surface, causing the fracturing of the rock and the release of natural gas. It has proved controversial in the United States, where supporters say it provides cheap energy but critics are concerned about the potential for chemicals to seep into the drinking water supply. The new controls imposed by the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change include a requirement to carry out a seismic survey before work starts. Firms involved must also draw up a plan showing how the seismic risks will be limited, and monitor seismic activity before, during and after the exploration. Cuadrilla Resources said Thursday's decision to allow fracking to resume marked a significant step for Britain's future onshore gas industry. ""Today's news is a turning point for the country's energy future. Shale gas has the potential to create jobs, generate tax revenues, reduce our reliance on imported gas, and improve our balance of payments,"" chief executive Francis Egan said in a statement. In an interview with CNN, Egan insisted that fracking could be done ""safely and sensibly"" in Britain and that there are huge reserves to be exploited. The company believes there is about 200 trillion cubic feet of gas under the ground just within its license area in Lancashire. To put that figure into context, the United Kingdom uses about 3 trillion cubic feet of gas a year, Egan said. He said he could understand that people are concerned but pointed out that the two tremors triggered in April and May of last year ""were not major events."" The website of the British Geological Survey shows it has recorded nine tremors of a similar magnitude in the past two months, he said. ""They are not life-threatening events or damage-inducing events, but they do cause concern, so as a consequence the fracking was suspended,"" he said. Cuadrilla has done a lot of work since then, he said, including carrying out 3-D mapping of the area. Extensive arrays will be installed around the wells to monitor seismic activity, he added. As for concerns about how the liquids used in fracking will affect water supplies, Egan said the company uses only one friction-reducing chemical, in small quantities. He said it is not hazardous and the government oversees its use. The strong regulatory environment in the United Kingdom ""will stand us in good stead,"" Egan said, although he acknowledged it would mean the pace of exploration may be slower than in the United States. The process has sparked opposition in the United Kingdom. The government announcement marks ""the start of a major battle over what sort of world we will leave to our children,"" said Lilly Morse, an activist with the Frack Off campaign group. ""The government and industry's promises of cheap, abundant gas are deluded,"" she said, adding that in the United States, ""the gas bubble has already burst"" and some fracking companies are on the verge of bankruptcy. ""The government's strategy of relying on fracking to fuel a new wave of gas-fired power stations is utterly insane. Fracking is dirty, destructive and extremely expensive, and could never deliver the quantities of gas envisaged.""","Fracking can be done ""safely and sensibly,"" the chief executive of Cuadrilla says .

"The Justice Department and JPMorgan Chase are wrestling with whether some of the $13 billion tentative settlement covering JPMorgan's mortgage practices should come out of the government's pocket, a source familiar with the talks told CNN. Lawyers for the two sides are continuing talks on some final sticking points in the settlement covering the bank's mortgage securities practices. The outline of the deal was struck last Friday. The biggest point of contention remaining is whether some of the settlement money covering mortgage securities sold by Washington Mutual, which was acquired by JPMorgan, could end up coming from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the government-backed insurer of banking deposits, the source says. When JPMorgan bought failing Washington Mutual from the government in 2008, the FDIC was stuck with some of its liabilities. The Justice Department insists on language in the settlement that would prohibit JPMorgan from making claims against the FDIC for some of the money it is going to have to pay. On Friday, JPMorgan and the agency that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac concluded their portion of the broader settlement. The bank agreed to pay $5.1 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to cover alleged deceptive practices in sales of mortgage securities, including by Washington Mutual, to the government-backed housing finance giants. The FHFA agreement doesn't include a prohibition on JPMorgan recovering money from the FDIC. Justice Department lawyers want it included in their final deal. JPMorgan declined comment.","Justice Department and JPMorgan reached tentative, $13 billion settlement last week .

"A Pakistani doctor accused of helping the CIA track down Osama bin Laden was sentenced Wednesday to 33 years in prison for treason, officials told CNN. Shakeel Afridi was also fined $3,500 for spying for the United States, said Nasir Khan, a Khyber Agency official, and Fazal Mehmood, an official from the tribal court that handed down the sentence. The court heard the case against Afridi for two months. The doctor was not afforded a chance to defend himself, which is in accordance with the laws of the tribal justice system, the two officials said. Pakistan fires doctor who helped CIA hunt bin Laden . Afridi was present at the sentencing and was sent to the central jail in nearby Peshawar. Afridi helped the CIA use a vaccination campaign in an attempt to collect DNA samples from residents of bin Laden's compound in the city of Abbottabad to verify the al Qaeda leader's presence there. Bin Laden was killed in the subsequent U.S. raid on the compound in May of last year. Ret. Navy seal speaks on how bin Laden kill mission unfolded . At least one legal analyst said Afridi's sentence was a sham. Islamabad-based lawyer Shahzad Akbar said the punishment was handed down by a tribal court in Khyber even though the alleged offense occurred in Abbottabad, which raises questions about the legitimacy of the proceedings. Tweeting Osama's death: The accidental citizen journalist . ""This judgment won't last,"" Akbar told CNN. ""If this punishment is challenged by Dr. Afridi's family in the Superior Court of Pakistan, there is a good possibility that the sentence will be turned around."" Human rights groups have often accused tribal courts of violating the fair trial process guaranteed under Pakistan's constitution. Akbar said the Afridi ruling could be a move by the government to save face without making a spectacle out of a sensitive situation. In a federal court, the government would have had to produce evidence, and Afridi would have the right to defend himself. ""There is ample case law that says this process is cheating against the laws and constitution of Pakistan,"" Akbar said. Afridi can appeal the sentence, said Tariq Hayat Khan, a senior official in the tribal region. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton intervened on behalf of Afridi when he was first arrested, a senior U.S. official told CNN. Clinton argued that Afridi should be released and ""will keep doing so,"" the official said. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has acknowledged Afridi's role in bin Laden's discovery, saying he was extremely helpful in the operation against the al Qaeda leader. Bin Laden letters released -- a terrorist losing control . A statement from U.S. Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Carl Levin, D-Michigan, who both sit on the Armed Services Committee, also said that Afridi's actions were far from treason and that the sentence was ""shocking and outrageous."" ""Dr. Afridi set an example that we wish others in Pakistan had followed long ago,"" the lawmakers said, ""He should be praised and rewarded for his actions, not punished and slandered."" Afridi was charged under the Frontier Crimes Regulation, British-era laws that govern Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal region and do not carry the death penalty. In October, a Pakistani commission recommended treason charges be filed against Afridi. A federal investigation is ongoing, according to a government official close to the investigation who is not authorized to speak to the media. The official was not clear on how Wednesday's sentencing would affect the federal case.","U.S. senators reject treason claim, call sentence ""shocking and outrageous""

"The 19-year-old son of U.S. Sen. Rand Paul was charged with underage drinking and disorderly conduct after being arrested over the weekend at North Carolina's Charlotte Douglas International Airport, authorities said. William Hilton Paul was arrested Saturday after a flight from Kentucky to North Carolina, according to the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office in Charlotte. Authorities did not say whether Paul, of Bowling Green, Kentucky, was believed to have been drinking on the airplane or at the airport. A spokesman for U.S. Airways said Paul was not served onboard. ""Our reports indicate that (Paul) slept through the drink service and was not served onboard,"" Andrew Christie said. The senator's office released a statement calling the issue a private family matter. ""Sen. Paul is a national public figure and subject to scrutiny in the public arena, however, as many parents with teenagers would understand, his family should be afforded the privacy and respect they deserve in a situation such as this,"" according to the statement released late Sunday by Moira Bagley, Paul's communications director. The younger Paul was charged with three misdemeanor offenses: disorderly conduct at an airport, being intoxicated and disruptive and consuming beer and wine underage. He is due in court on February 25, the Mecklenburg County court clerk's office said. He has maintained a fairly low profile, appearing at a handful of campaign events alongside his father. The first-term senator was elected in 2010 with strong tea party support, and in recent months he has publicly said he is interested in running for president in 2016.

"As the drumbeat to roll back the Common Core State Standards gets louder, some people are starting to question the value and purpose of academic standards in the first place. Do states really need to set expectations for what all students should learn? Are state standardized tests necessary? Why not return to an age when Americans simply trusted their children's teachers to craft curricula and appraise student progress? Good questions, but perhaps more wishful than informed. Teachers should indeed be in charge of classroom instruction, but quality standards are an important piece of a comprehensive effort to boost student achievement. That effort also depends on quality assessments, clear information for parents and teachers to find out whether students have mastered the knowledge and skills they need, and some way to hold schools accountable for meeting the needs of the students they serve. The move by states to set academic standards -- which broadly define what students should know and be able to do in subjects like reading and math -- arose from the conviction that all children, regardless of race or socioeconomic status, should have an equal opportunity to learn what they need for college and beyond. Before state standards, schools, districts, and teachers held different students to different expectations. Affluent youngsters, especially if they were also white, were much likelier to get rigorous curricula, advanced courses, college-prep ""tracks"" and ""gifted and talented"" classes. Poor and minority students were apt to be placed into low-level courses and into vocational tracks. More than that, reliable studies show that even the hardest-working teachers with the best of intentions can unconsciously hold students to lower expectations, depending on where those students come from. For instance, one study published in 2012 by Rutgers psychology professor Kent D. Harber reported what happened when his team gave a poorly written essay to 113 white middle-school and high-school teachers. The teachers were told that the essay was written by a black student, a white student, or a Latino student, and that their feedback would be given directly to the student to help him or her improve. The result? The teachers provided more praise and less criticism if they thought the student who wrote the essay was black or Hispanic. To combat these gaps in expectations, states began to develop expectations for student learning, broad guidelines meant to spell out what students should know and be able to do in core subjects at different grade levels. Today, ample evidence shows this strategy succeeds, so long as rigorous standards are accompanied by tests that measure student learning and accountability for results. When this happens, students do better. In 2005, for instance, research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that state achievement growth as measured by the National Assessment of Educational Progress shows that ""accountability systems ... had a clear positive impact on student achievement."" Even more significant, the gains that schools have seen in the standards-and-accountability era have been stronger for disadvantaged youngsters. According to education analyst John Chubb, ""student achievement has grown much more rapidly in the last decade ... than during the 1990s, especially for the lowest achieving and most-disadvantaged students in the nation."" Since 2000, ""the bottom 10% (of students) had gained far more than the national average ... in math and reading, more than a full grade level in math."" Because standards -- and the tests and accompany them --  do affect what is taught and learned, the quality and rigor of those standards matters enormously. And that is where the Common Core standards are a game-changer. In math, they focus on the content that matters most and give teachers and their students the time and space they need for deep mastery of the knowledge and skills most needed for college and beyond. In literacy, the Common Core emphasizes three things that are essential to improving reading comprehension. These are: . Reading and analyzing rigorous texts that are worth reading by placing ""equal emphasis on the sophistication of what students read and the skill with which they read."" The critical link between content and comprehension. Once students learn how to decode, reading comprehension is directly linked not just to their fluency with reading skills, but also with their knowledge and vocabulary. The Common Core underscores this connection and calls for curricula that build knowledge over time. The importance of ""close reading."" In a world that discourages us from giving careful attention to much of anything, the Common Core stresses reading closely and carefully, focusing on the author's words, and using important, rich texts to build knowledge and deepen comprehension. These are essential not just for college readiness, but for full participation in any society's civic culture. Standards alone don't do this. Their promise is kept only if the tests are sound and the classroom implementation is meticulous. What's needed to make real progress is to seize opportunities when they emerge. Common Core represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to dramatically increase the rigor of standards, upgrade the tests and accountability systems, and make make necessary mid-course corrections to curricula, instruction, and standards implementation. Now is the time to move past politics and give teachers the space they need to make the promise of these expectations a reality for our children.","Kathleen Porter-Magee: People ask about value of academic standards like Common Core .

"In a few weeks, the New York State Education Department will begin the second round of Common Core tests. Earlier this spring, thousands of students refused to take the Common Core English Language Arts (ELA) exams. In New York, as in states across the country, parents are telling administrators that their children will not sit for exams that pressure teachers to teach to the test and drain school budgets. Ignore the baseless charge that families don't want high academic standards for their kids or are afraid their kids won't live up to higher standards. Parents and students want schools that offer a well-rounded curriculum and a sensible amount and way of testing. But the Common Core seems to focus too much on testing. According to the 2014 New York Testing Program School Administrator's Manual, parents may eventually review students' responses to open-ended questions, but they are not allowed to look at the test itself. Although educators are under a gag order from New York State and Pearson that prohibits them from discussing specifics of the tests, Principal Elizabeth Phillips of PS 321 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and other educators across the state have decried the ELA exams as confusing and developmentally inappropriate. The situation may be the same in mathematics. Stanford professor James Milgram argues that the Common Core math standards do not command international respect and will not prepare students for STEM careers. If the state keeps hiding the exams from public scrutiny, then parents and educators have a right to doubt their pedagogical value. There are other issues. The Race to the Top program awarded New York $700 million on the condition that the state adopts a value added modeling teacher evaluation system, in this case, APPR. Put plainly -- the state may now fire teachers if test scores are low. That creates incredible pressure to teach to the test. Additionally, English language learners must also take the tests, regardless of how well they can understand them, and teachers in impoverished school districts are more likely to be punished, despite taking on harder assignments. In the words of noted education scholar Diane Ravitch: VAM is a sham. I recently attended an iRefuse rally held on Long Island. The poster for the event juxtaposes two silhouettes of a child's head: one, under the title ""Learning,"" is filled with images of Shakespeare, a guitar, a flower, math equations and plants. The other, under the title ""Testing,"" is filled with a multiple-choice exam. That is why parents are refusing -- they want school to be a place where children's talents are cultivated and not harmed by tests whose main use is to fire teachers. In 1849, the American philosopher Henry David Thoreau wrote a classic essay on civil disobedience that has inspired countless activists around the world, including Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. According to Thoreau, ""It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right."" According to Thoreau, people are too inclined to respect the government rather than question whether the people who lead it are acting justly. Today, a parent inspired by Thoreau would point out that the New York Education Department is led by fallible human beings such as John King, Ken Slentz and Ken Wagner, and the tests are created by Pearson, a corporation that has been found to use its nonprofit foundation to produce curriculum materials and software for its for-profit business. Such a parent would also object to the School Administrators Manual's policy that ""schools do not have any obligation to provide an alternative location or activities for individual students while the tests are being administered."" This sentence justifies the sit-and-stare policy whereby refusing children are not allowed to read or talk, but are forced to remain at their desks while their peers take the tests. In other words, this manual encourages administrators to employ the ""silent treatment"" on kids who don't want their education to become endless test prep. This is bullying pure and simple. As a parent, what would you do if you wanted to refuse the upcoming math test for your child? Write a letter or e-mail to the board of education, superintendent, principals and teachers in your school district to formally notify them of your decision to refuse to allow your child to participate in any local assessments tied to APPR for the 2013-2014 school year. Tell them that you want your child to be scored as a ""refusal"" with a final score of ""999"" and a standard achieved code of 96, on all state testing. This ensures that schools and teachers are not impacted by the refusals. There is a chance that administrators will try to dissuade you. Tell them that you are advocating for your children to receive a well-rounded, personalized education. Tell everyone in your district that you are not fighting him or her, but rather political and corporate forces that are trying to centralize and standardize public education.","In New York, as in other states, some parents oppose the Common Core exams .

Hill, 31, was an adventurer with a goal of setting a world record by visiting every country on Earth in 1,200 days, but he interrupted his journey this spring to participate in the ABC reality competition. He was gliding off a steep hill in Draper, Utah, Sunday when his parachute partially collapsed and ""swung him into the hillside like a pendulum,"" Salt Lake County Unified Fire spokesman Brian Anderton told CNN. Although he was not far above the ground when he fell and he was wearing a helmet, Hill ""hit with quite a bit of velocity,"" causing severe injuries, Anderton said. Hill was flown to University of Utah Medical Center, where he later died, according to Anderton and Facebook postings by Hill's sister Karen Tracy. ""Bachelorette"" producers sent a statement to CNN saying they are ""deeply saddened to hear about the tragic passing of our friend, Eric Hill."" ""Eric inspired us every day with his passion, his courage and his adventurous spirit, and for that we are very thankful,"" the show's statement said. ""On behalf of our cast, crew and producers, we send our love, our thoughts and our prayers to Eric's family during this difficult time."" The 10th season of the show premieres on May 19. Hill's Facebook page and website proclaimed that he would visit ""every country in world record time"" while ""sharing the awesome that exists in every country, especially with the people!"" His ""Global Odyssey"" page said: ""But this is not your ordinary travel blog, for you see, YOU will decide what he does (and what he eats) in virtually every country. From skydiving over Australia, to eating scorpions on the Great Wall of China, we'll be posting items for you to vote on ... and he promises to do as you command!""

"(CNN)  -- A New Zealand teenager has been questioned in connection with a scheme by hackers to remotely take over more than 1 million computers worldwide and use them for criminal activity, New Zealand police and the FBI said Thursday. FBI Director Robert Mueller says botnets are ""the weapon of choice for cyber criminals."" The FBI has identified at least 2.5 million unsuspecting computer users who have been victims of so-called ""botnet"" activity. Hackers install viruses, worms and other attack programs that allow them to take over the computers and use them to commit cyber crimes. Industry numbers suggest there are as many as 5 million infected computers. The FBI tracked down the teen and believes the 18-year-old, known by the cyber alias ""AKILL,"" was the ringleader of an international botnet group know as the ""A-team,"" responsible for infecting more than 1 million computers. Authorities seized computer equipment and questioned the teen, said New Zealand Police Detective Inspector Peter Devoy, but the person has not been identified, arrested or charged.  Watch how botnet attacks occur » . Internet addresses and information furnished by the FBI led to the teenager, Devoy told CNN. ""Today, botnets are the weapon of choice for cyber criminals,"" said FBI Director Robert Mueller in a statement. ""They seek to conceal their criminal activities by using third-party computers as vehicles for their crimes."" Personal computers can be compromised when users open an attachment, click on an advertisement or give personal information to a ""phishing"" site, or a fake site that looks legitimate. The FBI advises users to protect themselves by updating their anti-virus software, installing a firewall, using non-common passwords and avoiding suspicious e-mail attachments and advertisers' links. In 2005 the FBI launched Operation Bot Roast to combat botnet attacks, which the bureau estimates have caused $20 million in losses and theft, including one scheme that bilked a Midwest financial institution out of millions. Since June, eight people have been charged or convicted of crimes related to botnet activity. Between January and June, Symantec Corp., a leading computer security company, detected more than 5 million bot-infested personal computers carrying out at least one attack a day, according to the company's September report. That was a 17 percent decrease form the previous reporting period, according to Symantec, which said hackers appeared to be abandoning the technique because of strengthened security and law enforcement initiatives. China had the most infected computers at 29 percent, followed by the United States at 13 percent, Symantec reported. However, 43 percent of the servers used by hackers to operate the hijacked computers were located in the United States, Symantec said.  E-mail to a friend .

"A diverse group of young emerging leaders from all across Africa and the diaspora has come together to promote a unified vision for the continent and devise ways to move it forward. Dubbed Africa 2.0, the advocacy group recently met in Mombasa, Kenya, to bring together some 250 young businessmen, social entrepreneurs and opinion leaders from nearly 40 African countries to work toward a strategy that could help the continent leapfrog and accelerate its development. ""If you think about it, China has an agenda for Africa. India has an agenda, Europe, America. It's about time we Africans set an agenda for ourselves."" says Mamadou Toure, founder of Africa 2.0. The move comes as Africa undergoes a period of economic transformation, becoming increasingly attractive to international investors -- last year, the continent's economy grew by nearly 5% while six of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world are currently from Africa. Survey: Africa attractive to investors -- but the world still needs convincing . World Bank economist Vera Songwe says the initiative is bringing together young Africans who want their continent to achieve growth and are interested in spreading the message that ""Africa is a different place to do business."" The group has set the target of achieving a prosperous and inspiring Africa within the next 20 years. It has marked 2020 as a key milestone and works on a manifesto to raise awareness of what needs to be done until then. Toure calls Africa 2.0 a social contract between the private sector, civil society and governments. He says the strategy for the group's vision is based on four axis: uplifting Africans, creating and sharing the wealth, upgrading the infrastructure and setting up a growth-enabling environment. The group's agenda includes pushing for the proposed Africa free trade area, a bloc that would span 26 countries, as well as a plan for better governance and boosting entrepreneurship. ""Ultimately, Vision Africa 2020 is the legacy of a generation on how they see the future of this continent and how they believe we can take it to the next level,"" says Toure. ""We view ourselves also as a voice from the people who will ultimately inherit this continent."" Toure, who is also an investment and development officer at the International Finance Corporation, says that one of the main challenges today is the willingness and acceptance of current decision makers to make a space for the youth. He adds that changing the mindset is crucial for the future prospects of the continent. ""It's about building an African 'can-do' attitude that would get Africans to take ownership of their own future and to start rolling their sleeves to actually face the challenge ahead,"" he says. Toure says Africa 2.0, which will hold its next symposium in Nigeria next year, is not just another initiative that's hung up on endless discussions. Instead, he calls it a 'Dink Dank'-- a terminology coined to describe a think tank that does things -- which aims to get their ideas endorsed by government leaders and put plans in place to execute them. ""We are action-driven,"" he says. ""We are committing to implement it and we invite whoever believes in that to step in -- it is the responsibility of all and the society we are entering now in this 21st century and it is a society where everyone can be a leader,"" he adds. While there's still much to be improved before the group's goals are implemented, some say that change is on the way. ""We've now just seen good elections in a couple of countries. We saw in a couple of countries they've changed regulations. Many more are doing better on the Better Business Index, which means institutions are strengthening because in the end, that is what governance means,"" notes Songwe. ""Governance means building strong institutions that are sustainable and survive long after leaders that created them have left. I think in that case we are doing well,"" she adds.","Africa 2.0 is an advocacy group that works toward a vision that could help the continent leapfrog .

"The shock of seeing the forlorn hulk of the Costa Concordia hasn't been dimmed by time. I'm here once again on the pristine little Italian island of Giglio, made famous not for its beauty, but for the tragedy on its shores. The Concordia is illuminated by salvage vessels in the inky dark March night. Plans are well advanced to move the vessel, but for now it remains stranded, a macabre beacon at the entrance to the island's main port. More than a year on from the catastrophe the capsized cruise liner is only now giving up its darkest secrets, with a prosecutor's report now throwing light on how some of the 32 victims died. The most heart-rending story is that of 5-year-old Dayana Arlotti and her father William, who were both unable to find space on a lifeboat. The pair struggled to the other side of the tilting ship, but fell into a flooded chasm and drowned. Dayana was the youngest victim -- it beggars belief that adults in the lifeboat refused to give up their seats for a girl who'd only just started school. And then there's the horror endured by bartender Erika Molina. She managed to get onto a lifeboat, but fell out amid the chaotic launch. Without a life jacket she was sucked underwater by swirling currents as the cruise liner capsized. Maria D'Introno is the only victim whose body has yet to be found. She too was unable to get on the packed lifeboats; so much for women and children first. She was last seen trembling on the edge of the ship. Eventually she jumped into the icy water below. She didn't have a life jacket and couldn't swim. Just a few hundred meters from shore, she also drowned as horrified islanders looked on. Giuseppe Girolamo was a musician aboard, lucky enough initially to get into a lifeboat, gracious enough to give up his seat to someone else. He too drowned in those dark panicked hours that followed. Capt. Francesco Schettino has been under investigation for manslaughter and abandoning ship, but prosecutors now recommend he should stand trial, together with four other crew members and a shore-based manager. One of the accused crew is Manrico Giampedroni. He'd previously been declared a hero, the last person winched off the ship, but he's now accused of failing in his duties to help with the evacuation. The tragedy is still discussed earnestly as if it happened yesterday, according to one American part-time resident of the island. This tiny maritime community has become inured to the savage power of the sea; the walls of local hotels are covered with fading black and white photos of wrecked schooners and cargo ships. But what shocked locals is that this happened on a calm January night, to a modern cruise liner bristling with the latest navigation equipment. Despite all the advances in ship design and technology, 100 years after the Titanic, once again passengers were left without enough lifeboats. Since the disaster, the island's small winter population of a few hundred has been swelled by dozens of salvage experts. The operation to right the Concordia is the biggest maritime salvage exercise ever undertaken with 111 divers working in shifts 24 hours a day from a floating accommodation support vessel tethered next to the wreck. They are helping to deposit 18,000 tons of concrete beneath the hull to stabilize it before it is carefully rolled upright in the summer. Huge ""sponson"" flotation tanks are being prepared that will act like children's water wings to give the ship buoyancy and massive metal frames anchored to the granite seabed will become vital crutches to support the hull. The sponsons will then be pressurized with air and the Costa Concordia should then float, enabling experts to tow it to the mainland to be cut up for scrap metal; something that couldn't have been done on the water, for fear it would lead to devastating pollution of this national park. But even if this ambitious salvage is successful, it still will have taken almost two years to remove the wreck. Although there is no permanent memorial to the tragedy on Giglio, many islanders are reminded about the disaster every time they look out of their window and see the wreck. But even when the ship is gone in September or October, the memories of Friday 13th in January 2012 will remain vivid here -- the night disaster made Giglio notorious.","A year ago Sunday, a luxury cruise liner capsized off the Italian coast claiming 32 lives .

"In a major milestone for gay rights, the U.S. government on Monday expanded recognition of same-sex marriages in federal legal matters, including bankruptcies, prison visits and survivor benefits. ""It is the (Justice Department's) policy to recognize lawful same-sex marriages as broadly as possible, to ensure equal treatment for all members of society regardless of sexual orientation,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a memo to all employees. The federal expansion includes 34 states where same-sex marriage isn't legal, but the new federal benefits being extended to those states will apply only where the U.S. government has jurisdiction. For example, a same-sex couple legally married in Massachusetts can now have a federal bankruptcy proceeding recognized in Alabama, even though it doesn't allow same-sex marriages. In the past, the U.S. government could challenge the couple's joint bankruptcy because Alabama doesn't recognize same-sex marriage. Human Rights Campaign, which advocates equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people,  called it a ""landmark announcement"" that it ""will change the lives of countless committed gay and lesbian couples for the better."" But Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, criticized what he called the latest move by the Obama administration ""to undermine the authority and sovereignty of the states to make their own determinations regulating the institution of marriage."" The move impacts how millions of Americans interact with the federal government, including bankruptcy cases, prison visitation rights, survivor benefits for police officers and firefighters killed on the job, and the legal right to refuse to testify to incriminate a spouse.","Feds recognize same-sex marriage for legal purposes even in 34 states that don't allow it .

"In an unprecedented report, a United Nations committee slammed the Vatican's handling of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church and accused the church of protecting itself rather than the victims. The Vatican should establish an ""independent mechanism for monitoring children's rights"" to investigate complaints and work with law enforcement, according to the report, which was released Wednesday. It calls for the church to immediately remove all known or suspected abusers from its ranks. The permanent observer of the Holy See to the United Nations, Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, said the Catholic Church has done much for the protection of children, but should do more. ""We have to continue to refine, to enact provisions that protect children in all their necessities so that they may grow and become productive adults in society and their dignity be constantly respected,"" he told Vatican Radio. The report follows a hearing last month where Vatican officials were grilled over the church's handling of child abuse allegations. The Vatican, as a country, is a signatory of the U.N. Convention of the Rights of the Child, and it was the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child that published the report. Clerics have been involved in the sexual abuse of ""tens of thousands"" of children, the report says, and the United Nations is concerned about how the Vatican has handled the allegations. ""The committee is gravely concerned that the Holy See has not acknowledged the extent of the crimes committed, has not taken the necessary measures to address cases of child sexual abuse and protect children, and has adopted policies and practices which has led to the continuation of the abuse by and the impunity of the perpetrators,"" the report states. The Vatican on Wednesday said it will study the report. Tomasi said the church does more than ""other institutions or even other states"" to prevent further child abuse. He criticized the U.N. report for saying the church should accept the practice of abortion. ""This is a contradiction with the principle of life that the convention itself should support, recommending that children be protected before and after birth,"" he said. The report accuses the Vatican of transferring child sexual abusers from one parish to another in an attempt to cover up crimes, placing children at high risk for abuse. ""The Holy See has consistently placed the preservation of the reputation of the Church and the protection of the perpetrators above children's best interests,"" the report states. Closed-door proceedings have allowed a majority of abusers to avoid criminal proceedings, the report says. A ""code of silence"" within the clergy ensures that many cases of child sexual abuse are not reported to law enforcement, according to the report. Last month, the  Vatican acknowledged that close to 400 priests left the priesthood in 2011 and 2012 because of accusations that they had sexually abused children. Since taking the helm of the Roman Catholic Church in March, Pope Francis has told a senior Vatican official to carry out ""due proceedings against the guilty"" in sexual abuse cases. The report also called on the Vatican to make it mandatory to report all cases of suspected child abuse to law enforcement. The report rejected a Vatican argument that it, the Holy See, is only responsible for people who live in the tiny Vatican city-state. The U.N. says the Vatican has supreme power over individuals and institutions under its authority. One advocacy group, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said the report is evidence that Vatican claims of reform are deceptive. It is ""utterly tragic"" that a body like the U.N. must tell the church to kick out abusers, the group said. ""That is, of course, common sense and common decency,"" SNAP said in a statement. ""That the church hierarchy must be told this is damning."" U.N. committee on sexual abuse grills Vatican officials .

"Hong Kong (CNN)A year ago, China relaxed its controversial one-child policy, allowing couples to have a second baby if the mother or father was an only child themselves. It was hailed as a major liberalization of the three-decades old restriction, but new figures suggest that fewer people than expected are taking the plunge and expanding their family. Nationwide, nearly one million couples eligible under the new rules have applied to have a second child, state media reported on Monday. It's estimated that 11 million couples are eligible for additional children, and health officials had said that the policy would lead to as many as two million new births when the policy change was first announced. In the capital Beijing, around 30,000 couples have submitted applications for a second child, fewer than the 50,000 expected, state news agency Xinhua reported. The situation in other cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen is similar, it added. Many parents feel like Beijing resident Eason, a father of a three-year-old who fears the financial burden another baby would bring. He declined to give his full name. ""Raising our only child is already taking up a very significant part of our expenditure,"" he said. ""Having another baby would cost more for their education, housing, and such."" ""Taking care of only one child is very energy-consuming for the two of us and our parents."" Others, like Zhang Li, are going ahead with plans to get pregnant but face opposition from family members. ""My parents are strongly against us having a second baby. They think it will bring much more financial obligations. Plus, no one will have the time and energy to take care of the newborn,"" she told CNN. Attitudes like these worry demographers, who warn that China faces the prospect of growing old before it gets wealthy enough to look after its elderly. Many think China should scrap its birth control policy entirely to ensure the country has enough workers to support an aging population. There have been reports that this might happen as soon as 2016. ""Long term demographics are a concern. China is sometimes compared with Japan, where economic problems have in part stemmed from demographic trends,"" said Brian Jackson, a Beijing-based economist at research group IHS Global Insight. Perhaps China's leaders are hoping that parents are simply putting their baby-making plans on hold until fortunes are a little more assured. The upcoming Lunar New Year, which begins in February, marks the Year of the Sheep in the Chinese Zodiac; ""sheep babies"" are traditionally believed to be meek and encounter bad luck. CNN intern Sherry Fei Ju in Beijing contributed to this report .","Wary of changing demographics, Chinese authorities recently relaxed the country's controversial one-child policy .

"The long-awaited peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians resumed Wednesday evening in Jerusalem, a senior Palestinian official told CNN --  three years after the last direct negotiations stalled over the issue of settlements in disputed territory. As a gesture of goodwill, Israel began releasing more than two dozen Palestinian prisoners late Tuesday on the eve of new peace talks that have been complicated by Israeli plans for new housing in East Jerusalem. Some of the Palestinians had been held for more than 20 years. But as the vans rolled away, a group of demonstrators waved signs condemning the release, complaining that the prisoners had Israeli blood on their hands. The prisoner release came after Israel said it would forge ahead with a plan to build 900 housing units in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians hope will be the capital of their future state. Opinion: Why Netanyahu's dark world view clouds peace prospects . The issue of Israeli settlements derailed the last round of direct talks in 2010, and critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say building on disputed territory could derail the new talks. ""Netanyahu has to decide which government he is heading: a government that is trying to reach a peace agreement, or a government that is trying to undermine all possibilities of this agreement,"" said Shelly Yachimovich, head of the Labor Party and the Israeli opposition. In January, the United Nations Human Rights Council said Israeli settlements amount to ""creeping annexation"" of Palestinian territories by Israel and have taken a ""heavy toll"" on the rights and sovereignty of Palestinians. And in Washington, where American leaders have pushed both sides to return to the table, the State Department said it had ""serious concerns"" with the new announcement. ""We've encouraged both sides broadly speaking to refrain from taking steps that could undermine trust. We said that from the beginning,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. ""We've also been clear that these are complicated issues, and there will be bumps in the road."" Daoud Kuttab, a columnist for the online Middle Eastern news site Al-Monitor, said the released prisoners are a bargaining chip to make sure the Palestinians don't back out of the talks despite their anger over new settlements. Opinion: Five ways to tell is peace talks are serious . ""They're trapped, and Mahmoud Abbas has egg on his face today because he can't get out of the talks,"" Kuttab told CNN. Both sides agreed to resume talks for nine months under American mediation,  said Rami Khoury, a veteran Middle East analyst at the American University of Beirut. ""This is a significant gesture, so therefore you're going to hear a lot of noise from both sides -- complaints, grievances,"" Khoury said. ""But you can pretty much discount most of what you hear in public, because they're both clearly committed to doing this for nine months. And we really need to give it time to see what's going to happen."" Abbas and Netanyahu are ""hemmed in by domestic constraints,"" leaving neither side likely to make significant changes on its own, Khoury said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said last week that ""many difficult choices"" lie ahead for both sides, but held out hope that ""reasonable compromises"" could be reached. Khoury called that a ""weak statement"" that downplayed expectations for the talks. As a result, most observers have little hope that the talks will produce a breakthrough in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But he said the U.S. role in the talks is a ""wild card"" that could defy those expectations. ""What is the United States going to do?"" he asked. ""Will it push both sides? Will it pressure them? Will it cajole them? Will it entice them, and will it make serious bridging and endgame proposals? We have no idea about any of that.""","Talks resumed Wednesday evening, senior Palestinian official says .

"The Justice Department will no longer pursue mandatory minimum sentences for certain low-level, nonviolent drug offenders, Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday, noting the nation is ""coldly efficient in jailing criminals,"" but that it ""cannot prosecute or incarcerate"" its way to becoming safer. ""Too many Americans go to too many prisons for far too long, and for no truly good law enforcement reason,"" Holder told the American Bar Association's House of Delegates in San Francisco. He questioned some assumptions about the criminal justice system's approach to the ""war on drugs,"" saying that excessive incarceration has been an ""ineffective and unsustainable"" part of it. Although he said the United States should not abandon being tough on crime, Holder embraced steps to address ""shameful"" racial disparities in sentencing, the budgetary strains of overpopulated prisons and policies for incarceration that punish and rehabilitate, ""not merely to warehouse and forget."" Holder invoked President Barack Obama, saying the two had been talking about the issues and agreed to try to ""strike a balance"" that clears the way for a ""pragmatic"" and ""commonsense"" solutions to enhance public safety and the ""public good."" The centerpiece of Holder's plan is to scale back prosecution for certain drug offenders -- those with no ties to large-scale organizations, gangs or cartels. He said they would no longer be charged with offenses that ""impose draconian mandatory minimum sentences."" They now ""will be charged with offenses for which the accompanying sentences are better suited to their individual conduct, rather than excessive prison terms more appropriate for violent criminals or drug kingpins."" The changes are effective immediately. Lessening the use of mandatory minimums -- sentences that require a ""one-size-fits-all"" punishment for those convicted of federal and state crimes -- could mark the end of the tough-on-crime era that began with strict anti-drug laws in the 1970s and accelerated with mandatory minimum prison sentences and so-called three-strikes laws. Opinion: Shame of mandatory minimums shows in Marissa Alexander case . The attorney general linked the effort to rethink mandatory minimum sentencing for drug crimes to key issues. Racial disparities . Holder said ""unwarranted disparities are far too common"" in the criminal justice system, reminding his audience that Obama alluded to some of the issues in remarks he made after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin last month, giving voice to African-American concerns that ""there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws -- everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws."" Holder said the nation ""must confront the reality"" that once ""people of color"" are in the criminal justice system, they ""often face harsher punishments than their peers."" He called it ""unacceptable,"" ""shameful"" and ""unworthy"" of the U.S. legal tradition. Prison overcrowding . Holder said the U.S. prison population has grown by almost 800% since 1980, and federal prisons are operating at nearly 40% above capacity. ""Even though this country comprises just 5% of the world's population, we incarcerate almost a quarter of the world's prisoners. More than 219,000 federal inmates are currently behind bars,"" he said, noting that almost half are serving time for drug-related crimes and have substance abuse problems. Moreover, he said 9 million to 10 million more people cycle through America's local jails each year. And roughly 40% of former federal prisoners -- and more than 60% of former state prisoners -- are rearrested or have their supervision revoked within three years after their release. It was not immediately clear Monday whether Holder's announcement would have any impact on people already in prison. Economic, social burden . Holder said overcrowding at the federal, state and local levels is ""both ineffective and unsustainable."" He said it imposes a significant economic burden -- totaling $80 billion in 2010 alone -- and it comes with ""human and moral costs that are impossible to calculate."" Legislation to lessen the use of mandatory minimums, Holder said, would ultimately save the United States billions. Holder going after Texas voting law . Although Obama administration officials say the changes they are pursuing will not require congressional approval, some unlikely pairs of lawmakers have united to push for criminal justice changes. Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky have worked together to allow judges to depart from mandatory minimum sentences when circumstances merit. Democratic Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois and Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah have undertaken similar efforts. Holder blasts 'stand your ground' In recent years, there has been a rise in support among conservatives for reforms to the criminal justice system. While more flexible approaches to crimes have long held support among liberal Democrats, the fear of being tarred as weak on crime by Republican opponents has long caused moderate Democrats, particularly those running for president, to avoid the issue. In addition to changes to mandatory minimums, Holder called for expanding the use of ""compassionate release"" from jail for those who ""pose no threat to the public."" He also said the Justice Department is taking steps to identify practices for enhancing the use of drug treatment and community service programs as alternatives to jail. Holder also said he has asked federal prosecutors to develop new guidelines for determining when federal charges should be filed and when they should not. ""I've also issued guidance to ensure that every case we bring serves a substantial federal interest and complements the work of our law enforcement partners,"" he said. Holder additionally directed prosecutors to create comprehensive anti-violence strategies for badly afflicted areas. Holder not afraid to take on race debate . The American Civil Liberties Union praised Holder's approach Monday, calling it an important step toward ending federal prison overcrowding and creating a ""fairer criminal justice system."" Laura Murphy, director of the ACLU's Washington legislative office, said in a news release, however, that although Holder's announcement ""is an important first step,"" Congress also must act to change laws that ""lock up hundreds of thousands of Americans unfairly and unnecessarily."" Michael Mukasey, a former judge and an attorney general under President George W. Bush, said he is not a fan of mandatory minimums, but he does not support what Holder is doing. ""I generally agree with the goal of getting rid of mandatory minimums,"" said Mukasey. ""But the way to do that is to pass a law,"" he said in an interview on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper.""","Holder announces action for ""certain low-level, nonviolent drug offenders""

"At 16, Deon just about stopped dreaming. The teen, born and raised mainly in Yakima, Washington, has been in and out of foster care since he was 5. Every time it looked like he might finally be adopted and find a permanent home, his hopes were dashed. ""You start to feel numb and depressed,"" said Deon, admitting that last year he ""kind of gave up"" ever thinking a family would want him. ""You lose hope ... and you think ... I have a few more years to go of this. What's going to happen to me?"" he said during an interview. At 18, children in foster care essentially age out of the system. State agencies might offer them services such as job skills training or help building resumes, but they ultimately need to find a way to take care of themselves. ""It's pretty frightening for them because they really are just pretty much on their own,"" said Amber Louis, Recruitment and Outreach Specialist for the Northwest Adoption Exchange in Seattle. An idea is born . While Deon was giving up, Jennifer Loomis, an acclaimed maternity and family photographer, was getting curious. A friend of hers had adopted a child. Since she and her boyfriend of four years didn't have any kids, she thought they should consider adopting as well. So, she went online, visiting sites that showcased children to adopt. ""I was so blown away by how bad the photos were that I thought, 'Oh my God, these photos don't show these kids at all,' "" said Loomis. ""I can't get a sense of who these kids are."" As someone who tries to give back to her community as much as possible, Loomis thought surely she could carve out a couple of days to do a free photo shoot to create better pictures for the children. ""And so I sent an e-mail that night ... I said, 'Hi, this is really random but I'm a photographer in Seattle and I was looking through your site and I really feel like you guys need better photos,' "" she told me with a laugh, remembering the directness of her note. Amber Louis of the Northwest Adoption Exchange received Loomis' e-mail and jumped at the opportunity. ""I see so many kids with photos that just don't do them justice,"" said Louis. ""I think any photo that we can put together that shows their personality a little bit more is really helpful. ... I think it also increases the likelihood that an adoptive parent is going to stop and take a look when they are just scrolling through the pages of photos."" Strike a pose . Loomis teamed up with another photographer, Rocky Salskov, and received donations from friends and clients, including food, balloons, even a small trampoline, to use for the photo shoot. The goal? To show the ""sensitive, vulnerable side of these kids,"" said Loomis. ""I wanted photos where you could look into their eyes and see into their soul a little bit better, where you could be like, 'Wow, Deon, what a guy,' "" she said. Deon was one of seven children in foster care, from age 9 through 17, chosen for the two-day photo shoot. ""I got really into it. I started posing, and there was one part where they had the trampoline there and that was so fun. You jump up in the air and strike a pose,"" he said. ""It was really, really cool."" Louis said she had targeted kids like Deon who she thought needed new photos. ""You just cross your fingers and hope that ... a photo will catch (someone's) eye and they'll inquire."" 'A burning thing in my heart' Joanna Church of Oak Harbor, Washington, which is on Whidbey Island, remembers being at a church service as a young girl, and hearing about how children are less likely to be adopted as they get older and how older children in foster care are at greater risk for homelessness and incarceration once they age out of the foster care system. They are also at greater risk of unemployment, pregnancy and suffering from poor health, according to research. ""And so from a really young age ... it just was a burning thing in my heart that I just knew it was something I wanted to do someday,"" said Church, who works with the Canadian National Defense and helps military families living on Whidbey Island. After trying for some time to have biological children, Church approached her husband, Sean Vaillancourt, a sonar operator for the Canadian Navy, with the idea of adopting an older child in the foster care system. Vaillancourt remembers feeling unsure about whether they should take such a life-changing step. ""I was nervous going into it because you just don't know what you're about to get ... like, 'Am I going to be borrowing trouble? Am I going to be a good father?' "" said Vaillancourt. After thinking about how much they had in their lives and how much they could give back, he decided to go forward but remained anxious. Sparkly, happy eyes . With her husband's support, Church headed online to look for children hoping for a home. She saw Deon's picture on a different website and went right past it, she said. 'It wasn't a good picture. It was grainy. ... It did not capture me at all."" But when she saw Deon on the Northwest Adoption Exchange website, which showcased the pictures that Loomis and Salskov had taken, she stopped. ""You saw ... personality in the face, like you saw it coming off the page, and it was enough to get us to stop and open that profile and look at it, and want to get to know Deon better,"" said Church. When I asked her what she saw in those pictures, she said Deon's ""sparkly happy eyes."" OPINION: Why adoption jokes hurt . Amber Louis remembers the phone call. ""When I heard that there was this family interested, I kept my fingers and toes crossed,"" she said. Photographer Loomis, who is due to give birth in July, smiled when she heard the news. ""This is exactly what I hoped for even though I wasn't sure it would happen. Photographs can be really powerful when they are authentic and genuine."" When Deon learned a family was interested in him, he was excited but his guard remained up. ""I thought it was too good to be true because I've had that happen to me where I'd go for a little bit and then I'd come back, and so the fact that somebody actually wants me is pretty cool."" In October, Deon moved into Joanna and Sean's home and then they started the process of adopting him. They expect his adoption to become final next week and are planning a big family party to celebrate. Joanna and Sean are also helping Deon get Canadian citizenship, because they will be moving to Victoria, British Columbia in August. No matter where they live, they say they are committed to making sure Deon remains connected with his biological family, including a great grandmother who has been his primary care provider throughout this life. ""They've really given me a new look on life,"" said Deon, referring to Joanna and Sean. ""Instead of feeling just like that I'm all alone, I actually feel like I have somebody there for me."" ""I think that's the most rewarding thing is just trying to be there for somebody else,"" said Vaillancourt. Raising awareness . Church has become a passionate advocate for children in foster care, hoping her story will help raise awareness about how many kids are waiting for homes and how life-changing adoption can be for them. As of November of last year, there were nearly 400,000 children in the United States in foster care. ""There's just such a need, there (are) just so many great kids out there,"" she said. To people who might be afraid to adopt an older child thinking they will come with grown-up issues to contend with, Church argues that biological children come with big question marks, too. ""Well, you just don't know what kind of kid you're going to get,"" she said people tell her. ""And my response is always, you (don't) know what kind of kid you're going to get when you birth them."" Saving a life . For Church's husband, the experience is all about giving a kid a chance. ""We've all had our chances, from our parents, from somebody looking out for us, and these (kids) have nobody looking out for them,"" said Vaillancourt. Before the couple decided to adopt Deon, he didn't do that well in school and thought the military might be his only option. Now his grades are up, and he's running track for his high school, learning to drive, getting excited to travel to Canada and thinking about other careers, including one in the military. ""We get the privilege of helping a kid discover who he is, what he likes, what his strengths are and what he can be truly passionate about in life,"" said Church in a follow-up e-mail. When you give someone a chance, it can change their life forever, Deon said. ""They could actually play a part in the community and do something with (themselves), rather than end up in jail or even worse, dead,"" he said. ""You are basically saving a life.""

"And I thought Miley Cyrus' performance at the VMAs generated a ton of opinions. Ask parents how they feel about homework, as we did on CNN's Facebook page, and the response is immediate and intense. So many parents from all over the country sounded off passionately, saying we expect too much, too little or the wrong things from young students. As children go back to school and parents negotiate balancing family time and take-home assignments, parents shared that their children are stressed out and exhausted by the volume of homework they receive (so, too, are parents who say they've had to become drill sergeants in their own home to get it all done). Other parents said their kids aren't getting enough or any homework at all and they've had to create their own to keep their kids challenged. Some parents complained that their kids' homework is more busy work than helpful work to improve academic performance, while others said their kids' homework is just right -- and critical to competing in a global economy. Lisa Morguess, a mom of seven in Fullerton, California, who is against any homework in elementary school, started a blog called Hometown Homework Chronicles. It chronicles her dealings with her children's school and school district to limit the amount of homework. ""I feel that, especially in elementary school, spending six to seven hours a day in school is enough,"" said Morguess in an interview via e-mail. ""Kids are tired after that and need to unwind and engage in nonacademic activities -- many of which are just as valuable in creating a well-rounded person as academics are."" That said, Morguess concedes it's next to impossible to get her children's school or any school to begin a no-homework policy. ""The concept of homework is so ingrained in our culture that people can't and won't think about what it might be like if we just stopped making our kids do homework,"" said Morguess. ""So I've put my foot down and refused to enforce more than 10 minutes of homework per grade level for each of my elementary school kids, which is the guideline recommended by both the National PTA and the National Education Association."" (Her kids' teachers this year so far seem accepting of her policy.) Homework: How much, how often? On the other side of the debate is Ann Gunty, a mom of four in Flagstaff, Arizona, who doesn't understand -- or support -- the notion that children should have less homework or no homework at all. ""I just don't think it's the right thing to say, 'Oh, they don't need any homework. It's just too much. They should be out playing. They should only go to school,' "" Gunty told me.  ""Making it less and less and less is contributing to us being less competitive worldwide."" Gunty's kids, who attend a school that runs from grade 5 through 12, get between one to two hours of homework, including 30 math problems every night, which she feels is appropriate, beneficial (her kids' school enjoys high test scores and strong college placement) and not intrusive on their ability to still be kids or enjoy family time. Mozart Saint Cyr, a father or two in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, takes it bit further: He doesn't think kids today get enough homework and are so distracted by video games and social media that they're going downhill. He says parents should demand more from their kids: ""If the school provided extra homework, some parents would force their kids to do (it)."" How to help your kids with homework . For many parents, the beef about homework is not whether it's too much or too little but the type of work the kids are bringing home. ""I am not an advocate for homework for the sake of homework,"" said Francesca Price, a pregnant mom of two sons who aren't yet school-age. ""This does nothing but waste time for the student who has yet to complete it, as well as for the teacher who has to grade it, giving both of them what everyone calls 'busy work.' "" Dr. Tish Howard, a newly retired elementary school principal who continues to work with ailing schools as CEO of Edu-Linx Consulting, has never been a proponent of what she calls ""tedious homework."" ""If a child is struggling, homework is not the key to improvement,"" she said, noting how few children have parents at home to help them if they're having trouble with their homework. ""Our schools need to embed intervention time at the end of each day to support the learning of that day and ensure conceptual understanding before new learning is added the next day."" Rachel Dueker, now a college sophomore in Ottawa, Kansas, says she benefited from a high school seminar class at the end of the day where she could do her homework in school -- a tremendous stress reliever. ""I always did my math homework during my seminar class and went to my math teacher and sat side by side with her and got that help, and I didn't have to put in any extra time. It was given to me,"" Dueker said during an interview. Music may harm your studying, study says . Rhonda Lochiatto, a 16-year teaching veteran who currently teaches fourth grade in Volusia County, Florida, came up with a unique homework policy after she realized as a parent herself how little time there is for homework once you factor in after-school activities and life in general. ""I don't require homework. In my class, I see homework as my opportunity to provide guidance to parents and offer ways for them to help their children at home,"" said the mom of two, who gives her students a ""suggestion calendar"" with optional interactive activities such as read-aloud time and topics to discuss. ""If a child has mastered a skill, there is no reason to waste time drilling it over and over, especially when they are struggling in other areas,"" said Lochiatto. Opinion: U.S. lag in math, science a disaster in the making . One thing I heard repeatedly from parents on both sides of the debate is the impact homework has -- or does not have -- on academic performance. Allie Eleuther, a single mom of two in Hilton Head, South Carolina, said it has been proven there is little value in homework. ""More is not always better and does not result in kids getting a better education and doing better on standardized tests."" Shay Hardin, a single mother of two, believes the movement away from homework is hurting our children's performance and the United States overall. ""This is why many countries are already beginning to exceed the U.S. in terms of educational rank,"" she said. Who's right? If only it were a black and white issue, but it's not. A 2012 study found no relationship between the amount of time spent on homework and grades, but did find a positive link between homework and performance on standardized tests. A 2006 analysis of homework studies found a link between time spent on homework and achievement, but found it was much stronger in secondary school versus elementary school. That analysis also found that for junior high school students, homework reaches the point of diminishing return at around 90 minutes, and between 90 minutes and 2.5 hours for high schoolers. ""We just need to figure out what the right dosage is,"" said Erik Entrikin, a father of three whose girls sometimes get up earlier than their normal 5:30 a.m. wake-up time just to finish their homework. ""Currently, it is much too high."" Follow Kelly Wallace on Twitter and like CNN Living on Facebook.","There is a sharp debate among parents about homework .

"The special court set up in Cambodia to try people accused of atrocities under the Khmer Rouge has ordered the release of the regime's ""first lady,"" saying she's unfit to stand trial. Ieng Thirith, who served as minister for social affairs in the Khmer Rouge regime during the 1970s, had been accused of crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, genocide, homicide, torture and religious persecution. However, proceedings against her were halted in November last year after the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia decided she could not face trial as she suffered from dementia. After seeking further medical assessment, the court issued a statement Thursday confirming the earlier diagnosis that Ieng Thirith suffers from a ""progressive, degenerative illness (likely Alzheimer's disease) and remains unfit to stand trial."" Judge resigns from court trying Khmer Rouge crimes . It added that medical experts confirmed that ""all treatment options have now been exhausted and that the accused's cognitive impairment is likely irreversible."" As a result, the court recognized she would be incapable of remembering or complying with any conditions -- but reminded her not to interfere in their investigations in any way and to remain in Cambodia. Khmer Rouge torture prison chief gets life sentence . Ieng Thirith, 80, was one of four surviving leaders of the brutal regime facing prosecution -- the others being her husband Ieng Sary, the former Khmer Rouge foreign minister; Khieu Samphon, the nominal head of state; and Nuon Chea, the prime minister, also known as Brother Number 2. They remain on trial. The head of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, was known as Brother Number 1. He died in 1998, long before the U.N.-backed court came into existence. He had previously been married to Ieng Thirith's sister, Khieu Ponnary. Under Pol Pot's leadership, the Khmer Rouge regime was responsible for the deaths of millions of ordinary Cambodians during a four-year reign of terror that was eventually halted in 1979 by invading Vietnamese forces. In 1975, the Khmer Rouge ordered people out of Phnom Penh, the capital, and other cities in Cambodia to work in the countryside. It is said to be responsible for about 1.7 million deaths, roughly a quarter of the population at the time. Its stated aim was to create a Communist utopia, but instead the regime forced Cambodians into what has been described as a living hell.","U.N. court in Cambodia upheld earlier diagnosis that Ieng Thirith has dementia .

"Prominent Saudi lawyer and reform advocate Waleed Abulkhair was sentenced on Sunday to 15 years in prison and a 15-year travel ban to be applied after his release from jail for, among other things, ""inciting public opinion against the government"" and ""insulting the country's leaders and judiciary,"" according to human rights activists in Saudi Arabia. He was also ordered to pay the sum of 200,000 Saudi riyals ($53,000).  And, according to official Saudi news agency SPA, he is required to close any websites affiliated with the organization he heads, the Monitor of Human Rights Saudi Arabia. The government said the group was run illegally as an unlicensed organization that attempted to prejudice the public against the government. ""This is the price Abulkhair was expecting as a result of his defense of human rights and standing with the oppressed,"" the group said in a statement. Abulkhair has called for government reforms including the creation of a constitutional monarchy, the release of political prisoners and the expansion of women's rights. His wife, Samar Badawi, told CNN her husband does not accept the verdict, nor will he appeal it, as he doesn't recognize the legitimacy of the court or its ruling.  Badawi, who was present when the sentence was read, added, ""This verdict was far from just. Waleed was tried and sentenced simply for his work as a human rights activist."" Human Rights Watch, which has been closely monitoring the trial, condemned the verdict shortly after it was issued. ""Waleed Abu al-Khair's harsh sentence shows that Saudi Arabia has no tolerance for those who speak out about human rights and political reform and it will go to any length to silence them,"" said HRW Saudi researcher Adam Coogle. It's the second time in less than a year that Abulkhair, one of Saudi Arabia's leading and most outspoken liberal voices, has been found guilty by a Saudi court. In October, he was sentenced to three months in prison for signing statements critical of the Saudi government and of Saudi officials. Just as that case was winding down in a court in Jeddah, another one against Abulkhair was gearing up in Riyadh -- this one at the Specialized Criminal Court, a venue known for trying accused terrorists. Charged with ""speaking to the foreign media with the intention of harming the country's reputation"" and ""breaking allegiance with the King,"" Abulkhair refused on many occasions to recognize the legitimacy of the court. In April, while attending the fifth hearing of his trial, Abulkhair was arrested. He's been incarcerated ever since. Despite repeated attempts, CNN was unable to reach Saudi Arabia's Justice Ministry or Interior Ministry for comment. Human rights organizations say Abulkhair's conviction is simply the latest in a long line of disturbing instances where activists have been deliberately targeted and prosecuted in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy with little tolerance for dissent. ""As Saudi Arabia sits as a member on the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva,"" said Coogle, ""its courts back home are locking away peaceful activists on harsh sentences merely for calling for reform and respect for human rights."" In May, Raif Badawi was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes by a Saudi court for insulting Islam. Badawi, Abulkhair's client and brother-in-law, first got into legal trouble with the Saudi government after starting a liberal website and forum where users could discuss religion. April saw activist Fadhil al-Manasif receive a 15-year sentence and 15-year travel ban for ""breaking allegiance with the King"" and ""harming the reputation of Saudi Arabia by speaking with foreign news agencies."" In 2013, two of the country's most vocal reform advocates, Mohammed al-Qahtani and Abdullah al-Hamid, were each sentenced to 10 years in prison and a five-year travel ban. Both were found guilty of providing inaccurate information to foreign media and founding and operating an unlicensed human rights organization, as well as other offenses. Human rights organizations may be outraged by these outcomes, but they're hardly surprised. Earlier this year, the Saudi government passed a series of very strong and sweeping anti-terror laws that many groups feared would be used as a way to quash dissent. In a statement, Human Rights Watch said: ""Saudi Arabia's new terrorism law and a series of related royal decrees create a legal framework that appears to criminalize virtually all dissident thought or expression as terrorism. The sweeping provisions in the measures, all issued since January 2014, threaten to close down altogether Saudi Arabia's already extremely restricted space for free expression."" In 2013, Abulkhair spoke to CNN via Skype from Saudi Arabia, as he was under a travel ban. He said any activist who calls for reform there is in danger of being arrested. ""Here's the thing,"" Abualkhair explained. ""The government of Saudi Arabia, they want to show themselves outside Saudi Arabia that they are modern, that they are open-minded, that they want to change, they want to reform, that the problem is coming from the society, and that the society moves slowly. They keep saying that for the foreign media. But actually inside, when we act with our society, when we want to reform, when we want to do something with our society, they keep punishing us.""

"(CNN) -- The revelation from Steven Kazmierczak's girlfriend that he had stopped taking an antidepressant a few weeks before his rampage at Northern Illinois University has reopened debate about whether the drug can cause violent behavior. Jessica Baty told CNN that she had seen no hint during their two-year courtship that the 27-year-old might be capable of killing five people and injuring 17 before committing suicide. Kazmierczak had stopped taking Prozac three weeks before his shooting spree on February 14 and had been taking two other medications, she said. Experts differ on whether Prozac and other similar antidepressants might be linked to violence. ""There's very little likelihood that withdrawal from Prozac could, by itself, cause someone to become violent, said Dr. Nada Stotland, professor of psychiatry at Rush Medical College and president-elect of the American Psychiatric Association. If people with other psychiatric illnesses had a propensity to violence, then discontinuing drug use ""could make them irritable, and that could be one trigger,"" said Stotland, who has accepted speaking fees from the drug industry, but not in recent years. But, she said, ""discontinuation syndrome"" does not cause someone to become violent. ""We understand that tragic and frightening events make people desperate for explanations,"" she said in an e-mail. ""The explanations are seldom simple or straightforward, and, especially when attempts to understand would intrude on the confidentiality of medical records, we seldom know enough about perpetrators' lives and minds to determine just what caused their behaviors."" She added, ""We have much, much more to fear from untreated psychiatric illnesses than from the effects of psychiatric medication."" Dr. Fred Goodwin, research professor of psychiatry at the George Washington University, agreed. ""In general, there is no evidence at all of these drugs producing increases in violence,"" he told CNN. ""If anything, it was a withdrawal effect."" Goodwin, the former director of the National Institute of Mental Health and host of National Public Radio's ""The Infinite Mind,"" said he tells his medical residents ""until I'm blue in the face"" to change doses gradually rather than abruptly. ""You taper up, you taper down,"" he said. Health Canada -- the Canadians' version of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration -- changed its labeling in 2004 for the class of antidepressants to warn that ""patients of all ages taking these drugs may experience behavioral and/or emotional changes that may put them at increased risk of self-harm or harm to others."" And a medication guide approved by the FDA warns of the possibility that users could act ""aggressive, being angry, or violent."" The labeling also cites concern over ""thoughts of suicide"" and ""anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, difficulty sleeping, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, restlessness, or extreme hyperactivity."" Labeling in both countries warns patients not to stop taking the medication abruptly. Baty did not say whether Kazmierczak stopped taking Prozac abruptly or whether he consulted with his psychiatrist prior to doing so. An increased risk of violence occurs around the time of dose transition, according to the FDA. Dose transition is when a person who begins taking an antidepressant changes dose or stops taking it, said Dr. David Healy of the North Wales Department of Psychological Medicine at Cardiff University. Prozac, which has been available in the United States for more than 20 years, is one of a class of drugs called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. They increase the accumulation in the brain of the chemical messenger serotonin, which is linked to feelings of well-being. Though researchers have compiled the most data about Paxil, another antidepressant in the same class of medications, there is ""no reason to think Prozac is any different,"" since all the drugs in that class work the same way, said the British psychiatrist and author of ""Let Them Eat Prozac. ""In the case of Prozac, because of its long half-life, the problems are likely to come several weeks after the last dose,"" said Healy, who has been critical of the drugs and has testified as an expert witness on both sides of the matter. Though millions of people take antidepressants, researchers have had a hard time disentangling the many variables that affect behavior to determine whether the drugs are associated with episodes of violence. But that alone doesn't explain the scant data. A study published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine and carried out by researchers at the Oregon Health & Science University found that the results of almost a third of antidepressant studies were never published, and nearly all of those had concluded that the drug did not work. ""Not only were positive results more likely to be published, but studies that were not positive, in our opinion, were often published in a way that conveyed a positive outcome,"" concluded the authors, led by OHSU's Dr. Erick Turner. ""By altering the apparent risk-benefit ratio of drugs, selective publication can lead doctors to make inappropriate prescribing decisions that may not be in the best interest of their patients and, thus, the public health,"" they concluded. Healy himself wrote one study that did get published, in PLoS Medicine in September 2006. It tallied the overall risk of violence among more than 9,000 antidepressant users at 0.65 percent, more than twice the 0.31 percent seen among people who were taking placebo. But Healy cautioned against concluding that there was indeed a causal relationship between the drug and Kazmierczak's outburst. ""While the data shows the drugs can pose a real risk, in each individual case you still have to look closely for alternate explanations and definitely not assume too quickly that it has been the drug,"" he said. See a professor talk about Kazmierczak's demeanor leading up to the shooting » . Baty's assertion to CNN that Kazmierczak was also taking Xanax, an anti-anxiety agent, and Ambien, a sleep aid, before the NIU shootings, make establishing a causal relationship even more difficult, said psychiatrist Stotland. It is not unusual for doctors to prescribe anti-anxiety agents and sleep medication along with antidepressants, since they can cause anxiety and interfere with sleep, she said. But, she added, ""The more things you add, the more unpredictable things can get."" Dr. Joseph Glenmullen, a clinical instructor in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who has given expert testimony in cases against the pharmaceutical industry, raised concerns about the drug combination Baty said her boyfriend was taking. Prozac withdrawal can make a person irritable and aggressive, and Ambien and Xanax each can cause a person to shed inhibitions, according to the FDA's drug labeling. The result ""could be a pretty deadly combination,"" said Glenmullen, author of ""The Antidepressant Solution - A Step-by-Step Guide to Safely Overcoming Withdrawal, Dependence, and 'Addiction."" He called for ""some governmental organization"" to investigate whether anecdotal reports of violence linked to the drugs are backed up by hard data. A spokesman for Prozac drug maker Eli Lilly and Co. said the cause of the killing spree may remain elusive. ""There is much information that is still unknown about his life and medical history and therefore it may never be known as to why he ultimately chose to take the lives of others as well as himself,"" said spokesman Charles McAtee, in an e-mail. ""Because the authorities have not confirmed at this time any use of a specific medication by this young man, it is not appropriate for us to speculate on the matter. It's important that patients should not stop taking any medication without first talking with their doctor.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Years-old but newly scrutinized videos of MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber ignited a political firestorm this week because the self-described architect of Obamacare thanks ""the stupidity of the American voter"" for leading to passage of the president's signature piece of legislation. With Obamacare open enrollment set to begin over the weekend and the Supreme Court set to weigh in again on the law next year, Republicans pounced, using the videos as additional ammunition in their case that President Barack Obama and his administration misled the American public on Obamacare. Obama on Sunday dismissed the idea that his administration and other proponents of the law misled voters about the legislation, noting that ""we had a yearlong debate."" ""The fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with ... is no reflection on the actual process that was run,"" Obama said. So why should old videos of an economics professor matter? Here's the gist: Gruber called voters stupid, Republicans are calling him the Obamacare architect, and Democrats are calling it all a big misunderstanding. Still confused? This will help: . Was Gruber the ""architect"" of Obamacare? Not exactly. This is a law that was passed by both houses of Congress and written in different forms by several Congressional committees. It's many thousands of pages long and has a myriad of different provisions. But Gruber clearly played an important role in crafting the idea behind the series of exchanges, subsidies and taxes that form the law's centerpiece. He continues to argue the country is better for Obamacare -- but we'll get to that. And he doesn't look nearly as cool as this guy, who actually goes by the name, ""the architect."" So why is he being called that? And what did he actually do? Gruber's work did shape the Affordable Care Act in three key ways: . 1. Gruber played a crucial role in crafting the health care law passed in Massachusetts during then-Gov. Mitt Romney's tenure. Gruber modeled the impact and effectiveness of that state's plans to implement an individual mandate -- the controversial policy that essentially forces people to get covered, or get fined. And this matters because the 2004 Massachusetts law was the model for Obamacare. The ""individual mandate"" became a key component -- and political lightning rod -- of the health care law most people now call Obamacare. Obamacare's next fight for survival . 2. Gruber was hired in 2009 as a consultant by the Obama administration -- and paid nearly $400,000 -- for a year of his work. What'd he do? Gruber has called it ""technical support"" and ""analysis."" What he really did was take a bunch of numbers and model the effects of proposals that would later become the Affordable Care Act. ""If they hadn't had this kind of analysis, well, the law would not be designed as well,"" Gruber said on the O'Reilly Factor last year, discussing his work. 3.  At least eight states called him in to counsel them on how to implement the health care law and set up state-run health insurance exchanges. So he's pretty important to Obamacare. O.K. but this guy is still calling voters stupid! I vote. Am I stupid? No, you're not stupid. At least we don't think so. So why is he calling us voters stupid? Let's first look at what Gruber actually said: He was defending the fact that the law was written behind closed doors and he said Democrats intentionally made the law confusing to mask the fact that the law instituted a new tax to pay for health reform. Why'd the Democrats do this? Voters don't like new taxes. Gruber said it was more important to get health reform than to be up front. ""It's a very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter,"" Gruber said at the Honors Colloquium 2012 at the University of Rhode Island. And: ""They proposed it and that passed, because the American people are too stupid to understand the difference,"" he said at Washington University at St. Louis in 2013. The brunt of Gruber's argument is that policymakers crafting the law had to take politics into account. And politics means that politicians prefer to vote for a tax on insurance companies that will ultimately get passed on to consumers, rather than voting for a tax on consumers outright, for example. Gruber's ""stupid"" comments are summed up his contention that people don't want to pay more taxes, even when they want cheaper or better things. For instance: . - Want better public education? - Sure! - Want to pay higher taxes to improve public education? - Eh... This also applies to voting for the individual mandate ""penalty,"" as the Obama administration refers to it, rather than a ""tax,"" as the Supreme Court ruled in 2012. And it turns out that Gruber always knew a tax on expensive insurance plans would eventually grow to hit almost every insurance plan. He admitted as much in yet another video that surfaced on Friday. The White House and Democrats, by the way, promised up and down that the so-called ""cadillac tax"" wouldn't affect most Americans. The guy who thinks voters are 'stupid' But the controversy over whether the mandate is a ""tax"" isn't news, right? Nope. But it is giving Republicans' claims that the Obama administration misled voters on the ""truth"" of the Affordable Care Act more credence. So why are Democrats trying to distance themselves from Gruber? Democrats clearly don't want Obamacare tarnished anymore than it already has because of one guy. And they definitely don't want him to be the face of Obamacare or Democrats' view on the law. What they're trying to do is downplay Gruber's role in crafting the law. On Sunday, President Obama speaking from the G20 summit in Australia called him ""some adviser who never worked on our staff."" Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Gruber ""didn't help write our bill"" and claimed not to ""know who he is."" She wasn't being entirely up front on that point. Pelosi actually cited Gruber's work approvingly in 2009 and even mentioned him by name in an interview that same year. Obamacare architect discussed misleading public in 4th newly uncovered video . Was Gruber making a larger point here that we're missing? Definitely. If you can get past his condescending tone and insults, Gruber's speeches actually offer some insight into how policy is impacted by politics. ""If you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in -- if you made it explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed, OK?"" Gruber said. And while the (impartial) jury on the Affordable Care Act is still out, the law has lowered that national uninsured rate and, so far, the law is proving to be cheaper than expected. Either way, Gruber has said he believes the U.S. is better off with Obamacare than without it. And if less transparency helps implement better policy, he's O.K. with that. But am I? Are you? You make that call. Third video emerges of Obamacare architect insulting voters .","Gruber called voters stupid, the GOP is calling him the Obamacare architect, and Dems are calling it all a misunderstanding .
Gruber played a crucial role in crafting the law and its Massachusetts model, but isn't ""the architect"" of the law .
Gruber's ""stupid"" comments came as he explained the lack of transparency in selling the law to have it pass .

"(CNN) -- Apple and Facebook made the headlines last week on the news that they are offering coverage for their female employees to freeze their eggs. Financial support for egg-freezing represents a bold step by these tech leaders, intended to support women as they manage the modern-day conflict between work and family. It is also the latest incarnation of technological optimism, a belief in quick fixes for complex social, political and cultural issues. But women and men everywhere should be suspicious of egg-freezing as a ""solution."" Egg-freezing has its history in a century of experiments applying cold to reproductive cells to maximize productivity. Cattle breeders in the mid-1900s began freezing bull semen so they could impregnate many cows all at once by the same bull. In this way they could standardize and control conception to generate the highest profits. The techniques developed in agriculture traveled to fertility clinics, and today a similar logic prevails in human sperm banks. As commentators have been quick to point out, human egg-freezing is a new technology that carries bodily risk and high rates of failure. To stockpile eggs in the freezer, women self-inject powerful hormones for several weeks before undergoing outpatient surgery. In the short term, women face risks from the drugs and egg retrieval procedure. As for the long term, there are zero longitudinal studies on the health effects of exposing women's bodies to fertility medications. And because of high failure rates, even if women go through all this trouble, fewer than 3 in 10 will end up with a baby. But even if the technology were perfect, the proposal to help women put motherhood on ice so they can focus on their jobs is shortsighted. Historically, the relationship between technology and women's work has been complicated. For example, as Ruth Schwartz Cowan argued in the classic ""More Work for Mother,"" the introduction of household technologies like the vacuum cleaner added to women's workload by raising standards of cleanliness to new heights. Egg-freezing is a technological response to a situation that results from an earlier pharmaceutical fix for work-life balance: the birth control pill. As the historian Elaine Tyler May documents, women used the pill to delay childbearing and enter the workforce. But when women initiate families later in life, they can have difficulty conceiving. The pill helped contribute to the current situation in which birth control and children are seen as a woman's choice and responsibility -- and men, employers and governments need not adapt. New corporate policies supporting egg-freezing replicate this problem. Indeed, the structural organization of work has proved more inflexible than women's ovaries. At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when wage labor was being regularized, workers were compelled (sometimes via force and sometimes via incentives) to show up on time and to order their lives along the expectations of their employers. The tech industry has reconfigured the places and even the hours that people work, but it still sets a very demanding pace. What's more, women now constitute almost half of all workers. And rather than making fundamental changes to the structure of work in our society to accommodate women's reproductive years, technological optimists reach for an engineering solution. Have a conflict between women's biological clock and work productivity? Freeze the eggs. Instead, the goal should be to build systems of production that allow us to live our lives without constantly watching the clock. For example, Princeton political scientist Anne-Marie Slaughter has proposed aligning the work day with the school day. To be sure, men also feel pulled by the competing demands of work and family, and there is growing scientific evidence that they too have biological clocks. A recent study published in the journal Nature demonstrated that with every passing year, men's sperm is more likely to contain harmful genetic mutations that contribute to their children's risk of autism and schizophrenia. Will Apple and Facebook suggest to their male employees that they freeze sperm in order to postpone fatherhood? Freezing eggs appears to make reproduction controllable, but one cannot freeze time. Even if cells can be hoarded and stored, time cannot. Time and life and bodies march on; we age, even if our reproductive materials are transformed into frozen assets. Egg-freezing may be an optimal choice for some women, but it is not a solution to the overwhelming pressures that result from companies requiring long work hours and constant availability. Instead, we must demand policies that have been demonstrated to alleviate the strain for mothers and fathers alike: a living wage, reasonable work hours, paid parental leave, and child care. Freezing eggs simply defers the pressures of today to tomorrow.","Writers: Apple, Facebook offer coverage for women employees freezing their eggs .

"(CNN)Let's call this NFL game balls for dummies. Oh, don't take offense. Up until a few days ago, when the Deflategate ""scandal"" broke, we were all dummies when it came to the esoterica of NFL ball rules. Hell, let's be honest; we were imbeciles. Now, we're learning all sorts of fancy things about the league's regulations and how teams and referees handle footballs before and during a game. For instance, did you know the ball must be a ""prolate spheroid""? And did you know that before today, the term ""prolate spheroid"" had appeared on CNN.com only four times in its history? Perhaps that's for the better. Anyway, you've got questions, and as so often is the case, we have answers. Let's get pumped up! (Sorry, it's tough for writers to resist a play on words, no matter how terrible.) What on Earth is going on? The NFL is investigating the New England Patriots to determine why 11 of the 12 game balls they provided for Sunday's AFC Championship game were under-inflated by about 2 pounds per square inch each. The Pats supplied their own balls? Isn't that letting the fox watch the hen house? Wellllllll, for lack of a more elaborate answer ... yes? According to NFL regulations, each team provides a dozen balls to the referee for testing two hours and 15 minutes before kickoff. The home team also supplies 12 backup balls, and for outdoor games, the visiting team has the option of bringing another 12 balls. In addition, the ball manufacturer -- in this case, Wilson (cue ""Cast Away"" jokes) -- ships eight more balls, in what the NFL scientifically terms ""a special box,"" directly to the referee. The box is opened two hours and 15 minutes before the game, and the referee marks each ball with a ""K,"" to designate it for kicking. ESPN writer Kate Fagan pointed out the curiosity of the regulation in an appearance on ""Around the Horn"" on Wednesday. When Fagan played college basketball, she said, the referees brought out NCAA-supplied balls an hour before the game. Those balls were used for warmups and the game, and they were not to leave the court, she said. If the NCAA has such a rule for women's basketball games, she posited, how can the ludicrously profitable NFL not provide its own game balls? A fine question. Who's in charge of making sure balls are up to snuff? ""The Referee shall be the sole judge as to whether all balls offered for play comply with these specifications. A pump is to be furnished by the home club, and the balls shall remain under the supervision of the Referee until they are delivered to the ball attendant just prior to the start of the game,"" NFL rules state. The ball attendant transports the footballs to the field, and ball boys keep them on the sideline, ESPN reports. Ball boys are usually vetted by teams and paid by the NFL and can be sons or daughters of team employees, the network reports. So it was the ball boy! Yes, with a candlestick in the conservatory. That's a joke. If the NFL had pinpointed a culprit, CNN wouldn't need to devote writers to deciphering the league's game-ball rules. What other rules pertain to a game ball? As mentioned, it has to be a prolate spheroid, which in layman's terms means ""shaped like a football,"" and it has to be signed by Commissioner Roger Goodell -- as opposed to, say, Kate Upton or ""Weird"" Al Yankovic. It should have between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds of air per square inch and weigh 14 to 15 ounces. It should have a long axis of 11 to 11.25 inches, a long circumference of 28 to 28.5 inches and a short circumference of 21 to 21.25 inches. And, perhaps most importantly, it needs to be constructed of a urethane bladder encased in pebble-grained leather of ""natural tan color."" So, no purple footballs. Why would someone deflate the balls? It supposedly makes them easier to grip for the quarterback and receivers. That would've been especially important in the wet conditions in which the AFC Championship was played. Is it always an advantage? Eh, unclear. Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers allegedly once told commentator and former quarterback Phil Simms that he could get a better grip on an over-inflated ball. How was the issue even raised? In the second half of Sunday's game, Indianapolis Colts linebacker D'Qwell Jackson intercepted Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. According to Newsday, he took the ball to his team's equipment staff, which then informed head coach Chuck Pagano, who told general manager Ryan Grigson, who told NFL director of football operations Mike Kensil, who told the officials on the field. This should remind you of that kindergarten game where you sat in a circle whispering things in your classmates' ears to demonstrate how messages are lost as they're conveyed from one person to the next. Thus, it's entirely possible Jackson told the equipment staff he wanted to go for pizza after the game, and by the time it got to the officials we had Deflategate. What about the wing official and umpire who spot the ball before each play? Wouldn't they have noticed? Hmm, you would think so. Has this ever happened before? There are lots of tales of ball manipulation surfacing in the wake of Deflategate, but one particular story stands out. In 2012, the University of Southern California, which kind of has this thing for cheating, was accused of under-inflating balls used in a game against the Oregon Ducks. The school was reprimanded and fined, and a student-manager was axed when he conceded that he had under-inflated the balls after the officials had approved them. The unnamed student said he did it all by his lonesome, and no other USC coach, staff member or administrator had any knowledge of his shenanigans. Could weather have played a role? There have been numerous reports that cold weather can diminish ball pressure, which would normally be pertinent for the Boston area ... except that it was 51 degrees in Foxborough, Massachusetts, at kickoff. Is it possible Patriots coach Bill Belichick knew? Outside of Massachusetts, the general public puts Belichick somewhere on par with Whitey Bulger, so you'll find no shortage of people who say, ""Oh, most definitely,"" especially after Spygate. The coach says, however, ""In my entire coaching career, I have never talked to any player (or) staff member about football air pressure."" What about Brady? Asked about it Monday on a Boston radio show, the three-time Super Bowl winner responded, ""I don't even respond to stuff like this."" He also responded by calling the accusation ""ridiculous."" On Thursday, he told reporters he didn't alter the balls and assured them, ""I've always played by the rules."" At least one football icon has his doubts that Gisele Bundchen's lesser half was not complicit. In one of the most damning non-accusations in history, Hall of Fame coach John Madden told The Sports Xchange he believed Belichick was clueless about the ball pressure, but ""I can see -- and you hate to make examples of what you can see because that sounds like you are accusing someone -- but I can see that being between the quarterback and the equipment guy."" He also said, ""That's something that wouldn't be driven by a coach or just the equipment guy. Nobody, not even the head coach, would do anything to the football unilaterally, such as adjust the amount of pressure in a ball, without the quarterback not knowing. It would have to be the quarterback's idea."" What to make of that? No idea, but they did name the greatest video game the world has ever known after the dude. Has the rest of the team spoken up? Several Patriots have called the controversy ""stupid"" and accused the media of fueling the controversy. (For what it's worth, this writer is willing to bet his pinkies no journalist is responsible for deflating the balls.) Do the Pats forfeit the win if they're found guilty? Ridiculously unlikely (sorry, Indianapolis), but they could be fined and docked a draft pick. After Spygate, the league took away a Patriots' first-round draft pick, fined the team $250,000 and fined Belichik $500,000, but don't expect anything that serious in Deflategate. Could the ball pressure really have played that large a factor? Similarly unlikely. The Pats won 45-7, and 28 of their points came in the second half -- after the game officials had pumped the balls back up to their regulation pressure. You make the call. Then why is this such a big deal? See earlier remark regarding Belichick and Bulger. Also, there's this game coming up two Sundays from now called the Super Bowl ...","NFL investigating whether New England Patriot under-inflated 11 footballs .

"Prosecutors in Billings, Montana are looking for legal standing to fight a 30-day sentence handed down to a teacher who admitted to raping his 14-year-old student. The girl later took her own life. ""This case is very important. As I've said before, this resulted in the loss of one of our young people in my community,"" said Scott Twito, a prosecutor with the Yellowstone County attorney's office. ""We take these charges very seriously. And we fight for those victims."" He said he strongly disagrees with the sentence District Judge G. Todd Baugh gave to Stacey Dean Rambold this week. CNN obtained a copy of a memo from Twito's office to the Montana attorney general's office, which is reviewing the case. In the letter, attorneys argue the relevant statue was ""misapplied and the minimum sentence that could be imposed in Rambold's case was two years."" As prosecutors weigh a possible appeal, hundreds of protesters rallied at a Billings courthouse Thursday, demanding the judge step down. The protest was organized in part by the National Organization for Women. Demonstrators waved signs and called for a review of Baugh's prior caseload, a reporter from CNN affiliate KTVQ said. One poster read simply: ""Resign."" Another said: ""Justice 4 Cherice,"" referring to the teenage victim in the case, Cherice Moralez. ""The demand and goal of this is to ask the judge to resign. The broader message is to really unite as a community against victim-blaming,"" said protest organizer Sheena Davis, adding that the protest aimed to address ""a larger issue on how we protect children from rape in this justice system."" So far, more than 33,000 people have signed a petition at MoveOn.org, demanding that Baugh resign. ""I told them the judge was wrong"" Cherice's mother is outraged that Rambold, who admitted raping the girl while he was a teacher at her high school, received only a month in prison, whereas Cherice took her own life. ""It discourages other kids from coming forward. If they come forward, what's going to happen? Nothing,"" Auliea Hanlon, told CNN in an interview that aired Thursday night. She struggled to speak as she talked about trying to explain the sentence to her other children. ""They said, 'Oh, did he hurt her mom?' Well, yes he did. 'Oh, what happened to him?' Nothing,"" she said, adding: ""I told them the judge was wrong."" In earlier interviews, Hanlon said she was particularly upset that the judge said Cherice ""seemed older than her chronological age"" and was ""as much in control of the situation"" as the teacher. ""How could she be in control of the situation? He was a teacher. She was a student. She wasn't in control of anything. She was 14,"" Hanlon told CNN. Baugh apologized on Wednesday. ""I made some references to the victim's age and control,"" he told KTVQ. ""I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say at that point, but it didn't come out correct. What I said was demeaning to all women, not what I believe in and irrelevant to the sentencing."" About the sentencing itself, Baugh said he would file an addendum to the case file to ""better explain"" his rationale. Case details . The case began in 2008 when Cherice, then 14, was a student at Billings Senior High School and Rambold, then 49, was a teacher. Hanlon claims Rambold's ""pre-sexual grooming"" of her daughter led to the pair having sex. School officials learned of the relationship, and Rambold resigned. Later that year, authorities charged Rambold with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent. ""It's not probably the kind of rape most people think about,"" Baugh said. ""It was not a violent, forcible, beat-the-victim rape, like you see in the movies. But it was nonetheless a rape. It was a troubled young girl, and he was a teacher. And this should not have occurred."" As the case wound its way through the legal system, Cherice committed suicide. She was a few weeks shy of her 17th birthday. ""As a result of the sexual assault and its aftermath, (Cherice) experienced severe emotional distress, humiliation and embarrassment and fell into irreversible depression that tragically led to her taking her own life on February 6, 2010,"" Hanlon said in a complaint filed against Rambold. Hanlon told CNN the relationship was to blame for her daughter's death. ""Well, it definitely had something to do with it,"" she said. ""A teenager's whole life is about school and their friends, and he turned everyone against her."" NYC police: Teacher accused of raping 10-year-old student . The agreement . With Cherice's death, the prosecution entered into what is known as a ""deferred prosecution agreement"" with Rambold. This meant that all charges against Rambold would be dismissed if he completed a sex-offender treatment program and met other requirements. One of them was to have no contact with children. Rambold admitted to one of the rape charges. But the ex-teacher fell short of the agreement. ""He had some contacts with nieces and nephews in a family setting and other adults were present,"" Baugh said. He also had relationships with women that he didn't tell his counselors about. ""That is a violation from his deferred prosecution so he was dropped from the plan."" As a result, the case was revived in December 2012. Canadian teen commits suicide after alleged rape . The hearing . At a hearing Monday, prosecutors asked the judge to send Rambold away for 20 years. The defense argued that Rambold has suffered enough. His lawyers said he lost his career and his marriage and has the ""scarlet letter of the Internet"" due to the publicity surrounding the case, the Billings Gazette reported. Baugh ruled that Rambold's infractions weren't serious enough. ""He made some violations of his treatment program,"" he said. ""They were more technical and not the kind you would send someone to prison for."" He sentenced Rambold to 15 years in prison. Then, he suspended all but 31 days of the sentence, according to the Yellowstone County District Court. In addition, the judge gave him credit for one day he spent in jail. Incredulous at what had happened, Hanlon shouted at the court, ""You people suck!"" ""She wasn't even old enough to get a driver's license,"" Hanlon said in a statement released by her attorney. ""But Judge Baugh, who never met our daughter, justified the paltry sentence saying she was older than her chronological age. I guess somehow it makes a rape more acceptable if you blame the victim, even if she was only 14."" Baugh has defended his ruling. He told CNN he believes Rambold is ""treatable"" and a ""low risk to re-offend."" Two videotaped interviews with Cherice -- one with the police department and one with the defense attorney -- were played in court, he said. ""She seemed older than her chronological age,"" Baugh said. ""Basically what we had was a troubled young girl."" He added, ""I simply did not have the evidence to conclude that her taking her life was because of her sexual offense by Mr. Rambold.""

"If you've never been to a Japanese onsen, there's one tiny bit of protocol worth knowing before you plunge into those steamy waters. Nudity isn't just the norm, it's the rule. A testament to the shock some of us Japan first timers experience upon learning we have to doff our skivvies to take part in the country's favorite holiday past time, multilingual signs are frequently posted outside the more popular hot springs to outline onsen etiquette. The best ones have hilarious cartoon depictions for added emphasis. Things are no different at historic Sakinoyu Onsen, a gorgeous hot spring facility right on the coast of Shirahama in Japan's Wakayama prefecture. One of the three most revered onsens in Japan and more than 1,300 years old, it's mentioned in historic Japanese texts and was once visited by emperors and noblemen. But you still have to get naked. Nowhere to hide . At the entrance of the wooden building, visitors enter through the men (blue) or women's (red) doors to reach changing rooms which open up to a series of beautiful stone pools filled with natural mineral waters, edged only by the Pacific Ocean. A high wooden wall divides ladies and gents. The manager of Sakinoyu says that on the days when the sea is rough, waves are known to crash over the rocks, giving bathers a refreshing cool down. ""We've had foreign tourists get too hot and decide they want to take a naked dip in the ocean, only to be pulled away by the current and in need of rescue,"" he says with a laugh, adding that this actually isn't allowed. A wall of huge rocks keeps the women safe from outsiders' eyes, but the men aren't so fortunate. Their pools are easily viewed from several rooms in the nearby Hotel Seamore, as well as a viewing platform, where I find myself barely an hour later. Did I dare look across the shining waters to ""see more""? Of course. Admittedly, I'm not much of a voyeur. At the first blurry glimpse of naked male flesh I direct my eyes anywhere but that onsen. Aussie sands, chilly waters . Shirahama isn't just about historical hot tubs and naked humans. It's beautifully compact, centered around a long, blindingly white beach -- the sand was imported from Australia -- book ended by impressive rock formations, fishing piers, free onsen foot baths and a few kitschy attractions. Dotted with aging hotels, Shirahama Beach has a seaside resort vibe that takes off in the summer, with street vendors and nightly fireworks. As I walk across its white sands, I'm floored by how unexpected it feels to find such a beach outside of semi-tropical Okinawa. The beach is so pristine I feel I could be in the Caribbean. That illusion is shattered by dipping my feet in the ocean to be reminded with a jolt that Japan's coastal waters are still chilly in May. Nonetheless, proving yet again my theory that children possess underdeveloped thermoreceptors, many kids splash about happily nearby. Back up on shore, the open-air Shirasuna beachside onsen -- swimsuits permitted -- is a nice way to warm up post swim. Made for breeding giant pandas . Shirahama is a hot spot for Japanese families, due in part to the presence of Adventure World. No ordinary theme park, Adventure World also has a zoo that is home to five giant pandas -- the most of any zoo in Japan -- including twins born in 2010. It's credited with having one of the the most successful panda-breeding programs outside of China, and is the Japanese branch of China's famed Chengdu Panda Research Base. References to the local celebs can be found all over the town, in the form of kawaii (cute) souvenirs and signage. Pirate hideaways and one giant rock tatami mat . Another top attraction is Shirahama's Sandanbeki cliffs and caverns. Up to two kilometers of steep cliffs, some 50 meters high, make up this stunning site, where birds of prey regularly circle overhead. Visitors can take an elevator down 35 meters to the underground caves (open daily, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.) to see where the ocean rushes in. There's also a small exhibit showing how Kumano pirates of the Heian era (794-1185) used the caves as hiding spots. Nearby is Senjojiki rock. Eroded by thousands of years of sea action, the rock's name loosely translates to ""1,000 tatami mats,"" supposedly because it resembles the popular Japanese flooring material. Engetsu Island . Shirahama's rock stars don't end there. Engetsu Island is a 130-meter-wide rock formation, famous for the moon-like hole in the middle. Designated a ""place of scenic beauty of Japan"", it's easily viewed from a road on the nearby mainland. At sunset, the sun appears right in the center of the hole, making it a favorite with photographers. Where to eat/shop . Shirahama is all about seafood. I had a fabulous seafood BBQ meal at Shirahama's recently opened pier-side Fisherman's Wharf. The venue has an Italian restaurant and a Japanese restaurant, but the real prize is the rooftop Club Caribbean joint with its views of the nearby beach. Here, diners can choose live seafood from the market on the main floor and cook it themselves on a little grill. For those who find watching shellfish writhe on hot metal a bit too gruesome, there's a non-seafood menu of beef and pork. Just outside of Shirahama lies the massive Tore Tore Ichiba Market. Visitors can take in a tuna cutting demonstration and shop for seafood, produce, fruit and countless Japanese souvenirs. There are also a few quality dining options, including a food court and a seafood BBQ spot where you can cook up the fresh seafood you just bought at the market. The local brew . Umeshu is Shirahama's drink of choice. A few kilometers outside Shirahama on the way to the city of Tanabe sits Nakata, one of Wakayama's biggest ume (Japanese apricot) fruit processing and brewing factories, which is open for tours. ""Everything is carried out by hand, as the fruit is too delicate to be handled with machines,"" explains Nakata's president, Yoshiaki Nakata, whose great grandfather founded the company. Where to stay . The 109-room Kaisyu Hotel (rates from 23,500 yen/$229) offers great food, private onsens, comfortable Japanese and Western rooms with sunset views, plus a few cliffside cottages. Upon check in, guests leave their shoes at the door and are invited to select from a variety of Japanese yukata (robes) or samue (shirt/pant combo). It's rather fun seeing everyone plodding around in their bare feet through the lobby, wearing their robes to dinner. The hotel is lacking in English speakers/materials, but staff are very friendly and make an effort. Travel/contact info . Shirahama Station is two hours and 30 minutes from Shin Osaka station on the JR Kinokuni Line Express Train. The town has a decent bus system that will get you to many of the major stops, including Adventure World, the beach, Sakinoyu Onsen, Tore Tore Market and Sandanbeki.

"Fiery asteroids smash into Earth's atmosphere at such a stunning rate, it's a wonder we don't see fireballs raining down from the skies more frequently. A new NASA map from the space agency's Near-Earth Object Program, reveals that more than 556 space rocks smashed into the atmosphere over a 20-year period between 1994 and 2013. NASA's Near Earth Object Program . The good news is most are small and harmless fireballs that disintegrate when they hit the atmosphere, the space agency said in a press release. An obvious exception occurred on February 15, 2013, when an asteroid as large as 55 feet in diameter with a mass of up to 10,000 tons crashed to earth in the Urals region in Russia, streaking through the morning sky in Chelyabinsk before landing in a fiery explosion that injured more than a thousand people and caused an estimated $33 million in damage. Russia starts cleanup after meteor strike . NASA said the Chelyabinsk asteroid was the largest to hit the Earth during the agency's mapping period. Meteor streaks across Russian skies . Meteor blast at local school . Asteroids are defined by NASA as rocky bodies in space that orbit the Sun. Some of them are large enough to be considered minor planets. When pieces of an asteroid or comet break off from the main body, they're referred to as meteroids. A meteor is actually the light that is seen in the sky when a meteoroid enters Earth's atmosphere. A meteor shower is seen when lots of these smaller particles fall to Earth. According to NASA, meteroids are usually small, but can range ""from dust particle to boulder size."" Meteor showers put on quite a show . The NEO Program helps detect and track space rocks that could cause a potential danger to Earth. ""The new data could help scientists better refine estimates of the distribution of the sizes of NEOs,"" NASA explained. ""Finding and characterizing hazardous asteroids to protect our home planet is a high priority."" The space agency has increased its efforts at finding and tracking potentially dangerous space objects with the idea of developing ways to protect the Earth from one, should it ever become necessary. NASA is also developing an Asteroid Redirect Mission called ARM. In a plan that sounds a lot like science fiction, NASA wants to redirect a space rock into orbit around the moon by the 2020s so astronauts can study it more closely. The mission could also help develop ways to deflect an asteroid should one be found on a collision course for Earth.

"For 15 years, Ashley Broadway has devoted her life to the military and to her spouse, an Army lieutenant colonel. The former schoolteacher found a new job and made new friends each time she had to relocate bases, including a move to South Korea. When a deployment to the Middle East separated the couple, Broadway took care of the couple's young son, Carson, on her own. Now at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and with a second child on the way, Broadway wanted to settle down and get to know more spouses like herself. So she applied for membership to the Association of Bragg Officers' Spouses. ""I thought, 'Here's a chance to make some close friends who would really understand me,'"" Broadway said. ""And I could get very active in events that help other families like mine. I was excited, really excited, to be a part of this group."" But the Bragg spouse club apparently didn't feel the same way. Broadway's married to Lt. Col. Heather Mack. The officers' spouse club didn't want her, she believes, because she's gay. Shortly after Broadway applied, the club called her to say it had new membership rules. If she didn't have a military ID card, she couldn't join. The couple is legally married -- reciting their vows during a November ceremony in Washington, D.C., and signing a state marriage certificate. Broadway's experience may reflect a struggle at the nation's military bases to adapt culturally to the legal changes brought on by 2011's repeal of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. Brass at Fort Bragg told CNN that they had no control over the spouse club because it's not a military group, but a private one. Though gay people can now serve openly, the military doesn't formally recognize same-sex marriage under the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a law passed in 1996 that denies many benefits to same-sex spouses. One of those benefits is military IDs. The cards are an essential part of military life, allowing holders to get on base, access child care or go to the commissary. Same-sex married couple sues federal government in DOMA case . Members-only card . ""The cards are also a big symbol,"" Broadway recalled. ""So there I am listening to this person with this club tell me I can't join as I'm struggling to get my 2-year-old out of the car and into the house. And I just kept hearing over and over, 'You don't have an ID. You don't have an ID.' I was hearing it as, 'You are not equal. You are less.'"" Her voice breaks. ""I kept thinking that if these people just met me, they would like me,"" she said, crying. When Broadway hung up, she grabbed a laundry basket and began furiously folding clothes in her bedroom. She texted a friend who is also gay, also married to a service member and was himself in the military years ago. ""How can anyone not in our position know how this feels?"" she asked. By that night, she was just plain angry. No way was she just going to go away quietly. Broadway posted an open letter to the club on the American Military Partner Association, the nation's go-to support network for gay, lesbian and transgender military families. Another club rejection . AMPA launched a petition not only for Broadway but also for other spouses who've tried and were barred from joining similar clubs, including Tanisha Ward. Ward, who's married to a female Airman 1st Class, asked to join The Little Rock Spouses' Club near Little Rock Air Force Base in Jacksonville, Arkansas, in September. The club rejected Ward, she says, because she doesn't have a military-issued ID. But the group appears to be rethinking its stance. Its website suggests the club might be considering new membership rules that a military ID card is not necessary to join, adding that no one should be blocked from membership because of sexual orientation. ""They've told me they're going to meet this month to decide,"" Ward said. ""I hope they do the right thing."" But no luck for Broadway, whose name trended for weeks on Twitter. Her story is the talk in military circles, with Stars and Stripes writing about it and Fort Bragg's community posting comments online. ""This is about more than a spouse who wants to get into a club,"" says UCLA Law School's Aaron Belkin, who helped write the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell."" ""This is about the Defense of Marriage Act and all the inequalities that come with it. It's about asking the question: Is the military really going to be serious about giving fair and equal treatment?"" Some of the other federal benefits that are available to married heterosexual couples but are denied to same-sex spouses include insurance and survivor's benefits. Straight spouses are able to file joint tax returns. The U.S. Supreme Court will begin hearing arguments about the constitutionality of DOMA in March. Unexpected allies in marriage votes . A spouse is a spouse . That offers little comfort to Broadway and her supporters, such as Bianca Strzalkowski, the 2011 Military Spouse of the Year. Hundreds of thousands of military members voted to give Strzalkowski that title, singling her out for her community service, patriotism and time spent helping military families. She lives in North Carolina but has no affiliation with the spouse club that rejected Broadway. ""It really makes me ill to think this is happening at Fort Bragg,"" she told CNN. ""It's discrimination, plain and simple."" Strzalkowski is also the deputy membership director of Blue Star Families -- the largest military family support organization in the nation. A Blue Star column recently lambasted the spouse club for rejecting Broadway. ""Who would have thought a group whose sole existence is to help other military spouses and families would deny one of their own?..."" military wife Molly Blake wrote. ""Ashley Broadway -- I don't care if you are gay. I care that you are a dedicated military spouse who supports your soldier. I care that you want to be an example to other spouses and volunteer your time for the benefit of others. ""I care that you are willing to set up chairs and tables for fundraisers, bring new and innovative ways to raise money for our neediest military families, collate bid sheets, make brownies and raise your hand when the president needs a volunteer."" Strzalkowski's Marine husband is preparing to ship out on his fifth deployment, this time to Afghanistan. ""We've gone through 11 years of war, and we need to be supporting each other -- not treating each other like this,"" she said. ""I don't feel that this club at Fort Bragg represents who we are as spouses."" No help from Bragg brass . CNN's many attempts to get the club's side of the story have been unsuccessful. Two women who confirmed that they belonged to the club chose not to comment. A December 12 letter on the club's home page reads: ""In response to recent interest in the membership requirements of our organization we will review the issue at our next board meeting."" The letter doesn't indicate when the meeting will be. In the wake of the controversy, the group's website has password protected all its links. ""They've locked themselves off to the world!"" says Strzalkowski. ""No one should be that high up on their pedestal."" Bragg brass says their power is limited. That's because, according to Fort Bragg Garrison Commander Col. Jeffrey Sanborn, the club is a private group, not a military one. Sanborn declined an interview with CNN, but he e-mailed statements saying he explained that in person to Broadway and her wife. Officially, Sanborn has the power only to ensure ""all private organizations operating on Fort Bragg comply with Department of Defense and Army regulations and with U.S. laws."" And the spouse club's bylaws, constitution and conduct do comply with DOD regulations. ""C'mon, really? That's a little disingenuous,"" said UCLA's Belkin. ""When you're the commander at Fort Bragg, you are close to having godlike status in your community."" Sanborn could deny the club access to the base, Belkin said. ""He could tell service members not to participate. There are a lot of ways to send a signal that you disapprove."" At home this week, Broadway and Mack are busy around the house. Mack is days away from giving birth. Broadway talks as she heads home from a visit to the doctor. After all this, does Broadway still want to be part of the Association of Bragg Officers' Spouses? ""Honestly, I'm torn,"" she said. ""Each day that goes by, they are saying they don't want me. I check my spam folder every day to make sure I haven't missed a message from them. ""I wonder if it would be best if I focus on a group who would value me.""","In North Carolina, Fort Bragg spouse club bars same-sex wife of a lieutenant colonel .

"(CNN) -- Far-right and far-left protest parties have dominated the crucial election in many countries across the European Union . The euroskeptics -- from the UKIP in the United Kingdom to National Front in France -- are demanding tighter border controls, nationalized decision-making and a dissolution of the currency union. There are several reasons for the surge in support, including the disillusionment of those caught in the backdraft of economic crisis and a desire by some voters to punish the political establishment. But while the euroskeptic parties are expected to claim a significant chunk of votes, their power inside the parliament will likely to be diluted by a lack of cooperation. They have little in common aside from a dislike of the Brussels bureaucracy, and a pan-euroskeptic political group is unlikely, according to political scientist Duncan McDonnell. ""The euroskeptic label covers parties of both right and left, many of whom object to the EU for very different reasons -- the radical left denounce Europe as a free-market promoting friend of high finance, while the right objects to a loss of national sovereignty and bureaucracy,"" said McDonnell, a political science fellow at the European University Institute in Florence. However, the rise in euroskeptic parties' political clout is likely to put pressure on national governments of the member states. Five years after the financial crisis exploded, the call for change with the bloc has become louder. With protest parties coming top in several key member states, the decades-old institution could face a shake-up that will rewrite its future. Nina dos Santos: The European Union needs a new vision .

"Mark Zuckerberg approaches self-improvement like a software engineer. Every year, the Facebook CEO sets some sort of challenge for himself. In 2010, he tried to learn Mandarin. In 2009, he vowed to wear a tie to work every day to show he was serious about Facebook's growth (and possibly get  a break from the signature T-shirt and hoodie he wears to every public event). The annual challenges sometimes make headlines, most famously in 2011 when Zuck vowed to eat animals only if he had killed them himself. That pronouncement led to a mixture of backlash and praise from animal-rights activists. This year, the famously introverted Zuckerberg is seeking out more conversations with actual humans. ""This year, my challenge is to meet a new person outside of Facebook every day,"" he said Wednesday at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference. According to Zuckerberg's own rules, he needs to have a face-to-face conversation with the person, not just shake hands or chat online. Oh, this could be awkward. ""Hi! I'm Mark. I'm a Taurus. What do you love most about Facebook?"" 10 fun facts about Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg . But Zuckerberg said the challenges are a way to open himself up to new perspectives. ""Doing something for a year, I think you have all these interesting unintended consequences,"" said Zuckeberg. The year of killing animals led Zuckerberg to become more vegetarian. While learning Mandarin, he had Mandarin-speaking Facebook employees come to his office for conversation practice. He ended up learning about parts of the company he normally wouldn't have had interactions with and even had some realizations about himself. ""I was complaining to my wife one day that I was never that good at listening in Mandarin and she goes, 'Mark, you're not good at listening in English, either.' "" This year's challenge has already led to one very noticeable outcome: the founding of Fwd.us, a lobbying group started by Zuckerberg to advocate for immigration reform in the United States. When planning his year of face-to-face chats, Zuckerberg said he joined community organizations and started teaching a class at a local middle school to have more opportunities to meet non-Facebookers. While teaching the class, he asked about his students' college plans and was shocked when one boy said he didn't know if he could go to college because he was undocumented. Zuckerberg believes immigration reform could also have a positive impact on tech companies hungry for talented programmers from other countries. The tech wunderkind said the annual challenges are also meant to test his willpower. ""I think a lot of building something is just about kind of seeing things through. And so I try to pick things that are going to be hard for me to do,"" he said. His goal for 2013 has been less challenging than he expected. As it turns out, the globetrotting head of a huge technology company meets a number of new people almost every day in the course of his job. ""It's actually turned out to be really easy,"" Zuckerberg said. ""I sandbagged this one."" CNNMoney: IPO made Facebook stronger, Zuckerberg says .

"(CNN)As the search for AirAsia Flight QZ8501 stretched into its eighth day, the Java Sea continued to slowly give up the remains of the 162 victims aboard the ill-fated flight, as well as wreckage of the aircraft. At least four more bodies were recovered on Sunday, bringing the count to 34. The remains were transferred by helicopter to the processing center in Pangkalan Bun, Indonesia, to the north of the search area. The developments came as Indonesian officials announced that they had identified three more bodies -- two female passengers and a male flight attendant. Additional wreckage was spotted overnight, measuring almost 10 meters (33 feet) by 1 meter. Sunday's progress was not as great as searchers had hoped. It was forecast to be the best day weather-wise for the search, but choppy seas once again hindered the operation. Initial compensation offered . As many endured the agonizing wait for news of their loved ones, CNN obtained details of initial compensation packages from AirAsia to the families of the victims. Several family members told CNN on Sunday that families of those on board the plane were presented with a draft letter from AirAsia outlining details of preliminary compensation. The letter states that families are entitled to about $24,000 for each family member who was on the plane. While some families signed the letter, others requested revisions to the wording. This compensation money is for any ""financial hardships"" during this period of the search, and in the letters AirAsia stressed that it was not a confirmation that their family members were deceased. Search continues . Taking advantage of better weather, the surface search area has been extended to the east, Marsdya Bambang Sulistyo, head of the Indonesian Search and Rescue agency, told reporters Sunday. Although there has been an improvement in conditions, they remain difficult, with heavy rain and high waves continuing to hamper recovery efforts. The surface search's extension was based on predictions that the remains of the victims, along with wreckage from the aircraft, have drifted with the current. The priority surface and underwater search areas remained the same, he added. Twenty aircraft and 27 ships were involved in Sunday's search. Divers are on standby but the underwater search was halted due to poor visibility and strong currents. Three more bodies -- still wearing seat belts -- were spotted on Friday, an Indonesian marine corps major, Professor De Greatsman, said. Search teams have found several large pieces of debris believed to be parts of the aircraft. Sulistyo said the latest objects --  including one that is 18 meters long -- were located by sonar in the priority search area. Searchers came upon the metal parts after spotting an oil slick late Friday. Who was on the plane . Sinking bodies . Anton Castilani, head of the Disaster Victims Identification unit, is eager to get the rest of the victims out of the water before they sink to the bottom of the sea. He is in charge of identifying them and said that gases in the bodies that keep them afloat disperse after a few days in the water. He urged families to be patient with his team as they identify loved ones. He wants to do his work right. ""We have to make sure that we have to return that right body to the right family,"" he said. Decomposition also slows his work down. ""The later the dead bodies come to you, the harder you work,"" he said. His team uses fingerprints and dental records as well as DNA to find out who they have recovered. • Hayati Lutfiah Hamid . • Grayson Herbert Linaksita . • Kevin Alexander Soetjipto . • The Meiji Thejakusuma . • Hendra Gunawan Syawal . • Khairunisa Haidar Fauzi . • Jie Stevie Gunawan . • Juanita Limantara . • Wismoyo Ari Prambudi . • Tony Linaksita . • Shiane Josal . • Lim Yan Koen . • Yongki Jou . • Indra Yulianto . • Hindarto Halim . • Jou Brian Youvito . Recoveries, identifications . On Friday, the USS Sampson, which the U.S. Navy has deployed to help, recovered some bodies. A limited number of them will be autopsied to determine the cause of death to aid the investigation, an Indonesian official said Saturday. But many families don't want autopsies done. ""For the sake of the investigation, we agree, and it is accepted by Interpol, to perform autopsies on the pilot, co-pilot and some randomly selected passengers,"" said East Java Police Chief Anas Yusuf. Nine of the plane's victims have been identified with the addition of the three victims' names on Sunday. Search priorities . Finding the fuselage and flight data recorders of the Airbus A320-200 has priority for the 59 diving teams searching underneath the waves. Russia has joined the effort with 22 underwater teams along with a search plane and a cargo jet. The searchers are concentrating on a 1,575-square-nautical-mile zone that officials believe is the most probable area to find the remains of the aircraft. Anguish revisited: Relatives of MH370 victims speak . Here's where things stand on Flight QZ8501: . The flight . What we know: QZ8501 took off early December 28 from Surabaya, bound for Singapore. Roughly 35 minutes into the flight, the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to avoid bad weather. Minutes later, the plane disappeared from air traffic control's radar. What we don't know: What happened on board after contact with the plane was lost. No distress call was received. Some experts speculate that the aircraft experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift. Other theories include a lack of information about the plane's position or storm damage to the engines. How can a modern airliner vanish? The investigation . What we know: The ""black boxes"" are key. Actually, the flight data recorders are orange and should be in the plane's tail. A lab in Jakarta will analyze them, if they are recovered. The batteries powering the ""pingers"" that send acoustic signals have only about three weeks of power left. What we don't know: What destroyed the plane. Investigators will need to use information gleaned from the flight recorders and clues from the wreckage to try to find out. ""The more bits I can put into my mosaic, the better my picture will be,"" aviation safety expert Michael Barr said. The ones who missed the flight . The plane and the pilots . What we know: The Airbus, operated by AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate, had accumulated about 23,000 flight hours in about 13,600 flights in six years. The plane's last scheduled maintenance was November 16. Flight 8501's veteran captain, Iriyanto, 53, had 20,537 flying hours, 6,100 of them with AirAsia on the Airbus A320, the airline said. The first officer, Remi Emmanuel Plesel, 46, had 2,275 flying hours, a reasonable amount for his position. Indonesian authorities are looking into why AirAsia was flying that particular route on that particular day, a Sunday; the country's Transport Ministry says that AirAsia was permitted to fly it only on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. AirAsia said it will cooperate with the inquiry and suspended all service from Surabaya to Singapore in the meantime. What we don't know: Did technical problems or human error have anything to do with the crash? A major aviation database registers 54 incidents involving the A320. Some A320 accidents and incidents involve fan-cowl detachments, landing gear collapse, bird strikes and pilot error, an expert said. These cause disasters only in very rare cases. Security threat? Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta issued a security alert Saturday after being ""made aware of a potential threat against U.S.-associated hotels and banks in Surabaya."" A State Department official, however, told CNN that there was ""no knowledge of any connection between ‎this threat and the AirAsia flight."" No additional information was given regarding the nature of the threat, but the embassy recommended ""heightened vigilance and awareness of one's surroundings when visiting such facilities."" CNN's Paula Hancocks, Elizabeth Joseph, Mitra Mobasherat, Gary Tuchman, Kevin Bohn and Joseph Netto contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- [SPOILER WARNING: If you didn't see the premiere of ""The Flash,"" you may not want to read any further.] . Speedy hero Barry Allen -- a.k.a. the Flash -- zoomed back onto TV Tuesday night. The CW unveiled its highly anticipated new fall series about the Scarlet Speedster, reviving the story of how scientist Barry Allen came to be the uberswift superhero after being hit by lightning and doused with chemicals. The freshman series, which stars Grant Gustin (""Glee"") as the endearing lead, was introduced through the CW's other comics-inspired series, ""Arrow."" With that program in its third season, the CW surely hopes to find another success story with ""The Flash."" Comic books invade the small screen . So far, the network's off to a great start. ""The Flash"" is The CW's highest-rated and most-watched series premiere since 2009, with 4.5 million viewers and a rating of 1.8 in the adult demo of 18-49 -- not to mention that critics were also willing to give it a shot. ""The CW's 'The Flash' is one of the most enjoyable, agreeable and infectiously exuberant new shows of the fall,"" applauded TV Guide, and USA Today's Robert Bianco predicted that ""The Flash"" could follow in ""Arrow's"" longevity footsteps if it ""can maintain the quality of the plot."" Besides, Bianco added, ""How nice to see a superhero who counts optimism among his powers."" Alan Sepinwall praised the show's lighter tone at Hitfix.com: ""Gustin â€” well-scrubbed, dimpled and forthright â€” tacks right into the fundamental good-natured decency of Barry and makes that into an asset."" That said, the last time ""the fastest man alive"" was on TV, it didn't work out so well. In 1990, it was John Wesley Shipp who wore the iconic red suit and raced around alongside co-stars Amanda Pays and Alex Desert. But that series was canceled after a single season. Shipp is getting a second chance at seeing the Flash find a home on TV in his role as Barry Allen's father in the CW's new version. According to ""The Flash"" actress Candice Patton, who plays Barry's love interest, Iris, everyone from the executive production team on down is ""very aware of the love for Flash."" ""Our series feels and looks like the comic book in a lot of ways,"" Patton said. ""The design is so incredible."" Tuesday's premiere saw the Flash facing off against his very first supervillain, the Weather Wizard. (Future episodes will feature more comic book villains like Captain Cold and heroes like Firestorm.) But what caught our attention the most was that surprising ending. Why is wheelchair-bound S.T.A.R. Labs boss Harrison Wells looking at a hologram of a 2024 newspaper that carries the headline, ""Flash missing: Vanishes in crisis""? (That's a reference to the 1980s ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" comic, where Barry died.) Plus, what really happened to Barry's mother when she died? And when will Barry's longtime friend/crush Iris learn the truth about her longtime friend? We're definitely on board to find out the truth about these mysteries. Twitter users tended to agree: Neale Bastiaans wrote, ""Really enjoyed #TheFlashpremiere tonight. Off to a great start. @grantgust seems like a lead you can build a series around."" @Miranda_Blu adored the show as well. ""#TheFlashpremiere was the best new show premier I've seen in a long time!"" Echoing many critics was John Gholson. ""#TheFlashpremiere was better than most TV superhero 1st episodes, thanks to embracing its comic roots & a generally upbeat vibe,"" he said. We'll see if the positive reactions continue. So far, so good for the Scarlet Speedster. So what can fans look forward to next? Executive producer Andrew Kreisberg told us about the villains and heroes we'll meet this season. ""We've got Captain Cold in Episode 4; Plastique; in Episode 7 we have Blackout; and in Episode 8 we've got our big crossover with Arrow. We're really looking forward to that.""

"(CNN)Mention of Dubai usually prompts images of tall buildings, pristine beaches and luxurious hotels. Not graffiti, that's for sure. So it seems an anomaly, perhaps, that the city should be host to the first gallery in the UAE, and possibly the Middle East, dedicated to the art of the spray can. Not so says Thomas Perreaux-Forest, partner in the groundbreaking venture, Street Art Gallery, in one of Dubai's more salubrious suburbs. The Frenchman -- smart, handsome, well educated -- is, in some ways, an unlikely champion of such a polarizing genre. He's the kind of upstanding citizen you might expect to revile youths armed with spray cans. He says the art form goes way beyond graffiti, however. His gallery in Dubai's Jumeirah neighborhood appears to support his theory, offering spray-painted works an unlikely home in a country largely devoid of graffiti -- and attracting healthy prices. Work at recent exhibitions has been fetching up to and upward of $10,000. Shared passion . At any one time there are about 100 pieces on show with exhibitions changing at least once a month. Perreaux-Forest, 43, and fellow founder and curator Stephane Valici, 45, knew there would be demand after their shared passion for street art led them to a surprising discovery in the United States. ""We realized when we were going to gallery openings here in Dubai that we couldn't really see what we enjoyed and when we found it, it was quite overpriced,"" says Perreaux-Forest. ""Then we were talking to galleries in Miami and New York and France and those guys were telling us that people from Dubai came over there to buy artworks. ""This made us think: 'Why not open a gallery ... people who are interested in this cross the Atlantic so it proves there is demand.' ""It was still a gamble because it is hard to do a market study, but the feedback as soon as we opened was absolutely amazing."" First show, ""Wynwood Goes Dubai,"" celebrated a Miami district where street artists are free to spray-paint without hassle from police. ""It's a very creative place. There's a big street artist community there and during our last trip we met lots of artists and signed 10, male and female, from Miami, some from New York and LA. That exhibition was a sneak preview of their work."" The gallery's third exhibition, ""Be The Change,"" was certainly a departure from what Dubai's healthy, but largely commercial art scene was used to. It celebrated some of the more brash examples of street art and graffiti, with some work examining public protest. Again, not something the UAE experiences too often. Incendiary inspiration . Before long, big international names in the genre were getting involved. Parisian veteran Nasty brought signs and wall tiles from the French capital's metro, decorated in his inimitable style. ""Nasty is very experienced and well known and began in the '80s by tagging trains,"" says Perreaux-Forest. ""He has just had an exhibition in Hong Kong."" Fellow French street star OneMizer -- who does everything from portraits to comic-style work -- flew in, as did Geneva-based mural specialist Bandi, who also comes from France but has created futuristic work inspired by Dubai. Swiss-born, and now Dubai-based, JustOne brought possibly the most controversial work, inspired by incendiary street protest, in addition to a decorated chunk of wall that he has on permanent display in the gallery. By contrast, the gallery recently curated a special exhibition to compliment the holy month of Ramadan. ""Calligraffiti"" matched street art with Arabic writing, given a modern twist by local talent. ""We took the opportunity of Ramadan to do something about the art of writing,"" adds Perreaux-Forest. ""Here in the region, Arab calligraphy is very important and is a real art form in itself. There is an evolution in this particular art. ""On the other side the graffiti started with lettering, guys signing or tagging streets or trains. So it was interesting to mix those arts of writing, the classical but modern calligraphy with the writing in graffiti, a mix of ancient and modern. ""And we managed to find some calligraphers that do much more modern pieces than we're used to seeing in galleries around the region. Some were very close to street art."" It proved an exciting glimpse into where Dubai could go with the genre and flushed out some indigenous potential. ""We would be very keen to display more local street artists,"" adds Perreaux-Forest, when asked whether he plans to showcase and nurture some of that native talent. Breaking down barriers . A few of those artists mingle and exchange ideas during the gallery's frequent and vibrant opening nights. ""For the moment we are focusing on established artists, but a bit of what we do is to help the local scene and raise the level,"" says Perreaux-Forest. ""It's good to visit a gallery to meet experienced artists, to improve your style and work, and that's what I believe is needed here. ""Street art is not allowed anywhere (in the UAE), but it can be tolerated in western countries. Here it is not really the case and we don't want graffiti all over the place. ""But one of our missions is to help the local guys and to make local culture and people from the region understand that street art is not about degradation and that there are many different styles in street art."" For now, Street Art Gallery is opening its walls to the likes of Jenni Perez, Godzilla, Hep and One Love and is plotting a busy 2015 as its own exterior white walls are gradually replaced by visiting artists spraying what they think of Dubai's new art hotspot. Street Art Gallery is currently hosting one of the first and most infamous graffiti writers of the South Florida movement. Miami's Hec One Love is showcasing more than 100 of his works in Dubai under the banner ""Loveism"" until December 10. The artist is known for his massive walls and post-graffitism abstracts and the Dubai show represents his biggest publicly displayed collection yet.

"On Monday, Pakistan's long-awaited report into the death of Osama bin Laden in the city of Abbottabad two years ago was leaked in full to Al Jazeera. The independent Abbottabad Commission was established by Pakistan's parliament to investigate what for many Pakistanis was an embarrassing double national humiliation. First, that bin Laden lived in Pakistan for nine years undetected before he was killed. Second, that the U.S. conducted a military operation inside Pakistan that, from the moment that four U.S. helicopters penetrated Pakistan's airspace, lasted for more than three hours without detection by the Pakistani military. In more than 300 pages, the report paints an intimate picture of the final days and years of the leader of al Qaeda and is also a devastating indictment of what it describes as the incompetence of many institutions of the Pakistani state. A senior Pakistani government official told CNN the Abbottabad Commission report is authentic. Report: Osama bin Laden -- doting grandpa, paranoid terrorist . The night of the raid . The report describes the ""fateful night"" of May 2, 2011, when bin Laden was killed by a U.S. Navy SEAL team and begins with a flourish out of a Harlequin romance: ""Today was Amal's turn for the Shaikh [bin Laden] to be with her. She was the youngest of his wives."" The report goes on to describe in almost minute-by-minute detail the SEAL raid on the bin Laden compound in Abbottabad, which, it estimates, took between 36 and 38 minutes. Bin Laden and Amal were sleeping in their top floor bedroom with their 3-year-old son Hussain when they were startled awake by a noise that sounded like a ""a storm,"" the report recounts. Amal reached to turn on the light in the bedroom but bin Laden told her: ""No!"" Soon bin Laden and his young wife were joined by two of bin Laden's adult daughters. Together they quickly recited verses of the Koran and bin Laden informed them that American helicopters had arrived. He ordered his children to leave his bedroom. Suddenly, an American soldier appeared in the room. Amal saw a red beam of light from the laser of the soldier's gun but she heard no sounds, as the weapon had a silencer. Amal rushed the soldier who shot her ""in the knee,"" the report says. A shot from the U.S .soldier hit bin Laden in the head and he died at around 12:50 a.m. on May 2, 2011, according to the report. The report -- by four retired senior Pakistani military, diplomatic, police and judicial officials -- is based on 201 interviews of government officials and other witnesses. Bin Laden's death: How the story unfolded . An obsession with security . Bin Laden went to great lengths to avoid detection, according to the report's description. When he left his three-story residence to tour his Abbottabad compound, he wore a cowboy hat that prevented prying eyes or satellites from recognizing him. Bin Laden's two bodyguards also practiced careful operational security, making phone calls from public call booths in cities at least an hour's drive from the Abbottabad compound, where they lived with al Qaeda's leader. When one of the bodyguard's young daughters saw a picture of bin Laden on a television program and recognized him to be the tall Arab man who was living on the Abbottabad compound, the report says, the bodyguard banned any further TV watching and any subsequent contact between his family and the bin Laden family. After the arrest of 9/11 operational commander Khalid Sheik Mohammed in Pakistan in March 2003, bin Laden decided to stop meeting with any al Qaeda members in person, with the exception of his two bodyguards. During bin Laden's nine years on the run, his wife Amal gave birth to four children in Pakistan. To avoid any troublesome questions, when Amal gave birth in a hospital the nurses and doctors were informed that she was ""deaf and dumb."" The bin Laden bodyguards installed four separate gas and electricity meters at the Abbottabad compound to ensure that there wasn't ever a suspiciously large gas or electricity bill betraying the presence of the 16 members of the bin Laden family. Despite bin Laden complaints of pains in his heart or kidney he never saw a doctor, preferring to treat these ailments with ""traditional Arab medicine,"" the report says. When bin Laden traveled around Pakistan, which he did relatively frequently in the early years of his life on the run, he shaved off his distinctive beard. Opinion: From bin Laden to Boston . The Family Man . The report shows bin Laden to be an involved father and grandfather to the dozen or so of his children and grandchildren who were living at the Abbottabad compound. He supervised their playtime, which included cultivating vegetable plots and he handed out ""prizes for best performance."" Bin Laden was also strict when it came to his Islamic beliefs. In the bin Laden family, girls were completely separated from males at the unusually early age of three. And even when men appeared on TV, the bin Laden women would leave the room. For the scion of one of the richest families in the Middle East, bin Laden certainly was careful with money. He had only a few changes of clothes and was paying the two bodyguards who were his only connection to the outside world around $100 a month each, according to the report. The CIA . The Abbottabad commission also examined the recruitment of Pakistani doctor Shakeel Afridi, who, according to the commissioners, was paid 10 million rupees by the CIA -- around $100,000 -- to mount a hepatitis-B vaccination program in Abbottabad. The aim was to confirm the presence of bin Laden at his suspected hideout by extracting blood samples from his children.   The CIA hoped to compare that DNA  to DNA the U.S. government had already obtained from other members of the bin Laden family. Afridi met with CIA officials on a number of occasions, including with two female operatives named ""Kate"" and ""Sue,"" who posed as officials with the U.S. Agency for International Development.  Dr. Afridi's CIA handlers provided him with a satellite radio so they could stay in touch with him and easily track him. Two weeks before bin Laden was killed, Dr. Afridi arrived outside the bin Laden compound. He called one of bin Laden's bodyguards on the phone seeking entry, but the bodyguard told him there that no one was at home. The CIA plans to extract blood samples from the bin Laden kids never panned out. Afridi is now serving a 33-year prison term in Pakistan for what the independent report characterizes as the ""trumped-up charges"" of providing support to the Taliban. Opinion: Who really killed bin Laden? Pakistani government failures . The report found that the at the time of the raid on bin Laden's compound, the Pakistani Air Force was focused on its traditional Indian enemy on its eastern border and its radar systems were in ""peacetime mode"" on its western border with Afghanistan. This helped explain how the U.S. was able to insert four helicopters into Pakistan without detection. When the Pakistani Air Force finally scrambled jets to intercept the American helicopters they were long gone from Abbottabad. The report faults local officials in Abbottabad for their ""collective incompetence and negligence"" for not paying more attention to the mysterious compound where bin Laden was hiding out. And it faults Pakistan's intelligence agencies for not mounting any kind of serious effort to discover if bin Laden was living in Pakistan. The report also lambastes the same intelligence agencies for not detecting the ""nationwide CIA network"" in Pakistan. On two occasions the report makes reference to bin Laden's ""diary"" which was recovered at the Abbottabad compound. Hopefully, the U.S. or Pakistani government will at some point make public the contents of that diary, which will doubtless provide important new insights about the life and thinking of al-Qaeda's founder.","Peter Bergen: Abbottabad Report gives intimate picture of bin Laden's life hiding in Pakistan .

"(CNN) -- A United States soldier captured by the Taliban says in a video posted on the Internet he is ""scared I won't be able to go home."" Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl shown here in a video made by his captors, members of the Taliban. The soldier was identified Sunday by the Pentagon as Pfc. Bowe R. Bergdahl, 23, of Ketchum, Idaho. He was captured June 30 from Paktika province in southeastern Afghanistan. The Taliban has threatened to kill Bergdahl if foreign troops continue targeting civilians in the name of search operations in Ghazni and Paktika province, Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said by telephone Friday after being contacted by CNN at an undisclosed location. NATO-led forces in Afghanistan and the U.S. military have repeatedly denied targeting civilians. In the 28-minute video, Bergdahl becomes emotional when he speaks of his family -- his parents, siblings, nieces and nephew -- and the girlfriend he hopes to marry. ""I have a very, very good family that I love back home in America, and I miss them every day that I'm gone,"" he says. ""I miss them and I'm afraid I might never see them again and that I'll never be able to tell them I love them again. I'll never be able to hug them."" He adds that he is ""scared. I'm scared I won't be able to go home. It is very unnerving to be a prisoner."" However, he says his captors are treating him ""like a guest."" It was not clear whether some or all of Bergdahl's remarks were scripted by his captors.  Watch excerpt from the video » . The last few minutes of the video show him eating a meal. In a statement released Sunday through the Idaho National Guard, Bergdahl's family said, ""We hope and pray for our son's safe return to his comrades and then to our family, and we appreciate all the support and expressions of sympathy shown to us by our family members, our friends and others across the nation. Thank you, and please continue to keep Bowe in your thoughts and prayers."" Asked by his captors if he had any message for Americans, the soldier says, ""To my fellow Americans who have loved ones over here, who know what it's like to miss them, you have the power to make our government bring them home. Please, please bring us home so we can be back where we belong and not over here."" The Taliban earlier claimed responsibility for Bergdahl's kidnapping, the military said. Last week, the U.S. military distributed pamphlets in eastern Afghanistan in an effort to locate him. ""As you can see, the American soldier is in good shape and good health, and he is being treated well based on the guidelines of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan regarding war prisoners,"" said a statement on Islamist Web sites accompanying the video. ""Any decision regarding the American soldier will be the specialty of the high order of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, may God protect him."" The U.S. military said it believed Bergdahl may have been moved to various locations. In the video, Bergdahl's captor makes reference to his being moved from Paktika to Khandahar. He acknowledges it, saying the move was accomplished ""very easily."" The claim could not be independently verified. Asked the date by his captor, Bergdahl says it is July 14. Two versions of the pamphlets were distributed in Afghanistan, written in the Pashto language. They were made available to CNN by U.S. Forces Afghanistan. One shows the image of an American soldier shaking hands in a group of kids with the message, ""One of our American guests is missing. Return the guest to his home. Call us at"" -- and lists a phone number. The other shows a U.S. soldier kicking down a door, and then an outstretched hand with the superimposed image of a soldier, his head and arms drooping, and the words, ""If you do not release the U.S. soldier then ... you will be hunted,"" the pamphlet says. Days after Bergdahl went missing, a senior U.S. military official said Bergdahl and the Afghan soldiers were captured by low-level militants and then quickly ""sold"" to the clan and network led by warlord Siraj Haqqani -- believed to be deeply involved in the action. The Haqqani clan operates on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistani border and is well known to the U.S. military. Bergdahl apparently left his small outpost on his own on June 30 with no apparent means of defending himself, the official said. Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said he visited a military post in the Yousaf Khel district in the Paktika province, got drunk, and was ambushed while returning to his car. Sangeen said the soldier was taken to a safe place. CNN could not independently verify Sangeen's claims. A source with the U.S. military denied the claim that Bergdahl was drunk. ""The Taliban are known for lying and what they are claiming (is) not true,"" the source said. In the video, Bergdahl says he was captured as he was lagging behind a patrol. Ketchum Mayor Randy Hall told CNN Sunday, ""Right now, the news is still breaking through town, and as the mayor, I can say this is a community situation."" But, he said, ""I trust the leadership of this country, the wisdom of the people who are serving and the decisions that led up to the situation."" Bergdahl is not a National Guardsman, according to the Idaho National Guard statement, but the organization said it was coordinating with the Department of Defense to provide public affairs duties and other assistance to the Bergdahl family. The family has requested privacy, the statement said. CNN's Barbara Starr and journalist Janullah Hashimzada contributed to this report.","Soldier from Idaho says he's frightened he won't be able to see family again .

"What would you do if you went to the library in search of ""The Adventures of Captain Underpants"" for your child, or to re-read Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ""Beloved"" only to find that the book had been pulled from the shelves because another patron objected to its content? It happens in the United States more often than many realize. At least 464 formal complaints were filed in 2012 seeking to remove books from libraries or schools, according to the American Library Association, a sponsor of Banned Books Week, which runs September 22-28. Its mission is to celebrate the freedom to read and highlight the pitfalls of censorship. Modern children's books help families explore diversity . The annual event started in 1982, the same year the Supreme Court ruled that students' First Amendment rights were violated when Kurt Vonnegut's ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" and eight other books were removed from school libraries. Despite the legal precedent, schools and libraries still receive formal challenges to remove books from library shelves or nix them from reading lists to protect children from material some see as inappropriate. Just this month, a North Carolina school board voted to ban Ralph Ellison's ""Invisible Man"" based on complaints from the parent of an 11th-grader. The board is reportedly scheduled to reconsider its decision. The targets of challenges have changed over the years, but the reasons remain fairly constant, said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, the ALA's deputy director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom. ""Sexually explicit content and offensive language continue to be the main reasons,"" she said. The Office for Intellectual Freedom compiles lists of attempts to ban books in libraries and schools based on media reports and reports filed directly with the office, which means it documents only the complaints brought to its attention. For each challenge recorded, the ALA estimates there are four to five more that go unreported. For similar reasons it's also hard to pin down exactly how many challenges succeed. A book might be pulled without the public's knowledge, or a ban might be overturned when appealed by teachers, parents and students. Books from Dav Pilkey's ""Captain Underpants"" series, which chronicles the adventures of two fourth-grade pranksters, were the most frequently challenged books in 2012, along with acclaimed bestsellers ""Beloved,"" by Toni Morrison, ""The Kite Runner"" by Khaled Hosseini and ""Looking for Alaska"" by John Green. 'Bluebird': A boy, a bird and bullies . Most of the titles were making repeat appearances at the top of the list, owing to what Caldwell-Stone calls the""viral"" nature of book challenges: A book is the target of a ban in one community, then someone from another community hears about it and makes his or her own challenge. So what do authors do when their books are targeted? We spoke to two authors whose books made the most-challenged list in 2012. A children's book 'we could stand behind' Justin Richardson is the co-author of ""And Tango Makes Three,"" a children's book about Roy and Silo, a pair of male penguins who successfully hatched an egg at New York's Central Park Zoo. ""And Tango Makes Three"" was the fifth most frequently challenged book in 2012, the ALA reported. On whether Richardson thought ""And Tango Makes Three"" would be controversial: . ""We did anticipate that there would be objections from some corners to our book. We never anticipated that we would become [one of] the most challenged book five years in a row."" On how it changed the way they wrote the book: . ""It encouraged us to write a book that we could stand behind. We chose our words very carefully in writing this book, and in part we chose them carefully because we knew there was a possibility that it would be challenged . ""For example, there's no anthropomorphisation in the book, we never said Roy felt a certain way because we did not want to attribute anything to the penguins in the order of a human intention because that's something that could very easily be criticized, and fairly so, as reading our own agenda into the penguins' actions. That was one way the book was shaped in anticipation of criticism. ""At the same time, you don't write books for critics, you write it for people who will benefit from it and enjoy it. Ultimately there will be many more of those people than critics. We were writing for young children who had families like those in the book. We also felt it was important to have our facts straight because one of the points people defending the book observed is that this is actually a true story. We visited the penguins and interviewed zookeepers and vetted it with Central Park Zoo to make sure we weren't misstating the true events."" On how he and his co-author responded to attempts to ban the book: . ""Every challenge is different. The first challenge that we heard of was the most disturbing, and that was because of the way it was handled. ""A librarian had received a challenge about the book, and her response was to take the book out of the fiction section and place it into the nonfiction section because that section was much less frequently browsed. Naturally, we were extremely displeased and wrote a letter of complaint to the newsletter of the American Library Association. ""Very shortly after that, or maybe as result of that event, librarians across the country and organizations who saw it as their charter to defend books got on the issue, and we were lucky to be championed by them, including the ALA, the Office for Intellectual Freedom, Pen American Center, and numerous local affiliates of the ACLU. When you know you have those organizations behind you and the United States Constitution in your corner, all of those challenges become less upsetting. ""We've dealt with them in a number of different ways, but our preference is to let organizations and folks on the ground in the community to do their work so there's a local solution to the challenge. It's far better than having two New York authors call up a town and say 'Hey you're violating the United States Constitution.' We'd rather have a group of parents go to a board meeting and work this out. However, when a librarian has worked particularly courageously we'll send an e-mail to support her. ""We've written school board members and let them know that there is a precedent and Supreme Court ruling on the subject. In each case where there's an open challenge, a school will go through the process where they appoint a committee or take it to the school board to investigate what the actions should be. You could look at them negatively and say there's a certain amount of reinventing the wheel because the legal precedent is quite clear. At the same time, allowing the school community to go through the process of figuring that out and debating it I think has an unquestionable value, and that's one reason we like to leave it to them."" On how it affected his views on censorship: . ""It's strengthened my appreciation for the importance of protecting the freedom to read. ""I think we handle [public challenges] to books pretty well as a country. But I think there's a greater problem which is secret challenges to books and soft bans; when a school official objects to a book and checks it out and fails to return it, or when a school librarian reads news about a particular book and is afraid to order it for the library. That self-censorship is something that I don't believe we have an answer to."" A novel that 'needed to feel uncomfortable' Jay Asher is the author of ""Thirteen Reasons Why,"" a young adult novel about a teen who commits suicide and leaves behind audio recordings sharing 13 reasons she decided to end her life. ""Thirteen Reasons Why"" was the third most-challenged book in 2012, according to the ALA. On whether Asher thought ""Thirteen Reasons Why"" would be controversial: . ""I was writing a book about issues that make most people uncomfortable, including me. That alone, I knew, could make it controversial. But these are issues people do experience. To emotionally reach people, I had to write my story honestly. But I also wanted the book to be available to as many people as possible, so I did write a slightly less-graphic alternate versioan of one scene. I let my publisher decide which to publish, and they correctly chose the more intense scene because readers needed to feel uncomfortable there to understand what the character was going through."" On how he responded to attempts to ban the book: . ""The times I've heard about challenges, there have been people in those communities defending my book. In one, there was a school board meeting to decide whether to remove my book from the library, and a parent read aloud one scene without context. It took a student at the school, stepping up to the microphone, to teach those adults about context. As a result, the book remained in the school. Other times, principals have concerns about my book being used in the classroom, and a teacher will contact me to see what I can do to help the principal make a decision. I send them e-mails from readers expressing what they gained from reading the book. I know why I wrote my book, and I know what readers are getting from it. I would have no problem attending a meeting if I thought it would help the decision makers be less afraid."" On how it affected his views on censorship: . ""Having spoken to thousands of teens since my book came out, I even more firmly believe that books dealing with these issues need to be written as emotionally honest as possible. Not only is it appropriate, it's responsible. If people are dealing with it, we need to talk about it. Otherwise, we contribute to the main reason people don't reach out for help. I consistently hear readers say my book was the first time they felt understood, which is sad. I'm sure many people around them would understand. If my book proves that there are people who get what they're going through, I'm honored. The very day I found out 'Thirteen Reasons Why' was the third most-challenged book, I received an e-mail from a reader claiming my book kept her from committing suicide. I dare any censor to tell that girl it was inappropriate for her to read my book. ""If a parent feels their child shouldn't read a book, that's their prerogative.""","""The Kite Runner,"" ""Beloved,"" ""Looking for Alaska"" among most frequently challenged .

"Mickey Rooney, whose roller-coaster, nine-decade career in show business included vaudeville, silent films, movies, television and Broadway, died Sunday. He was 93. Rooney died in California, the Los Angeles County Coroner's office said. Rooney's career spanned almost the entire history of motion pictures. He made his first film, the silent ""Not to Be Trusted,"" in 1926 and followed it up with several shorts based on the ""Mickey McGuire"" comic strip. He was still making movies nine decades later, including ""Night at the Museum"" (2006) and ""The Muppets"" (2011). At the time of his death, he had three more films in the works, according to the Internet Movie Database, including a version of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" with Margaret O'Brien. Rooney had just completed his last movie role in the next installment of ""Night at the Museum"" with Ben Stiller. ""He led a full life but did not have enough time to finish all he had planned to do. He had the time of his life and the utmost respect for the cast and crew,"" his son Mark Rooney said in a statement to CNN Monday. He separated from his wife, Jan Chamberlin, two years ago and moved in with his son and his wife, Charlene, according to the statement.  ""With them he finally found happiness, health and a feeling of safety and was able to enjoy life again."" ""Mickey was finally enjoying life as a bachelor, and the morning of his death, they spoke of all their future plans,"" the statement said. ""He loved the business he was in and had a great respect for his fellow actors."" For a period in the 1930s and 1940s, boosted by the popularity of the ""Andy Hardy"" series of films, Rooney was the No. 1 star at the box office and perhaps the brightest star at MGM -- a whole studio of ""more stars than there are in heaven,"" as the publicity said. Yet he became as famous for many marriages -- eight, all told -- and his regular tumbles off the Hollywood pedestal as he was for his incredible energy and longevity. Still, he never stopped getting up. ""I keep going because if you stop, you stop,"" he told the UK's Guardian newspaper in 2009. ""Why retire? Inspire."" Top box-office draw . The diminutive 5-foot, 2-inch Rooney began his acting career shortly after his first birthday, appearing on vaudeville stages with his parents. He was born Joseph Yule Jr. on September 23, 1920, in Brooklyn, New York. His parents split when he was young, but spurred by his mother, he soon found himself in Hollywood. Before he was 10, he was a star, appearing in dozens of shorts based on the popular ""Mickey McGuire"" strip. He worked steadily through the 1930s, with notable turns in a 1935 version of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" and 1937's ""Captains Courageous,"" the latter opposite Spencer Tracy. (Rooney also appeared in Tracy's 1938 vehicle ""Boys Town."") But he shot into Hollywood's stratosphere in his next film series as Andy Hardy in more than a dozen films produced between 1937 and 1946. Andy Hardy was a good-hearted ball of teenage mischief, always trying to make a few dollars or willing to ""put on a show,"" no matter what it took: rounding up friends, using a barn, getting some spare parts from his wholesome middle-American neighborhood. Inevitably, he would be called to account with his father, Judge Hardy, played at first by Lionel Barrymore and later by Lewis Stone. Judge Hardy would reiterate the basics of fairness and morality, and Andy -- and the movie audience -- would have once again learned a valuable lesson. The films were hugely popular, even more so when Rooney's character became the centerpiece starting with 1938's ""Love Finds Andy Hardy."" It didn't hurt that Rooney was paired with Judy Garland for three of the films. Garland and Rooney also co-starred in several Busby Berkeley musicals, including 1940's ""Strike up the Band"" and ""Babes on Broadway"" a year later. Many marriages, money troubles . But Rooney's private life wasn't always as wonderful as his on-screen persona would indicate. He was married eight times, three times in the 1940s alone. His first marriage, to Ava Gardner, began in 1942 and ended in 1943. In 1944, he married an Alabama beauty queen, Betty Jane Phillips; that one ended in 1948. His third marriage, to Martha Vickers, lasted less than three years. Throughout, Rooney was known as a spendthrift and a challenging partner. He loved horseracing and routinely spent his earnings at the track, even when there weren't many earnings to speak of, as there was during a fallow period in the 1950s. As an adult of a certain size, Rooney found it much harder to find roles into which he could channel his prodigious talents. But he wouldn't stay unemployed for long. There was a TV series, ""The Mickey Rooney Show,"" for a season in 1954-55. More important, there was a supporting actor Oscar nomination for 1956's ""The Bold and the Brave."" Rooney, however, wasn't very discriminating about his roles. Other films during the late '50s and early '60s included forgettable flicks such as ""Operation Mad Ball"" (1957), ""The Private Lives of Adam and Eve"" (1960) and ""Platinum High School"" (1960). He appeared in the classic ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" (1961) but in the unfortunate, broadly acted role of Holly Golightly's Japanese neighbor, Mr. Yunioshi. He was one of the cast of a thousand comedians in ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" (1963). Rooney also made TV guest appearances on such shows as ""The Investigators,"" ""Naked City"" and ""The Twilight Zone."" On the latter, he played a jockey. 'He is a showman' After another 15 years of minor movie parts and TV roles, Rooney's up-and-down career once again hit the heights. He earned an Oscar nomination for his performance as a horse trainer in 1979's ""The Black Stallion"" and dazzled Broadway in the song-and-dance revue ""Sugar Babies"" -- a role, given his start, he was born to play. The show earned him a Tony nomination and ran for almost three years. Over the years, Rooney earned four Oscar nominations. In addition, he received a special Oscar  in 1939 and an honorary one in 1983. Rooney also triumphed on television in the 1981 TV movie ""Bill,"" about a mentally disabled man trying to live on his own. That performance garnered him an Emmy. Video: Interview with Rooney in March . He also found a lasting marriage when he wed Jan Chamberlin in 1978. Chamberlin survives the actor. However, Rooney once again faced financial struggles as he entered his later decades. They came to national attention when he asked a Los Angeles court to appoint a conservator to protect him from his stepson and stepdaughter. Rooney blamed his financial troubles on a stepson whom he successfully sued. He also took his case to Congress, delivering emotional testimony to a House committee in March 2011 in which he said family members took control of his life, making him ""scared, disappointed, yes, and angry."" Rooney made his audience laugh and cry when he implored senators to stop what experts call chronic emotional, physical, sexual and financial abuse of elderly Americans by family members and other caregivers. Rooney called on Congress to make elder abuse a specific crime. ""I'm asking you to stop this elderly abuse. I mean to stop it. Now. Not tomorrow, not next month but now,"" he shouted from the witness table. Rooney: A spokesman against elder abuse . Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Reva Goetz appointed attorney Michael Augustine as Rooney's permanent conservator that month. Augustine immediately began seeking entertainment gigs for the aging performer, telling CNN that he had to revive his show business career quickly or would die ""in very short order."" Augustine summed up Rooney's drive in a few sentences. ""Mr. Rooney's parents put him on the vaudeville stage when he was 17 months old,"" he said in 2011. ""If Mr. Rooney were to not work, I think we would be attending Mr. Rooney's funeral in very short order. ""It's part of his fiber,"" Augustine continued. ""He loves it. He is a showman."" His last months included reunions with old friends, the family statement said. ""Even someone of Mickey's iconic statue was quite star struck and was extremely thrilled to attend Vanity Fair's Oscar party recently,"" the family said.  ""Just last week Mickey was ecstatic when they surprised him by reuniting him with one of his great loves, the race track. There they spent time with Mel Brooks and Dick Van Patten. He had exceptional care and a new lease on life."" People we lost in 2014 .","Mickey Rooney just finished work on ""Night at the Museum 3""

"(CNN)Hundreds of Islamist militants have seized a multinational military base in northeastern Nigeria, according to a government official. ""Boko Haram overwhelmed the Multinational Joint Task Force and dislodged them from their base outside Baga after hours-long fighting,"" said Maina Ma'aji Lawan, a Nigerian senator ‎from the state of Borno, where Baga is located. ""They came in huge numbers heavily armed and subdued the multinational troops consisting (of) soldiers from Nigeria, Niger and Chad,"" Lawan said. Villagers: Boko Haram abduct 40 boys, young men . The Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) was formed in 1998 to combat light arms proliferation and human trafficking. More recently, it has been involved in the fight against Boko Haram. It was not immediately clear how many troops were at the base at the time of the attack, which happened Saturday. Baga resident  Yusuf Maidaji fled to the Chadian village of Kangallam. He said the militants in Baga torched hundreds of homes and looted shops. He also said people were killed, but that it was difficult to know how many. ""The toll could be huge because the gunmen opened indiscriminate fire on fleeing residents,"" said Maidaji. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. The Islamist group -- considered one of the world's most deadly terrorist organizations -- has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.","Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009 .

"(CNN)Five men have been arrested in India over the alleged rape of a Japanese tourist, police in the city of Kolkata told CNN. The men allegedly operated as a gang, targeting single, female Japanese tourists. According to Pallab Kanti Ghosh, joint police commissioner in Kolkata, the victim, a 22 year-old from Saitama, Japan, was approached on November 20 of last year by a man who spoke Japanese ""very well,"" and convinced her to accompany him and a friend to a variety of tourist spots over the following days. Two suspects were arrested from near the Buddhist pilgrimage center of Gaya in neighboring Bihar state and charged with rape, the officer said. Three other men were arrested for criminal conspiracy. The arrests were made on January 1. ""The victim is cooperating with us in our investigation,"" he said. The victim told police that she had also been forced to remove money from her bank accounts, and that the men had also withdrawn money using her ATM card without her knowledge. The initial ""First Information Report (FIR)"" complaint filed with Kolkata police, obtained by CNN, focuses mainly on the extortion and theft of a sum of 76,000 rupees ($1,200) over several incidents. The charges were later amended to include rape. The FIR mentions molestation but does not contain accusations of rape, which were added to the victim's account during a subsequent appearance before a magistrate. Sexual assault is a high-profile problem in India, particularly following the fatal gang-rape of a student on a bus in New Delhi in 2012. Since then, a Swiss tourist was also gang-raped while on a cycling holiday in India, and the Uber taxi service banned in the Indian capital after a driver was accused of raping a female passenger.

"Calling it a ""good-faith effort"" to help the Egyptian people, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry released $250 million in economic aid Sunday, with a pledge of more if President Mohamed Morsy implements economic and political reforms. Kerry's announcement came after a series of weekend meetings in Cairo with a cross-section of Egyptians and a two-hour session with Morsy on Sunday. ""When Egypt takes the difficult steps to strengthen its economy and build political unity and justice, we will work with our Congress at home on additional support,"" Kerry said in a written statement on the talks. But right now, Kerry said, Egypt needs help. ""In light of Egypt's extreme needs"" and assurances by Morsy that he will take the steps necessary to obtain a major loan package from the International Monetary Fund, Kerry said the United States would provide the first $190 million of $450 million in already-promised support funds to the Egyptian government budget. In addition, Kerry said, the United States will provide $60 million in direct support for an Egyptian-American Enterprise Fund geared toward Egypt's entrepreneurs and fund a higher-education initiative to help students, especially women, earn undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and business. Kerry said he was banking on Morsy's assurances that he would implement ""homegrown"" reforms to help secure agreement with the IMF and ""put Egypt on the path to establishing a firm economic foundation and allow it to chart its own course."" Morsy ""agreed and said he plans to move quickly to do so,"" Kerry said. But Kerry is not releasing all of the $1 billion the Obama adminstration pledged to Egypt in May 2011, after the democratic revolution that toppled longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak. In addition to Sunday's $190 million, there is an additional $260 million in budget support funds still pending. And in a separate tranche of money, there is a further $550 million for scholarships and loan guarantees. Release of these funds will depend on Morsy's following through on political as well as economic steps. ""The brave Egyptians who stood vigil in Tahrir Square did not risk their lives to see that opportunity for a brighter future squandered,"" Kerry said. ""The Egyptian people must come together to address their economic challenge."" Egypt's heavily tourism-dependent economy went into a tailspin when the revolution began. The IMF has offered $4.8 billion in loans to help revive the country's economy, under conditions that Egypt overhaul its finances, cut energy subsidies, raise taxes and reduce its budget deficit. Kerry said Washington -- long Egypt's leading ally -- still has concerns about free and fair elections, human rights, police conduct, clampdowns on nongovernmental organizations and other problems that beset Egypt's troubled transition to democracy. ""It is clear that more hard work and compromise will be required to restore unity, political stability and economic health to Egypt,"" Kerry said. ""The upcoming parliamentary elections are a particularly critical step in Egypt's democratic transition."" Egyptian Finance Minister Almorsy Hegazi said Sunday that he expects an agreement between Egypt and the IMF to be clinched before parliamentary elections on April 22. But some prominent members of Egypt's opposition have doubts about accepting IMF aid because of the strings attached to it. The April 6 youth movement said the loan ""puts the people in severe austerity measures."" Labor syndicates, independent think-tanks and Popular Party leader Hamdeen Sabahy have opposed IMF assistance. The conservative Islamic Salafist bloc opposes the loans because they require Egypt to pay interest, a violation of their interpretation of Islam, bloc spokesman Abdelmenem Shahat said. Former foreign minister and Arab League chief Amr Moussa said in February that he supports the IMF package, but  is ""against relying heavily on the loan only."" Moussa called for an international conference to help lift the economy. But many businessmen want the country to go ahead with the loan as soon as possible.  And Hegazi said the government's reform program includes sections about social justice, fighting corruption and tax reforms and that it would be implemented whether or not Egypt comes to terms with the IMF.","Egypt says it will impose reforms with or without IMF loan .

"(CNN)An American health care provider working in Sierra Leone who had a ""high-risk exposure"" to the Ebola virus arrived at Nebraska Medicine on Sunday for ""observation and possible treatment,"" the center said. ""This patient has been exposed to the virus but is not ill and is not contagious,"" said Dr. Phil Smith, medical director of the biocontainment unit at the Omaha medical center. ""However, we will be taking all appropriate precautions."" Nebraska Medical Center, part of Nebraska Medicine, is one of only four hospitals in the United States that has biocontainment units and has been practicing for years to treat a highly infectious disease such as Ebola. The other three hospitals are Emory University Hospital in Atlanta; Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana; and the National Institutes of Health in Maryland. Nebraska Medical Center has treated three patients with Ebola: . Dr. Rick Sacra, who was infected while working in Liberia, was treated and released in September. NBC freelance cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who was also working in Liberia, was treated and released in October. And Dr. Martin Salia, who was gravely ill when he arrived from Sierra Leone, died after less than two days of treatment in November, Nebraska Medicine said. Nebraska Medicine said the patient who arrived Sunday was transported in a private air ambulance. ""This patient will be under observation in the same room used for treatment of the first three patients and will be carefully monitored to see if Ebola disease develops,"" Smith said. While the United States had 10 patients with Ebola last year, the situation in West Africa remains far more dire. More than 7,500 people died from Ebola in 2014, the World Health Organization said. The vast majority of deaths were in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.","The health care worker was in Sierra Leone, one of the hotbeds of Ebola .

"(CNN)For the second time during his papacy, Pope Francis has announced a new group of bishops and archbishops set to become cardinals -- and they come from all over the world. Pope Francis said Sunday that he would hold a meeting of cardinals on February 14 ""during which I will name 15 new Cardinals who, coming from 13 countries from every continent, manifest the indissoluble links between the Church of Rome and the particular Churches present in the world,"" according to Vatican Radio. New cardinals are always important because they set the tone in the church and also elect the next pope, CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John L. Allen said. They are sometimes referred to as the princes of the Catholic Church. The new cardinals come from countries such as Ethiopia, New Zealand and Myanmar. ""This is a pope who very much wants to reach out to people on the margins, and you clearly see that in this set,"" Allen said. ""You're talking about cardinals from typically overlooked places, like Cape Verde, the Pacific island of Tonga, Panama, Thailand, Uruguay."" But for the second time since Francis' election, no Americans made the list. ""Francis' pattern is very clear: He wants to go to the geographical peripheries rather than places that are already top-heavy with cardinals,"" Allen said. Christopher Bellitto, a professor of church history at Kean University in New Jersey, noted that Francis announced his new slate of cardinals on the Catholic Feast of the Epiphany, which commemorates the visit of the Magi to Jesus' birthplace in Bethlehem. ""On feast of three wise men from far away, the Pope's choices for cardinal say that every local church deserves a place at the big table."" In other words, Francis wants a more decentralized church and wants to hear reform ideas from small communities that sit far from Catholicism's power centers, Bellitto said. That doesn't mean Francis is the first pontiff to appoint cardinals from the developing world, though. Beginning in the 1920s, an increasing number of Latin American churchmen were named cardinals, and in the 1960s, St. John XXIII, whom Francis canonized last year, appointed the first cardinals from Japan, the Philippines and Africa. In addition to the 15 new cardinals Francis named on Sunday, five retired archbishops and bishops will also be honored as cardinals. Last year, Pope Francis appointed 19 new cardinals, including bishops from Haiti and Burkina Faso. CNN's Daniel Burke and Christabelle Fombu contributed to this report.","The 15 new cardinals will be installed on February 14 .

"Every 15 seconds, a Syrian becomes a refugee, and those witnessing the violence unfolding on the ground don't believe military action against the regime would bring relief. While a doctor who treats refugees says the regime has a history of becoming more vicious when backed into a corner, one Syrian says he doesn't believe strikes against Bashar al-Assad's forces would be effective because the regime would protect its own people and leave the rest to die so it could blame the massacre on the United States. ""We are stuck in the middle, between the Russians and the Americans, the Iranians and the Saudis, and we are the victims,"" the man said. The United Nations' refugee agency said Tuesday that the number of Syrians who have fled their war-ravaged country has now risen to more than 2 million. A year ago, that number was 230,671. Are chemical weapons a 'red line'? Tell us what you think. ""Syria is haemorrhaging women, children and men who cross borders often with little more than the clothes on their backs,"" the UNHCR said. The increase of nearly 1.8 million people over the past 12 months is an ""alarming"" trend, the agency said, warning that there is ""no sign of this tragic outflow ending."" Also disturbing is that many of the refugees are escaping only to find themselves in a different sort of danger. Hayam, a 25-year-old mother of three in neighboring Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, said she and a friend visited a local organization that was distributing food and were told they needed to drive to a nearby warehouse. There, they encountered a group of men. Aid worker: Syrian refugee crisis creating long-term burden for neighbors . ""They attacked us. We started to scream and cry,"" the woman said, explaining the men attempted to rape them and asked, ""Why are you scared? Nothing happened. You are married. Why are you afraid of this? It's not your first time."" Hayam said she couldn't report the men. ""They will kill me, or they will send me to my parents, and they will kill me. We are a tribal society,"" she said. Another refugee, 14-year-old Rahaf in Beirut, said she was cornered by teenagers while on her way to clean houses, which she's been doing for extra money. ""They scared me. They made me hate life,"" the girl said. Her mother said her daughter told her, ""Mama, I would rather die in our country than have these problems."" The United Nations has said that more than 100,000 people -- including many civilians -- have been killed in Syria since a popular uprising spiraled into a civil war in 2011. ""Syria has become the great tragedy of this century -- a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history,"" said Antonio Guterres, the United Nations' high commissioner for refugees. Syria: What do the neighbors think of potential Western strikes? And there's more somber news: another 4.25 million people are displaced inside Syria, the UNHCR said, meaning that more than 6 million people have been torn from their homes in the country. ""More Syrians are now forcibly displaced than is the case with any other country,"" the agency said. The overwhelming majority of the refugees who leave Syria end up staying in countries in the surrounding region, and the UNHCR said it has less than 50% of the funds it needs to meet their basic needs. That places a heavy strain on the infrastructures, economies and societies of those host countries, the United Nations said. The four biggest recipients of Syrians registered as refugees or awaiting registration are: . Lebanon -- 716,000 . Jordan -- 515,000 . Turkey -- 460,000 . Iraq  -- 168,000 . Government ministers from those four countries will meet with the UNHCR in Geneva Wednesday in an effort to generate greater international support for dealing with the refugee exodus. Wissam Tarif, executive director of the human rights group Insan, which is building a refugee camp in Lebanon, encouraged residents in neighboring countries to open their homes to refugees as prospects for housing them become thinner. ""We will be able to host up to 1,200 families. That's around 10,000 people, but that's nothing compared to the influx that's expected. Lots of people will stay in the streets,"" he said. More than half of the 2 million Syrian refugees are children age 17 or younger, the United Nations said. The British Red Cross suggested that the U.N. figure for the total number of refugees may well be too conservative. ""To have reached this landmark figure of 2 million registered refugees is shocking, but the true figure is likely to be higher,"" said Pete Garratt, a disaster manager for the British group. ""We know there are people who will not have registered for support, for many reasons. They may be afraid of any form of authority or of registering their status."" The organization said that in Jordan, 70% of refugees live in urban areas rather than in camps, which makes it harder for aid agencies to find and help them. ""Our colleagues from the Jordanian Red Crescent report finding families who have not registered, or are worried about coming forward to ask for support,"" Garratt said. ""They are still living with the psychological effects of having been in a conflict zone, and that makes people wary.""

"More federal prisoners serving sentences for non-violent crimes can apply for clemency after the Justice Department announced new rules Wednesday. Deputy Attorney General James Cole announced that the department would broaden the criteria for clemency, a move that is expected to lead to thousands of prisoners -- most serving drug sentences -- filing applications to President Barack Obama seeking to commute their sentences. The changes are part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to modify sentencing laws, allowing for use of rehabilitation and other alternatives to deal with non-violent drug offenders and those who previously faced tough mandatory minimum sentences. Attorney General Eric Holder previewed some of the changes Monday by announcing plans to assign more lawyers to handle an anticipated flood of clemency requests. Crack cocaine at heart of once-common sentencing disparity . ""We are launching this clemency initiative in order to quickly and effectively identify appropriate candidates, candidates who have a clean prison record, do not present a threat to public safety, and were sentenced under out-of-date laws that have since been changed, and are no longer seen as appropriate,"" Cole said at a news conference. The clemency changes would be open to prisoners who have met a set of specific conditions: they must be low-level, non-violent offenders without a significant criminal history and must be serving a federal sentence that would likely be shorter if they were convicted today. They must have served at least 10 years of their sentence and have demonstrated good conduct in prison, with no history of violence before or during their prison term. The pending changes are the latest step in an ongoing effort Holder calls ""Smart on Crime,"" which also seeks to remedy the once-common wide disparity in sentences handed down over powder versus crack cocaine, based on guidelines first enacted by Congress more than 25 years ago. Earlier: Eric Holder seeks to cut mandatory minimum drug sentences . Of the more than 200,000 inmates in the federal prison system, some estimates show the new clemency criteria could apply to about 2,000 prisoners. But the number is likely to fall to perhaps hundreds after government lawyers review the applications. The Justice Department says it doesn't know how many people will end up qualifying because it depends on the applications and how they fit the new criteria. The President has final authority to decide who gets clemency. Obama has been criticized by some civil rights groups for being stingy with his pardons and commutations. But many praised the Justice Department's decision as a good initial step, including a coalition of groups working on sentencing guidelines. The announcement ""marks the beginning of the end of the age of mass incarceration,"" said Jerry Cox, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ""We must seize this historic opportunity to start the process of remedying decades of cruel and unnecessarily harsh sentencing policies."" Cole also announced the appointment of Deborah Leff to lead the department's Office of the Pardon Attorney, which has come under fire for being slow to review a backlog of applications. Cole said the department was setting up an online application system and working with pro-bono attorneys who will assist prisoners in their applications. Mary Price, general counsel for the group Families Against Mandatory Minimums, which advocates for changes to drug sentencing laws, welcomed Cole's announcement. ""The doors of the Office of the Pardon Attorney have been closed to petitioners for too long. This announcement signals a truly welcome change; the culture of 'no' that has dominated that office is being transformed,"" she said. The push to relax sentencing laws has the support of some conservative Republican lawmakers, who believe it is a way to reduce spending on federal prisons and to use alternatives to incarceration to deal with drug problems. However, lawmakers want the changes to be made through Congress rather than through the president's executive power. ""I hope President Obama is not seeking to change sentencing policy unilaterally. Congress, not the President, has authority to make sentencing policy. He should continue to work with Congress rather than once again going it alone, and I'm willing to work with the President on these issues."" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said this week. Cole, in his remarks Wednesday, said the issue is one of fairness.  ""Older, stringent punishments that are out of line with sentences imposed under today's laws erode people's confidence in our criminal justice system, and I am confident that this initiative will go far to promote the most fundamental of American ideals -- equal justice under law,"" Cole said. Three years ago, Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act to address the larger issue of drug sentencing disparities. Sentencing guidelines provided for a 100-to-1 ratio between the penalties for crack cocaine offenses versus those for powdered cocaine, but the fair sentencing law reduced the disparity to 18-to-1.","Rules change is beginning of end of ""mass incarceration,"" advocate says .
The Justice Department announced new rules for non-violent offenders .
Up to 2,000 federal prisoners could be eligible for reduced sentences .
The U.S. criminal justice system must be perceived as being fair, Cole says ."
"When islanders first got a glimpse of Jose Salvador Alvarenga, they saw an extremely weak man wearing only tattered underwear. On his battered boat, a live bird was tethered by its foot -- narrowly missing becoming his next meal. And as he recounted his story, faster than his rescuers could comprehend, Alvarenga ate like he hadn't had a full meal in months. As crazy as it sounds, his tale just might be true after all. New details from the day Alvarenga mysteriously turned up in the Marshall Islands appear to lend weight to his story of drifting across the Pacific Ocean for 13 months. It was a rainy, windy day on Ebon, the atoll where Alvarenga was found January 30. Mayor Ione deBrum was first alerted to the mysterious visitor when a boy biked to her office from the other side of the island. The boy had been dispatched by Amy Libokmeto and Russell Laikedrik -- the islanders who first spotted Alvarenga, yelling and waving a knife from one island over. Libokmeto motioned for him to drop the knife, and then the pair sprang into action, sending word to the mayor and providing Alvarenga with food, water and clean clothes, deBrum told CNN. Alvarenga inhaled pancake after pancake as he and his rescuers communicated with each other using a mix of charades and hand-drawn pictures. DeBrum's son even helped translate the Salvadoran's story, using Spanish skills learned entirely from the animated children's series ""Dora the Explorer."" The story was beyond belief for many. Alvarenga said he set off in late 2012 from Mexico on what was supposed to be a one-day fishing expedition. But he and a 23-year-old companion were blown off-course by northerly winds and then caught in a storm, eventually losing the use of their engines. They had no radio signal to report their plight, he said. Alvarenga said that four weeks into their drift, his companion died of starvation because he refused to eat raw birds and turtles. Eventually, he threw the body overboard. Alvarenga's claims have garnered widespread skepticism about how he could survive the more than 6,000-mile trek across the open ocean. But officials in the Marshall Islands have said repeatedly they have no reason to doubt the story. After more than a week on the island, Alvarenga began his journey home Monday. He posed for photos with dignitaries from the Marshall Islands before boarding a plane headed for Hawaii. Appearing frail but in good spirits, he was taken to the plane in a wheelchair and helped up the stairs by two people. He said that he was very emotional, that he was feeling good and that he was looking forward to getting home. Plans for his repatriation to El Salvador were postponed last week after his health took a turn for the worse. But Marshall Islands Foreign Minister Phillip Muller said Monday that the castaway was in good health and ready to travel. His flight from Amata Kabua International Airport arrived in Honolulu Monday. He is expected to continue his journey and arrive in El Salvador on Tuesday.","A flight carrying Jose Salvador Alvarenga arrives in Hawaii .

"A pair of Colorado farmers were sentenced Tuesday to five years' probation, including six months of in-home detention, for their role in a 2011 listeriosis outbreak that killed roughly three dozen Americans who consumed infected cantaloupe, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Brothers Eric and Ryan Jensen, who grew up cultivating cantaloupes on Jensen Farms, a fixture in the dry plains of southeastern Colorado since the early 1900s, also were sentenced to 100 hours of community service and ordered to pay $150,000 in restitution in connection with the deadliest food outbreak in the United States in nearly 100 years. Each apologized in court to the victims' families. ""My most sincere apologies and deepest regrets. I hope the victims' meeting helped,"" Ryan Jensen said, according to CNN affiliate KMGH. ""I do know that much has been gained in food safety understanding both here and outside the country because of this."" Ryan Jensen also agreed to attend a substance abuse program as part of the sentence. Experts: The outbreak was preventable . ""This has been a huge tragedy. We are very, very sorry. We hope it leads to better understanding of food safety,"" Eric Jensen said. Both brothers pleaded guilty last year to misdemeanor counts of introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce. The prosecution recommended probation because of the cooperation of the brothers, including their willingness to meet with congressional investigators and relatives of their victims, Colorado U.S. Attorney John Walsh said in a statement. ""No sentence of incarceration, restitution or financial penalty can undo the tragic damage done as a result of the contamination at Jensen Farms,"" Walsh said. ""Today's sentence serves as a powerful reminder of farmers' legal and moral responsibility for ensuring their product is safe. Because of the Jensen Farms case and this prosecution, changes have been made regarding how fruit is processed and transported across the country."" Relatives of the victims expressed mixed feelings. ""Our family actually asked that they only get probation and no jail time because we never thought they proved that they were harming the food with intent to do any harm,"" Jeni Exley, whose father, Herb Stevens, died of listeria-related complications. ""I think they're good people but I think they made some bad choices in their farming practices and I think, in the big scheme of things, this is going to put light on the food safety issues we have here in the United States."" Seven surviving family members testified about what the outbreak did to their loved ones, according to KMGH. ""I do want jail time. I'm very bitter,"" said Penny Hauser, who lost her husband of 45 years, Michael Hauser. ""I think if they had gotten some jail time that would have made a big difference. You can say, 'Oh, it wasn't your fault, it could have happened to anybody,' but I bought it, I cut it up and I fed it to him and now I have to live with those consequences. And I don't think Ryan and Eric Jensen understood the magnitude."" Michael Hauser died on February 21, 2012, on his 69th birthday. Thirty-three Americans died as a result of the 2011 outbreak after consuming the infected fruit, authorities said. More than 110 other Americans across 28 states were sickened, many hospitalized, from eating the cantaloupe. The 2011 listeriosis outbreak was the deadliest food outbreak in the United States in nearly 100 years, and the third-deadliest outbreak in U.S. history, according to health officials. It could have been prevented, according to numerous food safety experts and federal health officials. Investigators and health experts eventually descended on Jensen Farms, near the town of Holly, and determined that the outbreak occurred because the brothers who had inherited the fourth-generation farm had changed their packing procedures, substituted in some new equipment and removed an anti-microbial wash. The investigators said they found, among other things, a dripping, potentially contaminated condensation line allowing water to get onto the floor; water was pooling on the floor; sections of the floor had cut holes and jagged sides that were difficult to clean. Samples taken from the pooled water were positive for the listeria that sickened people. On the rolling line where the melons moved, investigators found dirty equipment used to wash and dry the melons, and it could not be easily cleaned. The FDA report stated that ""several areas on both the washing and drying equipment appeared to be uncleanable, and dirt and product buildup was visible on some areas of the equipment, even after it had been disassembled, cleaned, and sanitized."" What's more, inspectors found that an older, secondhand washing machine designed for cleaning potatoes had been substituted to clean the melons.

"(CNN)What would drive a man to give up the luxury of serviced apartments for nothing but Airbnb rentals -- some good, some terrible -- for an entire year? Ask Kevin Lynch. Originally from Chicago, Lynch moved to Shanghai over a year ago with his wife and daughter ""for an adventure."" When a position in the advertising company he works for opened in southern China, he began making extended solo business trips to Hong Kong, each time staying at a different place he found on Airbnb. Originally, Lynch pledged to carry out his Airbnb lifestyle for a year, but now he's hooked and says he'll continue the experiment indefinitely. Get out of the 'expat bubble' ""I wanted to make up for the fact that I didn't grow up in Hong Kong, to gain credibility with clients and really understand Hong Kong beyond that expat bubble that a lot of people stay in,"" says Lynch. ""And it sounded fun,"" he adds. The intrepid traveler has rolled his suitcase all over the territory, deliberately picking neighborhoods far off the beaten trail. When we spoke with him, Lynch was on his 80th Airbnb stay in Lau Fau Shan, an area nearly at the northwestern Hong Kong border known for a once-thriving oyster farming industry. ""The thing that strikes me most strongly about Hong Kong is the diversity of the places I've been to,"" he says. ""If you're not from here, the only things you're seeing are cable cars, the Peak and dense urban neighborhoods in Mongkok and Central. ""But what I have loved so much are the outlying islands, Shek O and Big Wave Bay. ""They have the feel of Southeast Asia, yet you can hop on a train or bus and 20 minutes later you're in the fast-paced chaos again."" The advertising creative says he began his Airbnb project out of his own initiative and acts independently of the company. ""We know each other and like each other,"" says Lynch of his relationship with Airbnb. ""There's no compensation, no discounts, no nothing,"" says Lynch. ""They've had a couple of community gatherings here in Hong Kong that I've been invited to, but other than that we know how to appreciate each other."" We asked Lynch for his five most memorable stays and he happily obliged. Soho . ""I really think that this was by far the highlight of my year,"" says Lynch. ""It was in one of the most predictable neighborhoods -- that expat bubble that I mentioned,"" he says. ""This place was right on Staunton Street just off the SoHo escalator. ""I'm used to walking into places that are super small, but when I walked into this place all I saw was the small couch and table and I thought I'd have to sleep on the couch. ""Then the guy hits this button on the wall and the ceiling lowers down and it stops just a couple centimeters above the table. ""It was the bed. ""It was singly the most crazy aspect of any space I've ever been to before. It was probably not the best sleep, but (it was) the most memorable."" Cheung Chau . Lynch arrived at Cheung Chau without any idea of what he was walking into. ""It was during the week that we have the Buddha's birthday holiday,"" says Lynch. ""I thought I would stay near a beach so I was just looking for an island to stay at and found this place listed."" When he booked the apartment, the host asked him if it was OK that there would be a ban on meat on the island that week. ""I was like, that's weird, but sure. ""Then she asked if I mind that there would be a parade passing right outside my door. Turns out the place is 28 steps -- I counted -- away from the bun towers. ""I found myself in the heart of this crazy unique bun festival. It was one of the most memorable days and I had no idea what I was in for."" Mui Wo . For his stay in Lantau Island's Mui Wo, trying to find the place was half the fun. ""The directions the host gave me were I forget how many turns and bridges and watch out for this building and that one. It was all these hand-drawn things. ""I'm amazed that all these things are just a ferry ride from Central and they retain their character so well."" The home he stayed in was a refurbished cowshed. ""I look for neighborhoods that I've never been to as well as anything that just looks interesting -- good interesting or bad interesting. ""I was the last person to stay at the cowshed before they began renovating the place. I hope they keep the ceiling."" Discovery Bay . When Lynch's daughter came to visit he wanted to find a special place to stay. A 60-foot yacht in a luxury marina in Discovery Bay fit the bill. ""The boat was incredible,"" says Lynch. ""There was a helper, four bedrooms, and because our flight into Hong Kong was delayed we couldn't enjoy the boat very much on our original stay, so the host gave us another free night to make up for it."" Sea Ranch . This residential development on the south end of Lantau Island is only accessible by boat and foot. ""In the 1970s it was a happening place, but it has gone through various bankruptcies and now there are few people living there. ""It has its own private ferry service from Cheung Chau Island. ""I rode that ferry four times and each time there was no more than three people on it and no one talked to each other. It was creepy.""","To get out of the 'expat bubble,' American Kevin Lynch stays only in AirBnbs when in Hong Kong .

"Petro Poroshenko is already the ""Chocolate King"" of Ukraine, but he has his sights set higher: He wants to be president. He's a billionaire thanks to the candy company he started nearly 20 years ago, but, asked recently if it's an advantage to be an oligarch when running for president, Poroshenko sidestepped the question with a hint of a smile on his lips and a hint of steel in his eyes. ""I don't know,"" he said in English. ""You should ask an oligarch about that."" Poroshenko, 48, isn't Ukraine's wealthiest man; his $1.3 billion fortune makes him seventh, according to Forbes magazine's list of the world's billionaires. But his wealth includes experience as well as money. He's a former foreign minister and former chairman of Ukraine's national security and defense council, and now a member of parliament, focusing on European integration. Given the opinion polls ahead of Sunday's election, political analyst Igor Popov has no doubt that Poroshenko will be elected president. He leads by a wide margin over his nearest rival, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, in a field of more than 20 candidates. But if Poroshenko does win, he'll be inheriting a tough job. His country has been wracked by months of violence, with Moscow laying claim to Crimea and separatists declaring independence in several eastern regions of the country bordering Russia. That's the very reason Poroshenko says it's so important to have a presidential election now, when the country has an interim president following the flight to Russia of ousted President Viktor Yanukovych earlier this year. ""We need a legitimate, strong, powerful commander-in-chief of our armed forces. We need a legitimate president who can open dialogue, direct dialogue with all our partners,"" Poroshenko said ahead of a campaign rally in this city about a two-hour drive north of the capital Kiev, in central Ukraine. Rally in the rain . Hundreds of people stood out in the rain in the city's main square for a long speech by Poroshenko during the event, which ended with candidate and crowd singing Ukraine's national anthem and a pro-Ukrainian pop song worthy of the kitschy  Eurovison song contest. Lights of yellow and blue, the colors of Ukraine's national flag, played over the crowd as they sang. When it was over, Poroshenko worked the crowd, handing out autographed cards with his face on them, aides continually replenishing his supply. When the campaign rally was over, he spoke exclusively to CNN. ""My first step immediately after the election would be a visit, not to Brussels, not to Moscow and not even to Washington. My first visit would be to Donetsk,"" he said, referring to one of the main separatist regions in the east, an area now styling itself the independent Donetsk People's Republic. The purpose of the trip would not be to negotiate with the self-styled separatist leaders, he said, denying that they truly represented the people. ""If it is a terrorist, they are not representing the people. They have just 500 people with guns,"" he said, working a small wooden cross on rosary beads between his fingers throughout the interview. But, he said, he was more than willing to talk to anyone elected by the people, and he has no objection to more local self-control. People across Ukraine have ""the right to speak any language they want. The right to elect the leaders they want. The right for the decentralization of power,"" he said. He was firm on his two main goals. ""European integration -- no compromise,"" he declared. ""Crimea and eastern Ukraine, we are fighting for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of my country. No compromise."" Tough enough? But challenged on whether he could work with Vladimir Putin, he dodged the question, refusing even to mention Russia's president by name. Instead, he talked about working with major European powers. And pressed again specifically on Russia and Putin, he fell back on the format of ongoing round table discussions with Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union. Poroshenko argues that his country has earned the right to join the EU. ""Ukraine has already passed a very important exam in February, March, April of this year. More than 100 Ukrainians gave their lives in fighting for democracy,"" he said. While he said he personally would like Ukraine to join NATO, he recognizes that it's not possible at the moment. ""At present we have a war situation. NATO unfortunately will not accept Ukraine,"" he said. The chocolate king has vowed to sell the candy business that made his fortune if he is elected president, but he won't give up his television channel. He gave two reasons for holding onto Channel Five. ""Because this channel two times saved the country, and, reason number two, because the channel is not for sale,"" he said. Hollywood ending . It's possible Poroshenko will win outright in the first round by getting more than 50% of the vote. If he fails to cross that hurdle, he'll face the runner-up in a run-off election. Some Ukrainians are hoping the race will be over on Sunday. One woman wrapped in the Ukrainian flag at the Poroshenko campaign rally said she was planning to vote for him because he's the leading candidate and she wants the race settled as soon as possible. In fact, there is little difference in policy between Poroshenko and Tymoshenko, allies a decade ago in the Orange Revolution who have since become rivals. Igor Popov, the political analyst, said whoever wins the election will disappoint the Ukrainian people. ""The Ukrainian people are looking at all these crises, dreaming that it's a Hollywood movie and when the movie finishes we will see a happy ending,"" he said. ""Now the Ukrainian people are dreaming that the next day after presidential elections, war will stop and the currency rate will come back to normal and all the problems will be solved."" That's not going to happen. ""Nobody could solve all the Ukrainian problems soon and fast, but maybe when we compare Mr. Poroshenko to other politicians, he has the biggest chance to reunite the country,"" Popov added. Poroshenko himself does not lack confidence. At one point during his interview with CNN, he referred to European integration as a goal for ""his first term."" And later he interrupted a question about what he would do if he wins with a correction: ""When I win.""","Poroshenko made his wealth in the candy business .

"India suffered its second massive power failure in two consecutive days Tuesday, depriving as many as 600 million people -- half the country's population -- of electricity and disrupting transportation networks for hours. The first power grid collapse, on Monday, was the country's worst blackout in a decade. It affected seven states in northern India that are home to more than 350 million people. Tuesday's failure was even larger, hitting eastern and northeastern areas as well. Both blackouts cut power in the capital, New Delhi, where residents sweltered. Several hours later, by 9:30 p.m., power had been largely restored, the Power Grid Corporation of India reported on its website. Power in New Delhi and in the northeastern region was fully restored; electricity was 86% restored to the northern region, and 79% restored in the eastern region, it said. The two days of disruption in the third-largest Asian economy has raised questions about its investment in infrastructure. With about 1.2 billion people, India has the world's second-largest population, behind China. At least 300 trains were held up in the affected regions, said Anil Kumar Saxena, a spokesman for Indian Railways. New Delhi's metro system also suffered delays before power was restored, causing chaos for many travelers. Traffic signals also were out, resulting in major jams. Train fire in India kills 32; death toll may rise . During the blackout, one traveler in New Delhi told CNN-IBN that her journey home had taken almost three hours, rather than the usual 40 minutes. ""Long night ahead, with no lights -- I've got my trusty solar lamp ready for the night,"" she said. An elderly woman said she would rely on candles and flashlights to get through the outage, which she blamed on poor governance. Other travelers told CNN-IBN of ruined plans to visit relatives and long waits at stifling stations. Miners in the Burdwan District of West Bengal state were hit by the blackout too. The district's top administrator, O.S. Meena, told CNN that 150 coal miners were working underground when the outage struck, stopping lifts. Authorities switched to emergency supplies to run the elevators, he said. ""All are safe,"" Meena said about the miners. Monday's grid failure struck early Tuesday. By dawn, many backup power systems had run out of fuel; power was partially restored after about six hours, authorities said. Airports and hospitals, running on backup power, remained operational, but many businesses closed, said Jyoti Kamal, senior editor for CNN-IBN. The cause of the problem was the failure to generate sufficient power to keep pace with surging demand, he said. Power is considered a luxury in much of India, where a third of households don't have enough to power even one light bulb, according to last year's census. They tend to be more common during the summer, when demand rises. Some of this summer's increased demand has been caused by farmers using more energy for irrigation and other tasks, in part because rains during this year's monsoon season, which began June 1, are down by more than a fifth. People are also using air conditioning units more to cope with high humidity. The monsoon rains, which last through September but would normally be at their heaviest in July and early August, not only provide rain for agriculture and hydroelectric power, but serve as a natural coolant, said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. Humidity exceeding 80% makes the mid-90s Fahrenheit temperatures feel like more than 100 Fahrenheit. This makes it harder for buildings to cool at night, and harder for people to cool themselves through evaporation of perspiration, all of which lead to higher energy demands, Miller said. Power Minister Sushilkumar Shinde, who has ordered an investigation into Monday's outage, said it had been a decade since an entire grid last failed in north India. He said that the cause of this week's blackouts is not known but that some states, particularly agricultural areas, may have been using more than their share of energy. Prakash Javadekar, a member of India's main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, criticized the government for what he said was ""a huge failure of management in the power sector."" India -- the world's fourth-largest consumer of electricity -- relies on coal for much of its energy but also uses hydroelectric power, which has been affected by the diminished monsoon rains. Observers say the crisis has exposed the need for India to update its infrastructure to meet its growing power needs. ""Economic growth is constrained by inadequate infrastructure,"" among other factors, the U.S. State Department's country report on India says. ""Foreign investment is particularly sought after in power generation,"" it adds, as well as areas including telecommunications, roads and mining. Vulnerability of U.S. electrical grid a concern .

"It sounds like the plot of a bad movie: bugging your boss' office. Sending naked photos around to co-workers. Sexting in the office. Paying for sex in a massage parlor. But it all happened in the federal agency whose motto is ""fidelity, bravery, integrity"" -- the FBI. These lurid details are outlined in confidential internal disciplinary reports obtained by CNN that were issued to FBI employees as a way to deter misconduct. Read the FBI's internal reports (PDF) The FBI hopes these quarterly reports will stem what its assistant director called a ""rash of sexting cases"" involving employees who are using their government-issued devices to send lurid texts and nude photos. ""We're hoping (that) getting the message out in the quarterlies is going to teach people, as well as their supervisors ... you can't do this stuff,"" FBI assistant director Candice Will told CNN this week.  ""When you are given an FBI BlackBerry, it's for official use. It's not to text the woman in another office who you found attractive or to send a picture of yourself in a state of undress.  That is not why we provide you an FBI BlackBerry."" While the vast majority of the FBI's 36,000 employees act professionally, the disciplinary reports issued by the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility show serious misconduct has continued for years. From 2010 to 2012, the FBI disciplined 1,045 employees for a variety of violations, according to the agency. Eighty-five were fired. The internal reports over the last year don't specify job titles, names or the location of the employees.  Yet, they provide exact details of their misdeeds: . -- One employee engaged in a ""romantic relationship with former boyfriend (now husband) knowing he was a drug/user dealer. Employee also lied under oath when questioned during the administrative inquiry about her husband's activities."" -- Another FBI worker ""hid a recording device in supervisor's office. In addition, without authorization, employee made copies of supervisor's negative comments about employee that employee located by conducting an unauthorized search of the supervisor's office and briefcase."" It said the employee ""lied to investigators during (the) course of the administrative inquiry."" -- An FBI supervisor ""repeatedly committed check fraud and lacked candor under oath."" -- One employee ""was involved in a domestic dispute at mistress' apartment, requiring police intervention. Employee was drunk and uncooperative with police"" and ""refused to relinquish his weapon, making it necessary for the officers to physically subdue him, take the loaded weapon and place employee in handcuffs."" -- In other cases, an employee was charged with DUI for the second time, one used a lost or stolen credit card to buy gas, and another was caught in a child pornography sting operation, according to the internal reports. All of the employees in these cases were fired. More FBI employees were disciplined for their transgressions, including one woman who -- according to the reports -- ""used (a) personal cell phone to send nude photographs of herself to other employees"" which ""adversely affected the daily activities of several squads.""  Another FBI worker e-mailed a ""nude photograph of herself to ex-boyfriend's wife.""  Both employees received 10-day suspensions. Another who visited a massage parlor ""and paid for a sexual favor from the masseuse"" received a 14-day suspension.  And an employee who used a government-issued BlackBerry ""to send sexually explicit messages to another employee"" was suspended for five days. Will expressed surprise at some of the behavior outlined in the reports. ""As long I've been doing this ... there are days when I think 'OK, I've seen it all,' but I really haven't,"" Will said.  ""I still get files and I think, 'Wow, I never would have thought of that.'"" Some of the recent cases follow what CNN uncovered in 2011 after obtaining several years of the internal disciplinary reports. Those reports included incidents involving FBI employees sleeping with informants, a sex tape made by an agent and his girlfriend, tapping into FBI databases for unauthorized searches, viewing pornography on bureau computers and other cases of drunk driving. The FBI Agents Association -- which advocates for active and former FBI agents -- said the incidents should be considered in  the proper context. ""It is important to note that the ratio of disciplinary issues among FBI agents are among the lowest in the federal government and private sector,"" the association's president Konrad Motyka told CNN.","CNN obtained FBI internal reports on employee misconduct .

"After eluding capture for more than a dozen years, the legendary boss of one of the world's most powerful and deadly drug trafficking operations was nabbed in a surprise raid on a seaside hotel-condominium tower in a bustling Mexican beach resort, authorities said. Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, who infamously escaped in 2001 from a high-security prison in a laundry cart, was arrested early Saturday in Mazatlan without a single shot being fired, authorities said. A U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that Guzman, accompanied by a female, was captured in a joint operation of Mexican marines and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents that was in the works for four or five weeks. The pressure on Guzman's organization, the Sinaloa cartel, had been mounting for months, with Mexican authorities killing or capturing several of its most brutal lieutenants, a U.S. law enforcement official said. The 'El Chapo' myth: Robin Hood or just hood? Those operations yielded information, including cell phone and other data, that helped Mexican authorities and U.S. drug enforcement agents track Guzman down. At a Mexico City news conference, Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said authorities came close to capturing Guzman, believed to be in his mid-50s, earlier this month. Guzman apparently moved around several homes in Culiacan, Sinaloa, connected by an elaborate network of tunnels also linked to the city's sewer system, Murillo Karam said. The entrances to the seven homes were reinforced with steel, he said, which enabled Guzman to escape via tunnel before marines could break down the doors. On other occasions, authorities decided against attempting to apprehend Guzman in public places. Murillo Karam said forensic experts had ""100%"" confirmation of Guzman's identity. Authorities also seized a weapons cache that included 97 large guns, 36 handguns, two grenade launchers and a rocket launcher. Mexican government footage showed a handcuffed Guzman, with a dark mustache, being escorted by masked marines in Mexico City. A U.S. Homeland Security official said key intelligence in the capture came from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigation. John Torres, a former ranking ICE official, told CNN that information leading to Guzman's capture actually started to develop about five years ago after the Arizona arrests of several people connected to the drug cartel. ICE and Homeland Security were the lead agencies in that investigation. The drug war: What you need to know . Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, via Twitter, recognized the work of Mexican security forces in the historic arrest. Phil Jordan, who spent three decades with the DEA and headed the agency's El Paso Intelligence Center, said the arrest represents a huge blow to the Sinaloa cartel. ""It is a significant arrest, provided he gets extradited immediately to the United States,"" Jordan told CNN. ""If he does not get extradited, then he will be allowed to escape within a period of time. ""When you arrest the most powerful man in the Americas and in Mexico, if you talk to any cartel member, they'll say that he's more powerful than Mexican President Peña Nieto. This would be a significant blow to the overall operations not only in the Americas, but Chapo Guzman had expanded to Europe. He was all over the place. If he is, in fact, incarcerated, until he gets extradited to the United States, it will be business as usual."" In Washington, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called the arrest ""a landmark achievement, and a victory for the citizens of both Mexico and the United States."" ""Guzman was one of the world's most wanted men and the alleged head of a drug-running empire that spans continents,"" Holder said in a statement.  ""The criminal activity Guzman allegedly directed contributed to the death and destruction of millions of lives across the globe through drug addiction, violence, and corruption."" A senior administration official described the arrest as ""huge"" and said it was ""a Mexican-led operation, but one with very strong U.S. government support."" ""This has been a long time coming, and hopefully puts a rest to the nonsense that this Mexican government isn't focusing on security and that the U.S. and Mexico aren't working well together,"" the official told CNN. ""They are, and we do."" In Chicago, where the city's crime commission last year named Guzman its Public Enemy No. 1 --  a designation originally crafted for Al Capone -- authorities praised the arrest. Chicago is among the major destinations of the cartel's drug flow. ""The arrest of Chapo Guzman is significant,"" police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said in a statement. ""This is a victory, but we know the tentacles of his cartel still exist and much more work remains to be done. Demand for narcotics will still remain, so we will continue to partner with the DEA as they fight international drug trade, and we will remain focused on our efforts to eliminate the factors that drive violence in our city."" From New York to Chicago, Texas to San Diego, Guzman and his lieutenants are named in indictments for marijuana, cocaine and heroin trafficking, as well as racketeering, money laundering, kidnapping and conspiracy to commit murder. In Mexico, the diminutive Guzman became a larger-than-life figure as he eluded authorities while expanding a drug empire that spanned the world. His life story became the topic of best-selling books and the subject of adoring songs known as narcocorridos. In the United States, he is wanted on multiple federal drug trafficking and organized crime charges. His nickname, which means ""Shorty,"" matches his 5-foot-6-inch frame. Guzman escaped from a high-security Mexican prison in 2001, reportedly hiding in a laundry basket. Throughout the years, he avoided being caught because of his enormous power to bribe corrupt local, state and federal Mexican officials. ""When you arrest Chapo Guzman you're arresting the leader of all the cartels,"" Jordan said. ""This guy had a hand in everything, and he owned every politician."" Guzman has been included in Forbes' World's Most Powerful People list since 2009. Forbes estimated his fortune at more than $1 billion. Guzman is wanted on numerous drug trafficking and organized crime charges in Mexico and the United States, which had offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest and had sought his extradition in the past. His drug enterprise stretches throughout North America and reaches as far away as Europe and Australia. The Sinaloa cartel has been blamed for its role in the bloody drug war that has plagued Mexico in recent years, leaving tens of thousands of people dead. Guzman was born in Badiraguato, Sinaloa, at a time when the drug trade was evolving, and began his career in the drug trade working for powerful drug lord Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, according to a biography by Time. He founded his own cartel in 1980, and quickly established outposts in a number of states, eventually inheriting some of his mentor's territory, according to Time. Guzman's arrest caught Jordan and other observers by surprise. ""There is no way that I would have bet that they would have ever arrested him under this administration unless he double-crossed somebody or didn't make the full payments on bribes,"" Jordan said, citing Guzman's alleged ties to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.

"(CNN)If you don't know who Stuart Scott was, those who do will likely point you to one particular speech to share why his death reverberates so strongly across the country. Scott, a veteran anchor on ESPN, died Sunday after a seven-year battle with cancer. He was 49. He built a career as a sports anchor, but his eloquent observations on his battle with cancer, and the encouragement and motivation to others fighting the disease, made him a role model. Opinion: Why Scott was a game changer . ""When you die, that does not mean you lose to cancer,"" Scott said in the July speech at the ESPY Awards. ""You beat cancer by how you live, why you live and the manner in which you live."" It is a line that anyone who has lost a loved one to cancer can take comfort in, and one being repeated much on Sunday, following Scott's death. Scott was accepting the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at the ESPYs, and honored the award's namesake -- college basketball coach and broadcaster Jim Valvano -- by reflecting on Valvano's own speech in 1993. ""I listened to what Jim Valvano said 21 years ago, the most poignant seven words ever uttered in any speech anywhere: 'Don't give up. Never give up,'"" Scott said. ""I'm not special; I just listen to what the man said. I listen to all that he said, everything that he asked of us."" Scott worked for ESPN for 21 years, and is credited with coining catchphrases like ""Boo-yah"" and ""as cool as the other side of the pillow."" He was born in Chicago and grew up in North Carolina. His early career took him from Florence, South Carolina, to Raleigh, North Carolina, and later to Orlando. Scott was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2007. During that speech, Scott spoke of counting on others for help, and the comfort of family members, even if only to cry with them on the phone. His message was this: ""So live, live. Fight like hell."" In that same speech, Scott made it clear what his priorities were. ""I have one more necessity -- it's really two,"" he said, referring to his daughters. ""The best thing I have ever done, the best thing I will ever do, is be a dad to Taelor and Sydni. It's true."" Rich Eisen, a sportscaster for NFL Network who was previously Scott's SportsCenter partner at ESPN, asked for prayers for Scott's family during an emotional segment Sunday. ""He battled cancer as bravely as anybody else, and I know there many people out there who are battling cancer right now,"" Eisen said. ""Stuart would want you to know to keep fighting."" His ESPN colleagues likewise honored him on air. ""Our colleague, our friend, and our inspiration Stuart Scott passed away earlier today,"" ESPN's Hannah Storm said. President Barack Obama said that although his travels often kept him away from his family, Scott and the ""SportsCenter"" crew kept him company on his trips. ""Over the years, he entertained us, and in the end, he inspired us -- with courage and love,"" Obama said in a statement.","Stuart Scott dies Sunday after a lengthy battle with cancer .

"(CNN)How quickly it's all over. And yet, already, begun again. This Sunday's ""Parts Unknown"" marks the end of yet another season and we tried for a soft landing in Jamaica. I'd like to thank veteran field producer, Josh Ferrell (hopefully you follow his exploits on Twitter @TheMagicalGiant), for heroically volunteering the use of his mighty buttocks for our carefully crafted Bond-inspired cold open. I sent him and the crew to Margaritaville with every intention of depicting the place as a blight on paradise, but the boys apparently had a wonderful time. I stayed behind that day, lounging about Goldeneye, Ian Fleming's former sanctum sanctorum, where he wrote all the Bond novels, getting familiar with the feeling of owning a grotto and drinking many excellent rum punches. Thanks also to Chris Blackwell, owner of Goldeneye, creator of Island Records, legendary mentor to Bob Marley. Superb host. Raconteur. Man with a plan and a vision. The show concerns itself, among other things, with who ""owns"" paradise. Increasingly, everywhere -- whether New York City, Venice, the Jersey Shore or Jamaica -- people who grow up adjacent to water, to idyllic views, lovely beaches, traditional architecture, can no longer afford to live there. Their homes, their neighborhoods are, in the modern economy, the harsh reality of present day, ""undervalued."" Traditional ways of life, like fishing, seem quaint anachronisms when the simple fact is that you can make a lot more money carrying a golf bag for a tourist, or making blender drinks at Margaritaville. Is that a bad thing? So many places I look -- even in America, we see a transition to a service economy. Like the Jamaican fishermen we talked to, moving away from the things we once did. We are increasingly a nation in the business (in someone else's words) of ""selling each other cheeseburgers."" Are there any bad guys in this equation? I don't know. Jamaica has a harsh past and an uncomfortable present. In spite of its spectacular and captivating beauty, it is a place that's easy to romanticize. But one shouldn't, I think, do that. Like a lot of our shows, we come to no neat conclusions. Only more questions -- which is, I suppose, conclusion enough. We are already well underway shooting another season. Hope you liked this one.

"A few hours before Hillary Clinton addressed an audience of around 6,000 people near Denver, the former secretary of state did what few people looking to sell a book would do: She toured a plastics factory. Clinton aides say the event was tied to her family's foundation  -- the Clinton Global Initiative -- and the fact that its annual meeting will be held in Denver later this month. But the optics of the event said something different. After touring the factory and giving short remarks about the power of American business -- ""I am convinced that American businesses can compete and win against anybody anywhere if we are at the top of our game,"" she said -- Clinton stepped off the stage and headed to a rope line of eager factory workers and camera-toting employees. ""Let me shake a few more hands,"" Clinton said, a comment reminiscent of refrains made by Iowa- or New Hampshire-bound politicians. In the last month, these two facts have been evident: Clinton-land wants you to know she has a memoir -- ""Hard Choices"" -- coming out on June 10 and she has become more open about her presidential ambitions. Clinton discusses Berghdal in book . And the two have a lot to do with one another. Instead of surrounding herself with the regular PR flacks and publicists in preparation to sell her book, Clinton has brought on seasoned campaign veterans and political communicators. Sources close to Clinton are talking about ""war rooms"" and ""surrogate operations"" instead of book signings. Clinton to take part in CNN town hall as book launches . ""This is a very well orchestrated roll out that is going to make the book have far more impact and, yes, will add to her sense of candidacy,"" said David Gergen, a senior political analyst with CNN who has deep connections with the Clintons. ""I think what you will see with her over the next year until she makes a firm decision is an occasional set of events like this that will keep her fresh, allow her to say her piece."" 'A very professional operation' In addition to helping Clinton, the hypothetical candidate, Gergen said the book rollout will help her staff. ""It gives them a sense of what a political campaign feels like,"" he said. ""I don't think she has made her final call yet, but she is clearly laying the groundwork in a way that suggests a very professional operation."" Earlier this year, the former senator was also more measured in her remarks and more sheepish when answering questions about 2016. In January, Clinton told an audience in New Orleans that she ""wasn't thinking about"" running and that she has ""tried to get other people not to think about it."" In Portland, she shrugged when asked about 2016 and walked off stage to a chorus of laughs. In Miami, she commended the way the question was asked, but failed to actually answer it. Fast-forward to June and Clinton was more openly talking about the worst-kept-secret in Washington: She is thinking about running for president. In an interview with People Magazine that was part of the book rollout, Clinton said she knows she has ""a decision to make"" on 2016 and that she will ""just have to make my own decision about what I think is right for me."" In her Colorado speech on Monday -- the one after her campaign style tour of the plastics plant -- Clinton called the presidency ""as much a job as it is a mission"" and when asked about how difficult it is to run, she remarked that she ""luckily"" has ""a lot of resilience and a lot of stamina."" Her rhetoric, too, has started to sound more like a campaign. At the end of the speech in Colorado on Monday, Clinton closed with what sounded like an impassioned plea for support and, if the venue was different, for votes. ""Please join me,"" she said, her voice raising over the roaring crowd, ""in making some hard choices for America."" Seasoned hands help communicate message . With the stepped up rhetoric has come a more robust inner circle of Clinton aides to tightly and systematically trickle out information about the book. Once an operation with just a few press staff and advisers - along with dozens of informal friends and longtime confidants - the Clinton world has added a few seasoned political hands to help communicate Clinton's message around the book. The Clinton team brought on Tommy Vietor, a National Security Council spokesman during Obama's first term, to coordinate and assist in the response to the book and questions about Clinton's record at the State Department. It has also tapped Kiki McLean, a former Clinton senior adviser and veteran of five presidential campaigns, to coordinate the surrogate operation around the book. With the new hires comes what one source called a war room of former diplomats who stand ready to respond to criticism of Clinton's tenure at the State Department. It is safe to say that Clinton's book roll out is one of the first to use phrases like war room and surrogate operation. One of Clinton's closest advisers - Philippe Reines - also briefed a group of Democratic national security experts and communicators last week on the political scrutiny over the Benghazi terror attack and the themes of Clinton's book. The meeting was tightly controlled by Clinton's advisers, who told attendees that there would be no leaking what was discussed in the briefing. Outside groups have also begun to step up their activity around the book. Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton messaging and rapid response organization with deep ties to Clinton, hosted media training for their surrogates in May. Ready for Hillary, a pro-Clinton super PAC that is building grassroots support for the former first lady, announced on Wednesday that they would follow Clinton's book tour in ""The Hillary Bus,"" a mobile venue for the group to sign up supporters and support the pseudo-campaign. The groups that have Hillary's back . Leaks and excerpts trickle out . As her aides have been planning and preparing, Clinton has been all over the news. She appeared on the View in May - joking that she was ""running ... around the park"" -- and details about her book have slowly leaked out on a nearly daily basis. The first book excerpts came out in early May, when in honor of Mother's Day Vogue published a passage of Clinton's book that was dedicated to her mother. Then came the book's Author's Note, put out by Simon & Schuster, the book's publisher. Shortly after that, the most highly anticipated chapter of Clinton's book - her recollections and thoughts about Benghazi - was leaked to Politico. The speculation was that Clinton's staff wanted to get the news out of the way early so that it wouldn't shadow the rest of the book. On Thursday, CBS reported that Clinton talks about negotiations for captured soldier Bowe Bergdahl's release and her differences with Obama over arming Syrian rebels in the book, which it said it had gotten a copy of. Along the way, locations for Clinton's book tour were released: New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco, to name a few. If all of this seems reminiscent of a campaign, that's because it is. Seasoned staff, effective surrogate operations and coordinated leaks are what can make or break a political campaign. And as is evident with Clinton's stepped up presence and the slow trickle of news about her campaign, Clinton's book tour appears to be as much a memoir roll out as it is political tune up.","Clinton events look like something from the campaign trail .
She's become more open about her presidential ambitions, although no decision yet .
Rollout of her book will help her staff prepare for if she decides to go for it ."
"""All right, good night."" Those are the last words heard from the cockpit of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Who said them? Was it the captain or his first mate? Or someone else in the cockpit with them? Officials in Washington suspect it was either of the pilots -- and that one or both was involved in MH370's disappearance on March 8. And according to the Malaysian Prime Minister's account of events, by the time those words were spoken, someone had likely already taken steps to alter the flight's path -- intentionally. Malaysian investigators are not ruling out a hijacking by other actors. But they have searched the homes of the pilot and co-pilot. Information from international and Malaysian officials indicate that the Boeing 777-200ER passenger jet may have flown for hours after that last voice contact with the pilots. The duty of all pilots is to aviate, navigate and communicate, in that order, an aviation expert has told CNN. Someone may have kept aviating, but either they couldn't -- or wouldn't -- communicate. This is what we know about the 53-year-old pilot captain and his 27-year-old first mate. Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah . Police had been outside his Malaysia home every day since the plane vanished, a source told CNN. But had not gone inside until recently. When they did, they probably found a flight simulator there. In a YouTube video he apparently posted, Zaharie can be seen sitting in front of one. And in a German online forum for simulator enthusiasts, X-Sim.de, there is a post from November 2012 in his name that says he built it himself. ""About a month ago I finish assembly of FSX and FS9 with 6 monitors."" The message was signed Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah BOEING 777 MALAYSIA AIRLINES. FSX and FS9 are over-the-counter flight simulator games made by Microsoft. On Friday, the CEO of Malaysia Airlines said that everyone is allowed to pursue their hobbies. Zaharie, a pilot with 18,365 flight hours under his belt, is reportedly also a flight instructor. On the same YouTube channel, Zaharie gives workman's tips on tinkering with a refrigerator and an air conditioner. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the social media posts. 1st Officer Fariq Ab Hamid . CNN's aviation correspondent Richard Quest once visited MH370's 1st Officer Fariq Ab Hamid in a Malaysia Airlines cockpit, when he was training. Quest watched him land the plane under supervision of a senior pilot in February. The captain described Fariq's landing as textbook perfect. Fariq joined Malaysia Airlines in 2007. He has 2,763 flying hours behind him and was transitioning to the Boeing 777-200 after finishing training in a flight simulator. As with Zaharie, not much is known to the public about Fariq. But Quest was not the only guest who had joined him in the cockpit. Passenger Jonti Roos got an invitation to check out the cockpit during a flight from Thailand to Malaysia -- one that Fariq was flying with another pilot. She took photos and said Farid and his colleague smoked in the cockpit. After MH 370's disappearance, she reported her experience to journalists. Malaysia Airlines was aghast. ""We are shocked by these allegations,"" the airline said. Such a practice would be illegal on U.S. carriers after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, but not necessarily so on international ones, Quest said. Exploring the possibilities . Does Roos' story open up the possibility that a third or fourth person could have joined Zaharie and Fariq in the cockpit? Like the exact whereabouts of Flight 370, that's yet unknown. But investigators believe that somebody must have done something. Not long after the flight took off from Kuala Lumpur communications systems were disabled, the plane's transponder was turned off, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Saturday. That last device is situated between the pilots and can be shut off with a twist of the wrist. For a pilot to turn it off would seem reckless because the information it transmits gives the plane vital protection. It helps people on the ground locate the plane. Someone would have to know how to do it and also know the plane would lose that protection. Then someone in the cockpit said good night. And the apparent lack of visibility on radar? ""Airline pilots are not trained for radar avoidance,"" said aviation expert Keith Wolzinger, a former 777 pilot. They like to stay on the radar, because --  again -- it protects their plane. Only military pilots, he said, are usually keen on avoiding radar. The father of a passenger on the missing plane is hoping for an outcome that would sound shocking under normal circumstances. ""I hope the plane was hijacked, because then, at least, there is hope,"" Li from Hebei Province said. He did not give his full name. Li is waiting at a Beijing hotel with dozens of other passengers' family members awaiting word on the fate of their loved ones. ""But if the worst happened then I will have no meaning in my life. This is my only son,"" Li said. As he walked away, he bent his head and cried.

"Pope John Paul II called Wadowice, the small Polish town in which he was born, ""the place where it all began."" During a visit here in his final years, the popular pontiff delighted a huge crowd with anecdotes about chowing down kremowki, the local cream pastries which he reportedly once ate 13 of in a failed attempt to win a wager. The Pope, born Karol Wojtyla in 1920, lived in Wadowice, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) down the road from Krakow, until he was 18. Unsurprisingly, the town is proud of its most famous son. When he was declared a saint earlier this year, an estimated 10,000 cheering residents and pilgrims filled the town's streets, releasing balloons in the white and yellow colors of the Vatican. Wadowice now claims three saints -- Father Rafal Kalinowski was canonized in 1991 and Jozef Bilczewski in 2005 -- but John Paul II's enduring popularity will ensure visitors are likely to descend for decades to come. ""Each year, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims and tourists come to Wadowice, and the main reason for that is John Paul II,"" says Stanislaw Kotarba, a local government official. ""We expect even more visitors following the recent canonization, as more people hear of the pope's legacy."" To greet them, the town has created a 4.5-kilometer ""Karol Wojtyla foot trail"" connecting sites of interest to pilgrims. There are also plenty of non-papal attractions along the way. Here's what's on offer: . John Paul II's family home . The apartment building where Wojtyla was born and lived with his family before World War II has been open to the public as a museum since 1984. The rooms in which he lived have been preserved as they once were, while the rest of the building was expanded in a three-year renovation in time for April 2014's canonization. It currently features a trove of John Paul II memorabilia, such as original school documents and childhood items. Family home (link in Polish), 7 Koscielna St.; +48 33 823 35 55 . Municipal Museum/former creamery . This 19th-century building once housed a diner where, after the death of Wojtyla's mother, his father regularly took him. Nowadays it's a tourist info office and a town museum with exhibitions on local history and -- let's face it, he's the star attraction -- John Paul II's Wadowice experience. There's a good coffee and gift shop in the cellar . Municipal Museum, 4 Koscielna St.; +48 33 873 81 00 . Minor Basilica . In this elaborate baroque church from the 18th century, the future pope was baptized, received First Communion and served as an altar boy. Its ornate interior features Wojtyla's baptismal font and a picture of Our Mother of Perpetual Help, which he used to pray before. Just in case anyone's forgotten why they're visiting, a statue of John Paul II greets visitors at the entrance. Minor Basilica, 1 Jana Pawla II Place; +48 33 873 20 96 . Town Hall/former General School for Men . This functional building is probably just for die hard pope enthusiasts or fans of municipal politics. It's the current seat of the mayor and town council, but it once housed the General School for Men, which Wojtyla attended from 1926 to 1930. Town Hall, 23 Jana Pawla II Place, 23; +48 33 873 18 11 . Marcin Wadowita Secondary School . Another spartan building on an otherwise charming street, this is where Wojtyla attended middle school between 1930 and 1938. The present-day high school is named after another religious figure, Wadowice's first renowned resident, Marcin Wadowita, a Polish priest, theologian and academic born in 1567. Marcin Wadowita School, 16 Mickiewicza St.; +48 33 823 41 44 . Church of St. Peter the Apostle . A futuristic, airy counterpoint to the intense opulence of the Basilica, this stylish church was built to honor Wojtyla's election to the papacy and his survival of a 1981 assassination attempt in the Vatican's St. Peter's Square. John Paul II got to see the church's space age interior for himself when he dropped in to consecrate it during his second papal visit to Wadowice. Church of St. Peter the Apostle, 90 Matki Bozej Fatimskiej Ave.; +48 33 823 28 88 . The Cultural Center/former building of the 'Sokol' Society . Hard though it is to imagine a pope flying through the air, in his formative years Wojtyla was a regular at ""Sokol,"" a patriotic Polish gymnastic society that hosted cultural and sporting events. The future pope took part in physical education classes and theater plays in what would later be rebuilt as a cultural center featuring a 3D cinema. The Cultural Center, 1 Teatralna; +48 33 823 31 56 . Market Square . The recently renovated town square features numerous restaurants, beer gardens and cafes selling the cream cakes John Paul II vividly recalled. Prior to that, few people outside Wadowice knew about kremowki and there was only one baker who made them. Since the pope's mention, however, many bakeries have opened to keep up with the huge demand. The original is long gone, replaced by new ventures. Despite modern decor and free Wi-Fi, Galicjanka is a bakery, confectionery and coffee shop with baking traditions that go back several generations. Kawiarnia Galicja is an elegant spot next door to the pope's family house -- it features a secluded patio garden. Galicjanka, 13 Jana Pawla II Place; +48 33 488 01 02 . Kawiarnia Galicja, 5 Koscielna St.; +48 33 823 34 20 . Peak of John Paul II (Gron Jana Pawla II) It takes serious exercise to work off those cream cakes. During his school days, the future pope liked to hike in Wadowice's surrounding Beskidy (sometimes spelled Beskid) Mountains, which includes an 890-meter peak, then known as Jaworzyna. The mountain has been renamed in John Paul II's honor and a chapel is located on the summit. There's lodging and dining available at the nearby Leskowiec hostel, in operation since 1932.

"Hong Kong (CNN)It's an unusually cold December evening in Hong Kong. At this particular running track, only a few dedicated runners are braving the frigid temperatures -- a couple of high-school sprinters, an old man shuffling along, a middle-aged man who just changed out of his suit and tie for a post-work run. Among this cluster of fitness enthusiasts are the Fearless Dragons -- all of them dressed in black uniforms, running together, completely in sync. From afar, any ordinary bystander would never have guessed that the Fearless Dragons are in fact made up of blind runners paired up with deaf runners and a few ""guide runners"" who help ensure the team stays on track. Formed just four years ago, this remarkable running team of almost 60 runners has already competed in marathons around the world including Kyoto, Shanghai, Australia's Gold Coast, Seoul and Taipei in addition to local Hong Kong races. ""The major objective of the Fearless Dragons is to raise the public awareness of persons with specific needs,"" says Kim Mok, founder of the running team. ""We want to provide a platform for people with disability to realize their potential."" Mok completely lost his own vision when he was 13. In 1999, one of Mok's closest friends who was also completely blind committed suicide because of immense feelings of social isolation and discrimination. ""I said to myself, one day I will do something for the community and do my best to allow disabled persons to live a fulfilled life."" Back then, those with disabilities could hardly rely on the government to help them integrate into society. ""In 1980s or early 1990s, the Equal Opportunities commission was not even established,"" explains Mok. Furthermore, people with disabilities were only allowed to complete Form 3 level of education. ""Only those who came first or elite students were admitted to normal schools."" Fortunately, after the government signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, things have changed for the better over the years and there have been many efforts ever since to create a barrier-free environment. However, one area of improvement remains: there is little support for the children of parents with disabilities who may not have any disabilities themselves. ""It leads to a vicious cycle of poverty,"" says Mok. The Fearless Dragons team is part of Mok's larger initiative called the Hong Kong Network for the Promotion of Inclusive Society that -- among its many other programs -- has set up an education fund for those children. The team runs races to raise money for this fund that in turn helps counsel the children and provides them with appropriate home tutors when necessary.","In Hong Kong, there's something a little different about running team Fearless Dragons .

"The time is nearing for a potentially definitive U.S. response to alleged Syrian government atrocities and an increasingly violent military crackdown in Egypt, President Barack Obama said in an exclusive interview broadcast Friday on CNN's ""New Day."" The U.S. remains ""one indispensable nation"" in the volatile Middle East and elsewhere, Obama told ""New Day"" anchor Chris Cuomo. ""We have to think through strategically what's going to be in our long term national interests."" Asked by Cuomo whether the U.S. government is now facing a ""more abbreviated time frame"" on key decisions in Egypt and Syria, Obama repeatedly gave a one-word response: yes. The president sat down with Cuomo on Thursday evening -- after having delivered a speech in Syracuse, New York -- to discuss a wide range of critical domestic and international issues. These included upheavals abroad, soaring college tuition at home, a possible government shutdown this fall, and politically sensitive revelations of illegal surveillance by the National Security Agency. Obama plans to embrace a hero at the White House . Read the interview transcript . Asked about claims by anti-regime activists in Syria that Bashar al-Assad's government used chemical weapons in an attack that was said to have killed more than 1,300 people, Obama responded that officials are ""right now gathering information"" and that ""what we've seen indicates that this is clearly a big event of grave concern."" ""It is very troublesome,"" the president stressed. Obama said U.S. officials are pushing ""to prompt better action"" from the United Nations, and are calling on the Syrian government to allow an investigation of the site of the alleged attack outside Damascus. ""We don't expect cooperation (from the Syrian government), given their past history,"" Obama conceded. He quickly followed up with a warning, however, that ""core national interests"" of the U.S. are now involved in Syria's civil war, ""both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region."" A new push on college affordability . Obama spoke to CNN on the first day of a bus tour selling his new higher education affordability proposal, which includes a  plan to create a college ratings system designed to better inform parents and students while pressuring colleges and universities to lower skyrocketing tuition costs. The president told Cuomo that the rapidly rising cost of a college education has been fueled both by liberals who haven't demanded that colleges control costs, and conservatives who downplay the burden placed on students. Obama: Conservatives, liberals share blame on college cost spike . ""The problem we've got right now is that when it comes to liberals, they've tended to say, 'Let's just give more money to the system and increase student loans and grants and aid,'"" Obama argued.  ""And then, you know, you've got some on the right who've said, 'Money doesn't matter, and young people should be able to figure it out on their own.'"" In 2011, students owed an average of nearly $27,000 in loans, making it second only to mortgages in consumer debt. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill recently struck a deal maintaining current low interest rates on loans.  Higher education loan rates are now tied to the market rates, however, which means they will rise in the future. Obama called the congressional compromise a ""stop-gap measure"" that doesn't deal with the underlying problems of rising costs of higher education. Pressure for tougher action on Syria . Cuomo asked Obama to respond to harsh criticism from his 2008 presidential rival, Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain, who recently argued on ""New Day"" that America's credibility in the region has been damaged by a slow administration response in both Syria and Egypt. ""I am sympathetic to Senator McCain's passion for helping people work through what is an extraordinarily difficult and heartbreaking situation, both in Syria and in Egypt,"" Obama replied. ""But what I think the American people also expect me to do as president is to think through what we do from the perspective of what is in our long term national interests."" Obama warned against getting ""mired in very difficult situations ... (and) being drawn into very expensive, difficult, costly interventions that actually breed more resentment in the region."" Obama: Syria will 'require America's attention' Cuomo noted it has now been a year since Obama first said the use of chemical weapons in Syria would cross a ""red line"" and force a tough U.S. response. Administration officials confirmed in June that chemical agents were used in April, resulting in an uptick of military aid to rebels that did little to assuage White House critics. ""If the U.S. goes in and attacks another country without a U.N. mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented, then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it,"" Obama told Cuomo. ""Do we have the coalition to make it work?"" he asked. ""You know, those are considerations that we have to take into account."" The costs of military action ""have to take those into account as we try to work within an international framework to do everything we can to see Assad ousted,"" Obama concluded. Syria under pressure to allow probe of chemical weapons claim . The crisis in Egypt . Cuomo also asked Obama about a growing congressional push to cut off over $1.2 billion in U.S. aid to the military-backed government in Egypt, where a military crackdown on supporters of deposed President Mohamed Morsy has resulted in the killing of roughly 900 people. Obama: Aid to Egypt no longer business as usual . So far, the Pentagon has canceled upcoming military exercises and delayed the delivery of fighter jets, and is reviewing all other aspects of assistance, including military and economic help. ""My sense ... with Egypt is that the aid itself may not reverse what the interim government does,"" Obama said. ""But I think what most Americans would say is that we have to be very careful about being seen as aiding and abetting actions that we think run contrary to our values and our ideals."" The president said the administration is currently ""doing a full evaluation of the U.S.-Egyptian relationship,"" and that there is ""no doubt that we can't return to business as usual, given what's happened."" ""There was a space right after Mr. Morsy was removed in which we did a lot of heavy lifting and a lot of diplomatic work to try to encourage the military to move in a path of reconciliation,"" the president added. But ""they did not take that opportunity."" A looming fight with congressional Republicans . Obama was slightly less diplomatic in his discussion of politics back in Washington, where a number of GOP congressional critics are spoiling for a fight this fall over the possibility of a partial government shutdown after September 30 and the need to raise the federal debt limit. Obama: Republicans privately 'agree' with me . Specifically, conservatives in the GOP-controlled House of Representatives are debating using both issues as leverage to force new budget cuts and defund Obamacare, the president's signature health care reform law. ""There is nobody out there who thinks that us not paying bills we've already racked up is good for the economy (or) is appropriate,"" Obama argued.  ""Nobody thinks that. So why are we even talking about?"" As for shutting down the government, that's ""bad for not just people who work for the government, but all the contractors ... and the defense folks and everybody who is impacted by the services that they receive from the federal government,"" Obama said. But ""Republicans, after having taken 40 votes to try to get rid of Obamacare, see this as their last gasp."" The NSA and privacy concerns . Asked about the latest revelation that the National Security Agency inadvertently pulled some Americans' e-mails, Obama argued that the news shows ""all these safeguards, checks, audits, (and) oversight worked."" Obama said he is confident no one at the NSA is ""trying to abuse this program or listen in on people's e-mail.""  But he said there are ""legitimate concerns that people have"" regarding rapidly changing surveillance technology. ""There's no doubt that, for all the work that's been done to protect the American people's privacy, the capabilities of the NSA are scary to people,"" Obama said. ""What I recognize is that we're going to have to continue to improve the safeguards.  And as technology moves forward, that means that we may be able to build technologies that give people more assurance,"" he added . Obama: NSA revelations show oversight worked . The Washington Post reported last week that an internal audit of the NSA found the agency had broken privacy rules ""thousands of times each year"" since 2008. The 2012 audit, the Post reported, found 2,776 incidents of ""unauthorized collection, storage, access to or distribution of legally protected communications"" in the preceding 12 months. The newspaper received the internal audit from NSA leaker Edward Snowden, who sparked the controversy over domestic surveillance when he first stepped forward in June. An empty nest and a new dog . Asked about life at home at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Obama said he's starting to brace himself for the day when his daughters, Sasha and Malia, head off to college. ""What I'm discovering is that each year, I get more excited about spending time with them,"" the president said.  But  ""they get a little less excited"" about spending time with their parents. The first couple is dealing with the change in part with the help of a new dog --  a Portuguese water dog named Sunny. ""I think there is an element from Michelle and me, we see what's coming, and we need to make sure that we have somebody who greets us at the door when we get home,"" Obama noted. The Obamas also have another Portuguese water dog, Bo, who was brought by the first family to the White House in 2009.

"Washington (CNN)Rep. Steve Scalise may have attended a gathering of a white supremacist group, David Duke, the former Klu Klux Klan leader who founded the group said on CNN Saturday. ""I've got conflicting reports,"" Duke told CNN's Michael Smerconish. ""One person said that he was a no-show, that he was scheduled to come — one person said that he did come. I just don't know what the truth is."" Duke added that ""it seems that Mr. Scalise thinks he may have. That's why he's — he's covering himself."" Duke was in Russia at the time of the 2002 conference of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization, considered by many civil rights groups to be a hate group. The event in question has drawn intense scrutiny after a local Louisiana political blogger uncovered comments on an online forum suggesting Scalise spoke there in 2002. The controversy surrounding Scalise's appearance has sparked calls for the Louisiana Republican to resign from his House Republican leadership position and created unwanted headaches for the GOP as they prepare to take over full control of Congress next week. While he said he remains murky on the actual details of who spoke at the event thirteen years ago, Duke threatened to ""name names"" of lawmakers with whom he's ""had relationships"" if they continue to attack Scalise. ""I would name names of any Democrat — and I know some Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives — who tried, in fact urged me, to support them,"" he said. He added while he respects the privacy of those with whom he's had relationships, ""I would call them out if they [were] hypocritical."" Scalise himself has said while he doesn't remember speaking to the group, he may have, as he was barnstorming his district as a state representative seeking support for a proposal. The lawmaker has distanced himself from the group's viewpoints and apologized for speaking there, calling it a ""mistake."" But conflicting reports from Duke and his advisor, Kenny Knight, who organized the event, continue to raise questions about what actually happened that day. Knight has said previously Scalise didn't in fact speak to the group, and only came to talk to a meeting of a civic association gathering before the EURO event. Duke on Saturday insisted that even if Scalise spoke to his group, they were not supporters of one another. ""I was not his supporter, he was not my supporter. I did not contribute to him, he did not contribute to me, okay?"" Duke said. ""He was not a member of my organization — he was an early young representative who just got elected in Louisiana, and he was pushing a tax program, and he was coming to constituents. And again, I believe that every elected official has a responsibility to hear out people who are right wing, left wing."" Duke also downplayed the controversy surrounding his group, comparing it to the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic-American rights group, or the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, an African-American rights group, and noting that elected officials speak to both of those without blowback. ""But he came to a European organization — big problem,"" he noted. ""And don't forget, he was an elected official. So what is America all about? Don't we, aren't we supposed to believe that if you're an elected official...you're representing all the people in your district?"" Duke said that at the time he was a very popular figure in Louisiana, forging multiple unsuccessful statewide runs and at one point contemplating a run for president. And Duke alleged that the ""national media"" was ""racist"" and may have contributed to the controversy. ""Maybe the national media, which I consider to be very racist against European Americans, I think that they have really caused the incitement of African Americans against European Americans, and I also think that they've also facilitated European Americans being angry against African Americans,"" he said.","David Duke said Saturday that Rep.

"Singer Chris Brown has been booted from court-ordered drug rehab and taken into custody by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies, a sheriff's spokesman confirmed Friday. Details were not immediately available about why Brown, 24, was kicked out of the Malibu facility where he has been treated for the past four months. Nor was it clear exactly why he was taken into immediate custody, but he had been serving a five-year probation sentence when he entered rehab. That sentence stemmed from a 2009 assault on then-girlfriend Rihanna. He was ""cooperative when taken into custody"" as he was picked up from the facility and taken to the Los Angeles County men's central jail where he was being held without bail Friday afternoon, a sheriff's department statement said. His lawyer and representatives did not immediately respond to CNN calls for comment. Brown's legal troubles began five years ago when he beat Rihanna as the two were in a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street. He pleaded guilty to felony assault in June 2009, which resulted in a sentence of five years of probation and 1,400 hours of community labor. The judge has revoked Brown's probation twice in the last year, most recently because of his arrest on a sidewalk near the White House after allegedly punching a man. Brown voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a Washington jail in October, but he was kicked out a few days later for ""throwing a rock through his mother's car window"" after a family session at the center, a probation report said. Brown was upset because his mother said she wanted him to stay in treatment, the report said. ""Mr. Brown preceded to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother's car window and it shattered,"" according to letter from the rehab center included in the probation report. His probation was revoked last November, but the judge allowed him to stay out of jail by entering a 90-day anger management and drug rehab program.   Although he completed that program last month, the judge ordered him to remain a resident at the Malibu treatment facility until another hearing on April 23. Brown's probation officer reported at a hearing last month that the singer ""continues to make great improvement"" in dealing with anger, stress and drugs, but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for an assault charge in Washington on April 17.  If he is convicted in that case, the judge would decide at an April 23 hearing if Brown should complete his probation in jail. Brown has been working on a highway cleanup labor crew in Los Angeles three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements, his probation report said. At that rate, Brown could complete the labor in mid-October and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year.","The singer was ""cooperative when taken into custody,"" sheriff's statement says .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Border Patrol agent was arrested Tuesday on narcotics smuggling charges, but the federal agency declined to release his name, a spokesman told CNN. The agent, who was turned over to the Drug Enforcement Administration, was being held in the Yuma, Arizona, County jail, said Kenneth Quillin, supervisory border patrol agent. The agent, who has three years' experience with the border patrol, was arrested after two other Border Patrol agents on Monday were patrolling along the U.S.-Mexico border and saw the suspect agent with ""numerous bundles of marijuana inside a marked Border Patrol truck,"" Quillin said in a statement. The agents reported the incident to a supervisor, and the suspect agent, along with the marijuana, was placed in the custody of the DEA, Quillin said. Rodolfo Karisch, acting chief patrol agent for the Yuma Sector, said he was ""proud of the swift and appropriate actions taken by the arresting agents."" ""They knew the right thing to do and did it, as expected. They put honor first and are to be commended. This can not be said of the suspect,"" he said in a statement. ""I will not refer to the subject of this arrest as 'one of us.' By his alleged actions, he has tarnished our image,"" Karisch said in a statement. ""We will pursue the prosecution of this individual to the fullest extent allowed by law.""","The U.S. Border Patrol agent was allegedly caught with marijuana .

"Editor's note: Dina Mehta is an ethnographer, social media consultant and blogger based in Mumbai, India. Her personal blog is Conversations with Dina. She has contributed to building several communities on the Internet, such as Worldchanging, Tsunami Help, KatrinaHelp, SkypeJournal and Global Voices Online. Dina Mehta says social networks channeled the sadness and rage of the attacks into action. MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- I celebrated my 42nd birthday on November 26. We were thinking of stepping out for a coffee at the Taj hotel that night when a friend called to say there was a terrorist attack in town. My first reaction was to switch on the TV and simultaneously go online to Twitter. There was a lot of confusion, anger and sadness as we witnessed together parts of our city go up in flames -- icons and symbols that stand for the Bombay I grew up in. I live about 8 kilometers from the scenes of the attacks. Many of us didn't sleep much that night. Some of us have worked together during disasters like the tsunamis and Hurricane Katrina, and we used our influence and experience to get the word out. Our updates and conversations on Twitter kept us connected. Twitter is a social tool where social networking meets blogging. Many have referred to it as microblogging, as each post -- or ""tweet"" -- you make is restricted to 140 characters. We didn't feel alone anymore or scared. Fellow tweeters worldwide were experiencing and sharing in our pain and our anger during the prolonged siege. The morning after, a friend and fellow blogger in the United States asked me how I was coping with it all. Her question was whether I found myself working it through intellectually or emotionally. My answer was that there was anger. Lots of it. And I was not alone in feeling it. Blogging and Twitter allowed me to channel this anger. We were busy trying to source authentic news and information around lists of injured and deceased, hospitals requiring blood, and helping folks abroad and in other cities in India connect with their friends and family. Some of the little things that touched me were people all over the world just volunteering time, love and attention through hugs and words of solace. One example: We had a list of injured people -- an illegible fax -- and after tweeting that we needed help transcribing it, we were flooded with offers to help from all over the world. Others abroad were busy proclaiming that they would run to India and not from it. Here are just a few of the tweets: . • I can't say don't be sad, but don't be overwhelmed with sadness. Know that there's still more love than hate. • hugging you. There are more good and decent people in the world than hateful ones. Even if that's hard to see today. • Overwhelmed by the kind and touching emails that my clients have sent since yesterday. All affirm faith in India and Indians. • I join you and all the brave people of India! • from nyc, we pray for you and thank you for your courage in reporting to the rest of the world. it has greatly helped many . • Just feelings of solidarity with all of you in Mumbai . • We all are. . :( #mumbai . • So sorry for you and your fellow peace loving Indians . • sadness is not the word but anger that should be vented out before we subside into our own daily life . These spontaneous responses bring home so strongly that what we are dealing with is not just Mumbai's problem or India's problem alone. This could never have happened without the social web. It is taking many new people forward on journeys that before they wouldn't have even contemplated. On Monday, a bunch of us met at Leopold Café, one of the sites attacked last week, and lighted some candles and had a beer. Many of us are being asked how people can contribute to help families affected, and today we meet with non-governmental organizations to try to work out how we can harness this amazing energy online into raising funds for those affected by the attacks in the short term. We've been speaking to activist groups on different continents about how we could pool the community and our learnings to make a difference. The ""we"" I speak of is not an organization but a loosely joined community. We are bonded, and I truly believe that in the face of utter horror, wherever it might occur, we have a strong pillar in this emotional connection we feel as equal human beings and not in our narrow identities prescribed by nationality or religion or race or gender. This is an evolving revolution sparked by how people are using social tools on the Web. Of course, as with any social system, there will always be those who wish to perpetuate the politics of religion, of division and hate. We see this on the Web, too. The dilemma is, do we engage with them, and can we? There is no doubt we are being violated in every way, by politics, by religion, by a complete breakdown of security. And yet, I find I do not want to have that discourse or feed these divisions. It feels like a violation of my own person. Leave that to the politicians. Let me act. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dina Mehta.","Dina Mehta: Social media like Twitter became key point of contact and news .

"(CNN)Since 1996, photographer Marja Pirila has been working on her ""Interior/Exterior"" project, using an old technique that is the basis of all photography to create complex, layered works. Pirila puts her subjects in a dark space, covering the windows while leaving a small hole for the outside light to feed in. An inverted landscape -- with colors and depth preserved -- fills the room. This is the camera obscura technique, and it uses a naturally occurring phenomenon that led to the modern-day camera. Most cameras, however, have an internal mirror that flips the image back to the position it appears in real life. Pirila has used the technique for almost 20 years, taking photos of people in Finland, Norway, Italy and France. ""They all have a documentary basis, i.e. they show how/where people live, how their interiors look and what they see from their windows,"" Pirila said. ""But besides this ... because of the two worlds merging down to each other, a third 'reality' is created and made visible. That reflects perhaps mostly my mental landscape, but I feel, at least a bit, (it reflects) also the landscape of the model's mind."" Before working with the technique, Pirila had worked with pinhole cameras, which are essentially camera obscura on a smaller scale. Light and color slide through a small hole to create an inverted image that is absorbed by light-sensitive paper. ""Both techniques are slow and unpredictable and compel one to slow down and stop amid the daily routine,"" Pirila said. ""Moreover, the actual process is crucial in both. They present a challenge to experiment and extend conventional photography."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Pirila decided to explore camera obscura after seeing black-and-white images by Abelardo Morell in a magazine. She couldn't find much information on this technique, and she had many trials before success. Pirila now has about 70 images in her project. Pirila chose models she knew -- students, friends, neighbors or random acquaintances -- though always ""they are people who touch me in one way or other,"" she said. Pirila sets up a room alone, then invites the model into the space. Together they find a place for the subject to pose that is comfortable for the model and aesthetically satisfying for Pirila. ""It is a big pleasure for me to show and share this light phenomena with my model,"" she said. Pirila used color film when she first started the project and has since switched to digital. Film exposures vary from minutes to hours, and digital exposures last anywhere from seconds to minutes, she said. Regardless, models must hold a pose for a relatively long time for a picture to be taken in this space with low light. ""Darkness and long exposures create the contemplative atmosphere and let us enjoy and be inside the magic world which appears in an ordinary room for a while,"" Pirila said. Light is the most important factor in photography, Pirila said, and camera obscura attracted her because of its play with light. ""I feel that the light is my home,"" she said. ""That is why I am a photographer."" Marja Pirila is a photographer based in Finland.","Marja Pirila used the camera obscura technique for her ""Interior/Exterior"" photo project .

"(CNN)Cold, cold and more cold. That's what's on tap in terms of temperature for much of the United States early this week. ""We're looking at 50 million people in 24 states that are going to see some of the coldest weather over the next several days that we have seen in quite some time,"" CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said Sunday. The National Weather Service predicted heavy rains and mountain snow in the Northwest, and snows from the northern Plains to the northern Mid-Atlantic states. ""An Arctic air mass that already invaded the north central U.S. will spread southeastward ... plunging temperatures from the Mississippi Valley to East Coast. ""The cold air blowing over warmer waters will allow snow showers to crank up across the Great Lakes region ... especially downwind of Lake Ontario and Erie,"" it said in a forecast. Wind chill warnings and advisories were in effect for much of Wisconsin, Minnesota and parts of North Dakota and Illinois. ""This arctic cold is potentially deadly and dangerous,"" Maginnis said. ""Wind chills in Minnesota and the Dakotas are as low as minus 45 degrees. And a second blast of cold air will reinforce the deep freeze on Tuesday."" Are you there? Share images, if you can safely . Northern exposure . Rough conditions are on the way in other areas too. A storm system will bring a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain to parts of upstate New York and New England. In the Midwest, snow will also coat portions of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. And farther west, the same forecast faces Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Utah. The South is in for it too.  ""Another reinforcement of the polar air will move its way into the lower 48 this week, plummeting temperatures in the Deep South to below freezing on Thursday into Friday,"" said CNN meteorologist Michael Guy. Mississippi storms . Central Mississippi was cleaning up Sunday after severe weather raked the state a day earlier. Folks in Jasper County were among the hardest hit.

"Washington (CNN)Our first 2015 trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table brought fresh insights on President Obama's early moves, key intelligence on Republican congressional shifts, some North Dakota intrigue and a look back that perhaps has a parallel to the angst some liberals have about their 2016 front-runner. 1. The  'big speech' isn't what it once was, so Obama hits the road . A post-State of the Union road trip is a presidential tradition, but  Obama is planning a pre-speech swing, perhaps to show the times are changing. Julie Pace of The Associated Press says it's the latest attempt by the White House to maximize its political leverage -- all the more important now that Republicans will control both the House and the Senate. ""The White House says that this is a way to get out there, gain momentum and draw up contrasts with Republicans early on. But it also shows that State of the Unions simply aren't as important as they once were,"" said Pace. ""The President's last State of the Union address drew 33 million viewers. It was the lowest number of viewers since Bill Clinton's last address. You still get a big audience, but I think this is interesting, whether this signals that not only this White House but future White Houses will see an incentive in talking to the American people about State of the Union ideas separate from just that one big night. "" 2. Easy sailing for AG choice Lynch? Attorney General Eric Holder has few, if any, friends among Republicans in Congress, and there were predictions of a rocky road for the woman chosen by Obama to take the reins at Justice now that Holder is stepping down. But The Atlantic's Molly Ball tells us that smooth sailing is now the prediction as Loretta Lynch prepares for her confirmation hearings. Yes, Republicans have some big policy differences with the Obama administration and will use the Lynch hearings to air them. But Ball says her reporting found that Lynch herself has made a very good impression on key GOPers. ""She impressed a lot of Republicans in her meetings on the hill last month,"" said Ball. ""Sen. Grassley, who's the incoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee, hasn't said anything negative about her. Senior Republican sources in the Senate tell me they think there may be a little bit of drama but right now she's looking pretty good for confirmation."" 3. Chaffetz's plans for Issa's old committee . The new Congress means some new faces leading key congressional committees, and Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah can be certain of this: He will be compared early and often to his combative predecessor, Rep. Darrell Issa of California. Chaffetz is about to take over the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, the panel that for the past couple of years has held high-profile hearings on the IRS, Benghazi, and other flashpoints between the GOP and the Obama White House. Chaffetz has a more easygoing style than Issa but is no less ambitious -- and no fan of the White House. Ed O'Keefe of The Washington Post shared his reporting on how the new chairman plans to close down some investigations, but then get busy with a new set of oversight priorities. ""He's putting together a bunch of new subcommittees --one to look at Obama's work on energy and the environment and another focused specifically on administrative rules, or all the regulation-writing that is going on across the administration,"" said O'Keefe. ""He says staffers on that subcommittee are tasked with waking up every morning, scouring the Federal Register and all the other pieces of information that are out there about rule-making going on, and hold hearings about them. "" 4. One big question for 2016 -- will Heitkamp take the plunge? In Washington, the big 2016 debate is over when Hillary Clinton will let us know for certain. But in North Dakota, it's Heidi Heitkamp who has things in a bit of a holding pattern. Heitkamp, a Democratic U.S. senator, is looking hard at heading home and running for governor in 2016. Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post took us inside the chess game that could play out if Heitkamp shakes up state politics with a gubernatorial bid. ""She's not up for Senate until 2018, so if she runs for governor in 2016, she can also keep her Senate seat,"" said Henderson. ""But if she wins, she could actually appoint her successor. And Republicans in North Dakota are nervous about that prospect and making some noise and putting bills forward to prevent that little technicality, so she wouldn't be able to do that."" 5.  Clinton and Warren -- this 2016 dynamic has a 1992 parallel . Another big 2016 debate in Washington is whether liberals can somehow convince Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. I vividly recall a similar debate back in late 1991 and early 1992, when then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton was emerging as the Democratic front-runner and annoying some party activists with his argument that Democrats were repeatedly losing presidential elections because the national party was far too liberal. Back then, the liberal at the receiving end of the urgent entreaties was New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. Among those most aggressive on courting Cuomo were the labor unions that Clinton often blamed for pulling Democrats to the left. On deadline day to file for the New Hampshire primary, there was a plane waiting in Albany, New York, to take Cuomo to Concord to declare his candidacy and join the fray. Reporters waited, and a crowd gathered as word spread of the expected drama. I remember sitting in the Concord bureau of The Associated Press and filing the bulletin that Cuomo would NOT run. And on that day and in the days that followed, I recall the relief his decision gave to top lieutenants in the Bill Clinton campaign. The principal reason Clinton survived the roller coaster of character questions in that '92 campaign was his own political skills and tenacity. But it is also fair to note that it turned out to be a relatively weak Democratic field. No offense to Bob Kerrey, Tom Harkin or the late Paul Tsongas, but none emerged as a lasting, serious threat to Clinton. Jerry Brown -- then the former California governor and now back in that job -- held on the longest, but never came close in the delegate chase. Cuomo's decision kept on the sidelines a powerful intellect with proven debate skills -- and earned the New York governor the ""Hamlet on the Hudson"" moniker because of his public debate, largely with himself, over whether to run for president in 1988 and then again in 1992.","Elizabeth Warren's impact on Hillary Clinton camp recalls Mario Cuomo in 1992 .

"When 19-year-old weightlifter Zulfiya Chinshanlo won an Olympics gold medal for Kazakhstan on Monday, her feat was met with disappointment by some in China for what could have been their victory. Her success was also met with questions about her nationality as Chinese media reported Chinshanlo to be a Chinese national. According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, she was born and raised in Yongzhou, Hunan province under the Chinese name Zhao Changling. Xinhua quoted a Hunan provincial sports bureau official, Zhou Junfu, as stating before the London Olympics that Chinshanlo was the same person as Zhao Changling who had been transferred by the bureau to the Kazakhstan team in 2008. China's 'incredible' Ye denies doping allegations . Zhou recalled that during a training exchange in March 2007 in Hunan's capital city, Kazakhstan's weightlifting team expressed interest in having Chinshanlo live in Kazakhstan and represent the country at competitions. She was transferred to Kazakhstan in 2008 with permission to compete in all international competitions, state media said. It was then that she adopted the name of Zulfiya Chinshanlo, according to Xinhua. Chinshanlo was described by Xinhua as a fluent Chinese speaker, but unwilling to address questions relating to China, including when she left China and where her family is located. Asked if she would return to China, she was said to have paused for a long time before replying, ""I don't know."" But she was apparently willing to comment on whether she missed Chinese food, saying she missed glutinous rice cakes -- evidence, Xinhua said, that she appreciates Chinese cuisine and has a ""Chinese stomach."" Eric the Eel dreams of Olympic return . The official Olympics website lists Chinashanlo's birthplace as Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city and its former capital. The International Olympics Committee requires athletes who are switching national teams to wait three years after representing their former team before competing in the Games. The waiting period can be shortened or waived with permission from the International Sports Federation and the National Olympic Committees concerned. Other Chinese athletes have left the nation to seek Olympic glory abroad. In particular, hundreds of stars in table tennis, a sport that China has traditionally excelled at, have competed for other countries. Table tennis player Jun Gao, who won a silver medal for the Chinese team at the 1992 Summer Olympics, later moved to the U.S. and naturalized as a citizen, competing on the U.S. team for three Olympic Games.","Weightlifter Zulfiya Chinshanlo won Olympics gold medal for Kazakhstan .

"As the House prepares to debate Thursday another bill to authorize the Keystone XL pipeline, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the administration's position on the controversial pipeline has not changed. Earnest stopped short of saying directly that President Barack Obama would veto the latest proposal because he has not yet reviewed details of the latest House bill, but said the administration ""has taken a dim view of these kinds of legislative proposals in the past."" ""I think it's fair to say that our, that our dim view of these kinds of proposals has not changed,"" Earnest said. Earnest said if the House legislation is anything like earlier bills, ""the President's senior advisers at the White House would recommend that he veto legislation like that."" ""That continues to be our position,"" he said. Earnest noted that the project is still being reviewed by the State Department to ""determine whether it's in in the national interest."" Congress' plans on the Keystone XL pipeline could also have implications for the Louisiana Senate runoff pitting incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu against Rep. Bill Cassidy. Cassidy is sponsoring the House's bill Thursday and presumptive Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Cassidy will join the Senate's energy committee if elected. Landrieu, who is currently the chairwoman of that committee, is pushing for a vote on the pipeline in the Democratic-held Senate -- a measure that could give her a boost in her energy-rich state as she faces an uphill battle to beat back the challenge from Cassidy. ""This has been a project that has lingered far too long. It is clearly supported by 60 or more members of this body,"" Landrieu said on the Senate floor Wednesday.","Congress has pushed the Keystone Pipeline back to forefront of national politics .

"Here are nine reasons to think armed drones are going to be an increasingly common feature of warfare: . Bergen: Armed drones are key to future of warfare . 1. Given the relatively low costs of drones -- already much cheaper than the costs of a fighter jet and of training a fighter jet pilot -- armed drones will likely play a key role in future conflicts. Armed U.S. Reaper drones, for instance, cost $12 million each and have been frequently deployed against suspected members of al Qaeda, while the F-22 war plane costs around ten times that amount. 2. The virtual monopoly that the United States had on armed drones a decade ago is evaporating. So far, the United States, United Kingdom and Israel are the only nations that have used armed drones in combat. However, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation, 82 countries now own some type of drone, and while only a small number of those nations possess armed drone aircraft, the new players in the world of armed drones include traditional American adversaries such as China, Russia and Iran. 3. Building drones, particularly armed drones, takes sophisticated technology and access to the specific weaponry that can be launched from an unmanned vehicle. But governments are increasingly willing to invest the necessary time and money either to buy or develop them since armed drones are increasingly seen as an integral part of modern warfare. The Teal Group, a defense consulting firm in Virginia, estimated in 2013 that the global market for the research, development and procurement of drones will more than double in the next decade, from $5.2 billion annually to $11.6 billion a year. 4. Israel is the world's largest exporter of drones and drone technology. The state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries has sold drones and drone technology to more than two dozen countries around the world. 5. Last year the scientific adviser to India's defense minister announced that a state military research firm would begin test-firing precision missiles from drones ""in a couple months."" 6. A consortium of Euopean countries, including France, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, is developing an armed drone prototype called the Dassault nEUROn. France plans to manufacture armed drones for its air force based on this prototype. 7. In February 2013, a regional Russian government posted online and then quickly removed photographs of two Russian-made armed drones. The two systems were reportedly scheduled to begin test flights in 2014. 8. At a 2012 air show in China, Chinese companies displayed full-size armed drones, the CH-4 and Yilong. And the following year a state-run newspaper reported that Chinese authorities had considered using armed drones to kill Naw Kham, a drug lord in Myanmar who was accused of murdering 13 Chinese sailors. In the end, China decided to capture Naw Kham instead of launching a drone strike, but the report showed China's capacity to carry out armed drone attacks. Meanwhile, Taiwan has also been building indigenous drone capabilities, and Taiwanese authorities announced in December that they are developing an armed drone. 9. In 2012, an Iranian military commander, Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, disclosed details of a new long-range drone that he claimed can fly 2,000 kilometers (about 1,250 miles), which puts Tel Aviv, Israel, easily in range. A year later, Iran announced it would begin mass-producing and exporting the drone, which is supposedly capable of carrying up to eight missiles.","Peter Bergen, Jennifer Rowland: Drones cost a fraction of a fighter jet .

"Talk about good karma. Well-wishers from around the world are opening their wallets to a homeless man who returned a diamond engagement ring to its rightful owner, after she accidentally dropped it in his donation cup. ""I actually feel like I'm especially lucky to have this ring now. I loved it before. I loved it so much, but I love it so much more now. I feel like it has such great karma,"" Sarah Darling told CNN's ""Starting Point with Soledad O'Brien."" Darling, who is from Kansas City, Missouri, said she was devastated when she realized she'd lost her ring. She almost never takes it off, but it was giving her a bit of a rash so she did, zipping it in her coin purse for safe keeping. Later, she absentmindedly emptied the contents of that purse into the collection cup of Billy Ray Harris, who is homeless and often stays under a bridge in Darling's hometown. It wasn't until the next day that she realized her ring was gone. ""It was horrible. It was such a feeling of loss,"" Darling said. ""It meant so much to me beyond just the financial value."" She went back to look for Harris, but he was gone. She returned the next day and found him. ""I asked him ... 'I don't know if you remember me, but I think I gave you something that's very precious to me,' and he says, 'Was it a ring? Yeah, I have it, I kept it for you,'"" Darling said. She was floored. To show their appreciation, Darling and her husband set up an online fundraiser for Harris. The donations and praise have poured in. ""In life what goes around comes around... Billy - your sweet actions, despite being in dire straits yourself, prove that there is humility in the world... you are one shining example. Lots of love from across the pond,"" wrote Chris and Mel, from Brentwood, England, on the giveforward.com site, which is collecting money. They gave $20. ""I am from Singapore and I greatly am grateful for your honesty!"" wrote Ophelia Wong Zen-na, who gave $10. Brian Paul also gave $10. ""If I wasn't jobless I would give much more, but felt compelled to do something. Billy Ray do your best to become what you've always dreamed you could be. Its never too late. God Bless and thanks for never loosing your character in tough times,"" he wrote. So far, in about a week, more than 3,400 donations have been made, totaling nearly $95,000. The money will be given to Harris at the end of a 90-day campaign. In an update Saturday, Darling's husband, Bill Krejci, called the response ""unreal."" Krejci met with Harris to tell him about the flood of donations and to get to know him better. They went together to make some repairs to Harris' bike. ""We talked about a lot of things related to my family's ring and the many donations. We talked about one day in the future the ring may one day be passed down to my daughter,"" Krejci wrote on the website. ""We talked about how insanely positive all this has been."" Harris told Krejci that he has found a place to stay where he is ""safe and sound."" CNN affiliate KCTV caught up with Harris and asked him how he felt about all the attention he's attracted since returning the ring. ""I like it, but I don't think I deserve it,"" he said. ""What I actually feel like is, 'what has the world come to when a person who returns something that doesn't belong to him and all this happens?'"" Harris said. But for her part, Darling said she is just  grateful for what he did. Many others, she said, would have kept the ring, or sold it. ""I really just hope that my kind of flightiness in that moment leads to something really good for him,"" she said.","Billy Ray Harris returns the ring after Sarah Darling accidentally drops it in his cup .

"German prosecutors have charged a 93-year-old man with being an accessory to murder in at least 300,000 cases while working for the Nazis at the Auschwitz concentration camp. The man, from the German state of Lower Saxony, is accused of having helped remove the luggage left by new arrivals to the camp at the Birkenau rail platform. The aim was to get rid of any clues to the mass killings going on at the camp for inmates arriving later, the state prosecutor's office in Hanover said in a statement. The man, who was not named in the statement, was also tasked with counting the cash found in the belongings and sending it to Nazi headquarters in Berlin, it said. ""The accused must have known that those arriving, mostly Jews, inmates who were deemed as not being fit for labor after the selection process, would immediately be murdered in the purpose built gas chambers,"" the statement said. ""With his actions, the accused helped the Nazi regime gain economic profit and supported the killing that was going on."" The charges are limited to a period that started with an operation by the Nazis to deport mostly Jews from Hungary in 1944. ""Between May 16 and July 11, 1944 at least 137 prison trains arrived at the camp Auschwitz Birkenau, carrying around 425,000 prisoners from Hungary. According to the charges at least 300,000 of those were killed,"" the statement said. The accused was previously charged in 1985 but that case was dropped because of a lack of evidence, it said. A regional court will decide whether the new charges are brought to trial, the state prosecutor's office said. There are already 16 applications from survivors and relatives of survivors of the Hungary operation to be secondary plaintiffs in the case, it added. 89-year-old Philadelphia man accused of war crimes as Nazi death-camp guard .

"It's a scavenger hunt for cash through the most modern of means: social media. An anonymous, wealthy California man is hiding up to $100 or so in public places in San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose and then posting clues to the money's whereabouts through his Twitter page, appropriately dubbed Hidden Cash. The $100 bills or envelopes containing several $20 bills are amounting to $1,000-a-day philanthropy in what the Twitter account calls ""an anonymous social experiment for good."" The results have been a feel-good sensation in California: The Twitter page features selfies of joyous people who found the money -- flashing smiles and cash -- with testimonials of what they're going to do next. The cash hunts ventured into a third city, San Jose, on Wednesday. The anonymous donor and owner of the Twitter page is a real estate investor who's had the good fortune of joining the wealthiest 1% of American society, especially in the past few years, he said. When he recently closed a deal with a six-figure profit, the philanthropist decided to ""give some of it back"" through random acts of kindness, he told CNN. ""This is not a set-up charity, but I wanted to do something fun and creative,"" he said. ""We were thinking of something like the 'Survivor' TV show or something of that nature that was a scavenger hunt. They were basically too involved. So what we did was hide cash in different places. I thought it would be fun, but it's also something simple to execute. All you're doing is leaving money and putting clues on Twitter."" The man said he's between ages 35 and 45 -- and would give no more information. He maintains anonymity because he wants the attention on his pay-it-forward activities, not himself. ""There's some crazy people out there in the world,"" he added. This week, he will expand his hunt-for-cash giveaway to Los Angeles and possibly other cities across the country, if he can secure helpers, he said. He's been giving away about a grand daily since Friday, he said. For example, his Twitter page offered this clue Tuesday with a photograph of San Francisco's waterfront and the Golden Gate Bridge: ""New drop: come for the cash, stay for the views."" The @HiddenCash page even taunted his followers -- which had grown to 70,000 by Tuesday afternoon -- by stating: ""Surprising with almost 70k followers, but the $$$ I just left the water is still there 15+ minutes later. And that was an easy one!"" Izzy Miller, a San Francisco college student, was the lucky hunter who found the $100 bill in an envelope. Miller posted a photograph of himself and the folded $100 bill, joined by CNN correspondent Dan Simon, who found Miller just after Miller found the Benjamin Franklin. Miller learned of the clue after his phone alerted him about a new tweet posted by Hidden Cash. Miller rolled out of bed and dashed to the waterfront. There, he found the ka-ching in an envelope taped to a tourist information box. ""I think it's awesome,"" Miller said. ""It's a totally fun thing to do, and the fact that he's doing it in a philanthropic and charitable mindset makes it even cooler."" Miller said he would buy climbing shoes with the money. On Wednesday, CNN affiliate KTVU in San Jose aired one search live on its morning program based on @HiddenCash tweeting this clue: ""First ever San Jose drop: across from where these sea creatures play, a dog pees in the fall."" The hint displayed a photo of a yellow fire hydrant. The station showed Alex Doxie of San Jose running down the street, searching and then finding an envelope of $135 cash that was taped to the hydrant near the SAP Center, home of the NHL's San Jose Sharks. ""I knew it was going to be right here,"" Doxie said, adding he will use the money to take his wife to dinner and to see his son's semi-final baseball game. The anonymous donor is emotionally moved by the words and photos that successful searchers post on Twitter, he said. ""There's absolutely no political agenda; there's no religious agenda; there's no business agenda,"" the man said of his unconventional philanthropy. ""The whole agenda is random acts of kindness and pay it forward and to put a smile on people's face. ""When I see people retweet the photos and say, 'I could have really used this money' or 'my autistic stepson found it' or 'we shared it with people that were with us at the beach' or 'I bought lunch for my coworkers' or 'just giving it charities,' there's a lot of heartwarming stories for people,"" he said. The anonymous man plans to continue the cash giveaways for the indefinite future. Money is no object for him. It's only the time it takes to set up the hunts. ""I'm running around leaving money in different places, and there's only one me,"" he said, adding that a friend is helping. He would like other wealthy people across the country to follow his lead: ""I'd like for this to become a movement,"" establishing a chain reaction of charitable giving. ""If you can give back, it's at least as rewarding as making good investments and getting big checks and making a lot of money."" He urges people not to look to him -- or lotteries -- as a godsend. There are plenty of job and business opportunities if people look hard enough, he asserted. ""I want to say to the people that are struggling, please realize it's a game. It's pay it forward. Don't look to this or to the lottery to be your financial salvation,"" he said. Still, solicitations flood his inbox: He's now overwhelmed by e-mails (his address is on the Twitter page) from people seeking money for a down payment, mortgage payment, child's college tuition or even dental work. ""That's more than I really bargained for,"" the man said. Still, he has no plans to stop the small-treasure hunts. ""I'm having a great time,"" he declared. The only people who have figured out his identity are his friends, who identified his voice from his audio-only interviews with northern California broadcast outlets.

"Earlier this year, I traveled to the Netherlands to report on a place that had captured my imagination. It is an entire village, where every single resident has severe dementia. Crippled by the prospect of putting their own parents into extended care facilities, two Dutch nurses decided to conduct an experiment: build a village for people with dementia and introduce a new level of humanity to the last few years of their lives. The result is a cutting-edge medical village, called Hogewey. It's the only place of its kind, on its scale, anywhere in the world. All of the residents have dementia. Everyone else, however, from the barber at the local salon to the chefs in the restaurants carry out their regular jobs in addition to being trained as specialized health workers. I have never seen anything like it in the world. The media are rarely allowed inside, in an effort to minimize the disruption of the residents' daily lives, but we were granted access in late March. We don't talk about dementia nearly enough as a society, and I know it can be uncomfortable to imagine yourself or a loved one in that position. But these conversations do need to happen, more than ever. When you consider the developed world, the number of people living with dementia is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050. As things stand now, people with dementia are largely ignored. They live in non-descript buildings and anonymous wards with lots of white coats, non-stop blaring television, and superfluous sedation. But what if more of those wards could look like the picturesque village of Hogewey? An entire village dedicated to caring for people with dementia. Here are 5 things I learned on the inside. 1. Safety first! Six of out 10 people with Alzheimer's disease will wander and become lost, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Fortunately, at Hogewey, getting lost isn't a concern. There's only one way in and one way out of the village -- and that doorway is kept staffed and locked 24 hours a day. Yvonne van Amerongen, one of Hogewey's founders, told me even the residents who make it to this door aren't necessarily trying to leave. Like many people with dementia, they simply see a doorway and want to walk through it. Most of the time, all a staff member has to do is suggest to the resident that the door is broken, and perhaps they should try another. I witnessed with my own eyes as residents simply turned themselves around and walk back in the other direction. To that end, there are other safety modifications in place. An elevator -- something you or I can operate without much thought -- might prove perplexing to someone who suffers from severe dementia. At Hogewey, when a resident walks up to the elevator, a motion sensor summons the elevator, opens the door, and automatically takes the resident to the other floor when they step inside and trigger a weight sensor. 2. Music makes the world go 'round . It's been shown in study after study: music is processed differently in the brain than many other sounds. The words and lyrics are activated on the left side of the brain in the language areas, while the tune and melody are more right brained. Long after patients with dementia lose the ability to carry out a conversation, they can still nod their heads, clap their hands, and stamp their feet. I even saw one very quiet man, Ben Picavet, suddenly start singing along to some traditional Dutch music while his wife, Ada, played the piano. ""We can't talk anymore about everything, but with singing... you can make a good concert together,"" Ada said. ""For me, that's very important."" Music brings joy to the residents' lives. They're able to remember classic Dutch songs they learned when they were children, even if they have difficulty remembering much about their current day. Find out more about the 'Dementia village' 3. Resist the urge to correct a person with dementia . The toughest conversation I had while at Hogewey was with a resident named Jo Verhoef. She was charming and animated, with a smile that warmed the entire room. At nearly 90 years old, Jo was still under the impression that she held a daily job, though she couldn't recall what it was. ""Tomorrow,"" she told me, ""I'll know it, and I'll have to go to it."" Additionally, not only was she under the impression that her parents were still alive, but furthermore that she had just seen them the day before. I asked resident social worker Marjolein de Visser about her strategy when it comes to correcting confusion like this. ""It depends on the phase of dementia,"" she said. ""In the beginning, you can ask, 'Well, how old are you?' And someone says, 'I'm 84.' You say, 'How old would your parents be?' And they can think, 'Oh, that doesn't make sense.'"" Marjolein says the one absolute no-no when dealing with people with dementia is correcting them. ""If one person is having breakfast and they already had breakfast but want it again, you can't say, ""No, you can't. You've already had breakfast"" He won't know, so why would you say it?"" she told me. The memories are fading and their sense of judgment and logic has become impaired. 4. Always keep up appearances . One of the most productive things you can do to help keep a person with dementia from feeling lost, frightened, or agitated is to help them live as familiar a life as possible. To that end, at Hogewey, residents live in one of seven different ""lifestyle"" categories: religious, cultural, urban, homemaker, trade/craft, upper class, and Indonesian. The moods evoked by the furnishing, decoration, and art in each home create an experience reminiscent of each individual's formative years. Residents are also scheduled for regular appointments with the village hairdresser, Ingrid Scheermeijer. She told me when the residents simply get their hair combed, it has a calming effect. They feel as if they're being cared for and pampered. ""Sometimes I have customers that come in very unhappy,"" she told me. ""They look in the mirror, and they feel good. I think it's very important."" 5. Hand holding is good for the heart and head . I spent the majority of my time at Hogewey with two couples, Ada and Ben Picavet, as well as Corrie and Theo Visser. Throughout my interviews with each pair, they sat holding hands. ""It's not possible to talk about everything (anymore),"" Ada told me, ""but we still have this possibility."" ""It's the way we communicate,"" Theo said. ""She squeezes whenever she sees something or feels something. We spend the whole day like this."" Theo told me his marriage is the best it's been in nearly 60 years.","Gupta: 'Dementia village' is one of the most humane things I've seen .
Keeping up appearances helps residents cope .
Music and hand holding keep residents comforted, calm .
A safe environment is key ."
"New York (CNN)For the second time in days, New York police -- joined by officers from departments across the country -- buried one of their own Sunday. And again, a silent protest in blue repeated itself as some officers turned their backs on the city's mayor. The show of dissent happened a week earlier at the funeral for Officer Rafael Ramos, who was killed along with Officer Wenjian Liu as the two patrol partners sat in their squad car. On Sunday at the funeral for Liu, it appeared fewer officers turned their backs as Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke than during the service for Ramos. Before Liu's service, Police Commissioner William Bratton had asked that officers refrain from acting disrespectfully. Some officers have accused the mayor of encouraging anti-police fervor because of his support of protests against police brutality. Tens of thousands had taken to the streets after the death of African-American Eric Garner during an encounter with white NYPD officers in July. Pat Lynch, head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, has taken aim at de Blasio, even saying the mayor's office was stained with the two dead officers' blood. But before Sunday's funeral, Bratton urged officers to be reverent. ""A hero's funeral is about grieving, not grievance,"" Bratton said in a memo. He said the earlier display put all NYPD officers in a bad light. ""It stole the valor, honor and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of detective Rafael Ramos's life and sacrifice,"" his memo read. On Saturday, there was no protest by the police against the mayor. Several officers saluted de Blasio when he arrived for Liu's wake. The best of what the U.S. can be . At the Sunday service, the slain New York Police officer was remembered as a family man, a dedicated police officer, an avid fisherman and a person who embraced the best of what the United States can be. Liu was 12 when his parents emigrated with him in 1994 from Canton, China. His family said that the first souvenir he bought when he arrived was a sticker of the Statue of Liberty. He valued law and order and always wanted to be an officer. Weeping, his wife Pei Xia Chen told the thousands of mourners who gathered at Brooklyn's Aievoli Funeral Home that her husband was dedicated to his job and he understood the awesome responsibility it entailed. ""We spoke about work often,"" she said, ""and how much respect he had for the law, how he applied the law ... with courtesy, with respect and with the highest professionalism."" The couple had been married for only two months when Liu was shot to death December 20 as he sat in his patrol car next his partner, Officer Rafael Ramos. In uniform, Ramos and Liu were apparently murdered simply because they were cops. Their killer had posted on social media his desire to end police officers' lives. In the immediate aftermath of the slayings, de Blasio called the attack on the officers an attack on all New Yorkers. On Sunday, the mayor said that Liu, as well as Ramos, ""embodied our city's most cherished values."" ""(In their deaths, we lost) the very best of us. ... We lost two individuals who were showing us the way,"" the mayor told mourners. Ramos saw his work as ministry and was posthumously appointed honorary NYPD chaplain. He was just hours away from becoming a lay chaplain and graduating from a community-crisis chaplaincy program before his death. He left behind a wife, Maritza, and two sons, Justin and Jaden. Though he majored in accounting in college, Liu joined the police force where he served for seven years. He used his Chinese-language skills as whenever he could, his family said. Bratton described him as an especially empathetic person who often listened to the people he served in New York. Being a cop is about more than paperwork and arrests and keeping watch, Bratton said, it's also about being kind. ""For seven years, he sought out"" those who were suffering and tried to ease that. At Ramos' funeral last weekend, Bratton promoted both men to the rank of detective, first grade. Officer Liu ""believed in the possibility ... of a city free of fear,"" Bratton said, and is the type of ""officer that we want ... and the type that we have."" De Blasio praised Liu for his love of family. The officer rarely took time off but when he did, Liu went fishing. And in those wonderful moments when he caught a big fish, he would share it with his parents and his wife. He was a ""brave and skilled police officer but he was also a kind man, a kind officer, someone who gave of himself,"" the mayor said. ""He wanted to help others in everything he did."" Liu ""walked a path of courage, path of sacrifice, a path of kindness,"" the mayor continued. ""This city welcomed Detective Liu. New York stands a little taller today because of the time he walked among us."" FBI director James Comey was the first to address mourners, speaking about what drives officers to do their job despite the risks. ""They want to do good ... they want to make ordinary life"" better,"" he said. Though political and law enforcement leaders gave moving comments, hearing from Liu's family members was truly heartbreaking. Liu's father wept as he praised his son in Cantonese, saying he was grateful for how much Liu cared for him. Pei Xie Chen spoke directly to her husband: ""You were an amazing man."" Diversity and unity . The ceremonial burning of paper money and the melodic sounds of Buddhist chants marked Liu's wake Saturday. There were throngs of police officers -- many who had traveled from across the country to pay respects in New York. They represented many different cultural backgrounds, like Ramos and Liu. Ramos, a New York native of Puerto Rican descent, was remembered last week at a massive gathering at a Protestant church in Queens. ""This was his dream, to become an NYPD officer,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said outside Liu's wake Saturday. ""In some ways, it's the ultimate assimilation into America, into New York, to become a police officer. And obviously he was so proud, and he was so proud for his whole family."" Cuomo was unable to attend Sunday's service due the recent death of his father. After Liu's funeral, Lynch of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association told reporters that some officers ""feel like they were turned upon by City Hall and we have a right to express our opinions as well, and they did respectfully."" Officers who turned their backs when the mayor spoke did not act, Lynch said, ""inside a church, not inside the service, but outside where it should be done, on the streets, like we have a right to do."" ""This was an organic gesture that started on the streets of New York, and it should be respected,"" he said. After Sunday's service, a drum corps played as officers walked block after block as Liu's body was transported from the funeral home. Officers from around the country joined local officers paying tribute. For more than a half mile away in any direction from the procession, one could see a huge wall of police uniforms. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz, Ray Sanchez and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NYPD commissioner William Bratton said ""Wenjian Liu believed in the possibility of a city free of fear""

"Some people go on pilgrimages abroad for religious reasons or for historical interest. Denis Asselin created his own rite on the Eastern Seaboard in honor of his son who took his own life last year. For 45 days, Denis Asselin walked from Philadelphia to Boston in memory of his son, Nathaniel, who suffered from a severe form of a mental illness called body dysmorphic disorder. He crossed the finish line Thursday. ""I did really pound a lot of my grief into the ground, and I really did kind of let go of the feeling of loss,"" says Asselin, 63, of Cheyney, Pennsylvania. ""To let go of the anger about that, the injustice of that, and the cruelty of all that, and the beautiful metaphor of moving forward is what it is."" More than 150 people -- including patients, doctors and supporters -- came to the rally in Boston on Thursday to greet Asselin. He had been walking every day since April 24. Dad walks 525 miles after son's suicide . Asselin's walk helped raise money and awareness of obsessive-compulsive disorder. As a result of his project, Walking with Nathaniel, he has raised more than $17,000 for the International OCD Foundation. What is BDD? Body dysmorphic disorder is a chronic mental illness characterized by obsessive thoughts about flaws in one's own appearance. Those imperfections are minuscule or even imagined, but they cause patients great suffering because they feel so ashamed of them. One to 2 percent of the population is thought to have body dysmorphic disorder. A 2010 study in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry suggested that people with the condition have abnormal brain function when looking at pictures of their own face. Some patients seek elaborate cosmetic surgery procedures, over and over, but it's never enough. The condition is associated with symptoms of other mental illnesses such as depression, eating disorders, social phobia, anxiety and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps some patients refocus their thoughts and see themselves in a more positive way. There are no approved medications specifically for the condition, but a doctor may prescribe antidepressants. But sometimes the condition can lead a person to attempt to harm himself or herself, or others, and requires hospitalization. Nathaniel Asselin's symptoms began in fifth grade. He became obsessed with running, feeling he needed to go faster each day. His weight began dropping dramatically. At first, therapy and medication helped, but by 11th grade the boy was spending hours in front of the mirror. His parents struggled to find treatments that would work for him, trying their hardest to help. Nathaniel Asselin changed schools, tried homeschooling and underwent intensive therapy, including hospitalizations. On April 15, 2011, he took his own life. The walk . Along Asselin's walk of more than 500 miles, he stopped at schools, clinics and medical facilities where his son had been treated. Inspired by a trip along the Camino de Santiago in Spain with his family, Asselin decided to trek this pilgrimage of his own. To prepare, Asselin practiced walking locally around West Chester, Pennsylvania, between January and March, walking a total of 500 miles in a little over two months. A week into the walk, e-mails started coming to Asselin from people affected by body dysmorphic disorder expressing their deep gratitude for his journey. He also met patients at the rally Thursday. ""I just want to hug them,"" he said. ""I just know what they're going through, it's so, so difficult, and how lonely it must feel to them, and how they must get discouraged,"" Asselin said. ""It's not a well-known disease and the protocols are not completely in place."" One of the most poignant moments for him took place at the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, a private school where he'd taught for 19 years. On the third day of the walk, the entire student body lined the street from the Lower School to the Upper School to wish him well, with the younger kids holding ""Buen Camino"" signs and shouting ""ultreya,"" meaning ""onward."" ""Here are people who are supporting me virtually, who are right there with me, and can't walk with me, but I could feel their energy, and I could feel that this mattered to them,"" he said. Asselin was walking by himself for the most part during the week, but on weekends people would join him -- his wife, his daughter, a cousin, his sister-in-law, other supporters. While he received many offers for accommodation from supporters, sometimes he would have to make last-minute decisions about where to stay, such as after a particularly grueling 28-mile stretch when he didn't stop until he found a hotel. A young woman who had also been at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, at the same time as Nathaniel Asselin, and who also had body-dysmorphic disorder, also reached out. She and Nathaniel Asselin had often walked and talked together. After correspondence throughout the journey, she joined Asselin in walking on Wednesday from McLean on the same 13-mile route that Nathaniel Asselin had taken when he ran away from that hospital in early 2010, when his father had combed the twisting streets of Boston trying to figure out where his son had called him from. Asselin calculated that he took 1,110,000 steps on this journey. At his pace, he says, it was more than the anticipated 525 miles, more like 552. He's not sure what he's going to do next but feels he is being called to do advocacy work for this particular disease. ""Often I felt Nathaniel was with me during this whole walk,"" Asselin said. ""I was walking with Nathaniel. Not walking for Nathaniel. Not walking to Nathaniel. I really chose my preposition very carefully.""","Denis Asselin finished his walk from Philadelphia to Boston on Thursday .

"Jobs expert Mike Rowe, host of CNN's new series ""Somebody's Gotta Do It,"" took a chance Wednesday. For a little more than an hour, Rowe allowed himself to be asked ANYTHING, by anyone. Rowe sat down for a Reddit Ask Me Anything online chat, where he dished about: . -- The job that disgusted him the most . -- What it's like working for CNN . -- How his fear of the Mob affected his decision to showcase a certain job . After more than 2,900 comments, here's the good stuff. Some of it has been edited for length. (For the full transcript, follow the permalinks.) 1. Forbidden jobs: . Q: ""What dirty jobs did you always want to do but the network or producers wouldn't let you do? (too dangerous, inappropriate, so on),"" asked SSJStarwind16. Rowe: ""The segments I was most interested in doing but found the most resistance around was that of a rendering facility. ... the Mob is still involved in a surprising number of rendering facilities. Why the Mob has such a rich history in garbage-related industries and rendering-related industries is a conversation beyond my pay grade. I only know how relieved I was to finally find a rendering outfit that was not owned or operated by the Cosa Nostra. ""That facility was in Northern California. And they were called North State Rendering. ""To this day, I'm impressed with how brave they were in their decision to let us provide our viewers with an unvarnished look at what it takes to turn a dead cow into several hundred pounds of chicken feed."" Permalink . 2. Shockingly awful jobs: . Q: ""What job shocked you the most by finding out how awful it really was?"" asked nomadbishop. Rowe: ""In the Coast Guard, buoy tenders are responsible for hoisting these giant steel contraptions out of the ocean, and refurbishing them. ""In this case, ""refurbishment"" means crawling into a woefully inadequate tube not much larger than the space taken up by your shoulders, and wiggling your way like a worm into the shadowy depths whereupon you begin to remove the barnacles and various other forms of nautical life with a stick or some other improvised tool."" Permalink . Later, AmerikanInfidel posted that he or she used to do that job, saying, ""Buoy guy here. Can concur. Once you start scraping that s**t off and things start crawling around you and dripping down your neck you have got to question the honesty of your recruiter."" Permalink . 3. His CNN job: . Q: ""How has the transition to CNN been? Also, what was the reason for the move?"" asked GoldenRy007. Rowe: ""The truth is, it's become very difficult to produce a show with no second takes, and no script, because the people in charge of putting them on the air would prefer to control them, in the same way an executive might be able to control an episode of 'The Big Bang Theory.' ""It occurred to me that networks like FOX and CNN were not just news outlets, but fundamentally, nonfiction outlets. ""CNN, in particular, was very interested in exploring alternative forms of programming, very similar to 'Dirty Jobs.' ""In short, they've been great to work with. ""And as long as headlines like Ebola, and ISIS, and terrorism, and natural disasters don't completely dominate the landscape, I think there will be room for 'Somebody's Gotta Do It' and other shows like it.""

"Demonstrators pack public squares. Flames shoot into the air. Tear gas sends crowds scrambling. Bodies are carried from the streets. Dramatic scenes are unfolding during anti-government protests in three disparate countries this week, on three different continents. The images are striking, and things are heating up quickly. What's happening on the ground? Here's a cheat-sheet guide to the protests in Ukraine, Venezuela and Thailand: . UKRAINE . What are the protesters' demands? Who's a better economic ally, Europe or Russia? That's the key issue at the heart of Ukraine's protests. Demonstrators want the government to forge closer ties with Europe and turn away from Russia. But the dispute is also about power. Many in the opposition have called for the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych and the ordering of new elections. And both on the streets and in parliament, they've also pushed to alter the government's overall power structure, feeling that too much of it rests with Yanukovych and not enough with parliament. Who's protesting? An opposition coalition has been leading the charge against Yanukovych and his allies. On CNN iReport, protesters and onlookers have shared more than 100 photos and videos of clashes between demonstrators and police. The nighttime images are especially striking -- figures are silhouetted against large bonfires set alight in the streets. When did the demonstrations start? In November, thousands spilled onto the streets after Yanukovych did a U-turn over a trade pact with the European Union that had been years in the making -- with Yanukovych favoring closer relations with Russia instead. What's the latest? Long-simmering tensions exploded anew in Ukraine on Tuesday as clashes between police and anti-government protesters left more than 25 people dead and the capital's central square on fire. A shaky truce agreed to late Wednesday disintegrated by the next morning, as gunfire erupted again in the square. At least 100 people have died and 500 have been injured since Thursday morning, the head of the protesters' medical service told CNN. The Ukrainian government has not released an updated figure, but the Interior Ministry said earlier that one police officer was among the dead. Foreign ministers from Germany, France and Poland met with Yanukovych on Thursday and are to meet with opposition leaders too. European foreign ministers convened an emergency meeting in Brussels, Belgium, where they are considering sanctions against Ukraine. VENEZUELA . What are the protesters' demands? Demonstrators are demanding better security, an end to goods shortages and protected freedom of speech. They blame Venezuela's government, led by President Nicolas Maduro, for those problems. Maduro and other officials blame the opposition for the country's security and economic problems. Who's protesting? Many demonstrators across the country are students. Prominent opposition politicians have also led protests and joined marches. Since February 13, more than 1,100 images have been uploaded to iReport, CNN's user-generated platform. Many of the videos and photos are gruesome and depict violent scenes between demonstrators and police. When did the demonstrations start? Nationwide student protests started this month. On February 12, the demonstrations drew global attention after three people were killed. What's the latest? As throngs of supporters chanted their support, opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez turned himself in to authorities Tuesday. Lopez remained in a military prison Thursday as the government pressed terrorism and murder charges against him, his wife said. Lopez has denied the charges, which are connected with violence during the protests. Maduro, meanwhile, has called members of the opposition fascists and compared them to an infection that needs to be cured. Officials have also accused the United States of plotting to destabilize the government. THAILAND . What are the protesters' demands? Protesters in Bangkok have been calling for months for the ouster of  Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, who they allege is a puppet of her billionaire brother, the deposed, exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Who's protesting? Opposition to Thaksin and Yingluck is strongest among the urban elites and middle class. That's why the demonstrations have been concentrated in Bangkok. The protesters want to replace Yingluck's government with an unelected ""people's council"" to see through electoral and political changes. Thailand residents and visitors have shared dozens of stories of unrest on CNN iReport over the past month. The latest approved photos show demonstrators sleeping in the streets in Bangkok as a form of peaceful protest. When did the demonstrations start? Protests began in November after Yingluck's government tried to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for her brother's return to the political fray. What's the latest? Deadly violence erupted in the heart of Bangkok on Tuesday as anti-government protesters clashed with police, and the country's anti-corruption commission filed charges against the Prime Minister.","In Ukraine, demonstrators demand closer ties with Europe, want President's ouster .

"For the first time, a computer program passed the Turing Test for artificial intelligence. A computer on Saturday was able to trick one third of a team of researchers convened by the University of Reading into believing it was human -- in this case a 13-year old boy named Eugene. The Turing Test, named for British mathematician Alan Turing, is often thought of as the benchmark test for true machine intelligence. Since he introduced it in 1950, thousands of scientific teams have tried to create something capable of passing, but none has succeeded. Until now. And that outcome means we need to start grappling with whether machines with artificial intelligence should be considered persons, as far as the law is concerned. In 1920, Karel Capek introduced the mainstream world to the concept of artificial people in his play ""Rossum's Universal Robots"" (the word robot comes from the Czech word for serf labor). Since then, society has been fascinated by the idea of a robot walking among us, or even crossing over into personhood like a modern-day Pinocchio. The fascination continues; just take a look at this year's box office. In the recent film ""Transcendence,"" Johnny Depp starred as a sentient machine. In the critically acclaimed ""Her,"" Joaquin Phoenix's character fell in love with an advanced operating system named Samantha. Coming attractions include more installments in the rebooted ""RoboCop"" franchise; ""Star Wars: Episode VII,"" with its universally lovable droids; and, of course, ""Terminator 5."" A question at the heart of all these movies is this: At what point does a computer move from property to personhood? Robotic legal personhood in the near future makes sense. Artificial intelligence is already part of our daily lives. Bots are selling stuff on eBay and Amazon, and semiautonomous agents are determining our eligibility for Medicare. Predator drones require less and less supervision, and robotic workers in factories have become more commonplace. Google is testing self-driving cars, and General Motors has announced that it expects semiautonomous vehicles to be on the road by 2020. When the robot messes up, as it inevitably will, who exactly is to blame? The programmer who sold the machine? The site owner who had nothing to do with the mechanical failure? The second party, who assumed the risk of dealing with the robot? What happens when a robotic car slams into another vehicle, or even just runs a red light? Liability is why some robots should be granted legal personhood. As a legal person, the robot could carry insurance purchased by its employer. As an autonomous actor, it could indemnify others from paying for its mistakes, giving the system a sense of fairness and ensuring commerce could proceed unchecked by the twin fears of financial ruin and of not being able to collect. We as a society have given robots power, and with that power should come the responsibility of personhood. From the practical legal perspective, robots could and should be people. As it turns out, they can already officially fool us into thinking that they are, which should only strengthen their case. The notion of personhood has expanded significantly, albeit slowly, over the last few thousand years. Throughout history, women, children and slaves have all at times been considered property rather than persons. The category of persons recognized in the courts has expanded to include entities and characters including natural persons aside from men (such as women, slaves, human aliens, illegitimate children and minors) as well as unnatural or juridical persons, such as corporations, labor unions, nursing homes, municipalities and government units. Legal personality makes no claim about morality, sentience or vitality. To be a legal person is to have the capability of possessing legal rights and duties within a certain legal system, such as the right to enter into contracts, own property, sue and be sued. Not all legal persons have the same rights and obligations, and some entities are only considered ""persons'"" for some matters and not others. Just last month, the Supreme Court heard arguments in the Hobby Lobby case about whether a corporation is person enough to ask for a religious exemption. New categories of personhood are matters of decision, not discovery. The establishment of personhood is an assessment made to grant an entity rights and obligations, regardless of how it looks and whether it could pass for human. To make the case for granting personhood to robots, it's not necessary to show that they can function as persons in all the ways that a ""person"" may be understood by a legal system. It's enough to show that they may be considered persons for a particular set of actions in a way that makes the most sense legally and logically.","Computer program passes the Turing Test for artificial intelligence for the first time .

"Adrianne Haslet-Davis' life as a dancer was shattered last year at the Boston Marathon bombings. She and her husband Adam, who had just returned from a tour in Afghanistan with the Air Force, were steps away from the second blast. ""I felt the direct impact and it immediately blew off (part of) my left foot,"" she said. Before Haslet-Davis could even see the damage the bomb had done, her husband's reaction confirmed her fears. ""I remember him picking up my foot and looking and just screaming a scream that you never want to hear a loved one scream,"" she recalled. Adam Davis also sustained injuries -- shrapnel wounds to both legs were causing blood loss -- but he knew it was his wife's much more traumatic injury that could quickly kill her. ""I took my belt off and put it around Adrianne's leg. At that point I remember thinking this is very ironic. For 4½ months, I had a real tourniquet on my arm every day ... in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""When did I need it? Back at home."" Minutes later, first responders rushed Haslet-Davis into an ambulance and raced to Boston Medical Center. While her life was saved by the heroic actions of her husband, emergency personnel and doctors, the damage to her foot was so severe that surgeons had no choice but to amputate. She woke up the next day in the hospital in a haze, with phantom pains in her foot. She believed it had been saved. Her mother had to deliver the heart-breaking news. ""She looked at me and said, 'Adrianne, you don't have a foot. Your foot is gone,' "" she said.  ""I just lost it. It was really hard to hear."" The loss of a limb would be agonizing for anyone but for Haslet-Davis, it was the end of her way of life. She is an award-winning ballroom dancer whose passion for dance is contagious. ""Dancing is the one thing I do that when I do it, I don't feel like I should be doing anything else ever. I feel so free,"" she said. Her dream was to continue teaching ballroom dancing in Boston and competing in higher levels of dance tournaments across the country. ""When she dances, I see her glow. I see her light up ... then all of a sudden, (to) have it removed in a split second is devastating,"" said Adam Davis. ""I knew that there was a chance that she'd never dance again."" 'I thought everybody had a bomb' From the early days of her recovery, Haslet-Davis was defiant towards her new life as an amputee.  Speaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper just a week after the bombings, she vowed that she would dance again. ""I feel like somebody has come along and said, 'Oh, we're not going to let you do that anymore,' "" she said. ""I'm going to prove them wrong."" Haslet-Davis agreed to allow CNN to follow her journey to recovery and film her everyday life over the past year.  She details her recovery on CNN's ""The Survivor Diaries"" on April 8 at 10 p.m. ET. Her video diaries portray a raw, honest and at times heart-breaking picture of a woman battling extreme physical and emotional challenges. ""The reality of knowing that someone tried to kill you and letting that sink in ... it's just been really difficult,"" she said in one video. ""I have gone through many, many stages, of not only PTSD, but also of mourning the loss of my leg,"" she said. ""I remember waking up many mornings and just bawling and just crying and just being so sad."" The mental scars, especially in the early months, were never far from the surface. ""Navigating the streets of Boston for the first time, it was really tough,"" said Haslet-Davis. ""I thought everybody had a bomb. I mean I hate even saying things like that out loud because it sounds crazy but ... I had horrible anxiety."" That's evident in one video that shows Haslet-Davis' reaction to a fireworks show outside the couple's apartment.  ""I thought we were going to die,"" she said. ""I hit the floor immediately and put my hands over my head and started screaming and crying and called 911."" Beyond the anguish she battled mentally, the physical challenges of walking and eventually dancing again were extreme. ""I was very uneducated about prosthetics and it was a huge surprise and complete, not only disappointment, but devastation that I couldn't just put on a prosthetic and just walk and go. I didn't know it would be so incredibly painful,"" she said. It would be months of intense physical therapy before Haslet-Davis trusted her leg enough to try dancing again. Her muscle memory from dancing as many as 60 hours a week before her amputation was still there, but her prosthetic didn't respond as her natural leg had. Unlike the repetitive motion of walking or running, the complicated and varied movements of ballroom dancing are nearly impossible on a standard prosthetic. A new start . Just as Haslet-Davis' frustration with dancing began to overwhelm her, she connected with the man that would eventually put her back on the dance floor. Dr. Hugh Herr is one of the world's leading creators of bionic prosthetic limbs as director of the Biomechatronics group at the MIT Media Lab. He is also an amputee, having lost both of his legs in an ice climbing accident as a teenager. After meeting Haslet-Davis, Herr pledged to help her recapture her dream. ""I really emotionally connect with Adrianne's mission to dance again. And I wanted do everything I could to help her achieve that goal,"" said Herr. But the doctor and his team had a massive challenge -- they'd have to create the world's first bionic leg designed specifically for dancing. ""We're going to measure everything about the dance -- the movements, the forces,"" said Herr. He and his team brought one of Haslet-Davis' fellow dancers into their lab and placed super sensitive sensors on her body while she danced some of Haslet-Davis' favorite dance steps. ""We have to use ... artificial type intelligence,"" he said.  ""Intelligence built into the bionic limb has to understand fundamentally the nature of the dance."" Video:  Meet Hugh Herr, creator of the most advanced bionic leg . Herr and his team spent months developing the bionic limb and when it was ready to be worn, Haslet-Davis spent countless hours in their lab testing it and giving them feedback. When she felt strong enough, she invited Anderson Cooper to MIT to show him how far she'd come. In just eight months since they first met, Haslet-Davis overcame seemingly overwhelming odds and made good on her promise to give Cooper a dance lesson. ""I had no doubt that Adrianne had the will to do it and would dance again,"" said Cooper. ""She was very kind in trying to help me dance. I think I need a lot more work than she does in that area."" Anderson Cooper on Adrianne's story . Beyond continued hard work to return to the level of dancing she attained before the bombing, Haslet-Davis has now become an advocate for other amputees. ""I feel really passionately about the rights of amputees as well as the advancements in prosthetics,"" she said. ""I know that the only thing that makes me disabled is not the fact that I don't have two feet, it's the fact that what I'm using isn't advanced enough to make me do the same thing that the person next to me with two feet can do."" Haslet-Davis sees her participation in this CNN documentary as a way to reach out to other amputees and help them through their own dark days. ""I know that I'm not inspired by the amputee that's standing on top of the mountain or the amputee that crossed the finish line. I'm inspired by the struggle and the journey it took to get there,"" she said. Perhaps Adrianne Haslet-Davis' biggest message is that she never wants to be pitied or to be called a victim of the people that carried out the Boston bombings. ""A victim ... means that I somehow belong to somebody or I'm suffering because of him and I'm not suffering. I'm thriving,"" she said. ""I am a survivor.""","Adrianne Haslet-Davis lost part of her leg in last year's Boston marathon bombings .

"Burmese pythons have been threatening Florida's ecosystem for years, so the state is turning to the public for help in the form of a hunting contest to cull the population. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission on Saturday launched the 2013 Python Challenge. ""We are hoping to gauge from the python challenge the effectiveness of using an incentive-based model as a tool to address this problem,"" says Florida Wildlife Commission spokeswoman Carli Segelson. A grand prize of $1,500 will be awarded to the person who kills the most pythons, and $1,000 will go to the person who bags the longest one. According to the rules, road kill will not be eligible. Participants paid a $25 registration fee and completed an online training course. The training focuses on safety while hunting pythons. ""It's very difficult to find these animals and we don't really have a good strategy on how to contain this population,"" said Linda Friar, spokeswoman for Everglades National Park. ""This is a pilot to see if it will gain public interest in areas that you can hunt so that they would be able to remove and capture these snakes."" The Burmese python is native to Southeast Asia and was first found in the Everglades in 1979, according to researchers at the University of Florida. These snakes were determined to be an established species in 2000. It is believed that the snakes were originally pets that found their way into Everglades National Park. The Everglades, known as the river of grass, is a vast area with a climate perfect for the pythons to hide and thrive. And thrive they do: The largest Burmese python ever found in Florida -- its 17 foot, 6-inch carcass weighed 164.5 pounds -- was harvested in the Everglades in August. Researchers at the University of Florida found 87 eggs inside the snake. Friar told CNN last year that it is believed ""tens of thousands"" of Burmese pythons live in the Everglades. The snakes prey on native wildlife such as the endangered Key Largo wood rat and the endangered wood stork. The largest prey, Friar told CNN, was a 76-pound deer that was found in the stomach of a 16-foot python a few months ago. Earlier this year, researchers at Virginia Tech University, Davidson College and the U.S. Geological Survey reported that populations of rabbits and foxes have disappeared and numbers of raccoons, opossums and bobcats have dropped as much as 99%. Last January, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service instituted a ban on the importation of Burmese pythons -- along with three other species of exotic snake -- and their eggs. The Python Challenge has laid out four specific areas where the snakes can be harvested, and the park is off-limits to the general public. ""The park is very restricted on what it can do as far as animal captures and removal,"" Friar said. The python problem has spread to other wildlife management areas in the state besides the Everglades. ""We're supportive of the state exploring various measures in order to reduce the populations outside the park,"" Friar said. In the end, she said, ""it will also reduce the population of the snakes that get into the park."" According to the rules of the contest, reducing the population means killing the snakes. ""We want to make sure this is done in a humane way,"" Segelson said. The competition's website lists several ways to kill a python ""in a humane manner that results in immediate loss of consciousness and destruction of the brain."" It suggests shooting the snake in the head with a firearm or decapitating it with a machete. Wildlife officials say the 2013 Python Challenge is not only about killing snakes. ""One of things that is very important to us is to educate the public about the Burmese python and how this species is impacting the state of Florida,"" Segelson said. ""We're hoping to inform people ... if they do have exotic pets that they understand the importance of not releasing them into the wild."" The contest ends at midnight on February 10.","The state of Florida has launch the month-long 2013 Python Challenge .

"China has no wine-making tradition but the country now uncorks more bottles of red than any other. It's home to a growing middle-class thirsty for new tastes, international vintners trying to win their share of the market and Chinese winemakers working to find their own identity. Here, four wine experts, who appear on the latest episode of CNN's On China show that airs this week, examine some of the myths that have grown up about wine drinking in China. Myth? Chinese don't know much about wine . Fongyee Walker, co-founder of Beijing-based Dragon Phoenix Wine Consulting, says that when she first started educating people about wine, her students were focused on a narrow selection of premium red wines. ""They talked about Bordeaux of course and some talked about Burgundy,"" she tells CNN's On China. ""Now I have students arrive in class and they say, 'Well I've heard about prosecco and I love drinking it.' Or 'I really like New Zealand sauvignon blanc, it's a very exciting drink, I love it in the summer.'"" ""The sustainable 'I love wine' section of the market is still small but we have an appreciable number,"" she says. Myth? China doesn't have the right conditions to produce good wine . Judy Chan, chief executive of Grace Vineyard in Shanxi province that produces 400,000 bottles of wine a year, says China is not an easy place to grow grapes, with summer rains and winter frosts. And in most grape-growing areas, vines have to be buried under the soil during winter. ""This restricts our growing season -- we usually bury the vine in November and unearth in early April -- and not to mention the cost incurred as a result,"" she says. What's more, she adds, given that China doesn't have a long wine-making tradition, it's hard to know which grape variety is best suited to each region. But despite these challenges, Chan is confident of her product. ""After 17 years of experiment, I think we can make very decent wine."" Myth? People don't drink the wine they buy . Historically, many Chinese didn't actually drink the wine they bought, says Simon Zhou, founder of wine distributor Ruby Red Fine Wine. Instead, bottles of premium Bordeaux costing hundreds if not thousands of dollars were intended to impress as lavish gifts but this custom has come under scrutiny as part of a government anti-corruption campaign. ""There was a lot of gift giving six, seven, 10 years ago,"" he says. ""Today, that market is not as important as it used to be."" More often, he says ""it's about friends, it's about getting together with a group of people to share the experience of wine."" Although he adds that it's still rare to find people who drink a glass of wine by themselves or a husband and wife sharing a bottle at home. Myth? Chinese like to mix their wine with cola . There's an often-shared notion that the Chinese wine drinker buys a bottle of Bordeaux and mixes it with Coca-Cola.  Is this fact or urban legend? Twenty years ago, it might have happened, says wine consultant Walker, but it's a thing of the past and Chinese palates are increasingly sophisticated. ""To be honest, if you look at most of the wine they were probably drinking 20 years ago, I'd mix it with coke,"" she says. Myth? China will never produce a truly top tier world class wine . Janice Robinson, wine writer for the Financial Times, says when she first visited China in 2002 the wine industry was in an ""embryonic state"" and local enthusiasts came up with just two names when she asked for recommendations. ""Now it would be closer to 200, I expect."" But she says she's never tasted a Chinese wine that she would term ""extraordinary."" ""I have opened Chinese wine at home just to share with friends who are curious,"" she says. ""But I haven't yet found a Chinese wine that would be worth, on its own merits, serving at my dinner table, I'm afraid.  But I'm sure it will happen.""","Wine experts examine some of the myths about wine drinking in China .

"The world's most powerful democracy and the world's most absolute monarchy have long been close, if unlikely, allies. They are bound together by common interests -- the free flow of oil and, more recently, fighting al Qaeda. That alliance was first sealed between President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Saudi King Adul Aziz on February 14, 1945, when they met on the deck of the USS Quincy as the American warship cruised in the Suez Canal. FDR and his advisors knew that oil, of which Saudi Arabia was well endowed, was a key component of America's economy. Indeed, Standard Oil of California had signed a farsighted deal a decade earlier giving it exclusive production rights in Saudi Arabia. Thomas Lippman, who has written authoritatively on U.S.-Saudi relations, writes that as result of the meeting on the Quincy, the American president gave the Saudi king a DC-3 airplane that was specially outfitted with a rotating throne that allowed the king always to face the holy site of Mecca while he was in the air. For his part, King Abdul Aziz so enjoyed his meals as the president's guest on board the Quincy that he surprised his host with an unusual demand: he wanted to take the Quincy's cook for himself.  FDR was able to diplomatically ward off this request. (The concept that human beings are not personal property came to the Saudi kingdom relatively late; slavery was only abolished there in 1962.) For more than six decades after that important meeting on the Quincy the Saudi-American relationship has largely worked well for both countries. Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil producer and sits on around a fifth of the world's proven oil reserves and therefore it can set oil prices by increasing or lowering oil production. Generally it has done so in ways that respect American interests. When the Saudis really needed the States following Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of their neighbor Kuwait, the United States sent a half a million troops to the Gulf to expel Saddam's forces. The news that 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudis certainly put something of a dent in the U.S.-Saudi alliance, but the George W. Bush administration had close ties to the Saudis and matters were soon smoothed over, particularly after 2003 when al Qaeda began staging attacks on Westerners and oil facilities in the Saudi kingdom, at which point the Saudis launched an effective crackdown on the group. Controversy stirs anew over Saudi textbooks with Obama set to visit . Yet today, the Saudi-American alliance has never been in worse shape. That is why on Friday President Barack Obama met with Saudi King Abdullah, one of the sons of King Abdul Aziz, in an attempt to patch things up. What went wrong? In recent months the normally hyper-discreet Saudis have gone on the record about their dissatisfactions with the Obama administration. In December, Prince Turki al-Faisal, the former Saudi intelligence chief and ambassador to Washington, took the highly unusual step of publicly criticizing the administration, ""We've seen several red lines put forward by the president, which went along and became pinkish as time grew, and eventually ended up completely white...When that kind of assurance comes from a leader of a country like the United States, we expect him to stand by it."" It's inconceivable that Prince Turki, whose brother is the Saudi foreign minister, would make these public comments without approval from the highest levels of the Saudi government. Why are the Saudis going public with their dissatisfaction with the Obama administration? The laundry list of Saudi complaints most recently is that the United States didn't make good on its ""red line"" threat to take action against the Bashar al Assad regime in Syria following its use of chemical weapons against its own population. Syria is a close ally of Saudi Arabia's archrival, Iran, and the Saudis are also growing apprehensive that the United States will not take a firm line on Iran's nuclear program -- which the Saudis see as an almost-existential threat -- now that the U.S.-Iranian relations have recently thawed. The Saudi were also puzzled by the fact that the Obama administration seemed willing to let a longtime U.S. ally, Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, be thrown overboard during the ""Arab Spring"" of early 2011. What did that say about other longtime U.S. allies in the region? (Interestingly, these list of gripes look quite similar to those of another powerful player in the Middle East -- Israel.) Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the powerful Saudi Minister of Interior, was in Washington last month. According to a senior Saudi official his discussions in Washington ahead of Obama's trip were all about Syria. Here Washington and Riyadh have a real common interest; preventing the rise of al Qaeda in Syria. Saudi Arabia made it a crime last month for its citizens to travel to fight in overseas conflicts such as the Syrian civil war. Those Saudis who have gone to fight in Syria often join al-Qaeda-aligned groups. Some 1,200 Saudis have traveled to Syria, of whom 220 have returned to the kingdom, according to the senior Saudi official. There is great concern in the kingdom about potential ""blowback"" caused by such militants who have obtained battlefield experience in Syria. Both the United States and Saudi Arabia have an interest in blocking al Qaeda's growth in Syria. Obama and King Abdullah met on Friday outside Riyadh. After the meeting, a senior US official said that the United States and Saudi Arabia remain ""very much aligned"" despite recent policy differences over issues like Iran.","U.S. has had alliance with Saudi Arabia since 1945; Obama met King Abudullah Friday .

"Condolences poured in to a Florida primate sanctuary Wednesday after it announced the death of Cheetah, a chimpanzee that the sanctuary said starred in the Tarzan movies during the 1930s. ""I grew up watching Tarzan and Cheetah from a boy,"" a man identifying himself as Thomas from England wrote on the Suncoast Primate Sanctuary's website. ""God bless you Cheetah. Now you and Tarzan are together again."" The chimpanzee died Saturday after suffering kidney failure the week before, the sanctuary foundation said on the site. He was roughly 80 years old, Debbie Cobb, the sanctuary's outreach director, told CNN affiliate WFLA. Cobb recalled Cheetah as an outgoing chimp who loved finger painting and watching football and who was soothed by Christian music, the station said. Several chimpanzees appeared in various Tarzan movies, many of which were popular in the 1930a and 1940s. The Florida primate sanctuary said its chimp appeared in the Tarzan moves from 1932 through 1934, according to WFLA. According to the website Tarzanmovieguide.com, ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" was released in 1932 and ""Tarzan and his Mate"" in 1934.  Both movies starred Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan. Weissmuller was the first speaking Tarzan, according to the Internet Movie Database website. He died in 1984. Weissmuller appeared in Tarzan movies through 1948, according to the online movie guide site, with other chimpanzees appearing in the role of Cheetah. Cheetah came to the primate sanctuary from Weissmuller's Florida estate around 1960, Cobb told WFLA. He was the most famous of the sanctuary's 15 chimpanzees. ""He was very compassionate,"" Cobb said. ""He could tell if I was having a good day or a bad day. He was always trying to get me to laugh if he thought I was having a bad day. He was very in tune to human feelings."" Cheetah was known for his ability to stand up and walk like a person, sanctuary volunteer Ron Priest told WFLA. Another distinguishing characteristic: ""When he didn't like somebody or something that was going on, he would pick up some poop and throw it at them,"" Priest said. ""He could get you at 30 feet with bars in between."" Still, Cobb told the station, ""He wasn't a chimp that caused a lot of problems."" Cheetah is not believed to have any children, Priest said. His age was advanced for a chimpanzee, Cobb told WFLA. In the wild, the average chimp survives 25 to 35 years, she said, and they can live 35 to 45 years in zoos. Another chimpanzee named Cheeta lives on a primate sanctuary in Southern California named C.H.E.E.T.A (Creative Habitats and Enrichment for Endangered and Threatened Apes).  The sanctuary's creator, Dan Westfall, said on its web site that he was saddened to hear of Cheetah's passing in Florida. He said he and others at the sanctuary ""send our deepest sympathies to our colleagues at Suncoast."" Westfall writes on the site that he was told Cheeta was one of the original chimps in the Tarzan movies during the 1930s and 1940s. However, when he began working with a writer on Cheeta's biography, research revealed ""that our Cheeta is unlikely to be as old as we'd thought, although he is clearly old,"" Westfall wrote. ""It is also difficult to determine which movies, if any, our Cheeta may have been in."" People from several countries offered condolences for Cheetah on the Florida sanctuary's site in several different languages. A few credited him with helping them develop a love for animals. ""Cheetah will remain forever remembered in history,"" someone in Malta wrote. ""This little man was almost human,"" another poster wrote. ""Some of the antics he got up to used to make me laugh when I was in my teens many years ago. Thanks Cheetah for all the good times you had and made us all laugh. You will be a star that will be always remembered. I am in my 60s now and grew up with you.""","Cheetah starred in the Tarzan films from 1932 through 1934, primate sanctuary says .

"Guardian Centers may be a place to practice how to respond to a disaster, but that doesn't mean real danger is nonexistent. When we headed over to see its mock subway station, complete with eight cars donated from Washington's Metro system, we were told we had a limited window to view it. The reason -- they were going to be pumping actual toxic gas into the building to simulate a chemical attack. As smoke rose from chunks of concrete representing an obliterated building, Chris Schaff put it this way: ""As soon as you come in here, the pretend goes away."" He's a fire and rescue battalion chief with Fairfax County, Virginia, and his words carry a lot of weight. His elite team of urban search and rescue operatives has been deployed to numerous disasters, including Hurricane Sandy, the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, and the 2010 Haiti quake. Luis Fernandez, a two-decades-plus veteran of disaster response, agreed the Perry, Georgia, facility passes muster. ""The temperature extremes, the building extremes, the noises, the environment, are incredibly lifelike,"" said Fernandez, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue chief of staff and.a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The brotherhood of Disaster City . From the aforementioned subway station, to a mock bridge with crushed cars, to a devastated structure made to look like the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, Guardian Centers' 830-acre site is designed to allow a variety of responders to do a variety of drills in one location. This kind of  ""doomsday Disneyland"" owes its vision to Geoff Burkart, a telecommunications executive who was in Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. During Katrina, he saw ""what was being done there, and what was not being done."" From there the idea was born, and a former Cold War missile plant became the location. The subway station is especially convincing, fashioned from an elongated building originally designed to be an assembly line for the weapons. Open for less than two years, the Centers facility has changed the game for disaster response training. Clients can tell Burkart's team what their specific needs are. If it's a group from the Pacific Northwest, they can request the ground be saturated to simulate the region's heavy rainfall. Many agencies have ""script writers"" that work with Guardian Centers on specifications, from smoke to rebar. ""We're primarily just a tool, and we want to be the best tool,"" Burkart said. He doesn't want to slight government training facilities but points out the advantages to being privately run. ""We can adapt and provide everything the client needs almost on demand,"" he said. And by being able to provide a number of different training types in one place, Burkart says, he's saving the taxpayers money. Still, the process to create such scenarios takes time. A recent weeklong earthquake response drill for FEMA and the U.S. Agency for International Development took months to plan, according to spokespeople. And things must always be changed up. A pair of dog handlers from a New Mexico search and rescue team pointed out that the animals are smart enough to remember where the holes in the rubble are. As for Burkart, he hopes his vision will extend well beyond the rolling hills of central Georgia. ""If we can make this entire campus successful, we would like to put one of these in (each of) the four corners of the United States,"" he said.","Guardian Centers is an 830-acre disaster response training facility in Georgia .

"(CNET) -- Republican politicians on Thursday called for a sweeping new federal law that would require all Internet providers and operators of millions of Wi-Fi access points, even hotels, local coffee shops, and home users, to keep records about users for two years to aid police investigations. U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, supporter of a bill that would require Internet user records to be saved for police. The legislation, which echoes a measure proposed by one of their Democratic colleagues three years ago, would impose unprecedented data retention requirements on a broad swath of Internet access providers and is certain to draw fire from businesses and privacy advocates. ""While the Internet has generated many positive changes in the way we communicate and do business, its limitless nature offers anonymity that has opened the door to criminals looking to harm innocent children,"" U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said at a press conference on Thursday. ""Keeping our children safe requires cooperation on the local, state, federal, and family level."" Joining Cornyn was Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, and Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who said such a measure would let ""law enforcement stay ahead of the criminals."" Two bills have been introduced so far--S.436 in the Senate and H.R.1076 in the House. Each of the companion bills is titled ""Internet Stopping Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Today's Youth Act,"" or Internet Safety Act. Each contains the same language: ""A provider of an electronic communication service or remote computing service shall retain for a period of at least two years all records or other information pertaining to the identity of a user of a temporarily assigned network address the service assigns to that user."" Translated, the Internet Safety Act applies not just to AT&T, Comcast, Verizon, and so on--but also to the tens of millions of homes with Wi-Fi access points or wired routers that use the standard method of dynamically assigning temporary addresses. (That method is called Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP.) ""Everyone has to keep such information,"" says Albert Gidari, a partner at the Perkins Coie law firm in Seattle who specializes in this area of electronic privacy law. The legal definition of electronic communication service is ""any service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications."" The U.S. Justice Department's position is that any service ""that provides others with means of communicating electronically"" qualifies. That sweeps in not just public Wi-Fi access points, but password-protected ones too, and applies to individuals, small businesses, large corporations, libraries, schools, universities, and even government agencies. Voice over IP services may be covered too. Under the Internet Safety Act, all of those would have to keep logs for at least two years. It ""covers every employer that uses DHCP for its network,"" Gidari said. ""It covers Aircell on airplanes-- hose little pico cells will have to store a lot of data for those in-the-air Internet users."" In the Bush administration, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales had called for a very similar proposal, saying that subscriber information and network data should be logged for two years. Until Gonzales' remarks in 2006, the Bush administration had generally opposed laws requiring data retention, saying it had ""serious reservations"" about them. But after the European Parliament approved such a requirement for Internet, telephone and VoIP providers, top administration officials began talking about the practice more favorably. After Gonzales left the Justice Department, the political will for data retention legislation seemed to ebb for a time, but then FBI Director Robert Mueller resumed lobbying efforts last spring. This tends to be a bipartisan sentiment: Attorney General Eric Holder, a Democrat, said in 1999 that ""certain data must be retained by ISPs for reasonable periods of time so that it can be accessible to law enforcement."" Rep. John Conyers, the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said that FBI proposals for data retention legislation ""would be most welcome."" Smith, who sponsored the House version of the Internet Safety Act, had previously introduced a one-year requirement as part of a law-and-order agenda in 2007. A 1996 federal law called the Electronic Communication Transactional Records Act regulates data preservation. It requires Internet providers to retain any ""record"" in their possession for 90 days ""upon the request of a governmental entity."" Because Internet addresses remain a relatively scarce commodity, ISPs tend to allocate them to customers from a pool based on whether a computer is in use at the time. (Two standard techniques used are the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet.) In addition, Internet providers are required by another federal law to report child pornography sightings to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which is in turn charged with forwarding that report to the appropriate police agency. The Internet Safety Act is broader than just data retention. Other portions add criminal penalties to other child pornography-related offenses, increase penalties for sexual exploitation of minors, and give the FBI an extra $30 million for the ""Innocent Images National Initiative."" © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc.

"A canoe glides through South Florida's endless maze of freshwater ways and emerges from a thicket of sawgrass into the saltwater of Florida Bay. Behind it are alligators, snakes and endangered Florida panthers. Ahead are crocodiles, manatees, wading birds and far beyond -- the Gulf of Mexico. Everglades National Park was established as a national park in 1947 and consists of nearly 2,400 square miles. Often referred to as a swamp, the Everglades' biggest water sources, approximately 60 inches of rain per year and overflow from Lake Okeechobee, help make it a southwestwardly flowing river running through the third largest national park in the lower 48 states. Park stats: Everglades National Park has averaged almost 950,000 visitors since 2008. In 2012, it welcomed more than 1 million visitors for the first time since 2007. The location: Everglades National Park spans three counties. The park's main road entrance is in Homestead, which allows easy access to the Royal Palm and Flamingo areas. The Shark Valley entrance is in Miami and the Gulf Coast entrance is in Everglades City. There also is water access via coastal boundaries and waterways. If you go: Admission is $10 per vehicle and $5 for hikers, motorcyclists and cyclists. Passes are valid for seven days. There are four park visitor centers located at the main entrance, Flamingo, Shark Valley and Gulf Coast. The park is open year-round, but be sure to check the website as some entrances close seasonally or at night. South Florida is generally dry during the winter, which is when the park offers the most access and the widest range of activities. Meet our ranger: Sabrina Diaz, supervisory park ranger at Everglades National Park, grew up in suburban Montreal, Canada. She always loved being outdoors, but was terrified of wildlife until a visit to Sea World. ""I wanted to be the girl who gets thrown off Shamu,"" she says. Diaz studied ecology in college at Vanier College in Quebec and afterwards taught environmental education. A romantic encounter during an internship rehabilitating birds at the Florida Keys Wild Bird Center led her to Everglades and a 2001 seasonal interpretative ranger position. Diaz enjoyed Everglades so much that she continued to work as a seasonal ranger for seven years, living in places such as Kings Canyon National Park, Yellowstone National Park and Katmai National Park. In the meantime, she married Shane Harrington, the man she met at Florida Keys, on December 6, 2008 -- the 61st anniversary of the Everglades' dedication. ""We had both fallen in love -- not only with each other, but also with the national parks,"" she says. ""We both decided to go at it together."" Her first permanent position came in 2009 at Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site south of Asheville, North Carolina. In 2012, she returned to Everglades. Shane works as a park ranger in nearby Biscayne National Park and the couple now has an 18-month-old daughter, Sierra Harrington. ""It's a park that is beautiful in a way that is different from other national parks,"" she says. ""It almost grows on you. There are so many mixtures of tropical and temperate plants and animals."" For a day trip, don't miss: Drive the 36-mile main road from Royal Palm to Flamingo. Diaz says there are several boardwalks along the way that are easily accessible and offer 10- to 15-minute walks into the wilderness. ""There are lots of unique habitats that are dependent on the small changes in elevation,"" she says. ""Most people think South Florida is perfectly flat. It could be a foot (difference) but that means a different habitat -- tropical, hardwood hammock, cypress domes -- all the way down to the salty waters of Florida Bay."" Favorite less-traveled spot: Snake Bight in Florida Bay. Diaz says Snake Bight is a ""bay within a bay"" where thousands of multi-colored wading birds congregate. ""It is a water park,"" she says. ""The best way to experience it is by boat."" Favorite spot to view wildlife: Anhinga Trail. Diaz says the water is lower during the winter, so wildlife congregates in the deeper waters near the trail. It's a great place to see birds, alligators and fish. ""It's really amazing for its biodiversity,"" she says. Most magical moment in the park: In 2001, a flock of birds flew over her kayak while she watched the sunset in Flamingo Bay. ""There was a loud noise from behind me and I couldn't turn around,"" she says. ""They came in waves. Dozens of tropical birds flying back to their roosting areas."" Funniest moment in the park: Fish jumping out of the water and into canoes as she led a six-boat tour in 2002. ""We must have spooked a school of fish,"" she says. ""Dozens of fish began jumping in a frenzy that lasted about eight seconds. It was such a quiet moment and then we were scrambling to flip them back in the water."" A ranger's request: Don't feed the wildlife, especially alligators and crocodiles. Diaz says crocodiles have a grayish color, V-shaped snout and usually prefer saltwater. Alligators, she says, are blacker in color, have a U-shaped snout and prefer freshwater. ""If you feed them, they will (begin to) assume people mean food,"" she says. ""That can lead to negative interactions in the future."" Another park she'd like to visit:  Redwood National Park in California. ""I have a love affair with giant trees,"" she says. ""I think it would be amazing to be in a forest with trees that are 300 feet tall."" What national park would you like to visit?

"Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska announced Tuesday that he will not run for re-election next year. Nelson, 70, said in a statement that it was time to ""step away from elective office, spend more time with my family, and look for ways to serve our state and nation."" ""Simply put: It is time to move on,"" Nelson said in the statement. Despite his record as a conservative Democrat who sometimes voted against his party, Nelson had been considered a top target of Republicans heading into the 2012 elections. A former two-term governor of Nebraska, Nelson narrowly won election to the Senate in 2000 and easily won re-election in 2006. His departure increases the difficulty for Democrats to retain their Senate majority next year. Democrats currently have a 53-47 margin in the Senate, including two independents who caucus with them. In the 2012 elections, 23 of the 33 seats up for grabs are currently held by Democrats and the two independents. So far, six other Democratic senators and two Republicans have announced they will retire instead of running for re-election next year. A Senate Democratic leadership aide, speaking on condition of not being identified, told CNN that party officials are reaching out to former Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey to possibly run for Nelson's seat. Kerrey, 68, is a Medal of Honor winner from the Vietnam War who, like Nelson, served as both a Democratic governor and senator. Nelson was known for looking out for his state's interests, especially on agriculture issues. He sided with Republicans on some high-profile issues, opposing the Supreme Court nomination of Elena Kagan and a climate-change measure pushed by the White House and Democrats. President Barack Obama commended Nelson for working with both parties during his career, saying in a statement it was ""a trait far too often overlooked in today's politics."" Jim Manley, the former long-time spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Nelson was often a ""thorn in Harry Reid's side."" However, Manley said Reid ""always respected the fact that Nelson was trying to do what was best for Nebraska."" According to the Senate Democratic leadership aide, Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, tried to convince Nelson to stay in Congress after Nelson told a local newspaper a few weeks ago he was still deciding on whether to run. ""Over the last several weeks, there were intense conversations with Reid and Schumer trying to make Nelson understand how needed he was and how valued he is as a member of the caucus,"" the Senate aide said. ""Ultimately they understood that this is a personal decision."" A Democratic strategist who spoke on condition of not being identified characterized Nelson's decision as disloyal to the party. ""He typically takes the easy way out,"" the strategist said. ""The party has stood by him,  but when the going gets tough, he abandons the party."" In his statement, Nelson called for ""those who will follow in my footsteps to look for common ground and to work together in bipartisan ways to do what's best for the country, not just one political party."" ""Public office is a place for public service, not personal profit,"" Nelson's statement said. ""It's about promoting the common good, not the agenda of the radical right or the radical left.  It's about fairness for all, not privileges for the few. And, it's about protecting the rights of individuals, even if it angers the majority.  I hope and believe I have fulfilled these principles to the best of my ability.""","Party officials are reaching out to former Sen. Bob Kerrey regarding Nelson's seat .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt braced for a ""march of millions"" in anti-government protests Tuesday as embattled President Hosni Mubarak tried to throw up literal and figurative roadblocks in the way of demonstrators calling for his ouster. Major demonstrations are planned for Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, the latest in a series of rallies that began a week ago. Protesters have defied orders for a curfew, and the country's powerful military announced Monday that it would not open fire on peaceful demonstrators. A leading opposition figure told CNN that the United States needs to be ready to ""let go of Mubarak,"" a longtime ally. ""You shouldn't be behind the curve, and you need to start building confidence with the people, and not with the people who are smothering the people,"" Mohamed ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Mubarak's newly appointed vice president, longtime intelligence chief Omar Suleiman, announced Monday that he had begun discussing reform with opposition parties. Speaking on the state television network, Suleiman said a reform package should be drawn up ""expeditiously."" ""The other parties will also have a role to play, which will lead to real political reform,"" Suleiman said. But there were no details of what proposals might be on the table, nor was there any immediate reaction from opposition figures or any indication of which parties were taking part. And at the same time, the government has shut down the country's rail network, posted troops at key locations, closed banks and schools and pulled the plug on mobile phone and internet service ahead of Tuesday's protests. Mubarak has ruled Egypt for nearly 30 years under a sweeping emergency decree, imposed after the 1981 assassination of his predecessor, Anwar Sadat. A wave of protests against his regime erupted following the uprising in Tunisia that ousted its longtime strongman January 14, and Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa -- Mubarak's former foreign minister -- called Monday for a peaceful transition of power ""from an era to the other,"" the French news agency AFP reported. Egypt's military announced Monday evening that it recognized ""the legitimate demands of the honest citizens"" and would not open fire on peaceful protesters. ""The presence of the armed forces in the Egyptian streets is for your benefit to protect your safety and peace,"" an unnamed spokesman announced on state television Monday night. ""Your armed forces will not use violence against this great people, who have always played a significant role in every moment of Egypt's great history."" And human rights activist and blogger Ramy Raoof told CNN's ""Parker Spitzer"" that troops are mingling with demonstrators in Cairo's Tahrir Square. ""There is no aggressive behavior from the army toward the peaceful assemblies,"" he said early Tuesday. ""We hope that within a few hours, the same also will happen. We hope the army will not escalate violence against us."" Though Mubarak has given no indication that he will bow to demands for his ouster, he fired his Cabinet on Saturday, and his designation of Suleiman as vice president marks the first time he has filled that post since he came to power in 1981. Monday, Mubarak swore in Mahmoud Wagdy as the new interior minister to replace Habib el-Adly, who has been criticized by protesters because of police actions. Others sworn in on Monday were Finance Minister Samir Radwan, a former economist at the International Labor Organization, and Health Minister Ahmed Hosni Farid. Radwan told CNN's ""Quest Means Business"" that his priority is ""to show that this is a government that responds to the demands -- the fair demands, I would say -- of the people in Tahrir Square."" ""We need to use public expenditure to achieve some sort of social justice and a better distribution of the fruits of growth, as to the bottom 40% of this country,"" Radwan said. At the same time, he said, Egypt shouldn't sacrifice economic reforms and gains ""that enabled it to stand the storm of two successive crises -- the food crisis and the financial crisis."" State television reported Monday that the crisis has cost the country an estimated 69 billion Egyptian pounds (nearly $12 billion) and set its economy back six months. Meanwhile, there are international indications that the world could accept a changed Egypt without Mubarak. In Washington, U.S. officials have been calling for an ""orderly transition"" that will include free elections in September, when Mubarak's current term expires. ""The United States government does not determine who's on the ballot,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters. ""The question is whether or not those elections are going to be free and fair. That's what we would weigh in on and weigh in on strongly."" While it was widely believed Mubarak was grooming his son, Gamal, as his successor, that plan now has been complicated by demands for democracy. ElBaradei is one of several opposition figures whose names surface when protesters talk about possible future leaders of Egypt. Another possibility is Moussa, a veteran diplomat who was Mubarak's foreign minister until 2001. But several opposition movements have been represented on the streets in the demonstrations, and Raoof said, ""There is no leader for the revolution."" ""There is no political group leading the people. There is no one leading the people. People are going in a very organic way ... people are just doing it."" Mounir Fakhry Abdel Nour, secretary-general of the Wafd Party, told CNN the group's followers have been ""extremely active."" In Alexandria, an armored personnel carrier fired warning shots Monday as about 2,000 to 3,000 people gathered. The shots were seen as an apparent effort to intimidate protesters near a hotel.","NEW: Egypt tries to cut off travel, communications ahead of new rallies .

"Strict building codes and the preparedness of millions of Chileans who live along an arc of volcanoes and fault lines likely kept the death toll -- only six by Wednesday afternoon -- low after an 8.2-magnitude earthquake rumbled offshore and prompted a tsunami, observers said. Officials said four of those whose deaths were blamed on the quake late Tuesday that triggered landslides, power outages, and a tsunami suffered heart attacks, while two others were crushed. ""They're a seismically active region of the world and they are very good at implementing their building codes similar to California,"" John Bellini, a Denver-based geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey told CNN on Wednesday. He added, ""Because of that, you would see less damage than in other places that have poorer building codes .... that's probably one of the reasons there haven't been as many casualties as there could have been from a magnitude earthquake of this size."" Nearly 928,000 people were evacuated, said Ricardo Toro, director of Chile's office of national emergency. More than 2,500 homes sustained serious structural damage in the region around the northern port city of Iquique, the mayor of Alto Hospicio, Ramon Galleguillos, told reporters. Most of the homes were built with poor workmanship through government subsidies, Galleguillos said. Alto Hospicio is about a mile from Iquique, 60 miles southeast from the epicenter of the quake. A 7.6-magnitude aftershock struck the region late Wednesday. There was no immediate word on damage or injuries. Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, who toured the region Wednesday, praised local authorities for responding in an ""exemplary manner"" to a powerful earthquake and the tsunami that followed. ""This is a great example to all of us that when we work together in an adequate manner and we when we follow the plans that have been established in the region, we work well,"" Bachelet said. Chile is in one of the most earthquake-prone regions in the world. The country sits on an arc of volcanoes and fault lines circling the Pacific Ocean known as the ""Ring of Fire,"" according to Mark Simons, a geophysicist at Caltech in Pasadena, California. This area sees frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Since 1973, Chile has had more than a dozen quakes of magnitude-7.0 and above. Simons said Tuesday's quake occurred as the fault line along Chile's coast has constantly shifted in the last 140 years. In recent weeks, this area has seen a cluster of activity -- something like 50 to 100 smaller quakes. Then, late last month, a 6.7- and a 6.1-magnitude quake struck. The keys to surviving the big ones . Chile has over the years implemented strict building codes and rigorous evacuation plans, experts said. ""People are more familiar with them,"" Bellini said of the temblors. ""They, in general, know what to do as part of their daily lives, plus the building codes are fairly well-enforced in Chile. It's in their culture."" In February 2010, about 500 people died when an 8.8-magnitude earthquake hit. That quake was so violent, it moved one whole Chilean city about 10 feet west. One month earlier, the importance of strict building codes was underscored when Port-au-Prince, Haiti, was hit by a magnitude-7.0 earthquake that leveled 70% of the Haitian capital's structures and killed at least 230,000 people. ""That's actually a perfect example of the differences in building codes and enforcement in two different regions,"" Bellini said. ""Any place that has a magnitude 7 or an 8 is going to have some kind of damage. However, the building codes play a large part in the damage and destruction that is seen, as well as the casualty level. Population density plays an important part as well -- but the building codes are really what can save lives in areas that have large earthquakes."" In a 2011 report, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction credited Chile's ""strict building codes"" with playing ""a large part in protecting people."" ""The key to surviving high magnitude quakes is to live and work in seismically safe buildings, while being aware of how nature around us can also change,"" Margareta Wahlstrom, U.N. special representative of the secretary-general for disaster risk reduction, said in the report. The report found that Haiti's quake, which struck closer to the surface than in Chile, was ""no match for the homes and buildings."" ""In Haiti, in addition to [lack of strict] building codes, you have a population that doesn't have a regular historical experience of large quakes like this,"" Bellini said. ""Last time there was a quake in Haiti that size was 100 plus years ago and they don't have large regular seismic activity plus the building codes are not there."" He added, ""In Chile, they're better prepared. Whether it's in their mind every single moment of the day, I'm sure it's not. But in general, their infrastructure and their population is much more prepared for it."" Steven Godby, an expert in disaster management at Nottingham Trent University in England, praised the Chile's disaster preparedness, saying an estimated 500,000 people participated in a drill in May 2012 in the coastal region of Valparaiso. ""The government of Chile has been working hard to improve the awareness of people living along the coast to the threat from tsunamis and on what to do if one is approaching,"" Godby said in a statement. ""Several tsunami drills have taken place since the tsunami that killed an estimated 500[-plus] Chileans in February 2010 and recent earthquakes in the region have helped to keep the threat firmly in people's minds."" Chile's big quake is not California's fault, scientists say . Inmates turn themselves in after temblor . In Chile on Tuesday, landslides damaged roads in some regions. Power and phone outages were reported in others. The tsunami following the quake was similar to ""high tide,"" Galleguillos added. Bachelet huddled with regional authorities as images broadcast from the affected region showed deep cracks across paved roads and a crumpled coastline strewn with beached boats. Bachelet said Chile faced the ""first emergency hours very well"" and Defense Minister Jorge Burgos said things were calm on Wednesday. He said the military had been dispatched throughout the quake zone to ensure safety. Some 300 relief personnel were deployed in Iquique, which has a population of more than 200,000, Burgos said. Of 293 inmates who escaped from prison in Iquique, 131 had turned themselves in voluntarily. Although the temblor was powerful, geologists say an even larger quake could be lurking. ""This magnitude, 8.2, is not the large earthquake that we were expecting in this area,"" said Simons. ""We're expecting a potentially even larger earthquake."" It could be tomorrow.

"A leading Saudi cleric warned women who drive cars could cause damage to their ovaries and pelvises and that they are at risk of having children born with ""clinical problems."" Sheikh Saleh Al-Loheidan's widely derided remarks have gone viral as activists claim a website urging women to defy their country's driving ban has been blocked in Saudi Arabia. ""If a woman drives a car,"" Al-Loheidan told Saudi news website sabq.org in an interview, ""it could have a negative physiological impact ... Medical studies show that it would automatically affect a woman's ovaries and that it pushes the pelvis upward."" Explained Al-Loheidan, ""We find that for women who continuously drive cars, their children are born with varying degrees of clinical problems."" The controversial comments, published Friday, were widely interpreted throughout Saudi Arabia as an attempt to discourage women in the country from joining a popular online movement urging them to stage a demonstration by driving cars on October 26. ""This is his answer to the campaign,"" Saudi women's rights activist Aziza Yousef told CNN. ""But it is an individual opinion. The clerical establishment is not behind this."" Added Yousef: ""He's making a fool of himself. He shouldn't touch this field at all -- the medical field is not his field at all."" Mai Al-Swayan, who was one of the first Saudi women to sign the online petition, called the comments ""ridiculous: "" and added, ""I am really disappointed. How could somebody ever make such a statement?"" Al-Loheidan's words have been ridiculed mercilessly via social media since they were first reported. An Arabic Twitter hashtag called ""#WomensDrivingAffectsOvariesAndPelvises"" was quickly created to make fun of Al-Loheidan -- underscoring just how widely the call for Saudi women to defy the driving ban has resonated thus far. And while numerous conservative voices have supported Al-Loheidan, many Saudis believe this was an extremely clumsy way of trying to counter the popularity of the October 26 campaign. ""I don't think it will harm the campaign -- on the contrary, it will make it stronger,"" said Saudi columnist and author Abdullah Al-Alami. Since it published online over a week ago, a petition on the website www.oct26driving.com has garnered more than 12,000 signatures from those asking authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to lift a de facto ban than prohibits women from driving. ""There is no justification for the Saudi government to prohibit adult women citizens who are capable of driving cars from doing so,"" reads part of the petition. No traffic law specifically prohibits women from driving in Saudi Arabia, but religious edicts there are often interpreted to mean women are not allowed to operate a vehicle. The new petition also urges the Saudi government to present ""to the citizens a valid and legal justification"" for the ban, demanding authorities should not simply blame it on ""societal consensus."" Many supporters of the campaign expressed dismay when reporting the website could no longer be accessed throughout the Kingdom as of Saturday. A post on the Oct26driving.com website read, ""Society wanting the ban to be lifted is apparently such a threat that the page petitioning the government to lift the ban has been blocked from within Saudi."" Al Alami wondered if the numerous conservatives opposed to women being granted the right to drive may have asked for the site to be blocked. Still, Al-Alami said he isn't too concerned. ""The message has been delivered,"" said Al-Alami. ""This is a battle we must fight. There is no U-turn."" CNN was unable to reach various Saudi Ministries for comment. The issue of women driving in the conservative kingdom has long been a contentious one. And while such demonstrations are extremely rare, they have been staged at least twice before. In June 2011, dozens of women across Saudi Arabia participated in the ""Women2Drive"" campaign by driving throughout the streets of their cities. In 1991, a group of 47 women drove through the country's capital city, Riyadh. After being arrested, many were further punished by being banned from travel and suspended from their workplaces. In addition to prohibiting driving, the country's strict and compulsory guardianship system also prevents women from opening bank accounts, working, traveling and going to school without the express permission of their male guardian. Saudi Arabia has been moving toward change under its current ruler, King Abdullah, who is considered a cautious reformer and proponent of women's rights. In January, he appointed 30 women to the Shura Council, the first time women had been chosen for the country's top consultative body. In 2011, he announced that women can run for office and vote in local elections in 2015, and in 2009, he appointed Saudi Arabia's first female deputy minister.","Saudi cleric claims that driving affects ""a woman's ovaries and that it pushes the pelvis upward""

"Iranian riot police swarmed a major bazaar Wednesday in Tehran as demonstrators launched protests against firebrand President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, blaming him for plummeting currency that's leaving families across the country struggling. A day after Ahmadinejad acknowledged that his country is taking a hit, and placed the blame largely on ""the enemy's"" sanctions, crowds of protesters also took to the streets in another commercial area in the capital, shopkeepers said. They chanted slogans slamming Ahmadinejad's regime and complained about the high prices of goods and food. Riot police dispersed the crowd, a shopkeeper said. The semi-official Mehr news agency reported two European tourists and some ""agitators"" were arrested by security forces. The Europeans violated Iranian law by gathering information about the protests, it said. The country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, echoed Ahmadinejad's position Wednesday, saying that growing pressures are mainly aimed at making his country surrender, ""but the Iranian nation has and will never surrender to pressures and this has made the enemy furious,"" the semi-official FARS news agency reported. The United States and European Union have imposed numerous sanctions aimed at pressuring Tehran into sitting down for international negotiations on its nuclear program. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the growing protests show that ""clearly the Iranian people are demanding better from their government and speaking out against the gross mismanagement of the economy and the situation in the country."" The United States is ""watching the situation very closely,"" she said. The ""sanctions that the international community has put on the government as a result of its lack of forthcomingness on its nuclear program are being felt on the ground,"" she said. Ahmadinejad, in a speech Tuesday, insisted the sanctions hurt the people, not the government.  He said the country's economy ""has become a tool for psychological warfare."" The rial's value was cut in half from September of last year through last month, the Congressional Research Service said in a report.  It has fallen even further since, including a sharp nosedive this week, reaching historic lows against the value of the dollar. At the main bazaar in central Tehran, some protesters used boxes and tires to start fires, according to a merchant who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons. Iran's president sits down with Piers Morgan . But Mehr quoted the head of the bazaar's merchant's association as saying that officials had observed ""suspicious"" activity and identified people around the market who were from ""outside the bazaar community."" The bazaar was closed for safety reasons, Mehr reported. Dozens of police on motorcycles responded to the scene, and dozens more were on foot. As the police were surrounding the bazaar, the semi-official Iranian Labor News Agency carried a quote from police official Col. Khalil Helali saying that based on his information, ""a limited number of people headed towards the bazaar and had chanted slogans."" Helali later told Mehr that he had no indication the bazaar was closed. Helali is chief of Tehran's Business Locations Police, which oversees workplaces. Police also gathered in two major squares -- Ferdosi and Vali Asr -- although no demonstrations were immediately reported in those spots. Ahmadinejad: 'I'm quite popular' In a speech Wednesday, Ahmadinejad also said part of the problem plaguing the country's currency is ""internal."" He blamed ""22 ringleaders"" who the country's intelligence services have determined are causing tensions and manipulating currency. The president gave no details.  But people who trade currency illegally have been increasingly concerned about a crackdown by Iranian forces. Months ago, an Iranian man told CNN that with the country's economic downfall, the only way for his sons to live a decent life was to fall in with influential people or make shady business deals -- such as trading foreign currency on the black market. But Ahmadinejad focused the majority of his remarks on the United States and the West. U.S.: Iran currency woes show sanctions working . ""There is a hidden war, a very pervasive and heavy warfare that is happening across the world directed towards Iran,"" he said. The ""enemy"" has ""succeeded in reducing the sale of our oil to an extent, but God willing, we will fill it up,"" he insisted. Amadinejad tells U.N. Iran is threatened . The price of a popular bread called barbari has gone from about 1,000 rials each to about 5,000 rials amid the increasing sanctions.  A local baker told CNN the cost will likely skyrocket further.  The wheat used to make the bread is imported. Feta cheese cost 50,000 rials per kilogram in March.  The price has since tripled.  Meat that cost up to 190,000 rials per kilogram then has doubled in price. Several Iranians told CNN Wednesday about the financial struggles they're facing.  They spoke anonymously for security reasons. ""The prices are amazing,"" said an Iranian entrepreneur, adding,  ""It's crazy, it's so high."" ""People can't make sense out of this,"" she added.  ""And they don't know what's going to happen next."" A taxi driver told CNN, ""I've been under so much stress lately that I'm getting migraine headaches. I'm worried about my future, my daughter's future."" An auto parts maker insisted that ""nobody is buying less or eating less so far,"" and that shops don't seem to have shortages. But a businessman said, ""If you go into a shop, you can probably not buy anything. They're not going to sell you anything. If (the shop owner) is prepared to sell it to you he will charge you a lot more than it was two days ago.  And when you ask him why, he'll tell you, 'I have no idea what I'll have to pay to bring this back.'"" ""Nobody knows whether this is for real, whether this is going to stay here,"" he added.  ""And this uncertainty is causing a lot of panic."" Mark Dubowitz, an analyst with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, says the sanctions ""are designed to put sufficient pressure on the average Iranian,"" which could help trigger an uprising against the government -- or at least cause leaders to fear one. ""Sanctions are a form of economic warfare,"" he said. Though some sanctions against Iran have existed for decades, ""We've seen only 10 months of what I would call significant and severe economic pressure,"" Dubowitz said. But there's no evidence the sanctions have compelled the Iranian government to change its nuclear stance, analysts say. Ahmadinejad, in his speech Wednesday, denied suggestions that the measures could work. ""They lie when they say sanctions are pressure on the government,"" he insisted, adding that sanctions ""are always a pressure on nations"" -- meaning average citizens. ""It's a rock that the enemy has thrown. So what we should do? We should pick up the rock and throw it at them."" Anthony H. Cordesman, national security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said sanctions must be ""large scale and consistent"" over time to be effective. It's not possible to predict whether sanctions will change the regime, Cordesman said. ""This is a duel and you find out just how effective you are over time."" Trita Parsi, founder and president of the National Iranian American Council, said so far there is no sign of a shift in the government's nuclear program. ""If Iran were a democracy, you would have had a situation in which there would have been far greater protests,"" he said. ""Any democratic government would have fallen by now."" Parsi said he was skeptical that large-scale protests are in the cards. Iranians ""are not going to go out there and risk their lives for a change if they don't know what the next thing is,"" he said. Iran saw a widespread popular uprising in 2009 after Ahmadinejad's contested re-election, triggering a brutal, deadly crackdown by government forces -- and Ahmadinejad held onto power.","Several people, including two Europeans, are reported arrested .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Rawalpindi's police chief stopped doctors at the hospital where Benazir Bhutto died from conducting an autopsy, according to a lawyer on the hospital's board. In a video released Sunday, Benazir Bhutto, far right, appears through the sunroof before shots ring out. It was a violation of Pakistani criminal law and prevented a medical conclusion about what killed the former prime minister, said Athar Minallah, who serves on the board that manages Rawalpindi General Hospital. However, the police chief involved, Aziz Saud, told CNN that he suggested an autopsy be done, but that Bhutto's husband objected. The revelation came on Monday after new videotape of Bhutto's assassination emerged, showing her slumping just after gunshots rang out. The tape provided the clearest view yet of the attack and appeared to show that Bhutto was shot. That would contradict the Pakistan government's account. Read Bhutto's full medical report . A previously released videotape showed a man at the right of her vehicle raising a gun, pointing it toward Bhutto, who was standing in her car with her upper body through the sunroof. He fired three shots, then there was an explosion. In the video that emerged on Sunday, Bhutto was standing, and her hair and scarf appeared to move, perhaps from the bullet. Bhutto fell into the car, then came the blast.  Watch new tape showing apparent gunman » . These images seem to support the theory that Bhutto died at the hands of a shooter before a bomb was detonated, killing another 23 people. Doctors at Rawalpindi General Hospital declared the 54-year-old dead hours after Thursday's attack, but the cause of her death has been widely debated. Pakistan's Interior Ministry announced on Friday that Bhutto died from a skull fracture suffered when she fell or ducked into the car as a result of the shots or the explosion and crashed her head onto a sunroof latch.  See the likely sequence of events » . Bhutto's family and political party maintain that the government is lying, and insist she died from gunshot wounds. Bhutto's husband, in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday, called for an international investigation into his wife's death, saying the new video proves the Pakistani government ""has been trying to muddy the water from the first day."" ""Everything is now very clear that she was shot,"" Asif Ali Zardari said. Zardari also called on the U.S. government to push for an international probe. ""I want them to help me find out who killed my wife, the mother of my children,"" he said of the Bush administration. Javed Iqbal Cheema, spokesman for Pakistan's Interior Ministry, said the government's conclusion on Bhutto's death was based on ""absolute facts, nothing but the facts"" and ""it was corroborated by the doctor's report."" But Minallah issued an open letter on Monday and released the doctors' clinical notes to distance them from the government statement, and he also talked to CNN. In the letter, Minallah said the doctors ""suggested to the officials to perform an autopsy,"" but that Saud ""did not agree."" He noted that under the law, police investigators have ""exclusive responsibility"" in deciding to have an autopsy. Minallah told CNN that he was speaking out because the doctors at the hospital were ""threatened."" ""They are government servants who cannot speak; I am not,"" he said. He did not elaborate on the threats against the doctors. He said the lack of an autopsy has created ""a perception that there is some kind of cover-up, though I might not believe in that theory."" ""There is a state within the state, and that state within the state does not want itself to be held accountable,"" Minallah said. Cheema said the government had no objection to Bhutto's body being exhumed for an autopsy if the family requested it. Her widower has said the family was against exhumation because it did not trust the government. Minallah said the family could not have prevented an autopsy at the hospital without getting an order from a judge. The three-page medical report, which was signed by seven doctors, described Bhutto's head wound, but it did not conclude what caused it. It noted that X-ray images were made after she was declared dead. The wound was described as an irregular oval of about 5 centimeters by 3 centimeters above her right ear. ""Sharp bones edges were felt in the wound,"" it read. ""No foreign body was felt in the wound."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- We are a nosy country. Though to be fair, it's not entirely our fault. Between the 24/7 news cycle, social media and reality TV, we have been spoon fed other people's private business for so long we now assume it's a given to know everything. And if there are people who choose not to disclose, they must be hiding something. Being told that something's ""none of your business"" is slowly being characterized as rude, and if such a statement is coming from the government, it seems incriminating. Times have changed. Yet, not everything is our business. And in the political arena, there are things that should be and need to be kept quiet. News: Issa, White House clash over Fast and Furious executive privilege . I know that's hard to digest in a society where pregnancies and marriages of D-list celebrities make the cover of People magazine, but there comes a point where the public's right to know needs to take a back seat to matters like national security and diplomacy. Heads should roll because of the Fast and Furious debacle. We don't need every detail of that operation to be made public in order for that to happen. If it were an isolated sting, maybe. But it is at least the third incarnation of a gun-running scheme stretching across two administrations, which means we could be pressing to open Pandora's Box. We do not want to open Pandora's Box, not about this and certainly not about a bunch of other potentially scandalous things the federal government has been involved with. Fast and Furious? Please. We still don't have access to all of the messy facts surrounding the Iran-Contra scandal that erupted during the Reagan administration. All we know is that weapons were sold to Iran in exchange for hostages and that the proceeds from those sales were used to illegally fund rebels in Nicaragua who were supposedly fighting Communism. Lt. Col. Oliver North took one for the team back then, and there's a good chance Attorney General Eric Holder will have to take one for the team in the Fast and Furious controversy. And by team, I'm not referring to Republicans or Democrats, but rather Americans. You see, freedom isn't entirely free. It also isn't squeaky clean. And sometimes the federal government deems it necessary to get its hands a little dirty in the hopes of achieving something we generally accept as good for the country. News: By the numbers: Fast and Furious . Such as the death of Osama bin Laden. We danced, we cried, but we did not make a big deal about a secret operation that was executed in Pakistan without the permission of the Pakistani government. The Obama administration did what it thought was in the best interest of America. Much in the same way, Project Wide Receiver and Project Road Runner -- the earlier versions of Fast and Furious under President Bush -- were executed with the hope that they will do more good than harm. Hardly anyone in the public knows the finer points of these programs. Were they legal? Hell no. Were they effective? Who knows? Were they done as a way to keep America safe? Yes. North was a fall guy. Not for President Reagan but for all of us. Just as Holder has become a villain to many who are pointing fingers at him. But to go much beyond the criticism of these men runs the risk of learning that this great nation of ours is heavily involved in doing some things that are not so great. Think about it: We have allowed weapons to cross the Mexican border and into the hands of criminals for years. Many of these weapons were involved in killing innocent Mexicans. There's nothing very admirable about that. But the truth is, it's very American. By allowing guns to infiltrate Mexico's drug cartel, we thought we could trace them up the ladder to the leaders. Take off the head and the body dies. As for the innocent people who lost their lives? Collateral damage. That's the uncomfortable backstory to this scandal. And there are likely other operations like it in our nation's history that we don't even have a clue about. And maybe it's better for us not to be so nosy, not to know everything because, to paraphrase the famous line from the movie ""A Few Good Men,"" many of us won't be able to handle the truth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: In things like national security, the public doesn't need to know the details .

"I found out that the May SAT test had been canceled across the whole of South Korea just a couple of hours after teachers were told. A chance conversation with a friend, who is a teacher at an international school here, revealed the scramble to organize alternative tests in other countries for young students hoping to get into elite U.S. universities. The decision was taken after a widespread cheating scandal was uncovered -- a number of scams were being employed to give some unscrupulous students and their parents advance warning about the questions to be included in the test. Cramming schools . According to education insiders in South Korea, cheating has been going on for years with cramming schools known as ""Hakwons"" mostly to blame. Hakwons provide extra lessons and coaching to ambitious children, who give up their evenings, weekends and holidays to study and revise for crucial exams. The Prosecutors Office in Seoul has confirmed it has so far raided several of Hakwons looking for evidence -- all 68 registered Hakwons being urgently inspected, according to media reports. The problem is there are hundreds of unregistered and unregulated cramming schools and tutors in the capital alone, who may be willing to cut corners to improve their results and earn themselves more customers. Selling papers . It is likely the scandal has tentacles extending across Asia. Brokers in Southeast Asian countries like Thailand are understood to have acquired SAT test papers in advance, selling them for large sums to middle men. At one of the raided schools in South Korea, a flustered teacher insisted off camera that his Hakwon had done nothing wrong. But at another cramming school, not implicated in the scandal, Vice Principal Byung Yeob Yoon claimed cheating is well known among super ambitious ""tiger"" parents and their ""cub"" kids, as they are known here, with tens of thousands of dollars changing hands for the test papers. ""The pressure is there to get the scores. They know there are some avenues where you can achieve higher results, through unsavory or unethical means, and this is a very combustible mixture,"" he said. ""We get a lot of tiger moms and tiger cubs, and that's why all this hyper competition is happening and that's why people are finding ways to you know skirt the system."" ""Just from the grapevine I have heard, tens of thousands of dollars (changes hands) for access to these tests. A lot of parents know where to go, whether it's a subject text or SAT 1."" Difficult decision . The College Board, which runs the SAT system, has issued a statement explaining why it canceled the May SAT test in South Korea. ""The College Board and ETS have made the difficult but necessary decision to cancel the May 2013 administration of the SAT and SAT Subject Tests at all test centers in the Republic of Korea. ""This action is being taken in response to information provided to ETS -- the College Board's vendor for global test administration and security -- by the Supreme Prosecutors' Office regarding tutoring companies in the Republic of Korea that are alleged to have illegally obtained SAT and SAT Subject Test materials for their own commercial benefit. ""The College Board and ETS explored every reasonable alternative to preserve the May 2013 administration before making the decision to cancel, and we recognize that this decision will be met with disappointment by the students in the Republic of Korea who planned to take the May 2013 SAT or SAT Subject Tests as part of the college admission process."" Plan 'B' But hardworking students who have not cheated are being penalized by the cancellation of the test. At South Korea's most expensive boarding school, North London Collegiate School (NLCS) on Jeju Island, pupils are scrambling to make alternative arrangements to sit the SAT in other countries like Japan or Hong Kong. Eighteen-year-old Sophie Lee will sit her SAT test in Hong Kong, much to the annoyance of her parents who will have to pay for the trip. She's hoping to study architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design in the U.S. and needs a good SAT score to get in. Nick Kim,17, wants to study engineering or economic management either in the U.S. or UK, but he's going to have to wait for another SAT test, possibly meaning he'll miss his chance of going to university next year. His friend Henry Kim needs a near perfect score of 2,300 out of a maximum 2,400 in his SATS to read physics and engineering in the U.S., so he's traveling to Japan to sit the exam, despite speaking no Japanese. He admits it's putting extra stress on him and may affect his score. ""We are getting penalized for the fact that other people cheated or tried to cheat,"" he tells me indignantly. Toby Waterson, a teacher at NLCS, is concerned about the damage to the reputation of Korea's education system. ""I just worry about the tarnish that Korean SAT centers have received in this whole process and I worry therefore about the university places that are going to be offered to our students."" Principal Peter Daly is also worried, but says he's not surprised that Korea's hyper competitive school system has produced a cheating scandal. ""The nature of the Koreans is that they have to be number one, they have to be top, the famous phrase in Korea is that 'A minus is the Korean,' F so it has to be number one. As a result these sort of things unfortunately have happened.""","South Korea SAT tests canceled after cheating scandal was uncovered .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi political leaders were unable to meet a self-imposed deadline this weekend to decide whether to request U.S. troops stay beyond a planned end-of-the-year withdrawal, lawmakers told CNN. The deadline imposed by President Jalal Talabani passed over the weekend with lawmakers divided over how or even whether to request an extension, raising questions about when Iraq may ask and whether it will be too late to turn around withdrawing troops. ""The country is almost paralyzed because of this decision whether Iraq will decide to keep some American troops after 2011 or not,"" said Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman, a close political ally of Talabani. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said months ago that the White House would need to know Iraq's decision by August. Talabani's office declined a CNN request for comment. Al-Maliki's office referred questions to Talabani. During the meeting at Talabani's Baghdad office, the representatives said they needed more time to consult party members, Othman said. He was briefed on the outcome of the meeting by his party, the Kurdish bloc. But an official in the office of Sunni Vice President Taha al-Hashami told CNN political leaders decided to postpone the meeting ""until further notice"" because there are still disagreements over a possible request to extend the stay of U.S. troops. The disagreement extends beyond the closed door meeting. Shiite lawmaker Hassan al-Sineid told Iraqiya state TV Sunday that U.S. troops should leave as planned. ""Let me tell you something, whether the Iraqi army is able or unable to protect Iraq's borders from external aggression, we shouldn't agree to keep some American troops after 2011,"" said al-Sineid, a member of al-Maliki's political party. Radical anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, whose Sadrist political party is closely aligned with al-Maliki, has vowed to escalate armed resistance if the U.S. military does not leave as scheduled, a move that could destabilize the country should the Mehdi Army repeat the bloody battles it waged against American and Iraqi forces during the height of violence. The Kurdish party, which represents Iraq's Kurdish territory, is pushing to keep U.S. troops, saying it wants some American troops to stay ""for the benefit of the two countries."" On the streets of Baghdad, Iraqis appeared as divided as their political representatives. ""I don't want to see American troops after 2011,"" said 33-year-old Qassim al-Shammari, a businessman. He challenged Iraqi lawmakers to broadcast a meeting and make public their decision. But Habeeb Forqan, a 25-year-old government employee, said he wanted U.S. troops to stay for another few years ""until the Iraqi army is ready to protect the country."" ""Every few weeks the Iraqi politicians give a new deadline to make a decision. It is a joke,"" he said. ""This issue affects our lives, it affects our future. They should decide quickly."" The failed weekend meeting comes nearly two weeks after newly appointed U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta urged Iraq's government to make a decision during a trip to Baghdad. A U.S.-Iraqi security pact signed in 2008 requires U.S. troops to leave the country by the end of the year. While the U.S. military says it is not aware of any deadline imposed by either the Iraq or U.S. governments, it has pushed the Iraqis for a decision. ""We have consistently said it becomes less feasible to support a new request once we begin reposturing our troops and as we continue transitioning bases and redeploying our equipment,"" Army Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, the top U.S. military spokesman in Iraq, told CNN in an e-mail interview Sunday. The decision about whether to grant any request to extend the stay of U.S. troops in Iraq beyond Jan. 1, 2012, will be made by President Barack Obama. The debate comes amid an increase in attacks against the roughly 46,000 American troops still in Iraq. Fourteen U.S. soldiers were killed in combat-related incidents in June, the largest loss of life among American troops since 2008, according to CNN figures. There also has been a spike in the number of attacks against civilians and Iraqi security forces, with more than 270 people killed in June, authorities said. The U.S. military has said the Shiite-militias -- Kataib Hezbollah, Asaib al Haq, and the Promise Day Brigade -- are using the bombings to try to take credit for driving American forces out of the country. Tawfeeq reported from Baghdad and Carter from Atlanta.","Iraqi political leaders are debating whether to ask U.S. troops to extend their stay .

"Until now ""sequestration"" has been a word that only means something to people living inside the Beltway or to political junkies who depend on their daily dose of Politico and The Hill. But if Congress and the president do not reach a deal by March 1, which appears likely, Americans will quickly learn what it means -- namely deep spending cuts. The spending cuts pose a significant political threat to Republicans, more so than to Democrats. Although many Republicans are standing firm, insisting that their party will be fine if the cuts go through, there are many reasons for the GOP, through a sober eye, to see the dangers that lay ahead. The cuts could push congressional politics in a liberal direction and establish the foundation for solid Democratic gains in 2014. Last week Bob Woodward argued that President Obama was responsible for the sequester idea, not the Republicans. But while people are squabbling over who owns the sequester, the GOP will take the hit regardless. The danger for Republicans is that the budget cuts will severely weaken public support for the austerity theme that the party has been promoting since 2010. The cuts will make ""deficit reduction"" something very real to average American citizens and business and something that is often quite painful rather than an abstract debate over numbers. Opinion: One cuts, Washington throws a tantrum . While Americans have historically been hostile to government, they tend to support specific government services when asked by pollsters. So Washington's overall spending might not be popular as a concept, but Social Security and Medicare are. The spending cuts will shift the debate toward the specifics. Americans will watch as government services are retrenched. The last time this happened, things didn't go well for the GOP. When the federal government shut down in 1995-1996 because of a budget standoff between Republicans and President Clinton, the GOP faced a huge backlash when Americans were unable to access basic government services, such as obtaining a passport or visiting the national zoo. Opinion: The spending cut fairy tale . President Obama has already been using the bully pulpit to make this case, appearing with first responders and warning of how the cuts will impact police, hospitals, teachers, airline workers and more. Standing in front of a group of police officers, Obama said, ""Federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go."" While these speeches are a form of political theater, they are based on very real possibilities. The budget cuts that result from sequestration would just be the first of the threats the GOP faces. If the government has to shut down as a result of a standoff when the government's general operating budget expires in late March or the debt ceiling is not raised this spring, Republicans will continue to lose the public's confidence in their ability to govern and the reduction in services will   highlight to Americans what the government actually does. If the economy sputters as a result of the spending cuts, as some economists predict, deficit reduction will look even worse. An already frustrated workforce will become even more angry, and likely take out their frustration on a Republican Party that has been insisting deficit reduction should be the nation's short-term goal, rather than stimulating the economy. Conservatives will  suffer as the focus  of congressional debate will quickly shift from the issue of spending cuts, where the emphasis has been since 2011, to the issue of spending more. Once the cuts go through, frustration and anger with the impact on government services will certainly produce increased pressure on legislators in both parties to offer a fix, namely to restore spending to key areas. Borger: Obama can't kick his legacy down the road . With legislators already thinking about the 2014 elections,  this will be tempting. If this shift occurs, Republicans, who have invested so much in making fiscal discipline their top issue, will be operating in a congressional environment where the    debates center around areas where the government needs to devote more government resources rather than less. The  automatic spending cuts are the ultimate symbol of a dysfunctional government. The reason the cuts were put into place was that President Obama and Congress were unable to reach an agreement on taxes and spending. Government leaders agreed to put a gun to their own head by threatening unpalatable cuts if they were unable to reach a deal. Now the trigger is about to be pulled. The problem for Republicans is that the polls show that the approval rating of the GOP is in the tank while President Obama is doing relatively well. According to Quinnipiac University, only 19% of Americans approve of how Republicans are handling their job. Obama is enjoying his highest favorability ratings since 2009, with 60% having a favorable rating of him in a Washington Post-ABC poll. The likelihood, as in 1995-1996, is that the public will blame the dysfunction on the GOP rather than Democrats and the party will suffer a further erosion of its standing as a result. According to a recent poll by the Pew Foundation and USA Today, Republicans would be blamed for the cuts by almost half of Americans, while only 31% would blame Obama. News: Top Senate Republican doubts damage from defense cuts . Sequestration will soon become a dirty word in the American political lexicon. While it is impossible to predict which way the political winds will blow, there is good reason for Republicans to see how they can suffer politically if some kind of deal is not reached. Republicans, who have now struggled through two presidential elections and are facing a demographic shift that does not work in their favor, might want to start thinking harder about their strategy on spending. Deficit reduction is no longer a winning issue for the GOP.","Julian Zelizer: Washington's budget fight will grab public's attention if no deal reached .

"Emboldened militants, backed by Sunni tribal leaders, pushed toward Baghdad on Friday as increasingly nervous U.S. officials mulled their limited options to help slow the militants' advance. In recent days, Iran has sent about 500 Revolutionary Guard troops to fight alongside Iraqi government security forces in Diyala province, a senior security official in Baghdad told CNN. However, that claim was rejected by Iran's Foreign Ministry. ""We have made our position clear. We are not involved in fighting in Iraq,"" ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham told CNN. A senior Iranian government official told CNN that Tehran is monitoring the situation in Iraq and could send advisers there, but would not send a fighting force. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reiterated his nation is prepared to help advice Iraq  if asked. Meanwhile, Sunni tribal leaders have lined up in support of radical Islamists from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, making their push toward Baghdad easier, a Saudi intelligence official told CNN's Nic Robertson. As Iraq further disintegrated, residents fled Mosul in droves. Militants captured the country's second-largest city this week after soldiers scattered, leaving their uniforms and weapons behind. Three explosions hit Shiite areas in the capital city Friday evening, killing one person and wounding 20 people, police told CNN. A car bomb also exploded in al-Tarmiya, a Sunni area about 37 miles (60 kilometers) north of Baghdad, killing two civilians and wounding seven others, police officials in Baghdad told CNN. The spreading violence prompted U.S. President Barack Obama to say the beleaguered government required assistance, but he warned Friday that it would take ""several days"" for the U.S. to react. ""This is not going to happen overnight,"" he told reporters. And, he said, the United States will need assurances from Iraq's government that it will work to find a political solution the crisis. A senior Obama administration official said Friday that the President has not yet made a decision on whether to act on any military options. But another senior administration official indicated that a decision could come as early as this weekend. Airstrikes are among the options on the table, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Thursday. But there will be no repeat of a large U.S. troop presence on Iraqi soil. ""We are not contemplating ground troops,"" Carney said. ""I want to be clear about that."" U.S. officials have also discussed bolstering ongoing efforts to send arms, equipment and intelligence information to help Iraq and its military. Kerry: Wake-up call . Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday that the ISIS militants are a threat not just to Iraq, but to the United States and the rest of the world -- and that is why Obama is urgently considering his next steps. ""Every country that understands the importance of stability in the Middle East needs to be concerned about what is happening,"" Kerry said, speaking at a summit in London. ""That is why I am confident the United States will move rapidly and confidently in order to join with its allies in dealing with this challenge."" Kerry said the latest events had been a ""wake-up call"" for Iraq's divided political leadership, which has been accused of failing to address growing sectarian divisions. The United States has a ""very direct relationship"" with Iraq, he said. ""I don't think anybody in the region or in this administration believes it is in the interests of the United States to turn our backs on that."" The militants from ISIS want to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state, in the region -- stretching from Iraq into northern Syria, where it has had significant success battling the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. Their lightning advance in Iraq has been aided by support from many Sunnis who feel that the Shia-dominated government has marginalized them. U.N: Summary executions, mass displacement . This week's violence has created a brewing humanitarian crisis, thanks to the displacement of some 500,000 civilians from Mosul, and sparked fears of widespread rights abuses against civilians. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay on Friday expressed alarm over the rapid deterioration of the situation in the country. ""The full extent of civilian casualties is not yet known, but reports suggest the number of people killed in recent days may run into the hundreds, and the number of wounded is said to be approaching 1,000,"" Pillay said in a statement. She said she was deeply disturbed by reports that ISIS fighters, including prisoners freed when the militants overran Mosul's prison Tuesday, ""have been actively seeking out -- and in some cases killing -- soldiers, police and others, including civilians, whom they perceive as being associated with the government."" Her agency has received reports of the summary executions of Iraqi army soldiers during the capture of Mosul, and of 17 civilians on a street in the city on June 11, she said. More than 500,000 people have fled the fighting in Mosul, the International Organization for Migration said Wednesday. Jittery families eager to leave sat in traffic jams stretching as far as the eye could see. The U.N. refugee agency said many left with little more than the clothes on their backs and were in urgent need of shelter, water, food and medical care. ISIS fighters amid civilian population . According to several U.S. officials, the U.S. military has not finalized a proposed set of ISIS targets in Iraq for Obama, amid significant military concerns that strikes may prove futile against ISIS fighters who are dispersed and mingled with a civilian population. Several more top-level meetings are scheduled in the next 48 hours, as Obama mulls his course of action. ""Our planning is looking at the full range of options,"" a senior U.S. official told CNN. Those options range from increasing U.S. surveillance flights over ISIS areas to potential airstrikes, the official acknowledged. Iraq has indicated a willingness for the U.S. military to conduct airstrikes against the militants. Washington has already provided $15 billion in training, weapons and equipment to the Iraqi government. The country has been plagued by instability, though not on the current scale, for years. The United States led the 2003 invasion that toppled longtime leader Saddam Hussein. Peshmerga gains . On Friday, fighting for control of towns in Iraq continued. Dozens of ISIS fighters clashed with Iraqi security forces for two hours in Um Garami village, about 100 kilometers north of Baghdad, police officials in Baquba said. They tried to take over the village but ended up withdrawing after Iraqi security forces aggressively pushed back, according to the officials. Meawhile, three villages in Diayal province were taken over by ISIS fighters, the police officials said. Nearly 100 fighters attacked the Sunni towns of al-Asriya, Hamreen and Askari, where they clashed with security forces, and won, said the officials. While the Iraqi army has done little to resist the advance of the ISIS militants, Kurdish fighters deployed by the semiautonomous Kurdish regional government, in coordination with Baghdad, are having more impact. The Kurdish fighters, known as the Peshmerga, are battling ISIS in Iraq's eastern Diyala province, said Mohammed Moullah Hassan, mayor of Khanaqin, a predominantly Kurdish area of Diyala. He told CNN that 95% of Jalawla'a was now under the control of the Peshmerga, while the town of Sadiya is encircled on one side by the Peshmerga and on the other by ISIS, with Iraqi security forces still in the town. On Thursday, authorities said Kurdish troops had beaten back militants to control the entire province of Kirkuk. Prime Minister Nuri al-Malaki has called on Iraqi citizens to join the fight against the militants. That call was echoed Friday by a representative of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the most powerful Shiite cleric in Iraq. During his Friday sermon in Najaf, Sheikh Abdul Mahdi Al-Karbalai urged Iraqis to volunteer and fight for security forces. ""The responsibility to confront and fight the terrorists is everyone's responsibility,"" he said. Meanwhile, Iraq's Justice Ministry urged the prisoners freed by ISIS from Badoosh prison near Mosul to surrender to security authorities, according to a statement issued to the media. It added that the detainees were convicted of civilian and criminal charges, not terror related offenses, and that a special pardon may be issued to absolve them from escape-related charges. Iraq claims victory in Tikrit . After days of stunning defeats, Iraq claimed a key victory Thursday. Tikrit, former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's hometown, was under full control of the military Thursday, state-run Iraqiya TV said. Just a day earlier, it appeared to be in the hands of militants. But that victory claim appeared in doubt again Friday, with militants still in the city and still the target of government actions. Airstrikes by the Iraqi military killed 70 ISIS militants and wounded 40 others in Tikrit on Friday, state TV reported. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said even though the military fled in Mosul this week, the government has since ""taken a number of steps to push back the terrorists."" The Iraqi military carried out airstrikes overnight targeting the al-Ghazlany military base, just south of Mosul, where a group of ISIS militants was believed to be based, the Iraqi Defense Ministry said Thursday. Footage surfaced on social media sites Thursday purportedly showing ISIS militants parading heavy artillery through Mosul, a predominantly Sunni city of 1.6 million. U.S. contractors evacuated . State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said American citizens working on contracts supporting U.S. military sales to Iraq are being temporarily relocated. Among those leaving for safety are U.S. contractors at a military base in Balad, about 55 miles (90 kilometers) north of Baghdad. The security concerns were exacerbated by the seizure of 48 people, including diplomats, in a Wednesday raid on the Turkish Consulate. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said  Thursday that the health of those captured is ""fine."" He said the government was working to secure their release. Militants also seized parts of Baiji, a small town on the main highway to Mosul where Iraq's largest oil refinery is located. Earlier this year, ISIS took control of the city of Falluja and parts of Ramadi. Across the border in Syria, it controls towns such as Raqqa.","Iranian ministry rejects claim that Iran has sent troops to battle ISIS militants .

"To Arizona's governor, a bill that would have allowed businesses to close their doors to gays and lesbians out of religious conviction was wrong for the state. So, she vetoed it. The buck may have stopped with Gov. Jan Brewer in Arizona on Wednesday, but the fight to pass such laws bannered as religious freedom issues is still on in quite a few other states. ""Right behind it are Missouri and Georgia,"" said Jay Michaelson, a fellow at Political Research Associates, a progressive political think tank. Brewer felt Senate Bill 1062 did not address specific dangers to religious freedom. ""It could divide Arizona in ways we cannot even imagine,"" said Brewer, who said she tuned out public pressure and made the decision she felt was right. Attention now turns to the following states: . Georgia . The Preservation of Religious Freedom Act has been introduced into Georgia's Legislature, and it is similar to the one vetoed in Arizona. The measure, which is moving through the state House of Representatives, allows a private company to ignore state law that ""directly or indirectly constrains, inhibits, curtails or denies"" a person's religious beliefs. An almost identical bill has been introduced in the state Senate. Much like the Arizona measure, neither Georgia's House nor Senate bills specifically spell out gays or lesbians as the target. The legislation is not on the calendar for Monday, or ""Crossover Day,"" the last day for legislation to pass the chamber in which it was introduced and transfer to the other chamber for consideration. But Georgia Equality Executive Director Jeff Graham said it could still appear on Monday. His group opposes the legislation. Graham doesn't rule out the bill moving forward, even if it doesn't make the calendar. ""This could still come up as an amendment to another bill."" Idaho . There are two bills being considered. HB 426 would protect people making decisions out of religious convictions -- including denying service to someone.  HB 427 gives people protection against legal claims made against them in cases involving religious convictions. If passed into law, the first bill probably would be vulnerable to constitutional legal challenges. Both bills could cause many disruptions to everyday life in the state, a state attorney general said in an article in the The Spokesman Review. HB 427 has been sent back to committee. Mississippi . A bill is being considered to legally protect people against being compelled to take any action against their religion. SB 2681 does not explicitly mention gays, lesbians or same-sex marriage. It has passed the Senate and was referred to House, where it is in a judiciary committee. Missouri . A bill that requires the government to show a compelling interest in any attempt to restrict a person's right to practice religion was introduced this week by Republican state Sen. Wayne Wallingford. SB 916 provides for additional civil protections to the state's existing ""Religious Freedom Restoration Act,"" according to the senator. But critics of the law say it's a way to discriminate against gays. Ohio . The House introduced HB 376 in December. It also does not single out same-sex relations for discrimination but gives legal protection to individuals acting or making decisions out of religious conviction. It's currently in judiciary committee. Critics say it's aimed at discrimination against same-sex couples, knoxnews.com reported. Oregon . The conservative Oregon Family Council is sponsoring a ballot measure -- the ""Protect Religious Freedoms Initiative"" -- that would allow private businesses to deny services that would support same-sex marriage. The group, which previously supported the effort to ban same-sex marriage in the state, is pushing to get the measure on the November ballot. South Dakota . Conservative senators introduced one bill that would allow businesses or people to deny ""certain wedding services or goods due to the free exercise of religion."" But its main sponsor withdrew it. But there's a second one protecting ""speech pertaining to views on sexual orientation."" It has been deferred to a late legislative day. There are also states where proposed bills have already hit a legislative wall: . Colorado . A bill that would have allowed people to defend against discrimination allegations on the basis of religious convictions was killed in committee, The Denver Post reported . Kansas . State representatives introduced a bill in January that would have explicitly permitted religious business people and government workers to refuse serving same-sex couples. It passed the House, with a vote of 72 to 49, but failed in the Republican-dominated Senate. Maine . A conservative senator introduced a religious freedom bill that would have protected people making decisions out of religious convictions that other legislators felt interfered with other people's civil rights. The state Senate and House both voted it down, the Bangor Daily News reported. Tennessee . Tennessee legislators introduced a bill in early February that proponents said would protect businesses if they refused services to gays and lesbians. Critics called it the ""Turn the Gays Away"" bill. The measure has been withdrawn from committee, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. Utah . Conservative state Sen. Stuart Reid introduced a bill similar to the Arizona bill that was vetoed, but it has since been shelved, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.","Arizona's governor felt it wasn't right; many lawmakers face her decision .

"I met an entrepreneur recently who was comparing doing business in Asia's two biggest countries. ""When I'm in India,"" he said, ""I spend the first 40 minutes of any meeting exchanging niceties. In the last five minutes, we get to business."" What about China? ""We do business for 40 minutes. Right at the end, we chit-chat for five."" It's only an anecdote, but the results seem to bear it out. China gets things done; India invents ways not to. China dazzles the world by hosting an impeccable Olympics; India struggles to complete basic infrastructure for the Commonwealth Games. Perhaps that's why it's fascinating to watch the rise of India's Narendra Modi, the man many believe will be India's next Prime Minister. Modi's sales pitch is simple: he gets things done. For Indians, it's a seductive notion: Can India be like China? There is no doubt that India has room to improve. Consider productivity: India's ranks 60th in the world on the World Economic Forum's ranking of countries by competitiveness (China is 29th). Or consider ease of doing business: the World Bank ranks India 134th in the world. If you want to start a business, the World Bank says India ranks 179th in the world -- in other words, go ahead and explore opportunities in 178 other countries before you settle on India. It's as good as putting a ""closed"" sign on the shop door. For businesses in India and beyond, Modi represents an end to red tape. India's financial markets are salivating at the prospect of his leadership -- stocks are up 20% since his candidacy was announced last September. If you speak to voters in his home state of Gujarat -- which has flourished with Chinese levels of growth under his leadership in the last decade -- Modi represents the joys of getting rich. Sounds familiar? That's because it evokes Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese premier who kick-started national reforms and an unprecedented period of growth. It's not just Deng. Modi has been compared to a number of world leaders. Some say he would be like Lee Kuan Yew,  Singapore's visionary leader. (Note that implicit in these comparisons is the understanding that Modi could tend toward being authoritarian). Others say the best person to compare Modi to is U.S. President Ronald Reagan -- because both were outsiders resented by traditional elites. Still others insist the best analogy is former British PM Margaret Thatcher, because of their shared appetite for privatization and small government. Modi could be any -- or none -- of those leaders. The truth is we just don't know; we don't have enough information about his track record, and how it could translate across India. But the larger point is that this is not just about Modi, it's about India. The Carnegie Endowment's Milan Vaishnav rightly points out that even the most reform-minded prime minister would face many hurdles. Among them, Vaishnav cites a J.P. Morgan study of 50 of the central government's stalled investment projects: 40 of them fell through because of state, and not central, red tape. Constitutionally, there's little a prime minister can do about that, no matter how reform-minded. Let me use another anecdote to explain the task ahead for the world's biggest democracy. Indians are infamous for being unpunctual. So, one wonders, is that genetic? Are Indians inherently prone to being late to meetings? The answer is no. Take an Indian who is unpunctual, and place him in New York -- he'll likely be on time for every meeting he schedules. Similarly, a New Yorker would likely become unpunctual in New Delhi. The reason is that punctuality is based on economic incentive -- if everyone is always on time, then it makes sense to make an effort to be on time. It follows then, punctuality is based on inertia. If everyone's doing it, it's in your best interest to follow suit. In a free democracy like India, progress is based on inertia, too. Everyone needs to push at the same time. Indians can dream to have cities like Singapore, Hong Kong or Beijing. But to do so they will need more than just one reform-minded leader. They will need change from the bottom up. For better or worse, such is the nature of India's secular, constitutional democracy. India can certainly learn from China. But to do that, it doesn't have to become China. In the next few weeks and months, that is the issue Indians will be debating.","Ravi Agrawal: India's business culture could profit from being more like China's .

"(CNN) -- Can Hewlett-Packard's motion-tracking webcams see black people? It's a question posed on a now-viral YouTube video and the company says it's looking into it. In the video, two co-workers take turns in front of the camera -- the webcam appears to follow Wanda Zamen as she sways in front of the screen and stays still as Desi Cryer moves about. HP acknowledged in a statement e-mailed to CNN that the cameras may have issues with contrast recognition in certain lighting situations. The webcams, built into HP's new computers, are supposed to keep people's faces and bodies in proportion and centered on the screen as they move. The video went viral over the weekend, garnering more than 400,000 YouTube page views and a slew of comments on Twitter. It was something neither Zamen nor Cryer expected to happen. Zamen said she and Cryer, her co-worker, were playing around with the computer at work and testing it when they stumbled upon the facial recognition feature. Cryer and Zamen said they were laughing when they realized the camera followed her and not him. ""We thought it was pretty funny, we thought it was hilarious,"" Zamen said. So they made a video, which they planned to just share with friends on Facebook and YouTube. There was no script, no rehearsal, just two friends filming what they thought was a hilarious software glitch. So again, the two took turns in front of the camera. ""As soon as my blackness enters the frame, it stopped,"" Cryer says in the video. ""Black Desi gets in there, no face recognition anymore, buddy,"" he says. YouTube.com: Watch the video . ""I think my blackness is interfering with the computer's ability to follow me,"" he continues. But now that the video has gotten so much attention, the two co-workers want everyone, including HP, to know they never intended the video to spark a discussion about whether the webcam was racist. Zamen said she liked the computer so much, she suggested Cryer get one for his wife. ""The intent was definitely not to go after HP, it just so happened the computer was an HP and we recognized the software glitch,"" Cryer said. ""We did it for laughs, but if the video does make HP put out a better product, then great,"" Zamen added. HP was quick to react, too. The company quickly posted on the it's blog, TheNextBench.com, on Sunday after the video went viral, responding to concerns. ""The technology we use is built on standard algorithms that measure the difference in intensity of contrast between the eyes and the upper cheek and nose,"" wrote Tony Welch, the lead social media strategist for HP's Personal Systems Group. ""We believe that the camera might have difficulty 'seeing' contrast in conditions where there is insufficient foreground lighting."" TheNextBench.com: Read the statement on HP's blog . Meanwhile, Welch pointed users facing similar problems to HP's help page, which provides guidance on how to change the lighting or other optimization settings on the camera. HP.com: See the HP help page . On Monday HP also told CNN in a corporate statement that the issue is most likely related to lighting, but they are looking into the situation further. ""HP has been informed of a potential issue with facial-tracking software. Consistent with other webcams, proper foreground lighting is required for the product to effectively track any person and their movements,"" the statement said. ""As with all our products, we continue to explore refinements which help to optimize their use."" Cryer and Zamen said they've heard similar feedback from commenters online offering ideas on fixing the lighting. The co-workers' video has also sparked others to try the product. After media coverage of the YouTube video, Consumer Reports did its own testing of the product to see if the YouTube video portrayal was accurate. ConsumerReports.org: Watch testing of the webcam feature . In standard lighting, the webcam didn't move with an African-American male as it did with a white male. But after lighting sources were added, the webcam was able to track the African-American male's face and movements. CNN's Mythili Rao and Rachel Sherman contributed to this report.","NEW: Video was meant to be humorous showing of software glitch, co-workers say .

"The heavily armed militants stormed the girls dormitory in the middle of the night, herding more than 200 students on to vehicles and burning down nearby buildings as they made their escape. That was a week ago Monday. Of the 230 students abducted from the Government Girls Secondary School in the Nigerian town of Chibok, about 190 are still missing, one official said. The number of girls taken from the school has been revised by officials several times, and on Monday, CNN spoke with Principal Asabe Kwambura, who said a new figure of at least 230 was determined after reviewing records and taking reports from parents. Isa Umar Gusau, a spokesman for the Borno provincial governor's office, put the number at 234 -- 129 science students and 105 art students. He said in a written statement that the confusion resulted because the art students didn't leave campus as expected on the day of the attack. The head of the dormitory initially didn't count them among the missing. No one knows where the missing girls are. And even more surprising, no one's particularly shocked. ""All the community are sympathizing with the parents,"" Kwambura told CNN earlier. But, she said, ""the people in the villages are not surprised."" Such is life in the lawless Borno province. Tucked away near the border with Cameroon, with phone services cut off and travel strongly discouraged, this poor corner of Nigeria is no stranger to such brazen, violent acts. For 11 months, the provinces of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa have been under a state of emergency due to relentless assaults blamed on Boko Haram. The Islamist militant group has bombed churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders. Boko Haram -- whose name means ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language -- says it wants to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Africa's most populous nation. The group has gone about its misguided mission with such depressing regularity that residents have become somewhat numb. Where's the president? Nigerians marvel that U.S. President Barack Obama traveled to Massachusetts after the Boston Marathon bombings  that killed three people last year. Boko Haram-related violence killed 1,500 in the first three months of this year alone. And yet, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has not visited the region recently. Part of it may have to do with geographic divisions. Jonathan is from the predominantly Christian south. That's not just geographically distant but also culturally different from the Muslim-dominated, violence-wracked north. To put things in perspective, none of Jonathan's major political rivals from the north attended his inauguration in 2011. And widespread violence broke out in the north when his presidential win was announced, with some residents claiming the election was rigged. It's the opposite of what happened with Jonathan's predecessor. The previous president, Umaru Yar'Adua, was from the north. During his tenure, violence ravaged the country's oil-rich, southern Niger Delta, with militant groups saying they wanted a fairer distribution of the region's oil wealth. Where's the military? The Nigerian military has been engaged in a brutal, ever-escalating fight with Boko Haram. Rights group accuse both sides of ruthlessness -- Boko Haram of indiscriminate attacks, and the military of extrajudicial killings. But when it comes to the abductions of girls -- and there have been many -- the military has had a difficult time. Last week, the defense ministry erroneously reported that all but eight of the girls from the latest kidnapping were free. It retracted a day later. Lawan Zanna, the father of one of the students, said the government turned from using ""blatant propaganda"" to making a ""blatant lie."" Part of the reason the military is loath to respond mightily may be because the girls who are kidnapped are raped, forced into servitude -- but rarely killed. In February, 29 college students in the northern Yobe province were killed after an attack authorities blamed on Boko Haram. All of them were males. The women were spared. In other instances, kidnapped girls were later rescued while working on farms. Many were pregnant or had babies -- the result of rape. The spate of kidnappings began in May 2013 when Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau announced in a video that this was part of its latest bloody campaign. The kidnappings, he said, were retaliation for Nigerian security forces nabbing the wives and children of group members. Those kidnapped, he said, would begin a new life as a ""servant."" But the latest incident has ratcheted up the pressure on the military. The military said ""ongoing, frantic efforts"" of security forces, vigilante groups and hunters are attempting to find and free the students. But a week later, the fate of 190 girls remain unknown.","Officials revise total number of girls kidnapped to at least 230 .

On Tuesday, he took that edict to the Senate floor in support of his plan to defund Obamacare, saying he would speak ""until I am no longer able to stand."" But his marathon appearance will not do anything to block Obamacare funding with a key procedural vote on the issue still scheduled for Wednesday. Instead, Cruz said his speech was to simply ""make D.C. listen."" Critics question his motives, though â€” is this about his principles or about presidential aspirations? CNN political analyst Gloria Borger said his Republican detractors think Cruz is putting his political career above all else. ""While many others have, no doubt, come to the Senate in the past as a springboard to the presidency, it's hard to recall someone who has created as much controversy within his own party,"" Borger said. Cruz has been in Washington for less than a year, but his short stint has been an effective lesson in partisan politics. Only history will tell, however, if his tactics will be worth repeating. The Texas Republican's counterparts in the House of Representatives have tried 42 times to roll back Obamacare, but their efforts have gone nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Cruz has upped the ante. His latest battle to disrupt Obamacare is tied to funding the government in the new fiscal year that starts on October 1. The House passed the measure last week. But Senate Democrats are not about to allow the health care bill to be unraveled, therefore putting at risk a government shutdown. Cruz's refusal to give up the fight has rankled many of his fellow Republicans, widening divisions in a splintered party. Democrats, meanwhile, are sitting back and watching the intraparty fight. Who is this guy? His effectiveness at political debate has landed Cruz in many successful places. He was elected to the Senate in 2012, after rebuking the Republican establishment and winning the Republican primary, paving the way to a general election victory. Previously, he was the youngest solicitor general of Texas and has argued multiple cases before the Supreme Court. He got his start at Princeton as head of the debate team and then honed his skill at Harvard Law School. What's his fight? Cruz did not take his Senate responsibilities lightly. As a freshman, he refused to stand on the sidelines until he's gained a measure of seniority, a common tradition in Washington. Instead, he was loud and opinionated. ""I find it amusing that those in Washington are puzzled when someone actually does what they said they would do,"" Cruz told CNN in February. ""At the end of the day, I was elected to represent 26 million Texans and to speak the truth. You know, I think a lot of Americans are tired of politicians in Washington in both parties who play games. Cruz was elected, promising to shrink government, especially the new health care law. That battle has been embraced by most Republicans in Congress, but his latest tactic has frustrated many. Political novice...? New York Rep. Peter King has been an outspoken critic of Cruz' latest crusade â€” at one point calling him a ""fraud."" ""Whether it's Custer, whether it's kamikaze, or whether it's Gallipoli or whatever, we are going to lose this,"" the New York Republican said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" last week. And Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee tweeted that he ""didn't go to Harvard or Princeton"" but that he ""can count"" that Democrats outnumber Republicans in the Senate. But Cruz said to let his critics talk. ""If you get outside of Washington, D.C., there is a frustration with Washington that is palpable. When you ask your constituents what are the problems you're facing, over and over again, the answer that comes back is Obamacare is killing jobs, is taking away my health insurance, is driving up my premiums, is causing small businesses to shrink, to go out of business. If we listen to the American people, that should be our priorities,"" he told CNN this week. Still, Republicans are frustrated by his insistence at fighting a divisive, losing battle. 'Don't break filibuster' ""We are giving Obama the escape out,"" Republican strategist Ana Navarro said on CNN's 'AC360.' ""Instead of now focusing on the problems with Obamacare, everybody's focused on the civil war in the Republican party."" Navarro also noted that the numerous polls, including CNN's latest poll, that while the public is concerned with Obamacare, they don't support shutting down the government over it. ""If you want to fix Obamacare or repeal it or fix it or change it, the best way to do it is to elect more Republicans. And the political cost of a government shutdown is really going to affect any -- any possibility of electing more Republicans,"" Navarro added. ...or political genius? While Cruz is ruffling the feathers of his colleagues in Washington, he is mobilizing the grassroots outside the Beltway. Conservative groups are praising Cruz. ""Senator Cruz came to Washington to advance conservative policies, not play by the same old rules that have relegated conservatives, and their ideas, to the back bench,"" Michael Needham, president of Heritage Action, recently said about Cruz. His group helps activate grass roots Republicans for conservative candidates and political causes. And Republican candidates running against Republican incumbents in the primaries are using Cruz' crusade in their races. Matt Bevin, who is running for Senate to replace top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell, said in a statement that he would support ""conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz in his fight to defund Obamacare."" Obamacare: Can it be stopped? Bevin bashed McConnell for coming out against Cruz' effort to shut down the government in order to stop Obamacare. Like so many other crucial fights, Mitch McConnell has caved to (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid on Obamacare and is refusing to fight to defund this disastrous legislation."" And long-time Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming came out in support of Cruz. He is facing Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, in a contentious primary. Will Cruz be scarred or be a star? Cruz could alienate his colleagues to a point where he becomes marginalized and completely ineffective in Washington. He has also hinted at a possible presidential run in 2016. If he has no support of the Republican Party, he risks being cut off from its resources and financing. On the other hand, Cruz' principled stand can help to grow a movement of disenchanted conservative voters. If a groundswell of conservative grassroots activists grows between now and 2016 -- and their financial support - Cruz could have carved out a path to the Republican nomination. ""I think what Senator Cruz understands is that he has more to gain from adhering to his principles, staying in touch with the grass roots here and around the country than he does being friends with other senators,"" Brendan Steinhauser, a leading Texas tea party activist who worked to get Cruz elected, said.

"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday began three days of potentially landmark oral arguments over the constitutionality of the sweeping health care law championed by President Barack Obama, with a majority of justices appearing to reject suggestions they wait another few years before deciding the issues. In one of the most politically charged cases in years, the health care reform case drew people who waited in line starting Friday for the chance to attend, and sparked competing news conferences by supporters and opponents of the 2010 law passed by Democrats over united Republican opposition. Hear oral arguments before the high court in the landmark case . The public sessions started Monday with 90 minutes of lively debate on a legally dense, but nonetheless important, question. It boils down to whether the health care law's key provision is a ""tax"" that could prevent the court from considering the broader constitutional questions. The key provision involved is the ""individual mandate"" requiring most Americans to purchase some form of health insurance or face a substantial tax penalty. An obscure federal law known as the Anti-Injunction Act, which dates back to 1867, bars claimants from asking for a refund on a tax until that tax has been paid. This ""gateway"" issue could stop the current legal fight in its tracks if the justices think the minimum coverage requirement amounts to a tax. Several of them seemed reluctant Monday to take that route. Read a transcript of the arguments . Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the lawsuit being considered was about the constitutionality of a provision requiring the purchase of insurance, rather than a tax penalty. ""This is a suit that is challenging the 'must-buy' provision, and the argument is made that, if, indeed, 'must-buy' is constitutional, then these complainants will not resist the penalty,"" she said. ""So what they're seeking is a determination that ... 'must-buy' is unconstitutional, and, if that's so, that's the end of the case. If it's not so, they are not resisting the penalty."" Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative, seemed to agree, dismissing suggestions that a ""parade of horribles"" would happen if the court decided the larger constitutional questions now. However, Justice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts suggested a tax was indeed involved. ""The idea that the mandate is something separate from whether you want to call it a penalty or tax just doesn't seem to make much sense. It's a command. A mandate is a command,"" Roberts said, later adding: ""It seems very artificial to separate the punishment from the crime. ... Why would you have a requirement that is completely toothless?"" In an unusual twist, the Obama administration is now siding with the law's opponents and strongly argued the mandate is not a tax. The high court actually designated a Washington private attorney, Robert Long, to argue in favor of the tax question. Four mostly liberal members of the court -- including Obama appointees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan -- were aggressive in saying there was no tax at play here. ""Congress has nowhere used the word 'tax'. What it says is 'penalty',"" noted Justice Stephen Breyer. ""Moreover, this is not in the Internal Revenue Code but for purposes of collection. And so why is this a tax? I know you point to certain sentences that talk about taxes within the Code. This is not a tax to a tax. This is a tax to a health care requirement."" Citing the Anti-Injunction Act might give the court, particularly conservative members, a way out of deciding the explosive issue in an election year. The majority might conclude the political branches can best resolve the conflicts, at least for now, or that the matter can be handled after the November elections. Some court watchers have called this the health care ""sleeper issue"" that could potentially delay a decision on the constitutionality of the individual mandate for at least four years. Monday's case was Department of Health & Human Services v. Florida (11-398). The larger, separate question of the individual mandate's constitutionality will be argued at the high court Tuesday. The justices as a group seemed anxious Monday to move beyond the narrow issue of jurisdiction and address the larger constitutional questions. By the end of Monday's arguments, justices already were posing hypotheticals on other aspects of the law, including the individual mandate and state requirements to expand the Medicaid program -- questions to be tackled in the next two days. Four big issues: Breaking down what the justices will tackle . Outside the court building Monday, supporters and opponents argued their own views. ""Everything this administration has done has moved us in the wrong direction, has created such a high level of uncertainty, reduced the confidence of the American people,"" said Republican Sen.  Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. ""The Supreme Court has to do the right thing and rule this thing unconstitutional."" Democratic Rep. Robert Andrews of New Jersey said the high court should let voters decide through elections, instead of imposing a decision by nine justices. ""This court has a long tradition of deferring to the judgment of the voters, and that's what I think they will and should do here,"" Andrews said, adding that the health care law will ""help a lot of people and help our country and that will be a great thing for our future."" A new CNN/ORC International poll Monday reflected the public divide over health care reform. The survey, conducted over the weekend, shows that the 2010 health care law is increasing in popularity, especially among independent voters, but half of Americans still oppose it. According to the poll, 43% of Americans approve of the law, up five points from last November, with 50% saying they disapprove, a drop of 6 points. Of those who oppose the measure, 37% said it was too liberal and 10% said it wasn't liberal enough. On the most controversial provision of the law -- a mandate requiring people to have health care coverage -- 51% of those questioned said they opposed it and 47% favored it, a gap within the survey's margin of error. According to the Supreme Court, 110 members of the public -- almost double the initial estimate -- were admitted to watch Monday's arguments, along with 117 credentialed members of the media. The justices know their eventual rulings could establish profound guidelines on the extent of congressional power and could shake up a presidential election year where health care has become a hot campaign topic. ""The social and political stakes just in this case in particular are quite significant, but even beyond that, there are broader constitutional principles,"" said Paul Clement, who will argue against the law before the justices. ""This is a legal question and it's got a lot of people excited politically."" ""The Affordable Care Act moves us very close to achieving health coverage for everyone,"" said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health advocacy group. ""It's my hope that the justices protect the law and allow the law to go into effect."" Health reform opponent: 'Congress made a bad situation worse' Health reform supporter: 'It really is going to help the public' Seats inside the court were scarce, both for interested parties and the public. Because of demand, the court's clerk told representatives from Congress, the Obama administration, the states and the dozens of private advocacy groups to decide among themselves who will attend. For example, 26 states are leading the legal challenge before the Supreme Court, but there will only be room for six attorneys general to attend the arguments. Legal sources said those negotiations over the choices turned testy when some officials were not picked. Blockbuster court rulings during election years . Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana; Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; and U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, said they secured precious seats. Attorney General Eric Holder led the administration contingent. And although it is little known, the justices themselves are allowed to give out up to nine tickets to anyone they want, so having an ""in"" with the bench might be the only way some interested parties will be admitted. The Supreme Court: How it actually works . Dueling rallies and protests outside the court added to the charged atmosphere of a major legal case being heard in an election year. All the Republican presidential candidates have said they would try to repeal the health care law if elected. One of them, Rick Santorum, did not attend the arguments, but he spoke on the courthouse steps afterward to challenge frontrunning rival Mitt Romney's support for health care reform in Massachusetts. ""There is only one candidate who has a chance of winning the Republican nomination who can make this the central issue that will be a winning issue for us to win the presidency back, and that is Rick Santorum,"" said the former Pennsylvania senator. ""And unfortunately the worst person to make that case is Mitt Romney and that's why, as I say, we are here today and he is not."" Two families, two views on health care reform . In the three days of arguments, six lawyers will make their case in what are expected to be free-wheeling question-and-answer sessions characteristic of oral arguments. The main attorneys will be Clement on one side, representing the 26-state coalition opposing the law, and Solicitor General Donald Verrilli on the other, defending the law. The public will be able to listen to the oral arguments on the court's website shortly after the sessions end. In line to secure a rare and precious thing in D.C. Frequently asked questions: A CNN guide to the arguments . The cases are Dept. of Health and Human Services v. Florida (11-398); National Federation of Independent Business v.

"The Obama administration announced revisions to the Obamacare contraception mandate so that nonprofit religious organizations can opt out of signing a release form to avoid covering birth control and workers for those nonprofits are able to obtain separate contraception coverage without a copay. ""This is part of ensuring that all women have access to contraception coverage,"" said a senior administration official. Earlier this month the Supreme Court issued a temporary order that allows Wheaton College to avoid covering birth control without filing a religious exemption form with its insurer. The new revisions to the Obamacare mandate reveal that the White House is anticipating the U.S. Supreme Court's finalization of the temporary injunction in the coming months. ""In light of the Supreme Court order regarding Wheaton College,"" said the official, ""the Departments intend to augment their regulations to provide an alternative way for objecting nonprofit religious organizations to provide notification, while ensuring that enrollees in plans of such organizations receive separate coverage of contraceptive services without cost sharing"" The July ruling on behalf of the evangelical Illinois school was seen as an important victory for those objecting to a compromise that aimed to allow coverage and allowed a workaround for those opposing it. The new White House revision aims to resurrect that compromise but cut out the so-called permission slip that had been a requirement for employers to skirt the Obamacare contraception mandate. The rules, which are still being worked out, will provide an ""alternative way for objecting nonprofit religious organizations to provide notification,"" according to the White House. In a brief filed Tuesday in the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, the Department of Justice said that ""The Wheaton College injunction does not reflect a final Supreme Court determination that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act requires the government to apply the accommodations in this manner,"" but that the rules outlined in the brief are meant to augment a Department of Health and Human Services accommodation process that will no longer require the use of a form -- for any institution -- if the temporary order for Wheaton College is enacted for all religious nonprofits. The senior White House official said that ""the administration believes the accommodation is legally sound."" The White House expects to issue the regulatory revisions within a month, upon which time the Supreme Court will be informed of the interim final rules. Appeals courts differ on Obamacare .

"On July 17, 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which withheld a percentage of highway funds from any state that didn't raise the minimum drinking age to 21. The week before, Reagan had declared ice cream a ""nutritious"" food. Perhaps that's a hint that politicians don't always know what's best for your health. Thirty years later, there is a group of people with Ph.Ds and MDs who take issue with the drinking age. They say, from a scientific standpoint, that the law may target the wrong teen behavior. Solving one public health crisis . The law came into being to solve a serious public health problem. Before the minimum drinking age law, 16- to 20-year-olds were the most common drunken drivers. When the drinking age was raised, the number of fatal crashes involving a young driver dropped significantly, from 61% in 1982 to 31% in 1995. It went down more for that age group than any older age group. But while the law did have a significant impact on drinking and driving, it did not stop kids from drinking.  In fact, it may have made drinking even more appealing to teens, whose brains naturally seek out risk more than adult brains do -- without considering what the consequences might be. A survey of students at 56 colleges across the country just a couple years after the legislation passed found that ""significantly more under-age students drank compared to those of legal age."" This study concluded that ""the increase in purchase age appears to have been not only ineffective but actually counter-productive, at least in the short run."" The definition of adulthood is not clear-cut when it comes to science. ""There's no magic that happens physically to someone when they are 21 as compared to age 18,"" said Dr. William Graf, a professor of pediatric neurology at Yale. The American Psychological Association (PDF) says that drawing a single line between adolescence and adulthood under the law is at odds with developmental science. They say adolescence usually begins at about age 10 and ends around 19, but really it depends; maturity is based on an individual's experiences. Developing brains . Current data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and Monitoring the Future, the two official surveys that monitor such topics, suggest that roughly 65% of college students (generally aged 18 to 22) drink alcohol in any given month. Most of the college students who choose to drink are binge drinking, according to a study out of Harvard. Seven out of 10 are consuming five or more drinks in a row. Binge drinking can have a damaging impact on a developing brain. Evidence suggests that heavy exposure to alcohol can cause irreversible brain damage and cognitive deficits, including memory problems. Scientists say the teenage years are one of the most important times for brain development, next to infancy. Neurons in the brain are growing and strengthening, connections are developing to allow the brain to transmit information faster and allow the brain to process more complex thoughts, and the brain goes through a kind of pruning process to eliminates synapses that are infrequently used. All this brain development has a huge impact on a person's development and mental well-being. It also means that young people have lapses in judgment during this time period as they try to figure out how to be adults. The limbic system, the part of your brain that is involved in processing social and emotional information, develops early in adolescents. But the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that involves judgment, impulse control and abstract thought and the ability to anticipate the consequences of your actions, isn't fully shaped until your late 20s. Mimicking behavior . Abigail A. Baird, associate professor of psychology at Vassar College, has spent her career trying to understand what happens with the typical adolescent brain. Baird argues that if anything, in terms of biology, the age limits on driving and drinking should be flipped. ""If I were queen for the day, I would move the drinking age to 18 and maybe not let them drive until they were 21, at least not with other people besides your parents in the car,"" Baird said. She likes the idea of graduated driver's license laws that slowly let young drivers have more responsibility as they get more practice in the car. This is based on the theory that they will learn how to avoid accidents as they gain experience. The statistics back her up. Before states introduced graduated licensing systems during the first six months of solo driving, newly licensed drivers were about eight times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than more experienced drivers. ""We all know adolescents are obsessed with learning from their peers. ... Adolescents learn based on experience. They are not good at learning abstractly; that's what changes a lot between 18 and 21.  When you get older, you can learn from reading stories about people and by really feeling for other people."" Baird believes that society could use the way young people learn, to help them learn how to drink responsibly at an earlier age. If drinking were less of a clandestine affair, perhaps a teen's peers could model more appropriate behavior for younger participants. She says it's important to learn how to behave around alcohol. ""Find me a business dinner that you will go to where you are not offered alcohol,"" Baird challenged. ""In our society, you do need to know what do around it and how much you can handle.""

"New Year, new coach and now a new racket, Roger Federer has been ringing the changes in his bid to top the tennis rankings again and made a winning start with his new equipment Tuesday night in Brisbane. Using a larger 98-inch racket head, the Swiss maestro paired with Nicolas Mahut of France to beat top seeds Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau in a men's doubles match at the ATP tournament in Brisbane. Federer practiced with the new frame in Dubai during his off-season and will now use it for a title at the opening grand slam in Australia in two weeks time. His big test with the new model will come in his opening singles match against Jarkko Nieminen of Finland on Wednesday, but he showed it off to good effect in a 7-5 7-5 doubles victory. 17-time grand slam champion Federer used a 90-inch racket head for those triumphs, but did dabble with a larger racket last summer after losing early at Wimbledon. Having made some minor changes, he has pledged to stick with the experiment in Australia. ""I have the feeling that this is the right time for a change in the racket. I've played through two and a half weeks with the new model and am confident,"" Federer told the Swiss-German daily Basler Zeitung. ""The racket is very good in the hand. But the truth will come out on the court. We'll see how it affects me in the tournaments in Australia."" Federer has also hired former six-time grand slam champion Stefan Edberg to his coaching team, having slipped to No.7 in the rankings last year and failing to make a grand slam final for the first time since 2002. He is favorite and top seed to land the singles title in Brisbane, playing in the tournament for the first time before he heads to Melbourne for the Australian Open. Britain's Andy Murray will likely be one of Federer's main rivals in 2014 and he is on the comeback trail after undergoing back surgery in the autumn. Wimbledon champion Murray returned to competitive singles action on the ATP Tour Tuesday with a 6-0 6-0 thrashing of local wild card entry Mousa Zayed in the first round of the Qatar Open. The third seed said after his easy win that he could be set to take his game to a new level having sorted out a niggling problem with his back. ""I guess with most surgeries you are trying to be better than you were before -- and so far the results have been good,"" he claimed. Murray is third seed in Qatar behind top-ranked Rafael Nadal, who avenged his 2012 Wimbledon loss to Lukas Rosol with a 6-2 7-6 win over the Czech in Doha. Second seed David Ferrer was extended by Alexandr Dolgopolov before winning in three sets, 6-3 5-7 6-3.","Roger  Federer trials new racket in doubles win in Brisbane .

"The United States could end up cooperating with Iran to stop militant gains in Iraq, Secretary of State John Kerry suggested Monday in an interview with Yahoo!News. But a Pentagon spokesman denied Monday that any military coordination with Iran is in the cards. In his interview with Yahoo!News, Kerry didn't say that cooperation with Iran is under active discussion inside the administration. ""Let's see what Iran might or might not be willing to do before we start making any pronouncements,"" he said. But he went on to say that the he ""wouldn't rule out anything that would be constructive to providing real stability."" ""I think we are open to any constructive process here that could minimize the violence, hold Iraq together -- the integrity of the country -- and eliminate the presence of outside terrorist forces that are ripping it apart,"" Kerry said. His comments are the first time such a high-ranking U.S. official has made such a public statement since militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria began an offensive that has seen vast swaths of northern Iraq fall out of government hands. Two senior U.S. officials said earlier that the Obama administration is exploring possible direct talks with Iran over the deteriorating situation in Iraq. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns is in Vienna for nuclear talks with Iran and could hold discussions on the side about Iraq with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, a senior administration official said in a background briefing with reporters Monday. In fact, the United States and Iran held ""very brief discussions"" about Iraq and the threat posed by ISIS on the sidelines of those negotiations, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" ""These engagements will not include military coordination or strategic determinations about Iraq's future over the heads of the Iraqi people,"" a senior State Department official said. But in a signal the administration hasn't yet reached a conclusion about what to do, two administration officials said the United States wasn't interested in teaming up with Iran because the two share few mutual interests. And Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters on Monday that the Defense Department isn't working on a plan to cooperate with Iran in Iraq. ""There are no plans to consult Iran on military actions inside Iraq,"" he said. ""There is no plan to coordinate military activities."" Iran is an ally of Iraq's Shiite-led government, and a senior security official in Baghdad told CNN on Friday that the country had sent about 500 Revolutionary Guard troops to help fight the ISIS militants. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani denied the report over the weekend, according to Iranian state television, but said he would be open to helping if asked. Despite their shared interest in stopping the advance of ISIS fighters in Iraq, the United States is wary of furthering Iran's already considerable influence there. The Shiite Iranian regime is al-Maliki's closest ally in the region. And the Obama administration is concerned that appearing to team up with Iran would both alienate Iraq's Sunni minority and worry Sunni allies of the United States in the region. But, as the crisis spreads, officials around the globe are scrambling for any way to slow the militant advance. ISIS, an al Qaeda splinter group, wants to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state, that would stretch from Iraq into northern Syria. The group has had substantial success in Syria battling President Bashar al-Assad's security forces. Here's the latest: . Iraq's military strikes back; new images emerge . After days of violent ISIS advances, the Iraqi air force destroyed a convoy of 15 vehicles carrying ISIS fighters headed to Baiji from Mosul, Iraqi state TV reported Monday. Separately, the air force killed more than 200 militants, state TV said. Air raids against ISIS reportedly took place in Saqlawiya, northwest of Falluja. 'Foreign legion' in Iraq and Syria may bring jihad to West . New images emerged Monday purporting to show a militant fighter interrogating and threatening to kill five captives. And a video appears to show a man in an Iraqi military uniform after he was shot in the face. The fighter boasted on Facebook that he was proud of killing the man and said the video should be passed around to show what could happen to other Shiites. The new images follow others apparently posted by ISIS to jihadi Internet forums appearing to show the executions of Iraqi security forces and a tweet, on what was claimed to be an ISIS account, saying its members had killed at least 1,700 Shiites. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the images or tweets purportedly posted by ISIS. More militant gains . The militant group racked up several victories across Iraq on Sunday. The northwestern city of Tal Afar fell to ISIS, according to Iraqi Gen. Mohammed al-Quraishi. Many Tal Afar residents, including ethnic minority Shiite Turkmen, fled the fighting north toward Iraq's Kurdish region. Also on Sunday, ISIS gained control of two villages in Diyala province, northeast of Baghdad. And Iraqi security forces and suspected ISIS gunmen clashed near al-Khalis, about 18 miles (29 kilometers) from Diyala's capital of Baquba, al-Khalis police officials told CNN. Three mortar rounds landed near a recruitment center opened recently for volunteers to help the Iraqi army fight ISIS. ISIS seized Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, last week and has threatened to march on Baghdad, Iraq's capital and largest city. ISIS uses social media to wage propaganda war . Intervention debate continues . President Obama met with the National Security Council late Monday to discuss Iraq. He has not yet made a decision regarding a military strike against ISIS militants, a senior administration official told CNN. The President will continue to consult with his team ""in the days to come,"" according to a White House statement. Obama's national security team met through the weekend, discussing the pros and cons of various options. On Monday, multiple U.S. officials told CNN that the Obama administration is considering several military options such as unarmed surveillance flights, increased intelligence-gathering and airstrikes. U.S. officials have said sending ground troops to Iraq isn't an option. According to a senior military official, another option under consideration by the Obama administration is increasing the modest number of U.S. military advisers and trainers stationed at the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad. Expanding training programs inside and outside of Iraq could be another option, a senior administration official said. The governor of Kirkuk, one of the provinces that has seen heavy fighting, told CNN's Arwa Damon that he would support U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. ""I don't think anyone is safe from these people,"" Gov. Najmaldin Karim said. But a U.S. official said last week that even airstrikes could prove futile given the lack of credible intelligence and lack of obvious targets presented by ISIS. U.S. Sen. John McCain, who has called for airstrikes against ISIS, says approximately a dozen forward air controllers would be needed on the ground to carry out such attacks. ""You need to have people identify the targets in order to really be effective. Remember we're not talking about bombing in towns and cities. There are long stretches of that desert that they have to travel across in their vehicles with their guns on them,"" he told reporters Monday on Capitol Hill. McCain also said he doesn't think Baghdad will fall to ISIS but the group could still wreak havoc in the capital. ""They can't take it. They haven't got enough troops and support.  Remember it's a Shiite city.  But what they can do is orchestrate bombings, assassinations, create turmoil. Shelling in different places. But I'm pretty confident that they can't take Baghdad,"" the senator said. U.S. sends Marines . The United States is sending about 275 troops to Iraq to support its embassy in Baghdad, the White House said in a notification to Congress. They will help the State Department in connection with efforts to temporarily relocate some embassy staffers to consulates in Basra and Erbil as well as to a support group in Jordan. The embassy remains open and a ""substantial majority"" of its presence in Iraq will remain in place, the White House said. Some embassy employees have been moved out of Baghdad, but most remain there, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Sunday. Over the weekend, teams totaling some 170 U.S. personnel began arriving in Baghdad, according to Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby. About 100 personnel were moved into the region to provide security, airfield management and logistics support, if needed, he said. ""The safety of personnel serving in diplomatic missions abroad is among our highest priorities. The presence of these additional forces will help enable the State Department to continue their critical diplomatic mission and work with Iraqis on challenges they are facing,"" Kirby said. An amphibious assault vehicle with 550 Marines aboard was expected to enter the Persian Gulf on Monday, the Defense Department said. The Marines and their V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft could help evacuate Americans from Iraq if necessary, a U.S. defense official said. Gas prices rise . Even though the ISIS advance hasn't had a major effect on the country's oil exports, gas prices around the world are rising. Oil experts say the 4% price spike since June 6 -- which has taken a barrel of crude to $107 for the first time since September 2013 -- is being driven by fear that exports could be hit later this year, just as world demand peaks.","President Obama meets with his National Security Council .

"Former President Jimmy Carter said embattled celebrity chef Paula Deen should be forgiven, arguing that while there's no condoning the racial slurs she uttered, the well-known personality has been candid and apologetic. ""She was maybe excessively honest in saying that she had in the past, 30 years ago, used this terrible word,"" Carter told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux in an interview Friday. ""I think she has been punished, perhaps overly severely, for her honesty in admitting it and for the use of the word in the distant past. She's apologized profusely."" Deen's troubles began about two weeks ago when a deposition in a discrimination lawsuit was released in which she admitted using the n-word in the past. Dean has insisted she does not tolerate prejudice, but her apologies have failed to suppress the controversy. The fallout has been swift and painful. Her Southern cooking business is reeling as major brands end or suspend their ties with her, prompting the celebrity chef to seek out professional crisis-management assistance. Opinion: Can we forgive Paula Deen? Sears Holdings is the latest brand to weigh in. The company said Friday it's phasing out all products tied to her brand. Carter said he remembers that the n-word was used ""quite frequently"" when racial segregation was the ""law of the land"" throughout the country, not just the South, where Deen is from and resides. Deen and Southern food: Critics say credit is past due . Carter mentioned Deen's programs in Savannah, Georgia, that benefit ""almost exclusively oppressed and poverty stricken black people."" He advised her to get people she's helping to speak up and ""show she's changed in her relationship with African-Americans."" ""My heart goes out to her but there's no condoning the use of a word that abuses other people,"" he said. ""I've known Paula Deen quite well for a long period of time; I advised her to let the dust settle and make apologies."" Carter was asked about a number of issues in the interview.

"The U.S. Supreme Court will rule Thursday on the constitutionality of the sweeping health care law championed by President Barack Obama, in a hotly awaited decision that is bound to divide the country. The stakes cannot be overstated:  what the justices decide will have an immediate and long-term impact on all Americans, both in how they get medicine and health care, and also in vast, yet unknown areas of ""commerce."" Five scenarios: Health care options before the justices . According to a poll released Tuesday, 37% of Americans say they would be pleased if the health care law is deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Twenty-eight percent would be pleased if the Affordable Care Act is ruled constitutional, the NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey showed, compared to 35% who said they would be disappointed if the court came back with that outcome. But nearly four in 10 Americans surveyed said they would have ""mixed feelings"" if the justices struck down the whole law. The survey of 1,000 adults was conducted June 20-24. The real people behind health care reform . Previous surveys have indicated that some who oppose the law do so because they think it doesn't go far enough. The polarizing law, dubbed ""Obamacare"" by many, is the signature legislation of Obama's time in office. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told supporters in Virginia on Tuesday: ""If Obamacare is not deemed constitutional, then the first three and a half years of this president's term will have been wasted on something that has not helped the American people."" Romney, whose opposition to the law has been a rallying cry on the stump, continued: ""If it is deemed to stand, then I'll tell you one thing. Then we'll have to have a president -- and I'm that one -- that's gonna get rid of Obamacare. We're gonna stop it on day one."" Speaking to supporters in Atlanta Tuesday, Obama defended his health care law as the way forward for the American people. Opinion: Aging boomers need health care law . ""They understand we don't need to re-fight this battle over health care,"" he said. ""It's the right thing to do that we've got 3 million young people who are on their parent's health insurance plans that didn't have it before. It's the right thing to do to give seniors discounts on their prescription drugs. It's the right thing to do to give 30 million Americans health insurance that didn't have it before."" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday that the administration is ""confident that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional, in keeping with decades of precedent under the Commerce Clause. We continue to implement the law accordingly, and we are ready for the Supreme Court's decision, whatever it may be."" In its ruling Thursday, the nation's highest court could rule the whole law constitutional or unconstitutional, or strike down certain portions of the law while letting other provisions stand. The Supreme Court heard three days of politically charged hearings in March on the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a landmark but controversial measure passed by congressional Democrats despite pitched Republican opposition. The challenge focused primarily on the law's requirement that most Americans buy health insurance or pay a fine. Supporters of the plan argued the ""individual mandate"" is necessary for the system to work, while critics argued it is an unconstitutional intrusion on individual freedom. All sides preparing for political fallout from health care decision . Four different federal appeals courts heard challenges to parts of the law before the Supreme Court ruling, and came up with three different results. Courts in Cincinnati and Washington voted to uphold the law, while the appeals court in Atlanta struck down the individual mandate. A fourth panel, in Richmond, Virginia, put its decision off until penalties for failing to buy health insurance take effect in 2014. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed Congress along strictly partisan lines in March 2010, after a lengthy and heated debate marked by intense opposition from the health insurance industry and conservative groups. When Obama signed the legislation later that month, he called it historic and said it marked a ""new season in America."" While it was not the comprehensive national health care system liberals initially sought, supporters said the law would reduce health care costs, expand coverage and protect consumers. Health care's big four issues: What the justices are tackling . The law establishes a staged series of reforms over several years, including banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, forbidding insurers from setting a dollar limit on health coverage payouts, and requiring them to cover preventative care at no additional cost to consumers. It also required individuals to have health insurance, either through their employers or a state-sponsored exchange, or face a fine beginning in 2014. Supporters argue the individual mandate is critical to the success of the legislation, because it expands the pool of people paying for insurance and ensures that healthy people do not opt out of buying insurance until they needed it. Critics say the provision gives the government too much power over what they say should be a personal economic decision. Twenty-six states, led by Florida, say individuals cannot be forced to buy insurance, a ""product"" they may neither want nor need. And they argue that if that provision is unconstitutional, the entire law must go. The Justice Department countered that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not ""choose"" whether to participate in the health care market. Congress ready for high court's health care decisions -- then it gets tricky . The partisan debate around such a sweeping piece of legislation has encompassed almost every traditional hot-button topic: abortion and contraception funding, state and individual rights, federal deficits, end-of-life care, and the overall economy. During arguments on March 27, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the law appeared to ""change the relationship between the government and the individual in a profound way."" Chief Justice John Roberts argued that ""all bets are off"" when it comes to federal government authority if Congress was found to have the authority to regulate health care in the name of commerce. Liberal justices, however, argued people who don't pay into the health system by purchasing insurance make care more expensive for everyone. Timeline of the health care law . ""It is not your free choice"" to stay out of the market for life, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said during arguments. ""I think the justices probably came into the argument with their minds made up. They had hundreds of briefs and months to study them,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a prominent Washington attorney, though he conceded that ""the oral arguments (in March) might have changed their minds around the margin."" The law, which helped spur the creation of the conservative tea party movement, is likely to be a centerpiece of the presidential election campaign. The legislation signed by Obama reached 2,700 pages, nine major sections and some 450 provisions. The first lawsuits challenging the health care overhaul began just hours after the president signed the measure.

"When we go to major sporting events, my kids love to play the ""Shuffle Hat"" game on the Jumbotron screen. A ball is placed under a hat, and the hats are shuffled around quickly to distract you. If you keep your eye on the hat with the ball, you can usually find it. The public increasingly faces a similar shell game with climate science information. Every four to six years, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assesses and reviews the most recent science, technology and societal impacts related to climate change. Created in 1988 by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization, the IPCC will begin the roll out of its fifth assessment report this week. In an era where some give more credence to climate predictions from rodents or almanacs, clarity is needed. U.N. climate change panel releases last science . For me, the hat with the ball from the IPCC report is that it continues to affirm that our planet is warming, and humans are a significant contributor to the warming. Andrew Dessler, professor and author of ""Introduction to Modern Climate Change,"" noted in a recent phone conversation the remarkable consistency in the main conclusions of every previous IPCC report. The analysis also provides measured thoughts on implications for the frequency and intensity of certain extreme weather events. Extreme weather and climate directly affect many aspects of society, including public health, agriculture and national security. Navy Adm. Samuel Locklear, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, has noted that climate change is the biggest new threat to Pacific security. Recently, an elderly man from my church said, ""Doc, what's going on? The weather is different."" For a public increasingly inquisitive about what they see around them, it is important to be aware of the distracting hats whizzing around and to keep your eye on the hat with the ball. Many recent discussions have focused on ""uncertainty."" Yes, topics of uncertainty exist in climate science as in any science, but this does not render the science unusable. Most readers would take an umbrella or expect rain if the weather forecast called for a 95% or greater chance of rain. How silly would it sound to say, ""Don't bother getting an umbrella because there is 5% uncertainty in that forecast""? Climate change may increase violence, study shows . Dessler characterized the fuss over climate uncertainty in the new report this way: ""The change that has everyone in a tizzy is a slight enlargement of one side of the error bar (range of error for climate sensitivity). If that's the biggest change, then things are not changing very much."" Another way of thinking about it is: How silly would it be for a father and mother to argue about whether their child is going to have a fever of 101.5 or 102? High profile legal cases like the O.J. Simpson or George Zimmerman trials have increased public understanding of ""reasonable doubt."" Environmental Health News' Peter Dykstra made a point that resonated with me. Science doesn't operate on a ""reasonable doubt"" basis. If so, I suppose we would take our chances and not grab an umbrella because that 95% chance of rain is not 100%. Similarly, would most parents not take action because the pediatrician's diagnosis has some uncertainty? It is important to understand and respect the scientific process. It operates differently than a court system, business decision or legislation. The peer-reviewed science literature provides a mechanism to publish, scrutinize and test climate science. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration ensures that our foods and medicines are safe. Peer review serves a similar role for science.  Good science inherently involves skepticism. However, regardless of the side of an issue, if the skepticism is always one-directional, is it skepticism or bias? Recently, the IPCC has been criticized for being too slow or too big. This is a fair discussion to have, but it shouldn't distract us from the findings in the latest report. Science requires time to sort out the truth from fiction, for theories to be tested or challenged. It is not well suited for tweets and blogs, which allow ""zombie theories"" -- ideas that have been debunked but continue to live on. Along these lines, some publications are removing or limiting online comments in order to protect scientific integrity. As I write this commentary, I am watching football highlights. I debate football vigorously with my friends, but we always walk away friends. Irrespective of viewpoint, calling people ""deniers"" or ""warmists"" is counterproductive and inflammatory. There are deep-rooted feelings that have created zealotry, and at times, all sides have crossed lines of civility. I am proud to say that I enjoy very solid collegial and personal relationships with people who I sometimes disagree with on climate science. Climate sticker shock: Arctic thaw could cost $60 trillion . On the eve of the IPCC's fifth assessment report, I still have faith in the scientific method, the common sense and keen eye of people, and human courtesy. These things will keep our hat with the ball.","The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change releases its fifth assessment report Friday .

"An Alabama judge this week gave a convicted rapist a sentence in which he could avoid jail time altogether, a move that shocked the victim and the defense. ""I'm still baffled,"" the victim, Courtney Andrews, told CNN. She came forward publicly to express her outrage over Wednesday's sentencing. ""I don't know how any of this is possible."" The defense for Austin Clem, 25, was also caught off guard at first. ""Frankly, I think the judge's sentence was surprising to most everyone in the courtroom,"" said Clem's attorney, Dan Totten. Clem was convicted of one count of forcible rape and two counts of second-degree rape, attacks that occurred when Andrews was a minor. Limestone County Judge James Woodroof handed down jail terms of 20 years for the forcible rape and 10 years each for the second-degree rape charges, to run concurrently, but he suspended those sentences. Instead, he opted for three community corrections sentences of two years plus three years of supervised probation, to be carried out concurrently. Clem must register as a sex offender, but if he follows all the guidelines, he will stay out of prison. Beyond expressing surprise at the judge's actions, both sides found little else about which to agree. ""Honestly, I didn't understand when I first heard the sentence,"" said Andrews, now 20. ""I was expecting him to spend a long time in prison."" She spoke of abuse that started when she was 13, saying she kept quiet for years because of threats. ""I was hurt for a long time,"" she said. ""I had to grow up at a very, very young age, and I know what it's like to have your life threatened and that no one will understand me."" Woodroof did not return CNN's calls Friday to explain his ruling. The county's district attorney, Brian Jones, told CNN he was ""reviewing available options to set aside this sentence and to achieve a sentence that gives justice to our victim."" Jones could not offer specifics on what options are available saying he could not ""comment publicly on the particulars of this case."" During the sentencing phase of the trial, prosecutors offered evidence that Clem had participated in a rehabilitation program for sex offenders when he was a teen. Clem's attorney confirmed his client's history. ""(Clem) did go through a program. He was sent to the Department of Youth Services for a sex abuse case that occurred when he was well under 15-years-old,"" said Totten. Regardless of Clem's past troubles, from Totten's point of view the sentence was too harsh. ""This is a case with two sides to the coin,"" Totten said. ""There are two sides. The evidence was not clear and convincing."" The lawyer says Clem is considering an appeal on the conviction. He has 30 days from the sentencing to do so. As the sentence stands, the requirements for community corrections are so stringent that they are in effect a form of house arrest, Totten said. ""It sets a bar so high, I don't know of a lot of people who could abide by these limitations,"" he said. According to Clem's attorney, the relationship should not have happened because Clem was married and Andrews was a minor, but it was consensual. Andrews was good friends with Clem's wife and kept going to his house even after the initial attacks, Totten said. ""It doesn't appear from her actions that she was saying 'no,' "" he said. Andrews won't hear any of that. At that young age, she could not legally consent to anything. She stayed in Clem's life, she said, because she was manipulated and threatened. At first, he told her it was OK, but that she couldn't tell anyone. Later, she said, it turned into threats on her life. ""What am I supposed to do?"" she asked. ""It takes everything I have to not just hate him."" Andrews said she is in shock. ""I have absolutely no idea how he got this sentence,"" she said.","Austin Clem was convicted of raping a minor .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi flatly denied Monday the existence of the protests threatening to end his 41-year rule, as reports of fighting between government forces and rebels raged another day. In a joint interview with ABC News' Christiane Amanpour and the BBC, Gadhafi also denied using force against his people, Amanpour reported. Excerpts of the interview were posted on the networks' websites. ""No demonstration at all in the streets,"" he said, speaking at a restaurant in Tripoli. Told by the BBC's Jeremy Bowen that he had seen demonstrators in the streets that morning, Gadhafi asked, ""Are they supporting us?"" ""They love me, all my people with me, they love me all. They will die to protect me, my people,"" he said. Government forces have repeatedly clashed with demonstrators over the past two weeks in Libya, fired on crowds and at times shot indiscriminately at people in the streets, numerous witnesses have told CNN. The death toll has topped 1,000, according to an estimate from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Soon after Gadhafi's interview, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said the Libyan strongman sounded ""delusional."" ""And when he can laugh in talking to American and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people, it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality,"" she said. Gadhafi's regime has lost control of parts of the country to rebel forces, and with each passing day more Libyan officials around the world have defected, joining calls for his ouster. The use of the term ""rebel"" to describe the anti-government forces is apt, said Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO and now a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Forces. ""In Egypt, you didn't have a force that was developed; you had protesters who were demonstrating against the government and the government relented,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""Here, you actually have a government that retains force at its disposal and you have demonstrators joined by elements of the military that have forces at their disposal. So it really has become an armed rebellion."" Even as Gadhafi sought to project confidence Monday, reports came in that a military jet bombed a military base in an area controlled by rebel forces. The base is near Ajdabiya, 90 miles south of Benghazi, a stronghold of government opponents. Some bases in the area have fallen into the hands of protesters as more members of the military have abandoned Gadhafi's regime and joined demonstrations. Several soldiers told CNN they switched their allegiance after refusing to use weapons against peaceful demonstrators. CNN saw the military jet fly overhead and heard the sounds of explosions. Witnesses reported a bombing at the base. But Libyan state television later denied any such bombing had occurred. The Temporary General Committee for Defense said reports that the Libyan air force conducted strikes on the ammunition depots in the cities of Ajdabiya and Rajima were false, state TV reported. While CNN has staff in some cities, the network can not independently confirm reports for many areas in Libya. CNN has gathered information through telephone interviews with witnesses. Pro-Gadhafi forces also tried to attack a radio station in Misrata, a city controlled by protesters, a witness said. A military chopper with soldiers on board has tried to land a couple of times over the past three days, but the opposition fired at the soldiers and kept them away, the witness said. The international community, meanwhile, launched new efforts Monday to pressure Gadhafi to halt the violence. ""He has lost his legitimacy when he declared war on his people,"" Secretary-General Ban said about embattled Libyan leader, urging him to heed the call of his people. Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said the United States is ""repositioning"" naval and air forces in the region to be prepared for any option that it may need to exercise. He would not comment on whether any ground forces are being put on alert or having leaves cancelled because of Libya. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, of the U.N. Human Rights Council that the United States is exploring ""all possible options,"" and that ""nothing is off the table so long as the Libyan government continues to threaten and kill Libyan citizens."" ""Colonel Gadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for these acts, which violate international legal obligations and common decency. Through their actions, they have lost the legitimacy to govern. And the people of Libya have made themselves clear: It is time for Gadhafi to go, now, without further violence or delay,"" she said. Asked at a news conference whether the U.S. planned an imminent military response, Clinton said, ""No."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that ""exile is certainly one option"" for Gadhafi. Carney also said the U.S. government is considering the possibility of imposing a no-fly zone over Libya. Also Monday, the United States became the latest country to announce it had frozen Gadhafi-related assets. The U.S. government froze at least $30 billion in Libyan government assets under U.S jurisdiction after enacting sanctions on Friday, a Treasury official said. It marked the largest amount ever blocked under a sanctions program, according to Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David Cohen. In Tripoli, protesters stayed off the streets, telling CNN they feared violence. Government officials spread word that thousands of people could die if the popular uprising continues. On the 14th day of protests, there appeared to be a stalemate. Some in Tripoli told CNN they feared their protest movement was losing momentum. But around the world, support for the protests was growing. Yet another prominent Libyan official, the country's ambassador to South Africa, added his voice to the calls for Gadhafi to end his nearly 42-year grip on power. Gadhafi ""should take the ultimate decision to step down in the interest of Libya,"" Abdullah Alzubedi told reporters in Pretoria. The European Union's high representative for foreign affairs, Catherine Ashton, said the U.N. Human Rights Council ""has a grave responsibility to ensure that our often-stated intentions are translated into real actions and real progress."" Speaking at the meeting in Geneva, Ashton said, ""What matters in the end is not the number of resolutions passed but results in the real world."" In an interview with CNN, Ashton said stopping the violence means trying ""to persuade the people concerned that they will be held to account, that there will be the International Criminal Court, that we will stop their assets being moved, that we will hold them to account for their actions. That's what we do as an international community. That's what we have to make clear. And there's no doubt in my mind that actually they do listen to what's being said."" The U.N. Security Council over the weekend voted for tough restrictions and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime. The Security Council measures -- which include an arms embargo, an asset freeze and travel bans for Gadhafi and members of his family and associates -- also referred the situation unfolding in Libya to the International Criminal Court. On Sunday, Gadhafi criticized the Security Council resolution, telling private Serbian station Pink TV by phone that council members ""took a decision based on media reports that are based abroad."" He added, ""If the Security Council wants to know about something, they should have sent a fact-finding committee."" The protests, which began February 15, have been fueled largely by people demanding freedom and decrying high unemployment. As the 68-year-old Gadhafi has appeared increasingly cornered, some Libyan officials have begun to discuss openly what a post-Gadhafi Libyan government would look like. Over the weekend, Libya's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Ibrahim Dabbashi, indicated he and fellow diplomats support ""in principle"" a caretaker administration under the direction of former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil. Jalil quit February 21 to protest the ""bloody situation"" and ""use of excessive force"" against unarmed protesters, according to Libyan newspaper Quryna. Dabbashi told CNN Monday that Gadhafi has asked for a change in Libya's U.N. representation, though the diplomat vowed to stay on to represent the people. About 100,000 people have fled Libya to Tunisia or Egypt in roughly the past week, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees said Sunday, citing reports from the Tunisian and Egyptian governments. The evacuees include Tunisians, Egyptians, Libyans and many from Asian countries. Tunisia and Egypt are the two countries that have seen their leaders overthrown in the wave of protests that has swept through the Arab world over the past several weeks. Tunisians on the border with Libya waved pre-Gadhafi-era Libyan flags in support of the opposition. The Tunisian army, charities and ordinary Tunisians were trying to help Libyans on the border. Refugees said Tunisians were offering them food, water and the use of phones. CNN's Ivan Watson, Nkepile Mabuse, Eve Bower, Ben Wedeman, Salma Abdelaziz, Talia Kayali, Richard Roth, Tom Watkins, Jack Maddox and Whitney Hurst contributed to this report .","NEW: U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations says Gadhafi is ""slaughtering his own people""

"This week, the world's largest gathering of AIDS doctors and experts is converging on Washington for the 19th International AIDS Conference. It marks the first time in 22 years that the biannual event will be held on U.S. soil, possible only because a 25-year-old travel ban preventing HIV-positive people from entering the country was lifted by President Barack Obama in 2009 and went into effect a year later. The significance of that move is not lost on researchers all over the country. More than 25,000 doctors, scientists, AIDS activists, politicians, philanthropists, drug company representatives, people living with HIV and heads of state from around the world are attending the weeklong conference. There's a lot going on: research on how to prevent HIV infection, treatment as prevention and, for the first time in a long time, talk about a ""cure."" In fact, one of the main themes is the launch of ""Towards an HIV Cure"": a global scientific strategy by an international working group of 300 researchers who are developing a road map of sorts, outlining priorities for finding a cure for the disease that has claimed approximately 30 million lives worldwide. Timeline: 30 years of AIDS -- Moments to remember . Their goal: figuring out why the virus lives indefinitely in certain cells, which tissues it lives in, how to get the immune system to kill it and what kind of drugs can get rid of it. ""We are trying to both inspire people about the possibility that this might happen someday but trying to be realistic, and the realistic part is that we have to do some fundamental basic science first,"" said Dr. Steven Deeks of the AIDS Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Most reasonable people would say it's at best 50-50 that we're gonna get a cure, so we don't want to over-hype this.  We're excited, we think it's possible, we think it's worth pursuing, but don't expect anything in the near future."" Gay, bisexual men at high risk for HIV . One man in particular, Timothy Ray Brown, has pushed the limits of possibility. He's known as the Berlin patient, the only person said to have been ""cured"" of HIV/AIDS. ""I've been tested everywhere possible,"" said Brown, who now lives in San Francisco. ""My blood's been tested by many, many agencies. I've had two colonoscopies to test to see if they could find HIV in my colon, and they haven't been able to find any."" In 2007, Brown, an HIV-positive American living in Berlin, was battling leukemia and needed a bone marrow transplant. His doctor searched for a donor with a rare mutation that makes it resistant to HIV. The transplant not only cured his cancer, it appears to have cured his HIV, because the virus is no longer detectable. But Brown's case is rare. The procedure is extremely dangerous because a patient's immune system has to be wiped out in order to accept the bone marrow transplant. Using a bone marrow transplants to treat HIV is not a feasible treatment for most patients; only 1% of Caucasians -- mostly Northern Europeans -- and no African-Americans or Asians have this particular mutation, researchers say. Quilt displays an American tragedy . Last month, five years after Brows was ""cured,"" reports surfaced that traces of the virus had been found in his blood. Deeks says that doesn't matter. ""Clinically, he has been cured. He stopped his drugs five years ago, his HIV tests are turning negative, we cannot find with standard measurements or even really super-sensitive measurements any virus anywhere, so from a clinical perspective, he is cured,"" Deeks said.  ""There's an academic debate as to whether every single virus is gone, but from Timothy's perspective, he shouldn't care."" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is one of the foremost experts on HIV and AIDS and believes that Brown's case is a ""proof of concept"" that the battle against the disease can advance beyond daily drug cocktails. Deeks leads the global collaboration with Dr. Francoise Barre-Sinoussi of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for the discovery of HIV, along with her colleague Luc Montagnier. She says that by working together, they can get the job done faster. ""What we are sure is that we think it's reasonable today to say it's feasible to have a cure. A functional cure. I believe that if we work like in the early years of HIV, all together, we can move forward very fast as well for an HIV cure."" But what will a cure look like? There are two schools of thought. With a ""functional"" cure, the virus is controlled, and transmission would not occur. A ""sterilizing"" cure would eliminate the virus from the body entirely. On Wednesday, Dr. David Margolis, an AIDS researcher at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, is presenting results on a small study of eight patients treated with Vorinostat. It is used to treat lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes and bloodstream. ""We just have to start doing these studies and trying to make progress, and I think the big change in the last few years is that you can talk about it now, and we can start to work on it seriously rather than doing the scientific work surreptitiously but not using the 'cure' word because everybody thought that was irresponsible or ridiculous."" Margolis says everything is on the table to try. ""The assumption is, it's going to be complicated and difficult and involve multiple approaches, not 'take a pill and we're done.' "" French researchers are studying 12 HIV-positive people called the Visconti patients. According to Barre-Sinoussi, they were treated immediately after being exposed to HIV and have been able to control their virus naturally. Promising results from that study will also be presented. ""These patients have been treated very early on by the classical antiretroviral treatment during the acute phase of infections. They stopped their treatment, and now they are naturally able to control their infections with treatment anymore. They remain HIV-positive but they don't transmit to others, so it's also prevention."" Researchers also hope to learn some important lessons from a group of infected men and women called elite controllers. ""They do not irradiate their virus,"" Barre-Sinoussi said. ""But they are capable to naturally control their infection because they never receive any antiretroviral treatment. They have an undetectable viral load."" While small trials like these aim to find a cure, efforts to prevent infection have also made great strides. Last year, multiple studies showed that transmission of the virus can be reduced significantly -- up to 96% -- by giving antiretroviral drugs to the uninfected partners of people with the disease. It's called PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis. FDA approves Truvada for prevention of HIV/AIDS . For Barre-Sinoussi, all the pieces of the puzzle are important to future success, and she is hopeful of a cure in her lifetime. Brown, who believes that he is cured, is banking on it. ""It means that this is a case in point that the disease can be cured. I don't wish what I went through on my worst enemy, but I'm hoping that it can be done in a more simple way, that can be translated to a cure for the entire world, all people that have HIV.""","The 19th International AIDS Conference is in Washington this week .

"One month after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, nearly three out of four Americans say the police should arrest the neighborhood watch volunteer who pulled the trigger, according to a new national survey. And the CNN/ORC International poll released Monday also indicates that three-quarters of the public says that neighborhood watch members should not be allowed to carry weapons. Seventy-three percent of people questioned in the survey say that George Zimmerman should be arrested, with 11% disagreeing and 16% unsure. Zimmerman admits to shooting and killing Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager, in Sanford, Florida, on February 26. Calls for justice rage on in Trayvon Martin's killing . Zimmerman, 28, claims Martin attacked him and he shot in self-defense, according to police. Martin's family and supporters say the unarmed 17-year-old was no more threatening than the bag of Skittles candy and the iced tea he was carrying. The shooting has grabbed national headlines and has renewed the national conversation about race relations, gun laws, and even how young men dress. It sparked a national furor that reached all the way to the White House, prompting President Barack Obama last week to call for national soul-searching to discover how something so tragic could happen. Protests continue Monday, with rallies planned for major cities across the country. Are you attending a rally? Tell us why you march for Trayvon . Zimmerman is a white Hispanic, and family and supporters of Martin believe race was an issue in the shooting. Zimmerman's family say he has been mistakenly portrayed as racist. A special prosecutor is investigating the case, with a grand jury scheduled to begin deliberations on April 10. The prosecutor, Angela Corey, said last week that she does not know if a grand jury will be necessary. ""Nearly two-thirds of whites and 86% of non-whites say Zimmerman should be arrested,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland, ""as well as majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independent voters."" Sanford authorities say they could not arrest Zimmerman under Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which allows people to use deadly force to defend themselves anywhere they feel a reasonable fear of death or serious injury. The evidence police had at the time didn't allow for an arrest, police have said. Zimmerman's attorney said Sunday that after reviewing Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, he believes it applies to the situation and that his client is innocent. Shooting renews debate over 'stand your ground' laws . Zimmerman said he was driving in his gated community when he saw Martin walking and called 911 to report a suspicious person. He told the dispatcher he was following the teen, but the dispatcher told him that wasn't necessary. Moments later, several neighbors called 911 to report a commotion outside, and police arrived to find Martin dead of a gunshot wound. The survey indicates that 55% of all Americans approve of so-called ""stand your ground"" laws, although there is a big gender gap on that question, with men approving of the laws 64%-34% and women opposing the measures 52%-46%. According to the poll, only one in five believe that neighborhood watch members should carry guns, with 76% saying they should not be allowed to be armed. The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International on Saturday and Sunday, with 1,014 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.","73% in CNN/ORC International poll say George Zimmerman should be arrested .

"Forty years ago, English was the top major at Yale. Today it's not even in the top five. History majors there have fallen by more than half in the last decade. At Harvard, humanities majors fell from 14% of students in 1966 to 7% in 2010. And it's not just the Ivies. Every month there seems to be a new report on how liberal arts and the humanities are disappearing from American colleges and universities. Academics everywhere are asking each other anxiously what they can do to reverse the decline. But they're asking the wrong people the wrong question. Instead of talking mainly to other elites, champions of a well-rounded liberal arts education should be speaking directly and more creatively to the public. The question they should be asking is this: Do you realize you are missing out on a golden pathway to influence and purpose? And this: Do you realize you're going to need us soon to rescue the United States? This is brave talk, I know, considering that the share of students majoring in the humanities has been shrinking dramatically. The reasons are well known and seemingly unstoppable: As higher education has gotten far more expensive, parents and legislators demand better ""return on investment."" The greater the focus on ROI, the more attention is paid to ""strategic"" fields with obvious employment prospects, like business and computer science. And the more that happens, the less interest there is in fields like English, philosophy and, as President Obama himself mockingly noted, art history. I have nothing against the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math. Nor do I think a business or marketing degree is inherently useless. But the rush to ""practical"" education, which has accelerated since the Great Recession, arises not so much from optimism about what science and technology can do for our country but from anxiety about falling behind in a time of severe inequality. When a society like America becomes ever more winner-takes-all, panic starts to set in. People obsess over declines in relative status. They forget why we educate children. They forget what made (and can still make) our country exceptional. A liberal arts education has its roots, etymologically and otherwise, in the requirements of liberty: what it takes to be a self-governing citizen rather than a slave. To be a citizen of a country like the United States you should be literate in the humanities as well as the sciences, in the arts as well as accounting. Illiteracy is risky. Willful illiteracy is civic malpractice. To disparage liberal arts, as politicians often do, is to disparage citizenship itself. And though it may seem populist to champion so-called practical fields, there's nothing more elitist than saying that most people can't benefit from a liberal arts education. This is why it's frustrating how poorly some humanities champions make their case, especially when they do so on terms set by the very marketplace that devalues them. It is true -- perhaps surprisingly -- that liberal arts majors, during their peak earning years, make more money than people who studied pre-professional fields. But I believe those who study the humanities also end up being great citizens, leaders and creators. A humanities education offers very few skills except for those that can't be automated. A humanities education offers very little job security except for the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. You should study history only if you're interested in how people exercise power over one another. You should study literature only if you're interested in understanding the motivations of your friends, family, colleagues and competitors. You should study art and art history only if you're interested in seeing patterns others don't or can't. You should study theater only if you're interested in knowing how to read and send cues in social situations. You should study philosophy only if you're interested in creating the explanatory frameworks within which everyone else lives. You should study music only if you're interested in having a voice. But don't take my word for it. Ask Barack Obama (political science), Conan O'Brien (English and history), Michael Lewis (art history), Oprah Winfrey (speech and drama), Stephen Colbert (philosophy and theater), Ted Turner (classics), Clarence Thomas (English literature) or Natalie Portman (psychology). As Americans worry ever more about keeping up, whether because of inequality at home or competition from China, we should heed the example of Steve Jobs. Jobs didn't have to be one of the world's best software coders. All he had to do was develop the vision that would attract some of the world's most talented coders. China can manufacture all the planet's iPhones. Americans still imagine and design them. That's an advantage we have to cultivate in our colleges. As Jobs once said, ""technology alone is not enough -- it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing.""","Some reports say that a liberal arts education in the U.S. is losing luster .

"(CNN)  -- It's as predictable as the sun rising and setting. Even though police made more than 850,000 marijuana arrests last year, a recent government report shows youth marijuana use increased by about 9 percent. Supporters of the failed war on drugs will no doubt argue this increase means policymakers should spend more taxpayer money next year arresting and incarcerating a greater number of Americans.  In other words, their solution to failure is to do more of the same. Fortunately, the ""reform nothing"" club is getting mighty lonely these days -- 76 percent of Americans recognize the drug war has failed; millions are demanding change. In the almost 40 years since President Nixon declared a war on drugs, tens of millions of Americans have been arrested and hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent. Yet drugs are just as available now as they were then. It is hard to find even an elected official who hasn't used marijuana or other illegal drugs. President Obama used drugs. Former President George W. Bush made taped comments that many interpreted as indicating he did too. Then there's Bill Clinton, who famously said he smoked pot but didn't inhale. Al Gore, Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin admit they used drugs. Drug use is so widespread the FBI changed its policy of not hiring people with a history of illegal drug use because the policy disqualified so many people that it could not fill its law enforcement positions. The war on drugs hasn't just failed; it's created problems of it own. Laws restricting the availability of sterile syringes have increased the spread of AIDS and hepatitis C. Aggressive campaigns to arrest and incarcerate drug users have increased drug-related deaths by making drug users too afraid to call 911 when a friend is overdosing. The government's misleading and over-the-top anti-drug messages have made young people mistrust other anti-drug messages from parents and adults. Mass incarceration of drug offenders has drained state and federal resources, distracted police from dealing with violent crime, and produced a generation of children with one or both parents behind bars instead of at home. The racial disparities are appalling. As Michelle Alexander so eloquently shows in her new book, ""The New Jim Crow,"" a drug conviction automatically makes a person a second-class citizen who can be legally discriminated against in housing and employment, denied school loans, and barred for life from serving on juries, accessing public benefits and even voting. While African Americans make up only about 13 percent of the U.S. population and about 15 percent of drug users, they make up about 38 percent of those arrested for drug law violations and a mind-boggling 59 percent of those convicted for drug law violations. Like Prohibition did for alcohol, drug prohibition is also enriching organized crime. Instead of regulating marijuana to control who can access it, policymakers have ceded control of the $400-billion-a-year global drug market to crime syndicates and thugs. In Mexico, where parts of the country are like Chicago under Al Capone on steroids, 28,000 people have died since President Calderón launched a war three years ago against well-armed, well-funded drug trafficking organizations. The U.S. government doesn't report its prohibition-related deaths, but law enforcement officers, drug offenders and civilians die every day in our country's war on drugs, too. It is long past time to abandon the silly notion that America can be a drug-free nation. The inconvenient truth in drug policy is that Americans love drugs -- alcohol, caffeine, marijuana, cocaine, and prescription drugs for everything from anxiety to fatigue.  Although some people develop problems with their drug use, most do not. This holds true for both legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco, and illegal drugs like marijuana and cocaine. Decades of evidence shows that the average user of any drug doesn't get addicted and doesn't create problems for anyone else. Obviously, some do. We recognize these facts when it comes to legal drugs. It's why we don't arrest the tens of millions of Americans who drink responsibly, but do arrest people who drive while drunk or get belligerent and start fights. Yet we waste tens of billions of dollars every year arresting Americans for marijuana or other drugs, even when they're not harming anyone. Then we either jam them into overcrowded jails where they take up space that could hold someone who committed a violent offense, or jam them into a treatment program where they take up limited spaces for people who really need help. What matters most is not how many people use marijuana, alcohol or other drugs, but what's the best way to reduce the problems associated with substance misuse without creating more harmful social problems. Drug use rates rise and fall almost independently of what politicians say and do, but criminalizing drug use makes the situation worse. Prohibition doesn't stop drug use; it makes drug use more dangerous while filling prisons with nonviolent offenders and making crime lords rich. With marijuana use among young people rising despite decades of punitive drug policies, policymakers should reform U.S. drug policy. Or maybe voters will reform it for them. In November, California voters will vote on Proposition 19, which seeks to control marijuana like alcohol, redirect police resources toward violent criminals, and end California's embarrassingly racist marijuana enforcement once and for all.  Polling shows support is about 50-50. Even if Proposition 19 loses, it will only be temporary. Support for marijuana legalization is growing, and not just in California. Legalization will happen. It's just a question of how many lives and tax dollars will be wasted before it does. Some vested interests, of course, will fight change until the bitter end. Progress has never been accepted by everyone. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Bill Piper.","Bill Piper: Despite all the arrests and money spent, youth marijuana use is increasing .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The GOP congressman from South Carolina who shouted out during President Obama's health care address to Congress insisted Thursday that his outburst was ""spontaneous."" Rep. Joe Wilson shouts, ""You lie!"" after President Obama denies the health plan would cover illegal immigrants. Rep. Joe Wilson shocked many observers Wednesday night when he shouted, ""You lie!"" after the president denied that health care legislation would provide free coverage for illegal immigrants. Some people using Twitter suggested that Wilson's retort was planned and pointed to a comment the lawmaker posted on Labor Day: . ""Happy Labor Day! Wonderful parade at Chapin, many people called out to oppose Obamacare which I assured them would be relayed tomorrow to DC,"" the tweet from Wilson's account said. However, on the way to his office Thursday morning, Wilson said his outburst wasn't planned. ""It was spontaneous. It was when he stated, as he did, about not covering illegal aliens, when I knew we had those two amendments, and I say that respectfully,"" Wilson said. He was referring to two amendments on one version of proposed health care legislation, which he said would have provided for verification of citizenship. Both of the amendments were defeated, he said. Fact check: Will plan cover illegal immigrants? Wilson also cited a report by the Congressional Research Service that he said showed the health care proposals would include illegal aliens. ""And I think that is wrong,"" he said. ""We need to be discussing issues specifically to help the American people. And that would not include illegal aliens. These are people -- I'm for immigration -- legal immigration. I've been an immigration attorney. But people who have come to our country and violated laws, we should not be providing full health care services,"" he said. A CNN review of the Congressional Research Service report found that the health care legislation does address illegal immigrants. It says that noncitizens who can be considered ""resident aliens"" under tax law, which doesn't distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants, would be required to buy health insurance. Yet the proposal clearly says that federal subsidies would go only to U.S. citizens and immigrants who are in the United States legally. Republican congressional leaders told Wilson on Wednesday night that they wanted him to tell the White House that his comments were ""inappropriate,"" Wilson said Thursday.  Watch the lawmaker describe his call to the White House » . Shortly after Obama's speech, Wilson called the White House and issued a statement apologizing for his ""inappropriate and regrettable"" comments. According to Wilson, administration officials said they appreciated his call and emphasized the need for ""a civil discussion."" ""I certainly agree with that,"" Wilson said. Obama told reporters at a Cabinet meeting Thursday morning that he accepted Wilson's apology.  Watch the president say he appreciates the apology » . Democrats and Republicans have criticized the South Carolina congressman for what they described as disrespect for the president.  Watch the outburst and the chamber's response » . Wilson's shout wasn't the only demonstration of displeasure that Republicans made during the speech. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, wore a sign around his neck that said, ""What bill?"" And when Obama asked Republicans to share their ideas to overhaul health care, a small group raised up a stack of papers above their heads. iReport.com: ""You are disrespectful, sir"" After the speech, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the Republican presidential candidate last year, called Wilson's outburst ""totally disrespectful"" and said he should apologize. McCain told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" there was ""no place for it in that setting or any other and he should apologize immediately."" Other Republicans also criticized Wilson, along with the expected Democratic condemnation. ""It was crude and disrespectful,"" said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Illinois. ""I think the person who said it will pay a price."" House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-South Carolina, said, ""I was always taught that the first sign of a good education is good manners. I think that what we saw tonight was really bad manners. ""And having a spirited debate is one thing, exercising bad manners is another. That was beyond the pale -- and I would hope that he would publicly apologize on that same floor to the president of the United States for that insult."" And Wilson's outburst may come with a steep political price. iReport.com: Share your take on the speech . The five-term lawmaker represents the 2nd Congressional District, which includes the state capital, Columbia, and stretches to Beaufort and Hilton Head Island. Wilson's likely 2010 Democratic challenger, Rob Miller, has raised more than $200,000 from 5,000 donors since Wednesday night, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said. Miller accused Wilson of ""engaging in childish name-calling and disrespecting our commander in chief."" Wilson's shout prompted Democrats on the Internet to direct donors to Miller's Web site and to a Democratic fundraising site, ActBlue. iReport.com: Share your take on the speech .

"Shellie Zimmerman, the wife of George Zimmerman -- who was acquitted of second-degree murder in Trayvon Martin's death --  pleaded guilty Wednesday to a misdemeanor charge of perjury. She will be placed on probation for one year, is required to perform 100 hours of community service, and must pay court costs. She also must file a letter of apology within 30 days to Judge Kenneth Lester, who presided over her husband's case at the time the perjury was committed. Prosecutors said Shellie Zimmerman lied when she told Lester during an April 2012 bond hearing for her husband that the family was indigent. In fact, they argue, George Zimmerman actually had about $135,000 at the time. Recorded jailhouse phone calls between the couple caught the two speaking in code about their finances. By pleading guilty to a lesser charge of perjury not in an official proceeding, she avoided the original third-degree felony offense -- perjury during an official proceeding -- that could have meant time in prison.

"On Thursday, a major tech company stepped into the middle of a vicious two-month-long battle among video game fans, scholars, developers and journalists over the representation of women in games. Intel has pulled an ad campaign from popular video game news site Gamasutra. The move is in response to a online protest by a group of gamers upset with a column by the site's editor-at-large, Leigh Alexander. A veteran games journalist, Alexander is one of many writers who have recently been critical of parts of the gamer culture and the male-centric ""gamer"" identity. Gamasutra confirmed the action on Twitter, saying ""Yes, our partners at @intel were flooded with complaints over a recent opinion piece, and they did pull an ad campaign."" The tension began in August when critic and academic Anita Sarkeesian released the latest episode in her YouTube show on female tropes in video games. Around the same time, a game designer named Zoe Quinn was attacked online by an ex-boyfriend who claimed she cheated on him with a games journalist. Both women found themselves at the receiving end of graphic threats of violence from defensive gamers and Internet trolls. Sarkeesian contacted the police and had to temporarily leave her home. The backlash against the two soon spread to journalists and others who were critical of the gaming status quo and the way women are treated in the medium. On the other end are gamers who feel their subculture is being threatened. Some game players worry that activists will cause game makers to change their product to please a wider audience. They started rallying under the #Gamergate hashtag. Supporters of the Gamergate movement, who are well organized and driven, say they are actually combating corrupt games journalism. In the case of Alexander, they say her columns were ""offensive"" and ""racist.""

"The Beverly Hills City Council has condemned the government of Brunei for its ""extreme and inhumane"" Sharia laws and urged the nation's sultan to sell ownership of the landmark Beverly Hills Hotel and any other property the Asian country and its ruler  may own in the exclusive community. The council made the declaration in a 5-0 vote Tuesday night, despite 125 workers from the hotel packing the council chambers and expressing concern about their jobs. Several waiters in white coats told the council they, too, didn't like Brunei's laws but they asked why workers should possibly suffer for the City Council's vote of condemnation. ""It strangles our livelihood,"" said Ann Romer, a server in the hotel's Polo Lounge, a renowned gathering spot for Hollywood stars and filmmakers. ""It causes us to be unable to support our families, my children and my sick grandmother in Vietnam."" All the council members empathized with the workers but said they need to take a stand against the Brunei government. ""The evil is clear. The evil exists in the sultan of Brunei and others who believe as he does,"" said Vice Mayor Julian A. Gold, who's also an anesthesiologist. ""We have 600 people who work at this hotel who are truly innocent in this and who could be collateral damage."" The council vote came a day after Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis, led several celebrities in a demonstration across from the famed Sunset Boulevard hotel. They protested the hotel's ownership, which is an investment group controlled by the Sultan of Brunei. In late April, the small Muslim nation on the northern coast of the island of Borneo implemented Sharia law, marked by strong punishments for those found guilty of homosexuality or adultery -- including stoning to death those convicted. The law was praised by the sultan, who isn't just the country's ruler but also a major political and cultural figure. ""We're just making people aware,"" Leno told CNN. ""It's not a political issue. This is not something that's debatable. ... It's people being stoned to death."" In the wake of the protest movement, a number of organizations have moved -- or threatened to move -- events scheduled for the hotel. The resolution approved by the Beverly Hills City Council accuses Brunei of imposing harsh penalties for homosexuality and adultery. That country's recent laws also allow flogging and severing limbs for theft and other offenses, the council asserted. ""The City of Beverly Hills urges the government of Brunei to divest itself of the Beverly Hills Hotel and any other properties it may own in Beverly Hills,"" the approved resolution said. Other celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres and mogul Richard Branson said they won't patronize the hotel or other properties in the Dorchester Collection of luxury hotels, which owns and manages the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Hotel Bel-Air. Leno said he was well aware of how ""a number of people are canceling events at the hotel, and it's all economics,"" he told CNN. But Christopher Cowdray, the Dorchester Collection's CEO, said the celebrities and groups protesting are taking out their anger on the wrong place. ""The actions they're taking are unfounded,"" he said. ""It's going to hurt our employees and this has nothing to do with them whatsoever,"" he said. ""It's not their fight."" The sultan has owned the Beverly Hills Hotel since 1987. The Dorchester Collection was established in 1996 to oversee that hotel and others in its luxury portfolio, including the Hotel Bel-Air, Paris' Plaza Athenee and London's Dorchester. Cowdray said that celebrities wanting to influence politics in Brunei would be better off lobbying the U.S. State Department to take action. At a briefing Monday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said, ""We have very serious concerns."" The Beverly Hills Hotel has been a haven for Hollywood's elite since 1912 -- two years before the City of Beverly Hills was even created.","Beverly Hills City Council votes 5-0 in telling Brunei to get out of town .

"Tea party-backed Mississippi senate candidate Chris McDaniel is weighing whether to challenge the results of his surprising Republican runoff loss to veteran incumbent Thad Cochran. But McDaniel contends Cochran's tactic of courting Democratic support in a crossover primary was misplaced in a GOP election even though state law permits it. In a statement, McDaniel said the move was ""unbecoming."" ""In the case of yesterday's election, we must be absolutely certain that our Republican primary was won by Republican voters,"" he said. ""In the coming days, our team will look into the irregularities to determine whether a challenge is warranted."" Democrats turning out for Cochran is just the tip of the iceberg in an already bizarre race marred by name-calling, mudslinging, allegations of cheating and a break-in at a nursing home where the senator's bedridden wife lives. Cochran was one of two longtime members of Congress who went into Tuesday with their political fates hanging in the balance appear to have survived intra-party challenges. In a high-profile New York primary, U.S. Rep. Charlie Rangel emerged victorious in what he says is his last race, posting a second straight narrow win over the same opponent he faced two years ago when he barely kept his seat in the House. ""I want each one of you to go home and know that this was your victory,"" he told supporters. ""This is your congressman and you can rest assured that all I will be doing is thinking about you and bringing these resources home."" But Rangel's challenger, state Sen. Adriano Espaillat, wasn't conceding on Wednesday. 5 things we learned from Tuesday's primaries . Democrats come out in GOP contest . Mississippi has no recount provisions in its election laws. The only challenge to election results must go through the courts. Mississippi law allows anyone to vote in the runoff, meaning Democrats could go to the polls as long as they hadn't voted in the Democratic primary and didn't plan to vote for their party's candidate in the general election. By CNN's count, about 61,000 more people voted Tuesday than in the primary two weeks ago. Cochran's backers turned to Democrats, especially African-Americans, who make up 37% of the state's population. They actively reminded voters of the senator's work to secure federal funds for programs such as Head Start and certain medical centers in the state. Henry Barbour, who helps run the pro-Cochran group Mississippi Conservatives with his uncle, former Gov. Haley Barbour, said he was proud that his organization was active in the effort to court Democratic voters. ""It just makes sense that you would talk to folks who aren't just like you. I think that's a healthy thing. I think most people in America think that's a good thing,"" he said, arguing that the strategy could be helpful for other Republicans nationwide, especially as the GOP works to rebrand its image. Barbour also dismissed McDaniel's criticism of the strategy, saying his comments were ""hogwash."" ""I'm afraid he's wrong,"" Barbour said. ""People have a right to vote and I'm damn proud to have asked them for their support."" Conservative groups supportive of McDaniel dispatched volunteers to observe poll workers to see if they were turning away those who already showed up in the Democratic primary. But those efforts mobilized groups such as the NAACP, which sent out its own volunteers to look for any signs of voter intimidation or interference. In his victory speech, Cochran seemed to at least wink at the crossover voters, thanking supporters for getting them and his supporters to the polls. ""You are the ones who helped reach all the voters, make sure that they knew that they were important to this election because it's a group effort, it's not a solo,"" he told a victory celebration in Jackson. ""And so we all have a right to be proud of our state tonight. Thank you for this wonderful honor and wonderful challenge that lies ahead."" McDaniel outpolled Cochran by about 1,400 votes in the June 3 primary but was forced into a runoff when he failed to cross the 50% threshold to win outright. 2014 Midterm Elections . Rangel's last dance? Rangel had said win or lose this race was his last campaign. The Korean War veteran was trying to keep from getting pushed out of office by Espaillat, who came within about 1,100 votes of ousting Rangel in the Democratic primary two years ago. Rangel, the former chairman of the tax-writing House Committee on Ways and Means, was forced to step down from that post in 2010, and the House censured him for ethics violations later that year. Just as damaging for Rangel was the redrawing of New York's 13th Congressional District after the 2010 election -- from a Harlem-based, African-American-dominated district to one that now has a Hispanic majority, thanks to shedding parts of Harlem and adding other neighborhoods in northern Manhattan and parts of the Bronx. Rangel, the ""Lion of Harlem"" and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he didn't put up much of a fight in 2012. ""I didn't have a campaign last time. When he told me he was running, I was in Columbia Presbyterian with a viral infection in my spine."" Espaillat said early Wednesday he wasn't giving in until all the votes were counted. He was down by 1,800 votes, with 99% of the precincts counted, according to AP numbers. ""As we learned in 2012, every single vote needs to be counted in this race. Given the thousands of votes outstanding, the people of Upper Manhattan and the Bronx deserve a full accounting of every vote to achieve a complete and accurate tally in this race,"" Espaillat said in a statement. Tea party vs. establishment battle with a twist . Rep. James Lankford easily won Oklahoma's Republican Senate primary in a race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Tom Coburn. He defeated former state House Speaker T.W. Shannon. Coburn's announcement in January that he would step down at the end of the year -- with two years left in his term -- sparked a competitive primary in Oklahoma to replace the conservative senator. There were seven candidates in the race, but the contest turned into a battle between the two front-runners: Lankford and Shannon. For a party looking for more diversity, the 36-year old Shannon, who was the youngest speaker ever of the Oklahoma House, was an attractive choice. He's part Native American and African-American. He was backed by such tea party heroes as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. And some national anti-establishment organizations pumped big bucks into the race in support of Shannon. But many local tea party groups kept their distance, with some questioning Shannon's outsider credentials. In fact, Shannon's no stranger to politics. He worked for Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma and former Rep. J.C. Watts before launching his political career. Lankford, who has risen through the ranks to become Republican Policy Committee chairman -- the fifth-ranking House Republican -- in two terms in Congress, was criticized by many on the right for his vote to raise the debt ceiling. But labeling the Baptist minister with strong social conservative backing as an establishment candidate was a hard case to make. ""The job is clear,"" Lankford repeated throughout his victory speech, ticking off a number of Republican positions on how to fix the economy, including repealing Obamacare, cutting down on environmental regulation and limiting federal spending. ""I was a member of the class of 2010 in the House of Representatives. It was that class that moved Nancy Pelosi back to flying coach again,"" he said. ""If we win in November, I pray we can do this same thing for Sen. (Harry) Reid."" Conceding the race, Shannon said: ""Tonight this campaign is over, but our cause remains and our cause continues. ""We must get rid of Harry Reid. That means we have to send Republicans to the Senate, and that Republican is James Lankford."" Other races on our radar . CNN projects that Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown will win the state's Democratic gubernatorial primary. The two-term lieutenant governor faced off in an ugly primary battle against state Attorney General Doug Gansler and state lawmaker Heather Mizeur. In a state dominated by Democrats, Brown will now be considered the favorite in the general election to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley. Brown was backed by O'Malley, a potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, as well as former President Bill Clinton. Brown will go on to face Republican Larry Hogan in the general election. If he wins in November, Brown would become the third African-American elected governor in U.S. history. â€¢ In Colorado, CNN projects that former Rep. Bob Beauprez will win the GOP primary for governor, topping anti-immigration firebrand Tom Tancredo, a former congressman and presidential hopeful, and two other candidates. Beauprez will face Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper in November. â€¢ And in Florida, Republican businessman Curt Clawson won the special general election to replace embattled former Rep. Trey Radel. Clawson easily defeated Democrat April Freeman and two other candidates in the race for the state's 19th Congressional District. The heavily Republican district runs along Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast from Cape Coral and Fort Myers south to Naples and Marco Island. Clawson will serve out the remainder of Radel's term, which runs through the end of the year. There will be an August primary ahead of November's general election. Radel, a fellow Republican, was arrested last year for cocaine possession, and he resigned from Congress in January.","Six-term Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi, holds off tea party challenger .

"(CNN) -- It began as an attempt to shut up one woman -- a video-game developer who had criticized the entrenched sexism and misogyny in her industry -- by ""slut-shaming"" her and then threatening her. As other women entered the conversation that was spreading across the Web, male gamer bullies organized to stamp them down as well, some of them adopting Gamergate as the rubric for their ""movement."" When the argument finally caught the attention of mainstream media, the controversy was no longer only about the original issues. It had also become about who gets to determine the real meaning of Gamergate. So, what is Gamergate? Explaining it makes Watergate look like a piece of cake. (""You see, kids, burglars broke into Democratic Party offices, and the Republican president tried to cover it up."" Easy!) Not Gamergate. For one thing, unraveling the truth about the 1972 break-in at the Watergate office complex fell to professional journalists and the legal system. For Gamergate -- now a catchall term for a kind of culture war sprung from the gaming world, taking in issues of sexism, free speech, journalistic ethics, identity and more -- the most timely and thoughtful coverage is coming from people who are affected by it. And now that we get to hear every person's voice, online, there is no single national narrator. That means how you explain Gamergate depends on why you think it's worth explaining. For example, just calling it by that name implies that it's about some type of scurrilous behavior, in this case a breach of journalistic ethics (which we'll get to in a minute). Yet, if that's all it were about, it would have sunk without a ripple. After all, there's no evidence that there was any breach, and even if there were, why go after a woman who is a tiny indie game developer instead of the $100 billion mainstream industry that dwarfs Hollywood in its ability to unduly influence society and the media? News: Intel pulls ads over sexism in video game drama . So, if it's not about that, then what is it about? Here are the facts, but they don't tell the whole story. Zoe Quinn is one of the creators of ""Depression Quest,"" an award-winning indie game released in 2013 that, unlike the typical run-and-gun games, puts the player in the text-based shoes of a depressed teenager. About a month ago, an ex-boyfriend claimed the game had gotten a particular good review on a gaming news site only because (the angry ex-boyfriend claimed) Quinn had had sex with the reviewer to further her career -- which Quinn denies. Even though the journalist hadn't actually written a review, and the gaming news site found no wrongdoing, this triggered an avalanche of attacks on Quinn's ethics from some of the Internet's danker forums, including threats of rape and murder. The fury directed at women went beyond Quinn and beyond the Web. In the most visible episode so far, a few days ago Anita Sarkeesian, who in August had released a video about the use and abuse of women in games, canceled a scheduled talk at Utah State University after the school received emails threatening to murder people at the event. Because of the state's open-carry law, the university refused to ban students from carrying guns into the event. Those are the ""newsworthy"" events, but they do little to explain what's happening. For example, with my Hat of Reasonability on, I'm tempted to say ""Of course no one -- gamer or not -- supports anyone threatening rape and mass murder."" But we don't really know that. Even if few would applaud such horrific acts of violence, the meaning of ""support"" is one of the questions raised by Gamergate: These women are being attacked for criticizing mainstream games' diminishment of women, and some of the sites where these discussions have erupted have subcultures of misogyny. That is a type of support that can't be dismissed simply by disavowing those who threaten physical violence. In a brilliant post, the tech writer Kyle Wagner explains why ""stating the facts"" isn't always the same as telling the truth. He says that Gamergate is ""a fascinating glimpse of the future of grievance politics as they will be carried out by people who grew up online"" -- a politics that exploits the ""basic loophole in the system"": ""the press's genuine and deep-seated belief that you gotta hear both sides."" That's why ""a loosely organized, lightly noticed collection of gamers ... have been able to set the terms of debate"" and chase women who speak up into hiding. A recounting of ""the simple facts"" makes this look like a ""he said-she said"" dispute over journalistic ethics. That gives too much credence to what ""he said,"" and, more importantly, distracts attention from the real issues. Laurie Penny's angry and hopeful post puts it all in terms of a larger shift. ""There's a culture war happening right now,"" she begins. ""It's happening in games, in film, in journalism, in television, in fiction, in fandom. It's happening online, everywhere. And everywhere, sexists, recreational misogynists and bigots are losing."" These groups' fear that they are no longer going to be able to shape the story is what has driven ""Gamergate"" -- a term Penny pointedly does not use. ""They can't understand,"" she says, ""why game designers, industry leaders, writers, public figures are lining up to disown their ideas and pledge to do better by women and girls in the future."" They can't understand why the ultra-mainstream Time magazine invited Leigh Alexander -- a technology and culture critic -- to explain Gamergate to its readers. The old forces of assumed privilege are realizing they're losing their grip on our culture. Not immediately. But, if Penny is right, the extremity of their tactics is a tacit admission that the game is over, even as the shouting continues. So, Gamergate has escalated not because, as with Watergate, the ""scandal"" that started it has been discovered to be more extensive than it first seemed, or because there was a cover-up. Before hashtags and the rest of the Web infrastructure, Gamergate would have been an unpleasant story about an angry ex-boyfriend and a woman who wrote a game he didn't like. It would not have scaled up the way it has if we still had the old broadcast filters that presented clean national narratives that adhered to the national fiction that everything was basically OK, because it was OK for the class that got to tell us the news. Those days are gone. Gamergate is one of the clearest examples of what happens now that the forging of the narrative not only occurs in public but becomes part of the event itself. Is Gamergate about game industry corruption? Journalistic ethics? An ex-boyfriend's revenge? About the role of media? Or (as I believe) about our culture's dismal history of dismissing women? You can decide, but in so doing you're taking a side. In the age of the Net and the days of Gamergate, to understand is to take a stand and to explain is to participate.","David Weinberger: Gamergate ""movement"" began as misogyny, became more .

"(CNN)The woman killed in an apparent road rage incident last week returned home to pick up her son and then went back out to find the man now suspected of shooting her, a Las Vegas homicide detective said Tuesday. Tammy Meyers, a 44-year-old mother of four, had been giving her 15-year-old daughter a driving lesson Thursday when she had an encounter with another driver that left her scared and upset, Lt. Ray Steiber told reporters. When she got home, Meyers told her daughter to go into the house, wake up the girl's brother and have him get in the car. Meyers' son Brandon, 22, brought a registered firearm with him. Meyers drove back out of the neighborhood to see if she could find the man, Steiber said. ""The vehicles and persons found each other,"" he said. ""Through the course of them finding each other, at one point Mrs. Meyers was following what we consider a suspect vehicle and then at another point they broke apart and Mrs. Meyers went home."" Shortly after Meyers arrived at her house a second time and got out of her car, a gray or silver sedan pulled into the cul-de-sac and a volley of shots was fired. The son returned fire, Steiber said. Meyers was struck in the head by one bullet and was rushed to the hospital, where she died on Valentine's Day after being taken off life support. Steiber said the family called 911 after Meyers was shot. The driver, described as a man in his 20s to 30, is about 6 feet tall with medium build. He wore a white V-neck T-shirt. Steiber said authorities believe a bullet from the suspect's gun killed Meyers, and not one from the son's firearm. The initial incident came after the suspect was speeding past Meyers as she drove her daughter home from a driving lesson. Seeing the speeding car, the daughter reached over and honked the horn. Steiber said the man pulled in front, stopped his car and came back to the Meyers car. His words scared mother and daughter. They did not say anything to the suspect, Steiber said. Meyers' husband spoke at a vigil for his wife on Tuesday. He said some of the facts in the case were starting to get twisted by the media. ""My son is not an animal. My son is a hero in my book,"" Robert Meyers said. ""There were mistakes like everyone of us have made in our lives. But this particular mistake was made to keep a bigger mistake from happening. And my wife paid the ultimate price for it."" Brandon Meyers said he was trying to protect his family. ""Everyone can think what they have to think,"" the 22-year-old said.  ""I did it for a reason and I'd do it for anyone I loved."" Road rage: Cameras and guns only add to the problem .","Husband of Tammy Meyers says his wife never did anything bad to anyone .

"(CNN)The man identified as the gunman who wounded three people at a Florida State University library mailed 10 packages before the shooting, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service said Friday. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service said the packages sent by Myron May have been collected by investigators. The service determined the contents weren't hazardous. ""The contents of the mailings are being transferred to the FBI for additional analysis,"" Lori J. McAllister said. Joe Paul of Washington, D.C. said that a postal inspector called to let him know he had received a package from May. He was told there was a long letter and a jump drive inside, Paul said. Paul's package from May, a 2005 FSU graduate, appears to be in a standard Priority Mail envelope, based on a photograph Paul said May sent him as confirmation of its mailing. The envelope was scheduled to arrive Friday, Paul said. But he is traveling, and the FBI now has the envelope. Paul told CNN on Friday that May -- who was killed by police during Thursday's shootings -- had asked him and several others for their mailing addresses in a November 15 Facebook message. ""I really thought it was a wedding invitation or something,"" he said. ""On Wednesday at 9:53 (p.m.), he said y'all should receive your packages Friday. Then I went to sleep and woke up to tragedy."" Agents from the FBI's Houston office were in possession of one package, Special Agent Shauna Dunlap said. Its contents aren't being made public, she said. Dunlap said Friday that the Houston package may first go to a lab for analysis, but will eventually go to the Tallahassee Police Department, the lead agency in the investigation of Thursday's shooting. Victim released from hospital . May, 31, fired shots in FSU's Strozier Library around 12:30 a.m. Thursday, wounding three of the 300 or 400 students inside -- one of them critically, police said. Cell phone video posted online captured the moments after the shooting, in which students huddled inside the packed library. Officers who encountered May outside shot him when he refused to drop his weapon, police say. ""The suspect did not comply with the commands and actually shot at one of the officers,"" Tallahassee police spokesman David Northway said. ""They returned fire, and the subject was killed."" Two students wounded in the shooting were hospitalized at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, according to the hospital.  Nathan Scott, who was shot in the leg, was discharged Friday. The other patient was initially was listed in critical condition. The hospital has not updated the victim's condition. The third shooting victim, who was grazed by a bullet, was treated at the scene and not hospitalized. 'Fears of being targeted' Tallahassee police declined to comment on the packages or what they contain. Police Chief Michael DeLeo, did however, tell reporters Thursday that May had a journal and videos in which he ""expressed fears of being targeted and that he wanted to bring attention to this issue of targeting."" A preliminary review of these documents and videos demonstrates ""that Mr. May was in a state of crisis,"" DeLeo said. In September, May called police in Las Cruces, New Mexico, convinced that someone had placed cameras in his apartment and complaining that he was hearing voices through the walls, according to an incident report provided by the department. A month later, his ex-girlfriend called police, saying May believed ""the police are after him and are bugging his phone and car,"" according to another incident report. 'He did his job with distinction' May worked briefly as a felony prosecutor in Dona Ana, New Mexico, District Attorney Mark D'Antonio said. ""He did his job with distinction and honor,"" D'Antonio said. He abruptly resigned on October 16 in a letter that made no mention of any troubles, D'Antonio said. Paul, who knew May from their days at FSU and had kept in touch over Facebook, said he doesn't think May would want to hurt him. He hopes that what's inside the package will shed some light on what happened. ""I hope it's the answer to why,"" he said. CNN's Steve Almasy, Greg Botelho, Faith Karimi, Nick Valencia, Jethro Mullen, Rick Martin, Anjali Tsui, Ed Payne and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","U.S. Postal Inspection Service says Myron May mailed 10 packages .

"(CNN) -- Farrah Franklin, whose claim to fame is five months backing up Beyonce in the band Destiny's Child, was charged with disorderly conduct Sunday. Franklin, 33, told police she planned to sleep in the woods after two pro football players she partied with earlier in the evening kicked her out of a house in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, early Sunday. Da'Quan Bowers, a defensive end for the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Ricky Sapp, a Houston Texan linebacker, called police after she refused ""to calm down"" at Sapp's home early Sunday, the police report said.

Sapp, 27, said that after an evening of drinking on the town, Franklin ""became intoxicated, began acting strange, was yelling, slamming doors,"" the police report said. Franklin ran out of the house when she heard them call police and ""was last seen screaming in the neighbor's yard down the street,"" the police report quoted them saying. The arresting officer wrote that he found Franklin ""laying in a neighbor's yard."" ""I could smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the arrestee's person, her eyes were blood shot and glassy and she was unsteady on her feet,"" the officer wrote. ""The arrestee appeared to be highly intoxicated."" Franklin admitted she had been drinking but denied she used drugs, the report said. ""The arrestee stated she did not have any where else to go and was planning on sleeping in the woods."" Franklin was charged with disorderly conduct and held in the Horry County, South Carolina, jail until she was freed on $280 bail, according to jail records. CNN has been unable to reach Franklin or her representative for comment. But she did post messages on Twitter after her release from jail Sunday evening that were apparently related to the arrest. ""Have a Blessed Sunday my Luvs @ Myrtle Beach International Airport,"" she tweeted. It was accompanied by an Instagram graphic that read ""May the Lord turn all your sour moments into lemonade."" A later tweet said, ""I'm good just hate the dumb media sometimes, but hey this is the job I signed up for."" Franklin, who lives in the Los Angeles area, was a member of the girl group for just five months in 2000.

"(CNN) -- The United States will donate $15 million to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation, pending congressional authorization and appropriations, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Saturday. Speaking at the Schindler Factory Museum in Krakow, Poland, Clinton said the contribution will go to preserve the site of the concentration camp and ""demonstrates America's commitment to Holocaust education, remembrance and research,"" the State Department said. Some 1.1 million people perished at the Auschwitz-Berkenau concentration camp. Because the camp was initially constructed as a temporary place, the buildings and other artifacts at Auschwitz-Birkenau are deteriorating, the State Department said. If approved, the funding would be provided over five years starting in 2012. The United States encouraged other nations to follow suit and contribute to the fund to preserve the site for future generations, the State Department said. More than 1.3 million people visited the museum and memorial at Auschwitz-Berkenau in 2009. Also Saturday, Poland and the United States amended their missile defense agreement, formally aligning with the Obama administration's new plan to protect against attacks on the United States and its allies. ""This agreement marks an important step in our countries' efforts to protect our NATO allies from the threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction,"" a joint statement from both governments said. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed in April by President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev cuts the total number of nuclear weapons held by the United States and Russia by about a third. Specifically, it fixes a ceiling for each country of 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 deployed nuclear delivery vehicles. The United States abandoned the Nixon-era Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty under the Bush administration in 2001 and has been experimenting with missile defense systems extensively since then. While tests of short-range and sea-based systems have been largely effective, longer-range systems aimed at protecting the U.S. homeland have a mixed record of success. The Obama administration scrapped the Bush administration's plan for a European-based missile defense system based in Poland and the Czech Republic, proposing instead a more limited system aimed at defending against possible attacks from rogue states like Iran. Both proposals have drawn opposition from Russia.","NEW: U.S., Poland amend missile agreement .

"GAZA CITY (CNN)  -- Gaza's main hospital, already overloaded with Palestinians wounded in the week-long Israeli air assault, has reached critical mass, according to a Norwegian doctor volunteering at Shifa Hospital. A Palestinian father carries his wounded baby daughter into a hospital in Gaza City Sunday. Word of health facilities being pushed to the limit came as Israel announced on Monday it was opening up border crossings to allow the flow of humanitarian goods into the Palestinian territory. ""The injured patients are mainly civilians, a lot of children with dreadful injuries,"" Dr. Erik Fosse told CNN on Monday, estimating that 20 percent of the more than 500 people dead were children. ""This figure is rising, and I think it has to do with the development of the war as it moves into the city,"" he added.

""We've had a steady stream (of patients) every day, but the last 24 hours has (seen) about triple the number of cases,"" Fosse said late Sunday. Fosse said that he estimated that about 30 percent of the casualties at Shifa Hospital on Sunday were children, both among the dead and wounded. The increase in casualties at Shifa followed Israel's ground incursion into Gaza, which it launched on Saturday night. Fosse said 50 patients were ""severely wounded"" when an Israeli air strike hit a food market in Gaza City.  Watch more about the victims of the conflict » . ""We were operating in the corridors, patients were lying everywhere, and people were dying before they got treatment,"" he said. Palestinian medical officials said Israeli forces have killed 37 Palestinians -- both civilians and militants -- since moving into the territory. With those deaths, at least 507 Palestinians have been killed in the military operation, including about 100 women and children, officials said. In addition, 2,600 Palestinians have been injured, most of them civilians, officials said.  Watch Palestinians describe fearful life in Gaza » . Most of the casualties are a result of the air strikes that preceded Saturday night's ground incursion. Shifa is the main hospital in Gaza City. Other hospitals were unable to treat the wounded because of a shortage of supplies and staff. Israel has said the military operation is a necessary self-defense measure after repeated rocket attacks from Gaza into southern Israel by Hamas militants. Israeli leaders say they are trying to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza. Last week, Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, a psychiatrist who runs Gaza's mental health program, said Gaza was headed for ""a major humanitarian disaster"" unless the fighting ended soon. El-Sarraj told CNN on Sunday that the violence in Gaza is ""the worst he has seen in his life"" and said he believes that, as a result, half of the people in Gaza will suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.  Watch more about the psychological impact of the conflict » . Meanwhile, Israel said Monday it will allow 80 trucks filled with humanitarian supplies to pass into Gaza. Jerusalem has been under intense international pressure to let the goods pass, because of shortages of food, medicines and fuel. Trucks carrying food and medical supplies are expected go through the Kerem Shalom border crossing, while 222,000 liters of diesel fuel will pass through the Hahal Oz crossing, according to an Israeli army spokesman. The announcement came after 25 trucks carrying aid and medical supplies were unable to pass through the Gaza-Egypt border at Rafah on Sunday, CNN's Karl Penhaul reported. An official with the humanitarian group World Vision also confirmed that report, saying, ""Unfortunately today, they closed the border, so no aid entered Gaza today."" ""There are food shortages ... The health system is overwhelmed. The people here don't have electricity,"" added Mohammed El-Halaby, program manager for World Vision, adding that several power lines and water pumps were damaged by last week's air strikes.

"(CNN) -- Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick walked out of prison a free man Tuesday after serving just over 14 months of a 5-year sentence at a state facility in Jackson, Michigan. Kilpatrick had been serving time for violating probation related to a 2008 case against him. The former mayor walked out of the prison and got into a waiting SUV early Tuesday. He was given ""a small amount of cash from the cashier's office"" upon his release, said John Cordell, spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections. Kilpatrick was expected to board a flight to Dallas, where he was to be reunited with his family. He is to check in with a Texas parole officer on his arrival, and he must serve two years of parole, Cordell said. The former mayor pleaded guilty in September 2008 to two felony counts of obstruction of justice stemming from his efforts to cover up an extramarital affair. He also pleaded no contest to charges of assaulting a police officer who was attempting to serve a subpoena on a Kilpatrick friend in that case. He then spent more than three months in jail before being released in February 2009 on five years of probation. He was also ordered to pay restitution as part of his original plea deal. But on May 25, 2010, Wayne County Judge David Groner sentenced Kilpatrick to five years in prison for failing to report assets that could be used to pay the restitution, a violation of his probation. Kilpatrick will be subject to usual restrictions for parolees, plus an order to pay back what his lawyer called $860,000 in restitution. But even if he abides by all these conditions, the former mayor's troubles are not over. He also faces a host of federal charges related to his time as Detroit's chief executive, including racketeering, extortion, bribery and filing false tax returns.

"The law on assisted suicide in Switzerland isn't clear, according to a paper published in the journal Law, Ethics and Medicine on August 20. That's why, the authors say, people from other countries are traveling to the state of Zurich for the ""sole purpose of committing suicide."" They're called suicide tourists. Between 2008 and 2012, 611 ""tourists"" came to Switzerland for assisted suicide, according to the published analysis. They arrived from 31 countries around the world, though the majority were from Germany and the United Kingdom. ""In the UK, at least, 'going to Switzerland' has become a euphemism for (assisted suicide),"" the study authors write. ""Six right-to-die organizations assist in approximately 600 cases of suicide per year; some 150-200 of which are suicide tourists."" This published paper is the result of a pilot study completed for a larger project on assisted suicide in Switzerland being done by experts at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Zurich. Of the 611 assisted suicides identified during the four-year study period, just over 58% were women. The patients' ages ranged from 23 to 97, researchers found, but the average age was 69. Close to half of the patients had a neurological disease. Others stated they had cancer, rheumatic disease or cardiovascular disease. Many had more than one condition. In all but four cases, the assisted suicides were done using sodium pentobarbital. A fatal dose of this drug causes the patient to slip into a deep coma, according to DIGNITAS, a Swiss right-to-die organization that was involved in most of the identified cases.Sodium pentobarbital paralyzes the patient's respiratory system, causing him or her to stop breathing. The total number of suicide tourism cases dropped from 123 in 2008 to 86 in 2009. But the number of cases doubled between 2009 and 2012, to 172. Assisted suicide laws around the globe are in flux as countries debate the pros and cons of allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients, or patients in a lot of pain, die. In Switzerland, the study authors write, there are no rules to regulate under which conditions someone can receive assisted suicide, though medical professional codes allow it in certain circumstances. In Germany, there is no formal legal language in the criminal code about assisted suicide, but doctors are not ethically allowed to help someone commit suicide -- and can be held criminally responsible for not helping a patient if they witness him or her going unconscious. In the United Kingdom, Ireland and France, assisted suicide is illegal, though recent cases have been presented to high courts. ""If Switzerland is happy to continue providing the facility then, however intellectually dishonest it may be to allow her to siphon of all our own English pain, fear, angst and debate, is it likely to do less harm overall than introducing any conceivable assisted suicide law into England,"" medical lawyer Charles Foster wrote in a commentary accompanying the new journal study. An international survey of 12 European countries found the majority of people favor legalizing assisted suicide, according to the study authors. This seems to match opinion in the United States, where four states -- Oregon, Washington, Montana and Vermont -- allow assisted suicide. Opinion: Suicide doesn't set you free . But others have argued that legalizing assisted suicide is not addressing the real issue, which is the need for better palliative care, and that assisted suicide laws would put vulnerable populations at risk. Alison Twycross of London South Bank University, in an editorial accompanying the new study, writes that advocates for assisted suicide often have a friend or relative who experienced a long, painful death. ""So the issue,"" she writes,""may be a need to provide good end-of-life care."" ""We need to start asking questions such as: Is it appropriate to give antibiotics to a terminally ill patient who develops a chest infection? It is possible that a tendency to carry on with curative treatment even in those clearly dying explains the general public's support for (assisted suicide)."" Twycross cites data from Oregon that suggests regulations put in place when assisted suicide was legalized are not always followed. ""Autonomy is important,"" she writes. ""But it could be that, in matters of life and death, you cannot create freedom for the few without taking away adequate safeguards for the many.""","""Suicide tourism"" describes the act of traveling to another country for assisted suicide .
Between 2008 and 2012, 611 people went to Switzerland to commit suicide .
More than half of these were women, many had neurological disorders ."
"Last fall, after I wrote an article about misogyny found on Facebook, people began to send me links to content that they had tried and failed to have removed by the site. Among these was a seven-minute video depicting a gang-rape of a girl by the side of the road and illustrations of an assault posted on Facebook by a man whose victim feared for her life. I began looking more deeply into the subject and more people contacted me. I came across ""humor"" pages with names like ""Raping Your Girlfriend,"" and text and images of popular rape memes depicting about-to-be-raped, incapacitated girls.  There were easily accessed pictures and videos of girls and women frightened, humiliated, bruised, beaten, raped, gang raped, bathed in blood, and, in a recently publicized case, beheaded. In one instance, Facebook declined to remove an image of a woman, mouth covered in tape, in which the caption read, ""Don't tap her and rap her. Tape her and rape her.""  The photo went viral. Facebook's response to readers who reported it read, ""We reviewed the photo you submitted, but found it did not violate our community standards."" This defied reason and Facebook's own terms, which prohibit posts that ""attack others based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or medical condition."" In a widely reported move this week, Facebook, to its credit, changed its response and is improving its efforts to crack down on such content.  I'm recounting here what preceded this decision, because it is instructive both about our culture and what it takes to change it—with this media giant and potentially other sites. Over the past six months I communicated with Facebook employees to understand their process for determining what content met their criteria and on what those judgments were based. At each stage, they were open, clear about their policies and guidelines and their commitment to balancing user safety with freedom of expression. Facebook in fact had in place the formal language of a reasonable content policy geared toward ensuring users' safety, but it was not implementing it effectively.  This failure disproportionately affected girls and women. The only conclusion could be that individual moderators were interpreting the polices in ways that were gender biased. How?  When 16-year-old boys in Chicago feel comfortable sharing their rape of a 12-year-old-girl for status points, when a group of men in Indonesia film their gang-rape of a young woman by the side of the road and post it for hundreds of people to ""like,"" and when content reviewers daily consider these and related images depicting women scared and cowering, bruised and beaten, to be acceptable, it's not a ""glitch"" in the system. It is the system. These images are not created by Facebook. But they regular pass through the Facebook content review process run by people—people whose sexist norms are reflective of the larger culture, and who govern what is ""appropriate."" Last Tuesday, I joined Jaclyn Friedman, executive director of Women, Action & the Media, and Laura Bates, founder of The Everyday Sexism Project, to launch a global campaign to confront institutionalized sexism in media.  We wrote an open letter to Facebook, co-signed by more than 100 organizations, asking the company to take concrete steps to better understand gender-based hate speech on its site and to train people to recognize violence against women as hateful. We encouraged users of Facebook to send messages to its advertisers encouraging them to boycott the social media network until it addressed our concerns.  Over seven days, men and women around the world sent more than 60,000 tweets using the hashtag #FBrape, and 5,000 e-mails to targeted advertisers, 16 of whom withdrew their advertising. In a rare statement on its site on Wednesday, Facebook responded, noting that its ""systems to identify and remove hate speech have failed to work as effectively"" as they would like and they pledging to evaluate and update policies, guidelines and practices relating to hate speech. The company acknowledged  the importance of improving training for content moderators (the focus of our requests), so they are better able to understand gender-based hate. The company said these steps will be taken in collaboration with representatives from Women, Action & the Media, the Everyday Sexism Project and members of our broader community. Why did we focus on Facebook? Because it is a microcosm of a global culture. This week, people have repeatedly asked me, ""Is Facebook sexist?"" ""Is it Facebook's geek boy tech culture?"" No, I suspect that Facebook is no more or less sexist or misogynistic than any other aspect of our culture and media. But unlike culture at large or ""the Internet,"" Facebook created a useful mechanism for change. It wrote rules about speech.  Once Facebook built a structure to review content, it established itself as an arbiter of norms. By doing this, it became a potential agent of positive change for the purposes of confronting historic media imbalances and commonly accepted gender prejudices. It was because Facebook had clearly thought about these topics and invested significant resources in creating a structured and detailed content review process and guidelines for user interactions that we focused on it. No, this is not feminists censoring the Internet. We are only demanding that Facebook apply its existing content policy rules to women fairly. The fact is, the threat of violence silences women every day -- on and offline.  For example, content considered worthy of removal at Facebook for being unsafe must threaten ""imminent harm.""   ""Imminent harm"" is a luxury for women who experience rape and domestic violence as pervasive threats.  The notion of imminent harm will never be equally applicable to men and women as a baseline criterion, as long as we live in a world where women feel far less safe than men. In the United States, for example, men are 25% more likely to feel safe walking in public at night then women are.  We don't live at the OK Corral. What woman can afford to wait until the harm is imminent, when we all adapt our lives to avoid rape and, for one in four or us in the United States, the daily terrorism of abuse? Some 70% of women on the planet will experience violence at the hands of men, most often men they know.  People concerned with the potential loss of free speech on the Internet would do well to reprioritize their efforts on this actual loss of free speech being experienced purely as a function of a human being's sex. Our campaign resonated with so many because we are in the midst of a shifting cultural tide in which gender based violence -- historically kept private -- is better understood as a pandemic problem, including in the public forum of the Internet.  Facebook's response is important and indeed may both represent and reflect a cultural shift.  It's important because Facebook's action represents an open acknowledgment that violence against women is a serious issue -- not openly stated in the past in the context of this content --  and that it deserves serious attention.  Making that acknowledgment an institutional reality is what we will now strive to do.","Soraya Chemaly: Horrid images of women abuse on Facebook sparked drive for change .

"(CNN)An Indiana family is suing a city and the local police after  officers allegedly smashed a car window to stun and arrest a passenger during a traffic stop. The family said police pulled them over because the two front passengers were not wearing a seat belt on September 24 in Hammond, Indiana. Both sides argued they feared for their safety during the traffic stop, which was videotaped by a teenager in the car. The video in question . ""I'm scared for my life,"" Lisa Mahone's voice is heard in a video, speaking from the driver's seat of her car.  In the passenger seat, her partner, Jamal Jones, talks to officers gathered outside his door. His window is rolled down only a few inches. ""I don't know what's going on,"" he says. Joseph Ivy, 14, and Janiya Ivy, 7, are in the back seat. One of them holds a camera and is recording the exchange. ""Are you going to open the door?"" an officer asks Jones. ""How can you say they are not going to hurt you? People are getting shot by the police!"" Mahone says before her voice breaks into screams as an officer smashes the passenger window. Jones joins her screams as his body convulses from the electric shock of the stun gun. Officers then pull him out of the car, handcuff him and take him away. Fear on both sides . Minutes before the incident, the family was driving to the hospital to visit Mahone's dying mother. Hammond Police Officers Patrick Vicari and Charles Turner stopped Mahone because neither she nor Jones wore seat belts, according to Hammond Police spokesman Lt.  Richard Hoyda. The officers placed spike strips under the car's wheels and approached Mahone. Mahone ""informed the officers that her mother was dying and that (they) were on the way to the hospital to see her before she died,"" read the complaint. ""Rather than issuing Lisa (Mahone) a ticket for failure to wear a seat belt, the officers demanded that Jamal (Jones), the passenger, provide the officers with his identification as well."" But Jones didn't have an identification. He had previously turned over his license for an unrelated citation. ""Jamal offered to show the officers the ticket, which had his information on it but the officers refused,"" read the complaint. Police however tell a different story. Call to 911 . Jones refused to identify himself and repeatedly ignored requests to step out of the car after officers feared he had a weapon, Hoyda said. ""The first officer saw the passenger inside the vehicle drop his left hand behind the center console inside of the vehicle. Fearing for officer safety, the first officer ordered the passenger to show his hands and then repeatedly asked him to exit the vehicle,"" Hoyda said. Meanwhile, Mahone was on the phone with a 911 operator requesting to speak to a supervisor. 'Fear for their safety' Mahone, Jones and the children ""were in reasonable fear for their safety,"" read the complaint. ""After a minute or two for no reason, the officers drew their weapons."" At this point Mahone is heard pleading with someone in the video. ""He (Jones) is looking for his information in his book bag. When he goes into his book bag, they pull a gun out. What was the purpose of a gun? And now they ask me to open my door so I can get out. I'm scared. If you can pull out a gun in front of ... there is two kids in the back seat."" Both the Police Department and Hammond are standing by the officers. ""Police officers who make legal traffic stops are allowed to ask passengers inside of a stopped vehicle for identification and to request that they exit a stopped vehicle for the officer's safety without a requirement of reasonable suspicion,""  Hoyda said. Hammond Mayor Thomas M. McDermott Jr. cited two recent police officer deaths in Indiana as the reason for heightened precautions. ""While I hope that situations like this one can be avoided in the future, I am standing solidly behind the actions of these police officers,"" McDermott said. Mahone was cited for failure to wear a seat belt and a license plate reciprocity violation. Jones was arrested for failure to aid an officer, resisting law enforcement and was also cited for a seat belt violation, according to Hoyda. Lawsuit . In a lawsuit filed this week in the Northern District Court of Indiana, Mahone, Jones and the two children accuse the city, Vicari, Turner and ""other unknown officers"" of excessive force, false arrest and imprisonment, assault and battery, and Intentional infliction of emotional distress. Hammond Police directly all media inquiries to the law firm Eichhorn & Eichhorn, LLP. CNN called the firm and asked whether they were representing Hammond Police regarding the September incident. An unidentified woman said ""that's true and we have no comment."" CNN attempted to contact Turner and Vicari, but was unsuccessful. Using Taser on an 8-year-old? Mom sues police, city . Who recorded the incident? ""That incident further magnifies what took place in Ferguson, the use of excess force that seems to be happening across the breath and width of this nation,"" said NAACP Board Member John Gaskin. ""As a man of color, if I'm pulled over, I will be leery of the officer and obey whatever commands they are giving me because at this point you are fearful of your life"" It was fear that led one of the children in the back seat, Joseph, 14, to begin recording the incident. ""The kids and the family had seen all the news of officers engaging in excessive force and were concerned for their safety,"" family attorney Dana Kurtz told CNN affiliate WLS. The children were ""horrified,"" said Kurtz. ""They received glass shattered into the back seat, they had cuts in their arms. Not only were they harmed physically but they were harmed emotionally as well."" ""They were scared. Their perception of officers, of police officers who were supposed to be serving and protecting not only them, but us, everyone, has been tarnished for the rest of their lives,"" said Kurtz. Florida officer on paid leave after using Taser on 61-year-old woman . 'Open dialogue' A sentiment that judging by the recent events in Ferguson, Missouri, is echoed by many. The  August fatal shooting of Michael Brown in that city led to days of  violent protests in Ferguson. ""Just because the police could do it, doesn't mean they should. My question here is the judgment that they used smashing that window with the kid in the car and four passengers in that car if there could have been another way to get around that,"" said CNN law enforcement analyst, Tom Fuentes . The mayor said he acknowledged ""the importance of being sensitive to differing points of views, amongst our diverse community, in regards to actions taken by our police department."" ""As always, I will continue to encourage open dialogue on this and any issue that may affect relations between city government and members of our community,"" he said. However, he concluded, he believes ""when drivers get pulled over, whether they agree with the reason for the stop or they don't, you must comply with lawful requests of the police.""

"(CNN) -- A story about Pope Francis allegedly saying animals can go to heaven went viral late last week. The problem is that it wasn't true. Many erroneous news reports on this incident relied on an article that appeared in The New York Times. That article alleged that the Pope, at a general audience at the Vatican, comforted a boy whose dog had died by saying: ""One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God's creatures."" This was not what happened, and in a (frankly, embarrassing) correction now appended to that flawed article, the Times points out: ""The article also misstated what Francis is known to have said. According to Vatican Radio, Francis said: 'The Holy Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us,' which was interpreted to mean he believes animals go to heaven.""' So: Wrong and wrong again. But even the correction at the Times and elsewhere (including this news site) did little to stop the initial report of the story from zinging around the Internet and giving new, unfounded hope to animal lovers everywhere. This fiasco illustrates three things: . First, while I know it's tempting to write punny headlines like ""Dogs in heaven? Pope Francis leaves Pearly Gates open,"" news organizations that ran the erroneous account really should hold fact checking to a higher standard. Note to writers: Don't rely on People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals as a source for papal quotes. Second, part of the reason this story caught fire is that it sounds like something Pope Francis would say. In his two years as the leader of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church, Francis (who took the name of St. Francis, the church's patron saint of animals) has prioritized the lowly. By extension, he must love puppies and kitties, right? As David Gibson of Religion News Service points out, this isn't the first time such a myth about this Pope has spread. Last year, news reports said he was sneaking out of the Vatican at night to feed the homeless around Rome. A nice thought but also not true. ""The media and the public are so primed for Francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out; it fit with the pattern,"" Gibson writes. The ""animals can go to heaven"" meme also paints Francis as a stirrer of theological controversy, which brings me to my third point: People have strong feelings about whether they will spend the afterlife with their deceased, beloved pets. This is where I should be honest and admit I'm not the world's biggest animal lover. A bite when I was a young child instilled a lasting fear of most dogs, especially big ones. But I have loved some animals, including my sister's dog, Buddy, who died earlier this year. Lots of friends tried to comfort her with the ""rainbow bridge"" story, which says that animals wait in a heaven-like place to be reunited with their owners in the hereafter. This is definitely not Catholic teaching, but its popularity reveals the desire of people to believe that their pets' lives have meaning. While the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which contains official church teaching, does not address the issue directly, it does make clear that animals do not have the same immortal souls of humans and thus would not be eligible to enter the Pearly Gates, so to speak. The catechism says we should not mistreat animals, but points out that God made them for humans' stewardship and that we should not ""spend money on them that should as a priority go to the relief of human misery. One can love animals; one should not direct to them the affection due only to persons."" The quote that ""paradise is open to all of God's creatures,"" which was mistakenly attributed to the current Pope, is now being attributed by the Times and others to a previous one, Paul VI, who died in 1978 -- although the attribution here is also not particularly decisive. Even if it were, just because a pope says something doesn't mean church teaching has changed. My apologies to all the animal rights activists, vegans and everyone who has ever lost a pet who got so excited yesterday. While Catholics believe that their leader is infallible, that doctrine is a lot more complicated than meaning that everything that comes out of the Pope's mouth is the gospel truth. Also, it's important to note that Paul VI's alleged comments apparently were in response to a young boy whose dog had recently died. In the Catholic Church, we call that being pastoral. In other words, the Pope was trying to comfort the boy and provide solace, not doctrinal instruction. What is true is that Francis has been vocal about the importance of caring for creation. The source of this whole controversy was a late November talk about how the End Times will result in a ""new creation."" But neither he nor Pope Paul VI went so far as to ascribe eternal souls to animals that would be comparable to humans. But, as this whole incident illustrates, people will believe what they want to believe.","Heidi Schlumpf: News reports said Pope told boy dogs go to heaven; report proved untrue .
Story went viral because it fit pattern of pronouncements many expect of Pope Francis, she says.
Claims are that Paul VI said something more like that, not Francis, she says. Either way ...

"Toronto's mayor has purportedly been filmed on cellphone video smoking crack cocaine, the Toronto Star reported. The footage appears to show Rob Ford ""sitting in a chair, wearing a white shirt, top buttons open, inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe,"" the newspaper says. Two of the newspaper's reporters were shown the footage May 3 by someone who claims to have supplied the crack and shot the video. This person told the Star that they have previously given the mayor crack. The reporters watched the video three times. The newspaper reports that the 90-second video allegedly shot last winter shows Ford ""incoherent, trading jibes with an off-camera speaker who goads the clearly impaired mayor by raising topics including Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and the high school football team Ford coaches."" ""I'm f---ing right wing,"" Ford seems to mutter, the report says. ""Everyone expects me to be right wing. I'm just supposed to be this great ... "" The newspaper says that the mayor appears to refer to the players on the football team as ""just f---ing minorities."" The Star claims the video ends when the smartphone rings and the mayor says, ""That phone better not be on."" Read the Star's story about the cellphone video . The video is being shopped around by a group of men involved in the drug trade, the Star reported Thursday. The newspaper says that it has no way to verify the authenticity of the tape, and reports that its attempts to get comment from the mayor or his staff Thursday about the video were unsuccessful. Thursday night, Ford's chief of staff, Mark Towhey, would not listen to questions by the Star and hung up on a reporter, the newspaper reports. CNN cannot confirm the video's authenticity. Ford spoke Friday morning to reporters, but did not answer questions. He denied allegations, calling them ""ridiculous"" and ""not true."" CNN has calls into the mayor and the mayor's lawyer, Dennis Morris. Also Thursday, the news site Gawker also ran a story about the video. A Gawker journalist says he was contacted by a tipster who described the tape, and the Gawker reporter flew to Canada to see the video in person. The journalist met with two men, one of whom showed the video -- still on the phone -- to the journalist, and then demanded money for the tape. The Gawker reporter did not pay for it and the man with the phone took off. Morris called Gawker's report ""false and defamatory,"" the Star reported. Morris told the Star that it's impossible to know from watching a video what a person is actually smoking or drinking. By Friday morning, reporters swarmed Toronto's City Hall hoping to interview the mayor, but instead interviewed deputy mayor Doug Holyday about the allegations. Holyday, the mayor's closest political ally, said he had not heard from the mayor Friday and didn't know where he was. A reporter asked Holyday whether he believes the allegations are false. ""I hope so,"" he replied. The mayor should address the accusations ""sooner than later,"" he said. ""I would advise the mayor to speak to the media but I think he has to do it in a prepared way."" Another reporter asked whether the scandal makes it possible Ford to continue to govern. Holyday said he still has confidence in Ford, but said that he is willing to step up and replace the mayor if that becomes necessary. Regardless, the scandal is hurting the city's reputation as the Star and Gawker's coverage is reposted around the world, the deputy mayor said. ""Whether you can blame the mayor or not blame the mayor depends on whether the story is true,"" Holyday said. ""I don't know that and I don't know that any of you do."" He added: ""Certainly we all know that videos can be altered and we certainly know that drug dealers can't be trusted."" Read the Star's coverage of Holyday's reaction . CNN has been trying to interview the mayor for several months regarding the recommendation that Toronto create supervised injection centers for drug addicts.

"Brian Banks was on ""Cloud 10"" Friday, the first full day of the rest of his life, after he was exonerated of a rape he did not commit. ""Today, it started to sink in a little more,"" Banks told CNN's Ashleigh Banfield. ""I am overwhelmed. I feel great."" At age 17, fearing a potentially long sentence, the college football prospect followed the advice of his attorney and pleaded no contest to assaulting a Long Beach, California, high school classmate in 2002. Banks maintained his innocence throughout nearly six years of imprisonment, subsequent probation and registration as a sex offender. The case took an incredible twist when the alleged victim sent a Facebook friend request to Banks in early 2011. According to the California Innocence Project, the woman later admitted that Banks had not kidnapped or raped her during a consensual encounter at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where Banks was a middle linebacker with a scholarship offer from the University of Southern California. An emotional Banks, 26, lowered his head and fought back tears Thursday when prosecutors said they were moving to have the conviction dismissed. ""We do not believe Mr. Banks did the crime he pled guilty to,"" Deputy District Attorney Brentford Ferreira said after court. ""Justice has been served."" A judge concurred and tossed the conviction. Time doesn't pay, wrongfully imprisoned find . ""I was overcome with relief but reminded of the pain and suffering I went through in prison and parole,"" Banks said. ""All the false accusations against me."" Banks put bitterness aside, though, expressing no interest in taking legal action against the woman who recanted. ""For me, I just want to be positive. I want to be in a better position than what I was yesterday,"" Banks said. ""The only way that can happen is by eliminating any negative ill will or feelings toward anyone."" The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said Friday that it is not currently involved in any investigation of the woman. ""Our standard is beyond a reasonable doubt,"" spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said, referring further questions to Long Beach police. Police spokeswoman Lisa Massacani said Friday that there was no current investigation. According to CNN Los Angeles affiliate KTLA, the accuser won a $1.5 million settlement in a civil suit against the Long Beach Unified School District. She claimed that the school's lax security provided an unsafe environment that led to the alleged rape. It was not clear whether the school district will try to recoup any of the settlement. A message seeking comment was not immediately returned. The California Innocence Project took up Banks' case and went to court on his behalf, saying he and the woman never had sexual intercourse. The alleged victim expressed concern about having to return money she received in the civil suit, the group said. The group's director, Justin Brooks, said the Banks case is not uncommon. ""Plea bargains have become the 95% solution."" ""Brian has learned that anger is going to eat you up,"" Brooks said. ""If we hadn't gotten that recantation, Brian would have gone through this the rest of his life."" Although he did not have the opportunity to play college football, Banks maintains a dream of playing for the National Football League. ""I'm hoping to draw the attention of some team that takes interest in my story, takes interest in my hard work and gives me an opportunity,"" he told KTLA.","Judge tosses conviction of man who pleaded no contest to rape charge .

"Krotz Springs, Louisiana (CNN) -- The Nolan family spent the last few days packing up their belongings, moving out furniture, helping relatives and praying for a miracle in the face of the rising, menacing waters of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers. By Sunday, they had a few things they still had to do: clear out their trailer home in the Halphen Hollow subdivision of Krotz Springs, Louisiana, in order to head to higher ground ahead of the 5 p.m. mandatory evacuation deadline, and find a way to celebrate their daughter Mayah's fourth birthday. Louisiana residents rush to get out of flood's path . So, after all the frantic last-minute preparations were complete, Jake Nolan finally made it to a nearby grocery store to get a cake. It was in hopes of giving Mayah a little bit of sunshine during what her father has described as a terrifying experience. ""She can't swim, and she hears all the stories about the water rising,"" Jake Nolan said. ""She is scared she won't be able to make it out."" The Nolans aren't alone. They are among 750 people in low-lying areas around Krotz Springs who were ordered to leave after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers authorized the opening of floodgates on the Morganza Spillway. The aim is to minimize greater devastation further downriver, in cities like Baton Rouge and New Orleans. But the consequence is that as many as 4,000 people, according to Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, could have their homes submerged as waters are funneled into the Atchafalaya River Basin, between that river and the Mississippi. That includes the town of Krotz Springs, about 20 miles southwest of Morganza. This area is the first with a significant population seeing the rising water after this past weekend's opening of four floodgates at the Morganza Spillway. Spillways explained . Jake Nolan said Sunday that he, his wife and their three children moved into the subdivision two months ago. Now, they are frantically preparing to move out -- heading to Jake's sister's house until the floodwaters recede. ""We just moved in here, and now we're in the process of moving everything out,"" said Nolan, 23. ""I have no choice. If not, I'm going to lose everything."" Handling the logistics of a last-minute move is one thing. But as challenging is explaining what's happening, and why, to a young child. Nolan said his daughter Mayah has ""heard the stories of the snakes and the alligators and everything else that's liable to come up the river."" ""She doesn't really understand,"" her father said. Brett Ansley, a Krotz Springs native, is also trying to come to grips with the Corps' decision that has turned his life upside down. Stars talk about flooding and the response . By day, he's an inspector at an oil refinery, checking pipes and welding. But now he has put that and everything else on hold, as he hitched up his trailer home to his truck in order to head to higher ground. Asked about the approaching waters, the first words that sprang to Ansley's mind were ""crazy"" and ""unreal."" ""It's a lot of water that's going to be coming around here,"" the 24-year-old said. His great-grandmother was in Krotz Springs for the great flood of 1927, which inundated 165 million acres, killed 246 people and left another 600,000 homeless throughout the Mississippi River system, according to a National Weather Service report. That flood, ironically, spurred the creation of the Corps of Engineers, empowering them to create systems to guard against further calamities -- and giving them the authority to let waters flow from some levees to wash away some areas in order to spare others. This, of course, is what's happening with Krotz Springs, Melville and other communities nearby. Ansley recalls his grandfather, too, telling him about the historic 1937 flood. The family stuck around the southeastern Louisiana community, but he's not sure what will happen when the floodwaters finally subside this time around. ""I don't know who's going to come back, who's going to stay gone,"" he said. ""It won't be the same. I'd like to come back, but we'll have to wait and see what happens.""","Hundreds in Louisiana's Atchafalaya River basin have been ordered to evacuate .
""We just moved in here and now we're in the process of moving everything out""

"It's been a tension-filled week for travelers used to flying safely around the world. The shooting down of a commercial flight over Ukraine and a rocket strike near Israel's gateway international airport have made people keenly aware of the risks of flying through conflict zones. Safe airspace is top of mind for people considering trips to troubled spots and those just hoping to get home sooner rather than later. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed in eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 people aboard. U.S. intelligence officials say that pro-Russian rebels were responsible for shooting down the commercial airliner traveling from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They now believe the rebels probably didn't know that it was a commercial airliner, officials said earlier this week. On the day of the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a notice prohibiting U.S. flight operations in the airspace over eastern Ukraine until further notice, widening an April ban on flights over the Crimea region. Less than a week later, a rocket strike about a mile from Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, prompted the FAA to prohibit U.S. airlines from flying into the airport. The ban lasted about a day and a half and was lifted Wednesday night. European aviation authorities also moved to ease their recommendation urging carriers to avoid the region. A crash of a plane attempting to land in Taiwan in heavy rain Wednesday that killed at least 48 on board and reports Thursday of the apparent crash of an Air Algerie flight carrying 116 people have delivered two more blows to a tragic seven-day period. The unusual string of events has travelers worried. ""I never had a reason to think I was flying over a war zone where missiles might be flying,"" said Elizabeth Bratt, 34, an American living in Taiwan, who is planning to travel to Europe and the Middle East in the fall. ""I would have trusted an airline to avoid such an area."" Israel-Gaza conflict felt around the world . The concern over routes doesn't surprise aviation security consultant Jeff Price. ""Most travelers were only mildly concerned about where their flights were going prior to the Malaysia flight,"" Price said. ""Many are probably more concerned about it now. I know I would be, and I would definitely be concerned about anything flying over an 'act of war' zone."" Or into a war zone. The FAA ban on U.S. airlines flying into Tel Aviv -- now lifted -- followed on the heels of a State Department travel warning about the region. It advised Americans to consider deferring nonessential travel to Israel and the West Bank and reaffirmed existing guidance against any travel to Gaza. Other countries are cautioning their citizens against some travel to the region. Tourism taking a hit . The escalating violence and resulting travel restrictions have translated into tourists starting to avoid Israel. With about 8 million people, Israel welcomed a record 3.5 million visitors last year and a record 1.4 million for the first half of 2014, according to the country's Central Bureau of Statistics. The country's largest airport, Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion, handled a record 14.3 million passengers in 2013, up 8% from 13.1 million passengers in 2012, according to Airports Council International, a trade group. (Israel has six commercial airports, two of which handle international traffic.) Israeli tourism had already been affected by the conflict, and the FAA's flight ban had further impact. Hotel occupancy in central cities dropped to 50%, according to Yossi Fatael, managing director of the Israel Tourist and Travel Agents Association. Since July 15, the number of visitors cutting short their visits increased from 25% to 40%. ""The accumulating damage figure is some $500 million,"" Fatael said. Should the conflict clear up in the next few days, Fatael said, the overall damage might be lighter than expected. If it continues, he couldn't speculate on the long-term impact on Israeli's tourism industry. There's never been an event that affected tourism in Israel to this level, he said, in part because of the timing. ""During the Gulf War in 1991, the situation was somewhat similar,"" Fatael said.  ""Yet it was in January and not during the height of tourism season."" Travelers reassess plans amid Mideast conflict . Still trying to get to Israel . Gil Travel was still sending tour groups to the Middle East, its owner said Wednesday. The Philadelphia-based company had tour groups scheduled to fly into Israel on Wednesday night. Working with El Al airlines, Gil Travel was able to get more than 100 passengers switched to flights that would take them from New York to Israel. ""Same goes the other way,"" owner Iris Hami said before the ban was lifted. ""Those who need to leave from Israel will fly out El Al or stay late."" Hassan Khawaled, a tour guide with travel group Ahalan Olympus, had a group of students scheduled to fly into Tel Aviv on Wednesday for an Islamic-focused tour of Israel. Since their flights were canceled, the Israel-based agency flew them into Jordan and drove into Israel, he said. Many flights soar over conflict zones . Travelers are trying to get home . Many travelers already in Israel had cut their trips short and headed home before the FAA ban. ""For our clients traveling in Israel, we assisted the majority of them in returning home days ago,"" said Peter Vlitas, senior vice president of Protravel International. ""While we have a few still there now, we are working to get them home via Europe. Also, we proactively contacted all clients scheduled to travel to Israel in the next 30 days and advised them of the situation and the refund policies of the airlines."" Travelers in Israel have been finding help from the tourist association and some airlines. United Airlines is providing ""hotel, meal and transportation accommodations for our Tel Aviv customers impacted by the cancellations,"" a spokeswoman said. Atlanta rabbi Joshua Lesser traveled to Israel on July 10, joining a two-week reconstructionist rabbinic study mission to learn about the Middle East conflict from members of the region's diverse communities. His Wednesday flight home on Delta Air Lines was canceled after the first FAA ban was announced. Lesser, rabbi of Congregation Bet Haverim in Atlanta, has some perspective. He has taken cover in bomb or makeshift shelters several times since he arrived. ""I have listened to the trauma that Israelis experience feeling like their existence is threatened and the fear of the air raid sirens and loss of life, and I have listened to Palestinians and Israeli Arabs talk about the injustices they face at checkpoints, their limited movement. This is no way for people to live long term. ""This is a small taste of how people's lives and plans are derailed every day,"" he said . Planning on going to Israel?

"Amid mounting international pressure, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan spoke Sunday about his government's efforts to rescue more than 200 schoolgirls abducted by militants. ""Wherever these girls are, we'll get them out,"" he said, acknowledging that officials don't know where they are. The President criticized the girls' parents for not cooperating fully with police. ""What we request is maximum cooperation from the guardians and the parents of these girls. Because up to this time, they have not been able to come clearly, to give the police clear identity of the girls that have yet to return,"" he said. Protesters took to the streets over the weekend. On Sunday, about 100 demonstrators gathered outside the Nigerian High Commission in London again, where they chanted  ""Bring them back!"" as well as ""Not for sale!"" and ""African lives matter!"" The mainly female crowd, from young girls to older women, also carried banners that read ""These are our sisters"" and ""No child born to be taken."" ""It's very important that everyone do something,"" London teacher Leyla Chery, who attended the demonstration with her 8-year-old daughter, told CNN.  ""We have ways to find the girls, but we haven't done enough and the government in Nigeria hasn't done enough. So we should definitely try to push them. I talk to my students in class about the girls."" Crowds from Los Angeles to London rallied on Saturday, carrying posters reading #BringBackOurGirls -- a campaign that began on Twitter after the mass abduction of the girls by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram last month. In Washington, protesters gathered at the Lincoln Memorial to denounce what they described as a poor response by the Nigerian government to rescue the girls. The social media campaign has gained momentum with celebrities, such as singer Mary J. Blige, offering their support. Education advocate and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who made a miraculous recovery after being shot in the head by the Taliban, posed in a picture with the #BringBackOurGirls poster. On Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on Nigeria's President to step up efforts to find the girls, who were kidnapped April 14 from a school in Chibok, in the country's rural northeast. Boko Haram: A bloody insurgency, a growing challenge . Anger has been mounting in Nigeria over the lack of information about what efforts are under way to secure the girls' release. Many contend authorities are not doing enough and have taken to social media using hashtags #BringBackOurGirls and #BringBackOurDaughters to demand more from the government, a move that appears to have ignited a global call for action. Nigeria's Defense Ministry has said it is committed to the search. In London, Matilda Egere-Cooper, one of the organizers of Sunday's protest, said she wanted to raise awareness about the ""disastrous"" situation in Nigeria. ""I think its so important that the Nigerian government do a lot more in finding these women,""  Egere-Cooper, herself of Nigerian origin, told CNN. ""We are here today to lend our support in making sure that the girls are returned to their family. We also want to bring attention to women being in the center of various conflicts, wars that are happening around the world. We don't think it's right."" Speaking during a visit to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, Kerry called on the government to bring those responsible to justice. ""The kidnapping of hundreds of children by Boko Haram is an unconscionable crime, and we will do everything possible to support the Nigerian government to return these young women to their homes and to hold the perpetrators to justice,"" he said. Boko Haram's name translates to ""Western education is a sin,"" and the group especially opposes the education of women. Under its version of Sharia law, women should be at home raising children and looking after their husbands, not at school learning to read and write. According to accounts, armed members of Boko Haram overwhelmed security guards at the all-girls school in Chibok, pulled the girls out of bed and forced them into trucks.  The convoy of trucks then disappeared into the dense forest bordering Cameroon. On Friday, Nigerian authorities updated the number of girls kidnapped to 276. At least 53 of the girls escaped, leaving 223 in the hands of their captors, police said. Authorities said that the new figure for missing girls -- 223 -- could grow as police fill in spotty school enrollment records.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Crimea on Friday to take part in Victory Day celebrations in Sevastopol, in what is his first visit to the disputed territory since Russia annexed it from Ukraine. The President arrived in the port of Sevastopol by sea, in an event televised by Russian state TV, and watched while flanked by senior officers as Russian warships took part in a naval display in the Black Sea. The military parades, held each year to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany, come amid soaring tensions in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists are planning a weekend referendum on autonomy. At least seven people were killed and 39 others were injured in clashes between separatists and Ukrainian government forces in the flashpoint southeastern city of Mariupol, the Donetsk regional health department said Friday. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov put the toll higher in a post on his official Facebook page, saying about 20 militants had been killed and four captured, while one member of the armed forces was dead and five injured. In Washington, the White House took notice of Putin's visit and reiterated its rejection of Crimea's annexation. ""Such a visit will only serve to fuel tensions,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Laura Lucas Magnuson said. In Sevastopol, which hosts a key Russian naval base, crowds packed the shores to witness the show of Russia's military might. Besides the warships that took part in the sea, dozens of military aircraft roared overhead. Putin paid tribute to Sevastopol's long military record as he addressed servicemen in the harbor, and he said he was sure that 2014 would become known in history as the year Crimea's people decided to return to Russia and the memory of their ancestors. ""There is a lot of work to be done, but we will overcome all the difficulties because we are together. This means we have become even stronger, and I congratulate you on the great victory,"" he said. Putin shook hands with servicemen after his remarks, before walking to barriers where he was greeted by screaming crowds. An earlier military parade by land vehicles through the city also attracted big numbers, with the turnout probably boosted by rumors that Putin might attend. The Russian President's first Victory Day appearance was in Moscow, where the annual display of nationalistic fervor was heightened by Russia's annexation of Crimea. Tanks, rocket launchers and even intercontinental ballistic missiles were paraded through the capital's Red Square in a Soviet-style show of military might, as tens of thousands of people watched and cheered, waving Russian flags. In televised remarks there, Putin hailed his nation's ""all-conquering patriotism."" Gunfire, smoke in Mariupol streets . Meanwhile, a live video stream from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol showed a tense situation with gunfire and black smoke in the streets. Avakov, on his Facebook page, said about 60 ""terrorists,"" armed with automatic weapons, had launched an attack on Mariupol's police department. This turned into a ""full-scale military clash"" inside the building, he said, with army, national guard and special forces units involved. As a result, he said, ""a significant part of the terrorist group has been destroyed."" Others had abandoned their weapons and disappeared into residential areas, he said. The municipal building is in flames, he added. Earlier, a member of parliament posted on his Facebook account that separatists had blockaded themselves inside the police headquarters, surrounded by Ukrainian forces. Three ""casualties"" were reported among the separatists, and some Ukrainian officers were hurt, lawmaker Oleg Lyashko said. CNN is not able independently to verify either account at this time. Live video from Mariupol showed what appeared to be bloody footprints and blood splatters at several scenes in the city center, while people were taking cover at the sound of what appeared to be bursts of gunfire. Irina Voropaeva, who is one of the leaders of the pro-Russian camp in Mariupol, told CNN there were two hotspots in the city. She said it was unclear what was unfolding at the main police station. But, she said, the Ukrainian military is in the city center and she had been told that the city hall building is on fire. She added that she could see smoke and hear explosions. Mariupol has become a flashpoint in the standoff between Ukrainian forces and the separatists. Five pro-Russian activists were killed overnight Wednesday when Ukrainian forces attacked barricades on the outskirts of Mariupol, a spokeswoman for the pro-Russian camp said. Ukrainian forces also continue to surround the town of Slovyansk, a stronghold for pro-Russian militants. Chaotic transition . A large majority in Sevastopol, as well as across the Crimean Peninsula, voted in favor of seceding from Ukraine and joining Russia in a controversial referendum in March. Moscow's annexation of the Black Sea territory, which was part of Russia until 1954 and has a majority ethnic Russian population, soon followed. Sevastopol residents told a CNN team early Friday that they were proud and happy to be part of Russia again. Their enthusiasm comes despite a messy, sometimes chaotic, process of transition and the continued presence on the streets of local ""self-defense"" units, or militias, known as the ""men in green."" Not everyone is delighted by Russia's annexation of Crimea, however. The indigenous ethnic minority Tatar population opposed the move. One local Tatar leader, Abduraman Egiz, told CNN he was beaten up by a group of ""men in green"" after they demanded to see his identification documents. ""We as the community, we cannot guarantee the security of our people,"" he said. Authorities in Ukraine scaled back Victory Day events in the capital, Kiev, and elsewhere, anxious to avoid any big celebrations or demonstrations of support for Russia that could spark violence. Odessa and Kharkiv canceled all big public events, while Luhansk asked groups to avoid gathering in the city. The city of Donetsk, however, was pushing ahead with events. Referendum postponement call . Less than two months after Crimea was wrested from Ukraine's grasp, there are fears that other parts of the country could go the same way. Pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine said Thursday that they had decided to go ahead with a Sunday referendum on greater local powers, defying a call by Putin to postpone the vote. Putin had urged the pro-Russian sympathizers to delay the referendum to give dialogue ""the conditions it needs to have a chance."" But representatives from the council of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic and separatists from Luhansk told reporters they had voted to press ahead with the vote. The West has strongly opposed the move. In a statement Friday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius condemned the pro-Russian separatists for holding ""illegal referendums."" Fabius, who spoke by phone with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, also reiterated France's determination to find a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine. The immediate priority is to de-escalate the situation, engage in a national dialogue and prepare for the May 25 elections, Fabius said. ""On the local 'referenda,' we strongly emphasize that they should not take place -- neither on 11 May nor at any later date,"" said Maja Kocijancic, spokeswoman for the European Union's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton. ""Such unauthorized local 'referenda' have no democratic legitimacy and can only lead to further escalation."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone with both Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Yatsenyuk on Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.","Health officials say at least seven people killed and 39 more injured in clashes in Mariupol .

"Feeling buried by work, like you can't find time for a few days off, like your entire work-life balance is out of whack? If you're an American worker, it just might be. A new study has found that U.S. workers forfeited $52.4 billion in time-off benefits in 2013 and took less vacation time than at any point in the past four decades. American workers turned their backs on a total of 169 million days of paid time off, in effect ""providing free labor for their employers, at an average of $504 per employee,"" according to the study. Titled ""All Work and No Pay: The Impact of Forfeited Time Off,"" the study was conducted by Oxford Economics for the U.S. Travel Association's Travel Effect Initiative, which studies the impact of forgone vacation time. ""Americans are work martyrs,"" says the U.S. Travel Association. ""Tied to the office, they leave more and more paid time off unused each year, forfeiting their earned benefits and, in essence, work for free."" According to the study, in 2013 U.S. employees took an average of 16 days of vacation, compared with an average of 20.3 days as recently as 2000. ""The economic potential of returning to the pre-2000 vacation patterns is massive: annual vacation days taken by U.S. employees would jump 27% (or 768 million days), delivering a $284 billion impact across the entire U.S. economy,"" according to the travel association. Based in Washington, the association is a national nonprofit organization representing all components of the travel industry. Does this describe you? Productivity and stress management trainer and coach Joe Robinson says the issue is driven by a number of factors. ""One, workers are afraid to take their vacations in the layoff era,"" Robinson said. ""It might mark them as less 'committed' than coworkers. ""It's called defensive overworking. They work long hours and skip vacations to insulate themselves from cutbacks."" According to Roger Dow, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, 28% of workers surveyed said they've declined to take earned days off in order to illustrate their dedication to the job. ""They say, 'I don't want to be seen as a slacker,' "" Dow said. "" 'I want to be seen as someone who is really dedicated.' ""But it does them no good whatsoever. People who take more time off tend to get more raises and promotions."" ""It's futile,"" Robinson agreed. ""People who don't take their vacations get laid off just like everyone else."" Work force cutbacks and ""device addiction"" are other factors. ""Lean staffing, with more and more people doing the jobs of several people, makes it hard to escape,"" Robinson said. ""They're not taking vacations because they have too much work."" ""About 40% (of workers surveyed) say they're afraid of all the work they're going to get to when they get back from vacation,"" Dow said. ""Work pileup scares the hell out of them."" ""Another big reason people aren't taking their time is that they are caught up in 'busyness' and device addiction,"" Robinson said. ""Finally, many people are so caught up in the performance identity, worth based on what they get done, they feel guilty when they step back."" Reversing the trend? A number of studies show that fewer vacation days can, perhaps counterintuitively, lead to decreased productivity. Researcher Mark Rosekind of Alertness Solutions has found that the respite effect of a vacation can increase performance by 80%. Reaction times of returning vacationers increased 40% in his study. According to Dow, some U.S. companies, particularly on the West Coast, are beginning to overhaul their vacation policies. ""We're seeing multiple companies -- Expedia and Netflix and others -- that are doing away with their vacation policies entirely,"" Dow said. ""They've just said, 'We no longer have a vacation policy; please discuss with your boss and take the time off you need.' "" In addition, companies that have instituted ""use it or lose it"" policies -- which don't allow annual vacation time to be rolled over to the next year or accrued for later use -- find that more employees take all of their earned leave. Dow reports that some companies and organizations, including the U.S. Travel Association, have begun giving bonuses to employees who use their entire allotment of paid leave. Perhaps these companies have become convinced by a growing body of research supporting the long-term bottom-line benefits of time away from work. Author of the books ""Work to Live"" and ""Don't Miss Your Life,"" Robinson is also the author of a current Entrepreneur magazine story titled ""The Secret to Increased Productivity: Taking Time Off,"" in which he states that ""working without letup is a bad habit that can jeopardize business, health and the life you're supposedly working toward.""

"A Missouri man pleaded guilty Thursday to a second-degree misdemeanor charge of endangering the welfare of a child in connection with a highly publicized sex assault case involving a teenage girl, a prosecutor said. Matthew Barnett, 19,  was sentenced to two years' probation. Prosecutors said Barnett, then 17, gave alcohol to his victim, Daisy Coleman, until she was impaired, and left her outside her home in temperatures below freezing during the early morning hours of January 8, 2012. Barnett had been arrested and charged with sexual assault, but two months after the incident the charges were dropped when the original prosecutor said the Coleman family wasn't cooperating with the investigation. The girl's mother denied that contention in an interview with CNN. Jean Peters Baker was appointed special prosecutor in October and reopened the case. Coleman, who was 14 when she claimed she was raped, released a statement through Baker's office. ""Today, I am grateful that the defendant took responsibility by pleading guilty to the charges. I am ready to move forward,"" Coleman, 16, said. Her mother said Baker did the best she could under tough circumstances, alluding to her belief that evidence had been altered, destroyed or lost. Barnett's attorney, Jay R. Hobbs, said the misdemeanor charge ""accurately reflects the conduct of which he should be held accountable for."" Baker said there wasn't enough evidence to file a felony sex assault or endangerment charge. ""This is the outcome that we believe was the right and just outcome in this case,"" she told reporters. Coleman was in a hospital after a weekend suicide attempt, her mother told CNN on Tuesday. Melinda Coleman said her daughter had been harassed by several people through social media. Melinda Coleman was not in court Thursday, telling CNN that she wanted to stay with her daughter. CNN does not typically identify alleged victims of sexual assault but has done so in this case because Daisy and her mother had chosen to go public. The most important term of Thursday's plea deal, Baker said, was the condition that Barnett apologize to Coleman. The prosecutor said she believed the verbal apology was genuine and heartfelt. She will relay the statement to Daisy at a later date, she said. Barnett also will have to pay the Colemans $1,800, take drug tests and do community service. He is not allowed to be around alcohol. If he violates his probation, he will go to jail for 120 days. The case gained national attention last year when on the one-year anniversary of the incident the Kansas City Star featured the story. According to a Missouri State Highway Patrol probable cause statement filed by prosecutors, Daisy Coleman and a friend were drinking at the Coleman home in Maryville, which is in northwest Missouri, about 100 miles north of Kansas City. Coleman and Barnett were texting each other and after midnight, Coleman and her friend sneaked out to meet Barnett, who drove them to his neighborhood. The patrol statement didn't identify Coleman's friend, but Paige Parkhurst, 13 at the time, later came forward to the media. After they sneaked into Barnett's parents home, they drank in the basement, along with several other people. Coleman told investigators she started drinking vodka, then doesn't remember anything else until she woke up in her yard around 5 a.m. She was barefoot, dressed only in a T-shirt and yoga pants. Barnett said that, after about an hour of drinking, he drove Coleman, Parkhurst and a boy to another friend's house, where Barnett asked the friend to drive them to Coleman's house to drop her off, according to the statement. Barnett and a juvenile carried Coleman to one side of her home then came back to the car, the document says. Weather records indicated temperatures were in the low 20s that morning. The probable cause statement was filed by prosecutors as part of the plea deal. It focuses on the alleged endangerment and makes no mention of a sexual assault allegation. In a statement issued in October, a lawyer for the Barnett family noted that a felony charge of sexual assault was filed January 9, 2012, against Matthew Barnett, alleging sexual intercourse with someone who was incapacitated. ""Mr. Barnett cooperated with the investigation and freely admitted to the sexual encounter,"" said the statement from lawyer Robert Sundell. ""While many find Matt Barnett's behavior reprehensible, the legal issue was whether a crime was committed. ""Subsequent investigation and interviews raised substantial doubt about the felony charge, specifically including whether the young lady was incapacitated during the encounter."" Melinda Coleman has said she thought the charges against Barnett had been dropped because of his family's political connections -- one of his grandfathers was a popular four-term state representative. Parkhurst said she was raped by a different boy that same night. That case was settled in juvenile court. Melinda Coleman said in 2013 that her children had received threats and she was fired from her job as a veterinarian at a clinic. The Colemans have since moved to another town. The case gained traction after the newspaper article and the Colemans' appearances on CNN. The online activist collective Anonymous picked up the cause, releasing a statement that questioned how the case was being handled.

"Hong Kong (CNN)Detentions, the kidnapping of bishops, tearing down churches -- these are the actions against Christians China has been guilty of. Even the pope has not been welcome in Chinese airspace in the last few decades. So when Pope Francis was given permission to fly over China on Thursday on his way to South Korea, many saw it as a sign of hope for religious freedom -- especially Catholicism -- in China. The state-run Global Times calls it a sign of ""possible détente."" But even as the central government and the pontiff seem to be getting along better, reports have emerged that Chinese Catholics have been barred from visiting South Korea to see the pontiff. Around half of more than 100 students who had planned to travel from China to South Korea to attend the Asian Youth Day event and catch a glimpse of the Pope have not made it. Heo Young-yeop, spokesman for the Committee for the Papal Visit to Korea, told the media that it was due to ""a complicated situation inside China."" This apparent U-turn in attitude towards the papacy, within a matter of days, has Vatican-watchers confused, hinting at an increasingly opaque Chinese government that is struggling to manage its religious groups. ""There's a pattern of pendular movement in the Chinese government's stance towards religion, of being repressive and then of being accommodating,"" says Lionel Jensen, Associate Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures, at the University of Notre Dame. ""I don't believe that the Vatican and the Communist Party will come to any agreement in the manner that some might hope,"" he said, adding that he has heard from a source, which he does not wish to name for security reasons, that the students who did not make it to the event in Korea are currently unaccounted for. CNN is not able to independently confirm this. Woes of worship . The Vatican and Beijing have had no formal relations since the Communist Party came into power in 1949. Officially an atheist country, China does not recognize the authority of the Vatican over its millions of Catholics. Instead, it has set up its own Catholic governing body, known as the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association that answers to the Party. This association is similar to other state organizations that manage followers of major faiths, including the Three-Self Patriotic Movement for Protestants and the Chinese Patriotic Islamic Association. But there are other religious groups in China that have not been sanctioned by the state and that worship underground. Jin Tianming is a priest and member of Beijing Shouwang Church, an underground Protestant community. His group of worshipers has had trouble finding a permanent location to hold church gatherings, frequently suffering harassment from police, with members of the church arrested or detained on occasion. ""We put our beliefs above society. I don't think the two are compatible in any way,"" says Jin. Religious bloom . The existence of unregistered religious groups makes it difficult to calculate the number of Christians in China. A Pew Research Center study from 2011 estimates the number of Christians inside China at 67 million, about 5% of the country's total population at the time, amongst which around 10 million are Catholics. This is compared to 10 million Christians in total in 1996. According to researchers, the numbers are rising quickly. Professor Fenggang Yang, director of the Center on Religion and Chinese Society at Purdue University, has predicted that China will be home to the largest Christian population by 2030. The rapidly growing popularity of religion may be seen as a threat to the Communist Party's authority. ""The matter of religion in China -- especially the issue of Islam and Christianity, including Catholicism and Protestantism -- these are the fault lines in the future development of the country,"" says Jensen. ""I think that the Chinese government doesn't know how to go about assessing the strain along those lines."" In the past few months, crucifixes, and even entire churches, have been torn down in China under the premise of building code violations. The Christian community has reacted in large numbers, with thousands showing up to protest the demolitions. Sino-Christianity . In the latest move by the central authorities to control the spread of Christianity, the governing body for religious affairs has said that it will develop ""Chinese Christian theology."" ""The construction of Chinese Christian theology should adapt to China's national condition and integrate with Chinese culture,"" said Wang Zuoan, director of the State Administration for Religious Affairs. The announcement was made at a seminar on the Sinicization of Christianity in Shanghai last week. An official five-year campaign has been ongoing since 2013 to promote ""positive and correct theological thinking"" and provide guidance to official registered church groups. Just how will a Chinese-style Christian theology look like? ""It will attempt to tie together values of socialist culture and the practice of faith. The criteria will probably be vague, they will leave it open so authorities can determine who is violating the rules or not,"" says Jensen. He predicts that it will likely echo what one hears within the larger context of the Chinese education system in general, stressing social harmony and social stability. He points out that a Chinese theology is ""startling"" because it suggests that the long standing framework of constraints of religious practice may not be working out anymore. ""It is an effort to gain an upper hand within the wilderness of immense Christian expansion.""

Now, days later, as investigators continue to search through what the Worcester County District Attorney's Office describes as the home's ""deplorable conditions (such as) massive insect infestation, mounds of used diapers and feces,"" a picture is beginning to emerge of the family that lived inside. And it's a picture so deranged, so unfathomable to a reasonable mind, that even a lawyer for the accused calls the situation ""completely inexplicable."" Erika Murray was arraigned September 12 on a bevy of charges stemming from the discovery of the dead infants at her home the day before, but she has not been charged in their deaths. The 31-year-old pleaded not guilty to charges of concealing an out of wedlock fetal death, two counts of permitting substantial injury to a child, intimidation of a witness, cruelty to an animal and violating an abuse prevention order, according to Tim Connolly, a district attorney spokesman. Whether or not Murray is the mother is not known by authorities for certain at this point, but her attorney assumes that she is. ""My expectation is that it will be confirmed that they were indeed hers,"" Keith Halpern told CNN. Murray lived in the now-condemned single family home with her longtime boyfriend, Ray Rivera, and the couple's children. Just how many children lived with them in the vermin-infested 1,150-square-foot home, however, depends on which parent you ask: of the four living children that the state removed from the home on August 28, Murray told investigators that Rivera, 38, only knew about two of them. The other two -- a 3 year old and an infant, according to Halpern -- were apparently not only born in secret but lived hidden from their father amid mountains of garbage under the same roof. Rivera also ""presumably"" did not know about the ones that had died, at least according to the account Murray has told authorities, Halpern said. ""It is a mystery to me how Mr. Rivera could have failed to notice (the) numerous pregnancies (of) the woman with whom he shared a bed,"" said Halpern. ""It's a mystery to me how he could have failed to realize that there were two children living under the same roof as him, and he didn't know about it."" CNN was unable to reach Rivera or members of his family Sunday evening. He has not been charged with any crime, and there is no public record of physical abuse. 'Prisoner of her own fear' Halpern said that while his client's explanation ""is not based in reality,"" the situation  Murray came to be in was the result of fear, not malice. ""She was terrified of the pregnancies being discovered,"" said Halpern. ""She was terrified of the two younger children being discovered. Why? I don't know the answer to that."" Whether based in reality or not, Halpern said Murray was ""a prisoner of her own fear"" and suggested it was that fear that explains the three infants found dead in her home. ""Try to imagine the state of mind of a woman who attempts to hide a pregnancy,  go into labor and deliver children -- at least twice, but presumably five times -- on her own."" ""I feel certain that she did not do anything to harm any of these children,"" he said. ""I don't think there will be a determination that they were killed."" Though Halpern said he has yet to consult with a pathologist, he said it is not clear if they were ever alive to begin with or if they were all stillborn. Abuse suspected in 2007 . The state's removal of the four living children at the home last month was the result of the filing of what's called a 51A report in Massachusetts, according to Alec Loftus, a spokesman for the state's office of Health and Human Services. A 51A can be filed by any citizen with reason to believe that a child has been abused or neglected. This was not the first time a 51A had been filed when it came to that home, according to a Massachusetts Department of Children and Families spokeswoman. Cayenne Isaksen said such a report was previously received in 2007, but that ""it was unsupported and therefore no case was opened."" For now, Isaksen said DCF has Murray's four children in its care and is focused on  ""ensuring (their) safety and well-being and providing them with the proper medical care, support and services they need,"" she said. Connolly said that the family caring for them has no public statement to make at this time. Murray's case was adjourned to October 14. Investigators, meanwhile, remain at the scene digging through the squalor. ""Our investigation will continue for quite some time,"" said Joseph Early, the Worcester County District Attorney.

"(CNN)Thirty years ago Wednesday, more than three dozen stars -- many fresh from the American Music Awards -- checked their egos at the door and piled into a recording studio to record ""We Are the World."" The basic tracks for the Lionel Richie-Michael Jackson composition had been done a week earlier, but it was this January 28, 1985, session that counted -- the one that included Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Billy Joel and many other of the biggest artists of the day (and, in many cases, of all time). ""We Are the World"" was a way to raise money to fight a famine in Ethiopia and other parts of Africa, following in the harmonious path blazed by Band Aid's ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" The single, credited to USA for Africa, sold more than 20 million copies and topped the charts for four weeks in April and May. It was a big deal at the time. Even ""Doonesbury's"" Garry Trudeau got involved. In the decades that have followed, there have been other attempts at all-star charity records and performances, some hugely successful, others all but ignored. (Quincy Jones helmed both the original 1985 record and its remake, a 2010 fund-raiser for Haiti, which wasn't as big a hit.) The original song -- and video -- have been widely parodied. And we won't even mention ""Hands Across America."" (Whoops.) It was a long time ago, wasn't it?

"Six weeks before winning the 1998 Miss World crown, 18-year-old Linor Abargil was raped at knife-point by a travel agent escorting her home to Israel from a modeling gig in Italy. Her mother encouraged her to report the attack and go on to compete in the pageant on behalf of Israel. Just as her mother supported her, Abargil is now trying to empower other victims of sexual assault to speak up. Abargil's journey from beauty queen to activist is chronicled in the Emmy-nominated documentary, ""Brave Miss World."" ""It was her mom's reaction telling her, 'Don't worry, it wasn't your fault, go to police, don't take a shower,' that changed her life. It gave her the courage to report the crime,"" said Cecilia Peck, who produced the film with Inbal Lessner, Motty Reif and Lati Grobman. After her rapist was convicted in 1999, Abargil stopped speaking publicly about the attack and retreated from the public eye. In 2008, she re-emerged, encouraging victims of sexual violence to share their stories -- and invited the filmmakers to follow her journey. ""Brave Miss World"" follows Abargil from South Africa to Europe, where she speaks with rape survivors, to rallies on American college campuses and the halls of Israeli Parliament, all the way to the scene of her attack in Italy. Along the way she works through family relationships, embraces Orthodox Judaism and deals with her own trauma. ""The film is really about the courage it takes to fight for justice and speak up for rape and assault. It's about the making of an activist,"" Peck said. Killer's rants inspire #YesAllWomen conversation . Nominated for a 2014 Emmy for Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking, the film goes beyond the screen to empower victims of sexual violence to speak up through its website, in community screenings and on social media. CNN spoke with Peck and Lessner in May about what it took to complete the film and how it continues to have an impact. The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity: . CNN: Why did you decide to release this movie now? Cecilia Peck: It's hard to craft a narrative out of a taboo subject. We've been working on the film for five years. It just happened to (debut) at a time that coincides with what feels like national attention being turned to this issue. Our timing came from Linor being ready to speak out about the rape after a long period of healing. It took her 11 years after her assault -- and winning the crown, and spending years in court, and retreating -- to heal. Inbal Lessner: It was important for Linor to inject real meaning to the crown. She felt the title was meaningless unless she did something with it. She knew it gave her a platform that people would listen to, it would amplify the message. She had already made a difference in her country after speaking publicly in the rape trial. She told women in Israel, ""If I could do it, you can do it, too. Report, don't stay silent,"" and the number of reports of rape to police and crisis centers rose dramatically and [authorities] attributed it to her, along with new legislation inspired by case. She was hoping to reach a broader audience on a global scale by doing outreach and activism, and a documentary would help her reach that audience. CNN: Why do you think she was ready? Peck: Ever since her rape, women been have been writing to her from all over saying you gave me courage to tell somebody. With a film she hoped to reach more people than she could in person. With the website she wanted to give survivors a place to connect. By filming her story the message could go much broader. Lessner: She felt ready to take this on with the 10-year anniversary of (winning) the crown. Everything came together in 2008. She felt very strong and ready to take this on, and neither of us had any idea that it would turn out the way it did, that it would be so difficult, that it would be re-traumatizing. CNN: Tell me more about those difficulties. How did she experience trauma all over again? Peck : It started when she found out (her rapist) was getting furloughs from prison. She shut down filming. She realized she wasn't as strong as she thought, that it wasn't completely behind her, and it can trigger symptoms of PTSD. She began fighting to keep him in prison for the duration of his sentence, not to release him early. As well as telling her stories over and over again, and hearing stories all over the world about how pervasive (rape) is, that things haven't come so far, it's still difficult to access justice, all those things made the journey much harder than we thought. And, we did have to stop at a point for six months, and we didn't know if the film would get finished. CNN: How does the film relate to the current cultural discussion of ""rape culture"" and efforts to reform school policies around reporting sexual misconduct? Peck: The central part of story is about college campuses and talking about how life is adversely affected by rape and sexual assault. With her story, the website and the work (of student activists), it feels like we're all working toward the same goal to make things safer on college campuses. CNN: What do people share? Is there a common theme? Peck: We hear more about the need for better and extensive training for administrations to respond to rape.  We keep hearing there isn't adequate training, and (survivors) don't always have access to Title IX coordinators; there's nowhere to go where they feel safe about reporting or talking about assault and rape. Student activists really are making a difference. I think they're putting pressure on schools to make schools safer. CNN: How do you measure the film's success? Lessner: On our microscopic level we're trying to quantify outreach and success by how many people are speaking up at our screenings or on the website. We've seen an increase in the number of stories and people sharing on our page or engaging in discussion on Twitter using #IAmBrave. Peck: We felt a real responsibility to make a film that would resonate with audiences around the world and amplify Linor's message of how important it is to not be ashamed and not to stay silent. When you're responsible for a message like that it's deeply engaging; it's a crusade. It's hard to raise money and stay with it for so long. But you feel in the end that you have done something that could make a difference in this world.","""Brave Miss World"" received an Emmy nomination .

"At least 30,000 children in Mexico are involved in some sort of organized crime, according to a nationwide alliance of civic and social organizations. The Child Rights Network in Mexico says many of these children are taking part because of death threats or because of economic and social necessity. It is urging the government to start recognizing them as victims of child abuse. ""The drug cartels are not training them to be ringleaders,"" spokeswoman Veronica Morales said. ""It is a new form of abuse in which they are being used to commit an offense, to violate the law and to deceive authorities."" In the past year, there have been numerous headlines of children being arrested in Mexico. Perhaps the most high-profile case involved a 14-year-old boy known as ""El Ponchis"" (""The Cloak""). He was found guilty of torturing and beheading at least four people for the South Pacific drug cartel. A month after the boy was sentenced to three years in a correctional facility, a 13-year-old girl was captured in the state of Jalisco and accused of being part of the Zetas drug cartel. Authorities said the girl was receiving 8,000 pesos a month -- almost $800 -- for being a lookout. She would let gang members know who was entering and who was leaving Luis Moya, a municipality in north-central Mexico. In January of last year, a 15-year-old boy was captured in Jiutepec, just outside of Mexico City. During an impromptu news conference on the street, the child confessed that he was a lookout for the South Pacific cartel. He said he was collaborating with the cartel because of death threats. Children are easy prey for organized crime because they lack opportunities, said José Luis Cisneros, a sociologist at the Metropolitan Autonomous University in Mexico City. ""Socially, (the children) see the violence as the only way to make people respect them -- and as a way to exercise certain power, something that has been denied to their families,"" Cisneros said. While the Child Rights Network in Mexico said it has documented at least 30,000 kids involved in some criminal group, the Mexican government said it has not. According to the Agence Presse-France, the government told the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child that it doesn't have information about minors involved in criminal or armed groups. A legal gap for children? Civil organizations in Mexico also said law enforcement officials are violating children's rights when they make arrests. The Child Rights Network in Mexico said it is common for many child suspects  -- like the 14-year-old assassin and the 15-year-old boy in Jiutepec -- to be presented to the media without respect for their privacy or their presumption of innocence. ""A youth criminal justice law does not exist,"" Morales said. ""There is a proposal in review in the Congress, but even that one has significant omissions. ""The (United Nations) Convention (on the Rights of the Child) points out that the children have to be treated and not necessarily imprisoned after having committed a crime."" Arturo Argente, director of the law faculty at the Monterrey Institute of Technology of Higher Education (Toluca Campus), agrees that Mexican authorities must protect a child's identity and guarantee that a process will follow ""from a child-abuse angle, as a kid who has been working at an illegal business."" In addition to that, he said, the children must receive psychological treatment and be taught to respect the law. Morales is calling for a comprehensive law that would ""give attention to the kids"" with specialized courts, judges, lawyers and specialists. ""When there is a child involved in some organized crime act, there is never a suitable investigation,"" she said. ""The authorities justify that it is a drug-trafficking crime and it is treated as a regular case."" Experts note that arrested children are not the only young people affected by organized crime. In the past five years, from December 2006 to December 2011, at least 1,188 children have died because of armed clashes, according to the Child Rights Network in Mexico. That represents about 2.5% of the estimated 47,515 drug-related deaths over the last five years reported by Mexican authorities. The U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child confirmed that up until 2010, 1,000 children had died in acts linked to organized crime.","The past year has seen numerous headlines of children being arrested in Mexico .

"The front page of the website for Krabloonik, a dog sled operation near Aspen, Colorado, shows healthy, happy-looking dogs pulling a sled through snow. A white dog seems almost to smile -- mouth gaping open -- as the team turns a tight corner. Contrast that image with those recently released by state authorities, who inspected the business in December after reports of potential abuse. Those photographs show sled dogs in chains. Some appear painfully thin, with visible ribs, while others display signs of infection. Which of the images speak the truth? The answer may well be decided in court. Questioning motives . The owner and operator of Krabloonik, Dan MacEachen, faces eight counts of animal cruelty. He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday. A call to his attorney, Greg Greer, was not immediately returned Monday, but at least a part of his client's story is contained within court documents. The case was brought to the attention of authorities by three former Krabloonik employees: Guy Courtney, Curtis Hungate and Christian Lowry. Two of them had a bone to pick with MacEachen, documents filed by Greer allege. Hungate is the father of a child involved in a custody case, who is also the grandson of MacEachen. ""Mr. Hungate had attempted to extort a settlement in the child custody issue by threatening to make public claims about Mr. MacEachen's dog sled operation,"" the documents read. Courtney, meanwhile, had been attempting to buy the business and engaged in a conspiracy to undermine MacEachen's position at Krabloonik, they allege. According to CNN affiliate KUSA, Courtney was Krabloonik's general manager. He dismissed as ""absurd"" the idea that he is trying to build a smear campaign against MacEachen. ""I wanted to buy Krabloonik for the benefit of the dogs,"" Courtney reportedly said. ""It's always been about the dogs."" Dogs as commodities? Authorities impounded eight dogs from Krabloonik, in Snowmass Village, Colorado, on December 12. Six were severely malnourished, and two required serious veterinarian care, they said. Krabloonik has some 250 dogs, according to KUSA, which visited the business and found that -- overall -- the dogs that the station were shown seemed healthy. MacEachen told KUSA the dogs are athletes and must maintain a certain weight. He said he's not angry at his critics. ""Perhaps they don't have the education to understand what is really going on here,"" MacEachen told the affiliate. Among his biggest critics is a group called Voices for the Krabloonik Dogs. It has a Facebook page with more than 2,000 likes. A member of that group, Leigh Vogel, sent an iReport, detailing the alleged abuse and tipping CNN off to the story. The iReport has received more than 16,000 views. ""Animals, especially in a resort town known for its high standards of care for people and animals, are not commodities,"" said Vogel. ""What is personal to me is the injustice these dogs have to live through in order to bring in cash for the owner and the town of Snowmass Village.""","Dan MacEachen faces eight counts of animal cruelty .

"(CNN) -- Imagine if a streetlamp knew you were coming. It could announce your arrival from a distance. If you were on a date, it could help set the mood. It could ring in the new year with dazzling effects, change color at will, even announce days in advance when its bulb was set to blow. In fact, there is nothing future-tense about this fantastical vision; in a handful of municipalities in Europe, streetlights have become downright chatty. The system is called Tvilight. It was invented by Dutch designer Chintan Shah while a student at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. When flying overseas, he noticed streetlamps lighting streets that, in the middle of the night, were empty and desolate. ""I started researching,"" he says. ""I wondered, why are they burning? How much does it cost? Is this a problem? I discovered some amazing numbers."" Read more: 12 amazing designs from the past 100 years . Shah found that Europe pays over â‚¬10 billion ($13 billion) a year powering streetlights, which accounts for more than 40% of government energy bills. This translates into 40 million tons of CO2 emissions annually -- enough to power 20 million cars. His solution was to create an intelligent, ""on-demand"" lighting system using wireless sensors. Streetlights only light up in the presence of a person, bicycle or car, and remain dim the rest of the time. Shah has also developed the technology to distinguish between people and smaller animals, like cats and mice, so it would avoid lighting up unnecessarily. ""I thought, why should each citizen pay for street lights that aren't being used? We now have a solution for that."" Spurred on by his professors, Shah entered the concept in a campus competition and won. Delft handed over their facilities and gave him the financial backing to create a demonstration on campus. Since then, Tvilight has been implemented in four municipalities in Holland and one in Ireland, with many more to come. ""We have enquiries from Israel, Turkey, the United States, Australia, India and Japan. The problem is not a lack of enquiries, it's the team's capacity to deliver the solution worldwide,"" he says. Read more: Technology of tomorrow . Shaw reckons the system will slash energy costs and CO2 emissions by 80%, and maintenance by another 50%, thanks to the integrated wireless sensor that allows lamps to alert a central control center when it's time to be serviced. Tvilight's primary purpose is to conserve energy. But when CNN invited Dutch artist Daan Roosegaarde to offer advice as a mentor for Shah, he pointed to the technology's more artistic potential. ""How can we use the technology to make environments more human? More sustainable? More natural?"" asks Roosegaarde. ""We want to make it like it's your friend, or it's an animal, or it does things you don't know about. It's not just a machine with a feedback loop, but something that has its own intelligence and is willing to negotiate, to hack you in the same way you hack it."" So, for example, an ambulance or fire truck could communicate with the lamps to make them flicker red before they drive through. Read more: The bright world of electric paint . ""It could save the ambulance two minutes because the light could tell everyone it's coming, and they could move aside more quickly because we control the streets, we control the lamps,"" says Shah. ""It could save a life."" Roosegaarde suggests the uses could be ""pragmatic or super poetic."" ""Imagine I can write a piece of software, so when I take my girlfriend out for a walk, it does something special, and wow, you have this boulevard of interactive lights,"" he adds. It is the type of thinking that garners endless scenarios. Depending on the occasion, streetlamps can flicker and change color to create any number of designs. Shah envisions that during a live sporting event, a street could even spell out the score. ""This is not just about saving electricity, it's not just about the medium, it's about the message, and what you want it to generate,"" says Roosegaarde.","Tvilight is a streetlamp system that brightens in the presence of people, cars and bicycles .
New system could slash energy bills by 80% in cities around the world .

"When Beyonce tells people to ""bow down,"" they listen. Now the star is hoping to bring the same show-stopping power to the issue of gender inequality with an essay on Maria Shriver's website, The Shriver Report. In ""The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Pushes Back from the Brink,"" the 32-year-old pop star -- writing under her full name, Beyonce Knowles-Carter -- proclaims that ""gender equality is a myth!"" The ""average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes. But unless women and men both say this is unacceptable, things will not change."" Humanity, she continues, ""requires both men and women, and we are equally important and need one another. ... We have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect, so that as they grow up, gender equality becomes a natural way of life. And we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible."" Her words are likely familiar to those who know her music, which references the trials of womanhood and female empowerment going all the way back to her work with Destiny's Child. That's not to imply that Beyonce's pop music message doesn't have its conflicts. In the 1999 Destiny's Child song, ""Bills, Bills, Bills,"" the lyrics scold a lover who's gone from footing the bill to asking for money. ""Silly me, why haven't I found another,"" the song continues. ""Can you pay my bills? ... If you did then maybe we could chill."" On the other hand, there are Destiny's Child anthems like ""Independent Women,"" Parts I and II, with lyrics such as ""I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings. ... Try to control me, boy you get dismissed,"" which became a nightclub rallying cry. Given her prominence and success, her statements on womanhood and feminism are often a source of public debate. Last April, Beyonce told British Vogue that she hesitated to call herself a feminist. (Katy Perry similarly ducked the designation while accepting 2012's Billboard Woman of the Year award, during which she said she's ""not a feminist,"" but does ""believe in the strength of women."") The word feminist ""can be very extreme,"" she told Vogue. ""But I guess I am a modern-day feminist. I do believe in equality. Why do you have to choose what type of woman you are? Why do you have to label yourself anything? I'm just a woman and I love being a woman."" A woman, for the record, who celebrates the power of women -- that much is clear from her two most recent albums alone. On her 2011 disc ""4"" there was the self-assured ""Who Run the World (Girls)?,"" in which she praises the power of women: ""My persuasion/can build a nation .... (We're) smart enough to make these millions/strong enough to bear the children/then get back to business."" And her chart-topping surprise 2013 release, the self-titled ""Beyonce,"" has been endlessly debated as a symbol of her feminist perspective -- or lack thereof. In the song ""***Flawless"" from that album Beyonce samples words from celebrated writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's April 2013 TED Talk ""We Should All Be Feminists."" ""Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage,"" Adichie says in the sample. ""Marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support, but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage, and we don't teach boys the same?"" In her piece for The Shriver Report, Beyonce echoes Adichie's perspective, saying ""these old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning. ... Men have to demand that their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters earn more -- commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender. Equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect."" The singer's contribution is one of many pieces that fill Shriver's report, which explores the rates of financial insecurity among American women, examines its impact, and offers solutions for change. Along with Beyonce, Shriver's report pulled in actress Eva Longoria, who wrote a piece entitled ""Empowering Latinas,"" and basketball star LeBron James, who penned an appreciation of the nation's working mothers. The report, which is in partnership with the Center for American Progress, can be downloaded for free here.","Beyonce addresses gender inequality in an essay on Maria Shriver's website .

"The Austin, Texas, police chief said he was trying to put a jaywalking arrest ""in context"" when he said police in other towns ""are actually committing sexual assaults on duty."" Now he's apologized for his choice of words. The controversy started Thursday when someone posted a video that showed jogger Amanda Jo Stephen, 24, in handcuffs and sitting on the sidewalk near the University of Texas campus. Moments later she's shown yelling and cursing at Austin police officers as they load her into a police car. When asked about the video Friday, Police Chief Art Acevedo said, ""Cops are actually committing sexual assaults on duty so I thank God that this is what passes for a controversy in Austin, Texas. ... And I'm glad that I'm here having to address mediocrity."" A day later, he was forced to backtrack. ""During the press conference I attempted to place the arrest into context by bringing attention to the fact that law enforcement deals with many acts of serious misconduct,"" he said in a statement Saturday. ""This includes recent instances in the news of sexual assault by police officers in other cities. In hindsight I believe the comparison was a poor analogy, and for this I apologize."" The arrest occurred as Austin police are trying to cut down on jaywalking. CNN affiliate KXAN reported that seven people were arrested Thursday near 24th and San Antonio streets, where Stephen was arrested. Acevedo said the woman was arrested for not giving police her name when asked, KXAN reported. Acevedo noted on Saturday that Austin police had been through an emotional week. On Friday, a man was convicted of killing Austin police officer Jaime Padron in 2012.","A video showing Austin police arresting a jaywalker was posted .

"Rebel and Syrian forces battled early Saturday for a building that houses state-run TV and radio studios in Aleppo, a day after the U.N. General Assembly approved a resolution that slams the Syrian government for its actions and the U.N. Security Council for its failure to counter the crisis. Elements of the Free Syrian Army took partial control of the Aleppo building, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria, but had to withdraw because of snipers and military shelling. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that TV service has been disrupted. Meanwhile, state-run television, based in Damascus, reported earlier that ""a group of mercenaries and terrorists attacked civilians and the television and radio building in Aleppo and our honorable armed forces are fighting them."" CNN cannot independently confirm reports of violence because the government restricts access by foreign journalists. The General Assembly adopted the Saudi-sponsored resolution 133-12 with 31 abstentions. It came a day after Kofi Annan announced his resignation as the U.N. and Arab League special envoy to Syria. He championed a six-point peace plan that has failed to take hold. The resolution notes ""human rights abuses by armed opposition groups"" and condemns ""all violence, irrespective of where it comes from, including terrorist acts."" But most of its ire is reserved for President Bashar al-Assad's regime. It strongly condemns ""the continued widespread and systematic gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the Syrian authorities and pro-governmental militias."" It cites ""the use of force against civilians, massacres, arbitrary executions, the killing and persecution of protesters, human rights defenders and journalists, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, interference with medical treatment, torture, sexual violence, and ill-treatment, including against children."" It also underscores its ""grave concern at the threat by the Syrian authorities to use chemical or biological weapons."" The resolution expresses ""deep concern at the lack of progress towards implementation of the six-point plan"" and deplores ""the failure of the Security Council to agree on measures to ensure the compliance of Syrian authorities with its decisions."" General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, unlike Security Council resolutions. But diplomats at the General Assembly strongly upbraided the Security Council, where Russia and China have vetoed tough resolutions against Syria. Russia, China, North Korea, Iran and Syria were among those voting against the resolution. Algeria, India and Pakistan were among those abstaining. Of Syria's neighbors, Lebanon abstained, and Iraq, Jordan and Turkey voted for the resolution. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice hailed the vote ""by an overwhelming majority of U.N. member states."" ""The General Assembly demanded once more that the first step in the cessation of violence be made by the Assad regime,"" she said. ""Importantly, the resolution also welcomes the Arab League's July 22 decision, which calls for Assad to step down and for a transitional government to be formed. The United States is pleased that the General Assembly has made it abundantly clear that Syria's chemical weapons must remain secure and that members of the regime will be held accountable in the event such weapons are used."" ""The conflict in Syria is a test of everything this organization stands for,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the assembly ahead of the vote. ""I do not want today's United Nations to fail that test."" Syria's U.N. ambassador, Bashar Jaafari, called the resolution a ""piece of theater"" that serves the interests of other countries in the region. He cited ""foreign interference"" and what he called the use of human shields by Syrian rebels. Frank Gaffney, founder of the Center for Security Policy, said the United Nations sometimes builds unreasonable expectations by ""creating the impression that somebody is going to do something about a problem. ... In the end, it almost never can do anything."" But U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said the body can be effective, such as when the Security Council united against former Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi and halted an offensive by his military. Violence intensified across Syria on Friday, and Ban made reference to the violence in Aleppo, the nation's most populous city. For days, it has been engulfed in fighting between regime forces and rebels. An all-out battle is predicted there. At least 120 people were reported dead in the country's violence on Friday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees said. The group said that at least 72 of the fatalities occurred in a government massacre in the Hama neighborhood of Arbaeen. As they have every Friday since the uprising began nearly 17 months ago, protesters marched across the country with a theme for the week. Deir Ezzor, the restive province in the east, was the focus of anti-government demonstrators this week: ""heroic Deir Ezzor, the coming victory from the east."" Regime shells have battered the area for weeks, and protesters wanted to show solidarity with the people there. At least seven people were killed in Deir Ezzor on Friday, the LCC said. ""Despite the big battle in Aleppo, we feel that Deir Ezzor is also leading the fight against the Assad regime and most of the cities and villages in the province have been liberated,"" said Mohammed Sarmini, a spokesman for the opposition Syrian National Council, the anti-al-Assad political movement based in Turkey. Sarmini said the opposition is working on setting up a secure central command. ""Our main mission is to form local neighborhood councils in order to avoid the cities slipping into chaos once the regime falls,"" Sarmini said. ""We had to wait until we had more liberated areas, and now we feel more confident after the latest developments in Aleppo."" Akil Hashem, a retired Syrian general who supports the opposition, said the rebel's capture of 40 to 60 tanks won't make a difference given that the regime still has about 4,000 tanks. Acquiring sophisticated anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons might, Hashem said. Syria has faced a diplomatic blowback over the crisis. A former Syrian Embassy employee speaking on condition of anonymity says the embassy in London is expected to close within two weeks. The former official cited difficulties dealing with British banks in the wake of international sanctions on Syria. ""When I left recently, the embassy had plenty of funds available to continue for some time, but the banks will no longer do business with the embassy."" British authorities, the official said, had been keen to keep the embassy open to maintain channels of diplomatic communication, but that communication now looks set to become much harder. According to the former official, two diplomats have quit the embassy this week. On Monday, the British Foreign office announced the resignation of Khaled al-Ayoubi, the most senior diplomat at the embassy, saying, ""he is no longer willing to represent a regime that has committed such violent and oppressive acts against its own people."" The second diplomat quit his post a few days later. The former official said al-Ayoubi, a career diplomat, asked British officials for a meeting about the embassy's finances and had gone to the Foreign Office in the middle of last week. In the following days, according to the former employee, he was ""nervous"" and had unusually given the staff Friday off work. The following Monday, he called in sick, and later that day, the British Foreign office announced his resignation. The former embassy official said most staff in the embassy don't believe the Foreign Office explanation because in recent weeks al-Ayoubi had actually been trying to dismiss staff members whom he suspected of supporting the opposition. The former official said that once al-Ayoubi realized that financial constraints would cause the embassy to close, he quit so he could remain in the UK rather than be sent back to war-torn Damascus with his family. CNN has been unable to contact al-Ayoubi. The Foreign Office said it would not comment on private meetings and had no information about the possible closure of the embassy. The Syrian conflict has claimed roughly 17,000 lives, Ban has said.","Fighting reported at radio-TV building in Syria's largest city .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law on Friday a measure that bans the adoption the Russian children by U.S. families effective January 1. The action could affect hundreds of U.S. families seeking to adopt. Americans adopted close to 1,000 Russian children last year, according to U.S. State Department figures. Read more: Russia's lower house approves bill to ban U.S. adoption . Though the number has been dropping in recent years, Russia remains the third-most-popular country -- after China and Ethiopia -- for U.S. citizens to adopt. The U.S. State Department said it ""deeply regrets"" the law announced by the Kremlin. ""The Russian government's politically motivated decision will reduce adoption possibilities for children who are now under institutional care,"" it said in a statement. ""We are further concerned about statements that adoptions already underway may be stopped and hope that the Russian government would allow those children who have already met and bonded with their future parent to finish the necessary legal procedures so that they can join their families."" The announcement was a wrenching one for Aaron and Jenny Moyer, coming in an adoption process that was well under way for them to become parents of a Russian orphan named Vitali. They carry photographs of them and Vitali together during their visits to Russia. ""He's our son,"" Aaron Moyer said. ""In our hearts, he is our son."" Jenny Moyer says she knows there is an orphan crisis in Russia, especially for children with special needs. Vitali has Down syndrome. The fact that he has the genetic condition associated with mental retardation may prove to be a help. A Russian parliamentarian, Robert Shlegel, was to submit an amendment that would allow U.S. citizens to adopt Russian children with disabilities, according to the state-run Itar-Tass news agency. The couple, who have two biological children and one adopted American child, said they are relying on their faith to see them through the uncertainty. ""We want not just our son, but all the kids over there to have families and to grow up and know the love of a mom and dad,"" Aaron Moyer said. iReporter says she's devastated by the news . The Russian measure also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the United States, if such activities could affect Russian interests, Russia's semiofficial RIA-Novosti news agency said. And it imposes sanctions against U.S. officials thought to have violated human rights. The law envisions the drafting of a list of U.S. citizens who will be prohibited from entering Russia, and will suspend the activity of any legal entities controlled by them in the country. Read more: Russian lawmakers eye adoption ban to U.S. The vote this week in the Federation Council, Russia's upper house, was unanimous, but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov criticized the bill ahead of its signing. Lawmakers in the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, adopted it last week. The move is widely seen as retaliation for a law that U.S. President Barack Obama signed on December 14. That bill, called the Magnitsky Act, imposes U.S. travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in Russia. The Magnitsky Act is named for Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state. Magnitsky died in 2009 after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. The Russian bill's implementation nullifies a recent agreement between the United States and Russia in which the countries agreed to additional safeguards to protect children and parties involved in inter-country adoptions. Backers of the Russian bill said American adoptive parents have been abusive, citing 19 deaths of adopted Russian children since the 1990s. The Russian public has supported the bill, with 56% of respondents in a poll conducted by the Public Opinion Foundation (FOM) saying they backed the ban, RIA Novosti reported. In 2010, an American woman sparked outrage after she sent her adopted son back to Russia alone on a one-way flight, saying the boy, then 7, had violent episodes that made her family fear for its safety. Konstantin Dolgov, the Russian Foreign Ministry's special representative for human rights, said Wednesday on Twitter that Russians were ""well aware of, and have pointed out more than once, the inadequate protection of adopted Russian children in the U.S."" He also said the United States is one of three nations that have not signed the 1989 U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. According to the U.N. Children's Fund, the United States is one of two nations -- the other being Somalia -- that has not ratified the convention. But the United States has signed the convention, thereby signaling its intent to ratify. Anthony Lake, executive director of UNICEF, touted the importance of ""inter-country adoption."" ""While welcoming Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev's call for the improvement of the child welfare system, UNICEF urges that the current plight of the many Russian children in institutions receives priority attention,"" he said. He asked that Russia let children's ""best interests"" guide the ""design and development of all efforts to protect children."" Groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch had urged Russian lawmakers to reject the bill. ""This bill hits back at Russia's most vulnerable children and could deprive them of the loving families they desperately need,"" Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said last week. John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia program director, has said that ""this bill is frankly a childish response to the Magnitsky Act.""","Russian lawmaker pushes for exception for children with disabilities .

"The first American man to win the Boston Marathon since 1983 crossed the finish line Monday, triumphant in a storied race that has become a national symbol of resiliency and determination. Meb Keflezighi, 38, won the men's division with an official time of 2:08:37, according to the Boston Marathon's Facebook page. The women's elite group began the 26.2-mile journey around 9:30 a.m. ET, and the elite men's group at 10. Waves of other runners started after them. For Kenya's Rita Jeptoo, 33, it was a second consecutive victory. She again won the women's division with an unofficial -- and course record -- time of 2:18:57, according to the event's official Twitter account. But for most of the 36,000 runners, the race had nothing to do with competition. The 2013 race was marred by bombings near the end of the course that killed three people and wounded more than 260. At the start Monday, as competitors stood shoulder to shoulder, the race announcer shouted to them, ""Take back that finish line!"" Lee Ann Yanni told CNN before the race that she planned to run wearing a necklace with a silver stingray charm that her father gave her before he died of cancer. The force of the blasts as she ran in 2013 along Boylston Street failed to tear the memento from her body. She would not be stopped then, and she wouldn't be stopped Monday, she vowed. Unable to walk for five and a half weeks, she eventually got back to training and finished the Chicago Marathon in October in 5 hours and 44 minutes. ""I'm running for those who can't,"" she told CNN. ""I don't run very pretty ... but at the finish line, everybody is going to be represented."" Krystle Campbell, 29; Lu Lingzi, 23; and grade-schooler Martin Richard, 8, were killed in the 2013 bombing. Some of the wounded lost limbs. J.P. Norden and his brother Paul recently recounted the confusion and horror of  April 15, 2013, with CNN at the Forum Restaurant on Boylston Street. ""Where we are right now where we got hurt, lost ... (it) changed our lives but, I don't know. ..."" J.P. said, struggling to find the words. Each brother had his right leg amputated, and they now walk on prosthetic legs. ""It was such a tough journey and stuff,"" J.P. said, ""but we got so much help from everyone that it's weird, it seems like so long away and ago and quick at the same time."" A year later, survivors are defiant and resilient . Another survivor, Marc Fucarile, also lost his right leg. He's undergone numerous surgeries, but shrapnel is still lodged in the inner wall of his heart. If it moves, he could die. Recently, the 35-year-old went to a court hearing for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev who allegedly, along with his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, were responsible for the bombing. Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police; Dzhokhar is facing numerous charges and could be sentenced to death. His trial is set to begin in November, and he has pleaded not guilty. ""Whatever he gets,"" Fucarile told CNN, ""he deserves."" Dzhokhar Tsarnaev awaits trial . On Tuesday, April 15, a moment of silence was observed at the finish line on the one-year anniversary of the bombings. Church bells rang and a flag was raised as a steady rain fell. The mantra ""Boston Strong"" was heard loud and clear. On race day, a tweet apparently from President Barack Obama appeared @WhiteHouse. ""Congrats to @runmeb and @ShalaneFlanagan for making America proud! All of today's runners showed the world the meaning of #BostonStrong. -bo."" Massachusetts native Shalane Flanagan was leading the pack of female runners for part of the race. According to the Boston Athletic Association's web site, she finished seventh among the women with a time of 2:22:02. This year's race has 9,000 more runners than last year's, and an unprecedented crowd was expected to gather, officials have said. CNN affiliate WBZ in Boston showed images on its website of the race as it unfolded. Security was expected to be very tight. Backpacks were not allowed on the course this year, said Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. Costumes that cover the face, containers with more than 1 liter of liquid and bulky clothes such as vests with pockets were also prohibited. The course this year would be ""very safe,"" Gov.

"(CNN) -- Michael Brown, Eric Garner and John Crawford all have one thing in common: It's not just that they were unarmed men of color killed by police officers -- it's that the responsibility to investigate each of their deaths fell to a medical examiner. We medical examiners investigate all homicides and violent deaths, and it is also part of our legal duty to investigate any death of a person under the control of, or in the custody of, a law enforcement agent. I have worked as a medical examiner for 13 years in four large cities in the United States. Medical examiner offices are independent public agencies, and one of our responsibilities is to act as quality control over law enforcement agencies. The medical examiner is the final arbiter of whether a death was the direct result of an arrest, or, instead, the result of natural disease or an incidental event. Medical examiner reports in most states are public records. We all deserve and should expect transparency in death investigation. The family of the deceased, the news media and anyone who asks for it can get a copy of the medical examiner's or coroner's autopsy report on any case that is not sealed as part of an active investigation. Medical examiners are physicians, specialists in forensic pathology. We are professionally protective of our independence. We know that it is our duty and responsibility, as the doctors who perform the autopsy, to speak for the dead. Unfortunately, in the wake of the death of a civilian at the hand of police officers, the public is often suspicious of the medical examiner. Because the law requires a local government agency to perform the death investigation, people often assume that this agency falls under the jurisdiction or influence of the police. News reports critical of the amount of time the dead body was left at the scene, or the amount of time it takes to get a final autopsy report, exacerbate this distrust. In St. Louis County, Missouri, where Michael Brown was autopsied, Dr. Mary Case, the chief medical examiner, is a board-certified forensic pathologist. She has years of experience and reports to the Health Department, not the police. Brown's official autopsy report was expedited and finalized on Monday. It was made available to the prosecuting attorney, who is now in charge of any release of information. Why does a death scene investigation take so long? An outdoor death scene is a messy and complicated place. As soon as the person has been declared dead, the area has to be frozen in time to ensure that we, the public, can later learn what really happened there. Crime scene photographers and trained evidence collection analysts have to ""process the scene,"" an hourslong procedure when done properly. The body, the position of any vehicles, the lighting, the height of adjacent structures --everything needs to be photographed from multiple angles. In a shooting, crime scene investigators will have to measure and document the number and location of the casings, bullets and strike marks. If the evidence and its undisturbed location are not documented in this painstaking way, then criminal or civil complaints against the officer may not stand up in court. But what about the autopsy report? Why does that take so long? That's because a competent job in the morgue, too, takes time. The work I do as a doctor in the autopsy suite after a typical gunshot wound homicide case may take three or four hours to complete, but after I leave the morgue, the report is not done. I have to wait for the report from the toxicology lab, which usually takes a minimum of two weeks, and for histology slides to come back before I can examine them under a microscope. Any of these findings could impact the cause of death. Even gunshot wounds cannot be interpreted in a vacuum. As part of an investigation I have to try to figure out which defects in the body come from bullets entering, and which from their exit. Usually these wounds are distinctly different in appearance, but the more complex the body position of the deceased, the more complicated things get. Exit wounds in flesh pressed against the ground or against tight clothing can appear just like entrance wounds. An entrance wound inflicted through an intermediary target that deformed the bullet can look just like an exit wound. Sometimes I have to wait for the police reports or witness transcripts in to correctly interpret what I see on the body in the autopsy suite. After the shooting in Ferguson, Michael Brown's family hired Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York State Police medical examiner, to conduct a second autopsy, and the federal Department of Justice instructed the Armed Forces Medical Examiner to conduct a third. What you can tell from a second or third autopsy is limited by autopsy artifact -- changes to the evidence caused by the performance of the first autopsy. In the course of the first, legally mandated autopsy, the forensic pathologist will have taken the organs out and sliced them apart for examination. The gunshot wounds will have been probed, and sometimes even cut into. More importantly, any pathologist hired by the family, regardless of expertise, does not have access to the crime scene and other evidence. Even Baden, in the report he prepared for the Brown family, concluded that without the clothing, evidence or scene information, he had ""too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting."" Why weren't the St. Louis medical examiner's autopsy findings made public immediately? Because releasing preliminary information when the investigation is still ongoing is premature and potentially inflammatory. Already the results of Baden's limited investigation are being used to support the contention that Brown was surrendering, and that the wounds were distant range, even though Baden himself said neither. To a forensic pathologist, the body diagram Brown's attorneys released tells a different story. The wound at the top of the head, the frontal wounds and angled right hand and arm wounds suggest that the victim was facing the officer, leaning forward with his right arm possibly extended in line with the gun's barrel, and not above his head. The image of a person standing upright with his hands in the air when he was shot does not appear compatible with the wounds documented on that diagram. Whether a forward-leaning position is a posture of attack or of surrender, however, is a matter of perspective. From the perspective of a witness, it could appear that the leaning person is complying with the officer and getting down. From the perspective of the officer, he may appear to be coming at him. Partial evidence yields partial answers, and a rush to conclusions based on one isolated set of data from a second autopsy only raises more questions. That is why it is so important to be patient and wait for all the scene information to come to light. But ""be patient and wait"" is not a demand that anyone has the right to make on a family that has lost a loved one in a sudden and violent event. When I have been assigned to investigate an in-custody or officer-involved death, I will often call the family right away. It's important to me to reach out to them, to tell the people who are awaiting answers from me that I am qualified to do the job I am trained for; that I will hide nothing from them; that everything I do on their behalf will be part of the public record; and to give them some idea of how long the process might take. When the report is finished, I meet with family members or their attorneys to discuss the findings and explain the medical diagnoses I have come to. This solemn conference takes place behind the scenes, months after the incident, and is never reported in the news media -- but it is probably the most important part of my job. As a doctor and a civil servant, I take my public role seriously. I strive to with all my ability, training and effort to answer any questions that person's family may have. I know that others in my field strive with the same effort. It's why we went into our field of medicine. We are servants of the public -- not of the state, not of any single law firm, and not of the police.

"(CNN) -- The debate over the controversial practice of child marriage in Saudi Arabia was pushed back into the spotlight this week, with the kingdom's top cleric saying that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed. ""It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger,"" Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in remarks quoted Wednesday in the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. ""A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong and they are being unfair to her."" The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom in recent weeks. Late last month, a Saudi judge refused to annul the marriage of an 8-year-old girl to a 47-year-old man. The judge, Sheikh Habib Abdallah al-Habib, rejected a petition from the girl's mother, whose lawyer said the marriage was arranged by her father to settle a debt with ""a close friend."" The judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty. Al-Sheikh was asked during a Monday lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry. ""We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls,"" he said, according to the newspaper. ""We should know that Shariah law has not brought injustice to women."" Christoph Wilcke, a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch, recently told CNN that his organization has heard many other cases of child marriages. ""We've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men,"" Wilcke said. Wilcke explained that while Saudi ministries may make decisions designed to protect children, ""It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts, and in many realms beyond the court."" Last month, Zuhair al-Harithi, a spokesman for the Saudi government-run Human Rights Commission, said his organization is fighting against child marriages. ""The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in Saudi Arabia,"" al-Harithi said. ""Child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed."" He added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place. Wajeha al-Huwaider, co-founder of the Society of Defending Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, told CNN last month that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to ""keep us backward and in the dark ages."" She said the marriages cause girls to ""lose their sense of security and safety. Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression."" The Saudi Ministry of Justice has made no public comment on the issue. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Grand mufti speaks out after judge refuses to annul marriage of man, 47, to girl, 8 .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN)  -- A Yemeni freighter has become the latest commercial vessel to be attacked in the pirate-plagued Gulf of Aden, a Kenyan maritime official said Tuesday. A French frigate shadows a commercial ship leaving Djibouti harbor on its way to the Gulf of Aden. The last contact with the ship was late last week, and it was unclear exactly when the hijacking took place, said Andrew Mwangura, the head of Kenya Seafarers Association. No further details about the ship, its crew or cargo were immediately available, said Mwangura, whose organization keeps tabs on the welfare of sailors captured by the pirates. Dozens of ships have been attacked in the Gulf of Aden by pirates based in largely lawless Somalia in recent months. This has led to calls from commercial ship owners for a military blockade along the coast of Somalia to intercept pirate vessels heading out to sea. Peter Swift, managing director of the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, said stronger naval action -- including aerial and aviation support -- is necessary to battle rampant piracy in the region.  Watch more about the growing piracy problem » . At present, warships from a number of countries patrol an international maritime corridor, escorting some merchant ships and responding to distress calls in the area. But the navies involved say it is virtually impossible to patrol the vast sea around the gulf. Meanwhile, a spokesman for pirates holding a Saudi supertanker loaded with crude oil has told the BBC they have not set any ransom figure. He said the group has only spoken to intermediaries of the vessel's owners but he described them as untrustworthy. The pirate identified himself using only one name, Daybad, when he spoke late Monday to the BBC. Pirates seized the Sirius Star on November 15 in their most audacious hijacking to date. The vessel is carrying two million barrels of crude oil worth about $100 million. Elsewhere, the head of U.S. military operations in Africa has said he does not have any evidence that Somali pirates are connected to al Qaeda. The Africom chief, Army Gen. William ""Kip"" Ward, told The Associated Press Tuesday that the chaos off Somalia's high seas is a reflection of the country's political chaos. Asked about alleged connections between pirates and al Qaeda, he said: ""I think that's a concern that we all would have."" But he added that he doesn't have ""any evidence that pirates have links to al Qaeda.""","Last contact with the Yemeni freighter was late last week .

"A defiant Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, was booked on Tuesday on two felony charges related to his handling of a local political controversy. Perry voluntarily appeared at the Travis County Court to be fingerprinted and to have his mug shot taken. ""I'm going to enter this courthouse with my head held high knowing that the actions I took were not only lawful and legal but right,"" Perry told reporters. ""I'm going to fight this injustice with every fiber of my being, and we will prevail and we'll prevail because we're standing for the rule of law,"" he said. The charges allege Perry misused his office by improperly threatening to and then withholding state funds for a program run by a county prosecutor unless she resigned. Perry, a Republican, was indicted last week on counts alleging coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity. His initial court appearance is scheduled for Friday. The case centers on Perry's veto in June 2013 of $7.5 million approved by the Legislature to fund a  public integrity unit run by Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat. He wanted her out, following a drunk-driving arrest. She refused to leave. Does Rick Perry's indictment disqualify him from 2016? His legal team insists he had a legal right to tie funding for the public integrity unit to Lehmberg's removal, and argues he had no legal obligation to explain his veto. Perry said on Tuesday that he would do the same thing again if faced with the same situation. Many Republicans and some Democrats have come to Perry's defense. Even Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, a Democrat, wasn't as strident in her reaction as her party's state committee, which called on Perry to step down. ""Those are very serious charges and I as a lawyer understand and trust the justice system and I will rely on it to do its job,"" she said on Monday. Perry is entering his final few months in office after a historic 14-year run in Austin, and it's unclear how the charges might impact any presidential run. It's an open secret he's laying groundwork for a second White House campaign after his disastrous 2012 effort and is due to visit key states in coming weeks.

"For those of you who do not have your calendars marked and gifts or cards purchased, a reminder: Sunday is Mother's Day, a ""holiday"" that many Americans have the luxury and good fortune to be able to observe. This year, the National Retail Federation estimates that Americans will spend around $18.6 billion on gifts for this one day -- even though most of us go through the motions of celebrating without having any idea about the day's original intent. Mother's Day can be traced back to Julia Ward Howe, and its aims were quite different from anything you'll find today on a greeting card. In her Mother's Day Proclamation of 1870, Howe called on her ""sisters"" to work to establish peace so that her son could return home from war: ""In the name of womanhood and humanity, I earnestly ask that a general congress of women without limit of nationality may be appointed and held ... to promote the alliance of the different nationalities, the amicable settlement of international questions, the great and general interests of peace."" This year, I would like to ask that we -- mothers and everyone else -- reignite the spirit of common purpose that Julia Ward Howe sought to inflame in Americans, and direct it toward a silent wartime that is taking hundreds of thousands of women's lives each year -- childbirth. The World Health Organization estimates that some 360,000 girls and women die worldwide each year from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications. Nearly all of these deaths are preventable. It's not that they are preventable if we find a cure, and it's not that they are preventable if we extend expensive lifelong treatment regiments. They are preventable if we extend very basic, known and trusted services: if we help women get to health care facilities in their time of need; if we ensure that a skilled professional is available to oversee their labor and delivery; if we provide access to family planning so that children are spaced. These goals are all within our reach, but only if we decide that women's lives are worth saving. What does the issue actually look like worldwide? Opinion: Global health within our grasp if we don't give up . While rates of maternal mortality are often highest in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, in several of those countries we are beginning to see declines. Startlingly, maternal mortality rates have been rising in America. According to the World Health Organization, the rate of women who died from pregnancy-related complications in the U.S. increased by nearly 50% from 1980 to 2008 -- a statistic that suggests this issue is one of equitable resources and education, not a lack of technology or infrastructure. Two years ago, I made a documentary film, ""No Woman, No Cry,"" and founded an advocacy and mobilization campaign called Every Mother Counts. I did both to raise awareness and support for maternal and child health care. We are trying to draw attention to an underreported global problem that can be solved if only we come together to make it a priority. Opinion: Mother's Day is not so rosy in Africa . Our organization measures success by the actions taken to reduce maternal mortality and improve maternal health. The goal is 5 million actions by 2015 -- perhaps signing a pledge, running a 5K or even a marathon or donating an old cell phone so it can be used to facilitate communication and medical care in rural areas. Our website, everymothercounts.org, suggests specific actions to take, many of them straightforward steps that help spread the word or raise resources for simple solutions. Individually they may seem small but together, they can save lives. With that said, here is what we propose for Mother's Day: a ""No Mothers Day."" Our ""proclamation"" encourages mothers to join in solidarity to ""disappear"" for the day, out of solidarity with those who needlessly die in pregnancy and childbirth. We believe that in acting together, we can show just how much a mother is missed when she is gone . We're spreading the word with a film to get families across the country talking about this issue, so that next year, there will be more mothers and families who can celebrate Mother's Day together. Please join me at http://www.facebook.com/everymothercounts, for No Mothers Day. Because together, our silence will speak the loudest for all mothers.","Christy Turlington Burns: Mother's Day first pushed bringing sons home from war .

"This month, the Supreme Court will deliver a hotly anticipated decision on whether for-profit companies should have to comply with the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive care rule. The companies that appeared before the court in March, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties, cited religious grounds in objecting to providing female employees birth control without a co-pay. But there's another issue in this case that, as a physician, I feel merits more attention: the importance and indeed revolutionary nature of the rule. Between 2007 and 2011, my colleagues and I conducted a study that shows that improving access to contraception promises to reduce our nation's unintended pregnancy and abortion rates dramatically. It isn't hard to understand why. Birth control lets women determine whether and when to have children. But that's not all. Women also need contraceptive care for other medical reasons, such as preventing ovarian or uterine cancer and regulating painful periods. There's a reason why the Affordable Care Act includes contraceptive care at no cost to the individual -- it's basic health care. We also know that cost is a factor in what contraception women use. Nearly one-third of women say they would change their contraception method if cost were not an issue. So what happens when cost is no longer an issue? That's what we tested during the Contraceptive CHOICE Project. During this long-term study, we offered more than 9,000 women the reversible contraceptive method of their choice while at the same time improving their knowledge of contraceptive methods and eliminating the most common barriers women face: cost and access. The results demonstrated the extraordinary promise of giving women the tools they need to control their reproductive lives. Three quarters of women chose the most effective methods of contraception: intrauterine devices and implants. This figure radically differs from the contraception chosen by women in the current landscape. Far fewer women in the general population use these methods, in large part because they are expensive. Our study suggests that when we remove cost barriers and improve education and access, as would be the case with full implementation of the contraceptive rule, we have the potential to make an astounding impact on the public health of women in our country. Wouldn't it be great if an unintended consequence of this mandate was a reduction in the number of unintended pregnancies and the need for abortions? Meeting the contraceptive needs of women will never be achieved when all methods of birth control are not equally accessible to every woman.","Colleen McNicholas: Court to rule on challenge to Obamacare contraception coverage rule .

"I'll let you know what's going on, but I don't need new congressional authority to act, President Barack Obama told congressional leaders Wednesday about his upcoming decision on possible military intervention in Iraq. The White House meeting sounded more like a listening session for the top Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate about options for helping Iraq's embattled Shiite government halt the lightning advance of Sunni Islamist fighters toward Baghdad that Obama is considering. According to a White House statement, Obama went over U.S. efforts to ""strengthen the capacity of Iraq's security forces to confront the threat"" from the  Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) fighters, ""including options for increased security assistance."" Earlier, spokesman Jay Carney spelled out one limit to any U.S. help, saying:  ""The President hasn't ruled out anything except sending U.S. combat troops into Iraq."" While the White House statement emphasized Obama would continue to consult with Congress, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the President ""basically just briefed us on the situation in Iraq and indicated he didn't feel he had any need for authority from us for the steps that he might take."" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California agreed with McConnell's assessment, adding she believed congressional authorization for military force in Iraq back in 2001 and 2003 still applied. Obama ""did not give us an array of actions he was planning to take,"" Pelosi said. ""He just talked about his perspective on what was happening there."" A few hours earlier, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said they were working out details on possible U.S. steps that could include airstrikes on Sunni militants advancing through northern Iraq. 'Full range of options' ""I share alarm about the future of Iraq, and we are developing a full range of options to help stabilize the region,"" Dempsey said at a Senate subcommittee hearing Wednesday. He and Hagel noted that final details, especially for airstrikes requested by the Iraqi government, required more intelligence on the ISIS fighters whose lightning sweep of Sunni territory has raised the specter of a partitioned Iraq and a broader Sunni-Shiite regional war. They agreed with subcommittee members that the Iraq crisis amounted to a threat to U.S. interests in the region and, down the road, a possible threat to the U.S. homeland if northern Iraq and neighboring Syria become a safe haven for al Qaeda-affiliated Islamists. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a conservative hawk critical of what he considers to be a weak U.S. foreign policy under Obama, noted that ISIS fighters have threatened to attack the United States. 'High-risk scenario' ""Although currently a regional threat, they do have aspirations to attack Western interests,"" Dempsey said, calling the safe haven outcome outlined by Graham a ""high-risk scenario."" ""Yeah, to our homeland being attacked by this group,"" Graham countered, to which Dempsey responded, ""not at this time but over time."" When Graham asked about possible U.S. airstrikes on the militant forces, Dempsey confirmed reports that the Iraqi government had requested them and added that it was ""in our national security interest to counter"" the ISIS fighters ""wherever we find them."" At the White House, Carney made clear that Obama's ""ultimate objective"" was to protect U.S. national security interests and prevent the region from becoming a safe haven for ISIS extremists. ""Any action that he might contemplate when it comes to ... the use of military force will be to deal with the immediate and medium-term threat posed by ISIL,"" Carney said, noting that 170 U.S. military personnel have been sent to Baghdad to assist in securing embassy personnel inside Iraq, while another 100  moved into the region to ""provide airfield management security and logistic support, if required."" Like other administration officials, he referred to the militants by the abbreviation for the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, rather than the common translation of the name that includes Syria. A draft list of possible ISIS targets in Iraq is being constantly reviewed and revised with the latest intelligence, typical of any preliminary targeting operation, according to U.S. military officials who spoke on the condition of not being identified. Compiling the draft list does not signal that Obama will authorize such strikes, and several administration officials said the President has yet to make a final decision. Manned reconnaissance . Several military sources also confirmed to CNN the start of manned reconnaissance flights over Iraq to collect up-to-the-minute intelligence on ISIS movements and positions. Unmanned reconnaissance flights have been going on for several days. In order to use precision-guided weapons, satellite coordinates generally would have to be loaded into them well in advance. That means the Defense Department needs to be ready to move quickly if Obama announces a decision to strike. The ""kinetic"" option against ISIS targets could include dropping precision-guided bombs from manned aircraft flying overhead, using Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from Navy ships in the Arabian Gulf or using drones to fire missiles. Military officials told CNN that the drone option was considered the least desirable because they fire against relatively small specific targets such as vehicles or individual suspected terrorists. For days, military sources have said ISIS fighters are dispersed and mixed in with local populations, making them difficult to target precisely with airstrikes. Washington political fight . On Capitol Hill, political leaders who later met with Obama sparred over the Iraq crisis in a debate intensified by the hyperpartisan atmosphere of an election year. House Speaker John Boehner demanded that Obama lay out a ""broader strategy"" for how the United States should deal with the growing sectarian violence in Iraq when he and other top congressional leaders meet with the President at the White House. Boehner sidestepped a question about whether he supported airstrikes and said it's up to the President to lay out what to do next. ""I'm looking for the overall strategy that will help secure the gains that we have made,"" Boehner said. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid spoke out forcefully against sending U.S. service members into the middle of sectarian strife. ""This is an Iraqi civil war, and it is time for Iraqis to resolve it themselves,"" the Nevada Democrat said on the Senate floor. ""It is not worth the blood of American service members.  It is not worth the monetary cost to the American taxpayer."" Militants' advance threatens Christians in Iraq . Opinion: Dick Cheney's amazing chutzpah on Iraq .

"Data from communications between satellites and missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was released Tuesday, more than two months after relatives of passengers say they requested that it be made public. But criticism quickly emerged suggesting that the information provided lacks important elements that would help outside experts put the official version of events to the test. Malaysian authorities published a 47-page document containing hundreds of lines of communication logs between the jetliner and the British company Inmarsat's satellite system. The information provided isn't the whole picture but is ""intended to provide a readable summary of the data communication logs,"" the notes at the beginning of the document say. In the weeks following the plane's March 8 disappearance, a team of international experts used the satellite data and other information, including radar data and engine performance calculations, to conclude that the aircraft ended up in a remote area of the southern Indian Ocean. Some passengers' families, unsatisfied by the official explanation of the plane's fate, say they want an independent analysis of the complex information, a process that could take some time. Michael Exner, one of the most vocal experts among those calling for the release of the data, said a very preliminary review suggested that there were gaps in the notes explaining the data. The explanatory notes at the start of the document ""answer a few of the questions we have had, but leave many questions unanswered,"" he told CNN. CNN safety analyst David Soucie said certain key elements, which would allow independent experts to fully test the official conclusion, are missing from the data in the document. ""There's not enough information to say whether they made an error,"" he said. ""I think we're still going to be looking for more."" Inmarsat CEO Rupert Pearce acknowledged Tuesday that the company didn't release the model to which it applied the data to estimate the plane's path -- and said the decision on whether to release the model lies with the Malaysian government, which is leading the search. ""We'd be perfectly happy to put that model out,"" Pearce told CNN's ""New Day."" But Pearce also told CNN that the released data is enough -- along with engine and radar data -- for experienced third parties to plug into their own models and reach their own conclusions. ""You shouldn't read anything into any gaps in the data,"" Inmarsat Senior Vice President Chris McLaughlin told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" on Tuesday. ""This is a very goodwill and focused way that we're trying to communicate our best impression of what happened."" Sarah Bajc, whose partner, Philip Wood, was on the missing jet, said she was ""annoyed"" that Inmarsat and Malaysian authorities hadn't released everything they used to reach their conclusions. ""I see no reason for them to have massaged this before giving it to us,"" she said. Is Inmarsat right? Data guided search . For weeks, Inmarsat said it didn't have the authority to release the data, deferring to Malaysian authorities, who are in charge of the search for the plane that disappeared over Southeast Asia while on a scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Last week, the two sides announced that they would aim to make the information available to the public. The satellite signals -- called ""handshakes"" -- with MH370 were part of a larger set of data that investigators have used to try to establish the whereabouts of the missing Boeing 777 with 239 people on board. The handshakes continued to take place for roughly six hours after the aircraft dropped off radar screens. Months of searching by dozens of planes and ships in the southern Indian Ocean has so far turned up no wreckage, and investigators have not been able to say for sure where the remains of MH370 might be. The underwater search for the missing plane will effectively be put on hold this week, and may not resume until August at the earliest, according to Australia's top transport safety official. Analysts have said the release of the satellite data could help discount some theories about what happened to the jetliner, and potentially fuel new ones. Relatives of people who were on the passenger jet, scientists studying its disappearance and media covering the search have become increasingly critical about the lack of public information about why the search has focused on the southern Indian Ocean. ""I think far too much has been left to experts who have remained behind the curtain,"" said K.S. Narendran, whose wife, Chandrika Sharma, was on the flight. Inmarsat confident . Even though more than 80 days have passed without searchers finding any wreckage from the plane, Inmarsat officials say they remain confident in their data. ""Yes, to a high degree of probability, we are certain that our data is right,"" McLaughlin said Tuesday. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Richard Quest last week, Inmarsat's vice president of satellite operations said the company's calculations have been tested by other people. ""No one has come up yet with a reason why it shouldn't work with this particular flight when it has worked with others,"" Mark Dickinson said. ""And it's very important this isn't just an Inmarsat activity. There are other people doing investigations, experts who are helping the investigation team, who have got the same data, who made their own models up and did the same thing to see if they got the same results and broadly speaking, they got roughly the same answers."" Experts came to the conclusion that the plane had ended up in the southern Indian Ocean by piecing together three types of information, he said. ""We have actually the messages from the ground station to the plane and back again. That essentially tells you the terminal is switched on and powered up. We have some timing information and in addition to that there were some frequency measurements,"" he said. The timings told them the distance between the plane and the satellite, enabling them to map out arcs. Then they factored in frequency differences, determining that the plane had headed south. 'The right work' It was a startling conclusion -- and Dickinson says investigators made sure to repeatedly check their calculations before sharing them. ""You want to make sure when you come to a conclusion like that, that you've done the right work, the data is as you understand it to be,"" he said. Now, Dickinson says he's well aware that the entire weight of the search rests on the Inmarsat data. ""This is all the data we have for what has happened for those six or so hours,"" he said. ""It's important we all get it right and particularly that everyone looking at the data makes the best judgments on it and how it's used. And particularly for the families and friends of the relatives on board, try and make sure that we can help bring this sad incident to a close."" Quest said he thinks the expertise of the Inmarsat team and the level of testing to which their work was subjected justifies their confidence in their conclusions. ""It is up to the detractors and doubters to come up and say why they believe it's wrong,"" he said. ""Not the other way around."" Bajc acknowledged that independent analysis of the data may support Inmarsat's conclusions. ""That would be a fine outcome as far as I'm concerned,"" she said. But if the independent experts come up with alternative flight paths based on the data, Bajc said, then ""those need to be investigated."" The wait for data . The issue of making the satellite data public has become the cause of confusion and contradictory statements. Bajc said the families had first asked for the data more than two months ago. ""It seemed a relatively innocent request"" at the time, she said, but authorities refused to release it. Malaysian officials told CNN earlier this month that their government did not have the data. But Inmarsat officials said the company provided all of it to Malaysian officials ""at an early stage in the search."" ""We've shared the information that we had, and it's for the investigation to decide what and when it puts out,"" McLaughlin said earlier this month. But a senior Malaysian official told CNN that the government needed Inmarsat's help to pass on the data to families ""in a presentable way."" ""We are trying to be as transparent as possible,"" the official said. ""We have no issues releasing the data."" Bajc said the delay only added to questions surrounding the information. ""It's a little curious to me why this had to become such a big deal,"" she said Tuesday. Did Inmarsat data point Flight 370 searchers in wrong direction?

"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN)  -- Ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya said he and supporters holed up at the Brazilian Embassy were victims of a ""neurotoxic"" gas attack Friday morning that caused many people to have nose bleeds and breathing difficulties. Soldiers stand guard Friday at the perimeter around the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. An official with Brazil's Foreign Ministry told CNN there was some type of gas used in the area but could not confirm it was a nerve agent. Some embassy employees felt minor symptoms, said the official, who did not want his name used because that is foreign ministry protocol. Roberto Micheletti, who was named president after the June 28 coup that removed Zelaya, told CNN on Friday afternoon that his government did not launch a gas attack on the embassy. A high-ranking police official had told CNN earlier that Zelaya's allegation was a ""totally false statement."" Journalists, including CNN correspondent John Zarrella, were kept several blocks away from the embassy in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, and could not confirm whether a gas attack had taken place. Zelaya and his aides said at a news conference that a local public health specialist they identified as Dr. Mauricio Castellano took air samples near the embassy after the attack and determined that the gas contained HCN, an abbreviation for hydrogen cyanide. HCN can cause dryness and burning of the throat, shortness of breath, convulsion, coma and cardiovascular collapse. Zelaya said he felt irritation in his throat and eyes Friday morning and went outside to get fresh air. When he did so, he said, he noticed that many people were sick. ""Practically all of us have felt the effects of these gases,"" he said. Andres Tamayo, who was with Zelaya at the embassy and identified himself as a priest, said the chemical attack came from three sources: neighboring houses that have been evacuated, a white truck that was seen near the embassy and a low-flying helicopter. ""This is a terrorist act,"" Tamayo said. Zelaya has been staying at the Brazilian Embassy since secretly returning to Honduras on Monday.  Watch as CNN's Rick Sanchez talks to Zelaya and de facto leader Roberto Micheletti » . He showed photographs at the briefing that he said were of soldiers setting up gas-delivery systems and noise machines in neighboring yards. The United Nations Security Council met Friday morning to discuss Brazil's concern over what is happening at its embassy. Brazil called for the meeting several days ago. About 3,000 Zelaya supporters marched peacefully down a major boulevard Friday in the capital. Police and soldiers in riot gear lined the street but there were no reports of violence or arrests, CNN correspondent Zarrella said from the scene.

"Dennis Marx wore body armor and a gas mask. He brandished an assault rifle, an assortment of grenades, ""all kinds of ammunition"" and even used his silver Nissan SUV as a weapon of sorts, according to authorities. The 48-year-old man toted his own water supply and flexible handcuffs, presumably to corral hostages once he got inside the north Georgia courthouse. As Forsyth County Sheriff Duane Piper said, ""He came prepared to do this."" But Dennis Marx never even made it inside. A nearly three-minute long gunfight Friday ended with Marx dead, after being confronted by a swarm of law enforcement officers. They seemingly came from everywhere -- from the jail across the street, as part of a SWAT team that happened to be nearby and even inside the courthouse where they busted out windows in order to get more angles to target the attacked. Piper singled out one officer in particular -- a veteran sheriff's deputy who first confronted Marx, who then tried to run the deputy over -- for his vital part in deterring the attacker. Shot twice in the leg, the deputy was the only person wounded despite what the sheriff called ""a full frontal assault."" ""It was very close to being a major catastrophe,"" Piper said. ""The deputy that was shot ... averted what, I think, would have been a lot more deaths."" Swift, significant response to attack . Marx was supposed to be at the Forsyth County Courthouse in Cumming. Court documents show he faced 11 felony charges --  10 of them related to the manufacture, possession and sale of illicit drugs, including marijuana, plus one count of having a firearm while in the commission of a felony -- dating back to August 2011. According to the sheriff's office, he was expected to enter a plea Friday before Chief Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Bagley. Needless to say, he never made it. Instead, around 10 a.m. Friday, Marx drove up to the courthouse, threw out ""homemade spike strips"" to delay any police response, and tried to run over the deputy, Piper said. The deputy -- a 30-year veteran whose duties include canvassing the scene outside the courthouse -- opened fire, and Marx returned fire through his windshield. He didn't stop with bullets. According to the sheriff, Marx tossed tear gas grenades, smoke grenades and pepper spray grenades -- something he could do more easily with his gas mask strapped on. Despite this barrage of weapons, the sheriff's deputy was able to distract Marx, to slow him. Even a little delay made a big difference, as officers armed with assault rifles came over from the jail across the street. A SWAT team pulled up about 30 seconds into the firefight and engaged the attacker, according to Piper. The sheriff initially estimated the whole thing took 90 seconds but, after watching more video, he doubled that time. However long it lasted, it ended with Marx dead of multiple gunshot wounds. With eight officers opening fire at one point, authorities don't yet know which one of them fired the fatal shot. 'He was there to occupy the courthouse' Afterward, the wounded deputy -- identified by local media as James Daniel Rush -- was transported to a local hospital. There, the officer had surgery for fractures to his  fibula and tibia in the lower right leg, injuries Piper said weren't life-threatening. But his colleagues still had to work to do. They went to Marx's home in Cumming, a small city about 35 northeast of downtown Atlanta, with every expectation that it was booby trapped. As Piper said: ""Last time we were at the home, we were suspicious because it had been booby trapped before."" Once they finally made their way in and cleared the house, they found homemade explosives, according to a law enforcement source. It wasn't clear whether those were attempted booby traps. A preliminary investigation found that Marx hadn't been in his Cumming home for about 10 days. Besides that, little is known about him beyond that he began working at the Transportation Security Administration in October 2002, according to a U.S. official, and left either the next year or in 2004. The sheriff said Friday that he and others weren't ready yet to discuss Marx's motive or his thinking. That said, Piper said it was evident that Marx ""came prepared to stay a while."" ""We don't know who he was coming to the courthouse for, but with the flex ties and the restraining devices he had with him,"" said the sheriff. ""We have to assume that he was there to occupy the courthouse."" Who is the student who pounded on the Seattle gunman? Canada shooting: Suspect yelled 'I'm done' at time of arrest .

"An Illinois jury on Thursday found former Chicago-area police sergeant Drew Peterson guilty of murder in the 2004 death of his ex-wife. The jury of seven men and five women deliberated for nearly 14 hours total before delivering its verdict convicting Peterson in the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio. ""Finally somebody heard Kathleen's cry,"" her mother, Marcia Savio, told reporters after the verdict. ""Twelve people did the right thing, oh thank God."" Savio was found dead in her dry, clean bathtub on March 1, 2004. While prosecutors claimed Peterson killed Savio, the defense contended that she fell, hit her head and drowned. The headline-grabbing case did not arise until after Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy, disappeared in October 2007. It was during the search for Stacy Peterson -- who has not been found -- that investigators said they would look again into Savio's death, which was initially ruled an accidental drowning. In February 2008, authorities altered their judgment and ruled Savio's death a homicide. Peterson was later arrested and charged with first-degree murder. Peterson was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Cales, who later became his fourth wife. Savio and Peterson filed for divorce in October 2001 and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years. Bolingbrook, Illinois, police records indicate officers were called to Savio's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004. Peterson had Savio arrested twice for domestic violence, though she was found not guilty in both cases. On February 27, 2004, Peterson picked up his two sons from Savio's home and spent the next two days with them. Prosecutors said he entered her home again early on February 29 and killed her. At the time of her death, a court was mulling how the couple's marital assets would be divided, and Savio was set to receive part of Peterson's pension and other support. ""We have left-front injuries, left-side injuries, left-back injuries, right injuries, right and left injuries,"" prosecutor Chris Koch said in his closing argument, disputing the defense assertion Savio's death was an accident. ""So it's not just one side of her body; it's multiple sides, four sides. ""How can you get that in one fall? You can't. You can't do it. It's not possible."" The jury released a statement, read outside the Joliet courthouse by Will County Sheriff's Office Deputy Ken Kaupas, in which they thanked the judge, bailiffs and sheriff's office and said they took their responsibility seriously. ""We have reached a decision we believe is just,"" the jurors said. The more-than-monthlong trial was marked by repeated missteps by the prosecution that angered Judge Edward Burmila and the defense. At least four times, prosecutors allowed witnesses to testify to details Burmila had told them not to go into -- such as whether Savio had a protective order against her husband or allowing a witness to demonstrate climbing into a bathtub. In some cases the defense sought a mistrial and in others they asked the judge to strike entire testimony. Burmila instead ordered the jury to disregard elements of the testimony that went against his orders. ""The disrespect to the court is shocking,"" Burmila told the prosecution last week. On Thursday, Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow expressed confidence the conviction, which he called ""very sobering,"" will stand up against appeal. ""We took him on and we won,"" he said of Peterson, whom he called ""a coward and a bully."" ""This defendant brutally killed Kathleen Savio."" HLN: Critical moments in the Drew Peterson trial . After Thursday's verdict, Peterson's defense team stood by their client and promised to continue their fight on his behalf. Lawyer Joel Brodsky contended there was a large amount of bias against Peterson before the trial even began. ""He is absolutely innocent,"" Brodsky said of Peterson, claiming the prosecution's case ""was based almost entirely on hearsay."" He called Savio's death ""a household accident."" The Savio family, though, didn't hide their contempt for what the victim's brother, Nick, called Peterson's ""clown defense team who made fun of this whole trial."" Nick Savio called Thursday's verdict ""bittersweet,"" describing the jury's decision as ""fantastic"" while also lamenting it wouldn't bring back his sister. He added that his family wants Drew Peterson to next be held responsible for whatever happened to Stacy Peterson. ""Although we cannot have Kathleen back, we hope she can now rest in peace and that she knows she has had her day,"" Nick Savio said, reading out a statement from family. ""She will be missed and remembered in our hearts always. ""Stacy, you are now next for justice."" Cassandra Cales, Stacy Peterson's sister, said she hopes the verdict will spur someone to come forward ""who knows something about my sister, (because) they feel safe to talk now."" While she says she is still trying to process the import of the jury's decision, Cales said one thought went through her mind immediately after hearing it: ""Game over, Drew.""

"Just in time for Albert Einstein's birthday Thursday, scientists delivered exciting news about how the universe works. Last summer, physicists announced that they had identified a particle with characteristics of the elusive Higgs boson, the so-called ""God particle."" But, as often the case in science, they needed to do more research to be more certain. On Thursday, scientists announced that the particle, detected at the Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful particle-smasher, looks even more like the Higgs boson. The news came at the Moriond Conference in La Thuile, Italy, from scientists at the Large Hadron Collider's ATLAS and Compact Muon Solenoid experiments. These two detectors are looking for unusual particles that slip into existence when subatomic particles crash into one another at high energies. ""The preliminary results with the full 2012 data set are magnificent and to me it is clear that we are dealing with a Higgs boson though we still have a long way to go to know what kind of Higgs boson it is,"" Joe Incandela, spokesperson for the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment, said in a statement. Scientists have analyzed two and a half times more data than they had when the first announced the Higgs boson results last July 4. The Higgs boson is associated with the reason that everything in the universe -- from humans to planets to galaxies -- have mass. The particle is a component of something called the Higgs field, which permeates our universe. It's not a perfect analogy, but Brian Greene, theoretical physicist at Columbia University and ""NOVA"" host, offered this comparison when I spoke with him last year: . ""You can think of it as a kind of molasses-like bath that's invisible, but yet we're all immersed within it,"" Greene said. ""And as particles like electrons try to move through the molasses-like bath, they experience a resistance. And that resistance is what we, in our big everyday world, think of as the mass of the electron."" The electron would have no mass if it were not for this ""substance,"" the field made of Higgs particles. So, without the Higgs boson, we would not be here at all. How particle smasher and telescopes relate . Many physicists hate the term ""God particle"" because it did not originate in the way you might think. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Leon Lederman wrote a book with ""God Particle"" in the title, but reportedly said he'd actually wanted to call it the ""Goddamn Particle."" Having evidence that the Higgs boson really exists is important for the current understanding of how the universe works. An amazing fact about the Higgs boson is that scientists predicted its existence and then detected it (or something that strongly resembles it), rather than the other way around. They didn't see an abnormality and wonder what it was. The particle confirms notions about the universe that had only been calculated, but not directly observed. But scientists do not know if the particle they've found is truly the one predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. That model is the best explanation out there for what happens at scales smaller than the atom, but still has a lot of holes in it, and there are other theories out there that go beyond that model. It is possible that the Higgs boson found at the Large Hadron Collider could fit into those other theories. To figure that out, scientists must look at how fast the boson decays into other particles, and see how the decay rate stacks up against predictions. The Large Hadron Collider is located in a 17-mile tunnel near the French-Swiss border, and is operated by CERN, the European Organization of Nuclear Research. The $10 billion particle-smasher set a record in 2012 for the amount of energy achieved in particle collisions: 8 trillion electron volts (TeV). The LHC shut down last month for a long staycation full of maintenance and upgrades. After about two years, it will come back online with 13 TeV. Detecting the Higgs boson takes a lot of particle collisions -- there's only one observed event in every trillion proton-proton collisions, CERN said. The Higgs boson news coincides not only with Einstein's birthday, but also with Pi Day, March 14. These events are not entirely unrelated: Incandela told CNN last year that the number pi comes up in Large Hadron Collider calculations. For instance, scientists need to use pi when calculating how  ""loops"" -- particles that transform themselves into other particles, and then come back together to make the original particle again -- contribute to a particle's mass.

"(CNN)Who doesn't like a new look? New Year, new you, amiright? An updated 'do can ""hair-ald"" a new phase in your life, signifying a fresh start. And maybe that's what the reclusive leader of North Korea was going for when he modified his almost boyish over-the-top-flop to a higher, angular, more severe cut. The look first debuted at his New Year's address in January. After all, Kim Jong Un -- following in the footsteps of his father, Kim Jong Il, dear leader and eternal chief  of the Workers' Party of Korea -- is cracking down. A resolution he read at the meeting of the party's Central Committee on Wednesday reminded party organizations that they must ""wage an all-party intensive campaign against abuse of power, bureaucratism, irregularities and corruption,"" according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. Kim's new image got attention on social media, with some asking -- tongue in cheek -- if the new hairstyle was a nod to his father and grandfather. ""Kim Jong Un has an amazing new haircut. We have many, many questions,"" Amanda Taub wrote on Vox.com. Others jumped in to share their feelings on the fade. ""The Joey Essex haircut goes drastically wrong as it reaches North Korea,"" tweeted Adam Taylor. Some commented on the new shape of the style. ""Kim Jong Un shows off new trapezoidal hair style, tiny eyebrows,"" said Allen & Kelley Co. The resolution read by Kim at the meeting also called on party organizations to ""conduct the organizational and political work in a fresh and viable manner so that the officials, party members and working people may turn out as one with the revolutionary faith, fighting spirit and revolutionary pluck to devotedly carry out the teachings of Kim Jong Il and the party's policies under any condition."" Speaking of ""pluck"" -- Kim's eyebrows also apparently had a brush with the scissors, or tweezers. Recent photos show a much-abbreviated set atop a face that looks a little larger. Maybe the smaller eyebrows make it seem that way. But surely the 30-something leader of one of the most closed-off countries in the world has more important things to do than to worry himself with such superficial matters. Like coming up with some more patriotic slogans to mark the 70th anniversary of the isolated regime's founding this year. Some of the more colorful so far:  ""Let us turn ours into a country of mushrooms!"" (presumably not a reference to Kim's old hairstyle) or ""More stylish school uniforms ... for our dear children!"" It's not clear if the dear children will be urged to emulate their dear leader's new 'do.

"Global warming has propelled Earth's climate from one of its coldest decades since the last ice age to one of its hottest -- in just one century. A heat spike like this has never happened before, at least not in the last 11,300 years, said climatologist Shaun Marcott, who worked on a new study on global temperatures going back that far. ""If any period in time had a sustained temperature change similar to what we have today, we would have certainly seen that in our record,"" he said.  It is a good indicator of just how fast man-made climate change has progressed. A century is a very short period of time for such a spike. It's supposed to be cold . The Earth was very cold at the turn of the 20th century. The decade from 1900 to 1909 was colder than 95% of the last 11,300 years, the study found. Fast forward to the turn of the 21st century, and the opposite occurs.  Between 2000 and 2009, it was hotter than about 75% of the last 11,300 years. If not for man-made influences, the Earth would be in a very cold phase right now and getting even colder, according the joint study by Oregon State University and Harvard University.  Marcott was the lead author of the report on its results. To boot, the range of temperatures from cold to hot produced since the industrial revolution began are about the same as the 11,000 years before it, said Candace Major from the National Science Foundation, ""but this change has happened a lot more quickly."" Far from natural warming . Variations in how the Earth is tilted and its orbit around the sun make for a pattern of planetary warming phases followed by cooling phases across the millennia. The team's research shows the Earth's overall temperature curve dipping down over about the past 4,000 years, but the downward plod comes to an abrupt halt in modern times. ""If you were to predict -- based on where we are relative to the position of the sun and how we are tilted -- you would predict that we would be still cooling, but we're not,"" Marcott said. Instead, the planet is warming up. It hasn't been quite this warm in thousands of years. And it's getting hotter. By 2100, the Earth will be warmer than ever before, Marcott said. If emissions continue as currently predicted until then, global temperatures will rise ""well above anything we've ever seen in the last 11,000 years."" That could be a rise of 2 to 11.5 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the NSF. What a long range study means . To get a view on global temperatures that long ago, the researchers studied 73 sediment and polar ice samples, taken from all over the globe. Chemicals found in fossils deep down in the samples span the ages and are good indicators of historic temperatures on Earth, Marcott said. The scientists did the study to put the global temperature trends into a long-range perspective, Marcott said. Critics of climate change research, which has generally covered the last 1,500 to 2,000 years, have complained that it has been too short-sighted. They argue that the shorter studies have not taken into account that the warming Earth is seeing today could have happened before naturally -- thousands of years ago. These shorter studies have been based on methods that are very different from the Harvard-OSU research, but in the 2,000 years that they overlap, the results have been basically the same. ""Our data shows that ... they didn't miss anything,"" Marcott said. And the parallel results corroborate the precision of the new research as well, he said. Humanity in the last 11,500 years . The scientists chose the period of time known as the ""Holocene"" for their research, because it is the most recent natural warm phase in Earth's history. It began at the end of the last Ice Age about 11,500 years ago, and we are still in it. The Holocene has also been the epoch of human achievement, the beginning of civilization. Stable weather patterns helped people do more of everything they wanted to, partly because they no longer had to fight the cold of an ice age. They began farming, which extended their own life spans and increased population on Earth. They built cities and roads, made art, developed languages and laws.  They formed empires and nations. Eventually, they invented machines, landing themselves in the industrialized age, driven by engines and turbines, which are powered by combustible fuel. Thus began man-made greenhouse gases. The world tomorrow . The main culprit is carbon dioxide, and its levels have jumped in the last 100 years, Marcott said. In the 11,000 years prior, it only changed ""very slowly,"" he said. Marcott is concerned about people's ability to adapt to a perhaps drastically changed climate. ""As civilization has grown, we're kind of set up for things not to change too much,"" he said. The last time Earth has been as warm as it is projected to be by 2100 was before the last Ice Age started -- over 130,000 years ago.  That's too long ago to gather reliable data on, he said. He didn't want to speculate on what the world will look like, if global warming continues. ""I certainly hope we can pull ourselves out of it,"" he said.","If greenhouse gas emissions progress, Earth will become hotter than ever in 90 years .
The temperature rise during man-made global warming has not happened before .
1900 - 1909 was one of the coldest decades in 11,300 years .
2000 - 2009 was one of the hottest decades in 11,300 years ."
"In some ways, it's just a number, but it's a big number with enormous implications. For the first time, scientists measured an average concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide of 400 parts per million in Mauna Loa, Hawaii, where the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration observatory is located, on Thursday. ""Most experts that really study CO2 amounts estimate that we haven't seen that amount of CO2 in our atmosphere in about 3 million years,"" said J. Marshall Shepherd, climate change expert and professor at the University of Georgia. In other words, modern humans have never seen carbon dioxide in these proportions before. Scientists say it's apparent that human activity -- namely burning coal, oil and natural gas -- has been driving a rapid rise of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide changes climate and drives acidification of the ocean. ""Once emitted, it remains for the ocean atmosphere system for thousands of years, warming the planet. It changes climate and is driving ocean acidification all that time,"" said Jim Butler, a senior scientist at NOAA. Among the many risks of rising temperatures, agriculture, forestry, ecosystems and human health are all expected to suffer as a result of trends in climate change. Turbulence ahead as climate changes . The amount of carbon dioxide varies daily somewhat and has cycled historically in accordance with changes in the Earth's orbit, a phenomenon known as Milankovitch cycles. But the exponential rise in carbon dioxide levels since the Industrial Revolution is far out of the ordinary, experts say. The number 400 parts per million is symbolic of what many scientists believe to be the inevitable growth of this gas in our atmosphere, Shepherd said. Getting to this number was to be expected. ""It also is kind of a warning sign or red flag that hey, we really need to tackle this problem,"" he said. ""It's happening right before our eyes."" In about eight to 10 years, levels will not go under 400 parts per million, Butler said. And in terms of reaching new carbon dioxide highs, 450 will come even faster than than the change from 350 to 400, given observed trends, Shepherd said. For comparison, the last time annual CO2 was 350 parts per million was in the 1980s. Butler likens the phenomenon to an electric blanket. When you turn the dial, it takes a little while to warm up. It's as if humans have turned the dial on Earth's blanket, and we'll feel the heat only in a matter of time. ""Even if we stopped emitting CO2, temperatures would still rise for at least a decade or two because the system has to catch up with it,"" Butler said. Most carbon dioxide is in the Northern Hemisphere, because most people on the planet live in these parts, Butler said. In 2012, monitoring stations in the Arctic measured 400 parts per million, but this is a new high at Mauna Loa. The global average will catch up in a year or two, he said. Since scientists began measuring at Mauna Loa in 1958, the concentration of carbon dioxide has been increasing every year, NOAA said. The rate of this rise has been accelerating, from 0.7 ppm per year in the late 1950s to 2.1 ppm per year over the last decade. Before the 19th-century Industrial Revolution, the average carbon dioxide concentration worldwide was about 280 parts per million. Over the course of the past 800,000 years, says NOAA, these levels bounced between 180 and 280 parts per million. NOAA: Watch history of carbon dioxide levels . You might be wondering how the planet could be warming if this past winter has been relatively cool. Shepherd explains that weather is akin to mood, but climate is analogous to personality. Weather changes a lot, but climate is something more fundamental, causing overall patterns. Study: Climate change may contribute to civil wars . It may appear that, in the grand scheme of things, there's not a lot of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to begin with. The most abundant gas is nitrogen, at 78%, followed by oxygen at 21%. Having a tiny amount of carbon dioxide is essential for our survival; without it, the planet would be too cold. Opinion: How to fight climate change . But too much carbon dioxide, which leads to too much overall warming, is bad. While it's impossible to say that any particular event was ""caused by global warming,"" says Shepherd, climate change loads the deck, making extreme events such as last year's Superstorm Sandy more likely. These storms also become more disastrous with rising sea levels. The sea level near New York City was about 10 inches higher in 2012 than in 1900, Shepherd said. The Mauna Loa station is the oldest in the world to measure carbon dioxide. ""It's an alarming marker that we've passed,"" Butler said. ""Mauna Loa, the iconic site for CO2, has reached 400 for the first time over a day. That's big.""

"There's an attempted coup in progress in Venezuela, an attempt orchestrated and directed by political and financial elites in the United States. Outlandish?  Not if you ask Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who spoke at length during a news conference Friday night about his allegations of conspiracy, which others call conspiracy theories. His staff made sure foreign media, including CNN journalists, got an invitation. The news conference, carried live on state-run TV, lasted two hours and 28 minutes.  It may have seemed like an eternity to foreign correspondents, but it was brief by Venezuelan standards, especially compared to Maduro's predecessor. The late President Hugo Chavez would talk politics, economics, and baseball for hours on end.  He would occasionally serenade Venezuelans while addressing the entire nation on live TV. ""There's a world campaign against Venezuela,"" Maduro told correspondents.  ""It's a campaign to justify an intervention in the domestic affairs of Venezuela."" It's a talking point Chavez, who died of cancer last year, also made frequently. Talk about foreign invasion or intervention resonates with loyalists and galvanizes members of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela. Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader, spoke not only about alleged conspiracies involving an international plan to destabilize his government, but also about Venezuelan and Latin American history, United States politics, democracy, the right to a free higher education, free trade agreements, the Venezuelan opposition and Spider Man, just to name a few. He spent a good portion of the news conference blaming foreign media for what he called ""a brutal manipulation campaign."" The campaign ""has created the perception in the world that Venezuela is on the verge of civil war, that here in Venezuela we have a group of docile students opposing an illegitimate government,"" Maduro said. The president had denied or revoked press credentials for seven CNN journalists the day before.  At the news conference, he announced CNN could continue reporting inside Venezuela. The president also apologized on behalf of Venezuela for an armed robbery against a CNN team and said the incident is being investigated. At least eight people have died in the last two weeks in clashes at anti-government protests throughout Venezuela.  Among the victims was Genesis Carmona, 22, a beauty queen who was shot in the head while participating in a protest in the city of Valencia. Protesters complain the socialist government has mismanaged the country creating all kinds of problems including insecurity, shortages of food and basic products (like toilet paper), blackouts and rampant inflation that last year reached 56 percent, according to the Central Bank of Venezuela. Maduro blames most of the problems on a foreign conspiracy. An opposition leader, Leopoldo Lopez, turned himself in on Tuesday after being charged with arson and conspiracy during the protests.  Maduro says his government had to take the former mayor and presidential candidate to a jail in military complex ""to protect him"" from a conspiracy to kill him. Asked about the polarization of Venezuela, Maduro said ""there's no democracy without a politicized people."" Asked about why tensions between loyalists and the opposition have increased, he said, ""you the media have fanned the flames of hatred."" The criticism against his government happens because ""he who leads gets hit the most,"" Maduro said. In spite of recent tensions, the socialists have had important electoral victories in Venezuela -- 18 victories at the ballot box since 1999, according to Maduro. The ruling party obtained 55 percent of the vote in local elections in December, even though Maduro himself won the presidency with a margin of only 1.4%. ""A win is a win,"" he said. In spite of blasting the United States multiple times, Maduro extended an olive branch, saying he would like to open a dialogue with the country that buys 40 percent of Venezuelan oil. A start, he said, would be to once again exchange ambassadors. He also said that as a child he would wear Spider-Man or Superman costumes and that he gets excited when he listens to blues music. ""I think I might've been from Mississippi in another life, right?,"" he said with a smile. Maduro is nearing the end of his first year of a 6-year presidential term and hinted he wouldn't mind staying longer in power. But he carefully clarified that he believes in democracy and has invited the opposition multiple times to talk. ""Dictator?  What dictator?"" he said.","President Maduro shares the conspiracy theories of Hugo Chavez .

"Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan confirmed what has been rumored for decades -- that he secretly helped Israel develop its nuclear weapons program. Milchan, who has produced dozens of major movies and worked with the biggest stars, worked for Israel's now-defunct spy unit Bureau of Scientific Relations, he told Israeli television's Uvda ""Fact 14"" show. A 2011 book detailed Milchan's secret work, but until now he has not talked openly about his life of espionage. Milchan, whose films include ""Fight Club,"" ""Pretty Woman,"" and ""L.A. Confidential,"" set up and operated dozens of companies that helped Israel obtain parts and plans for its nuclear project in the 1980s, he said. ""I did it for my country and I'm proud of it,"" Milchan told interviewer Ilana Dayan in a report aired this week. His spy work was a rumor in the 1980s when Milchan was producing movies, including ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Once Upon a Time in America"" with actor Robert De Niro. De Niro sat with Milchan for an interview with Dayan for the show.  He said he suspected something about the producer's ""ventures"" decades ago, but ""I wasn't sure."" He didn't question his producer about the rumors because ""it wasn't my business,"" he said.  ""He didn't ask me certain things and I don't ask him. "" Milchan: 'Wow! The action! That was exciting' Milchan -- born in 1944 in what was then Palestine -- was a successful young businessman in the United States when his friend Shimon Peres -- who later became Israel's prime minister -- recruited him to help after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Uvda report said. Israeli spy officials used bank accounts set up by Milchan to make weapons-related purchases around the world, including helicopters and missiles, the report said. ""Do you know what it was like to be a 20-something guy whose country decided to let him be James Bond?  Wow!  The action!  That was exciting,"" Milchan told Dayan. Milchan told how he convinced a German engineer to let him photograph plans for a nuclear facility. When the FBI discovered one of his companies was used to ship nuclear triggers to Israel without proper licenses, it resulted in the 1985 indictment of an executive who was involved.  Charges against Milchan were dropped by the Reagan administration. ""I didn't know Israel ordered the triggers,"" Milchan told Dayan.  ""I didn't even know what triggers were."" He also acknowledged helping the government of South Africa with public relations when it was under intense international criticism and sanctions because of its apartheid system.  His help was in exchange for uranium supplied to Israel from South Africa, he said. Director Sidney Pollack, whose films included ""Tootsie"" and ""Out of Africa,"" was ""my partner in export in aerospace, planes, all kinds of things, with license,"" Milchan said.  ""He had to decide what he was willing and what he was not.  On many things he said 'No.' Many things he said 'Yes.' "" Milchan is a multi-billionaire, but he insisted that he never profited from his spy work.","Israeli spy agency used Milchan's companies to make weapons-related purchases .

"North and South Korean artillery batteries exchanged hundreds of shells across their western sea border Monday, a day after North Korea warned it was preparing to test  another nuclear device. About 100 of the 500 shells North Korea fired into the Yellow Sea strayed across the line separating the two rivals' territorial waters, the semiofficial South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. Yonhap quoted the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff as saying the South responded by firing about 300 shells into North Korean waters and dispatching fighter jets to the boundary, known as the Northern Limit Line. North Korean offshore firing appeared to have resumed after a lull, Yonhap reported, citing a resident of Baekryong Island, which is close to the Northern Limit Line. ""Some (North Korean) artillery fire landed in (the) southern part of Northern Limit Line but in the water,"" a South Korean Ministry of Defense spokesman said. ""We counter-fired over the Northern Limit Line."" When asked what South Korea fired back at, the defense spokesman said, ""We are not shooting at North Korea, just shooting into the sea."" The United States, South Korea's leading ally, condemned the North Korean shelling from the White House and the Pentagon. Washington is working ""in close coordination"" with South Korea and Japan, White House spokesman Jay Carney said, calling on North Korea ""to refrain from actions that threaten regional peace and security."" And Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters at the Pentagon, ""The provocation that the North Koreans have, once again, engaged in is dangerous, and it needs to stop."" China, the North's main patron, also expressed concern. ""The temperature is rising at present on the Korean Peninsula, and this worries us,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters in Beijing. ""We hope that all sides can remain calm and exercise restraint."" Warning fax . The normally reclusive North took the unusual step of informing its neighbor of live-fire drills close in the heavily militarized western sea. Pyongyang sent a fax early Monday demanding that the South ""control"" its vessels in seven areas of the waterway near the Northern Limit Line. According to Wee Yong-Sub, a vice spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, the scheduled tests mark the first time -- in recent history, at least -- that the North has announced live-firing exercises above the maritime border. ""We consider such announcement as a hostile threat and so have activated crisis management operation in case of (military) provocation,"" he said. ""We stress that we are fully prepared for all situations."" Victor Cha, a leading Korea analyst, told CNN that the North may be ""posturing"" for attention in hopes bringing Washington back to talks over its nuclear program -- or moving while the United States distracted by other global events. ""They could be learning from Crimea that while the United States is distracted, the North Koreans can try to change the playing field and maybe slant it in their direction by pushing it back to talks while the United States is focused on other issues,"" Cha said. The two Koreans never signed a peace agreement after the 1950-53 war that also pitted the United States and China against each other. Cha called it a ""clearly a good thing"" that Pyongyang notified the South of its military exercise. But if Northern gunners ended up killing someone across the border, ""then we're in a pretty bad situation."" ""They are on a hair trigger, and because of the array of forces on the peninsula, you can get an action-reaction dynamic that escalates fairly quickly,"" he said. ""That's something we want to avoid, of course."" Nuclear tests . North Korea said Sunday that it ""would not rule out"" a new nuclear test as it defended its recent mid-range missile launch that triggered international condemnation. ""(We) would not rule out a new form of a nuclear test aimed at strengthening our nuclear deterrence,"" Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the state-run KCNA news agency. ""The U.S. had better ponder over this and stop acting rashly."" The statement did not specify what North Korea meant by a ""new form"" of test, and Wee said there are no immediate signs of nuclear tests being carried out by the North. Last week, Pyongyang launched two medium-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast, violating United Nations resolutions that prohibit Pyongyang from conducting such tests. The Security Council condemned the move and is considering an ""appropriate response,"" said Luxembourg Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, the council's current president. The military exercises are the latest provocation by the North and come after a maritime dispute last week was seemingly swiftly resolved. On Thursday, a North Korean fishing boat was seized after an alleged incursion into South Korean waters and returned with its three crew members the following day. And while North Korea often upsets its neighbors by firing various rockets and missiles into the waters surrounding the Korean Peninsula, the country has at times engaged in more deadly military actions. A multinational 2010 report indicated that the sinking of the South Korean navy warship Cheonan, which killed 46 sailors in the Yellow Sea, was the result of a a North Korean torpedo. Later that year, North Korean artillery attacks on Yeonpyeong Island in the Yellow Sea killed two South Korean marines in what Yonhap called ""the first direct artillery attack on South Korean territory since the Korean War ended in an armistice"" in 1953.

"The preliminary results of an autopsy that Michael Brown's family requested are unlikely to settle the dueling narratives that have defined the case from the beginning. Brown was shot at least six times, all to the front of his body, according to the preliminary results. Four bullets went into his right arm, and he was shot twice in the head. Daryl Parks, an attorney representing Michael Brown's family, said at a news conference in Ferguson, Missouri, on Monday that there is ""ample"" evidence from an independent autopsy conducted on the teen's body to support the arrest of the police officer who shot Brown. ""Already based on this limited information, people believe it plays into whatever theory they have about what happened,"" CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter said. ""Because these shots were all in the front apparently, that might lend credence to people's theories that Michael Brown was going after the police officer. ""On the other hand,"" Stelter added, ""the shots were on the arms (and head) on the front. Does that mean his arms were up?"" It's a case, he said, where more information is not necessarily better information. Therein lies some of the risk. ""This is bound to escalate tensions,"" the Rev. Jesse Jackson said. ""This is a very provocative report."" Accounts unclear . Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot dead nine days ago by a white police officer. His mother asked independent investigators who conducted the autopsy on her son's body whether he felt any pain at the time of his death, according to Brown family attorney Benjamin Crump. She was told that ""he did not suffer,"" Crump said at Monday's news conference. Accounts of exactly what happened when Officer Darren Wilson stopped Brown vary widely. Witnesses said they saw a scuffle between the officer and Brown at the police car before the young man was shot. Police said Brown struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon. Several witnesses said Brown raised his hands and was not attacking the officer. Last week, the St. Louis County Police Department said an original autopsy found that Brown, 18, died of gunshot wounds. But the department wouldn't say how many times he was shot or any other details. ""We are not specifying how many gunshot wounds at this point,"" the department said. ""The investigation into his death is still ongoing, and the full autopsy is not likely to be released for many weeks because multiple law enforcement agencies are now involved in the investigation."" The lack of information prompted Brown's family to request an independent autopsy. A high-profile pathologist . Enter high-profile forensic pathologist Michael Baden. He has brought his expertise to the stand in a number of closely watched cases. Baden testified in the O.J. Simpson, Phil Spector and Drew Peterson murder trials. He was chairman of the committee of pathologists that investigated the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ""Bringing him in is a very big development,"" CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said. ""The family wants to know what happened. And why should they just rely upon on what the authorities to tell them?"" Not shot at close range . According to Baden's autopsy, the bullets that struck Brown were not fired from close range, as indicated by the absence of gunpowder residue on his body. Some of the bullets left several wounds. One of the bullets shattered his right eye, traveled through his face, exited his jaw and re-entered at his collarbone, according to the autopsy. The last two shots were probably the ones to his head, family attorney Anthony Gray said. One entered the top of his Brown's skull, suggesting that his head was bent forward when he was struck. More work to be done . Baden intends to do much more than just the autopsy. He may ask questions about the officer's gun as well. ""Is there only the police officer's DNA on that gun. Or if there was, in fact, a struggle, is Michael Brown's DNA on that gun as well? That would certainly say a lot about whether a struggle for the gun took place."" Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has approved another autopsy on Brown's body, the Justice Department said. The autopsy will be conducted by a federal medical examiner.

"So, got any ideas for what to do with a used space telescope? NASA hopes to find a new job for its planet-hunting Kepler probe after efforts to restore precision control of the orbiting telescope have failed, the space agency announced Thursday. Kepler has been sidelined since mid-May, after the second of four devices used to aim the spacecraft's telescope gave out. Controllers have been trying to restart at least one of those two devices, known as reaction wheels, since July. ""The wheels are sufficiently damaged that they cannot sustain spacecraft pointing control for any extended period of time,"" Charlie Sobeck, Kepler's deputy project manager, told reporters Thursday afternoon. That means Kepler's original science mission -- the search for Earth-like planets far beyond our solar system -- is over, said Paul Hertz, the head of NASA's astrophysics division. But the space agency is trying to figure out whether it can find other missions that don't require that kind of pinpoint control -- and if so, ""whether that science is compelling enough to justify continued investment in Kepler operations,"" Hertz said. The roughly $600 million mission has so far confirmed 135 planets and identified nearly 3,500 possible planets. It findings have led scientists to believe that most stars in our galaxy have planets circling them. Two of them -- found about 1,200 light-years away -- are considered the best candidates so far for hosting life. Controllers have remained in communication with the craft, which is more than 45 million miles from Earth. And since scientists still have more than two years of data to comb through, NASA doesn't consider the mission over, said Bill Borucki, the project's principal scientist. ""We have all this data we have not yet analyzed, and we expect many, many more discoveries,"" he said. Kepler needs three of its four reaction wheels to tweak the telescope, which is aimed at a sliver of the cosmos around the Northern Hemisphere constellations Cygnus and Lyra. The No. 2 reaction wheel failed in 2012, while the No. 4 unit quit in May. In a series of tests that began in mid-July, controllers got both reaction wheels to turn. In early August, they stopped tests on wheel No. 4 after finding high levels of friction, but continued testing the second until encountering the same problem last week, Sobeck said. Sobeck said the probe can still be aimed using the two remaining reaction wheels, and its thrusters -- just not as finely as it could by reaction wheels alone. The thrusters still have enough fuel remaining to last several years if used carefully, he said. The probe was launched in 2009 and has already surpassed its three-and-a-half-year minimum expected lifespan. Borucki said NASA has asked scientists to propose alternatives within a few weeks. The agency will then decide ""which of these will be practical and which of these we can do for a reasonable cost.""","NASA hopes to find an alternative mission for the planet-hunting probe .

"Smoke stacks and exhaust pipes around the world are blasting greenhouse gas emissions to a new record annual high. They should break 39 billion tons this year. But there's also some good news, a new study published Tuesday said. The rate at which people are polluting the air may be leveling off. In the West, emissions contributing to global warming even dropped last year. The United States pumped 3.7% less carbon dioxide into the air in 2012 than in the previous year; Europe 1.8% less. Globally, greenhouse gases are being emitted at a slower rate this year than they were last year, and in both years the climb in emissions was less intense than in the past decade taken as a whole, said researchers at Britain's East Anglia University. Justices to review greenhouse gas regulation . Drop in the bucket . It's an improvement -- but a drop in the bucket by global emission standards. Greenhouse gases are blowing into the atmosphere at rates 61% higher than they were in 1990, the baseline year for the Kyoto Protocol. The international agreement is designed to decrease emissions contributing to global warming by holding its signees to reduction goals. The vast majority of the world's nations have signed on to it. The United States is not one of them. China is. But the world's largest carbon emitter, which wrested the dubious title from the United States in recent years, pumped 5.9% more into the atmosphere in 2012 than in the previous year. India contributed 7.7% more emissions in 2012. Path to catastrophe . Not only must the increase stop, the researchers said, but industrialized nations must achieve a global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Time is running out to stop the world from reaching a dreading global warming threshold. The world is on a course with current emission levels to reach a rise in global temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius or more and end up in the worst climate change scenario issued by the U.N. panel on climate change. The study includes a carbon atlas, which shows levels of pollution emitted by each nation and their development over the last 50 years. In 2012, the largest contributors of greenhouse gases were China with 27%, the United States with 14% and the European Union with 10%. On an individual basis, China and the EU were at the same level, with 7.7 tons of carbon gas emitted per person and year. Americans still polluted the most by far, with more than 17 tons of carbon gas emitted per person in 2012.

"About four years ago, Paula Broadwell began her Ph.D. dissertation on Gen. David Petraeus' innovative leadership skills. Some of the interviews were done via e-mail. Others were conducted as Broadwell occasionally ran with the physically fit four-star, including one time with Petraeus and his team along the Potomac River in Washington. Broadwell decided to turn that research into a book and go to Afghanistan after Petraeus was tapped in June 2010 to replace Gen. Stanley McChrystal as the top commander in the country. ""We had a relationship before I went there as far as this dissertation was concerned, so it just took it to another level,"" Broadwell told CNN's Brooke Baldwin in February. Petraeus biographer's e-mails led FBI to affair, official says . The relationship between Petraeus and his biographer has become the subject of speculation since he admitted to having an extramarital affair and resigned Friday as CIA director. The affair came to light during an FBI investigation into a complaint that Broadwell was sending harassing e-mails to another woman close to Petraeus, a U.S. official said Saturday. During the investigation, other communications surfaced between Petraeus and Broadwell, a married mother of two, according to the official. The official did not identify the woman who made the initial complaint and did not know the nature of her relationship with Petraeus. The FBI interviewed Petraeus in the course of its inquiry, said the official, who stressed that the CIA director was never the target of the investigation and his communications were never compromised. The official did not know whether Broadwell was interviewed. CNN has not been able to reach Broadwell for comment. Her website was not operating Saturday. Broadwell moved with her husband, Scott, to Charlotte, North Carolina, about three years ago, according to the Charlotte Observer. Broadwell, who attended the U.S. Military Academy and served in the Army Reserves after active duty, quickly became a guest on TV news shows after her book, ""All In: The Education of General David Petraeus,"" was published earlier this year. In several appearances on CNN, Broadwell -- with her background in intelligence and counterterrorism -- was asked about U.S. policy in Afghanistan, the Syrian civil war and Iran's use of nuclear technology. She serves as a research associate at Harvard University's Center for Public Leadership. Read the Petraeus letter . Broadwell told Baldwin that she embedded with Petraeus' staff and troops in the field, sharing their hardships and risks. Broadwell spent months in Afghanistan interviewing Petraeus and others for her book, which she wrote with Vernon Loeb. In January, Broadwell told Jon Stewart of ""The Daily Show"" that Petraeus is tenacious, has a will to win and wants to make a difference. ""He loves serving. He loves to be in the arena,"" she said. Just last week, Broadwell published on the Daily Beast a list of Petraeus' 12 rules for living. ""We all will make mistakes,"" read one rule. ""The key is to recognize and admit them, to learn from them, and to take off the rear-view mirrors -- drive on and avoid making them again."" How Petraeus changed the U.S. military . Broadwell met Petraeus in spring 2006 when he spoke at Harvard, where she was a graduate student, she wrote in the preface to ""All In."" The author told the general about her research interests and he agreed to put her in touch with people studying the same issues. ""I later discovered that he was famous for this type of mentoring and networking, especially with aspiring soldier-scholars,"" Broadwell wrote. In the preface, Broadwell -- who earned varsity letters in cross-country and track -- said she wanted to see whether Petraeus could match her stride when they ran. ""Instead, it became a test for me."" Broadwell's passion for physical fitness extended to her appearance earlier this year on ""The Daily Show."" In an effort to raise money for wounded veterans, she and Stewart engaged in a push-up contest. Stewart and Scott Broadwell faced off against Paula Broadwell. A game, but grimacing, Stewart made it to 38 push-ups. Paula Broadwell, apparently ready to do more, stopped at 60.

"Our everyday concerns -- what's for dinner, what to update on Facebook -- seem small when we consider that there's a whole universe out there where other life may exist. Astronomers now are upping that likelihood, announcing that they've identified a star system with up to seven planets -- three of which could potentially host life -- 22 light-years away. The likelihood that conditions could support life on at least one of those planets, given that there are three terrestrial-mass planets in the habitable zone of one system, is ""tremendous,"" according to at least one scientist. The ""habitable zone"" is the area near a star in which a planet can theoretically hold liquid water. In our own solar system, Venus is close to the inner edge of potential habitability, while Mars is closer to the outer edge. The discovery is the largest number of ""habitable zone"" planets ever found within a single system, said Guillem Anglada-Escude of the University of Gottingen, Germany, who led the team of astronomers. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. The findings are only the latest in a recent string of identifications of planets that may host life. ""As soon as our telescopes and data analysis tools have become sophisticated enough to find them, habitable planets are popping up everywhere,"" said Sara Seager, professor of planetary science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the study. ""It's simply exhilarating to know that potentially habitable planets are ubiquitous."" What are these planets like? The three planets orbit a star called Gliese 667C, part of the triple-star system Gliese 667. They are between four and eight times the mass of the Earth, making them ""super-Earths."" If you were standing on any of the potentially habitable planets in this system, that sun would appear as a bright red star. The other two stars in the system ""would look like a very bright pair of stars providing as much illumination as the full moon on Earth,"" Anglada-Escude said. The planets are likely either rocky or water worlds, meaning they're entirely covered in water. These particular planets also appear to be ""tidally locked,"" meaning the same side of a planet is always facing a star. That means one side of the planet always gets light and the other hemisphere is always in darkness. ""With three terrestrial-mass planets in the habitable zone, the likelihood of one of them actually being habitable is tremendous,"" Seager said. The system also likely consists of two hot planets further in and two cooler planets orbiting further out, although scientists are less certain that the seventh planet exists. Scientists determined these characteristics of the star system using new observations gathered from the W. M. Keck Observatory and the Magellan Telescope, with existing data from the European Southern Observatory's HARPS instrument in Chile. Before, scientists had determined that the star Gliese 667C had three planets with one that could be a candidate for life. The Gliese 667C star is about one-third the mass of our sun with about 2% of its luminosity, meaning it is much fainter. But all three of the potentially habitable planets, and their neighbors in their solar system, lie within the equivalent of the orbit of Mercury, meaning they are much closer to the host star than planets in our solar system. If they orbited our sun, the Gliese 667C planets' surfaces evaporate and burn. But they may be habitable because their sun is so much smaller and dimmer. ""It's an extreme scaled down version of the solar system,"" Anglada-Escude said. Another Earth called a certainty . Scientists said the findings suggest that stars with low mass such as Gliese 667C are the best targets for looking for planets that could host life. About 80% of the stars in the Milky Way are in this category of low mass. It's possible that there are many more of these systems that are packed with potentially habitable planets. How they compare to other habitable planets . The Gliese 667C trio represents candidates for life that are about as good as three announced in April by scientists working with NASA's Kepler satellite. Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f both orbit the same star, Kepler-62, which is slightly cooler and smaller than our sun. The Kepler-62 star, however, is 1,200 light-years away. These two planets are closer to the size of Earth than the third habitable candidate, Kepler 69c. It's less clearly in the habitable zone than the other two, and its sun is 2,700 light-years away from us. That makes Gliese 667C seem like a stone's throw away by comparison, at 22 light years -- but that's still about 129 trillion miles. In the night sky, the system can be found in the Scorpius constellation. The Kepler satellite has been keeping an eye on more than 150,000 stars much further away, but on May 15, NASA announced that a reaction wheel -- a part that helps aim the spacecraft -- stopped working. The most recent update, from June 7, says the spacecraft is in Point Rest State, after a second wheel was unable to preserve fuel for an eventual recovery effort. Immediate safety is not as issue, and a team is going to manage the wheel recovery efforts. The Kepler space telescope, launched in 2009, allows scientists to measure changes in brightness of individual stars over time; these dimming events signal that a planet is nearby. Scientists undertake sophisticated calculations to verify that such signals are planets and not passing rocks. ""Scientists undertake sophisticated calculations to verify that such signals are planets and not astrophysical phenomena mimicking the signature of a planet,"" Anglada-Escude said. By contrast, scientists who worked on the Gliese 667C system used the radial velocity method. With this, scientists look for wobbles in the motion of a star, which happens in response to the gravity of nearby planets. How about all of those other planets that have been found previously to be in the habitable zone? You may recall planet Kepler-22b, which was announced in December 2011 and also was hailed as a potential candidate for hosting life. That planet had a radius 2.4 times that of Earth and is 600 light-years away. There is also a planet called Gliese-581g, discovered in September 2010, which is thought to be even more like Earth than Kepler-22b in terms of its suitability for plants and animals. It's only 20 light years from Earth, though there has been some controversy about its existence. In its solar system there is another planet, Gliese-581d, that is also of interest in the search for life, according to the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. The group's catalog lists a few other candidates. But do they really have life? Because they are so far away, the composition of the atmospheres of all of these planets outside our solar system remains unknown. Whether life truly roams or swims out there is still to be seen. ""Whether the planets are actually habitable would be pure speculation,"" Seager said. ""There's currently no way to observe surface liquid water (our habitability requirement) or even infer the presence of surface liquid water."" Still, Anglada-Escude says the existence of star systems packed with potentially habitable planets, and the diversity of planets that Kepler has found, suggest there are more exciting discoveries yet to come.

"Achilles' heel was his weak spot in the Greek myth, but the heel of a newly discovered primate provides a strong connection between humans and their possible ancestors. Scientists have discovered the oldest primate skeleton to date, from a creature that resembles humans' evolutionary line -- the anthropoids -- and a different primate lineage called the tarsiers. They have named this specimen Archicebus achilles, making reference to its heel bone, which resembles those of modern monkeys. Anthropoids include humans, apes and monkeys. Tarsiers are nocturnal primates that live only in Southeast Asia today. The study is published in the journal Nature. ""For the first time, it really shines a light on an important phase of primate and human evolution that we just had very little information about before,"" said K. Christopher Beard, paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and senior author of the study. The specimen's completeness, age and position in the primate family tree make it special, said Erik Seiffert, associate professor at Stony Brook University, who was not involved in the study. Giant extinct lizard named for Jim Morrison . ""In my opinion, it is one of the most important discoveries in the history of paleoprimatology,"" Seiffert said in an e-mail. While fragments of other ancient primates have been found in the past, this skeleton -- about 55 million years old -- is by far the most complete example of a primate from this period, Beard said. Archicebus achilles represents a never-before-seen link between the anthropoids and the tarsiers, Beard said, but he expects the creature's exact position on the evolutionary tree to be quite controversial. Some of its features suggest to his group that it is slightly more closely related to tarsiers than to anthropoids, but other scientists may reach different conclusions. Still, he said, it seems to be clearly related to both groups. ""Archicebus (achilles) gives us our first really detailed look at a species that branched off right near the base of the primate family tree -- when anthropoids, tarsiers, and lemurs had just started out on their separate evolutionary pathways,"" Seiffert said. This creature was tiny -- only 2.8 inches long -- and weighed no more than 1 ounce, making it between the size of a shrew and a mouse. Will mammoths be brought back to life? Liquid blood fuels cloning hopes . Scientists find the small size fascinating because until about a decade ago, researchers believed that anthropoids needed to be a lot bigger, Beard said. But there are counterexamples, even today: The pygmy mouse lemur, found in Madagascar, weighs only about an ounce as well. A creature so tiny must have been ""active and frenetic,"" Beard said. Shrews, for instance, act anxious because they are always looking for their next meal, since they need a lot of food for their high metabolic rate. Archicebus achilles, being small, probably also had a high metabolism, and likely ate high-calorie foods such as insects and very ripe fruits with lots of sugar content. ""When you're that small, you can't afford to eat salad,"" Beard said. ""You can't ingest enough calories rapidly enough to keep your body going."" Unlike modern tarsiers, Archicebus achilles was active during the day. Tarsiers also tend to have eyeballs that are the same volume as their brains, whereas this ancient creature had relatively small eye sockets compared to its face -- an attribute of monkeys. Triceratops trio unearthed in Wyoming . The creature's foot made a big impression on Beard because of how much it resembles the feet of modern-day marmosets. Its features are much more like those of a monkey than a tarsier. On the other hand, other features -- the hip, knee, elbow and pelvis -- more closely resemble a tarsier. Paleontologists can't say that this specific creature is the ancestor of humans and tarsiers, but this is the best approximation so far of something resembling a hypothetical common ancestor, he said. Archicebus achilles was discovered in an ancient lake in Hubei province, China, at a site called the lower Eocene Yangxi Formation, in the Jingzhou area. The scientists plan on going back and looking for more, but it's hard work. They were lucky to have found this creature, Beard said. It must have died near the lake and then its carcass was swept into the lake, perhaps by a stream. The body settled at the bottom, covered up by mud which then hardened. For researchers digging at this site, ancient fish fossils are far more likely to turn up than primates, ""which is cool -- fossil fish are cool. I like fossil fish, but I'm not an expert on fossil fish,"" Beard added. But if you're looking for ancient mammals at this site, ""you have to have an incredible amount of patience because it's probably going to be years before you find something that's really, really exciting. But when you do, you hit the jackpot."" More space and science news from CNN Light Years . Follow @CNNLightYears on Twitter .","Scientists have discovered ancient primate Archicebus achilles .

"Curious about life on Mars? NASA's rover Curiosity has now given scientists the strongest evidence to date that the environment on the Red Planet could have supported life billions of years ago. Since Curiosity made its rock star landing more than a year ago at Gale Crater, the focal point of its mission, the roving laboratory has collected evidence that gives new insights into Mars' past environment. NASA scientists announced in March that Mars could have once hosted life -- at least, in the distant past, based on the chemical analysis of powder collected from Curiosity's drill. An area of the crater known as Yellowknife Bay once hosted ""slightly salty liquid water,"" Michael Meyer, lead scientist for the Mars Exploration Program at NASA headquarters in Washington, said earlier this year. Six new studies released Monday by the journal Science add more insights about these formerly habitable conditions and provide other new knowledge that increase our understanding of the Red Planet. The results were also presented at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. Curiosity found evidence of clay formations, or ""mudstone,"" in Yellowknife Bay, scientists said Monday. Martian mud is a big deal because this clay may have held the key ingredients for life billions of years ago. It means a lake must have existed in this area. ""This is a game changer since these are the kind of materials that are very 'Earth-like' and conducive for life,"" said Douglas Ming, lead author of one of the new studies. This ancient environment, where the clay minerals formed, would have been favorable to microbes, Ming told CNN. Some bacteria on Earth called chemolithoautotrophs could have lived in that kind of environment. These bacteria derive their energy from breaking down rocks and sediments, Ming said, generally by oxidizing elements in the rock. Ming and colleagues also found hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus in the sedimentary rocks at Yellowknife Bay, elements that are all critical for life. The new findings mean the rover's $2.5 billion mission is ""turning the corner,"" said John Grotzinger, a California Institute of Technology planetary geologist and chief scientist for Curiosity, also known as the Mars Science Laboratory. Grotzinger and colleagues found the habitable environment existed later in Martian history than previously thought. By studying physical characteristics of rock layers in and near Yellowknife Bay, they determined that Mars was habitable less than 4 billion years ago -- about the same time as the oldest signs we have for life on Earth. The habitable conditions could have remained for millions to tens of millions of years, with rivers and lakes appearing and disappearing over time. Curiosity also helped scientists figure out the age of an ancient Martian rock, as described in the new research. The rock is called Cumberland, and it now has the distinction of being the first whose age was measured on another planet through chemical analysis. The rover used a method for dating Earth rocks that measures the decay of an isotope of potassium as it slowly changes into argon. Scientists determined the rock was between 3.86 billion and 4.56 billion years old. This age range is consistent with earlier estimates for rocks in Gale Crater. Scientists say roughly 4 billion years ago, the environment on Mars wasn't much different from that of modern-day Earth. But things on Mars then took a drastic turn, and the planet was dramatically transformed from warm and wet to bitterly cold and dry, scientists say. In addition to the cold and dry conditions, scientists say the No. 1 reason life probably wouldn't have thrived on Mars is its extremely high levels of radiation. Studies: Martian atmosphere was destroyed long ago . ""The radiation environment on Mars is unlike anything we have on Earth,"" said Jennifer Eigenbrode, a biogeochemist and geologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and an author of one of the studies. ""We don't know if life on Mars could have ever adapted to the high levels of radiation the surface is currently experiencing."" Eigenbrode added, ""This is a wide-open book, which we have barely started writing the pages of."" New radiation measurements will also be important to planning any human missions to Mars, scientists said. ""Our measurements also tie into Curiosity's investigations about habitability,"" study co-author Don Hassler of Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said in a statement. ""The radiation sources that are concerns for human health also affect microbial survival as well as preservation of organic chemicals."" Organic chemicals come from a variety of sources, including meteorites and comets, but they can also be indicative of life. What's bad for us is bad for signs of life -- but these organic chemicals could still be hiding on Mars nonetheless.

"One man. One woman. Five hundred and one days in an RV-size space capsule. Will they still be speaking when they return? The Inspiration Mars Foundation is seeking to send two people -- potentially a middle-aged married couple -- to space in a capsule that would pass within 100 miles of Mars. Although no formal application process has begun, the Mars mission masterminds are already receiving résumés and technology ideas from interested people, said Jane Poynter, president of Paragon Space Development Corp., which is developing technologies for the mission that's hoping to launch in 2018. More about the mission . Whether the money to finance the Mars mission materializes remains to be seen, but if it does happen: Who would these space adventurers be, and how would they cope? It's never been tried before, so really, no one knows. Who should go? A rigorous process will be put in place for selecting the crew, Poynter said. A man and a woman are sought for the roles to ""represent humanity,"" she said; a married couple is ""preferred"" but not required. ""You want to make sure that you start out with a relationship between the two people that go on this mission that is on really solid footing, that they know how to pick themselves up after a falling-out,"" Poynter said. Poynter said she and husband Taber MacCallum, CEO of Paragon, are ""intrigued"" by the idea of being the pioneers to go on the mission. They have experience in close quarters, having spent two years with six other people sealed inside Biosphere 2, a research facility situated on a little over 3 acres in Arizona, in the early 1990s. ""It's always helpful to have somebody help buoy you in difficult times and problem-solve with and to share the marvelous moments with as well,"" she said of living there with her husband. ""I think it really helped us be productive crew members."" Friends who have known each other for decades, or siblings who get along well and are comfortable spending long periods of time with one another, would also be suitable for this sort of situation, said Jason Kring, assistant professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, who is not involved with the mission. But there is some evidence from extreme environments on Earth to support the married couple idea, says Lawrence Palinkas of the University of Southern California, who has studied more than 1,000 Americans who have spent winters in Antarctica over a four-decade period. Based on Palinkas' studies at the South Pole, the most stable individuals and those with the most stable relationships are middle-aged married couples. That works out well for space travel, given that older people have less time left in their lives for space radiation to potentially cause cancer, Kring said. Radiation is also associated with infertility, so the couple should not be seeking to have children after the mission. Prolonged separation from family and friends back home is a huge source of stress for people in isolated, confined environments, Palinkas said. Having a close confidant in space would allow them to share their day-to-day experiences with someone they love and trust. NASA astronaut Cady Coleman, who has logged more than 4,330 hours in space, agreed: ""Often, work that is as demanding as ours in terms of time away from family.  think it might be great to be able to spend that kind of time with your sweetheart."" Will two people get along? Of course, the behavioral quirks and annoyances that you might easily brush aside on Earth would be magnified in a confined space over 501 days. Even in a healthy marital relationship, there can be such a thing as too much contact, Palinkas said. Nobody really knows the ideal size of a crew to travel this long, but Peter Suedfeld, professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia, is skeptical about having just two people. If one of them is emotionally unavailable, the other is out of luck. (As for whether sex has ever been tried in space, ""there are rumors but no official acknowledgment,"" Suedfeld said.) ""When both of you are under stress -- and these two people would be under the same level of stress, the same kind of stress -- each of them would want emotional support and be too focused on their own problems to give it to the other,"" Suedfeld said. In his view, it's better to have a team with some amount of diversity, where no one background or nationality predominates. The International Space Station usually has a crew of six these days, and that's worked out well, he said. There are other challenges: If one person were to get sick, the remaining crew member would need to take over all tasks to keep the vehicle operational, Kring said. In Biosphere 2, which is much bigger than a space capsule, Poynter and MacCallum never got on each other's nerves, she said; it was others who irked them, so the couple could ""rally together."" But whether any given couple who goes to Mars would still want to be together after 501 days is anyone's guess, experts say. Psychological difficulties . Scientists do not have data from actual missions to Mars, but situations of isolation and confinement on Earth give us some clues as to how things might go. In the Mars500 experiment, a collaboration between the Russian, European and Chinese space agencies, a crew of six men was locked in a chamber near Moscow for 520 days to simulate a Mars trip. The crew received no fresh food or fresh air and could not see the sun. A recent study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that most crew members experienced sleep disturbances of some kind but found a trend toward increased sleep and rest as the mission went on. One crew member appeared to live on a 25-hour day instead of 24. Researchers also noted ""behavioral aspects of torpor"" in the crew, akin to hibernation of some birds and animals. In his Antarctica studies, Palinkas and colleagues found that in a psychologically healthy group, about 5% of people experience clinically significant psychological symptoms. These include depression, anxiety, substance abuse problems, sleep disorders and adjustment disorders relating to not getting along with crewmates. However, most people do well, he said, and see a lot of benefit from participating in the experience -- ""definitely an increase in feelings of self-confidence, self-efficacy -- the belief that if they can handle this, they can pretty much handle anything."" In Biosphere 2, where Poynter's days involved pruning shears, plants and a two-way radio, the crew of eight didn't exactly live in psychological peace. Poynter remembers standing in the sweet potato field one day, and ""it was like a time portal opened."" In her mind, she was a child again, having an argument with one of her brothers. Such vivid flashbacks have also occurred to people living in Antarctica, she said. The Biosphere 2 group eventually sought and received psychological counseling via telephone. Bored, bored and bored 40 minutes later? ""We've got to select for people that can maintain upbeat and happy attitude in the face of adversity and that are resilient,"" Poynter said. Aboard the International Space Station, astronauts often enjoy just gazing out the window at Earth from afar. Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield has a popular Twitter account that he uses to post extraordinary photos of the planet. But a couple en route to Mars would see Earth shrink until it's a dot among many others in the lonely sky. ""There's going to be, I'm quite sure, a feeling of separation that no one has experienced before,"" Suedfeld said. Don't forget the communication delay. A message may take as long as 40 minutes to travel to Earth and back, and there may be times when communication with the ground is not possible at all. If a crew member is having a breakdown and someone on Earth is trying to counsel him or her, Kring says, it will take 20 minutes for a message such as ""try to think calming thoughts"" to reach the spacefarer and another 20 minutes for an acknowledgment to get back to Earth. One solution to the boredom question could be time-release entertainment packages, Suedfeld said. In other words, some movies or music will not become ""unlocked"" until a given amount of time has passed so that the couple doesn't blow through all of their entertainment at once. Poynter said the Biosphere 2 crew created music using the sounds from the animals and machinery in the biosphere. Music-making or reading would be options on the Mars journey, too, she said. Eventually, presumably, Mars would come into view. ""To look down on Mars and be the first people to see, potentially, our future home planet --"" Poynter interrupted herself to let out a high-pitched ""Oooo!"" -- ""gives me chills just thinking about it."" ... And other health issues . Besides mental factors, gravity differences in space present a slew of physiological challenges that aren't easily simulated on Earth over long periods of time. There's evidence that the visual system can be impaired, and the weakening of bones and muscle may occur, Kring said. How the two people aboard the space capsule would deal with these sorts of issues, on top of mental stress, remains to be seen -- as does whether the mission will actually launch as envisioned in January 2018. ""I'm all for supporting this, and I certainly am a big proponent of human spaceflight, but I wonder if all of this can be figured out in five years,"" Kring said.

"A  bourbon heist at a high-end Kentucky distillery has left tongues wagging in elite whiskey circles and some small-town cops wondering whodunit. The Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort noticed this week that it was missing some of its 20-year-old Pappy Van Winkle, one of the rarest and most sought after bourbons in the world. ""It's highly coveted,""  said Franklin County Sheriff Pat Melton, the man leading the investigation. ""It's the best of the best."" Melton said the distillery called him on Tuesday to report that 65 cases, or 195 bottles, of the high-end hard stuff were unaccounted for. Nine cases of Pappy Van Winkle rye were also missing. ""We believe whoever did this took them out the back from the secured area over a period of two months"" Melton said. ""Obviously, the way this happened, it's indicative of an inside job."" Buffalo Trace did not respond to requests for comment, but Melton said the distillery employs about 50 people and operates two shifts. Just how coveted is Pappy Van Winkle? While the listed retail price is $130 per bottle, the bourbon is so rare that consumers usually end up paying much more to get a bottle, if they can find one, said Tom Fischer of bourbonblog.com. ""There is a lot of mystery around how to even get one,"" he said. One place to get one is online retailer dukeofbourbon.com, where a bottle of 20-year-old Pappy Van Winkle costs $1,199. ""It's the pinnacle of bourbon,"" gushed Fischer. ""If you're around a bottle, it's a special occasion."" Melton said officials are in the early stages of the investigation, and will be on the lookout for any bottles popping up on the black market. But the thief might not be in any rush, Fischer said. ""If you keep bourbon in the right conditions, it will be good forever."" ""You have to wonder what's going to happen to the 195 stolen bottles,"" said Kit Codik, CEO of the all-things cocktail website Liquor.com.

"The meteor that exploded over the steppes of southwestern Russia sent a low-frequency rumble bouncing through the Earth, giving scientists new clues about the biggest cosmic intruder in a century. The big boom over Chelyabinsk on February 15 also produced a wave of sound thousands of times lower than a piano's middle C -- far below the range of human hearing, according to the international agency that watches for nuclear bomb tests. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization said that sound wave showed up on sensors from Greenland to Antarctica, making it the largest ever detected by its network. Scientists then used that wave to calculate the size of the small asteroid that plunged to Earth, said Margaret Campbell-Brown, an astronomer at Canada's University of Western Ontario. The duration of the wave -- about 32 seconds -- let scientists estimate the energy of the blast at between 450 and 500 kilotons, the size of about 30 early nuclear bombs . From there, Brown said, they could calculate the size of the fireball; and using an estimate of the meteor's speed from the numerous dashboard and mobile-phone cameras that captured the scene, it was ""first-year physics"" to figure out the approximate size and weight, she said. The latest estimate is that the Chelyabinsk meteor was about 56 feet (17 meters) across, weighed more than 7,000 tons and was moving about 18 kilometers per second (40,000 mph) when it blew apart, she said. Opinion: A meteor and asteroid: 1 in 100 million odds . ""In terms of things we have observed, this is the largest since Tunguska,"" Brown said, referring to the suspected meteor that flattened a Siberian forest in 1908. The nuclear test monitors pick up ""infrasound"", or low frequency, waves from about 20 meteors a year -- ""if conditions are right, perhaps as small as a pea,"" she said. Russian authorities say more than 1,500 people were hurt, mostly by flying glass, when the Chelyabinsk meteor exploded in spectacular fashion. Amateur video footage showed a bright white streak moving rapidly across the sky before exploding with an even brighter flash and a deafening bang. Bill Cooke, head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office, said scientists believe the object originated in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It was the Apollo group of asteroids, which circle the sun in oblong orbits, that occasionally cross Earth's. Cooke said scientists expect to study the Chelyabinsk event for months. But the dozens of fragments that have been found so far point to a fairly common, stony asteroid with traces of nickel and iron. ""The composition is not at all unusual as far as meteorites go,"" he said. ""It was just very big.""

"Don't consider this a count-down to doomsday, but on February 15 an asteroid is going to come pretty close to Earth. And this is only one of thousands of objects that are destined to one day enter our neighborhood in space. ""There are lots of asteroids that we're watching that we haven't yet ruled out an Earth impact, but all of them have an impact probability that is very, very low,"" Don Yeomans, manager of the Near-Earth Object Program Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said at a press briefing. This particular asteroid is called 2012 DA14. NASA scientists reiterated Thursday that people have nothing to worry about. ""No Earth impact is possible,"" Yeomans said. The asteroid is thought to be 45 meters -- about half a football field -- long. It will come no closer than 17,100 miles from our planet's surface. What would happen if the asteroid hit . An object the size of 2012 DA14 appears to hit Earth about once every 1,200 years, Yeomans said. ""There really hasn't been a close approach that we know about for an object of this size,"" Yeomans said. On its close approach to Earth, the asteroid will be traveling at 7.8 kilometers per second, roughly eight times the speed of a bullet from a high-speed rifle, he said. If it were to hit our planet -- which is, again, impossible -- it would collide with the energy of 2.4 megatons of TNT, Yeomans said. This is comparable to the event in Tunguska, Russia, in 1908. That asteroid entered the atmosphere and exploded, leveling trees over an area of 820 square miles -- about two-thirds the size of Rhode Island. Like that rock, 2012 DA14 would likely not leave a crater. Here's a comforting thought: Meteorites enter the Earth's atmosphere all the time. About 100 tons of rocks come in from space every day, Yeomans said. They are mostly small, from the size of a grain of sand to the size of a human fist. If you have a telescope at least a few inches in diameter, you would see it as a small point of light moving across the sky, said Timothy Spahr, director of the Minor Planet Center at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. You'll have to be located in Eastern Europe, Asia or Australia for the best telescope-aided view, scientists said. It won't be visible to the naked eye. More on the February 15 asteroid approach . What else is out there? So, we know that this particular asteroid isn't going to hit us, but how about all of those other giant rocks floating nearby beyond our atmosphere? NASA says 9,672 objects have been classified as Near Earth Objects, or NEOs, as of February 5. Near Earth Objects are comets or asteroids in orbits that allow them to enter Earth's neighborhood. There's an important distinction between these objects: Comets are mostly water, ice and dust, while asteroids are mostly rock or metal. Both comets and asteroids have hit Earth in the past. More than 1,300 Near Earth Objects have been classified as potentially hazardous to Earth, meaning that someday, they may come close or hit Earth. NASA is monitoring these objects and updating their locations as new information comes in. Right now, scientists aren't warning of any imminent threats. Yeomans and colleagues are using telescopes on the ground and in space to nail down the precise orbit of objects that might threaten Earth and predict whether the planet could be hit. Observatories around the world send their findings to the NASA-funded Minor Planet Center, which keeps a database of all known asteroids and comets in our solar system. NASA also has a space probe tracking asteroids to learn more about them. The Dawn probe was launched in 2007 and has already sent back dramatic pictures from the giant asteroid Vesta. The spacecraft is now heading to the dwarf planet Ceres. Vesta and Ceres are the two most massive objects in the main asteroid belt. A new asteroid adventure in 2016 . A mission that's scheduled to launch in 2016 will teach scientists even more about asteroids. OSIRIS-REx will visit an asteroid called 1999 RQ36, take a sample of at least 2.1 ounces and bring it back to Earth. ""This is going to be the largest sample of an extraterrestrial object returned to Earth since end of the Apollo missions over 40 years ago,"" said Edward Beshore, deputy principal investigator for the mission, who is based at the University of Arizona, Tucson. The probe will arrive at the asteroid in 2018, study it, then bring back the sample in 2023. 1999 RQ36 is made of materials ""almost identical to those that were present when the solar system was formed about 4.5 billion years ago,"" he said. That means studying this asteroid could yield greater understanding about the sources of organic molecules and water that gave rise to life. This asteroid, like the one that will fly by on February 15, is considered a near-Earth object. The mission would further clarify the threat that this particular object poses, and better predict the orbits of other near-Earth asteroids, Beshore said. Scientists at the University of Arizona are collaborating with NASA and Lockheed Martin Space Systems on this mission. To better predict the orbits of hazardous objects, this group is looking at the Yarkovsky effect, a force created when the asteroid absorbs sunlight and re-radiates it as heat. The effect is, at first glance, quite small -- Beshore cited his colleague Steven Chesley's comparison of this effect to the force you feel when you hold grapes in your hand. But over time, it's an important consideration when trying to understand where an asteroid is headed. ""That force, applied over millions of years, can literally move mountains of rock around,"" Beshore said. We can't say this enough: Don't panic over it.

"China sent fighter jets into its newly claimed air defense zone Thursday, as Japan and South Korea sounded notes of defiance by declaring they would continue to fly through disputed airspace without notifying Beijing. South Korea announced yesterday it had already sent a military flight into China's newly claimed ""air defense identification zone"" (ADIZ) on Tuesday without alerting China, while Japan appeared to claim it had also flown into the territory since China's announcement Saturday that it was unilaterally establishing the zone. The flights have raised the stakes in a rapidly escalating dispute over contested territory in and above the East China Sea. They follow U.S. flights into the territory earlier in the week, when two unarmed B-52 bombers passed uncontested through the zone, in what the Pentagon described as a pre-planned military exercise. Col. Shen Jinke, spokesman for the People's Liberation Army Air Force, said the Chinese warplanes, including Su-30 and J-11 fighters and an airborne radar early warning system, were flown Thursday into the ADIZ in what he described as a ""defensive measure ... in line with international practices."" The fighter jets conducted ""routine air patrols ... aiming to strengthen monitoring on air targets in the zone and fulfill the air force's historic mission,"" Shen said in a statement posted on the Chinese Defense Ministry's website. China's military has been on ""high alert,"" he added, and was prepared to act ""based on different air threats to firmly ensure air-defense safety."" OPINION: Beijing's foreign policy balancing act in the East China Sea . An ADIZ is a unilaterally imposed buffer zone outside a country's sovereign airspace, with scant recognition in international law, in which foreign aircraft can be requested to provide identification for entry into that country's airspace. China's newly claimed ADIZ overlaps similar zones claimed by neighboring countries, including over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, which have been at the center of a festering territorial dispute between Beijing and Tokyo. Meanwhile, South Korea announced yesterday its military had flown into the area Tuesday on a routine patrol flight without notifying China. A Defense Ministry official said the flights -- over a disputed submerged rock in the Yellow Sea, known by Korea as Ieodo and by China as Suyan -- were regularly carried out twice a week, and would continue despite China's ADIZ declaration. The spokesman said South Korean officials asked Beijing at a meeting Thursday to amend the boundaries of the new ADIZ so that there was no overlap with South Korea's ADIZ, a request that China had rejected. Seoul responded by saying it was considering expanding its ADIZ to protect its national interest, according to the official. Japan also signaled its rejection of Beijing's move Thursday, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga telling reporters his country's Self Defense Force had been continuing surveillance patrols of disputed territory in the East China Sea just as it had before China's declaration. ""We have no intention to change this operation out of consideration for China,"" said Suga. ""We will continue the surveillance/patrol operation with strong determination to protect our territory against China's one-sided attempt to change the status quo by force."" Read more: Why China's new air defense zone has incensed neighbors . China has grown more assertive beyond its recognized borders since Chinese President Xi Jinping took office in March this year -- creating a delicate situation for Washington, which has promised to focus more on Asia and uphold commitments to its allies in the region. ""Unlike his predecessors, Xi is making foreign policy with the mindset of a great power, increasingly probing U.S. commitments to its allies in the region and exploiting opportunities to change the status quo,"" Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, director of Asia-Pacific programs at the U.S. Institute of Peace, wrote in a commentary for CNN.com this week. The United States and Japan have criticized Beijing's air defense claim, saying it escalates tensions in the region and raises the risk of an incident. China hit back at those comments, describing the U.S. and Japanese statements as unreasonable and unacceptable, and saying Japan should first repeal its own zone, claimed more than 40 years ago. But in statements Thursday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang appeared to soften demands that commercial airliners passing through the airspace notify Chinese authorities, saying the zone was not targeted at ""normal"" flights by international airliners. However, he hoped that airlines would cooperate with authorities, by providing flight plans and responding to radio requests for identification, as he said many airlines have begun to do. Two major Japanese airlines have already refused to comply with the request.","Official: China warplanes fly as ""defensive measure"" into newly declared zone .

"The Higgs boson, or the ""God particle,"" which was discovered last year, garnered two physicists the Nobel Prize in physics on Tuesday, but it didn't go to the scientists who detected it. Nearly 50 years ago, Francois Englert of Belgium and Peter Higgs of the United Kingdom had the foresight to predict that the particle existed. Now, the octogenarian pair share the Nobel Prize in physics in recognition of a theoretical brilliance that was vindicated by the particle's discovery last year. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the prize to them. Higgs and Englert's theories behind the elusive Higgs boson explained what gives matter its mass. The universe is filled with Higgs bosons. As atoms and parts of atoms zoom around, they interact with and attract Higgs bosons, which cluster around them in varying numbers. Certain particles will attract larger clusters of Higgs bosons, and the more of them a particle attracts, the greater its mass will be. The explanation helped complete scientists' understanding of the nature of all matter. ""The awarded theory is a central part of the Standard Model of particle physics that describes how the world is constructed,"" the Royal Swedish Academy said in a post on Twitter. As is tradition, the academy phoned the scientists during the announcement to inform them of their win. They were unable to reach Higgs, for whom the particle is named. The conversation with Englert was short and sweet.  ""I feel very well, of course,"" he said, when he heard the news. ""Now, I'm very happy."" What is the Higgs boson and why is it important? The discoverers . When the Nobel announcement came down, the Higgs boson's discoverers in Geneva, Switzerland, broke out the champagne, said lead physicist Joe Incandela. ""The place erupted into applause."" There must have been over 100 people in the room at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, he said. Many of them were American scientists. About one quarter of the physicists involved in the discovery came from the United States. The researchers felt equally recognized alongside the Nobel recipients. They were not expecting to receive the prize themselves. That would have been atypical. It goes more often to those involved on the theoretical side and not on the experimental side, Incandela said. But it didn't matter. ""We're extremely happy with that,"" he said. ""I'm elated. We feel that we've been recognized."" The fact that the prize was awarded to the theorists so soon after the particle's existence was detected by experimenters is a confirmation of the value of their contribution, Incandela said. The discovery . The July 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson in the most powerful particle accelerator in the world, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, has been billed as one of the biggest scientific achievements of the past 50 years. But the Royal Academy passed over the Higgs boson last year, to the surprise of many. The scientists, in the meantime, have confirmed their discovery and solidified its place in science. On March 14, what would have been Albert Einstein's birthday, they announced that, over time, the particle they found looked even more like the Higgs boson they had been chasing for almost 50 years. It was a landmark scientific advancement, and it was a first. Many scientists dislike the term ""God particle,"" even though it's become popular in the media. The nickname came from the title of a book by Leon Lederman, who reportedly wanted to call it the ""Goddamn Particle"" since it was so hard to find. The Nobel Prize in physics makes a nice lifetime achievement award for Englert and Higgs. Both are professors emeritus: Englert at the Free University of Brussels; Higgs at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Though deserving, they are lucky, as the Royal Academy had a long list of brilliant scientists and achievements to choose from. And the field of physics covers a virtually infinite scale, from beyond the smallest sub-atomic particles to the largest, most distant stars and quasars in the vast reaches of the universe. Last year's winners . Last year's prize to Serge Haroche and David J. Wineland rewarded work in the field of quantum optics. It could lead the way to superfast computers and and the most precise clocks ever seen. The two approached the same principles from opposite directions. The American used light particles to measure the properties of matter, while his French colleague focused on tracking light particles by using atoms. Both Nobel laureates found ways to isolate the subatomic particles and keep their properties intact at the same time. Prior to the breakthrough, such particles quickly interacted with matter, which changed their qualities and rendered them unobservable. That left scientists stuck doing a lot of guesswork. Past and future Nobels . Since 1901, the committee has handed out the Nobel Prize in physics 107 times, including this year's award. The youngest recipient was Lawrence Bragg, who won in 1915 at the age of 25. Bragg is not only the youngest physics laureate; he is also the youngest laureate in any Nobel Prize area. The oldest physics laureate was Raymond Davis Jr., who was 88 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2002. John Bardeen was the only physicist to receive the prize twice, for work in semiconductors and superconductivity. Two Americans and a German shared the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine this year. Americans James E. Rothman and Randy W. Schekman and German Thomas C. Sudhof were awarded the prize Monday for discoveries of how the body's cells decide when and where to deliver the molecules they produce. Disruptions of this delivery system contribute to diabetes, neurological diseases and immunological disorders. In the coming days, prize committees will announce the laureates in chemistry, literature, peace and economics. Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel created the prizes in 1895 to honor work in physics, chemistry, literature and peace. The first economics prize was awarded in 1969. Nobel medical prize goes to 2 Americans, 1 German . Follow @CNNLightYears on Twitter for more science news updates .","Francois Englert and Peter Higgs are awarded the Nobel Prize in physics .

"Ten-year-old Nathan Entingh doesn't understand why he got suspended from school for three days. According to his father, Paul Entingh, one moment the boy was ""goofing off"" with his friends in fifth-grade science class, and the next the teacher was taking him out of the classroom, invoking Ohio's zero-tolerance policy. The offense?  Nathan was ""making his fingers look like a gun, having the thumb up and the pointed finger sticking out,"" said Entingh, describing the February 26 incident. ""He was pointing it at a friend's head and he said 'boom.' The kid didn't see it. No other kids saw it. But the teacher saw it,"" he said. ""It wasn't threatening. It wasn't hostile. It was a 10-year-old kid playing."" The next morning Paul Entingh escorted his son Nathan to the principal's office, where they met with Devonshire Alternative Elementary School Principal Patricia Price. ""She said if it happened again the suspension would be longer, if not permanent,"" said Entingh, who also received a letter explaining the reason for Nathan's suspension as a ""level 2 look alike firearm."" The letter, which Entingh shared with CNN, read, ""Nathan put his fingers up to another student's head, simulating a gun, and said, 'BOOM,' "" Price's office referred CNN's call to Columbus City Schools spokesman Jeff Warner. Price ""has been warning the students for some weeks,"" said Warner. ""We've had a problem at this school. The boys have gone around fake shooting and making paper guns at class. It's inappropriate. She has sent notes to parents for the past three weeks alerting them of the problem."" Entingh said he never received a notice, but was aware of school authorities telling students, including Nathan, that any gun-related behavior would have serious consequences. ""I don't know if it's to the point it happened so much they needed to punish somebody to set an example. I don't know, it blows my mind,"" said Entingh. Warner acknowledged there was likely no ill-intention in Nathan's actions. ""I know he (Nathan) felt it was funny and in jest, but the teacher felt it was inappropriate given the warnings that were given."" Warner said Nathan wasn't singled out as an example, but that his was the first incident after Price gave ""her final notice last week."" Common sense? Ohio's ""zero-tolerance"" rules in public schools came under attack in January when state Sen. Charleta Tavares introduced bill SB 167 to reverse or reform the original 1998 law introduced as part of SB 55. The 1998 bill mandated schools ""adopt a policy of zero tolerance for violent, disruptive, or inappropriate behavior, including excessive truancy."" SB 55 also called for schools to ""establish strategies to address such behavior that range from prevention to intervention,"" but Tavares believes schools have opted for punishment strategies instead. ""We have moved away from common sense, ensuring that the punishment fits the infraction,"" said Tavares. ""We should maintain the highest form of punishment which is expulsion or suspension to those cases that cause the most harm."" Ohio Department of Education statistics show Nathan isn't alone. According to state disciplinary figures for the 2012-2013 school year, a total of 419 statewide students, from various grade levels, were suspended because of an incident in the category of ""firearm look-a-likes,"" and an additional 38 students were expelled. In the Columbus City Schools district, where Nathan goes to school, 12 students were expelled because of incidents in the ""firearm look-a-likes"" category, while 69 students were suspended. Contrast that with categories such as harassment and intimidation, in which zero students were expelled, though 1527 were suspended districtwide. Tavares has been trying to build consensus for her bill arguing that the current law is outdated because it doesn't take into consideration other factors, such as behavior and mental health. ""The bigger issue is that we need more behavior health and counseling at school so we can look at the root cause of why this child is acting out and being disruptive,"" said Tavares. Entingh agrees and said he is planning to reach out to Tavares. He has struggled to help Nathan make sense of what happened. ""How much of a threat can it really be for a 10-year-old to hold up his fingers?"" said a frustrated Entingh. ""I would like for somebody to explain this to me because apparently I don't get it. This is way over the boundary. A teacher could have talked to him and sat him down, given him detention, but a three days suspension?"" Entingh is the father of five children, including Nathan, and he says none of them have ever gotten in trouble at school. Until now. When asked what has Nathan learned from this incident, Entingh paused, then scoffed: ""He's learned never to make his fingers like a gun a school again. I don't know if you consider that a life lesson.""","10-year-old suspended for making fingers into shape of gun .

"Fragments of humans' ancient relatives are scattered across the globe. Sometimes a tooth or a few bones are all we have to tell us about an entire species closely related to humans that lived thousands or millions of years ago. So when anyone finds a complete skull of a possible human ancestor, paleoanthropologists rejoice. But with new knowledge comes new controversy over a fossil's place in our species' very fuzzy family tree. In the eastern European nation of Georgia, a group of researchers has excavated a 1.8 million-year-old skull of an ancient human relative, whose only name right now is Skull 5. They report their findings in the journal Science, and say it belongs to our genus, called Homo. ""This is most complete early Homo skull ever found in the world,"" said lead study author David Lordkipanidze, researcher at the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi. Skull 5 is the fifth example of a hominid -- a bipedal primate mammal that walked upright -- from this time period found at the site in Dmanisi, Georgia. Stone tools and animal bones have also been recovered from the area. The variation in physical features among the Dmanisi hominid specimens is comparable to the degree of diversity found in humans today, suggesting that they all belong to one species, Lordkipanidze said. But ""if you will put separately all these five skulls and five jaws in different places, maybe people will call it as a different species,"" he said. Now it gets more controversial: Lordkipanidze and colleagues also propose that these individuals are members of a single evolving Homo erectus species, examples of which have been found in Africa and Asia. The similarities between the new skull from Georgia and Homo erectus remains from Java, Indonesia, for example, may mean there was genetic ""continuity across large geographic distances,"" the study said. What's more, the researchers suggest that the fossil record of what have been considered different Homo species from this time period -- such as Homo ergaster, Homo rudolfensis and Homo habilis -- could actually be variations on a single species, Homo erectus. That defies the current understanding of how early human relatives should be classified. Because of Skull 5 and the other Dmanisi fossils, scientists are ""rethinking what happened in Africa,"" Lordkipanidze said. The Dmanisi individuals appear to have long legs and short arms, based on the fossils that have been found, said study co-author Marcia Ponce de Leon, of the Anthropological Institute at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, at a press conference. The braincase of Skull 5 is 546 cubic centimeters, which is smaller than expected. The biggest brain case found at Dmanisi is 75% larger than the smallest one, which is consistent with what is observed in modern humans, said study co-author Christoph Zollikofer of the Anthropological Institute in Zurich. At Dmanisi, researchers believe carnivores and hominids were fighting over animal carcasses. The stone tools appear to have been used in butchering, based on the cut marks on animal bones, Lordkipanidze said. They are comparable to tools that have been found in Africa. ""It's a real snapshot in time,"" Lordkipanidze said of the Dmanisi site. Skull 5, excavated in 2005, was matched to a jaw discovered in 2000. The first example of a hominid fossil at Dmanisi was discovered in 1991. So what species came after Homo erectus in the history of human relatives? Scientists have no idea, Zollikofer said. ""It would be nice to say this is the last common ancestor of Neanderthals and us, but we simply don't know,"" Zollikofer said. The Dmanisi fossils are a great find, say anthropology researchers not involved with the excavation. But they're not sold on the idea that this is the same Homo erectus from both Africa and Asia -- or that individual Homo species from this time period are really all one species. ""The specimen is wonderful and an important contribution to the hominin record in a temporal period where there are woefully too few fossils,"" said Lee Berger, paleoanthropologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, in an e-mail. But the suggestion that these fossils prove an evolving lineage of Homo erectus in Asia and Africa, Berger said, is ""taking the available evidence too far."" Berger led the team that discovered Australopithecus sediba, a possible human ancestor that lived around 2 million years ago in South Africa. He criticized the authors of the new study for not comparing the fossils at Dmanisi to A. sediba or to more recent fossils found in East Africa. Ancient fossils question human family tree . Lordkipanidze said he and colleagues consider A. sediba to be earlier and more primitive than the Dmanisi hominids, and that there's ""no doubt"" the Georgian fossils belong to the Homo genus. But the selectivity of fossils compared to them in this study may have artificially biased the results toward the researchers' hypotheses, Berger said. Ian Tattersall, curator emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History's anthropology division, said in an e-mail that there's ""no way this extraordinarily important specimen is Homo erectus,"" if the skull fragment discovered in Trinil, Java, Indonesia, defines the features of the Homo erectus group. The New York museum's Hall of Human Origins takes visitors on a tour through human evolutionary history, showing distinct Homo species reflected in major fossil finds such as Turkana Boy (Homo ergaster) and Peking man (Homo erectus). The Dmanisi discovery may find a place there too, but it's probably not going to result in relabeling other species, Tattersall said. ""Right now I certainly wouldn't change the Hall -- except to add the specimen, which really is significant,"" he said. There is an area of about 50,000 square meters at Dmanisi still to be excavated, so Skull 5 may have even more company. Ancient creature had spider-like brain .

"(CNN) -- Indian doctors have successfully removed a 1.2-meter rod from a 3-year-old boy after he was impaled on it at his grandparents' house. Indian doctors say Mehul Kumar is out of danger after operation to remove 1.2-meter iron rod. The Times of India reported that Mehul Kumar had fallen on the rod while playing on his grandparents' under-construction roof terrace in Ranchi, the capital city of Jharkhand state. The rod pierced through Kumar's body and he then fell to the ground, the newspaper reported. He was rushed to a nearby hospital and then taken to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences in Bariatu, six kilometers away. Dr. Sandeep Agarwal, the leader of the five-strong team of doctors who spent five hours operation on Kumar, told the Times the boy was out of danger. ""We first removed the rod following which an operation was done to repair the vital organs that had been injured,'' he said.","Indian doctors successfully remove 1.2-meter rod from three-year-old boy .

"Washington (CNN) -- With the first of its flights touching down in earthquake-devastated Haiti late Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. began deploying military planes, ships and ground troops to the Caribbean nation. One of two planes carrying a 30-person assessment team arrived at Port-au-Prince airport about 5:30 p.m. Wednesday. The team will assess what Haiti needs to cope with the immediate aftermath of the disaster. One of the team's first jobs is to get the airport working to a point where it can handle all the flights coming in from around the world filled with people and supplies to help the victims of the quake. The U.S. Southern Command is leading the Department of Defense's response. Gen. P.K. Keen, deputy commander of the Southern Command, was in Haiti when the quake struck and has seen the situation at the airport. ""He says the runway is functional, but the tower doesn't have communications capability. The passenger terminal ... has structural damage to it, so we don't know what the status of it is, "" said Gen. Douglas Fraser, head of U.S. Southern Command. ""So we have a group going in to make sure we can gain and secure the airfield and operate from it, because that's one of those locations we think we're going to have a lot of the immediate effort -- from an international basis -- going into."" The group includes a unit of U.S. Air Force Special Operations Forces that departed Hurlburt Field in Florida on Wednesday afternoon. They include airmen and equipment to set up temporary air traffic control systems as well as search-and-rescue experts. Fraser also has ordered the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson to steam toward Haiti. The ship was at sea near Virginia when the quake hit and as it sails south, it will stop at Mayport, Florida, Naval Station to pick up supplies. The Carl Vinson ""had a very small complement of aircraft on it when it was at sea,"" Fraser told reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday. ""As ... it passes through or by Mayport, we're going to provision it with as much capability as we can, primarily looking at helicopter capacity ... because we need to be able to get around the country."" The carrier is able to provide needed helicopters for lifting aid from the ship into the country as well as moving construction equipment to places where the machines are needed to clear rubble. The U.S. Navy also activated the hospital ship USNS Comfort, based in Baltimore, Maryland, on Wednesday. While the Southern Command has not officially asked for the ship, the Navy activated it proactively expecting it will be requested. The ship takes up to five days to prepare after being notified. It could be ready at the latest by Monday. The ship is staffed by 64 crew and 560 hospital personnel, and when ready it will sail toward Haiti in case it is requested. Southern Command has ordered a unit of about 2,000 Marines to head to Haiti. The Marines will deploy aboard a large deck amphibious ship, which would give the military more helicopters to work with in Haiti. It also has a large medical facility that could help with treating the injured. It's medical facilities are comparable to the facilities aboard the Comfort, and it is possible only one of the two ships would be sent. The Army said a brigade of roughly 3,500 members of the 82nd Airborne Division is on notice that they may soon be sent to Haiti. The 82nd sent members to New Orleans, Louisiana, in the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina.","First team team will assess what Haiti needs to cope with the immediate aftermath .

"A beam of light is supposed to shine off into infinity, but when Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker whip out their lightsabers for some spark-flying action, the light blades extrude like stick deodorant and then just stop. It's like they're sticks of light-matter. Hollywood may have made that stuff up, but now, scientists at MIT and Harvard have actually made that stuff -- not enough for a lightsaber, only a subatomic smidgeon. But even that much is a big deal. Light-matter existed previously only in theory, but now, for the first time, it has been observed in reality, researchers from the Center for Ultracold Atoms say. To oversimplify things, we'll say that photons are subatomic particles that make up light. They have no detectable mass the way most matter does, and usually, they don't stick together.  You can shoot two lasers at each other, and the photons will pass right through one another. But physicists Mikhail Lukin and Vladan Vuletic recently got them to stick together to form molecules. They published the results of their work in the science journal Nature this week. Scientists create mini-brains from stem cells . The newly created photon molecules don't behave like traditional light, but more like a lightsaber, Lukin said. ""The physics of what's happening in these molecules is similar to what we see in the movies."" But don't picture yourself swashbuckling with a lightsaber just yet. As in the creation of pretty much all unusual matter, scientists have to produce extreme conditions in laboratories that can't exist naturally anywhere on Earth. They pumped atoms of rubidium, a kind of metal, into a vacuum chamber -- air would otherwise rapidly alter them. This created a metal cloud that they cooled down with lasers to about -450 degrees Fahrenheit, near what is called absolute zero. That makes atoms almost stand still. Then they fired photons into the atom cloud. The photons, elements of light, did not shoot through at the speed of light but acted a little like regular matter instead. They bumped into the atoms in a way similar to the way regular matter would. In the process, the photons slowed down enough to bump into each other and bond into molecules. It was a first. Scientists confirm new element 115 after atoms collide . Though that's fascinating, it doesn't make for a handy lightsaber. But it could help in the future development of super computers known as quantum computers, Lukin said. And with some work, scientists could make whole crystals out of light. So, if Darth Vader shows up with a lightsaber, your great-grandchildren may be able to throw photon rocks at him. But don't count on it.
