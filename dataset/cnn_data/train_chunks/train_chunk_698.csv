A Roma pickpocketing ring which trafficked hundreds of children across Europe threatening them with severe beatings if they did not go out to steal has been smashed, French police claim. More than 200 children, some as young a 12, would allegedly be given targets of stealing up to £250 a day before being dropped off in central Paris or other cities and ordered to target tourists.

The suspected masterminds are a married .

The pair, along with four other Romanians have been charged with people trafficking, forcing minors to commit crimes, money laundering and criminal conspiracy, the Times newspaper reported. Officers said the children were being 'trafficked for criminal purposes' to other countries, describing it as the biggest family-based network exploiting Eastern European youths they had ever discovered. Roma children are seen jumping across the tracks at a Paris Metro station. French police say many of the youngsters involved had been arrested hundreds of times but were always sent back to steal .

Jailed: Benefit cheat Christopher Mullen, 71, has been sentenced to eight months in prison . A wealthy pensioner who said he claimed £100,000 in benefits 'by mistake' because he couldn't read the paperwork has been jailed. Christopher Mullen, from Salford, Manchester, cheated the system for nearly 10 years while sitting on a £235,000 nest egg. He was caught out after the large bank transfers he had made to other accounts attracted the attention of the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The 71-year-old initially claimed he couldn't read and write and had unwittingly signed forms that his late wife of 47 years had filled in. However, he has now been locked up for eleven months after finally admitting he knew what he was doing when claiming the money he wasn't entitled to. The father-of-five's benefits claims were originally legitimate when they began in February 2000, Manchester Crown Court heard. However, after banking £235,000 from the sale of a property in Ireland, he failed to notify the authorities. Instead, he continued to claim benefits - including the maximum payout for pension credit, plus housing and council tax benefits - as if he was a poor man with no savings or investments to fall back on. He held onto the cash as he wished to pass on to his children and grandchildren, the court heard. David Temkin, prosecuting, said that by the time the Department of Work and Pensions unravelled Mullen's deceit, he had taken £104,974.16 from the taxpayer that he wasn't entitled to. He added: 'Mullen was interviewed and put forward a prepared statement in which he said he struggled to read and write, his wife used to do the paperwork, he would just sign it.' Mullen's defence lawyer said the defendant and his wife had not wanted the children's inheritance to be 'dissipated', and that he had maintained a 'modest' lifestyle throughout. Cheat: The father-of-five cheated the benefit system for nearly 10 years while sitting on a £235,000 nest egg, Manchester Crown Court heard . However, the court heard that Mullen had been convicted for a bogus benefit claim back in 1982 . Mullen, who admitted three counts of failing to notify authorities of a change in circumstances, looked stunned as he was sentenced to eleven months in jail. Sentencing him, Judge Michael Leeming told him: 'It will take 341 months to clear the amount over 28 years. You will be 99, presuming you make it that far, before it's paid off. 'You are a benefits cheat. You know it, your family who remain supportive of you know it, and when this case is reported, your friends and neighbours and the wider public will know it too, and rightly so. 'These offences are easy to commit and difficult and time-consuming to detect. 'Thousands of people in this country claim benefits legitimately - you point the finger of suspicion at them through your activities.'","Christopher Mullen, 71, cheated the benefits system for nearly 10 years .

It is customary for a newly arrived ambassador to meet with Emperor Akihito to present credentials. The procession was accompanied by palace officials in European-style ceremonial costumes, including a footman in breaches, led by a horseman astride a white horse. Kennedy was appointed ambassador after helping President Barack Obama's re-election campaign.

Edwin Reischauer, President Kennedy's envoy, would be the second.

Six former British soldiers are in an Indian jail after being arrested while providing anti-piracy protection to a US ship. The MV Seaman Guard Ohio was detained on 12 October and its crew, which includes Britons, Indians, Ukrainians and Estonians, have reportedly been held in Chennai since 18 October with Indian authorities claiming the vessel entered Indian waters with a huge cache of weapons on board. The ship is operated by AdvanFort, a private US firm specialising in maritime security, training and intelligence operations for shipping and had some 35 crew members on board. Detained: One of the men is former Parachute Regiment member Billing Irving, 33 and his girlfriend Yvonne MacHugh, (both pictured) 25, from Connel, northwest Scotland, is campaigning for his release . Concern: Mick Dunn, 27, who also served in The Parachute Regiment in Afghanistan, Iraq and Northern Ireland has been detained since October . Six of the men are British and their families are petitioning Foreign Secretary William Hague to intervene. One of the men detained is former Parachute Regiment member Billy Irving, 33 and his girlfriend, Yvonne MacHugh, 25, from Connel, northwest Scotland, is campaigning for his release. She told the Scottish Daily Record: 'They are being held on suspicion of committing offences under the Passport Act, Essential Commodities Act and the Firearms Act but they haven’t been charged. 'They are trying to say they had illegal firearms but the company gave documentation to say that everything was above board. Obviously I worry every time he goes away, but nothing bad has ever happened before. Billy is just saying that he sends his love to us all and that he doesn’t know anything.' She said she had three letters from her boyfriend through the British consulate, but was unsure if her letters had got through. Held: The MV Seaman Guard Ohio was detained on 12 October and its crew, which includes Britons, Indians Ukrainians and Estonians, have reportedly been held in Chennai since 18 October . Another one of the men imprisoned is Mick Dunn, 27, who also served in The Parachute Regiment in Afghanistan, Iraq and Northern Ireland. His sister Lisa Dunn, 34, from Ashington, Northumberland, told The Times that her younger brother had phoned as he was being taken away. 'He said ""We're all being arrested and we have been transported to the police station. I love you. I do not know when I will speak to you next."" ' Last month the BBC reported that the chief engineer of the Sierre Leone registered ship had attempted to take his own life while in jail. Police said others present in the cell prevented the man from taking his life - his nationality is not known. There have been differing accounts of why and how the ship came to be stopped. The Indian authorities say they intercepted the American ship when it was reportedly sailing off the coast of Tamil Nadu. But last month AdvanFort released a statement thanking 'Indian officials for providing a safe harbour for its vessel.' It said India's coast guard and police had allowed the vessel to enter the port to refuel and shelter from a cyclone which had hit India's eastern coast. It added that all weaponry and equipment on board was properly registered. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman told Mail Online: 'We can confirm the detention of six British nationals from the ship, MV Seaman Guard Ohio, on 18 October in India. 'We are providing consular assistance and are in touch with the local authorities.' In June four Brits sailing a converted warship to Africa on what they describe as an 'anti-piracy' mission were arrested off Senegal. Armed marine commandos boarded their decommissioned fast attack gun ship Defender, which had two fearsome-looking cannons, and took them into custody in Dakar. The Senegalese authorities said the four - all ex-UK servicemen - were detained on suspicion of 'illegal activity'.","The MV Seaman Guard Ohio was detained on 12 October .

The veteran cop, who is approaching the end of his run as the city’s longest-serving police commissioner, said in a scathing interview that he felt betrayed.

One of the planks of De Blasio's campaign was to promote the end of stop and frisk which he calls a violation of civil rights.

'They’re just saying you’re Number 1, Mr. President,' Kelly replied. Last week de . Blasio met with Bloomberg as the two men . started to discuss his transition into City Hall. The . two men have never been particularly close and it showed through . Bloomberg's expressions as he stayed straight-faced- and even pouted- . during their meeting.

The archvillain from the James Bond films - who's often seen stroking a white cat - might be making a return to the big screen following a settlement between studio MGM, production company Danjaq and the estate of Kevin McClory. McClory was a co-writer of the 1965 movie Thunderball with Bond book writer Ian Fleming but was embroiled in a legal dispute over the movie rights for over 50 years. On Friday, the three parties announced that Danjaq and MGM had acquired all of the rights and interests relating to James Bond from the McClory estate and family. Terms weren't disclosed. The McClory family's law firm said McClory created the iconic character, Ernst Stavro Blofeld and the global terrorist organization he headed, SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), which were not part of the original novels. William Kane, a lawyer who represented the McClory estate, said in a statement that the settlement 'will benefit James Bond film fans throughout the world.' The legal dispute dates back to 1959, six years after the publication of Fleming's first Bond book, Casino Royale. The estate claims that McClory then proposed to Fleming that they set a James Bond movie in the Bahamas, which later became Thunderball.

Following a legal tussle, McClory was able to produce Thunderball in 1965 and put out the 1983 film Never Say Never Again, which brought back Sean Connery as Agent 007.

For years Never Say Never Again has been left out of the Bond canon. The movie is not listed on the official James Bond 007 website, and was not included in last year's 'Bond 50' box set of discs celebrating 50 years of James Bond, dubbed 'The Complete 22 Film Collection.'

The makers of Monopoly have advanced to Lagos in Nigeria to launch the first African city edition of the famous board game. Instead of Mayfair or Boardwalk, players will have the chance to buy Banana Island, a prestigious development where properties in the real world fetch millions. The cheapest square - the Old Kent Road of London or the Mediterranean Avenue of the U.S. version - is a fishing slum on stilts known as Makoko. All go in Nigeria: Promoter Fiona Donald holds a Lagos edition of Monopoly at the launch of the first African city version of the game . Hoping for a big number: Lagos state governor, Babatunde Raji Fasholarolls (centre), rolls a dice during the presentation of the Lagos-themed Monopoly board game . The Nigerian Stock Exchange, which replaces London's 'Super Tax: Pay £100', and Murtala Muhammed International Airport also feature, while traditional favourites such as the Chance and Community Chest cards keep pride of place on the iconic board. The 'go to jail' card has been adapted to say 'go directly to Kirikiri jail', the city's maximum-security prison. The Lagos State Government was heavily involved in bringing the game to Nigeria not just to promote the country, but also as a means of educating the public about road safety, it was reported by CNN. Many pedestrians are killed in the heavily congested city every year while trying to run across roads. Rich and poor: Banana Island replaces Boardwalk from the U.S. version, while Makoko is the Lagos equivalent to London's Old Kent Road . Goodbye Mayfair: The most expensive square on the board was chosen as Banana Island, an artificially created island where only the richest live . Illustrious: On Banana Island (pictured) properties can fetch as much as $8million (£4.9million) Poor man's property: The cheapest square on the board is Makoko, a fishing slum on stilts . American's Mediterranean Avenue: Makoko established itself as a fishing village in the 18th century and now has a population nearing 100,000 . One Chance card, for example says: 'For using the overhead pedestrian bridge over Ikorodu Road, move forward three spaces'. According to the BBC another reads: 'You've been caught driving against traffic. Report for psychiatric evaluation.' Speaking ahead of the launch in Lagos City Hall, Nimi Akinkugbe, the head of Bestman Games which is producing the authorised Lagos edition, told the Nigerian Guardian that the choice for the Mayfair spot was a 'hot topic'. The eventual winner, Banana Island, has . property which would rival that of the prestigious London district, with . some selling for $8million (£4.9million). That square and many others have been sponsored by businesses. But no-one wanted the cheapest. By contrast, Makoko is a slum neighbourhood built on stilts that was established as a fishing village in the 18th Century. Hasbro Inc, which owns the rights to Monopoly, said Bestman Games Ltd would distribute the Lagos version of the game under an exclusive licence. But some feel a stumbling block to the game's success could lie in the price. In the U.S. and the UK, the game typically costs around $18 and £10 respectively. In Nigeria, however, it will set you back about $40 (£24), a hefty sum for the common man there. Trading places: Other squares include the Nigerian Stock Exchange, which replaces London's 'Super tax: Pay £100' and Bourdillon Road instead of Park Lane . Prime real estate: Bus Rapid Transit Terminal, Tiamiyu Savage St and Lagos Yacht Club are among some of the other destinations that feature . Not just a game: The Lagos State Government was keen to bring famous game to Lagos in part to educate the public about road safety, as can been seen with this Chance card . Iconic: The London version of Monopoly, which was originally developed in Atlanta in the U.S. in 1933 . While Lagos is the first African city to get its own version of the game, Morocco and South Africa already have their own country-wide edition. There is also a Kenyan property game which resembles Monopoly, set in Nairobi, called Kumiliki, which means 'to own' in Kiswahili. Monopoly was developed in the U.S., originally based on streets in Atlantic City, in 1933. A London version of the game was produced two years later. BRITISH VERSION . Old Kent Road .

Flexing his pecs and showing off his speed, President Barack Obama stripped off for some beach football to round off his Christmas holidays in Hawaii. As his Republican rivals were deep in preparation for the Iowa caucuses, these photos show President Obama had his mind on diving headlong for catches and tossing touchdowns to his friends from the Secret Service. The 50-year-old looked surprisingly lean on New Year's Day at the Kaneohe Marine Corps Base on Oahu, where he stayed with the first family for their 10-day vacation. Game player: As his Republican rivals were deep in preparation for the Iowa caucuses, Barack Obama had his mind on diving headlong for catches and tossing touchdowns to his friends from the Secret Service . Game on! Barack Obama was pictured playing football during his Hawaii holiday . The football game brought to an end a relaxing and fun-filled 10 days for the President who arrived in Hawaii a week later than he had hoped. He would have enjoyed an even longer period away from the White House had there not been a stalemate in Washington D.C. over the payroll tax cut. But he certainly made up for lost time as, within an hour of arriving on December 23, he took wife Michelle out for dinner at one of their favorite hotspots, Morimoto Restaurant. Then, on Christmas Eve, they spent some family time together with daughters Sasha and Malia in the morning. Relaxation: The football game brought to an end a fun-filled 10 days for the President who arrived in Hawaii a week later than he had hoped . During the afternoon the couple split their time as President Obama went to play golf and the First Lady answered phone calls from expectant children who called NORAD to see where Santa was on his route. Like many families, the Obamas spent Christmas morning by themselves, opening presents and singing carols. They then attended church services at a nearby naval base and talked with military families afterwards. President Obama had no public schedule when he arrived in Hawaii but his schedule seemed to fill up quite quickly. The entire Obama clan was joined by their family friends the Nesbitts as they took a drive from their multi-million dollar rented vacation home to the Sea Life Park marine sanctuary.

Though he tried to keep a low profile throughout the trip, he and his motorcade was seen driving to and from the golf course a number of times. One of his golfing partners was an old high school buddy Robert 'Bobby' Titcomb, who was arrested in a prostitution sting. After golf that day, the boys were joined by the First Lady and President Obama's sister Maya Soetoro-Ng at Alan Wong's, one of Hawaii's priciest restaurants. In an act of reflection, the President and  Mrs Obama visited the Pearl Harbor memorial and paid tribute to the thousands who lost their lives there 70 years ago. It was his first visit since 2008, when he was president-elect. And then on New Year's Day, the family went back to their roots by paying tribute to two different generations. They first visited the grave of President Obama's maternal grandmother, Stanley Durham, and later they went to an exhibit honoring President Obama's mother, Ann Durham, and the work she did overseas in Indonesia. It was afterwards that he managed to squeeze in a game of football - the photographs of which some have compared to Vladimir Putin's display of masculinity in promotional pictures. The Russian Prime Minister is well known for posing with his top off in a bid to demonstrate his power and virility. Later that night, the Obamas left the girls at home while they joined 10 friends for dinner in the private room at celebrity hotspot Nobu Wakiki.

Failed heist: Kyle Handley (pictured above) is one of the four arrested for kidnapping a medical marijuana dispensary owner and sexually mutilating him in the desert while trying to rob him . Four people were arrested and charged this week for kidnapping a man, burning him with a blow torch and severing his penis while trying to extort money they believe he buried in the desert. In addition to 34-year-old Kyle Handley, who was arrested a year ago, police apprehended Ryan Kevorikan, 34, and Naomi Kevorkian, 33, in Fresno, California on Friday. A fourth suspect, 34-year-old Hossein Nayeri, was arrested on Thursday in the Czech Republic and is facing extradition. He fled to Iran after the crime and was flying to visit family in Spain at the time of his arrest. Prosecutors said the four people in their thirties carried out a plan to kidnap the owner of a California medical marijuana dispensary when they believed he was hiding money in the Mojave desert. The plans for the kidnapping were put in motion after Handley went on an 'extravagant and expensive' trip to Las Vegas with the victim and other growers. Handley supplied the 29-year-old victim's marijuana dispensary. When he returned from the trip, Handley told the three others that the victim  was 'extremely wealthy' and they developed a plan to rob him. For weeks, the four staked out the victim's home and followed him on several trips he took to the Mojave Desert. They believed he was hiding money in the desert, when in reality he was looking into an investment deal. On October 2, 2012, the four broke into the victim's home by using a ladder to climb up to the Balboa Peninsula home's deck. The plan: The group of four conspired to rob the 29-year-old victim who they believed was 'extremely wealthy' and his stashes of money in the Mojave Desert . Breaking in: After staking out the victim's home for several weeks, they eventually broke in on October 2, 2012 using a ladder to get onto the home's deck . Inside, they found their target as well as his roommate's 53-year-old girlfriend. They tied up both before driving them off to the Mojave Desert. In the secluded desert, the group tortured the man in an attempt to make him reveal his hidden stash of money. They beat him up, burned him with a blow torch and even chopped off his penis. That's when they knew for sure there was no buried treasure. They decided to abandon the man and woman in the desert, taking the penis with them so that it couldn't be reattached. They also poured bleach all over the man believing it would destroy any DNA evidence connecting them to the incident. Going for a trip: The group kidnapped the man and woman and drove them north to the Mojave Desert where they believe he was hiding money . After the group drove off, the woman ran for a mile down the side of the road and eventually flagged down a police car. According to authorities, the male victim spent 'an extensive period of time in the hospital recovering from his injuries'. Authorities connected the four to the crime after a 'thorough extensive investigation'. Initially, police pegged Handley because the car neighbors reported seeing outside the victim's home was registered to him. The other three were linked to the crime through DNA evidence. All four were charged Friday with two felony counts of kidnapping and first degree residential burglary. If convicted, they could spend the rest of their lives in prison without the possibility of parole. Handley already plead not guilty to all of the charges last month.","On October 2, 2012 a group of four people kidnapped the 29-year-old owner of a  medical marijuana and took him to the Mojave Desert .

Frank Culbertson helplessly watched from space. Culbertson, 63, an astronaut who was aboard the International Space Station at the time, was the only American who wasn’t on Earth as the country came under attack on September 11, 2001. While 220 miles above the Earth aboard the International Space Station, Culbertson took incredible pictures of the Twin Towers after they were struck by the hijacked jets. Scroll down for video . Unique view: Frank Culbertson took this picture of the 9/11 attacks from the International Space Station. He was the only American off-planet at the time . As word of the terror strike reached him, the station was passing over New York, and what he saw had a profound effect on the astronaut. In a letter he wrote from the space . station, Culbertson said: ‘I zipped around the station until I found a . window that would give me a view of NYC and grabbed the nearest camera. Moved: Culbertson spoke of his horror at seeing 'wounds pouring from his country' He then watched as plumes of smoke rose from the areas of Manhattan and Washington, DC. Culbertson wrote: 'The smoke seemed to have an odd bloom to it at the base of the column that was streaming south of the city. 'I believe we were looking at NY around the time of, or shortly after, the collapse of the second tower. How horrible...' Nasa was asked to monitor the area above Manhattan after the Twin Towers came down and its satellite photographs the smoke rising from Ground Zero the following day. Culbertson also wrote of his anguish at being separated from his friends and family at such a tragic time, and the loneliness he felt. He said: 'Other than the emotional impact of our country being attacked and thousands of our citizens and maybe some friends being killed, the most overwhelming feeling being where I am is one of isolation.' He added: ‘It's difficult to describe how it feels to be the only American completely off the planet at a time such as this. The feeling that I should be there with all of you, dealing with this, helping in some way, is overwhelming.' The International Space Station travels at about 17,000mph, which means it orbits the Earth 15 times a day. But even as he sped high above the planet, Culbertson could tell that it was shaken to its core. He wrote: 'Obviously the world changed today. 'What I say or do is very minor compared to the significance of what happened to our country today when it was attacked by …. by whom? Terrorists is all we know, I guess.' Adding to the tragedy of that day, he later found out that Charles Burlingame III, who had graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with Culbertson was the pilot of American Airlines Flight 77 before it was taken over by terrorists and flown into the Pentagon. Culbertson, who flew in two shuttle missions prior to his arrival at the International Space Station, returned to Earth in December 2001, and has since retired. Nasa monitored the site of the attack: This image was taken by the Landsat 7 satellite on September 12. Smoke can clearly be seen streaming away from Ground Zero .

The desperate 911 call a wildlife sanctuary owner made upon discovering the body of his colleague moments after she was mauled to death by cougars has been released. The crackly recording hears Mike Tuller, the owner of WildCat Haven, in Sherwood, Oregon, cry, 'Oh my God', as he discovers the remains of Renee Radziwon-Chapman, 36, in the big cat enclosure. It is believed the new mother was savaged as she cleaned out the animals' cage alone on Saturday night, in a possible breach of the park's safety procedures. 'I have a keeper at WildCat Haven that was attacked,' Mr Tuller frantically tells the 911 operator. 'I think she's dead but please hurry.' Scroll down to hear the recording . WildCat Haven in Sherwood, Oregon says animal technician Renee Radziwon-Chapman was alone in a cage of cougars when she was killed Saturday night. Despite the operator's pleas to stay safe, Mr Tuller then entered the cage to drag Ms Radziwon-Chapman away from the circling predators, one of which had blood around its nose and mouth. 'I don't want you to get hurt,' the dispatcher says. 'I hear what you're saying,' Tuller replies before yelling at the cougars to get back. 'You think she is beyond hope?' the operator asks. Breaking the rules? According to a statement released by the sanctuary, Radziwon was discovered alone in an animal enclosure with cougars which goes against their safety guidelines. Above, Radziwon-Chapman gives a reporter a tour of the facility in 2011 . 'That's the same question I asked, but yes, I do,' Tuller replies, before dragging Radziwon-Chapman out by her boots. Radziwon-Chapman, . who worked at the sanctuary for eight years, died from multiple bite . injuries, with the most severe wounds around her head and neck, Dr. Christopher Young, a forensic pathologist for the Oregon State Medical . Examiner's Office, told ABCNews.com . Few . details have been released on the attack so far, but it appears that . Radziwon-Chapman was breaking the facility's safety rules when she was . attacked. A statement released by the organization . refers to their safety handbook which requires staff members to work in . pairs when going into animal enclosures. Once big cats are safely in . 'lockout areas' one team member can go into the enclosure. Deadly: Radziwon-Chapman was killed by a cougar, and the cougar to blame was locked up after the incident. (Above picture is not the cougar that attacked her) 'At this time it is believed that Radziwon-Chapman was alone at the sanctuary and alone in the enclosure with cats, who had not been shifted into the lockout area,' the statement said, adding that an investigation is ongoing. While it was initially reported that several cats were loose within the sanctuary, the organization denied that saying that no cats escaped from their enclosures, which are surrounded by 14-foot tall walls. 'The enclosures exceed what is required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which inspects the facility yearly,' they said. The cougar responsible for Radziwon-Chapman's death was locked up after the attack. 'Right . now, out thoughts and prayers are with the family of our dear colleague . and friend who we have so sadly lost. We are devastated by this loss,' the statement said. Radziwon-Chapman's husband, Aaron Chapman, had also volunteered at the facility in the past and the two recently had a baby girl. WildCat Haven was started in 2001 by Cheryl and Michael Tuller who rescued one bobcat but their sanctuary has now grown to shelter 67 Cats. For the past eight years, Radziwon-Chapman has served as the head keeper at the facility and is also a certified tech. As the sanctuary's first employee, Radziwon-Chapman has spoken to the media on behalf of the facility before. In 2011, she gave KATU a tour of the facility for a story about people who keep big cats as exotic pets. Sanctuary: This is the website for the WildCat Haven Sanctuary just outside Portland, Oregon where the tragic attack occurred . 'I don't think people realize how many cats are in captivity in back yards,' Radziwon-Chapman said in 2011. Some of the cats living at the sanctuary come from families who adopted them at a young age and then got overwhelmed with them once they grew into full-size cats.

A craftswoman who heard an 'almighty crash' as she vacuumed was shocked when she saw two cows had toppled through the roof of her home, crushing her furniture. Sue Marshall had been was cleaning the converted barn where she lives when she was rocked by an 'almighty crash'. Ms Marshall, a professional weaver, feared a tree had fallen onto the workshop of her property in Lamorna, near Penzance, Cornwall. Shock: Craftswoman Sue Marshall was stunned when two cows fell through the roof of her home as she cleaned, causing thousands of pounds of damage . Gaping: The hole left in the roof of Sue Marshall's workshop after the cows plummeted through the ceiling of her converted barn . However, when the 77-year-old entered the room she saw a cow stood in the workshop . after it fell through her roof and flattened a table and chairs. Ms Marshall managed to shoo the beast out of her property, but just minutes later a . second cow, who had followed the first, fell through another part of the . roof. The two animals crushed the majority of the furniture in the room but narrowly avoided the weaver's expensive loom. Wild cow chase: Ms Marshall with one of the cows which fell through the roof of her workshop . Ms Marshall said: 'I was hoovering at the time and heard an almighty crash. I assumed that a tree had come down. 'I . was astonished to find that a cow had fallen through the roof of the . workshop, narrowly missing my loom and leaving a huge hole in the roof. 'No sooner had I let the startled animal out than another one fell through another part of the roof. 'Both cows narrowly missed the loom, which was incredibly fortunate, and neither was injured. I was in absolute shock.' The animals had been grazing in a neighbouring farmer's field before they climbed onto the sloped roof to get to greener grass. Mrs . Marshall said the first cow was 'extremely eager' to leave and ran out . the back door - but its companion was more reluctant to go. She . added: 'The cows were clearly distressed, the first careered out of the . yard into an adjacent field, the second decided to hang around and made . a bit of mess of the garden. 'I . looked up at the fence and saw the rest of the herd looking on, a . helpful neighbour came to our aid and made sure no more came through the . fence.'

Damage: The animals tore a hole through the roof of Ms Marshall's workshop and flattened much of her furniture, although fortunately they missed her expensive loom . 'Fortunately no one was physically harmed and neither of the cows suffered any injuries. 'Livestock . owners are potentially liable through common law and statute for . accidents caused by animals straying, so land or animal owners should . ensure that all fences are kept in reasonable order at all times.' The farmer responsible for the cows has now put a new fence in place to stop further animals trying to escape.","Cattle had climbed onto Sue Marshall's sloped roof to reach grass .

The Deputy Prime Minister revealed Chancellor George Osborne is actively considering imposing Capital Gains Tax on foreign oligarchs . Foreigners blamed for inflating the London property market are set to be hit with new tax raid, Nick Clegg indicated yesterday. The Deputy Prime Minister revealed Chancellor George Osborne is actively considering imposing Capital Gains Tax on foreign oligarchs, who are currently exempt from the charge when they sell a home in the UK. British homeowners are only exempt from the levy on their main property. Basic rate taxpayers pay 18 per cent, while higher rate payers pay 28 per cent. Mr Clegg said foreign millionaires should prepare to pay more since they are fuelling a housing boom which is pricing British customers out of the market in large parts of the capital. He said: ‘We certainly need to make sure that people who invest very large amounts of money into property in central London locations, which more often than not then stand empty, pay their fair share of tax in those transactions. ‘That’s why we are looking at things like a differential application of capital gains tax to those transactions.’ Blaming foreign investors for the house price boom, the deputy Prime Minister added: ‘There are parts of the London property market which are entirely divorced, dislocated, from the rest of the economy, certainly the rest of London’s economy, and still more from the rest of the nation’s economy. That’s partly because they are driven by market forces which are global.’ Mr Clegg said ‘decisions have not yet been made’ about changing the rules on Capital Gains Tax. But senior coalition sources say the plans are highly likely to be unveiled in the Autumn Statement next month. Another option would be for Mr Osborne to increase the rate of stamp duty charged on the sale of expensive properties. Last year, he increased to 7 per cent the stamp duty charged on the purchase of homes worth more than £2m and closed down loopholes that allowed buyers to avoid stamp duty by putting their homes into corporate 'envelopes'. Mr Osborne was willing to do a deal on a Mansion Tax, but David Cameron has repeatedly blocked it to avoid upsetting rich Tory donors . The chancellor needs cash to fund two party conference spending commitments: the Tory plans for a marriage tax allowance, which costs £600m and a Lib Dem promise to give free school meals to all infants. Treasury and Lib Dem sources say the CGT move is ‘not a huge revenue raiser’ but it is seen as a low risk move that will show voters the coalition is serious about making the rich pay and levelling the playing field between British and foreign investors. Mr Clegg again repeated calls for new property taxes and made clear that the Lib Dems will continue to argue for a Mansion tax on properties worth £2m or more or new Council Tax bands on high value properties. But his aides conceded there is little prospect of convincing senior Tories to back the plans. Mr Osborne was willing to do a deal on a Mansion Tax, but David Cameron has repeatedly blocked it to avoid upsetting rich Tory donors. ‘They have set their faces against it,’ the Lib Dem said. ‘Does anyone think it’s reasonable that if you live in a family home worth £700,000 in Lewisham you’re paying the same council tax as a millionaire in a £40 million mansion? ‘We have a significant number of property taxes but for reasons of history and accident, or downright prejudice on the part of my Conservative colleagues, who simply don’t want to ask people in very high value properties to pay a bit of extra, we’re saying to hard pressed families: “You have to pay property tax but someone in a multimillion pound mansion down the road doesn’t.” 'That strikes me as unfair.’ Treasury sources refused to comment on ‘speculation about the Autumn statement’ but pointed out that the Chancellor has ‘already taken action in this area’.","Deputy Prime Minister revealed Chancellor George Osborne is considering imposing Capital Gains Tax on foreign oligarchs .

Nick Clegg’s new adviser on motoring has seen the value of his electric car firm slump by a fifth after three vehicles burst into flames. Billionaire Elon Musk, who founded PayPal, was revealed by the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday to be working with the government  on how to increase take up of electric cars. But his company Tesla Motor Inc has suffered a string of bad headlines about Model S electric cars being destroyed by fires. Guru: Elon Musk was named by Nick Clegg named Mr Musk as a new adviser on electric cars . Mr Clegg said the government has enlisted the help of the electric car pioneer to advise ministers on how to reach a ‘tipping point’ for the take-up of green vehicles. The involvement of Mr Musk, who runs the firm behind the Tesla electric sports car, came as Mr Clegg called for large fleet companies, taxi firms and public agencies to explain what more could be done by ministers to encourage them to change to ultra-low emission vehicles. Setting out the details of Mr Musk's role, Mr Clegg said: ‘He brings unmatched expertise to the table. Among other issues, he'll consider how we can boost investment, massively increase the take up of electric vehicles across the country and promote the benefits of ultra-low emission vehicles more widely to drivers.’ However, in the last week shares in Tesla have tumbled on the back of three Model S electric cars catching light and poor trading figures. A Tesla Model S electric car caught fire . this week after hitting road debris on a Tennessee freeway, the third . fire in a Model S in the past five weeks. Two previous fires have also been linked to accidents, Tesla insists. This Telsa Model S caught fire and became engulfed in flames on a Tennessee highway on Wednesday afternoon . Tesla has sent a team to Tennessee to investigate the fire. Two other Model S cars have caught fire in the past five weeks, one near Seattle and the other in Mexico . The Model S has as a large battery pack under the passenger compartment, protected by a quarter-inch-thick metal shield. Experts . say that if debris punctures the shield and damages the battery, it can . cause shorts and arcing that can touch off fires. Yesterday shares fell by seven per cent, after falling by 14 per cent on Wednesday. The company has also posted weak financial results, after admitting selling fewer of the £60,000 cars than expected. Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book, said: ‘For a company with a stock price based as much or more on image than financials, those recurring headlines are highly damaging.’ The Model S can go more than 250 miles on a single charge . Mr Clegg had hoped Mr Musk's appointment would be the centrepiece of a speech attacking the Tories over their reluctance to commit to the green agenda. But after news of the latest fire, a spokesman for the Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘We are not under any obligation to follow any of his recommendations.’ Mr Musk will not be paid to write his report on increasing the roll-out of charging points for electric cars, due to be published in the New Year. The Government wants all new cars and vans purchased in the UK to be ‘effectively zero emission’ by 2040 and £400 million has been committed over the course of this Parliament to support the technology.","Deputy PM names billionaire Elon Musk as green motoring adviser .

Parents who force their children to marry face jail sentences under tough laws to be unveiled tomorrow by Theresa May. The Home Secretary will promise a sweeping crackdown after warnings that up to 8,000 young women a year are pushed into wedlock without their consent. David Cameron says forced marriage, which involves families from Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and east Africa, is 'little more than slavery' and 'completely wrong'. The Home Secretary has warned that up to 8,000 young women a year are pushed into wedlock without their consent . The new laws will see the Government tackling an issue which has proved highly sensitive in the past. In 2004, Labour considered making forced marriage a criminal offence, but dropped the plans before the 2005 General Election amid fears it would be resented by ethnic voters as an 'intrusion' into minority cultures. Forced marriage prevention orders were introduced in 2008, but these put the onus on a victim to apply to a civil court for protection, rather than criminalising those who tried to force them into marrying. For a criminal conviction, the authorities must currently try to prove that those responsible have broken other laws, such as kidnapping, false imprisonment, harassment, or assault. Breaching a prevention order is also punishable by up to two years in jail, but for contempt of court. Tomorrow Mrs May will announce that a specific criminal offence of forced marriage will be created, meaning anyone who tries to compel someone to wed against their will could be jailed. Legislation is expected to be introduced next year. It is part of the Government's attempt to smash Labour's doctrine of multiculturalism, which ministers argue meant unacceptable practices such as forced marriage were not tackled effectively. David Cameron has said while most weddings involving families from Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and east Africa are happy celebrations, the Government will crack down on forced marriages . Home Secretary Theresa May (left) and David Cameron are spearheading the tough new laws that will be announced tomorrow . Mr Cameron believes a blind eye has been turned to extremism for too long for fear of offending minorities. Some schools have even refused to put up posters advising pupils about forced marriage for fear of causing offence or being branded racist. Last year, 1,468 forced marriages were investigated by the authorities but experts believe the true total is as high as 8,000 a year. Cases often involve a girl or young woman being taken abroad, usually on the pretext of a holiday, then forced to marry a man they have never met in accordance with an arrangement reached by the two families. One young girl from Yorkshire was married off by her parents when she had just turned five, while two teenage sisters were forced to wed strangers on the same day during a trip to Pakistan. A Government source said: 'Some of those who oppose the criminalisation of forced marriage argue that it could disempower victims, as they might want a non-criminal resolution of their case and reconciliation with their family. Baroness Warsi said in the worst cases children were drugged and taken overseas, where they were married off . 'However, to avoid deterring victims from coming forward, the civil remedy will continue to exist alongside a new criminal offence. This means that a victim could choose to take the civil route, or to go to the police. 'Even when criminal proceedings are under way, the victim will have the right to stop those proceedings. 'The new law will be accompanied by a range of measures to increase protection and support for victims, as well as maintaining a focus on prevention.' Mrs May will announce a £500,000 fund to ensure schools and other agencies know how to spot early signs of a forced marriage. Every local authority will have one official in charge of training for police, judiciary, health agencies and social services. The Government also plans an advertising campaign over the summer to highlight 'the right to choose' who you marry. And ministers will sign up to the Council of Europe's convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, which requires the criminalisation of various forms of violence against women, including forced marriage. Conservative chairman Baroness Warsi, who has pushed for a change in the law, said in the worst cases children were drugged and taken overseas, where they were married off. 'It's now time to say no. The tragedy of these stories is long term. People are trapped in loveless marriages for a long, long, long time,' she said. 'There is often no relationship and they live as strangers in the same home. Forced marriage is akin to slavery and it is going on in Britain today. But it is time to draw a line in the sand and say enough. This is not acceptable.' The new law will seek to draw a clear distinction between arranged and forced marriage. 'A forced marriage is where there is no consent. The time has come to call a halt,' Lady Warsi added. The cross-party Commons Home Affairs Committee had called for forced marriage to be criminalised, but ministers have spent some months considering how to proceed without discouraging victims from coming forward. One further measure being considered is for all those marrying abroad to be legally required to declare their intent first with their local registrar in Britain. Religious ceremonies would be void unless they were also entered in the civil register.","David Cameron says forced marriage is 'little more than slavery'

That’s because Ms Lavi, a single mother, turned to in vitro fertilisation to become pregnant while in Israel, giving birth to her girls there. When she tried to obtain citizenship for her twins at the US consulate in Tel Aviv, she was denied because she could not prove the egg and sperm used to conceive her children were from those of US citizens.

Loving mother: Ms Lavi carried her girls Maya and Sheila to term and gave birth to them in 2009 . Ms Lavi was asked by an embassy staffer if her daughters, born in 2009, were hers, as USA Today first reported. Even more humiliating, she said, was that the consulate worker asked her through a loudspeaker in a room teeming with people how she conceived the twins. Ms Lavi, who is from Chicago, told the Today that she was offended by the question, which she considered an invasion of privacy. ‘I was embarrassed, humiliated, horrified, ashamed,’ she said. ‘It’s an outrageous question.In an interesting loophole, children adopted from other countries are eligible to become US citizens. The issue lies in a law that says, according to the US State Department, that a child must have a biological link with at least one parent. Stipulation: Maya and Sheila cannot become US citizens unless their mother moves them back to the US and they live there six months - but their home is in Tel Aviv . Humiliation: Ms Lavi said she was angered and embarrassed when a staffer at the US Embassy asked her how her daughters were conceived . Because her twins Maya and Sheila were conceived via in vitro fertilisation, there was no such link between Ms Lavi and her daughters. Most fertility clinics do not keep records from donors, and are anonymous, thus making it impossible for Ms Lavi to prove the nationality of her daughters’ biological parents. However, Ms Lavi carried the twins to term and delivered them, and her name is on their birth certificates – she, of course, is listed as their mother. Ms Lavi told Today: ‘US policy is not keeping up with the technology. That’s essentially what the issue is.’ According to Michele Koven Wogal, an . Israel-based attorney who focuses on U.S. immigration law, calls the . probing questions ‘profiling,’ saying that the embassies only ask . single, older women where their children came from. In vitro, veritas: Because Ms Lavi doesn't know the nationality of the sperm and egg donors, the US Embassy denied her twins citizenship; she said the law is lagging behind modern technology (file photo) As USA Today notes, around 200,000 US citizens living in Israel have dual citizenship – which allows them to receive IVF treatments for free. Maya and Sheila could become U.S. citizens if they lived in the States for at least six months and completed other necessary steps. However, as Today notes, the family is situated in Tel Aviv. For the moment, Ms Lavi has given up the uphill citizenship battle. ‘If I’d gone back to the States to give birth, my children would have automatically received American citizenship.

The $2,199 (£1,370) handmade stool, designed by Mary Dickerson, compresses when under pressure. Soft as a cushion: The Ash Cushion is deceptively soft because it is made of strips of notched wood which compress under pressure . The 19x12x18inch stool is extra wide and based on Dutch designer Carolien Laro’s work, Spring Wood Collections, which cleverly pushed the limits of wood. Ms Laro developed a collection of stools and three-seater benches in 2010 and won the Wood Challenge Prize and was nominated for the IMI Award and the DOEN material prize. Deceptively soft: The handmade stool, designed by Mary Dickerson, is made entirely of ash wood . Nice notches: The strips of ashwood have had pieces sliced out of it, allowing it to bend and compress unlike solid pieces of wood . Ash wood is often used by carpenters and designers because of its versatile physical properties including its strength and flexibility. Ms Dickerson's design comes as a team of Swiss designers have developed a rocking chair that can transform energy from its rocking motion to charge an iPad or iPhone. Built according to the classic, proven . rocking chair design, the seat - which its makers have dubbed the iRock - . uses a built-in generator that transforms gentle swaying into . electricity.

Its makers claim that just an hour of . easy swaying will charge your iPad to 35 per cent, and it is also . compatible with other Apple devices - although publicity pictures . suggest it uses the old-style connector. The chair uses a winding mechanism . combined with a set of gears to create enough force to drive the . generator, which the development team says was a challenge to make . energy efficient enough for practical use. iRock: This rocking chair which charges your iPad as you use it is the brainchild of a Swiss design team .

After a year of bearing the noise, and at their wits' end, they decided to pay builders hundreds of pounds to smash through two walls in a bid to find its source. But the destruction turned out to be fruitless - after they discovered it was an old smoke alarm in a chest of drawers. Destruction: Paul Henry, pictured, and his wife, spent hundreds of pounds hiring builders to smash through two of their walls to find the source of a bleeping noise . After fruitless searching, Mr Henry found an old alarm clock at the bottom of a chest of drawers . The smoke alarm had a 10-year-old battery inside it which was - unsurprisingly - running out. Mrs Henry, 68, who lives in Frinton, Essex, with her husband, 67, said: 'To think that we put up with this for a whole year when it had been there in the draw all along. 'But at least the noise had stopped at long last.' The couple were being driven slowly mad by the bleep after it started more than a year ago. They finally cracked when the irritating noise went from happening occasionally to going off every 30 seconds for more than two weeks. After searching high and low, they decided to bring in professionals in their bid to get some peace and quiet. Retired print worker, Mr Henry, said: . 'We really had tried everything to find the damn noise and it had just . about driven us to the edge of sanity. 'We . really were at our wits’ end - when I was telling friends about it, . they were looking at me and thinking I was going round the bend.' The retired print worker was so frustrated when he found the smoke alarm that he smashed it with a hammer . Damage: The couple will now have to pay hundreds of pounds to get the wall fixed . They initially hired an . electrician to carry out tests on their home’s wiring and when that . failed, they shelled out £300 for builders to smash holes in . their two walls with a sledgehammer. The electrician suggested a builder may have dropped a smoke alarm in a gap in the wall and it was beeping as it ran low on battery power. He added: 'At first we did think it was our smoke alarms, so we replaced the batteries on them but the noise was still going. 'Eventually it was happening 24/7 and we still had no idea where it was coming from. 'When we hired the electrician, he killed the power to the house yet the beeping continued. 'It . was then that he chirped up and suggested that it sounded like a . mischievous builder had dropped a smoke alarm into the wall. 'We just had to find out, so I got a local builder in and he crashed through the wall with his sledgehammer.' Nothing was found. But just as Mr Henry was reaching the end of his tether, he decided to rummage through a chest of drawers. And to his delight, hidden at the bottom was a five-year-old smoke detector, encasing a 10-year-old battery which was running out. Upon finding the alarm, Mr Henry decided to smash it to pieces with a hammer. The couple have now been left with a gaping hole in their wall, which is expected to cost hundreds more pounds to repair. The alarm was a spare one left over from Mr Henry's voluntary work for Age Concern about five years ago, when he had been handing them out to pensioners. He added: 'I had been given a load of these alarms and this was one that had been left over and forgotten about at the bottom of the drawer underneath a pile of old Christmas cards. 'Everyone had an opinion on what it might have been, and when I found it and showed it to Jeanette, I said ""you are not going to believe this"".'","Paul and Jeanette Henry from Essex suffered from bleeping for a year .

She was charged with assault and ordered to appear before magistrates in Cambridge where she admitted the offence. The court heard that Currall has been waging a long-running feud with cyclists over the shared path outside her home in the city. Monica Lentin, mitigating, said the pensioner 'felt anxious' walking along the path because of cyclists speeding past.

'The pedestrians do feel extremely harassed and I feel the same way myself. Currall has been waging a long-running feud with cyclists over the shared path outside her home in the city . 'What makes it worse is you get lots of young men with powerful bikes riding at speed without any conscience that older people can’t get out of the way easily.

American-born Mr Ramage, 40, who is a fellow at Sidney Sussex College, said the incident on September 12 had left him shaken. 'I’ve encountered her with my kids and it’s upsetting for them,' he said. 'Hopefully the sentence will mean something to her and change her behaviour so I think I’m happy from that point of view.' Currall was ordered to pay £25 for Mr Ramage’s dry cleaning plus £100 court costs and given a one-year conditional discharge.

'He used to be there talking to the boat people. I had just turned 16 and we got married when I was 19. At the first wedding there was just my two sisters and his parents and uncle. 'But at the second one there was quite a few, the room was packed and we had bridesmaids and page boys and over 60 guests.' She added: 'When we got married the first time I was pregnant with our oldest child Carol and she now jokes she is the only child who has been to both weddings. 'It was nice though because my sister Matilda was my bridesmaid at the first wedding and was a witness at the second ceremony. 'It’s a case of better the devil you know. Arthur was always there for me through the years and we never lost touch. We stayed close because of the children and even lived over the road from each other.' But the couple's path to true love certainly hasn't run smoothly. In the intervening years, Linda enjoyed two 10-year relationships with other men, while 66-year-old labourer Arthur had a long-term girlfriend. Wedded bliss: The couple tie the knot for the second time in the same place and on the same day as the first . Early years: Linda and Arthur spent the early years of their married life travelling Britain's network of canals . Following the end of their last relationships, the couple, now great-grandparents, decided to rekindle their 50-year romance. 'We decided to try again as a couple earlier this year because Arthur was always coming around and helping out with my dog and garden,' explains Linda. 'So he moved in to my house a few weeks ago and we decided to get married again. I wanted it to be at the same place on the same date because it would be special.' The couple, who have 12 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, moved in with Arthur’s parents in Wellingborough in 1966. They then moved to live with Linda’s parents who had moored the canal boat in Coventry, before returning to Wellinborough in 1976. They didn’t get divorced until 1997 but stayed separate until January this year when they realised they wanted to get back together. Signing up to marriage: The pair complete the ceremony at a Wellingborough register office . Family: The couple have 12 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren - all of whom came to the wedding . And they decided to give married life a second chance - much to the delight of their children Carol, 46, Louise, 44, Roger, 43, Tony, 41, and Lynnette, 32. Linda added: 'We had six children in total but the youngest died when she was two days old. I needed Arthur to be with me but he was needed at work and that was the cause of us splitting up. 'He was at the funeral but he had to rush off to work and that was the final straw for me. I had two 10-year relationships but lived over the road from Arthur from the 90s. 'And earlier this year we realised he was helping out so much with my dog and my garden and doing my shopping that we should get back together. Now I don’t think we’ll ever look back.' Arthur, who describes himself as a jack of all trades, added: 'I did have another partner but knew Linda was always the one for me. 'We stayed so close and were seeing each other a lot and have never been far apart. Everyone was saying it was about time we got married again and it feels like we have never been apart.'","Linda and Arthur Treadwell, both 66, first married in 1966 but split in 1985 .

Now seven months pregnant, the Duchess of Cambridge might have expected all eyes to be on her sizeable bump. But windy weather and her flimsy outfit had other ideas. Kate was left red-faced after the gusts lifted up her £38 polka-dot dress, drawing attention instead to her thighs. The royal mother-to-be was caught out by the wind as she arrived at the wedding of friends Willian van Cutsem and Rosie Ruck Keene, in south Oxfordshire, just over a week ago. Whoops: A seven months pregnant Duchess of Cambridge was hit by an unfortunate gust of wind which blew up her skirt and exposed her thighs . Seemingly unaware that her skirt had blown up, revealing her shapely legs, she gripped her black and white fascinator rather than her hem, laughing as she did so. It happened as she walked towards St Mary the Virgin Church, in the village of Ewelme in the Chiltern Hills, on Saturday, May 11. The duchess appeared not to have learned her lesson from the last time she wore the Topshop dress, when she suffered a similar wardrobe malfunction. Having fun: The royal couple arrived separately at St Mary the Virgin Church, in the village of Ewelme in the Chiltern Hills . She was forced to hold down the back . of the black and cream outfit as she arrived at the Hertfordshire-based . Warner Bros Studios with Princes William and Harry, last month. The High Street bargain sold out . within hours of her wearing it, but the dress may not get a third . showing after proving unsuitable for the gusty British weather once . again. Kate attended the . wedding with Prince William, who arrived separately and was believed to . have been an usher, wearing the same morning suit, blue striped shirt, . and dark red tie as the groom.

Arriving alone: Kate attended the . wedding with Prince William, who arrived separately and was believed to . have been an usher . The couple have known the van Cutsem family for many years and the groom's niece, Grace, was a flower girl at the royal wedding. Famous: Marilyn Monroe's dress blows up in the 1955 movie 'The Seven Year Itch' Kate's embarrassing moment, reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe in film The Seven Year Itch, was one of several for the duchess. In . July 2011, during a North American tour, her cream and navy cable-knit . Alexander McQueen dress was whipped up by the wind as she met . wellwishers in Charlottetown, in Canada.

But the duchess, who is expected to give birth on July 13, handled all the mishaps with her usual poise.

Virginia State Senator Creigh Deeds was discharged from hospital Friday morning, three days after being stabbed multiple times by his troubled son at their Bath County home. The son, 24-year-old Austin 'Gus' Deeds, turned a rifle on his himself moments after brutally attacking his father on Tuesday during an altercation out front of their house. Gus had undergone a psychiatric evaluation one day earlier and was set to be committed, however a bed could not be located for him in a Virginia mental health ward. Deeds, 55, was able to walk out of the home and down a hill on his property to Route 42, where he was picked up by a cousin who happened to be driving by. Deeds was airlifted to UVa. Medical Center, where he was initially listed in critical condition, however has since made an impressive recovery and was allowed home Friday morning. From home he spoke for the first time since the incident, Tweeting: 'I am alive so must live. Some wounds won't heal. Your prays and your friendship are important to me.' Creigh Deeds is in critical condition and is fighting for his life after he was stabbed at his home in rural Bath County, Virginia . Tension: Austin 'Gus' Deeds took a semester off school in 2009 to help his father Creigh on the campaign trail. They are seen here together traveling between campaign stops . Discahrged: Virginia State Sen. Creigh Deeds has been released from here, the University of Virginia Medical Center, Friday morning following an improvement in his condition . 'I'm so relieved he's doing better, but the tragedy is that he'll be living with this for the rest of his life,' Va. Sen. Janet Howell, a friend and colleague of Deeds, told NBC Washington. Virginia State Police have confirmed they are treating the incident as an attempted murder and suicide and said it occurred about 7.25am Tuesday. But they have not commented on a motive. Troopers and first responders attempted to treat Gus Deeds, but he died at the scene. His body was taken to the medical examiner in Roanoke for an autopsy. Creigh Deeds has now been able to speak to investigators. The incident has raised new questions about the capacity of Virginia's mental health system. On Monday, Gus was evaluated by psychiatrists in Williamsburg after an emergency commitment order was filed against him. He was only released because there was no room for him at any psychiatric wards in western Virginia. Now the Washington Post is reporting that  three hospitals within a two-hour drive of Bath County did have beds available, and two of the three say they were never contacted by the Rockbridge County Community Services Board trying to find a placement for Deeds son. The state inspector general has now launched an investigation to find out what led to Gus Deeds' release after the custody order was issued. 'Regardless of whether or not there were beds, there was not a system to determine if there were beds available,' Howell said. Virginia politician Creigh Deeds used this Tweet, posted on Friday after he was discharged from hospital, to reassure people he was recovering . Virginia State police surround the home of Senator Creigh Deeds in Millboro today to investigate the fatal incident . 'I'm so relieved he's doing better, but he'll be living with this for the rest of his life': Va. Sen. Janet Howell, a friend and colleague of Creigh Deeds, speaks to the media about the attack . Gus had been a student at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, which he attended off-and-on since 2007. He took a semester off school in 2009 to help his father with his losing campaign for governor. He was enrolled this year, but withdrew from the university last month. Administrators said he was a music major with a 'strong academic record.' On his Facebook page, Gus listed his political views as: 'Too busy with love to care.' He was one of four children of 55-year-old Deeds. Gus was arrested for alcohol possession in May 2009 when hew was 20 after police caught him at a house party near his home. Colleagues of Sen. Deeds said they've heard of difficulties with his son but never imagined an outcome like this.

New life: Deeds married Sibohan Lomax, left, in 2012 after meeting her when he was teaching law at Washington and Lee University . Family tragedy: Deeds is seen here after winning the Democratic nomination for governor in 2009 with his son Gus, left, his two daughters and his now ex-wife Pam . Gus Deeds was found alive in the house, but he died . before he could be stabilized and put on a helicopter. Despite his extensive wounds and extensive blood loss, Deeds - who was considered critical upon arrival at hospital - has been able to speak with investigators and give them information about the attack. Deeds rose to national fame during the . 2009 Virginia governor's race in which he lost by a landslide of nearly . 18 percentage points to Bob McDonnell. He and his wife of two decades, Pam, . divorced in February 2010 after the embarrassing loss turned him into a . punchline in some political circles. Deeds said his marriage to Pam, right, fell apart because of the rigors of his political career. The two divorced in February 2010 . In 2010 he told the Washington Post that the divorce was 'a casualty of a nearly 20-year pursuit of a lifelong ambition that kept him away from home.' He married Siobhan Lomax in a quiet ceremony in June 2012. Lomax, . 44, owns a boutique near the campus of Washington and Lee University in . Lexington, Virginia, where Deeds has been a visiting law professor . since 2010. Condolences immediately began to pour for Deeds and his family.

Governor Bob McDonnell, a Republican who beat Deeds in the governor's race in 2009 and for attorney general in 2005, also offered his condolences. 'In this tough and sad time, our thoughts and prayers are with the Deeds family. The news from this morning is utterly heartbreaking,' McDonnell said in a statement.

From animated brown bears at John Lewis to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley on a magic carpet ride for M&S the competition for festive ad of the year has never been fiercer. Now Sainsbury's are making a bid for seasonal stardom - and have hired an Oscar-winning director to ensure their film, Christmas In A Day, hits the spot. Inspired by Kevin Macdonald's award-winning Life In A Day movie, the 45 minute film features a series of ordinary people celebrating on Christmas day in footage filmed by themselves. The adorable 'Smith' brother and sister are two of the stars of the Sainsbury's Christmas 2013 film . The film has been created by Life in a Day director Kevin Macdonald . The full 45 minute film will be released on YouTube on November 29 . Macdonald spent hundreds of hours splicing together the crowd-sourced clips to create a heart-warming feature film, a teaser for which is unveiled exclusively below for Mail Online readers. The full film, produced by Ridley Scott, will be released on the 29th November. Macdonald, who is  also known for his . films Touching The Void and The Last King of Scotland, created the . documentary and the ad campaign from the more than 360 hours of . festive footage he received from all over the UK. 'I . was overwhelmed by the creativity and enthusiasm of the people up and . down the country, from every walk of life, who filmed their Christmas . and shared it with us,' says Macdonald. Enjoying the day: Contributor Mr Fletcher shows the world how he celebrates Christmas in the new film . Communal Christmas: Elderly ladies make the most of a live band during a festive event at their care home . Busy: For Mrs Masters, Christmas Day means donning an apron and producing a slap-up festive lunch .

'I feel that the finished film stands out for many reasons – it is . funny, moving, often beautifully shot and above all truthful.  I am . immensely thankful to everyone who took part and to Sainsbury’s for . making the film possible.' Speaking about how the concept behind the film came about, Macdonald revealed that it originally began as an offshoot from his last crowd-sourced film, Life in a Day. 'It was . completely unlike any film that I had made before, and it really was an . experiment in creating the opportunity to hear and see ordinary people . share their lives, their loves and their fears,' says the director. 'And . while we were working on it we kept talking about what an ""in a day"" film might be like if we could just choose a particular day that was . already significant to people, and thought it had to be Christmas, . because it is the one time in the year when everyone steps back from . ordinary life for a day and we get to stop and think about our lives in a . way that we are all just too busy to during the rest of the year.' Oscar winner: Macdonald (centre) took the best documentary prize for One Day in September in 1999 . Triumph: His 2006 film Last King of Scotland, about Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, also took home an Oscar . He added: 'People have been hugely generous sending us more than 360 . hours of footage. My approach to Christmas In A Day was to look at . everything and think about what the footage revealed about the different . ways we celebrate or approach Christmas. 'There are so many . experiences which are common to so many of us, rituals and preparations, . being with family and friends, or being alone, it was all there in the . contributions that people sent in. 'I feel that the film stands out for . many reasons, it is funny, moving, often beautifully shot, but above all . there is beauty in the ordinariness of it.' Sainsbury's, who will also be running . a traditional food-based campaign over the festive period, say they . hope the film will reveal something 'really interesting about the way we . celebrate Christmas.' 'When we saw the film, we realised it had far exceeded our expectations,' they explained. 'We . believe this film is something very special indeed and I am proud that . Sainsbury’s has been involved in this project from the outset. 'By . having the film as our lead Christmas activity, I hope we’ll encourage . millions of people across the UK to watch the story of Britain’s .

Career criminal: Nathaniel Hemy, 15, has been jailed after carrying out a terrifying armed robbery . A career-criminal schoolboy who committed his first offence on the day after his tenth birthday has been jailed today after carrying out an armed robbery at just 15. Father-to-be Nathaniel Hemy has nine convictions for 22 offences and was sent to a young offenders' institution after he threatened and robbed staff at a corner shop in Southampton. Hemy burst into the store as part of a hooded gang and threatened an assistant in her sixties with a large knife in the early morning raid, a court heard. The teenager followed ringleader Sid Pumford, who was brandishing a meat cleaver, and terrorised workers as they opened up for business to get them to open the safe, taking £150. Judge Peter Henry said Hemy has a 'terrible record' and sentenced him to three-and-a-half . years in a young offenders' institution. But his family today defended him and described his 'tough upbringing', where he was in and out of care and didn't even know his father's name. Jailing him Judge Henry said: 'You were taking an active and physical part in this robbery despite your young age. 'Although you were led, you did take a significant role in what happened. You participated in this robbery in an enthusiastic manner.' His . crime had had a devastating impact on his victims, who had been . carrying out their jobs to serve the public, he said. 'The shop assistant has suffered panic attacks, chest pains and one can only imagine the sort of effect what you did had on somebody like her.' The judge also commended the bravery and courage of Hemy's two victims. He . said: 'They were both met by the most frightening violence carried out . by this defendant and others in disguise, armed with potentially lethal . weapons, a meat cleaver and a knife. 'Having seen the CCTV it is quite clear that both of these members of staff displayed great courage. 'These . two are a shining example of how members of the public stand up to such . thuggish and violent behaviour.' Frightening: Hemy was part of a gang who raided this store and held staff with knives and meat cleavers - but he was caught after his mobile fell from his pocket . Southampton Crown Court heard he has a 17 year old girlfriend, who is heavily pregnant. His great-grandmother, Jacqueline . Williams, 71, who helped bring him up, today said: 'He had a tough upbringing. He never knew his father and doesn't even know his name,' she said. Mitigation: His family today spoke of his tough upbringing, where he grew up without a father and had stints in care . 'He went into care at just nine years old and his mother said she wanted him to grow up to be a nice young lad. 'We are so devastated as a family and I know he is gutted he will miss the birth of his first child. 'He has told me he doesn't want his son to end up like him.' He was sent to a foster home in the New Forest, but constantly ran away. Mrs Williams added: 'He would come and stay with me or his grandmother. 'We had a great relationship, but he definitely missed having a male role model in his life. 'Having a dad would have been good for him and growing up without one made it harder.' All of the schools that Hemy went to were for children with behaviour issues. Mrs Williams added: 'Obviously he made a huge mistake and he had to be punished - he is aware of that.' His . great-grandmother hopes that when he comes out of Medway Secure . Training in Rochester, Kent, he will be ready to start a family with his . girlfriend. Mrs . Williams, who has 18 grandchildren, four great grandchildren and soon . to be a great great grandmother next week, said they are in 'constant . contact'. Threats: Hemy is seen here on the right threatening a member of staff in her sixties as he and a gang robbed the shop in Southampton . She added: 'He is at Medway in Rochester in Kent. 'We speak to him on the phone every night and he's just disappointed that he won't be there for the birth of his son. 'He is such a nice young lad, he has good friends and is always rapping around the house - he even writes his own lyrics. 'I have always got his bedroom made up here and he's always welcome to stay - he's a good lad really.'","Nathaniel Hemy has nine convictions for 22 offences in just five years .

A vulnerable woman who was left without heating in her council-run supported accommodation was found dead, wrapped in a duvet after suffering carbon monoxide poisoning as she desperately tried to keep warm. Irene Simpson, 59, was discovered at her home in Wigston, Leicester, by her son-in-law, Andrew Athill, huddled in a duvet and clutching a hot water bottle next to a camping stove-style heater last December. She had also been burning charcoal in a metal bowl on the hob of her cooker in a bid to keep warm more than six months after her heating broke down. Irene Simpson had also been burning charcoal in a metal bowl on the hob of her cooker in a bid to keep warm . An inquest at Leicester Town Hall today heard that Ms Simpson, who had been diagnosed with a life-threatening heart condition and mental health issues, had not had central heating or hot water in her home since May 2012. Her heating broke down when council maintenance workers had turned off and condemned a faulty combination boiler at her premises. HM Coroner for Leicester, Catherine Mason, heard how the divorced grandmother-of-three had been moved by the local council from an independent living ground floor flat, into a supported housing bungalow. But when her worried family couldn’t get hold of her, on December 4 last year, they broke into her house using a crow bar - and found her dead, fully clothed and clutching a hot water bottle. It was only when toxicology tests, taken during the post mortem, revealed that carbon monoxide was a factor in Ms Simpson’s death that questions arose regarding gas safety checks carried out at the property. The family discovered the bungalow’s combination boiler had been condemned and had been turned off back in May. She had not had central heating or hot water in her home since May 2012 when council maintenance workers had turned off and condemned a faulty combination boiler at her premises . The inquest heard that the grandmother had not told her daughters, Stephanie Wakeling and Lisa Simpson, that she was living without any heating -and had made excuses for her daughters not to visit her at home. In a statement, son-in-law Andrew, who found her body, told the inquest: 'Irene’s two dogs were very aggressive when I entered the property, but as soon as I saw her I knew she was dead.' The inquest was told by a pathologist that the 59-year-old had died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning - but because of her existing heart condition, she succumbed to the poison more quickly than the average person would have. However, it has not yet been determined whether the carbon monoxide came from the gas heater or from the charcoal which had been burned on the cooker. Sally Lowe, housing officer from Oadby & Wigston Borough Council, was visibly distressed when she told the inquest that during a visit in August, Ms Simpson had told housing officers that she didn’t want any heating. She said: 'Irene wouldn’t engage with anyone in any way. 'She was a very difficult tenant, and any time we wanted to enter her property, we needed to get a police officer. A housing officer from Oadby & Wigston Borough Council, told the inquest that during a visit in August, Ms Simpson had told housing officers that she didn't want any heating . 'When we asked her about the boiler, Irene said that she didn’t want the heating, she said she’d have it in the winter when it got colder, but she didn’t want it.' Jay Stemp, the council’s property manager, admitted that the council had left Ms Simpson waiting for three months over the summer before making any attempt to fix her boiler. He said: 'Normally, a broken boiler would have been fixed within one or two days. 'In this case, for some reason, the problem wasn’t logged at the time when it should have been. 'The cooker and the gas fire in her property were still working, it was just her boiler. 'Calor gas fuelled heating is very common in properties, but I’ve never seen charcoal being burned. It’s very dangerous.' Council officials admitted that it took three month before they even attempted to access the property to fix the boiler. Coroner Catherine Mason said: 'It is very clear that what has happened should not have happened. 'There was a failure in communication. 'However, throughout the period, Irene maintained her independence, and could have asked for help.' She adjourned the inquest until December 2. Tony Hannington, a partner with Lime solicitors, who is representing Mrs Simpson’s family, commented: 'We are grateful to the coroner for investigating Irene’s tragic and untimely death. 'They still have many questions regarding their mother’s death, and we await the coroner’s verdict next month.'","Irene Simpson was discovered at her home by her son-in-law Andrew Athill .

Mrs Dewdney, 53, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was on a week-long paragliding holiday with her husband Nigel, who participated in the 2010 Paragliding World Cup and is the chairman of Malvern Hang Gliding Club, based in Worcestershire, according to reports. Carolyn Dewdney (not pictured) was flying in the mountainous area of Adeje during her holiday . Henry Willder, who runs Para 42, the specialist company which organised the trip, said Mrs Dewdney was believed to have suffered a heart attack during her flight and her husband was 'inevitably, absolutely devastated' following her death. 'We don't know for sure yet but it's believed she suffered a heart attack while flying and died,' Mr Willder said. 'That's what the forensic doctor who attended the scene told us. 'Until the complete autopsy takes place, we won't know anything more.' Mrs Dewdney was flying in a group of six including her husband and Mr Willder when she fell at around midday yesterday afternoon. Mrs Dewdney was believed to have suffered a heart attack during her flight . The group were more than an hour into their flight when Mrs Dewdney, who reportedly worked as a nurse at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, got into difficulty, Mr Willder said. 'Immediately when I saw she was in trouble I radioed to our ground crew to call for an air ambulance,' he added. Although a helicopter was scrambled, Mrs Dewdney was already dead by the time rescuers reached her, it was reported. The rest of group found flat ground to land on about a mile away from the site where Mrs Dewdney crashed. According to the forensic doctor who examined her at the scene, she had only suffered slight injuries including a broken arm, Mr Willder said. Simon Dillworth, a chief coach at Malvern Hang Gliding Club, confirmed they were aware of Mrs Dewdney's death and described her as a 'very experienced' paraglider. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national, Carolyn Dewdney, on November 12 in Tenerife, Spain. 'We are providing consular assistance at this difficult time.'","Carolyn Dewdney was flying in the mountainous area of Adeje .

A young mother, killed when the car she was in skidded off the road, might not have died had police acted following an earlier near-miss at the same spot, a coroner ruled. Christine Harrison, 28, died in March when the car she was travelling in crashed into trees after hitting standing water and leaving the road. At an inquest held yesterday, Durham Coroner Andrew Tweddle said the collision would never have happened if Durham Constabulary had acted differently following an accident which occurred in the same spot an hour earlier. A man miraculously escaped injury when his vehicle - which was written off as a result - aquaplaned on the same patch of standing water and left the road at about 4.30am on Saturday, March 9. Police attended the incident  - which happened on the A66 Bridge Road, near Darlington, County Durham - but the road was not closed and no signs were erected to warn motorists of the potentially deadly hazard ahead. Around an hour later, Ms Harrison was travelling along the road with friends in a Volkswagen Golf being driven by uninsured, unlicensed driver Daniel Podmore - who was later disqualified from driving and fined for his part in the incident. A tearful Podmore, 27, told the inquest at Crook Coroner’s Court that visibility on the unlit road made it impossible to see the water until the car hit it, causing him to lose control and veer off the road. Podmore and three others were injured but Ms Harrison - who was not wearing a seatbelt - tragically lost her life in the collision. PC Steven Musty, of Durham Constabulary, was the only officer to attend the scene of the first incident. A risk assessment he conducted showed that he deemed road closure unnecessary after watching a small number of vehicles negotiate the standing water successfully. He did not consider there to be enough resources to allow him to remain at the scene to act as a visible warning to motorists. He also decided against erecting any of the police warning signs he carried in his vehicle - though he did ask his control room to contact the council to request rection of flood-warning signs. He told the inquest: 'It is not normal protocol to leave signs at a scene as I would not have been able to take them with me to the next job.' Coroner Tweddle recorded a verdict of accidental death but added: 'There are a number of features of this case which give considerable cause for concern. 'I would question the decision making processes that PC Musty employed to come to the conclusions that he did. 'It raises the matter of training, which needs to be addressed. 'I find it difficult to give full credibility to a number of aspects of evidence he has given when I read his statement and take into account evidence he has given today. 'The deceased died an accidental death. It is unlikely she would have died had she been wearing a seatbelt. 'The collision would not have occurred had the incident scene been better managed by Durham Constabulary.' A police spokesperson said: 'This incident was voluntarily referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission who recommended a local review be carried out. 'This review has been carried out and recommendations have been formulated. 'The coroner today recorded a verdict of accidental death and made the recommendation that police consider reviewing training to ensure staff highlight and manage risk appropriately. 'Durham Constabulary will be giving consideration to the coroner’s findings. 'We continue to extend our condolences to the family of Christine Harrison following the tragic events and our officers are continuing to support them at this extremely difficult time.' Both PC Musty and Daniel Podmore offered their condolences to Ms Harrison’s family during the inquest.","Christine Harrison, 28, died in March when the car she was travelling in crashed into trees after hitting standing water and leaving the road .

Released: Republican Marian Price has been in custody for two years but will now be out on licence . An IRA bomber who was jailed for a car bomb attack on the Old Bailey is set to be released from prison following a ruling by the Parole Commissioners. High-profile republican Marian Price, 58, had served seven years after the 1973 car bomb attack before being released on licence, but her licence was revoked by former Northern Ireland Secretary of State Owen Paterson in May 2011. She has been in custody ever since and is facing two dissident Republican-related charges. Republicans have been conducting a high-profile campaign for her release and she has ongoing health issues which have required treatment in Belfast City Hospital during her time in prison. She is now known by her married name Marian McGlinchey. A statement from the Northern Ireland Office said: 'The Parole Commissioners have decided, given her current circumstances, to release Marian McGlinchey on licence. Such a licence is normally subject to conditions.' She was convicted along with her sister Dolours Price for their role in the 1973 car bomb attack on the London court, which resulted in the death of one man and injured more than 200. Price died in Dublin earlier this year. The NIO statement, on behalf of current Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, said: 'Marian McGlinchey’s licence was initially revoked in May 2011 by the then secretary of state for Northern Ireland following a recommendation made by a single independent parole commissioner. 'All such cases are subject to a full review by the parole commissioners at which the prisoner has a right to full legal representation.

'This can include the appointment of a special advocate to represent the prisoner’s interests in respect of any closed material that may have been presented during the hearings. 'The parole commissioners’ decision reflects the fact that my predecessor’s decision to revoke Mrs McGlinchey’s life licence was justified in May 2011. This decision was taken after receiving a recommendation from the parole commissioners that her licence should be revoked. 'Information about the proceedings of the parole commissioners are not to be made public and the Northern Ireland Office therefore cannot comment further.

The Queen's composer has attacked the state of music teaching in Britain, branding it 'disgraceful' that so many young people do not know who Mozart is. Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Master of the Queen's Music, said it . was both 'a disgrace' and 'a shock' that so many youngsters had now . never even heard of Mozart or Beethoven - let alone listened to their . music. He blamed successive governments for treating classical music as 'an elitist fringe activity.' The 79-year-old musician, rated as the world's greatest living composer, says it's shocking that youngsters do not know Mozart . It now means that both he and acclaimed . violinist Nicola Benedetti in have warned about the dangers of a . generation growing up ignorant of the world's greatest works. He said he backed 'to the hilt' Ms Benedetti in calling for every young person to be 'made' to study classical works to help them understand humanity. The Orkney-based 79-year-old musician, rated as the world's greatest living composer, said Ms Benedetti, who recently worked with about 200 young musicians at the Royal Albert Hall, had done 'a great service' in highlighting the issue. Benedetti said it was ridiculous that classical music was marginalised in schools because of the perception that children do not find it 'fun' 'I think she is a great ambassador and role model and absolutely right,' said Sir Peter, who recently was given the all clear after a cancer battle. 'I step down as Master of the Queen's Music in March but I plan to concentrate my time on helping to make classical music more accessible to young people. We are in grave danger of losing - through not learning or experiencing - centuries of a wealth of wisdom and works. 'There are hundreds of thousands of youngsters who now have never even heard of Mozart or Beethoven. It is shocking and a disgrace that has been allowed to happen. 'The same applies to Shakespeare and Dickens. It just shows what has gone wrong with areas of the educational system. 'I don't think the problem is limited to 'right or left' governments and councils. I'm afraid successive governments and local authorities have seen classical music as an elitist fringe activity. 'But it has been shown time and again that learning to play a classical instrument - or sing - makes you much cleaver, more confident and a better team player, as well as many other benefits. 'In this day and age when every bit of information is accessible through the internet to anybody who has a computer, the role of the creative arts has never been more important. 'If the same information is available to everyone, the challenge is who can use it the most creatively? That's why classical music is probably more relevant in today's society than it is has ever been - it hone's people's creativity, not just as musicians. 'Playing a musical instrument promotes a child's self-esteem by improving several key skills and habits - and I think all children should be made to study classical works. We are at a serious tipping point. We are in danger of centuries of learning being lost to the dubious influences of vacuous celebrity culture and inane talent shows.' Teachers 'should be encouraged to take children through symphonies and explain the form in detail', the musicians claim . 'If there is one thing I believe passionately about it is that children should have free access to learning an instrument. 'I am furious that some councils think it is perfectly acceptable to charge for instrument tuition. It is not - they are shameless and are unnecessarily limiting the life chances of those who can least afford it. Many young people don't even recognise the works of some of the world's greatest composers such as Mozart (pictured) and Beethoven . 'It goes against the very ethos of widening music across all social classes. The danger is that music becomes the preserve of the better off - the parents who can afford to pay - while talented children from poorer families miss out.' Recently West Kilbride-born Ms Benedetti said 'there should be a substantial amount of complex great music in schools. It's insane to me that there isn't.' She said teachers should be encouraged to take children through symphonies from Beethoven and Sibelius to Dvorak and Mahler and explain the form in detail. 'Every single young person in this country should be made - within the context of their school curriculum - to listen to the greatest classical works,' she said. The 26-year-old musician, who last month won the best female artist at the Classic Brits, said it was ridiculous that classical music was marginalised in schools because of the perception that children do not find it 'fun.' 'Since when did everything have to be fun? Music can be fun and enjoyable, but it also provides a way to go as deep as you can into our history and our understanding of humanity; of our expression and growth as people,' she said. 'It makes me sad, the gross misunderstanding of its potential and power and influences.' In the New Year Honours, Ms Benedetti was as a appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to music and charity.","Peter Maxwell Davies, Master of the Queen's Music, blames governments for treating classical music as an 'elitist fringe activity'"

Measure B, a law that requires porn actors to wear condoms, has done little to protect the porn industry financially. Ever since the law passed in Los Angeles County, permits for porns have dropped 95 per cent. The News Daily reports that in November of last year, 480 film permits were filed in Los Angeles. This year, only 24 permits were filed, said CEO of the Free Speech Coalition, Diane Duke. Duke said that Permits cost $,1000, and the lack thereof has cost the county of $450,000 in revenue. The Free speech Coalition has a history of being opposed to measure B and gives the reason that actors are tested for HIV every 14 days. Wrap it up: After a law that requires porn actors to wear condoms passed in Los Angeles, many producers have been looking to shoot porns in neighboring towns . Measure B doesn't require that actors get tested, and therefore could put them at risk for disease. Measure B was enforced by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health(OSHA) to ensure the safety of porn actors. Unfortunately, less people want to watch porns with actors wearing condoms. Porn Actress Lily Lebeau told Slate, I wouldn't mind using condoms more. It's just not what people want to see.' If people don't want to see it, they wont pay for it. People are still filing porn permits, but they're doing it in neighboring towns. City of Los Angeles Safer Sex in the Adult Film Indistry Act: LA porn actors must wear condoms during porn shoots in the area . 'Most production companies have ceased shooting in LA County. They have other options in other states and communities,' said Diane Duke to Capitalbay.com. The neighboring city of Camarillo issued a 45-day moratorium on porn productions because a a growing number of requests to shoot in the area caused concern for city officials. Camarillo doesn't have a condom rule so officials called the moratorium to 'study it so we can craft certain regulations,' said assistant city attorney Don Davis. 'Now that they’ve put some restrictions on them that inhibit them, they’re trying to move out of there. We don’t want them to migrate to our area,' Camarillo councilman Mike Morgan said. Camarillo fears that the porn industry will begin to infiltrate the community because they can't shoot elsewhere. Linda Parks, a Ventura County supervisor, told the LA Times that residents near Thousands Oakes were complaining about an increase in porn shoots. 'People are hearing moans and seeing naked people,' she said. Smaller production companies in L.A. may be secretly avoiding permits which poses regulation problems and keep the county from making revenue.","Measure B, a law that requires LA porn actors to wear condoms, has left producers searching to film porns elsewhere .

The fireball, reportedly seen from as far north as Fairfield to as far south as Gilroy, as well as in Sacramento, Newark and Walnut Creek, was captured on video by one observer at around 7.45pm last night. It was bluish in color and appeared to be heading straight to the ground, according to an NBC Bay Area reporter. Scroll down for video .

On the horizon: The fireball was reportedly seen from as far north as Fairfield to as far south as Gilroy . Unexpected: It was bluish in color and appeared to be heading straight to the ground . ‘I saw that meteor/fireball over Solano County after spending the day reporting on asteroids and fireballs,’ said NBC reporter Jodi Hernandez. Another viewer told the local news outlet that the fireball was a bright green when it first appeared and then turned to a bright yellow as it faded. ‘It was awesome!’ she said. Meteors are pieces of rock and metal from outer space that fall to Earth and burn up as they pass through the Earth’s atmosphere. The bright flashes of light are caused by the burning. At around 2.30pm EST on Friday, a meteor passed over Siberia and exploded with the force of 20 atomic bombs. Most of the injuries were caused by flying glass, local officials said. Terrifying sight: A massive meteorite shower left a thousand people injured, buildings devastated and the mobile network wiped out when debris hit Russia on Friday . Terrifying: Brightly burning rocks could be seen for hundreds of kilometres as they crashed at around 9.20am local time and one bystander described it 'like a scene from the Armageddon movie' Spectacular sky: The Urals region was struck by falling meteorite fragments which fell in the city of Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border . Marina Moskvicheva, Chelyabinsk health chief, told the Russian news agency Interfax that 985 people in her city asked for medical help and 43 were hospitalized. It was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century and occurred hours before a 150-foot asteroid passed within about 17,000 miles (28,000 kilometers) of Earth. Planetary scientists said there were no connections between the meteor that passed over Siberia and the larger asteroid. It is unknown if the fireball spotted in California had any connection to the asteroid. Gerald McKeegan, a local astronomer in California, told NBC that based on accounts he believes that the fireball spotted in northern part of the state was a ‘sporadic meteor,’ which he said can happen several times a day. McKeegan said that sporadic meteors bring as much as 15,000 tons of space debris to Earth each year.

Child abuse images are being unwittingly hosted by ordinary websites, according to an internet watchdog. In the last six weeks, there have been an unprecedented number of reports of the illegal images appearing on pages as mundane as furniture websites, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said. The charity said it had received 227 reports in that time of websites being hijacked by hackers who post images of child abuse. Abuse epidemic: In the last six weeks, there have been an unprecedented number of reports of the illegal images appearing on pages as mundane as furniture websites, says an internet watchdog . The IWF said it was a new phenomenon that it was unable to explain as most of the people who are taken to view these images do not want to see them. The figures, given to BBC Radio 5 live Breakfast with Nicky Campbell by the IWF, demonstrate the difficulty of the battle to remove child abuse images from websites. Folders containing the images are uploaded on to an ordinary website but can only be accessed by other - usually pornographic websites - the charity said. It is only by clicking on the link which takes you through to the relevant part of the ordinary website that the images can be viewed. The chances of an everyday internet user stumbling upon the images are slim, it adds. In one example, a furniture website was hacked and a folder containing hundreds of child sex abuse images was uploaded, it said. The IWF said that the illegal images are often coupled with malware and viruses which may be a reason why hackers post them on other websites. It is unlikely that those who host the original adult site containing the link would have any idea that a third party had set up the diversion to the ordinary website and uploaded the images. IWF technical researcher Sarah Smith said: ‘We hadn’t seen significant numbers of hacked websites for around two years, and then suddenly in June we started seeing this happening more and more. ‘It shows how someone, not looking for child sexual abuse images, can stumble across it. The original adult content the internet user is viewing is far removed from anything related to young people or children. ‘We’ve received reports from people distressed about what they’ve seen. Our reporters have been extremely diligent in explaining exactly what happened, enabling our analysts to re-trace their steps and take action against the child sexual abuse images. ‘Since identifying this trend we’ve been tracking it and feeding into police forces and our sister hotlines abroad.’ Susie Hargreaves, CEO of the IWF, said: ‘Hackers are planting folders of criminal content on ordinary business websites. ‘We came across a furniture website which was hacked and it had a folder containing hundreds of images of child sexual abuse and these are some of the worst of the worst. ‘And that’s just an example of one of the 227 reports we’ve received over the last six weeks of these hacked websites.’ Victims: The Internet Watch Foundation said that it had seen a 42 per cent increase on last year of reports to its online hotline since the murders of Tia Sharpe, left, and April Jones, right . The IWF was set up by the internet industry to report child sex abuse images, which are illegal, to the police and to provide a hotline so members of the public can report the images. The IWF said that it had seen a 42 per cent increase on last year of reports to its online hotline since the Tia Sharpe and April Jones cases. Their attackers Mark Bridger and Stuart Hazell had both sought child sex abuse images online. It receives up to 170 reports a day from people who have spotted something disturbing online. John Carr, a government advisor on child internet safety, said that hackers often attach viruses to images in order to create a new distribution point to send out more images. He said: ‘This reduces the risk that the bad guys will be caught or traced because they have hijacked the machines that other people are using. Their computer then becomes a distribution points for those images.’ The fact the folders of images were hidden on normal websites also meant that paedophiles would know where to find them, he said. He added that the recent upsurge in activity suggested that a criminal gang might have newly adopted the approach.","Internet Watch Foundation says it received 227 reports in six weeks of websites being hijacked by hackers posting images of child abuse .

Noses come in all shapes and sizes but men's tend to be larger - 10 per cent larger, in fact. The reasoning behind this was not fully understood but now scientists think they have solved the mystery - and it is because men need more oxygen than women. The research carried out by the University of Iowa found that the difference in size comes from the sexes' different builds and energy demands. Experts found that the difference in size comes from the sexes' different builds and energy demands - men have more lean muscle mass . Males in general have more lean muscle mass, which requires more oxygen for muscle tissue growth and maintenance. The size differences become apparent around the age of 11, when men begin to grow more lean muscle mass and women grow more fat mass. Previous research has shown that, during puberty, around 95 per cent of body weight gain in males comes from fat-free mass, compared to 85 per cent in females. Scientists say the new study also . explains why Neanderthals had such big noses in comparison to modern . humans - they had much more muscle mass. Scientists found that male noses grow disproportionately larger than female noses at the beginning at puberty (pre-pubescent boy pictured top left, pre-pubescent girl pictured top right; same male pictured in adulthood on bottom left and same female pictured in adulthood, bottom right) Study lead author Doctor Nathan Holton, assistant professor at the University of Iowa College of Dentistry in the United States, looked at nose size and growth of 38 people of European descent.The research team took external and internal measurements at regular intervals. They found that boys and girls generally have the same nose size, from birth until around the age of 11. From that point onward, the size difference grew more pronounced. Doctor Holton said: 'This relationship has been discussed in the literature, but this is the first study to examine how the size of the nose relates to body size in males and females in a longitudinal study. Scientists believe that Neanderthals (reconstruction pictured) had big noses because they were very muscly . 'We have shown that as body size increases in males and females during growth, males exhibit a disproportionate increase in nasal size. This follows the same pattern as energetic variables such as oxygenate consumption, basal metabolic rate and daily energy requirements during growth.'Doctor Holton's research also explores why Neanderthals had bigger noses than modern humans. 'So, in humans, the nose can become small, because our bodies have smaller oxygen requirements than we see in archaic humans,' said Doctor Holton. 'This all tells us physiologically how modern humans have changed from their ancestors.' Previous research also appears to support Dr Holton's findings. In a study published in the European Journal of Nutrition, researchers documented that men's energy needs are twice those of that of women's after puberty. Dr Holton also believes that his research, published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, helps us to understand the nose as a 'valuable extension of our lungs'. 'So, in that sense, we can think of it as being independent of the skull, and more closely tied with non-cranial aspects of anatomy,' he said. 'Even if the body size is the same, males have larger noses, because more of the body is made up of that expensive tissue. And, it's at puberty that these differences really take off.' Dr Holton says the findings should hold true for other populations, as differences in male and female physiology cut across cultures and races, although further research is needed.","Experts found that the difference in size comes from the sexes' different builds and energy demands - man have more lean muscle mass .

A computer guru and multi-millionaire who became the biggest single donor in the 900-year history of Oxford University has been found dead in the water off his private island home in Bermuda. The body of Dr James Martin – who gave £100million ($150million) to Oxford more than a decade ago – was found floating in the water of Agar’s Island in Hamilton Harbour on Monday by a kayaker. English-born Dr Martin, who was 79, became the author of more than 100 books and was a globally renowned speaker on the computer revolution after starting his career with computer giant IBM in the 1950s. Scroll down for video . The body of Dr James Martin, who gave £100million to Oxford University, was found floating in the waters of Bermuda on Monday by a kayaker. He is seen above at the Global Future 2045 Congress in New York on June 15 . Dr Martin amassed his fortune from his books - many of which became best sellers - associated videos and lecture tours . One of his books, 1978’s The Wired Society which predicted the internet revolution, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. Dr Martin was born in . Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, and attended Oxford’s Keble College before setting up several IT consultancy firms. He had lived in Bermuda for many years, bought Agar’s Island in 1997 with US-born third wife Lillian and turned it into his private sanctuary. The island home features a 300-year-old temple brought from Bali and incorporated features of the former British Army barracks and gunpowder store dating from the 19th century. Dr Martin, who amassed his fortune from his books (many of which became best sellers), associated videos and lecture tours, pledged £65million to Oxford in 2005 to set up a school to study the problems of the 21st century. Dr Martin wrote The Meaning Of The 21st Century: A Vital Blueprint For Ensuring Our Future, which was published in 2006 and featured interviews with prominent scientists, philosophers and politicians . In 2010, he offered another £35million in matching funds, which meant that for every £650,000 ($1million) pledged by another donor, he would match it with the same amount. According to an article in The Independent in 2011, he was inspired to set up what became the Oxford Martin School in the wake of 9/11. He told the Independent: ‘I was getting more and more concerned about the problems of the planet. ‘The idea behind the school was to say that all of these subjects needed research of a very high quality and on all of them there would have to be multi-disciplinary research. Yet there was almost no multi-disciplinary research going on in universities.’ He wrote The Meaning of the 21st Century: A Vital Blueprint for Ensuring Our Future, which was published in 2006 and featured interviews with prominent scientists, philosophers and politicians. The book was later made into a documentary, narrated by Bermuda neighbour and film star Michael Douglas. Despite his wealth, Dr Martin lived a quiet life but was prominent in local society and regularly delivered lectures on the island in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Staff at the Oxford Martin School have paid tribute to the entrepreneur.

He's usually a very savvy businessman, so Bernie Ecclestone might be surprised to learn that a classic Mercedes he sold six years ago for £300,000 has gone on sale today... for £1million. The F1 supremo parted company with his stunning 1955 Mercedes 300SL Gullwing in 2007 alongside a number of other cars from his famous collection. But the iconic sports car’s value has skyrocketed in recent years - leaving egg on the face of the 82-year-old billionaire. Bernie Ecclestone's iconic Mercedes 300SL Gullwing is on the market for £1million, which is £700,000 more than he sold it for . The F1 supremo parted company with his stunning 1955 Mercedes 300SL Gullwing in 2007 alongside a number of other cars from his famous collection . The iconic sports car's value has skyrocketed in recent years - leaving egg on the face of the 82-year-old billionaire . The car's now worth HOW much? Bernie Ecclestone . Hertfordshire-based DK Engineering bought the Gullwing last year and have treated it to a graphite grey bare-metal repaint. And apart from the paint job and some work to the interior, the car is pretty much as it was the day Mr Eccelstone accepted a £308,000 bid for it three years ago at RM Auctions’ London sale. Since then, the car has shot up in value, with DK Engineering now putting it back on the market with a £1million asking price - a 233 per cent increase. The 300 SL, nicknamed the Gullwing because of its famous doors, was built by Mercedes between 1955 and 1957. With a 3-litre engine developing 210bhp, the 140mph Mercedes was the world’s fastest production car of its day, with 1,400 built by the German manufacturer. The ex-Ecclestone car comes complete with its original ‘Rudge knock off wheels’ and has covered just 20,000 miles in its 58-year history. James Cottingham, vehicle acquisition consultant at DK Engineering, described the Gullwing as a 'really good example', adding £1million is 'where the market is at'. With a 3-litre engine developing 210bhp, the 140mph Mercedes was the world's fastest production car of its day, with 1,400 built by the German manufacturer . The 1950s' 300 SL Gullwing used brand new fuel-injection and weight-saving technology to achieve a mind-blowing top speed of 160mph, the fastest production car on Earth. At the time, the Gullwing retailed for $11,000 in America, meaning only the rich and famous could have one. It also ensured Mercedes was a premium brand from then on. Among Hollywood's elite, Clark Gable and Sophia Loren both owned one. He said: 'The car has matching chassis, engine and body numbers as well as the original Rudge Knock-off wheels. 'This is a great useable car with all . the right attributes: a good file, famous ownership, originality, low . mileage from new and a stunning colour combination.

Older sisters make better confidants than a parents, friends or relatives for teenage girls, a new study has found. In particular, adolescent girls going . through problems with romance, sex and other sensitive issues make . better choices when they have an older sister to confide in. Researchers from the University of . Missouri in America recorded conversations between volunteer family . members, talking about health, sex and their worries. Sisters like Kylie and Dannii Minogue are likely to have the same views and ideas, having grown up in the same environment, the study suggests . They found teenage girls were most open when discussing issues with an older sister while the older sister was the most useful in dispensing the right advice and guidance. In general girls tend to identify with other girls as they are most likely to have had the same types of experience, and so confide in them. However it may be easier with a sister than, for example, a friend, because they are likely to have the same views and ideas, having grown up in the same environment, the study suggests. In return, the older sister can give the best advice - whether it is about contraception to romantic feelings - because she will have been through it and made both right and wrong choices. The study, published in the specialist journal Family Relations, was led by Sarah Killoren, assistant professor of human development at Missouri University. She said: 'Our findings indicate that sisters play important roles as adolescent girls form ideas about romantic relationships and sexuality. It may be that Dakota Fanning acts as a role model to her younger sister Elle, who has also chosen to be an actress . 'Sisters are important communication partners when it comes to these sensitive topics.' The study suggests that older sisters should be included in family planning programmes aimed at teenagers, particular over issues like practicing safe sex. Conversations between sisters are more intimate and more likely to get to the root of an issue, said the researchers. Older sisters ask more pertinent questions, for instance, which in turn produces more revealing disclosures by the younger girl, they found. Additionally an older sister is much more likely to serve as a role model than a parent or friend, it added. Killoren said: 'Given their age, older sisters were more likely to have advice to share and have romantic relationships and sexual experiences from which their younger sisters can learn.' Having a role model also means learning from their mistakes, she added. 'Younger sisters frequently commented on their older sisters' negative experiences, such as teen pregnancy and abusive relationships, and made decisions to be different. 'Learning only from negative experiences could occur because younger sisters only consciously identify the experiences of their sisters that they do not want to repeat.'","Study by Missouri University was published in the journal Family Relations .

The parents of a 23-month-old boy fear their son could eat himself to death after being diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder which means he is constantly hungry. Geezer Buxton, is one of a handful of youngsters in the country to be diagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). It means the toddler, from Chesterton, Staffordshire, wants to eat anything he can get his hands on and has no ability to realise when he has had enough. Hungry: Geezer Buxton, is one of a handful of youngsters in the country to be diagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). The condition means he has no ability to realise when he has had enough to eat . Those suffering from PWS usually experience compulsive eating and an obsession with food usually begins before the age of six. As well as having an insatiable appetite, sufferers can also have slow physical and emotional development, as well as learning difficulties. The condition affects one in every 15,000 children born in England every year. Geezer - named after Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler - was diagnosed with PWS when he was three weeks old after doctors were concerned about him being floppy and unresponsive. Although he is making good progress, he is yet to utter his first word and has only recently started to crawl. Geezer’s parents Michelle Sargeant, 43, and Craig Buxton, 39, are concerned for their son’s future because he may never be able to live an independent life. Worried: Geezer with his mother Melanie. She said: 'If you saw him today, you would think he was a normal toddler, although he can't speak properly or stand due to his low muscle tone' Ms Sargeant said: 'When he was born I had to have a C-section, he was taken into intensive care and wouldn’t feed properly for ten days. 'He was fed through a tube before we were allowed to take him home.Around three weeks later we were given the diagnosis of PWS. 'If you saw him today, you would think he was a normal toddler, although he can’t speak properly or stand due to his low muscle tone. 'After finding out about his condition, I went online to speak to other parents regarding the condition, they told me their stories, such as having to lock foods away and their children eating strange things. 'That doesn’t happen with every child, it can happen, but it doesn’t mean it will, Geezer isn’t at that stage at the moment but we will have to keep a closer eye on him in the next year. Geezer's parents Michelle and Craig Buxton are concerned for their son¿s future because he may never be able to live an independent life . 'I can’t imagine him being unsupervised, . when he gets older he would need adult supervision all the time to . monitor his food because they need less calories due to the muscle tone . and them not burning as much as others. 'The condition can be a bit like Pica in some ways, which is publicised in the news where children eat absolutely anything at all. 'When he is older and he has friends and go out with them it will be hard for him but like I said hopefully there will be an adult with him at all times. Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic condition. It . causes a constant desire to eat, dangerous weight gain, restricted . growth, reduced muscle tone, learning disabilities and behavioural . problems. It affects on in every 15,000 children born in the UK. Children with the condition will eat three to six times more than other children and will still want more. There . is no cure but the condition itself is not life threatening. However, . people with the syndrome often develop obesity related conditions such . as type 2 diabetes and heart failure. “If he does begin to eat everything and anything, we will have to watch him like a hawk to control his weight, as it can be a very dangerous condition to have. 'It is a scary thought of him being on his own because he could one day eat so much that his stomach ruptures. He could eat himself to death. 'My other three children don’t have the condition so we do feel quite bad for them as we are spending most of our time with Geezer taking him to and from hospital. Mr Buxton, a self-employed barber, added: 'When he was born, he actually stopped breathing four times. He was also really floppy, he couldn’t even hold his neck or arms up. 'It was a really worrying time because the doctors didn’t know why this was happening. We were told he had a 50 per cent chance of surviving. 'They had to take a blood sample and when the results came back, we were told he had this rare syndrome. 'Although it is a genetic disorder, in most cases it is not hereditary so it can happen to anyone.' The couple are now fundraising for the PWS Association UK. Michelle, who works as a part-time nurse, added: 'With the continued research in genetics and PWS, we remain positive about the future and hope that our little boy will be able to lead a happy and healthy life.' A two-month-old Geezer with his brother Hendrix. Their mother said: . 'It is a scary thought of Geezer being on his own because he could one day eat so much that his stomach ruptures. He could eat himself to death' Relatives of other PWS sufferers have told how their loved-ones have dangerously over-eaten as a result of the disorder. In 2011 two-year-old Alfie Mazeika scoffed down an entire three-tiered wedding cake as it was about to be served at a reception in Durham. In June 2012, 20-stone Jade Hall needed round-the-clock care from her family in Cambridgeshire after almost binge-eating herself to death.

Tipping the scales at just four-and-a-half stone, 35-year-old anorexic Tricia Webb's life was in serious danger. But her 20-year battle against the eating disorder was given a boost when she adopted four Cavalier King Charles spaniels, which she says, gave her a reason to live. Now, she has turned her life around and has gained three stone - all thanks to the dogs, named Tyler, Bodie, Max and Sam. Recovery: Tricia Webb with her Cavalier King Charles spaniels (from left) Bodie, Sam and Max . Reason to live: Tricia says the dogs gave her a reason to carry on and wouldn't have made it without them . 'My dogs are my life - they brought me back from the dead,' explains the recovering anorexic who hails from Middlesbrough. 'Without their regular visits, and their compassion and love, I simply wouldn’t have made it. They were my goal from beginning to end - to see them and to stay alive for them.' Tricia, who has owned the dogs, all aged between seven and nine years old, even told concerned doctors that she knew she would pull through because of her cherished canines. 'When I was in hospital, the doctors would ask me ""what’s your goal or reason for recovery?"" I would always say ‘my dogs are my goal’.” Tricia now weighs seven stone and has been out of hospital for a year - the longest she has ever managed without an admission. Her illness began when she was a teenager and she started skipping meals while working busy shifts at a hair dressing salon. But the illness soon began to take a toll as her weight plummeted to six-and-a-half stone and her hair began falling out. Frightening: At her lowest point, Tricia was so thin and weak that she had to be hospitalised repeatedly . Faithful friends: Tricia says the dogs' love and compassion towards her made a huge difference to her life . Getting better: Tricia now weighs seven stone and hasn't been hospitalised for a year - a record for her . Her parents Cath, 64, and Keith, 66, took her to see their GP who said it was just a phase. But when the weight continued to drop off her already skeletal frame she was diagnosed with anorexia and admitted to hospital. 'I never intended not to eat. I just never felt hungry and I was so busy that I didn’t consider what it was doing to me,' reveals Tricia. 'I was never a typical anorexic because it wasn’t that I didn’t want to eat, I just forgot, and then it got to the point where I couldn’t eat. 'It wasn’t until I was admitted to hospital that I decided if everyone thought I was anorexic, I may as well act like it.' And act like it she did, with the result that her weight plummeted to less than five stone. And worse was to come. By now seriously ill, she collapsed in the snow one Christmas and broke her shoulder before being re-admitted to hospital. 'If I hadn’t broken my arm then I probably would have died, as I would never have willingly gone back to hospital,' she admits. But even that wasn't enough of a wake-up call and she endured three further relapses before checking herself into The Retreat rehab centre in York. At the clinic, she was given a private room and felt in control of her own recovery, both of which, she says, made a difference - but her dogs were her main inspiration. 'They were brought in to see me and each time they left they would put their noses up to the glass, spurring me on to get better.' 'I’ve had them since they were pups, and they are my babies. Whenever I have been low, it is my dogs that have helped me bounce back. 'I talk to them about my problems - and obviously I can trust them not to tell anyone!'Although one, Tyler, sadly died from cancer in August, Tricia says her recovery is continuing apace. 'I just need to remember that I have three others - and of course my parents - for support.'","Tricia Webb, 35, from Middlesbrough weighed four stone at her worst .

In a bid to stave off the hunger pangs, she would order tea, bread and butter, and cakes to be served to her at around 4pm in her sumptuous bedroom at her palatial Bedfordshire home, Woburn Abbey. Eventually, the duchess began to ask her friends to join her and in the process, turned indulging in an afternoon tea into a British tradition.","Served on the 31st floor and costs £29.50 or £40 with champagne .

And yes, ditch the booze. British model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a staunch supporter of James Duigan's Clean & Lean diet plan . Model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley met James several years ago and is such a fan that she penned the introduction to his book Clean & Lean: Flat Tummy Fast. Rosie said: 'James knows exactly how I want my body to look: lean, taut and strong, yet soft, curvy and feminine. 'What I've learned through working with James is that by focusing on creating a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things, faster than I ever thought possible.

The . relentless, low-level stress of everyday life can also add inches to . your waist. When we're frightened, angry, tense or worried our bodies become flooded with adrenalin and a stress hormone called cortisol. The adrenalin keeps us alert and focused, while the cortisol prepares our muscles for a 'fight-or-flight' response. Does stress leave you feeling fat? It also helps the body to release sugar into the bloodstream for instant energy. It's all part of a defence mechanism that allows the body to respond appropriately when faced with danger. While . this stress mechanism worked well for us when we were cavemen, . modern-day stress, caused by a relentlessly busy lifestyle, is really . bad for you. It makes . you fat, it wears out your immune system and it increases your risk of . serious illness. This is because many of the situations that cause . stress nowadays don't present the sort of physical danger that you need . to run away from. The . result is that fat-storing hormones - and the sugar they help to release . into the bloodstream - float around your system, eventually ending up . as fat on your tummy and around your waist. They also make you crave more sugar because your body thinks it needs more to keep going. As . stress levels subside, your adrenalin levels fall, but cortisol (and . the resulting blood sugar) stays in the system much longer. Research . shows that fat cells around the stomach attract cortisol, giving you a . layer of toxic fat just below your abdominal muscles that's really hard . to shift, so doing regular sit-ups is pointless if you always feel . stressed. And stomach . fat is the most dangerous type because it raises your risk of heart . disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and certain cancers. Constant stress also shuts down the digestive system because your body redirects blood from there to your muscles. So stress can leave you constipated, bloated and toxic. Beating stress is the only way to better health and a better body. From The Clean & Lean Diet by James Duigan .","Australian personal trainer to celebrities has made MailOnline video series .

A single protein can be used to distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from that which can be managed, scientists say. They hope the discovery will revolutionise treatment of the disease by showing early on whether patients face a deadly threat or can afford to wait and see how their condition progresses. Much higher levels of the protein, NAALADL2, were found in prostate tumour tissue than in healthy tissue. But the difference was especially marked in aggressive cancers and those already advancing around the body. Breakthrough: A single protein can be used to distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from that which can be managed. Scientists hope the discovery will revolutionise treatment of the disease . Studies of two independent patient groups confirmed that the protein can be used both to diagnose prostate cancer, and to single out those which need immediate hard-hitting treatment in the form of surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients with low levels of the protein were more likely to qualify for ‘watchful waiting’ monitoring, which simply involves keeping a close eye on how the disease progresses. Older men with very mild forms of prostate cancer are likely to die from other causes before even showing symptoms of the disease, making treatment unnecessary. Aggressive and tame forms of prostate cancer are popularly known as ‘tigers’ and ‘pussycats’ respectively. Currently, they are loosely identified by the Gleason score, an aggressiveness rating of one to 10 given to a cancer after a biopsy that involves the removal of prostate tissue. ‘Tigers’ are defined by a Gleason score of eight and above. Human prostate cancer cells. With the new test, much higher levels of the protein, NAALADL2, were found in prostate tumour tissue than in healthy tissue . NAALADL2 causes prostate cancer cells to behave in an aggressive tiger-like fashion, making them more likely to break out and invade healthy tissue, said the scientists. While a ‘tiger’ patient’s survival may depend on radical treatment, both surgery and radiotherapy can have serious after-effects, causing lifelong problems such as impotency and urinary incontinence. Lead scientist Dr Hayley Whitaker, from Cambridge University, said: ‘This is early research, but if clinical trials confirm our results then it could help clinicians to tell which patients have a more aggressive tumour and need proportionally aggressive treatment, while sparing patients with low grade tumours unnecessary radiotherapy or surgery. ‘This is an important step along the path to developing a much-sought after test that could distinguish between different types of prostate cancer.’ Each year around 41,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the UK and around 11,000 die from the disease. Professor Malcolm Mason, a prostate cancer expert from Cancer Research UK, which funded the research, said: ‘As a prostate cancer clinician, I have been waiting for years for a test that can define the aggressive disease. ‘I hope that this research brings forward the day when I can say to patients: “We know that your cancer doesn’t need treatment”- a crucial development that could spare thousands of patients from enduring arduous treatment with unpleasant side effects. ‘This extremely interesting study provides an important development for prostate cancer screening, and potentially even reveals a new target for the development of new prostate cancer drugs in the future.’ The study, conducted in collaboration with the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, is published in the journal Oncogene.","There are higher levels of the protein NAALADL2 in aggressive tumours .
Finding means doctors can identify those tumours that are likely to pose a deadly threat and which need to be tackled with intensive treatment .
Currently the aggressiveness of a tumour can only be loosely identified meaning some patients have debilitating treatment that is not necessary ."

But now Silvio Berlusconi is himself suing a gossip magazine for publishing another intimate collection of photos, taken at a similarly secluded Mediterranean villa. The billionaire politician is demanding £85,000 compensation from Oggi magazine for publishing compromising pictures of him embracing five young women at his villa in Sardinia. Chi, which forms a part of the former Italian premier's Mondadori publishing empire, last year printed no fewer than 27 pictures of Kate and William on their private holiday at a chateau in Provence. Silvio Berlusconi Italy's former Prime Minister owns the same magazine that printed semi-nude photos of the Duchess of Cambridge . The magazine, which has a usual weekly circulation of 340,000, hit Italian news stands last September, led by the sensationalist headline 'The Queen is naked'. At least 12 of the pictures showed the duchess semi-nude - including some not published in France. The magazine also published a tasteless article by a plastic surgeon assessing Kate's physique. Chi went to press in spite of Palace pleas for restraint and even though legal action against the French magazine Closer, which first published the pictures, had already begun. At the time the royal couple issued a statement saying they were 'shocked and saddened' by the intrusion. Privately William was said to be 'furious' particularly as it was not the first time the magazine had him grief. In 2006 Chi had published near-death pictures of Princess Diana. Now in an astonishing display of hypocrisy the former Italian premier is now demanding compensation for the collection of pictures at his luxurious Sardinian home Villa Certosa, which he says unfairly described him as having 'a harem' of women around him. The photos were taken at Berlusconi's villa 'Villa Certosa' in Sardinia . The pictures, which showed the then Prime Minister caressing multiple young women, were printed in the weekly magazine in April 2007, before the other sex scandals involving Berlusconi broke. The editor at-the-time Pino Belleri could face up to 17 months in prison on charges of a breach of privacy. However defence lawyers told a Milan court on Friday that the editor had acted 'in the public interest' by printing the pictures. She added that Berlusconi's daughter Marina, president of his Mondadori publishing arm, had also been acting 'in the public interest' when Chi printed the intimate photographs of Kate. The verdict is expected on March 1. Meanwhile the photographer Antonello Zappadu is facing justice in a separate trial in Sardinia for breaking and entering and breach of privacy.","Billionaire playboy is demanding £85,000 compensation from Oggi magazine .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:31 EST, 13 October 2011 . A cargo ship which spilled hundreds of tons of oil remained perched on a New Zealand reef today, as locals descended on a nearby beach to scavenge from the vessel's washed-up load. Salvage crews are still debating whether the remaining fuel on the Liberian-flagged Rena can be pumped from the ship before it breaks up. And as rescue crews tried to stabilise the ship, local residents in Tauranga, New Zealand, have been spotted inspecting the containers of cargo and surveying the disaster from the shore. Assessing the damage: Two residents walk along the beach inspecting the washed-up cargo from the Rena vessel in Taurange, New Zealand today . Surveying the scene: More locals flock to the shore where containers from the Rena washed up . Further inspection of the washed-up cargo showed the beach littered with thousands of part-cooked meat patties from one of the Rena's containers . But anyone hoping for a valuable haul from the stricken vessel would have turned up disappointed - as the Rena mainly shed thousands of partly-cooked burgers on to the sand. The ship itself is being slowly battered to pieces by pounding waves, with rescuers needing to stabilise the Rena before any oil transfer can start. Environmentalists have warned of a disaster for wildlife if all the ship's 1,870 tons (1,700 metric tons) of oil and 220 tons (200 metric tons) of diesel is allowed to spill into the ocean. Crews attempting to start the salvage effort have also been hampered by the severe structural damage sustained on the vessel. Other items from the containers washed up in Tauranga, New Zealand included these deer skins . As another container washed up on the beach at Mt Maunganui, New Zealand, rescuers were trying to get near the vessel to transfer away its oil . Meanwhile, several of the 88 containers that have fallen off its deck had washed ashore by Thursday, and authorities confirmed one container that toppled overboard contained a hazardous substance. However, an official said it should not pose a major threat. Heavy seas had kept salvage crews away from the 775-foot (236-meter) vessel for days, but a break in the weather allowed three team members to be winched aboard the Liberian-flagged Rena, which ran aground Oct 5 on Astrolabe Reef, 14 miles (22 kilometers) from Tauranga Harbour on New Zealand's North Island. Clean up: Soldiers work to clear away the oil spill from the beach in Taurange, New Zealand, as environmentalists warned of a potential wildlife disaster . In trouble: Rescuers have been unable to properly reach the ship due to the severe structural damage it has suffered . Mystery: Investigators have so been unable to explain how the vessel managed to perch itself on the New Zealand reef, as the ship remains in danger of spilling more oil and containers . Ewart Barnsley, spokesman for Maritime New Zealand which is managing the emergency response, said the salvage crew found oil hoses and pumps for transferring fuel largely undamaged aboard the ship. They also concluded that the ship was safe to work from. Barnsley said a barge was moored nearby to receive oil, but a decision on when that transfer might start would not be made before Friday. Marine New Zealand salvage manager Bruce Anderson said the vessel needed to stop moving before the oil could be pumped out and it apparently had. 'While this is good news, we shouldn't get too excited,' Anderson told reporters. 'We already had a complex project to start with; it's even harder now that we've sustained damage aboard this vessel,' he said, referring to recent structural cracking. A vertical crack in the ship runs around the entire vessel - meaning the ship is now only held together by its internal components, said Steve Jones, another spokesman for Maritime New Zealand. 'The reality is the vessel could break up at any point,' Jones told The Associated Press. Six vessels have been mobilized to intercept the drifting containers and other debris in the water. There were 1,368 containers on board, 11 of which contained hazardous substances, Maritime New Zealand said. One of the hazardous containers is among those that have fallen overboard, Jones said. Agency spokesman Nick Bohm said the . container held alkyl sulfonic acid, which can be harmful in its original . state, but becomes less toxic when diluted with water. The whereabouts . of that container are unknown. Some . of the contents of containers that had washed ashore were strewn across . the coastline on Thursday, including thousands of meat patties that . littered the sand. The . ship's 44-year-old Filipino captain was charged Wednesday with operating . a vessel in a manner causing unnecessary danger or risk and was . released on bail Wednesday at Tauranga District Court. Potential disaster: An aerial view of the stranded cargo vessel Rena shows the boat listing to one side and patches of oil leaking from its storage tanks . Clean-up: A shag covered in oil is helped by wildlife veterinarian Dr Brett Gartrell and Aimee Forster at the wildlife rehabilitation facility in Tauranga, New Zealand . Concern: The size of the oil spill from the Rena can clearly been seen in this image . The ship's second officer appeared in the same court Thursday on the same charge. Judge Robert Wolff made orders suppressing publication of the defendants' names for the sake of their personal safety. If convicted, each could face a fine of up to 10,000 New Zealand dollars ($7,800) and 12 months in prison. Their next court appearance is Oct. 19, when authorities say more charges are likely. The government has demanded to know why the ship crashed into the well-charted reef in calm weather, but the vessel's owner, Greece-based Costamare Inc., has given no explanation. On Thursday, Costamare released a statement apologizing for the incident and said it was investigating how the ship could have run aground.","Thousands of burger patties litter beach in Tauranga, New Zealand .

Militants in Gaza launched a barrage of rockets at Israel early this morning as the deadliest attack against Israelis in three years threatened to escalate. Israeli aircraft had responded to yesterday's attack, in which eight people died, by striking targets in the Palestinian territory. Yesterday, gunmen who appear to have originated in Gaza crossed into southern Israel through the Egyptian desert and ambushed civilian vehicles traveling on a remote road in southern Israel. Rockets fired: Members of an Israeli bomb squad carry the remains of a rocket that was fired from the Gaza Strip into the coastal city of Ashdod in Israel this morning . Airstrikes: A plume of smoke rises above Gaza City as Israeli missiles hit in the hours after attacks by militants near Eilat, Southern Israel . Injured: Palestinians carry two wounded wounded boys into Al-Shifa hospital following the Israeli air attacks on Gaza City . Six of those killed were civilians and two were members of Israeli security forces responding to the incursion. The attack signaled a new danger for . Israel from its border with the Sinai Peninsula, which had long remained . quiet under the rule of deposed Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak. Mubarak was ousted in February and . since then the desert of the Sinai Peninsula - largely controlled by . Bedouin tribes - has become increasingly lawless. Hours after the initial attack Israel . responded with an airstrike that killed five members of the Palestinian . group that Israel said was behind the incursion, an organisation known . as the Popular Resistance Committees. The dead included the group's . leader. A spokesman for the group, Abu . Mujahid, would not confirm or deny responsibility for the attack inside . Israel, but said militants would avenge the killing of the men in Gaza. Warnings: Flares fired by the Israeli Army can be seen in the sky above the Israeli village of Elot near the southern city of Eilat . Innocent victims: Palestinians carry a wounded girl into Al-Shifa hospital following Israeli air attacks on Gaza City .

Damage: An Israeli policeman and an Ultra Orthodox Jewish man inspect the damage to a synagogue caused by a Grad rocket launched from Gaza Strip . Scroll savers: Ultra Orthodox Jews evacuate Torah scrolls from a synagogue that was damaged following a Grad rocket attack from the Gaza Strip in Ashdod . Hamas denied any connection with the . attacks, but hurriedly evacuated all of its security facilities . yesterday in anticipation of more Israeli retaliation. Those strikes . continued through the night, targeting what the military said were . smuggling tunnels and sites used by gunmen. Hamas officials said two children, aged 3 and 13, were killed in the Israeli strikes. The Israeli military's chief . spokesman, Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, said it was 'too early' to say . that a broad escalation in Gaza was imminent. 'If we see that Hamas is choosing to . escalate, we will not hesitate to expand the scope of our actions, . respond in strength and exact a price from Hamas,' he told Army Radio . this morning. Militants in Gaza launched at least 10 rockets into Israel today, the military said. One, aimed at the city of Ashkelon, . was intercepted by the new Israeli anti-missile system known as Iron . Dome. Another hit the port city of Ashdod and wounded six Israelis, . according to Israeli emergency services. Israel's south has been equipped with . early warning systems and bomb shelters over years of rocket fire from . Gaza, and those measures have helped keep casualties low. The attacks focused Israel's . attention on its border with Egypt - 125 miles of mountainous desert . with no fence for most of its length. The border has traditionally been . crossed mainly by Bedouin smugglers ferrying drugs and thousands of . African asylum-seekers into Israel. Yesterday's attack - the deadliest . for Israel since a Palestinian gunman killed eight people in a Jerusalem . religious seminary in 2008 - took place near Israel's popular Red Sea . resort city of Eilat, currently at the height of the tourist season. Some 20,000 British tourists visit  Eilat each year. The last terror attack there was in 2007. Though the desert outside Eilat . showed signs of an increased military presence on Friday morning, the . city itself appeared unaffected. Joggers and cyclists were visible along . the beach. Resident Zion Cohen, 53, said the . steady stream of African migrants crossing the border with ease in . recent years showed that an incursion like the one on yesterday was only . a matter of time. 'What bothers me is the unbearable . ease with which they cross the border and the knowledge that... every . day, every minute and every hour something can happen like yesterday,' said Cohen said. A new fence is currently under construction, and the military says it will be complete by the end of 2012. Emergencies: A Palestinian man carries an injured woman into Al-Shifa hospital . Burned out: The shell of a bus lies at the side of a road leading to Eilat, Israel, following yesterday's bloody day of attacks . In hot pursuit: Israeli Police and Special Forces made arrests in connection with the attacks . Yesterday's attacks began after . midday when a bus carrying civilians and soldiers was attacked by gunmen . who had crossed into southern Israel from Egypt. Over three hours, the militants, . disguised in Israeli army uniforms, attacked two buses and civilian . cars. An army patrol was also targeted.

China has accused European workers of being ‘slothful’ and ‘indolent’ after refusing to put any of its vast resources into rescuing the euro. The head of the Chinese state’s overseas investment arm said he would only help Europe if it reformed its ‘outdated’ labour laws and welfare systems. Jin Liqun, chairman of the board of supervisors of China Investment Corporation, said Europeans should stop ‘languishing on the beach’ and work harder it they want to drag the eurozone out of its downward spiral. And he said Europeans have become too reliant on state handouts and should stop looking to outside sources to tackle the debt crisis threatening the euro. The broadside will deal yet another blow to Europe’s efforts to prevent the crisis in Greece from tearing apart the single currency. At last week’s G20 summit of the world’s largest economies in Cannes, China rebuffed requests to put its financial might behind a comprehensive rescue plan to shore up the debt-laden countries on the eurozone’s periphery. European leaders had hoped the world’s second largest economy would help underwrite a significant expansion of its £380billion bailout fund. But Mr Jin scotched any prospect of China coming to their aid with a candid critique of European working practices. In an interview on the Al Jazeera TV station, he said: ‘I think if you look at the troubles which have happened in European countries, this is purely because of the accumulated troubles of their worn-out welfare societies. ‘Labour laws are outdated, the labour laws induce sloth, indolence rather than hard working. The incentive system is totally out of whack.’ Mr Jin, a Boston University graduate, said root-and-branch reform of European welfare systems was urgently required. Mr Jin said generous safety nets discourage the unemployed from finding full-time work . Generous safety nets merely discouraged workers who have lost their jobs from finding full-time employment. He said: ‘The welfare system is good for any society to reduce the gap, to help those who happen to have disadvantages, to enjoy a good life, but a welfare society should not induce people not to work hard. ‘If you look at the European countries over the last five or six decades, you will find this system will have to be adjusted.’ Huge discrepancies in social welfare systems were an obstacle to fostering the closer ties between eurozone members that many economists believe are the only long-term solution to the crisis. Mr Jin said: ‘Why should for instance, within eurozone, why should some members’ people have to work to 65, even longer, whereas in some other countries they are happily retiring at 55, languishing on the beach. This is unfair.’",Jin Liqun said Europeans should stop 'languishing on the beach' and work harder .

She said: ‘It all started with a small dose .  .  . It affected how I looked and how I felt. I couldn’t stop thinking about it.’ In the last seconds of the advert, she livens up and begins talking about the product, which is used by former X Factor star Cheryl Cole. She is shown applying it to her arms, before saying: ‘It was the perfect daily moisturiser. It’s so light and smells great .  .  . I was hooked.’ The last shot shows samples of the cream, which retails for about £5.49, and the slogan: ‘You’ll be hooked.’ The advert was pulled hours after we revealed it had prompted more than 60 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority as well as criticism on social networking sites, including Twitter. Trivial: Viewers complained about the advert as being 'offensive' to people struggling with addiction . One person wrote: ‘What idiot decided that likening E45 to being a drug addict was good marketing? Disgusting!!’ Another added: ‘What completely misjudged, misguided ad content from E45 cream.’ A third viewer Tweeted: ‘Comparing moisturising lotion to serious drug addiction? Big NO.’ Drug charities were among those who said the advert trivialised the problems facing addicts. A spokeswoman for E45 said the company was sorry for any offence caused and insisted it had not gone out of its way to court controversy. ‘We were unaware anyone had complained to the ASA until we saw it in The Mail on Sunday,’ she said. ‘E45 is not a brand that sets out to shock.’ Bestseller: E45 body lotion is a market leader .","Advert featured a thin, pale-looking woman talking about being 'hooked'

David Cameron, pictured at the Golden temple in Amritsar, described the killings as 'monstrous' but did not make a formal apology . It is 5.15pm on Sunday, April 13, 1919, in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar in the Punjab. An open-topped motorcar pulls up near the Jallianwala Bagh, a seven-acre area of waste ground, and Brigadier Reginald ‘Rex’ Dyer steps out. He then attempts to bring an armoured car, with its machine gun, into the area, but is foiled because the street is too narrow. No matter, he orders his force of Indian and Gurkha troops to open fire into a peaceful crowd of local men, women and children who are listening to Gandhian speeches about non-violence. The shooting continues until the ammunition runs out and, in the words of the memorial there, the ground is ‘saturated with the blood of about 2,000 Indian patriots’. Then he calmly goes back to his headquarters, triumphantly successful in his premeditated plan to murder innocents in the name of the British Raj. That is the popular view of the Amritsar Massacre, sedulously promoted by the 1982 movie Gandhi and the one taught in India and in British schools today. It is the story of the vicious British Empire yet again killing thousands, out of what has been described as ‘imperial terrorism’. In 2005, in reviews of a biography of Dyer entitled The Butcher Of Amritsar, the massacre was variously described as ‘an unforgivable atrocity’, ‘state terrorism’, ‘a heinous crime’ and ‘the biggest and bloodiest blot on the generally benign record of British rule in India’. Yet the true story of what happened that day in Amritsar is far more nuanced and David Cameron, at the end of his trip to India last week, was quite right not to make a formal apology for it, merely reiterating what Winston Churchill correctly said at the time, that it was ‘monstrous’. For everything stated in my opening paragraphs above is either completely wrong or was certainly not what it seemed. In fact, according to a superb book called The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story Of One Fateful Day, by Nick Lloyd, a lecturer in defence studies at King’s College, London, which was published last year, it turns out that Dyer had no plans at all to commit a massacre, and that when he arrived he was expecting a much smaller crowd than the 25,000 who were present. He panicked when he realised his force of 90 men – including 40 without rifles – were outnumbered by 275 to one. ‘I realised that my force was small and to hesitate might induce attack,’ he later explained. ‘I immediately opened fire and dispersed the crowd.’ Anti-British feeling was at its highest since the Indian Mutiny in 1857. Only days earlier, huge mobs had killed five Europeans and as Lloyd remarks of the attacks elsewhere in the Punjab: ‘Far from being peaceful crowds, many of the rioters were armed with lathis [metal-tipped sticks], bill hooks and various other weapons, including swords and kerosene oil, which was used to burn government buildings.’ Brutal: A painting of British soldiers shooting civilians in Amritsar on April 13, 1919 . If a revolt had caught fire in the . Punjab, it would have led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Indians . from all the main communities. As the half-million or so who died there . during Partition in 1947-48 remind us, the Punjab was a sectarian . tinderbox. In that context, 379 deaths – the casualty figure always maintained by the British – might be monstrous, as the PM has rightly said,  but it nipped in the bud something that could have been calamitous. At that point, the British in Amritsar had only 75 armed and 100 unarmed constables with whom to control a city of 150,000 inhabitants. 'Distraught': Brigadier Reginald Dyer was in charge of British troops and ordered the massacre in Amritsar . Three days before the massacre, a mob had gone on a rampage in the city and three bank officials were lynched in their offices, their corpses burnt in the street. Two other officials were murdered, and an elderly female  missionary, Miss Sherwood, was hauled off her bicycle, beaten to the ground and left for dead. Posters appeared which alleged that the British raped Indian girls in Amritsar and urged Indians to ‘dishonour’ and ‘clear the country of all English ladies’. Dyer feared that it might take little for ‘peaceful’ crowds such as the one in the Jallianwala Bagh – which was overwhelmingly made up of young men – to turn violent. Had Dyer premeditated a massacre, he would have brought more than 50 riflemen with him. Although the Jallianwala Bagh crowd had no firearms, many did have lathis and a concerted rush, which Dyer’s staff officer Captain Tommy Briggs feared might happen, could have spelt disaster. Nor is it true that Dyer wanted to use a machine gun but could not get it into the Jallianwala Bagh, as the myth-makers still insist. In fact, there was a Vickers machine gun in the armoured car that he knew he could have simply detached from its stand, since it was designed for dismounted use. Nor did Dyer use more than a fraction of the ammunition he brought with him: 1,650 rounds out of 9,000. What makes Dyer’s over-reaction understandable was his often-repeated warnings throughout the morning of April 13 that no demonstration could take place in a city that was declared to be under martial law, and that ‘all gatherings will be fired upon’. This proclamation was made three times in Urdu and Punjabi – languages understood by 90 per cent of the city’s inhabitants – at no fewer than 19 places by Dyer and a detachment of Indian and British troops. As they marched through the city, Dyer was spat upon by ‘bored, sullen and hostile’ groups of youths, who some of the troops felt were ‘so hostile that violence could have broken out at any moment’. Having never been to the Jallianwala Bagh before, Dyer did not know that it was walled in on three sides by the backs of houses, with a low wall on the far side. His view was further impeded by the dust thrown up by the 25,000 people present. ‘Dyer came to me all dazed and shaken up,’ a British administrator later recalled of that evening, ‘and said, “I never knew there was no way out.” ’ Accepted version: The depiction of the mass killings at Amritsar in the 1982 Oscar-winning film Gandhi . Massacre: British soldiers opened fire on around 25,000 peaceful protestors close to the Golden Temple in Amritsar . Although Dyer later claimed to have . undertaken the massacre to ‘save’ British India, Lloyd convincingly . explains that he had had no such idea in his mind that fateful . afternoon. As well as being ‘dazed and shaken up’ – hardly the response . of a soldier who had had murder in his mind – all the witnesses recall . how Dyer ‘was unnerved and deeply upset about what had happened’. One witness described him as ‘distraught’, and he told a friend six months afterwards: ‘I haven’t had a night’s sleep since that happened. I keep on seeing it over again.’ Gunfire: A painting depicts the moment around 50 British riflemen fired 1,650 rounds into a crown of Indian protestors . The Indian estimates of the number of the dead are wildly exaggerated, although Lloyd believes that the number given by the Hunter Inquiry of 379 is probably too low by 35 or so. It was certainly not in the ‘thousands’, however. And despite the depictment in the movie Gandhi, there were very few women and children present. A deputation of Indian merchants and shopkeepers soon after the massacre actually thanked Dyer for preventing looting, and he received many other such tokens of gratitude; the guardians of the Golden Temple invested him there as an honorary Sikh. If one wants to find examples of large-scale killing going on in Amritsar in the 20th Century, one might also look at Indira Gandhi’s 1984 storming of the Golden Temple, in which as many as 1,000 died. Because that was a massacre of Indians by Indians, it did not attain the condemnation that has attended Brigadier Dyer. So whose fault was this undeniable tragedy? Ultimately, of course, Dyer must take the blame for giving the order to fire, but the organisers of the banned meeting must share some of it too. They knew how febrile the atmosphere was, and had heard Dyer’s order not to congregate. Yet trusting in their non-violent saintliness, the Congress Party still called together a crowd of 25,000 people for a demonstration they knew to be extremely provocative. They irresponsibly and, in the event, suicidally went ahead, putting propaganda and politics before people’s lives. Instead of being criticised for their recklessness, the organisers have been hailed as heroes, while Dyer has been demonised.

She told police she thought she was driving in the opposite direction . He is an expert in alcohol and drug abuse and a leading light in the campaign to introduce a minimum price per unit. So when Dr Stefan Janikiewicz’s daughter was hauled before the courts for driving the wrong way down a motorway while drunk he had more reason that most to be embarrassed. ‘The irony is not lost on me,’ the clinical director for drug and alcohol services within Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Trust said. His daughter Stefanie, 25, had been on a cocktail and wine binge and was nearly three times the limit when she drove for seven miles along the hard shoulder. When she was eventually stopped she stunned police by saying she thought she was travelling in completely the opposite direction. She could have faced up to two years behind bars after admitting charges of dangerous driving and drink driving. On Wednesday, at Preston Crown Court, the teacher, from Thurstaston on the Wirral, escaped with a six-month sentence suspended for 18 months. Judge Anthony Russell QC – who controversially gave paedophile TV presenter Stuart Hall a 15-month prison term for sex offences – said she could go free because she was a popular teacher with a previously impeccable character. She was banned from driving for two years and ordered to pay £350 costs. Dr Janikiewicz, 64, who is also an expert in substance misuse at the Royal College of General Practitioners in North West England, was the first GP to head up a major drug treatment unit in England. He has been an ardent campaigner for the introduction of a minimum price per unit of alcohol. Yesterday he said: ‘The last few weeks have been dreadful, but much more so as a father. ‘My wife and I have eight children so I suppose statistically an awful situation would arise in some area, and it was in the field where I am meant to be an expert and I have not been able to reinforce that on my own children. ‘But it has not changed the advice I give, it has only served to reinforce it.’ The incident occurred in May after Miss Janikiewicz travelled from London to Manchester and had been drinking on the train. She then went for an evening meal with her sister and drank more alcohol before setting off in her Nissan Micra to speak with her ex-boyfriend in Liverpool. However she ended up heading 55 miles in the opposite direction, towards Blackpool, on the wrong side of the carriageway. She was spotted travelling at a walking pace along the M55 by concerned motorists. Miss Janikiewicz drove on the hard shoulder for almost 40 minutes. Her father has campaigned for the introduction of a minimum price per unit of alcohol. He said his daughter's actions has 'not changed the advice I give, it has only served to reinforce it' Much of Miss Janikiewicz’s 38-minute journey was along the hard shoulder and she admitted having had so much to drink she could not remember what she had done. The court heard Miss Janikiewicz works for a charity called Teach First, which trains graduates to work in deprived areas. Carole Whittingham, of the Campaign Against Drink Driving, said: ‘This woman is a role model to young people. What sort of message does the sentence send?’ Dr Janikiewicz said: ‘As parents you love your children to such a degree you will support them no matter what. But… it was absolutely abhorrent on her part and I regret it, she regrets it. Her remorse is total.’","Stefanie Janikiewicz, 25, was nearly three times the legal limit .

An astonishing confrontation on live TV  between Andrew Neil and a shouting U.S. conspiracy theorist saw the veteran broadcaster label him an ‘idiot’ and ‘the worst person I've ever interviewed’. U.S. radio host Alex Jones was on BBC One’s Sunday Politics with journalist David Aaronovitch to discuss the secretive Bilderberg Conference, which has been taking place over the past week. But Mr Jones, 39, launched into a noisy rant about the theories available on his website about the U.S. government ‘disappearing people’, which led to him eventually being cut off by Mr Neil, 64. Scroll down for video . Confrontation: U.S. radio host Alex Jones (right) was on BBC One’s Sunday Politics with Andrew Neil (left) to discuss the secretive Bilderberg Conference, which has been taking place over the past week near Watford . Mr Neil told him: 'You (Mr Jones) are the worst person I've ever interviewed. David (Aaronovitch), thank you for being with us. It's gone half past 11. You're watching the Sunday Politics.' The presenter then added: ‘We have an idiot on the programme today’, before using hand gestures to indicate that Mr Jones had lost his mind, as the American continued to shout at him off camera. Mr Jones had said: ‘Hey listen, I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game. Our government, the US, is building Fema (Federal Emergency Management Agency) camps. ‘We have an NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act) where they disappear people now.

Mr Jones had already told the programme that the creation of the Euro was a 'Nazi German plan' and said Bilderberg is 'heavily involved in the EU plan'. He added: ‘We have forced them from cover to admit they’re puppeteers above the major parties. Mr Neil later said on Twitter: 'The moment Alex Jones knew he was no longer on air he stopped.' The shouting at the end of the show - which was criticised as 'all an act' by Mr Neil - was immediately labelled 'spectacular' by the Mail's James Chapman and 'TV gold' by the political blog Guido Fawkes. The Bilderberg Conference is an international group of politicians, business leaders and academics who meet behind closed doors - this year at a luxury country hotel near Watford, Hertfordshire. Piers Morgan is another British broadcaster to have felt the roar of Alex Jones in a live TV interview. Mr Morgan, 48, brought the radio talk show host onto his CNN show in January to explain why he thought the journalist should be banned from the U.S. for his views on gun control. The topic had been the focus of Mr Morgan's prime-time shows for a period following the December 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Mr Jones, however, spent nearly all of the time screaming at Mr Morgan at the top of his lungs, calling him a 'redcoat foreigner' and threatening revolution if anyone tried to 'take our guns.' Mr Morgan later wrote about the confrontation in the Mail On Sunday, saying Mr Jones was 'ranting and raving like a gorilla at the zoo who’s just seen the morning bucket of bananas arrive'.

Proceedings: Both prosecutions were brought by Attorney General Dominic Grieve (pictured) A juror dropped from the trial of an alleged sex offender after posting on Facebook that he wanted to ‘F*** up a paedophile’ was today jailed for two months for contempt of court. Kasim Davey, 21, of Palmers Green, north London, said there was ‘a lot of Jimmy Savile news at the time’ and he wrote the message as a result of ‘spontaneous surprise at the kind of case I was on’. Meanwhile Joseph Beard, 29, was also jailed for two months for contempt after using the internet to research the case he was sitting on as a juror at Kingston Crown Court in Surrey. Both men must serve half of their sentences behind bars. The men were sentenced at the High Court in central London for conduct likely to interfere with the administration of justice, after prosecutions brought by Attorney General Dominic Grieve. Davey had posted: ‘Woooow (sic), I wasn't expecting to be in a jury deciding a paedophile's fate - I've always wanted to f*** up a paedophile and now I'm within the law!’ A judge at Wood Green Crown Court was alerted and Davey was discharged last December from the retrial of Adam Kephalas, who was later convicted of sexual activity with a child. Beard was found to be guilty of contempt by using the internet to research the case he was on. The jury was trying two men accused of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering last year. The trial started on October 2 but ended on November 9 when the jury was discharged after his activities came to light. He is alleged to have done research via . Google which turned up extra information about the victims to the . alleged fraud, and then to have told fellow jurors about it. Hearings: Kasim Davey and Joseph Beard were sentenced at the High Court (pictured) in central London for conduct likely to interfere with the administration of justice . The defendants in the original trial, Ian Macdonald and David Downes, faced a retrial and were convicted in March. They were jailed for eight and four-and-a-half years respectively on April 18. Beard told the court he had no intention to cause disruption to the trial process, or to investigate the case online. He said he only wanted to find out how long the trial would take as he was worried that it would drag on, affecting his job and his family life. Last week, Davey appeared before Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen's Bench Division, and Mr Justice Sweeney at London's High Court as the Attorney General appeared in person to call for his committal to prison. Sir John announced in the case of Davey that the court was sure he ‘did an act which created a real risk of interference with the administration of justice, and it was specifically intended by him to interfere with the administration of justice’. The court had reached the same conclusion in the case of Beard. In a postscript to the judgment, Sir . John said that ‘every attempt is made to try and warn jurors not to use . the internet or social sites for any purpose in relation to the case’. He . added: ‘However, as is also clear, the language used is not consistent, . giving room for argument of the type advanced before us as to what a . juror might understand was prohibited.’ Trial: A judge at Wood Green Crown Court (pictured) was alerted to Davey's post and he was discharged last December from the retrial of Adam Kephalas, who was later convicted of sexual activity with a child . Sir John said: ‘Many judges have adopted the practice not only of warning the jury in terms similar to what the judges in these two cases did, but also handing the jury a notice setting out what they must and must not do, and the penal consequences of any breach. ‘They have done this so that no juror can subsequently claim that he or she did not understand what they should not do and what the consequences might be.’ Sir John said that after Davey was . discharged as a juror, the judge told the jury ‘in very sweeping terms . that they should not use the internet’. 'Woooow, I wasn't expecting to be in a jury deciding a paedophile's fate - I've always wanted to f*** up a paedophile and now I'm within the law!' Kasim Davey . He added: ‘We can quite understand why he did this, but as Lord Carlile QC (for Davey) pointed out, what he said went beyond what would be permissible under Articles 8 and 10, quite apart from imposing restrictions on jurors properly carrying out day to day tasks which cannot be easily done without use of the internet.’ The judge said the court proposed to invite the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee in consultation with the Judicial College to ‘review the terminology used in the material given to the jury’ and to consider whether to recommend that the practice of handing out a notice as well as the warning ‘should be universally followed’. After both men were sentenced to two months’ imprisonment, the Attorney General said: ‘Jurors who use the internet to research a case undermine justice. ‘It creates a risk that the defendant will be convicted or acquitted, not on the evidence, but on unchallenged and untested material discovered by the juror. ‘Equally, the case of Kasim Davey shows that jurors must follow the directions given to them by the trial judge not to discuss the case outside the jury room, including discussions and posts on the internet.’","Kasim Davey, 21, of London said there was 'lots of Savile news at the time'

Behind Margaret Thatcher’s public shield of unyielding confidence there was one area of private doubt: what kind of mother had she been? She had no misgivings about making her twins Mark and Carol, born when she was 27, fit in with her professional and political life. They slept in the nanny’s room from the day they were brought home. As Lady Thatcher said in her 1996 memoir The Path To Power: ‘To be a mother and housewife is a vocation of a very high kind. But I simply felt that it was not the whole of my vocation. I knew that I also wanted a career.’ Family time: Baroness Margaret Thatcher with Sir Denis Thatcher and children Mark and Carol in 1959 . Countless women with ambition go through the same emotional wringer. As things turned out, she doted on Mark, the elder by two minutes, but developed an awkward relationship with the more independent Carol. Mark ended up with a fortune, widely perceived to have come about simply because he was Margaret Thatcher’s much-loved son. But there is plenty of evidence to show that even though she wasn’t as close to Carol, she loved and cared for her every bit as much, especially in her desire to see her married — a dream that was never fulfilled. According to one friend, the difference in her maternal relationships with her children — born in 1953 when she was a barrister, six years before she entered Parliament — was that she ‘calculated that Carol was tougher than Mark and therefore needed less of a push’. The root of journalist Carol’s uneasy relationship with her mother was her dismay, held since early childhood, that Mark was the favourite. ‘As a child I was frightened of her,’ she has said. ‘I always felt I came second of the two. Unloved is not the right word, but I never felt I made the grade.’ Leisure time: Margaret Thatcher playing the piano for husband Denis and their seventeen year-old twins children Mark and Carol in 1970 . In the mid-Nineties, when Carol was 43 and Mark was married to his first wife Diane and living with their children in South Africa, Carol let out her feelings of frustration and inadequacy. ‘Mark is married to a beautiful girl, has two fabulous children and various mansions scattered around the world. ‘I’m an ancient spinster of no fixed abode living in a rented holiday flat in a ski resort. I still don’t measure up awfully well on the Richter scale.’ A lifetime of frustration is encompassed in this outpouring. And it is hard not to conclude the blame for this must lie with Mrs Thatcher. As the late Tory grandee Woodrow Wyatt noted: ‘A different note comes into her (Thatcher’s) voice when she speaks about Mark. She obviously dotes on him.’ The result, perhaps, was inevitable — a daughter who felt second best. Margaret and businessman Denis had been married for two years when the twins (only one child was expected) were born while their father was watching cricket at the Oval. Becoming leader: The Thatchers strolling through the grounds of Scotney Castle in Kent where they were tenants of a National Trust flat in 1979 . With their parents working — Margaret was attached to legal chambers in Lincoln’s Inn and Denis travelled a lot — the babies were put into the care of a full-time nanny. Somewhat bitterly, Carol noted in her memoir: ‘I don’t think they (her parents) can have relished being in charge on nanny’s day off.’ The twins were five in 1958 when Mrs Thatcher was adopted as the Conservative candidate for Finchley, the safe North London constituency she would win the following year and represent until leaving Parliament in 1992. So was Mark and Carol’s childhood really as sterile as has been made out? Far from it. There were riding lessons and skiing holidays, and their mother established a lifelong rule about family weekends. As Sir Bernard Ingham, her No 10 private secretary, recalls: ‘She’d often say “weekends are for the family” and would never disturb me unless there was a running crisis.’ Years later, Mrs Thatcher, who had grown up in a ‘frugal and very purposeful household’ above her father’s grocer’s shop in Grantham, Lincs, told the adult Carol she’d wanted her children ‘to have the opportunities I hadn’t had’. Proud parents: Margaret and Denis Thatcher at the Savoy Hotel for their son Mark's wedding . As Carol recalled: ‘When it came to being a mother, she [gave] Mark and me the opportunity to make up our own minds. That meant anything from being allowed to choose the wallpaper in our bedrooms [which Mrs Thatcher always decorated herself] to church being optional each Sunday.’ Sir Bernard says: ‘Margaret used to say: “I’m not the kind of nurse that says: ‘There, there, I’ll fluff up the pillows.’ I’m the kind who gets [the children] out of bed after the operation because it’s for their own good.” ’ By the time they were sent to boarding school — Mark at eight, Carol at nine — they were so used to their mother being away at work that neither suffered from home sickness. Yet Carol would never forget that when she won a prize on sports day, neither parent was there to see her receive it. As for Mark, he may have been ‘mummy’s boy’, but she was not soft with him. When he wanted to drop out of skiing lessons because he was cold, she refused to allow it. ‘She said he would be perfectly fine and had to suffer,’ recalls a family friend. ‘He didn’t like it.’Sir Bernard has no doubt that while Mrs Thatcher was hardly a conventional parent, ‘she was certainly a caring and loving mother’. And there is no doubt that, as Carol recalled, her mother ‘fell apart . . . completely unable to function’ when Mark went missing for six days in 1982 in the Sahara while driving in the Paris-Dakar rally. Just how far Mrs Thatcher was prepared to take her love for Mark has, for years, been a matter of speculation. From having failed his accountancy exams and struggling to establish himself in business, Mark Thatcher suddenly emerged in the late Eighties as a multi-millionaire. Reports have suggested he was enriched with huge commissions as a silent middle man in arms and construction deals negotiated in the Arab states by his mother. Pulling together: Baroness Thatcher at Sir Denis' funeral in London in 2003, supported by Carol and Mark . Of course, Mrs Thatcher was not complicit in her son’s business arrangements. She implacably denied there had been any impropriety or that her son had grown rich on the back of her efforts for Britain. As Baroness Thatcher reached the final years of her life, she saw divorced Mark happily remarried, while Carol remained single. There was surprise, and some distaste, when Carol’s memoir, published five years ago, discussed her mother’s dementia and revealed she couldn’t remember what she’d had for breakfast that morning. Nor did Sir Mark or Carol spend as much time in their frail and forgetful mother’s company — especially at Christmas — as friends felt they should. Their visits to her Belgravia home were rare. ‘Look, you can’t have everything,’ an elderly Margaret Thatcher said some years ago in a revealing interview with retirement magazine Saga. ‘It has been the greatest privilege being Prime Minister of my country . . . Yes, I wish I saw more of my children. We don’t have Sunday lunch together; we don’t go on holiday skiing any  more. ‘But I can’t regret. And I haven’t lost my children. They have their lives. I took a different life.’","Twins Carol and Mark had a full-time nanny when they were born .

Jane Martin, 51, plundered the bank account of her vulnerable brother Vaughan Martin after their elderly mother died and left him the five figure sum. She moved her brother out of a care home to live with her and her partner Steven Collins so the couple could easily access his money. The pair spent the money on a new BMW Mini Cooper car along with several high performance motorbikes over the course of 15 months. Jailed: Jane Martin, 51, pictured left, and her partner Steve Collins, pictured right, plundered the bank account of her vulnerable brother Vaughan Martin after their elderly mother died and left him more than £60,000 . Their theft was discovered after they . placed Vaughan into respite care so they could go away on holiday and . staff noticed bruises on the 53-year-old’s body. Police were called and an investigation revealed that Collins, also 53, had physically abused Vaughan.

Martin, from Blandford, Dorset, was jailed for three years for theft while Collins was sentenced to four years in prison. Judge Peter Johnson said: 'This was a despicable loss of control. You were living well beyond your means. 'You systematically plundered Vaughan’s bank account to the sum of £62,000 over approximately 15 months.

The couple seized the opportunity to steal £14,000 from her bank account and disguised it as a loan. After she died and the inheritance had gone through, Martin and Collins removed Vaughan Martin from a care home to live in their house. The couple denied charges of theft but were found guilty following a trial. Collins was also convicted of wilful neglect of a vulnerable person, . Lee Christmas, defending Martin, said the pair stole the money following a ‘loss of control out of despair.’ Nicholas Robinson, defending Collins, said: 'The shame of his conduct will be with him until the end of his days.' A Proceeds of Crime Act confiscation hearing will be held at a later date to try and retrieve Vaughan Martin’s money. Afterwards Detective Sergeant Paul Smith, of Dorset police, said: 'The charges follow a very protracted and difficult investigation, due predominately to the fact we could not interview either victim. 'Vaughan was a vulnerable adult, he couldn’t fend for himself.'","Jane Martin, 51, and her partner Steve Collins, 53, removed her brother Vaughan Martin from his care home to live with them in Dorset .

NBC News anchor Brian Williams returns to screens next Tuesday, having been away since undergoing knee replacement surgery on Aug. 6. The network said on Thursday that Willliams will be back to work at 'Nightly News' after Labor Day. NBC has the top-rated evening news program, but ABC's 'World News' with Diane Sawyer has been creeping closer. Lester Holt has been filling in for Williams since his surgery. On the road to recovery: Brian Williams returns the screens next weeks after knee replacement surgery . Williams discussed the knee replacement surgery Thursday in a Nightly News segment about the procedure by Dr. Nancy Snyderman. 'If you don't see me around here for a while, this is the reason why,' he said, describing the 'helmet to the knee' injury he suffered playing high school football. 'I have been in pain for 35 years,' said Williams. 'I have paid a very high price from what's been confirmed to be the single worst New Jersey high school Catholic League football career in history,' he joked. Williams, 54, said he's had three previous surgeries on his right knee but the pain was becoming more of an issue. When it began costing him sleep, Williams said he realized it was time to take care of it. Williams, seen here with his wife Jane, said he had been in pain for 35 years due to his football playing injury . Bone-on-bone: Williams had been in agony for 35 years with his knee, which has lost all its cartilage meaning there was no cushioning between his bones. Surgery replaced it with an artificial joint . 'If this doesn't go perfectly, it can't hurt any more than it does now,' he said. Snyderman said most people who have knee replacement surgery miss between three weeks and three months of work, depending on the physical nature of their jobs. Full recovery takes between six months and a year. Williams joked during an appearance on David Letterman's Late Show last month that 'I want to come back almost a little too early gooned on medication. I think it will be great viewing.' Long considered one of America’s favorite news anchors, Williams' skills as a hip hop MC were revealed by ‘Late Night’ host Jimmy Fallon recently. Back in June, Fallon featured Williams hitting up some 90s West Coast flavor with a mash-up of Warren G’s 'Regulate' and Dr Dre's 'Nuthin but a 'G' Thang', then earlier this month it was time for Brian to get old skool (sic) with a blast of Young MC’s classic 80s cut ‘Bust A Move.’ The hilarious footage was created by splicing together Williams' words from countless news broadcasts to create an almost seamless mash-up of the first and second verses of the 1989 classic all about the age-old story of boys trying to impress the ladies.","NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams returns to screens next week .

A mother-to-be went into labour in her old classroom - and gave birth as her former teacher helped her. Pregnant Leanne Need's waters broke while she was collecting her five-year-old daughter from the primary school she attended as a child. Another mother noticed Leanne struggling to stand and helped carry her inside where staff made a bed from office chairs, blankets and cushions. New mother Leanne Need and her family are reunited with the team at Oldway Primary School who helped her when she went into birth in the school playground . It was only then Leanne realised she was back in her old art classroom and that one of the volunteers lining up to deliver her baby was Jane Smythe - her former teacher. Helped by an off-duty paramedic who just happened to be picking up his own son at the time, Leanne gave birth to a daughter, Callie-Louise, weighing 7lb 11oz. The impromptu reunion happened when Leanne arrived at Oldway Primary School in Paignton, Devon, to pick up the oldest of her three daughters, Lily. Leanne said: 'I was walking through the playground to collect my daughter and I suddenly felt my waters break. Everyone was staring at me and I was so embarrassed. 'That's when the pain hit and all of a sudden it went from zero to ten. 'I spoke to one of the mums who rushed me into the a classroom of the art department. It all happened so quickly. Leanne Need with her partner Andy Jones and their three children Megan, 11 months, Lily, 5, and Callie-Louise at Oldway school where the baby was born along with paramedic Andrew Worden who assisted in the birth . 'The parents who were assisting me had taken my leggings down and then put them back up as they thought we had time, but I knew the baby was going to come any minute. 'I had a bit of a shock when I realised one of my old teachers was in the room but I didn’t have much time to think about anything. 'Within about 15 minutes of my first contraction Callie-Louise was here.' Callie-Louise was delivered by paramedic Andrew Worden and another mum, Sarah Duckett, while Mrs Smythe cordoned off the art classroom to give her privacy. An ambulance was dispatched from nearby Torbay Hospital, where partner Andy Jones, 24, an Asda worker, was expecting to meet Leanne - but the baby was born before medics arrived at the 700-pupil school. Leanne added: 'I had called Andy once I started to have contractions, but the pain got too much and I had to pass him on to someone else who told him to head for Torbay Hospital. Within about 15 minutes of Leanne's first contraction Callie-Louise had arrived . 'In the end the baby was born before the ambulance crew even arrived - all thanks to everyone at the school. 'It’s always been very special to me as it’s where I spent my primary school days and where I’ve always planned for my children to go. 'Now it’s even more special. After I gave birth I told a few of the teachers that I was adamant Callie-Louise was also going to go there - I wouldn’t have it any other way.' Leanne and Callie-Louise are now recovering at home with Andy, Lily and their other daughter of eleven-and-a-half months, Megan. Proud Mrs Smythe gave her former pupil top marks for keeping cool throughout her ordeal and praised fellow parent Mr Worden for stepping in. She had last taught Leanne when she was just a seven-year-old girl. Mrs Smythe said: 'The normal protocol for a medical emergency in school is to call first-aiders to the location as the ambulance is being hailed. 'But this all happened so quickly. Mr Worden was magnificent - calm, reassuring, supportive of Ms Need and all of us. 'He managed a very sudden and unusual situation with utmost professionalism. 'As for Ms Need, with one push and one barely audible whimper, Callie-Louise, was born 15 minutes later at 3:30pm.' Headteacher Pete Maunder added: 'One minute I got a call that Leanne had gone into labour, the next we have a new pupil. 'I have been here for 21 years and thought I had seen everything, but this is definitely a first. We are all really delighted for the family.'","Leanne Need's waters broke while she was collecting her daughter, 5 .

The divorced parents of a 10-year-old boy who went missing in 2010 have appeared on television together for the first time in three years. Dr Phil dedicated the hour-long programme to an interview between Desiree Young and Kaine Horman, whose son Kyron Horman mysteriously vanished from his school. They questioned each other over events which led up to disappearance of the boy, who was seven years old when he failed to arrive at Skyline Elementary School in Portland, Oregon. The boy's mother accused Horman, his father,  of ignoring signs he was unhappy. But Horman said Kyron was struggling to deal with 'split households' Young said: 'I don't blame Kaine for Kyron's disappearance. I want to make that very clear.' But she added: 'Things were happening in the year prior to Kyron going missing. 'It was just ignored. I feel like in that we failed Kyron. We didn't protect him.' Kyron's mother also said she had concerns Horman was 'ignoring signs', referring to the behavior of his wife, Terri Horman, Kyron Horman's stepmother, who took him to school on the day he disappeared. Desiree Young filed a $10 million suit against Terri Horman last year, alleging the stepmother kidnapped Kyron Horman. But the case was dropped, with Young saying it could not move forward without information from the police, who withheld evidence because of the ongoing investigation. Kyron was reported missing in June 2010 after failing to turn up to Skyline Elementary School in Portland, Oregon. Scroll down for video . Interview: Dr Phil dedicated the hour-long programme to a conversation between Kyron's divorced parents Desiree Young and Kaine Norman . Mother: Desiree Young (left) said Kyron's father ignored signs he was unhappy, but did not blame Kaine Horman (right) for their son's disappearance . He was taken to school by his stepmother, Terri Horman, who then stayed with him while he attended a science fair. Terri Horman states she left the school at around 8:45am but Kyron was not present in his first class of the day and was marked down as absent. Three years on, no arrests have been made in the case, despite an exhaustive search by local police and the FBI. During the interview Young also talked about Horman's infidelity while they were married, saying: 'I was seven months pregnant, Kaine was having an affair.' Horman apologised for cheating on her with Terri Horman, who he married around six months after Kyron's disappearance. Allegations: Desiree Young also talked about Horman's infidelity, accusing him of having an affair when they were married and when she was pregnant with Kyron . Kyron's stepmother Terri Horman (left) took him to . Skyline Elementary School on the day he disappeared and is the last . person to have seen him alive . Horman, did not respond to the allegations, focusing on Kyron throughout the conversation. He said the seven-year-old acted out while he switched between Horman's house in Portland and Young's in Medford which is 273 miles away. Young said Terri Horman would call her, asking if she could come and collect Kyron when the boy's father was away on business trips. She recalled one time when she came to pick him up and said 'He was crying. There was something going on. He wanted to live with me. He didn't want to be there.' Horman reacted and said the reason Kyron was upset was because he was just struggling to 'deal with split households' and said he also cried during journeys to Medford. Play: Dr Phil's audience were shown clips of Kyron before he disappeared, including this one of him playing with his mother . Desiree Young filed a $10million lawsuit against Kyron's stepmother Terri Horman, accusing her of kidnap, but she dropped the case in July this year . 'He didn’t want to come see you. I never told you that before.' Both Horman and Young repeated believe that Terri Horman is implicated in Kyron's disappearance. She took him to Skyline School that Friday morning and she is the last known person who saw him. 'I believe she's involved in this. I think she is the one who has all the answers.' A cloud of suspicion has hung over Terri Horman, who is now living with her parents in Roseburg. But she's not been charged and was only named as a prime suspect in a civil law suit filed against her. Young said Terri Horman had put everything in writing, saying she and Kaine Horman had been up arguing until 3 a.m, just hours before Kyron disappeared. Young said Terri Horman wrote that her marriage to Kaine Horman was over and that she planned to return to Roseburg the day the boy vanished. No stone unturned: Authorities have searched more than 28,000 hours for Kyron since his 2010 disappearance. Here, recovery workers take to the water . Volunteers: Desiree Young organised a new search earlier this month and said she had unearthered new evidence . Kaine Horman denied the allegations saying they did not fight at all. Multiple searches have been done but the authorities have never turned up any solid indications of what happened to the boy. Both Young and Horman said they believe he is alive somewhere. 'I will until the day that I die. I still believe that he's going to come through the door.' Horman said he thinks the fact that no clues have turned up only increases the likelihood that Kyron lives. Earlier this month, Young organised a new search in Multnomah County, Oregon, and said that she had unearthed new evidence. She said that the two-day search, which was carried out by 60 volunteers, and 10 search dogs, was successful but she would not be specific about exactly what they found, citing the ongoing criminal investigation. The items were handed over to the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office and officers were examining  whether they hold any significance to the case.

An elderly woman in Alberta, Canada was helpless early this month as mice crawled onto her body and began gnawing at her face. The unnamed resident of St. Therese Villa assisted living in Lethbridge is both physically disabled and suffers from dementia and was unable to stop the mice, which drew blood. Now the woman is on medication to fend off infection and Canada elderly advocates are raising the alarm in order that such a thing never happens again. Appalling: A physically and mentally disabled patient of a Canada elderly care facility was unable to fend off mice that were found gnawing at her face September 1 . The group Friends of Medicare told the Canada Press that the shocking event occurred September 1. 'We found out that last Sunday,' said the group's executive director Sandra Azocar. 'One of the staff of that facility walked into this resident’s room and found mice nibbling on her face.' Azocar told the Edmonton Journal that the facility has a serious mouse problem and also struggles with a bedbug infestation. 'The whole facility has a mice situation. Mice don’t usually come out unless there’s an infestation. They like to hide from humans,' she said. 'This is so unbelievable that this would be happening in Canada’s richest province, that our seniors are having to live under these conditions.' 'Beyond belief': Advocate for elderly care Sandra Azocar called the incident 'beyond reprehensible' and 'utterly appalling' as her group Friends of Medicare spread word of the incident this week . 'There is no excuse for this to be happening in Alberta. Absolutely none.' Azocar said the victim is doing as can be expected. 'She’s doing okay. Emotionally it impacted her and she’s on medication to prevent infection.' The facility sits next to expansive farmland at the edge of town and as harvest season begins, the rodents are displaced from their normal homes in fields by machinery. But in addition to that, Azocar blames insufficient resources. Creepy: The mice even drew blood and a nest of them was found in the woman's closet. 'She¿s doing okay. Emotionally it impacted her and she¿s on medication to prevent infection.' said Azocar . 'How do you do your job when you can’t be everywhere during your shift,' she asked. 'It’s not sufficient. It’s a bigger problem than just the mice. It’s a systemic issue. ' Sheli Murphy, vice-president of rural operations for Covenant Health, which oversees the facility, says the problem is being addressed. 'Now, I do not believe there is a mouse in the building,' she said. 'Any concern when we hear of people that we care for being harmed while they’re in our care is very disturbing. We do need to take those opportunities to investigate and ensure that we can learn from them, regardless of what the incident is.'","The woman is physically disabled and was unable to fend off the September 1 onslaught at her Lethbridge, Alberta nursing facility .

A grieving stepdaughter who asked to see her stepfather's body after he died was stunned when hospital staff then had to admit they didn't know where it was. Billie McLaughlin, 59, had hoped to see her stepfather, . Terry Brady, 74, after he passed away at Inverclyde Royal . Hospital in Greenock, Scotland. A nurse on the ward took her to a bay but then drew back the curtains to reveal an empty bed. The nurse then confessed he didn't where the body was. Shocked: Billie McLaughlin, pictured left with her husband Frank, was stunned when she asked hospital staff to see the body of her deceased stepfather Terry Brady, right, but was then told they didn't know where it was . Mrs McLaughlin said: 'It was disturbing. The nurse led us to his bed on the ward and opened the curtains, but the bed was empty. 'Then he started shouting down the corridor to the other nurses, asking where he'd been moved to. 'As if it wasn't hard enough being told he was dead without that. 'This was a senior nurse and he had no idea where one of his patients was. We found it all completely unprofessional, insensitive and distressing.' She eventually saw the body after other staff members tracked it down to a private room on the same ward. Earlier this month, NHS bosses wrote to Mrs McLaughlin and husband Frank apologising for the blunder claiming it was 'unacceptable' and fell short of their standards. But the fuming family are now set for a face-to-face meeting with hospital chiefs to address a host of other complaints they have about his care during his three-week stay at the Larkfield Unit, based at the NHS's Inverclyde Royal Hospital, in September. Blunder: A spokesperson for NHS Greater Glasgow apologised 'unreservedly' to the family for the error at Inverclyde Royal Hospital in Greenock, Scotland . The couple, from Greenock, allege Mr Brady didn't receive proper medication, was left unwashed and had problems with his feeding tube. 'He was left to die without dignity,' Mr McLaughlin, 60, said. 'I've seen dogs being treated better. 'We went to the hospital every day and were shocked by the number of mistakes being made. 'One day Terry hadn't been given his medication, the next he hadn't been washed. He wore a PEG feeding tube which became dislodged and there were a series of errors in booking him in for surgery to have that resolved. And then to top it all off, we went to see him after he died and the nurses didn't know where he was. 'We put our trust in the Health Service to look after Terry, but it failed him.' Mrs McLaughlin added: 'The NHS doesn't seem to be accepting much responsibility. 'We received a letter responding to the complaint, but there was very little by way of apology - and it was full of mistakes. Anger: Mr and Mrs McLaughlinhave also submitted several other complaints about the treatment Mr Brady received while at the hospital . 'At one point, it refers to my stepdad being reviewed by a doctor on October 9 - but he was dead and buried by then. 'He died on September 9. The fact that they can get details like that wrong just made us even more upset.' Margaret Watt, Chair of Scotland Patients Association, said: 'This is shocking and totally unacceptable. 'We hear so many cases of patients being shifted around hospitals and the staff not having a clue where they are, and it shouldn't be happening - especially with someone who is deceased. 'This must have been very upsetting and stressful for the family. Mistakes like these shouldn't be happening.' A spokesperson for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: 'Our Interim Director of Rehabilitation and Assessment wrote to the family addressing their concerns including the misunderstanding on where their father's body was after he had died.

Popular pontiff: Pope Francis waves to crowds as he arrives to his inauguration Mass in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican . Roman Catholics across the world are going back to church inspired by the charismatic figure of Pope Francis, church authorities say. After years of decline, cathedrals in Britain have seen a 20 per cent rise in congregations since the Argentinian pope was elected as head of the Catholic Church eight months ago. And the 'Pope Francis Effect' is being felt across the world, with new and lapsed Catholics surging back to the confession box 'by the hundreds or thousands', according to the Italian Centre for Studies of New Religions. In Italy half of priests have noted a marked rise in support for the church. The Italian opinion poll Opinioni reported this week that more than four in five Italians have a 'positive' or 'extremely positive' opinion of the Pope. Spain, which had been experiencing a decades-long slump, has also seen attendance figures begin to climb since the pontiff's appointment. Catholic leaders in France, the USA and Latin America have also reported growth in the numbers of churchgoing Catholics. And Latin America - already the biggest single source of Catholic pilgrims to Italy - saw numbers of pilgrims to the centre of the faith rise by 20 per cent from the same period last year. In Argentina there has been a 12 per cent increase in the number who define themselves as Christians since Pope Francis's appointment. The number of Argentinian Catholic pilgrims to Italy has also seen a record increase of 66.5 per cent this year, while the total number of visitors to Rome has increased by 8 per cent overall.

An elk who headbutted a photographer in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park has been euthanized. Video footage of the incredible incident showed photographer James York sitting on the ground by the side of a road. He acted submissively by keeping his head down but the elk became increasingly agitated, knocking of his hat and repeatedly jabbing him around the head and neck with its antlers. It has now emerged that soon after the incident, the elk was put down by Rangers because he 'could not be re-trained to be fearful of humans.' Scroll down for video . Close call: A photographer gets up close and personal with an buck elk in the middle of rutting season . Mr York has said he is 'saddened and speechless' 'I love and respect animals and that’s why I photograph them and don’t hunt them. I am deeply hurt by the loss of such a beautiful creature that in its own way bonded with me. I looked forward to watching him grow to a mature bull as the years passed. I’m truly heartbroken to know he is gone,' he wrote in a statement. At the time of the incident, Mr York managed to remain calm, despite his predicament, and continued to act submissive, perhaps thinking the elk would lose interest and walk away. Incredibly he even managed to take a few cheeky photographs of the animal as it hovered just inches away from his face. The elk continued to stand its ground becoming more and more aggressive. At one point it menacingly begins rubbing its hoof on the ground looking as if it is about to charge. According park spokeswoman Molly Schroer, the elk had been coming back to that area in search of food as a result of previous humans feeding him, and had begun associating humans with food. Stick around: The elk hooks its antlers underneath the photographers shirt as it becomes increasingly aggressive . Park Rangers assured Mr York that he did nothing wrong in the video. The elk had been exhibiting aggressive behavior for a long time, and this was apparently their only course of action. This isn’t something the park resorts to often and, in fact, this elk is the first the park has ever put down. Mr York has said that he can no longer watch the video. 'All the joy is gone.' He says he wished that the photos and video hadn't gone viral and that the elk might still be alive as a result. Aggressive: The photographer holds onto his hat as the elk continues to jab him with its antlers . Head butt: The powerful animal continued to lunge at the photographer, who was at risk of being seriously injured . The video was been posted on YouTube by Vince Camiolo who later emailed the photographer to get his side of the story. At the time Mr York shared his thoughts. 'My first thoughts were 'wow, he's . getting pretty damn close here.' 'But I've been up close before without . incident. I hoped being still and passive would see him pass on. When he . lowered his antlers to me, I wanted to keep my vitals protected and my . head down. I felt that standing up would provoke him more and leave me . more vulnerable to goring.' Submissive: The photographer calmly walks away after the animal refused to back down . Nibble: The Elk tries to eat the photographer's equipment . I think that while protecting myself with my . head down, having my head down was a signal that I was rutting with him. I was concerned at first, but when he started rearing back and lunging . at me later on, I got scared and pi**ed off. 'So I guess at some point if the Ranger hadn't of pulled up, I would have had to disengage the best I could. I've joked with my friends that at least he took me for a buck and not a cow!'","Photographer, James York, repeatedly butted by the animal during rutting season .

CJ's Hot Dogs co-owners Darren Miller and Dean Patterson received a citation on Friday ordering them to remove the nine flags which authorities said violated city of McDonough law. The owners raised the flags for the U.S., the state of Georgia and all branches of the military three months ago.

These are the flags that CJ's Hot Dogs have been ordered to take down . But a code enforcement officer considered the flags to be the same as signs - a violation under city law. The proud Americans believe it is their right to salute the country's service men and women. 'I'm an ex-firefighter for DeKalb county. My partner here [Patterson] is a police officer,' Miller, whose father is a Vietnam veteran, told Fox News. 'There's . just not a lot of places out there honoring our men and women that . serve, whether it's police, fire or military. 'So that's the way we . wanted to decorate our restaurant.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:33 EST, 17 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:24 EST, 17 November 2013 . A political novice who enjoyed the public backing of Phil Robertson from the popular TV show Duck Dynasty was elected to Louisiana's state congress on Saturday night. Vance McAllister, who largely self-funded his campaign, beat establishment candidate Neil Riser, a state senator and Tea Party favorite, in the runoff election for the vacant 5th District seat. Both men are Republicans, but while Riser stuck rigidly to anti-Obama rhetoric, McAllister ran as a more measured pragmatist, who criticized Washington gridlock and hyper-partisanship, particularly over the President’s health care law. Vance McAllister celebrates with his family and supporters after winning the 5th Congressional District election 60 percent to 40 percent on Saturday night . The seat in Louisiana's 5th Congressional District was left open when GOP Rep. Rodney Alexander resigned during the summer to take a cabinet post in GOP Gov. Bobby Jindal's administration. The largely rural district along the Mississippi River delta is dotted with farmland and plagued by poverty. Many GOP races since 2010 have in some form been a Tea Party-vs.-establishment candidate showdown. However, Riser doubled as both the establishment candidate and Tea Party favorite, promoting his experience but also promising strident opposition to President Obama. McAllister, who enjoyed the public support of Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson' left, beat Neil Riser, left, who doubled as both the establishment candidate and Tea Party favorite . McAllister, meanwhile, embraced his outsider status, complete with an endorsement from his close friend Phil Robertson, the patriarch of television's hit series Duck Dynasty. When Robertson endorsed his friend, he admitted that McAllister had ‘the least political experience.’ ‘Plain and simple, this was Riser's election to lose. Riser was the favorite going into the evening. He had the dollars. He had the endorsement of the Republican establishment. He had a strong showing in the primary. Yet, he lost it,’ Joshua Stockley, a political science professor at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, told the Associated Press. An ally of Jindal, Riser had his campaign up and running almost immediately after Alexander announced his resignation in September. The timing prompted cries of favoritism, though Jindal, Alexander and Riser deny any collusion. Riser touted his decades-long experience as a businessman in the funeral industry while arguing his insider experience has led to significant legislative accomplishments such as helping get a state constitutional amendment passed that strengthened gun rights. Vance McAllister, left, said Republicans should show the President more respect and criticized his Tea Party-favored rival Sen. Neil Riser, right, of pandering in an attempt to win votes . ‘I see a very clear distinction in the fact that I've made the votes,’ Riser said. ‘These aren't just talking points for me.’ He was endorsed by the Tea Party of Louisiana and FreedomWorks, a Tea Party-aligned national political action group. Conservative activists said it's McAllister, who's never held public office and noted during the campaign that he'd never even visited Washington, that they worry would be the go-along-to-get-along congressman who isn't conservative enough. McAllister, who spent at least $800,000 of his own money on his campaign, according to the Federal Election Comission, countered eagerly with his newcomer status. ‘I am not part of the establishment; I'm just part of the district,’ he said. Despite that profile, McAllister didn't push the ‘blow the whole place up’ mantra that some GOP primary candidates have offered in similar conservative enclaves around the country. Duck Dynasty: The reality TV series shows the lives of the Robertson family, who became wealthy from their family-operated business, Duck Commander, operated in West Monroe, Louisiana . While he is critical of the . atmosphere in Washington, he doesn't blame it exclusively on Obama. He . also points a finger at House Republicans' 40-plus votes to repeal . Obama's health insurance overhaul. ‘I will vote to repeal it if there's a vote right now today,’ he said in a recent debate. ‘But the truth of the matter is you stand on a platform and pander for votes on something that can't be repealed,’ he told Riser. McAllister says Republicans should show the president respect and that the best course on health care is to work on improving Obama's signature law since he was re-elected and Democrats still control the Senate. Both candidates described themselves as conservatives – opposing abortion, favoring strong gun rights and criticizing Obama's policies generally. Both criticize the levels of federal spending and debt. State Sen. Neil Riser, right, was viewed as favorite to fill the vacant seat since he was an ally of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, seated . ‘I don't think there's a lot of difference in the policy, per se, because we're both true conservatives both fiscally and socially,’ McAllister said. McAllister will take office in time to vote on the next round of budget resolutions in January and, almost certainly, a vote soon after on whether to raise the nation's borrowing limit. Those votes were set up by an October deal to end a partial government shutdown driven by GOP opposition to the health care law. Riser said he opposes efforts to raise the debt ceiling, saying spending should be cut instead. McAllister wasn't so absolute. He conceded he'd be willing to raise the debt ceiling if the increase was coupled with federal spending cuts and a long-term deficit reduction plan. Duck Dynasty is a reality television series which shows the lives of the Robertson family, who became wealthy from their family-operated business, Duck Commander, operated in West Monroe, Louisiana, which makes products for duck hunters, primarily the duck call named Duck Commander. The fourth season premiere on A&E drew 11.8 million viewers earlier this year, making it the most-watched nonfiction cable telecast in history.","Vance McAllister won 60percent of the vote on Saturday night for the vacant 5th District seat .

Dick Cheney's daughter Liz Cheney, who is currently running as a Republican candidate for Senate in Wyoming, reaffirmed her disapproval of gay marriage today despite having a legally-married lesbian sister. In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Chris Wallace asked Cheney if she was flip-flopping on her gay marriage stance. He pointed out that she opposed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage while also supporting the State Department's plan to offer benefits to same-sex employees and their partners. 'It's not, and I stand by both of those positions,' Cheney said. 'I don't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. If people are in a same-sex relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary in your life insurance, there's no reason we shouldn't do that. Not backing down: Liz Cheney reasserted her stance against gay marriage on Sunday despite having a legally-married lesbian sister . 'I also don't support amending the Constitution on this issue. I do believe it's an issue that's got to be left up to the states. I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage,' Cheney added. In September her sister Mary Cheney, who legally married her longtime partner Heather Poe in Washington last year, wrote on Facebook saying her sister's stance on gay marriage was 'dead wrong'. 'For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage. Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families - regardless of how they look or how they are made - all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other.' Liz Cheney responded to that message on Sunday, saying that she too loves her sister but this is an issue 'on which we disagree'. Sisters at war: Wyoming candidate for senate Liz Cheney (left) has announced her staunch opposition to gay marriage despite having a gay married sister, Mary Cheney (right) Dick Cheney, seen here with Liz in 2011, has said he is 'pained' by the on-going gay marriage feud between his daughters . Cheney's strong-stance on the issue of gay marriage may have to do with her fight to win the senate race in ultra-conservative Wyoming. ‘I am not pro-gay marriage,’ Cheney previously said in a statement released by her campaign. Cheney announced her run for senate against incumbent Republican Senator Mike Enzi last month. ‘I believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states,’ the statement continued, ‘and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.’ Push back? Liz Cheney claims her opponent Mike Enzi is conducting a push poll campaign that asks voters 'Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?' Partner: Mary Cheney wed her longtime partner Heather Poe (left) in 2012. They are pictured here at a memorial for victims of the 9/11 attacks . This stance is also a slight departure for the candidate in regards to her high profile family. Since as far back as 2004, Dick Cheney has maintained a pro-gay marriage stance. ‘Lynne and I have a gay daughter, so it’s an issue our family is very familiar with,’ Cheney told an audience that included his daughter while stumping in Iowa in 2004. ‘With the respect to the question of relationships, my general view is freedom means freedom for everyone. People ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to.’","Liz Cheney said today that she 'believes in the traditional definition of marriage'

A sword-wielding maniac who killed the mother of his children in front of them in 2008 and fled to Mexico has finally been arrested. Jesus ‘Chuey’ Canales, who stabbed to death Lucy Preciado, 26, with a sword in front of their three children, was extradited Saturday from Mexico and will finally face charges stemming from the chilling murder. The case received nationwide attention after Mr Canales fled the grisly murder scene. ‘America’s Most Wanted’ even featured him in a 2008 episode. One of the worst murder scenes ever seen: Jesus Canales (left), is the main suspect in the grisly murder of young mother lucy Preciado (right), the brutal killing shocked even veteran police . Detectives tracked the El Savador native from California to New Mexico, Texas, Mexico and his home country, officials said. A tip led authorities to a small town in Jalisco, Mexico. Multiple law enforcement agencies including the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, the U.S. Marshal’s Service and Mexican authorities worked together to track the accused killer down, police said. Mexican officials detained Mr Canales on Thursday before deporting him and handing him over to US Mashals, authorities said. He was then flown Friday to Los Angeles International Airport and handed over to the LASD, which arrested him and tossed him in jail while he awaits arraignment, cops said. Mr Canales will be in court Monday morning to face murder and child endangerment charges, according to police. Life on the lam: Mr Canales was found living in a small town in rural Mexico, authorities also tracked him across New Mexico, Texas and his native El Salvador before bringing him back to Los Angeles . Authorities had been hunting Mr Canales since his cold-blooded murder of Ms Preciado. The woman had become fed up with his marijuana smoking and laziness, according to ‘America’s Most Wanted’ and had decided to leave him. The violent man, then 28, became enraged and impaled her with a sword – turning the apartment he shared with her and their young children into a bloodbath. The dead woman’s terrified nine-year-old daughter Marina called 911 just after the horrific murder happened. ‘Hello, my dad just stabbed my mom,’ the girl told the operator between tears.‘He what?’ the dispatcher asked. ‘He just stabbed my mom,’ she said again while crying. ‘With what?’ Such a tragic death: Ms Preciado's suspected killer may finally be brought to justice, but that won't return a mother lost by her four children . ‘A sword,’ Marina said. Other screaming children can be heard in the background, one of them shouting ‘Daddy!’ The Los Angeles Daily News reported. The carwash attendant fled the scene as the girl tells the operator ‘please, just hurry up. I don’t want my mom to die,’ the Daily News continued. ‘To think about the trauma that was introduced into the children's lives, the tape, as you heard, is just gut-wrenching, and it affects everybody who becomes familiar with the case,’ a police spokesperson told local media shortly after the slaying, according to KABC. Detectives were moved to tears by the dramatic call, a source told the station, adding it was the worst murder scene they had ever seen. Invesitgators worked frantically to track him down, and narrowly missed snagging him in 2008 in New Mexico, according to the Albuquerque Journal. He eluded authorities by only two hours, an official told the paper. Friday’s arrest was the culmination of a five-year manhunt. If convicted, Mr Canales faces up to a life sentence in prison.","Jesus Canales fled the country after killing Lucy Preciado .

Criticised: A senior Tory source said Miss Greening had been slow to grasp the enormity of typhoon . International Development Secretary Justine Greening is under fire within Government for her ‘flat-footed’ response to the Philippines typhoon. A senior Tory source said Miss Greening had been slow to grasp the enormity of typhoon Haiyan and appeared out of touch with the public over a disaster that has touched the hearts of millions in this country. She is said to have compounded the impression by accidentally saying the disaster had taken place in Indonesia during her first big media statement on the subject. The source said Miss Greening had been upbraided by George Osborne during crisis talks on Britain’s response to the disaster last week. The Chancellor is said to have reminded her that her department has enjoyed a controversial 30 per cent increase in its budget and told her to get aid flowing quickly to the disaster zone where thousands perished. ‘There is concern that we’ve appeared so flat-footed,’ the source said. ‘It’s all been so empty and soulless. When she’s talking to the media about our response it sounds like she doesn’t care.’ Treasury sources last night acknowledged that Mr Osborne and Miss Greening had talks on the crisis last week but played down talk of a rift. ‘It didn’t happen like that,’ the source said. A source close to Miss Greening also talked down the row, saying she ‘did not recognise the version of events’. But the claims will fuel public concern that too little of the £10billion aid budget is set aside for emergency relief. Miss . Greening yesterday said the value of official aid to help with the . disaster had now reached £50million. Public donations stand at over . £30million. An aide denied the Department for International Development had been slow off the mark, adding: ‘We are absolutely leading the world in terms of our response.’ On the BBC’s Sunday Politics show, Miss Greening said the  Government had acted as quickly as possible and was now sending warships to help. Miss Greening also said the aid budget should be protected in law, to prevent future governments imposing cuts. When the Coalition was first formed, ministers pledged to enshrine the commitment in law. But the legislation has been put on the back burner because of scepticism about the aid budget among Tory MPs and the public. Miss Greening said: ‘I certainly hope we can find the parliamentary time to [enshrine it in law] but even if we don’t, the key thing is we’ve acted as if that law is already in place.’ Supplies: The Aid Secretary looks at emergency equipment including JCB diggers and Land Rovers on board an RAF C-17 transport plane at Brize Norton in Oxfordshire . However, Miss Greening said some countries, including Pakistan, could lose aid if they failed to collect taxes. Pakistan is now the biggest recipient of British aid cash. Critics complain that the country has one of the lowest tax collection rates in the world – just 0.5 per cent of the population. And some believe the country could afford to fund its own development programmes if the wealthy were persuaded to pay their fair share. Miss Greening said Britain was helping Pakistan to improve its tax take by sending officials from HM Revenue and Customs but indicated that the Government may have to reassess aid budgets for countries that are not doing ‘everything they can’. She said: ‘I think we will need to look at whether we can keep on funding when a country domestically isn’t doing everything it can.’ Warship HMS Daring also arrived in the Philippines yesterday to spearhead the UK’s emergency response to the disaster. The Type 45 destroyer docked at the island of Cebu in readiness to provide humanitarian assistance to the city of Tacloban on nearby Leyte island, one of the worst affected areas. Daring’s Lynx helicopter will today drop shelter kits, food and medical supplies to remote areas that are yet to be reached.","Tory MP said the disaster had taken place in Indonesia in first statement .

There are believed to be around 185,000 Andalusian or Pure Race Spanish horses registered worldwide.

The Christmas turkey will be some 17 per cent more expensive this year as stores attempt to cash in on the festive season. A typical large frozen turkey, enough to feed more than ten people and leave some over for sandwiches, will be around £3 more expensive at £20. However, people buying fresh from a butcher will probably be paying at least £60 – and potentially much more -  for a bird of that size. At the same time other key essentials for the feast, such as potatoes, carrots, peas and, of course, sprouts, are also more expensive. The latest official figures from Smithfield market suggest the price of turkey is up by some eight per cent in the past year. At the same time, the British Turkey Federation claims a smaller increase of six per cent. However, a snapshot survey conducted this weekend found a the price of a large frozen turkey in supermarkets was up by some 17 per cent in a year. Research by The Grocer magazine last year put the price of a frozen turkey weighing 5-6kg at £17, however this year it is around £20, . Tesco is currently charging £20 and Sainsbury’s £22 for a bird weighing 5.3-6.9kg, while Asda is charging £20 for a 5.8kg bird. The other Christmas dinner essential, Brussel sprouts, are up by some 19per cent this year -  a rise from £2.10 a kilo to some £2.50. At the same time a 2.5kg pack of white roasting potatoes is up by some 15per cent to £2. The increases for carrots and peas are smaller. Cashing in: Stores have also upped the prices of brussels sprouts ahead of families doing their Christmas shop . Savings: But shoppers will be able to find cut-price deals on mince pies and satsumas in certain supermarkets . Smoked salmon and stilton are now as much a part of Christmas as the turkey. The survey found that Blue Stilton is up by around 5 per cent to £2.32 for just 100g, while smoked salmon is up by some 28 per cent to £4 for a 100g pack. However, there is some positive news from the survey, which found some significant price reductions this year, particularly on drink. A bottle of Hardys Stamp Shiraz is down from £5.92 to £5; four cans of Stella are down from £4.06 to £3.50, Harveys Bristol Cream from £8.30 to £8 and Baileys from £12.17 to £12. There are also savings on coffee, Satsumas, a tin of Cadbury’s Roses and a pack of mince pies. Paul Kelly, chairman of the British Turkey Federation, said: ‘Massive fluctuations in the price of feed affects the price of a turkey but people will still 'trade up' at Christmas by getting the best they can afford. This year you'll be paying around £53 for a 4kg turkey.’ Iceland claims to offer the cheapest Christmas dinner at a total of £30.50 for a meal for eight. This includes a self-basting Golden Norfolk Turkey, weight - 4.05-5.4kg – at £14. Also on its frozen food menu is a 907g pack of oven ready roast potatoes, and a 900g pack of button sprouts, which come in at £1 each. Its pack of six deep filled mince pies are also £1. Chief executive, Malcolm Walker, said: ‘We’ve worked extra hard this year to be sure that our products offer a better price, or superior quality at a matching price, against what you’ll find at the ‘Big 4’ supermarkets.’","A typical large frozen turkey will be £3 more expensive this year at £20 .

A row has broken out over the £1million will of Labour MP Jimmy Wray, amid claims his disabled youngest son has been left penniless. The Left-wing politician died in May at the age of 78 – but the extent of his wealth has only now been revealed. It has emerged that the three-times married former MP had a villa in France as well as properties in Stirlingshire and Glasgow. Family row: Three-times married Jimmy Wray died in May at the age of 78 . But his family are at war amid claims by his widow that their disabled son, Frankie, 15, was written out of the will in favour of his three grown-up children from his first marriage. Laura Wray, 51, has called in a handwriting expert to challenge the will's authenticity, claiming four signatures on the document may not be her husband's. She also claims that a missing part of the four-page document raises questions about its validity. The couple separated in 2009 but remained friends until his death from bowel cancer. Frankie suffers from Angelman syndrome – the same condition as author Ian Rankin's son, Kit – which means he cannot talk, dress or feed himself He also has difficulty walking and needs 24-hour care. But the will bequeaths Mr Wray's entire estate to his son and daughters from his first  marriage, to Mary Frew:  James, 43, Jacqueline, 49, and  46-year-old Michelle. Glasgow lawyers, Jeffrey Aitken, who represent the Wray estate, have advertised for anyone with an alternative will to contact them. Mrs Wray, an advocate who now owns the marital home –worth an estimate £1million – in Port of Menteith, Stirlingshire, said: 'Jimmy told me he was going to leave money in a trust so that Frankie would want for nothing. 'A couple of days after Jimmy's death I discover he  has been disinherited. I was devastated. It seems inexplicable that Jimmy would do something like this. It doesn't sit with his public persona or the sort of man he was.' She added: 'My concern is for Frankie and not for myself.' Mr Wray's estate is potentially worth £1million if a villa in Cannes, currently on the market at £700,000, is included. At the time of his death, he also owned two flats and a jeweller's shop in Aberfoyle, Stirlingshire, as well as a flat in Muirend, Glasgow. Mr Wray married Laura in 1999 after a bitter divorce from his second wife, Cathy. James Wray jnr said at the weekend that his father's estate was worth closer to £300,00-£400,000. He claimed Mrs Wray had been left the marital home, a house in France and a £1,200-a-month pension. He told a Sunday newspaper: 'I think my dad thought these things were more than sufficient for Frankie.'","Three-times married Jimmy Wray died in May at the age of 78 .

One of Britain’s wealthiest men has pledged to do ‘whatever it takes’ to ensure Nigel Farage’s UK Independence Party triumphs in next year’s elections to the European Parliament. Eurosceptic businessman Paul Sykes, a former Conservative Party backer, is promising to bankroll Ukip’s campaign. His intervention will heighten concerns within the Tory ranks that the seemingly inexorable rise of Ukip could scupper any hopes they have of securing an outright majority in the next general election in 2015. Donation: Wealthy businessman Paul Sykes is promising to donate millions to Ukip . In his last significant foray into the political arena Mr Sykes donated a reported £1.5million to Ukip’s 2004 European election campaign.  The party quadrupled its seats from three to 12. However, Ukip trails behind the other main parties in fundraising and lacks the financial firepower needed to mount a major campaign. In the latest figures released by the Electoral Commission, Ukip received just £113,326 in donations from July to September. The Tories received £3.3million, Labour £3.2million and the Liberal Democrats £800,000. Mr Sykes, who has been estimated to be worth £650million, has given no indication of how much he is prepared to donate this time other than to say he will do ‘whatever it takes’ to ensure it is the largest UK party in the European parliament. ‘I believe we have one last chance to stop the gradual erosion of our national independence. And that chance comes with the European elections,’ he said in a statement. ‘If, as I hope and believe, Ukip score a stunning national victory, then the leaders of the other main parties will have no choice but to abandon their slavish support for the EU.’ Although the European elections are a poor indicator of performance in Westminster elections, there will be concern among Tories that a strong showing by Ukip next year will give them renewed momentum going into the general election. Defected: Mr Sykes joined Nigel Farage's party in the early 00s over his hardline views on Europe . While few expect them to take any . seats at Westminster, many Tories fear that they will draw enough votes . to deny the Conservatives any chance of an overall majority. If Tory voters in some areas to Ukip it could make it easier for Labour and the Lib Dems to win crunch seats. Mr . Sykes was a backer of the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher in the . 1980s but broke with the party in 1991 over John Major’s stance on the . Maastricht Treaty. In 2000 he briefly returned to the Tory fold under William Hague only to be expelled the following year over his hardline views on Europe. He said that he hoped success for Ukip in next year’s election would compel the other parties to accede to calls for an early referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU. Tory support in the North has dropped further and the party is set to fare as badly there as in Scotland, a poll reveals. Its support in the region has dropped from 31 per cent to 29 per cent, with Labour strengthening to 35 per cent. The ICM Wisdom Index asks voters to predict how well a party will do, rather than asking how they will vote.","Paul Sykes, a former Tory Party backer, has promised millions of pounds to Ukip to ensure their success in the European Parliamentary elections .

Paying the jobless over-generous benefits does not make them happy, a new Europe-wide study reveals. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh also insisted that extra welfare does not make the unemployed lazy and less likely to look for work. Instead motivation levels of those without a job are more likely to be affected by the way society views them. Employment levels across Europe vary widely, in part as countries struggle with the impact of the eurozone crisis . Researchers at the University of Edinburgh compared how unemployment affected people's life satisfaction in all European Union countries and Norway, and found there was no over-riding trend. The well-being of jobless people is not affected by the level of benefit they receive, they found. Dr Jan Eichhorn, of the University of Edinburgh's School of Social and Political Science, said: ‘Those who claim that greater unemployment benefits lead to less motivation for people to seek employment should think again - for most people, it is not the degree of state provisions that determines how they personally feel about the experience of being unemployed. ‘Unemployment does not just result in a loss of income but also a change in social position - that is perceived differently in different societies.’ Rates of unemployment vary across Europe, with many countries still struggling under the impacts of the Eurozone crisis. In the UK, the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.6 per cent, closer to the 7 per cent target set by the Bank of England before interest rates could rise. But in Spain and Greece it remains at more than a quarter, and is around 17 per cent in Cyprus and Croatia. Dr Jan Eichhorn . The study used data from Eurostat and the European Values Study to examine how the jobless in different countries are motivated to find work. It found that some of the countries with the most generous benefits have the greatest loss in life satisfaction for their unemployed, and vice versa. For example, Luxembourg and Finland are in the top 25 per cent for unemployment benefits expenditure yet have high levels of dissatisfaction in people without jobs. The reverse is true for Romania and Poland, which are in the bottom 25 per cent for benefit provision while their unemployed are among the least affected. The UK is ranked in the mid 50 per cent . for the level of benefits provided to the country's unemployed and is . ranked as 18th for the extent of loss in life-satisfaction of the . jobless. Jobseeker: Being made more in benefits does not make someone less likely to find work, the study found (file picture) It was concluded that cultural and demographic factors have a greater impact on the lives of jobless people, such as having no job in a country that has a proportionally older population and fewer people at working age. Other factors highlighted by the report as having a negative impact on personal well-being were high inflation levels and income inequality. The country with the highest level of dis-satisfied unemployed people was Germany, with a rate that was 50 per cent higher than second-placed Hungary. At the bottom of the table was Romania, which is also in the bottom 25 per cent for benefit provision, while Spain is in the top 25 per cent for benefits expenditure yet unemployed citizens remain relatively unaffected, with the country sitting above Romania in 27th position.","Countries with most generous benefits have the greatest loss in life satisfaction for jobless, Europe-wide study suggets .

Thousands of Roma could claim compensation after a list made by police in Sweden was deemed to have breached their human rights. Skane County police said they compiled the list of 4,700 names because it 'helped them tackle crime'. However a commission has ruled that the list was prejudicial as it lead to Roma being watched who hadn't done anything wrong. Thousands of Roma could claim compensation after a ruling that a list of names kept by Swedish police breached their human rights (file picture) The list, which the commission said was the result of several years work, contained the names of 200 dead people, alongside children's names and those of distant relations of Roma living in Sweden. Skane police could now be in for a bill of hundreds of thousands of pounds following the decision by the Commission on Security and Integrity Protection as every one of the 4,500 living people named are entitled to compensation. Skane County police has claimed the list was assembled to 'fight a criminal network rather than to keep tabs on people of a specific ethnicity.' However the ruling found that there was 'no clear reason' for the list, adding: 'An undefined purpose gives no framework to the personal data, which in practice undermines the protection of individuals' integrity.' Sweden's national police commissioner Bengt Svenson said: 'I hope and pray to god that this is the only registry of this kind. It's upsetting. This is completely unacceptable and I cannot understand the purpose of it.' The list, which included the names of 200 dead people and children, was deemed unlawful because it had 'no clear purpose' despite officers claiming the used it to fight crime (file picture) The news comes just a week after European human rights campaigners warned that media coverage of missing girls discovered with Roma families risked perpetuating 'age old myths' about the travelling people. The case of Maria, a blonde girl found living with Roma in Greece, stunned the nation after she was found to belong to a Bulgarian family leading to allegations of kidnap. Nils Muiznieks, the Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, said: 'Most news reports, not only in Europe but all over the world, have insisted on the ethnicity of the families from which the children have been taken, thus propagating age-old myths portraying Roma as child-abductors.' Meanwhile Britain is preparing to open its doors to thousands of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants from 2014 as part of EU free-movement agreements. While Roma make up only a small percentage of the population of Romania, some have expressed fears that a disproportionately high number will come because a large number of them live in poverty. Just last week David Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary, warned that his constituency of Sheffield could face race riots if the migrants arrive in large numbers. He called on Roma people to 'change their culture' and send their children to school to assuage 'understandable tensions' in the area.","List of 4,700 names was compiled by Skane County police .

One witness, a man who declined to be named, said: 'I came past and saw people panicking around the side of the lorry. 'He was trapped under the wheels at the back of the truck, people were screaming, there was nothing that they could do. 'The lorry looks like it was turning left and he just went straight under. 'The paramedics came but he was crushed under the wheels, there wasn't much they could do.' What was left of his twisted road bike could be seen caught under the driver's cab. Police officers remove the bike, which was been twisted in the accident . A police tent next to the lorry involved in the incident.

'I came out after a client told me what happened and just saw him lying there while the paramedics tried to help him. 'He was just having a normal Monday and then his life ended, I'm so upset.' Cyclist Tristan Gunnery cycles through the junction every day. Speaking at the scene he said: 'The thing is I've been knocked off a few times but if I see a bus or truck I stay clear. 'The thing is if you're cycling you need to be defensive. The lights are quick there so people rush. 'It lets three or four cars through there so people try and get through quickly. 'But some cyclists take risks, I've learned my lesson.

Candle-lit: Cyclists showed their support for the victims of London's dangerous road network . Last week the Mayor of London was accused of shirking his responsibility and insensitivity after saying cyclists should 'think of the laws of the road' after a spate of deaths involving cyclists in the capital. Speaking just hours after the fifth cyclist died as a result of a crash on London's roads in just nine days, Boris Johnson appeared to blame cyclists, saying their 'hasty, rash decisions' were 'endangering' their lives.

A £45million transformation of the 116-year-old Tate Britain gallery has been unveiled today. Architects have worked on the oldest part of the Grade-II listed building, reopening the main entrance and installing a breathtaking giant spiral staircase at its heart. It was built on the site of a Victorian prison in central London, used to hold criminals before they were shipped to Australia. Magical: The gallery's circular balcony, which surrounds the stunning centre of the building, has been closed since the 1920s but has been opened today . Magnificent: A new staircase has been installed at the heart of Tate Britain, which has gone through a £45million revamp . Other changes include a re-hanging of the . collection displays and the restoration of a mural, which was damaged . in a devastating 1928 flood. Parts of the building have been closed for almost two years while work was completed. Most of the funding, 95 per cent, came from private philanthropy while the remaining five per cent was from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Tate Britain, designed by architect Sidney RJ Smith, opened its doors in 1897 after industrialist Henry Tate offered his collection of British art to the nation. Cleaned up: Workers clear the steps at Tate Britain as its redesign was unveiled today, 116 years after it was first built on the site of Millbank Prison . Splendour: A new window by artist Richard Wright has been installed in the entrance to Tate Britain as part of the expensive two year project . Breathtaking: Architects Peter St John and Adam Caruso have revitalised The Tate's entrance, cafe and gallery spaces, which has not really been touched for a century . Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota called the unveiling, before it is opened to the public on Tuesday, 'a very exciting day'. First known as the National Gallery of British Art, Tate Britain, on the bank of the Thames, first opened in 1897. Sir Henry Tate, the man who built his wealth on sugar and bought the patent for sugar cubes, donated cash and art for it. It was built on the site of Millbank Prison, which was most famous for holding prisoners before they were shipped to Australia. It houses a priceless collection, including a huge number of works by J. M. W. Turner, William Hogarth, Thomas Gainsborough and John Constable, including his famous Flatford Mill painting, above. Modern artists like David Hockney and Francis Bacon are also among the famous artwoks on display. He added: 'Between 1960 and 1990, people felt apologetic about this building. They felt the need to lower the heights of ceilings and introduce false walls. Since 1990 we have been steadily opening up the galleries. 'What you see today is essentially the realisation that the building itself can be used in many different ways and artists can respond to it in a way that would have been unforeseen 30 or 40 years ago.' He said that the belief, held recently, that a gallery had to look like a white cube to show off work properly 'had changed for the better'. 'In the 1960s, artists, architects and museum curators felt that they needed to create what they regarded as neutral spaces.... We've gone back to museums in a way that they're designed to be seen,' he said. Tate Britain director Penelope Curtis said that the building had 'regained its logic and symmetry' thanks to the refurbishment, which was 'essentially on time and on budget'. She said that the history of the site, from 'swamp, to penitentiary to art gallery', was now at the heart of the building. She added that they had 'rediscovered the beautiful original features of parts of the building' and that Sidney Smith was 'a better architect than many people recognised'. Architects Adam Caruso and Peter St John said that today's generation was less interested in dismantling the old, adding that despite the British construction industry having a chequered reputation, they were 'extremely proud' of the quality of the work.","Tate Britain revamp has been two years in the making and is unveiled today .

A vintage vinyl shop boss is suing his former girlfriend for allegedly not giving back his record collection when they split up. David Carbines, 32, claims 43-year-old Cora Spaans, failed to return his records including rare Beatles and Elvis LPs after they broke up in 2012. As well as being a couple, Mr Carbines and artist Miss Spaans, ran an art and rare record shop called Abstracks, in Worthing, Sussex, before the split. Bad break-up: David Carbines (left) took ex-girlfriend Cora Spaans (right) to court accusing her of not giving back his record collection when they split . As part of a messy break-up, Miss Spaans last year made a legally-binding promise at Worthing County Court not to damage or dispose of any of his things left behind in the flat they once shared. But Mr Carbines claims that despite attempts by his mother and himself to collect the valuable record collection, some 7,000 are still missing. Among the vinyl lovingly gathered over 18 years and which he says are worth £17,500, are a valuable early pressing of The Beatles’ White Album and a copy of Elvis Presley’s eponymous debut LP, he says. In March, the music graduate tried to have Miss Spaans jailed for allegedly breaking her promise - but a Worthing County Court judge believed her when she said she had no more of his property. As well as being a couple, Mr Carbines and artist Miss Spaans ran an art and rare record shop, called Abstracks, in Worthing, before the split . Mr Carbines, whose record collection still numbers 6,000, took his case to the Court of Appeal, where he said what he really now wanted was his records back, or cash to compensate him for losing them. He told Mr Justice Coleridge that he knew exactly which of his records were missing because he bought them himself. Record shop boss David Carbines outside court where he accused his ex of keeping vinyl from his record collection . Although some were bought new for a few pounds others like The Beatles and Elvis records are much more valuable. They had been stored at the couple’s flat but were not among those collected from there by his mum or from a garage by himself, he told the court. He produced for the judge a 70-page document, not seen by the county court judge in March, listing every one of the records he says is missing. Included in it are the entire back catalogues of the Spice Girls, Girls Aloud and Five. Some are also signed by the artists. Holding out some hope for Mr Carbines, Mr Justice Coleridge said his case was not one for an appeal, but that his fresh evidence could justify a new case going to the county court. 'Mr Carbines is a serious collector of records and his whole collection he has itemised, from A-Z, in a lengthy schedule which runs to 70 pages,' said the judge. 'It is a most impressive document and he says that, because he bought every one himself, he has been able to complete that from his own memory. 'Not only is he seeking the return of the items, but he is seeking instead, where appropriate, compensation in lieu of the return of the items. 'I am satisfied, having seen the list, that there may be further evidence which, had the judge had it on March 5, could have made a distinct difference to the result.' David Carbines ran record shop Abstracks (pictured) with Cora Spaans before they broke up . Mr Carbines, a songwriter, also says a hard drive containing his self-penned songs and the service history of his 1986 Ford Capri are missing. Abstracks opened up in August 2011, but was closed by the following September by which time his relationship with Miss Spaans had ended. She vehemently denies having any of Mr Carbine’s property and was not present or represented at the Appeal Court hearing.

A midwife used a plastic spoon to induce a pregnant woman to go into labour, despite there being no complications with the labour, a misconduct hearing was told today. Patience Adams allegedly decided to use the plastic cutlery to speed up the birth minutes after a colleague prevented her using a needle, it was said. The Nursing and Midwifery Council heard, that Adams also failed to get the patient’s consent for the unorthodox procedure at King’s College Hospital NHS Trust. A midwife used a plastic spoon to induce a pregnant woman to go into labour, despite there being no complications with the labour, a Nursing and Midwifery Council misconduct hearing was told today . Charlotte Eadie, for the NMC, said the woman, known only as patient A, was a Madarin speaker with little English. 'In an interview meeting she (Adams) said she had no difficulty communicating with patient A and that her husband was translating’ ‘At times she had to use sign language.’ The panel heard that Adams tried to induce labour at around 12.30am on 8 May 2011. ‘An artificial rupture of membranes was carried out, this was despite the fact that labour was normal and there was no concerns regarding the welfare of the child,’ said Miss Eadie. There is no record in the medical notes to show why Adams chose to begin this procedure, the panel heard. Miss Eadie said that Alison Taylor, a midwife who was also present at some stages throughout the labour, was ‘concerned’. Adams allegedly asked Miss Taylor to fetch a green needle, which would never be used for this procedure, and Adams then unsheathed it, it was said. She then began to start an internal procedure. Miss Taylor asked Adams why she was not using her fingers for the procedure and that she offered to fetch another midwife. ‘The registrant resheathed the needle and handed it back to Miss Taylor who then disposed of it,’ said Miss Eadie. The council heard, that Adams also failed to get the patient's consent for the unorthodox procedure at King's College Hospital NHS Trust . ‘Miss Taylor was then called away, and around ten to 15 minutes later observed the registrant coming out of the kitchen with a plastic spoon.’ Miss Eadie told the panel that the spoon ‘presented a risk of infection for using a non sterile object and a risk to the child due to the sharp end.’ Adams, who is present and represented at the hearing in central London, faces a string of allegations relating to the incident on 8 May 2011 while she was employed by Kings College Hospital NHS Trust. She admits that she did not offer the patient access to a translator and that she used a plastic spoon to perform the artificial rupture of membranes. She also admits an allegation that she did not record foetal observations, including the heart rate and summary of care and that she carried out two internal examinations without medical reason for doing so. But Adams denies attempting to use a needle to perform the artificial rupture of membranes and that she performed the procedure without discussing it with the patient or obtaining her consent. If she is found guilty of misconduct, she could face being struck off the register.

Scientists are spending £500,000 of taxpayer’s money to see whether children’s opinions on war and the armed forces are affected by playing with dolls wearing military clothing. Researchers from the Universities of Portsmouth, Exeter, and Royal Holloway University of London will spend three years looking in to whether dolls like Action Man help children understand the military. They also aim to determine how action figures shape young people's views on conflict and the armed forces. Warfare: Scientists are spending almost £500,000 on a study to see whether children's views on conflict are affected by dolls - such as these Her Majesty's Armed Forces dolls - in military clothing . The study will focus on top-selling Her Majesty’s Armed Forces (HMAF) dolls - licensed by the Ministry of Defence. HMAF dolls are based on current British armed forces and come with an assault rifle, radio, flak jacket, body armour, helmet and goggles. The £492,508 project is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. Researchers are expected to report their findings in 2016, shortly after the withdrawal of British troops from Afghanistan. Research: Scientists will use a variety of dolls, such as these Action Men, to gauge how they shape young people's perception of the military . Research collaborator Professor Klaus . Dodds said: 'We are not examining whether war toys are good or bad, or . the psychology of such play. Findings: The results of the study - which will use dolls like GI Joe, pictured - will be published in 2016 . 'We will be examining how such toys . help shape British attitudes to our armed forces and what ideas children . are incorporating from outside sources, such as television news . footage. 'The war on terror . is being played out everywhere and since 9/11, our security and . surveillance has come under intense examination. 'Understanding war, conflict and security in modern life is an urgent task for social scientists.' The current best-seller in the doll range is a ten-inch high infantry soldier in desert combats - an image that is often seen on television news about Afghanistan. Principal investigator Dr Tara Woodyer added: 'Play has frequently been overlooked as irrelevant to how people come to understand the world. 'Yet it is precisely this apparent banality, the taken for granted nature of play, that allows its role to go unchallenged. 'Toys, and how children play with them, are not just a response to the world, they help shape our culture. 'The role of action figure dolls has been unduly neglected, especially given the enormous academic attention focused on their female equivalent, Barbie.' The action figure toy arrived in the UK as a repackaged American GI Joe toy in 1966 and was then re-branded as Action Man, which ceased to be made in 2006.","Researchers from Universities of Portsmouth, Exeter, and Royal Holloway University of London taking part in the £492,508 project .

At the age of just 16, Victoria Rathmill has become the world’s youngest stem cell donor. The British schoolgirl was spurred on to donate her cells after a family friend was tragically diagnosed with leukaemia earlier this year. Without her parents knowledge the A-level pupil signed up to the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register in February when she was just 16. In just a few months she was . identified as a perfect match to a patient suffering from blood cancer . and made a donation at a London Clinic last month. This . selfless act made the teenager from Macclesfield, Cheshire, the . youngest ever person in the world to provide stem cells to a . non-relative. Miss . Rathmill, who is now 17 said: ‘At first I was like: ""I’ll join when I’m . 18, I’m not going to make any difference"", but then a friend of our . family got ill and so I felt the need to join up.’ The All Hallows Catholic College student confessed that she did not tell her surprised parents about her plan to donate. She . said: ‘It was only a couple of weeks after I signed up that I told my . mum. Anthony Nolan sent the spit kit out to me and she asked me what it . was. ‘Though she was taken aback a bit at first, she thought it was a nice thing to do, especially given our friend’s experience.’ After registering with the charitable organisation the youngster received a phone call in October- just six months later- telling her that she had been matched to a patient. ‘After I signed up I just stopped thinking about it really. You just don’t expect to get the phone call within six months of registering,’ she said. She added: ‘It’s quite shocking to think I’m the youngest-ever - you’re never the first to do anything nowadays, it’s all been done already.’ Miss Rathmill revealed that she would happily donate again describing the process as being similar to giving blood. She said: ‘It’s just like giving blood really. I would do it again because it’s not that difficult. It’s just a couple of days out of your life to save somebody else’s - and I got a free trip to London.’ The teenager’s proud mother Paula described her daughter as being a headstrong and determined individual. Selfless: Without her parents knowledge the A-level pupil signed up to the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register in February when she was just 16 . She said: ‘It never really occurred to me to try and stop her from helping another person in their hour of need. It makes me very proud. ‘Yet even though she’s strong, what she’s doing takes courage and she’s still only 17. I didn’t want her to feel bad if it doesn’t work out for the patient, which it might not. ‘But she’s level-headed and after having gone through the donation process, she knows she couldn’t have done anymore.’ Mrs Rathmill has now urged other parents to encourage their children to donate their cells. She added: ‘To others who go through this I would say look it up, get involved and then encourage your child as much as you can. ‘I personally feel you have to trust your children to make the right decisions. ‘While it’s up to each family to decide for themselves, the question I asked myself was ‘what if Victoria was ill and a 17-year-old donor could help save her life?’ If the boot was on the other foot, I know what I would want.’ The charity’s bone marrow register is just one of two in the world that accept under-18 donors. Anthony Nolan chief executive Henny Braund said the teenagers’ donation was ‘genuinely impressive.’ He added: ‘It shows both what a special young woman she is, and how teenagers can be sufficiently mature, caring and engaged with the world around them to help save an unwell stranger.’","Victoria Rathmill signed a bone marrow register when she was just 16 .

Police in North Carolina have released more information on the shocking case - including how the smell of the feces-covered house would 'take your breath away' - as neighbors come forward describing how the boy would beg them for food and, at one point, was 'purple with cold' and 'looked pitiful'. Steve Mills lives on land adjacent to that of the victims foster parents, Dorian Harper, an emergency room nurse, and Wanda Larson, a social worker, who have been charged with intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment and animal cruelty. The couple have been jailed and, at a brief court appearance Monday, their bond was set at $500,000 each. The pair also have four adopted children aged from eight to 14. Shocking conditions: Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Lee Harper were arrested Friday after a sheriff's deputy found the shivering 11-year-old boy . All five have been placed in care . outside Union County because Larson is a child protective services . supervisor for that county's Department of Social Services. She has recieved extra charges of willful failure to discharge her duty. Neighbor . Mr Mills said in late July or early August a boy came running to his . home 'crying and panicking and said ''Mister, can I have something to . eat?''.' As Mr Mills' wife went to fix a sandwich, the other boys arrived. 'They told me he was the newest one (and) said they were going to take him back,' Mr Mills told Charlotte Observer. This boy 'was real small'. Union County sheriff's office says it appears the 11-year-old boy found handcuffed to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck was routinely handcuffed in the home by his foster parents. Wanda Sue Larson (pictured) and Dorian Lee Harper were arrested and charged Friday after a happened to stumble across the boy . 'He looked the smallest one out of the bunch. ... We just assumed he was kind of scared, (being in a) new house, new area, new siblings,' said Mr Mills. Joyce Bigham, who lives across the street, told ABC News the five children 'dress like orphans' and that the 11-year-old boy 'looked pitiful'. Another neighbor, who asked not to be named, said a boy appeared on her porch in May 2012 'purple with cold, with no coat, saying he was hungry'. 'When asked, he said he had no mother or father and didn’t know where he lived,' she said. The woman brought him inside and fed him a sandwich. 'It didn’t take him 10 seconds to eat it,' she said. He told her he was 10-years-old and that he had slept in her barn, behind her house, the night before. When she told him she would take him home, she said, he answered: 'No. I want to stay here.' Her daughter called 911 and a sheriff’s deputy came out, spoke with the boy, made a phone call, then told him she’d take him home. 'He didn’t refuse. He just went with her.' The neighbor said the deputy let her know she had returned him to his foster parents and said the man insisted the boy hadn’t been missing more than 30 minutes. The neighbor believes it was the Harper-Larson home. 'I know that’s where she took him (although) you can’t see the house from the road.' Dorian Lee Harper was arrested Friday after a foster child was found cuffed by the ankle to his front porch in Monroe, N.C., with a dead chicken hanging from around his neck. Larson and Harper are charged with numerous offenses . Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said said the condition of the house was 'terrible'. 'It was filthy, feces on the floor, holes in the wall,'  he said. 'The bathroom, you could see from outside of the hall into the bathroom. Sink was trashed. No running water. The smell took your breath away.' All the children appeared to be suffering from malnutrition and Cathey said that the first thing law enforcement did for them was buy them pizza. Authorities stumbled across the horrific situation after a deputy, who was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to the porch. Dead: This lifeless chicken was found around the neck of a foster child who was handcuffed to the porch of his in Union County, N.C., on Friday. His foster parents have been arrested and charged with multiple offenses . He approached the house and was confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for Harper's identification and an explanation as to why the child was handcuffed to the porch. According to WBTV, one of the children opened the front door, releasing several large dogs who attacked the deputy. By the time he had the dogs under control, Harper had removed the child from the porch and left the dead chicken on a barrel in front of the house. Other officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal investigation was opened. The children were removed from the home and are in the care of protective services outside of Union County. 'It's just shocking,' Captain Ronnie Whitaker said on Saturday. 'It's just disturbing that anyone would treat a child in such a manner.' Squalor: Authorities have described the Union City house as 'terrible', covered in feces, urine and garbage, and something 'you wouldn't want to walk through, much less live in' Disturbing: The child services worker lives at this property with four adopted children and one foster child . Both Larson and Harper were charged with intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment, and cruelty to animals due to the condition of some of their pets. It is unclear what prompted the use of the dead chicken and handcuffs on the boy. Whitaker said he could not disclose details from police interviews conducted as part of the investigation. Larson and Harper remained jailed on Saturday. They each face charges of intentional child abuse that inflicted serious injury, false imprisonment and cruelty to animals, with the latter allegation based on the condition of some of the family pets, the sheriff's office said. Larson also is charged with willful failure to discharge her duty as a public official and both are due in court on Monday.","Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Lee Harper have been charged with multiple counts of intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment and animal cruelty .

Over 50 people have been sickened - with one child and adult airlifted to hospital in a critical condition - following a carbon monoxide leak inside a remote Utah elementary school on Monday morning. The San Juan County Sheriff’s Office said the incident was reported around 9.30 a.m. local time at the Montezuma Creek Elementary School, prompting an evacuation, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. About 300 children are believed to attend the school. Staff called the Sheriff's office reporting that students and staff were dizzy and sick. San Juan School District Superintendent Douglas Wright said the leak occurred as people arrived at the school and before the day’s classes started. The exhaust of a faulty water heater system is suspected to have caused the leak, according to Clayton Holt, the business administrator for the San Juan School District. A carbon monoxide leak Monday at Montezuma Creek Elementary in southeastern Utah elementary sickened over 50 people, with more than half that number hospital and two considered critical. County Emergency Services Director Rick Bailey said paramedics were rushed to the school from Bluff, Monticello and Blanding, along with three Navajo National ambulances and police officers from several jurisdictions. 'A total of 30 students and adults were triaged at the scene,' Bailey said. 'Two patients, including one student and one [female] adult were transported via medical helicopter to area hospitals.' He said 23 other students and adults went to local hospitals by ground transport. The remained of the students were transferred to White Horse High School. Holt said that as of early afternoon, doctors at Blue Mountain Hospital in Blanding, and at other area medical facilities, reported that all their patients were in good condition. He said he understood the one adult female and one child airlifted from the school to more distant medical facilities remained in 'serious shape,' but he had no further information. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless and tasteless gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to humans and animals when encountered in higher concentrations, however it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities.In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable, short lived, having a role in the formation of ground-level ozone. A major industrial source of CO is producer gas, which is used to create heat and fuel equipment like ovens. The school remained closed for the day as authorities further investigated the leak. The school is on the Navajo Reservation about 15 miles west of the Colorado border. Shawna Hamm, who lives in Aneth, a town about 8 miles southeast of Montezuma Creek, said she saw a helicopter fly past her house, as well as two Navajo Nation police officers with lights and sirens. Earlier, she had received a text message from her sister-in-law, a cook at the elementary school, saying that there had been a gas leak and she was feeling dizzy. Hamm’s nephew, a student at the school, also complained of dizziness. While other children were being air- lifted to the hospital, her nephew’s father picked him up and brought him home, where he seemed to be doing fine, Hamm said. She said her sister-in-law, who is about three months pregnant, got a ride to a hospital in Blanding to get checked out. Montezuma Creek is located about 10 miles east of Bluff.","Staff at Montezuma Creek Elementary School, in southeastern Utah, reported students and staff being dizzy and sick about 9.30am Monday .

The 50th anniversary episode of the famous sci-fi series will be aired this Saturday - and whereas most birthdays are marked with a card, this one has been immortalised by the covers of Radio Times. The Radio Times introduced the first ever episode on the week of Saturday 23 November and the next week it got its first cover on the magazine. William Hartnell was the first Time Lord, and was followed by Patrick Troughton in the Doctor's footsteps . Jon Pertwee was the third Doctor in the seventies, while Tom Baker took up the reins and made the part his own with his eccentric speech and costumes - and a tendency for long scarfs and jelly babies . Peter Davison took on the role in the eighties, while Sylvester McCoy made the Doctor a much more darker and more manipulative character . Five decades and 50 appearances later they have decided to celebrate Doctor Who's 50th anniversary with 12 different covers, featuring 12 incarnations of the Time Lord. However, whereas viewers across the country will welcome the new episode, some older members of the audience will remember that technically the show isn't 50, owing to the period when it was dropped from our screens. Doctor Who boss Steven Moffat has criticised BBC bosses for axing the sci-fi show in the 1980s. Michael Grade, then BBC1 controller, made the decision to 'rest' the series because it had become 'ghastly' and 'pathetic'. Paul McGann appeared in the sci-fi television film in 1966, while Colin Baker played both the Doctor and Commander Maxil . John Hurt starred as an unknown incarnation of the Doctor, while Christopher Eccleston played the Doctor in 2005 - and was the first actor to take the role despite being born after the series was created . David Tennant fulfilled his childhood dream by playing the Time Lord, while Matt Smith is the youngest person to play the Doctor . Executive producer Moffat told the Radio . Times: 'What can one say about 50 years of Doctor Who? Well, first of . all, one can be pedantic. 'Doctor Who hasn't been on for 50 . years - owing to the outright stupidity and unforgivable blindness of . the BBC (sorry guys, it needs to be said), there was a 16-year gap.' He added: 'That gap is important though. It confers something very special on this most special of all shows, immortality. 'Doctor Who...is the show that comes back. Axe it at your peril. Someone like me is going to call you a fool.' Lord Grade previously defended his decision to drop the show. The Time Lords (from left) William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann, Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant and Matt Smith . 'My . argument with the producer was that the same audience watching Doctor . Who was watching Star Wars and ET. The show was ghastly. It was . pathetic. 'It just got more . and more violent; they resorted to the most horrific hangings. It was . just horrible to watch. It lost its way, ' he said. He . wrote in Steve Berry's book Behind The Sofa: Celebrity Memories of . Doctor Who: 'Now the production values are high, the scripts are witty, . it's full of invention. 'And . digital effects today enable you to do so much more. The only . connection it has with its previous life is the title and the premise, . but it's light years ahead.' BBC director-general Tony Hall told the magazine that 'it was the BBC who reinvented' the show 'with some the best acting and writing on television anywhere in the world.' Sophie, Countess of Wessex meets past and present Doctor Who actors (form left to right) Matt Smith, Tom Baker, Peter Davison and John Hurt during a reception to mark the 50th anniversary of the hit TV series at Buckingham Palace . Meanwhile, former Doctor Who star Tennant said that returning to the programme for the one-off appearance in The Day Of The Doctor felt like waking up out of a dream. 'The first day I arrived, the costume's hanging there like it used to every day. It feels like 'where have I been? Have I just woken out of a dream?'', he said. John Hurt, who has a starring role in the 50th anniversary episode, said that he was not a fan of the original series. 'I don't think I saw the first episode and I think it escaped me for quite a long time. It was a kiddies' programme, or it was assumed to be. It was known basically for the fact that all the scenery used to fall over,' he said. Today the Daleks invaded Buckingham Palace as stars of Doctor Who past and present attended a reception to mark the 50th anniversary of the show. Four Time Lords in total - Matt Smith, Tom Baker, Peter Davison and John Hurt - were in attendance at the event hosted by the Countess of Wessex, who herself has been fan of the show since she was a child. Props from the show, including two versions of the Tardis, a pair of Daleks and K-9 the robot dog, were set up in the Palace’s Bow Room.","The Radio Times introduced the first ever episode of the sci-fi series .

Not impressed: Veteran critic Barry Norman wonders what Martians would think after a night on the sofa . He has cast his critical eye over numerous Hollywood turkeys during his distinguished career as a film reviewer. But none, it would appear, come close to Barry Norman’s dismal verdict on today’s TV adverts. The 80-year-old veteran critic has launched a wide-ranging attack on the ‘worrisome’ television advertisements currently aimed at viewers, hitting out at everything from the slew of irresponsible gambling and no win, no fee compensation commercials, to a Sky Broadband advert which features young women swooning over older men. In an amusing but scathing article in this week’s Radio Times, Mr Norman said if aliens were to descend on earth and settle down for a session in front of a TV, they would probably report back to Mars that there is no need to invade judging by the poor quality of adverts. He said: ‘It’s [TV adverts] full of vain, greedy, irresponsible people constantly looking for a fast buck. Oh, and if we do invade, whatever you do keep away from the young women – trust me, you really don’t want to go near them.’ Speaking in the Radio Times, the veteran critic used the example of recent advertisements for Tena Lights incontinence pads, claiming they humiliated women. He said: ‘Some of the most worrisome ads are on daytime TV. ‘There was the one in which a beautiful young woman in a purple dress gets her skirt caught in the closing doors of a lift and scrabbles desperately to retain her modesty while the man she has just met and fancied looks on with amusement. ‘In a sequel the girl, still wearing the same dress and now accompanied by the fancied man, falls out of a taxi, this time revealing her knickers. ‘Golly, what humiliation but no, hang on, it’s okay – because in both instances beneath those knickers she’s wearing an incontinence pad. She may well have wet herself but, such is the efficacy of the pad, the boyfriend will never know. ‘What puzzles me about all this is the advertiser’s apparent conviction that young women today have absolutely no control over their bladders. If so this is surely a matter of grave concern. These women shouldn’t be buying grown-up nappies; they should be seeking urgent consultations with their GPs.’ Baffling: One advert shows a lady with bladder incontinence fall out of a taxi, flashing her underwear to a date... ...but thanks to this purchase, he will never know. Surely, Norman says, she should really be seeking medical help? He added: ‘Even more worrying, though, is the proliferation of commercials for personal injury lawyers, again mostly to be found on daytime telly. Oh dear, you fell over in the street while blind drunk and bumped your nose? Well, somebody’s got to pay for that because you’re not responsible, are you? Nobody can be expected to be responsible for their own actions these days. ‘So lose no time in contacting ambulance-chasers’r’us.com and we’ll make sure somebody coughs up compensation. No win, no fee. And the fee if you do win? Ah, that’s not mentioned. Charles Dickens would have had a load of fun with these guys.’ While he admitted that many adverts left him confused and often unsure of what product they were promoting, he said other were more sinister. Worrying: Personal injury lawyer adverts persuade viewers that any slight tumble is someone else's fault . Our screens are cluttered with actors falling over as other actors earnestly urge us to demand money . He said: ‘Perhaps most disturbing of all are the gambling commercials, which make betting look glamorous and surely appeal most strongly to the poorest and most desperate among us. ‘There’s one in which a good-looking young couple are so eager to watch the telly and see how to lose all their money that they vault over the back of their settee, the more quickly to study the many ways in which they can gamble their life savings away. ‘Even the BBC gets in on the gambling fever by showing the results of the national lottery at a peak hour, just to remind you that here is yet another, ostensibly more respectable, way to get rid of your money.’ Norman presented BBC1’s Film programme . from 1972 until 1998, when he eventually handed over to Jonathan Ross . before moving to Sky. He has . now also admitting to being left ‘bothered’ by a number of other . adverts, two of which shows a young female apparently aroused by older . men. Absurd: Stars like Barbara Windsor are enlisted to star in big-budget commercials promoting gambling . Cashing in: Norman also takes a stab at the BBC for glamorising betting via the Lottery every week . He said: ‘There were the two urging us to subscribe to Sky Broadband that end with either a dressing-gowned Bruce Willis or an equally dressing-gowned Jeff Stelling walking off with a sexually excited girl young enough to be their daughter or even their granddaughter. ‘What’s that all about? Whether it sells much in the way of Sky Broadband I have no idea; the strongest message I receive seems to be that old blokes can still pull young girls but, if you ask me, more fool them if they want to. ‘Then there are the cosmetics ads, particularly those for miracle creams that instantly remove all wrinkles. ‘These end with the models, faces softer and smoother than babies’ bottoms, smiling happily at the camera. Mind you, in most cases they look to be about 19 and might reasonably be supposed not to have had wrinkles in the first place. Nevertheless, once the cream has done its stuff they are unquestionably wrinkle-free. Honoured: Norman, pictured here with his wife and daughters in 1998, was awarded a CBE for his work . ‘I wonder what a visitor from Mars, settling down for a session in front of the telly, would make of all this and of us. I daresay he’d phone home saying: “Look, I don’t think we should bother invading Earth. ‘It’s full of vain, greedy, irresponsible people constantly looking for a fast buck. Oh, and if we do invade, whatever you do keep away from the young women – trust me, you really don’t want to go near them.’ Norman was the face of the BBC’s Film series for more than 20 years. He left in 1998 to become a film critic at Sky, on Barry Norman’s Film Night.  He has also written 10 novels. He was awarded the BAFTA’s Richard Dimbleby Award in 1980, Magazine Columnist of the Year in 1990 and a CBE in 1998. He married wife Diana, a former journalist and author, in 1957. The pair had two daughters before she died in 2011 at the age of 77.","Martians would be baffled by a night of British TV, he tells Radio Times .

Bitterbaum issued an apology in a statement to the community for what he called ;the inexcusable behavior of some of our students.' 'As the president of SUNY Cortland, I would like to personally apologize to the Cortland community for the inexcusable behavior of some of our students related to Saturday's football game with Ithaca College,' college President Erik J. Bitterbaum said in a prepared statement in reaction to what happened after the Cortaca game. 'Please be assured that the College will work closely with city officials to implement measures intended to prevent this type of activity from occurring again,' Bitterbaum wrote. The Cortaca Jug game is part of a longstanding football rivalry between SUNY Cortland and Ithaca College. Cortland won this year's game by four points. The game was held Saturday in Ithaca. The rivalry game draws thousands of students, alumni and other fans to central New York, where the two colleges are just 20 miles apart.

The annual Cortaca game is a time-honored athletic tradition that SUNY Cortland and its alumni take great pride in,' Bitterbaum said in the statement. 'Unfortunately, as we all saw Saturday, the athletic contest has become secondary to the celebration for some students, guests and visitors to the community. As an institution dedicated to academic and athletic excellence we are determined to turn this destructive culture around.' Cortland police say about 30 people had been arrested by Saturday night. State troopers had to be called in to help restore order. Bitterbaum apologized to the community for what he called 'the inexcusable behavior of some of our students.'

Outnumbered: The police were eventually so overrun by the sheer number of students they had to stop arresting people . Police described large crowds that got so big that officers had to stop arresting people and focus on controlling the crowd and restoring order. State police also were called to help. Bitterbaum also said he's been talking to other top college officials to discuss options about what could be done when the event is held in town in the future. 'Together, we will consider any and all ideas as we move forward,' he wrote. 'SUNY Cortland takes pride in maintaining a positive, mutually beneficial relationship with its neighbors and the surrounding community,' Bitterbaum wrote. 'Several years ago, collaboration between the College and the city allowed us to stop the destructive Clayton Avenue block party that used to occur every spring. We are confident we can have a similar impact on the unruly celebrations surrounding Cortaca.' Overwhelmed: Students flooded the streets in a celebration that resulted in nearly three dozen people being arrested . Chaos: Several thousand people were in the streets Saturday to celebrate the 55th annual Cortaca Jug game between Ithaca College and the State University of New York at Cortland.

City regulators who sanctioned a crack cocaine addict to become chief of the Co-operative Bank were yesterday branded ‘a complete disaster’. MPs castigated financial watchdogs for rubber-stamping the appointment of Rev Paul Flowers, which they denounced as a farcical ‘box-ticking exercise’. There is growing incredulity that a man with no banking experience and a penchant for crystal meth and cocaine had been made chairman of a bank. Paul Flowers is being investigated by the police after being caught on film apparently buying hard drugs, including crack cocaine and crystal meth . Co-op last night announced a complete review of the fiasco, as Labour leader Ed Miliband faced questions over hiring Flowers as a business adviser . Rev Flowers, a Methodist minister, was caught on camera buying hard drugs from a car in Leeds a week ago, just days after being grilled by MPs over the disastrous performance of the Co-op. Stung by the revelations, the Co-op last night announced a complete review of the fiasco, as Labour leader Ed Miliband faced questions over hiring Flowers as a business adviser. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons Treasury Select Committee, said it was obvious when Flowers appeared before them earlier this month that he was ‘manifestly unsuitable’ to be a bank chairman. He called for the regulation of senior bankers to be tightened to include continuing and ‘intrusive’ supervision. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons Treasury Select Committee, said it was obvious Flowers was 'manifestly unsuitable' to be a bank chairman . ‘It’s been a complete disaster. Nothing less than saying that will do,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s World At One. He attacked the ‘approved persons regime’, whereby a City panel supposedly checked the competence of Rev Flowers, as ‘nothing more than a massive bureaucratic, back-covering, box-ticking exercise that satisfied regulators but did little or nothing to protect shareholders or customers of banks’. In fact Flowers was only checked by the regulator when he became a member of the Co-op board and was not re-interviewed at all when he was promoted to chairman in April 2010. Flowers quit his post in June this year as his ‘ethical’ bank was driven to the brink of collapse, threatening the retirement incomes of thousands of pensioners. Yesterday he was also suspended by the Labour Party amid embarrassment over a £50,000 donation to Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls. He faces a police inquiry into his use of hard drugs, and the Co-op announced a ‘root and branch review’ into ‘any inappropriate behaviour’ during the tenure of its former boss. As the row grew, the Bank of England was forced to deny its Deputy Governor Andrew Bailey had played any part in the ‘easy’ nature of Flowers’ appointment as the Co-op Bank’s chairman. Flowers had claimed Mr Bailey was on an elite panel of regulators — known as the ‘grey panthers’ — from the now-defunct Financial Services Authority who had approved his appointment. But Mr Bailey strenuously denied his claim, saying he did not even join the FSA until 2011, a year after the Flowers debacle. David Ruffley, another member of the Treasury Select Committee, demanded that regulators be hauled in to give evidence. Flowers quit his post in June this year as his 'ethical' bank was driven to the brink of collapse, threatening the retirement incomes of thousands of pensioners . Describing the downfall of the Co-op Bank as a ‘Greek tragedy’, he said: ‘Clearly someone who was manifestly not up to the job of oversight slipped through the net.’ Another Treasury Select Committee member, Jesse Norman, told Channel 4 News: ‘This man had no experience of running any other business yet for political reasons within the Co-operative movement he finds himself at the head of the Co-op bank.’ At the weekend, Flowers, 63, apologised ‘to all I have hurt or failed by my actions’ over the revelations in the Mail on Sunday. He has also been suspended by the Methodist Church.","Rev Paul Flowers, a Methodist minister, caught on camera buying drugs .

Charge: A think-tank suggests the NHS could use money earned from GP visits towards opening hours . Patients should be charged £10 a night to stay in hospital and £10 every time they see their GP, according to a think-tank. It also wants to raise prescription fees, make dying patients pay for end-of-life care and impose £10 fines for every missed appointment. Reform, an independent think-tank, says the charges could be used to improve certain NHS services such as funding surgeries to open at weekends. It also claims the fees are ‘unavoidable’ as the NHS is incurring billions of debts footing the bill for the care of the aging population. But campaigners fear such charges will unfairly penalise the elderly and those with long-term conditions and may deter them from seeking help. Estimates show the health service will have annual debts of £30billion by 2020 and there are growing concerns that standards are far worse compared to other countries in Europe. Around two-thirds of Western countries charge patients to see their GP ranging from 80p in France to £18 in Sweden, with an extra £5 for a home visit. And half make patients pay for hospitals visits or stays including Sweden where they are £7.50 per night and Portugal which makes them pay £8 every time they go to A&E. Thomas Cawston, research director at the think-tank said: ‘The Government must find a way of generating more money for the NHS. ‘We currently have a system which is very generous. ‘A lot of people who are reasonably well off wouldn’t mind paying £10 for a GP appointment on a Saturday morning, for example.’ ‘Few will want to debate higher NHS charges but the funding outlook for the service makes it unavoidable. Prescription charges are the easiest route to new revenue, with exemptions for people on low incomes built in.’ The think-tank also recommends charging patients £10 for every night they spend in hospital and would consider making them pay for unnecessary A&E visits. Poll: More than half of GPs are in favour of the change, with some suggesting charges of up to £25 . It would also raise prescription costs from £7.85 to £10 and make the elderly and pregnant women pay - currently they are exempt from charges. Controversially, it wants to impose a means-tested system for end of life care meaning the majority of dying patients would pay for pain relief and extra nursing. This summer a poll found that half of GPs are in favour of charging patients for appointments - with some wanting to impose fees of between £5 and £25 a time. A poll of 440 GPs by Pulse magazine found that 51 per cent were in favour of making patients pay to deter them for turning up unnecessarily. One, Dr Shailendra Bhatt, a GP in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, said: ‘I work in a walk-in centre. ‘The amount of people who come through the door for practically no reason at all and say “I was out and saw this sign for a walk-in centre where one can see a doctor, so I came in.” ‘People don’t value the things if they get it cheap, worse still if they get it for nothing.’","More than half of doctors polled were in favour, with some suggesting £25 .

It was a night to sip fine wine and puff on fat cigars, savouring the rewards of a job well done. And as the crème-de-la-crème of Britain’s bailiffs loosened their belts and bow ties after a lavish dinner at a four-star hotel in Manchester, it was time for the evening's big winners to step into the spotlight. As this was the Debt Collection Awards 2013, there should have been plenty of potential for unusual gongs. Lavish: The Debt Collection Awards, held at the four-star Midland Hotel in Manchester - where rooms cost up to £379 a night - was organised by Credit Today magazine and is now in its seventh year . Entrance: The event last Wednesday was said by organisers to 'recognise the industry¿s outstanding efforts and commitment to best practice' and give more than 500 people in the industry the chance to network . In attendance: Police officers were called to deal with a group of protesters but no arrests were made . Sadly, categories at the event dubbed the Bailiff Oscars did not include Britain’s Best Granny Harasser, Fastest Door Dispenser and Giant . Telly Seizer Of The Year.

The women were released after a judge deemed 1998 witness testimony faulty . Faulty testimony: The three were convicted with Anna Vasquez in 1998 of assaulting two girls aged 7 and 9, in 1994.

The women have not been exonerated formally, but Bexar County prosecutors have said they do not intend to retry them if the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals vacates the convictions. The three and their attorneys were expected to describe their next steps in their pursuit of exoneration later this week. However, prosecutors do not agree with Mike Ware, one of the attorneys for the women, that they should be declared formally innocent - a distinction that would allow them to collect money Texas pays to the wrongfully imprisoned. The women's release was delayed for about six hours by paperwork issues with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The three were convicted with Anna Vasquez in 1998 of assaulting two of Ramirez's nieces, ages 7 and 9, in successive attacks during a week in 1994. The girls testified that the women held them by their wrists and ankles, attacked them and threatened to kill them.

Ramirez was given a 37-year prison sentence. Mayhugh, Vasquez and Rivera were given 15-year sentences. Vasquez had already been paroled. Their case came to the attention of attorneys affiliated with the non-profit Innocence Project of Texas more than a decade after the women were imprisoned. The group investigates potential wrongful conviction cases and Ware, who has worked on the case for two years, filed petitions on the women's behalf last month with the state appeals court. They were convicted based on an expert's testimony that a vaginal injury sustained by the 9-year-old girl could have been caused by an assault. According to a petition filed by Ware, Dr. Nancy Kellogg testified that the injury in question happened around the time of the alleged assaults. But her conclusions have since been discredited by current findings on science, attorneys have said. Kellogg declined an interview request from The Associated Press last week. Texas has passed several laws to add new safeguards for eyewitness identification, DNA testing and other issues in response to a rash of wrongful-conviction cases.

It's like a dream come true.’ Herrera said she and her daughter hadn't decided what they would do when Ramirez went free - other than she knew Ramirez wanted a pizza. ‘In the beginning there was no hope but this day has finally arrived,’ Herrera said. ‘I pray that this doesn't happen to anybody else.’","Elizabeth Ramirez, Kristie Mayhugh and Cassandra Rivera, all of San Antonio were released Monday after a judge vacated their 1998 conviction for the sexual assault of two young children .

"By . Jack Doyle and Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:52 EST, 19 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:28 EST, 19 November 2013 . Security firm G4S has admitted overcharging taxpayers by more than £24million for ‘phantom’ electronic tags that had been removed – or were never fitted in the first place. But the Government yesterday refused to accept its offer of a ‘credit note’ for the sum and is expected to draw up its own bill once an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office is concluded. It is thought that G4S, and another tagging firm Serco, overcharged for tens of thousands of criminals, including those who had left the country, been returned to prison or even died. Ministers fear taxpayers could have overpaid two private companies for their work tagging criminals . G4S said its investigation had ‘not identified any evidence of dishonesty or criminal conduct’ by any of its staff. A spokesman said it accepted it ‘wrongly considered itself to be contractually entitled to bill for monitoring services when equipment had not been fitted or after it had been removed’. The credit note issued yesterday was for £23.3million for bills wrongly issued between 2005, when the contracts began, and May this year. The firm said another note would follow for £800,000 for bills wrongly issued from June this year. This indicates the company continued to overcharge even after the Ministry of Justice announced its investigation into billing practices in May. Probe: Global security firm G4S is to be investigated by the Serious Fraud Office over tagging contacts dating back more than a decade . A National Audit Office report into the electronic monitoring contracts published today found evidence the firms were charging for multiple tags on individual criminals. In one case Serco charged more than £15,000 for monitoring an offender whose home was not even fitted with the equipment. A spokesman said Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has been clear that he is 'determined to secure a refund for the taxpayer'. The UK-based security firm traces its roots back to a guarding company founded in Denmark in 1901. G4S was formed when Group 4 merged with Securicor in 2004. The company has a long record of blunders including: . In 1993 Group 4 became the first private company to run prisoner escort services,m and lost seven inmates in three weeks . A year later a hunger striker escaped from Campsfield House detention centre, guarded by Group 4 . In 1997 it emerged the firm had transferred a prisoner between two vans on a petrol station forecourt . Three prisoners escaped from Peterborough Crown Court in 2001 . In . 2011, G4S staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over . Birmingham Prison Workers put an electronic tag on criminal Christopher . Lowcock's artificial limb . In 2012 the firm failed to train enough guards for the London Games which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave . In March this year a G4S guard at Heathrow ordered Royal Navy engineer Nicky Howse to change out . of her uniform before flying to the US because it was 'offensive' The spokesman added: 'We have taken appropriate legal advice and will pursue all possible avenues. 'This matter is now the subject of a criminal investigation. We are not able to comment further at the current time. We will make a further statement when it is appropriate to do so.' G4S refused to co-operate with a forensic audit of its work - and that of fellow contractor Serco - which a public spending watchdog revealed had already cost the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) more than £2 million. The firm said it now accepted it had ‘wrongly considered itself to be contractually entitled to bill for monitoring services when equipment had not been fitted or after it had been removed’. It said: ‘This billing practice ... was not consistent with the contract or G4S’s values and the company has apologised to the Ministry of Justice and issued credit notes totalling £23.3 million for amounts incorrectly billed between 2005 and May 2013. ‘A further credit note of £0.8 million will be issued for billings for the period from June 2013 to date.’ There was no evidence that it extended to any of its other Government contracts, said the firm, which has faced repeated criticism of its performance, not least over security for the 2012 Olympics. G4S group chief executive Ashley Almanza said the offer was ‘an important step in setting this matter straight and restoring the trust which has been earned by our many thousands of committed and hard-working employees over many years’. G4S UK and Ireland chief executive Richard Morris will face questions from MPs over the scandal tomorrow when he appears before the Commons public accounts committee. Public and Commercial Services union general secretary Mark Serwotka said: ‘Privatisation has been imposed on the public with the lie that it is more efficient and saves us money. ‘As well as raking in billions of pounds of our money, these companies are shielded from public scrutiny and are almost entirely unaccountable. ‘Who knows how many more times we have been ripped off?’ Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said the admission by G4S was 'staggering' Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: 'The admission of G4S today is staggering. 'The company refused to co-operate with the Government, which led to the referral to the SFO, and that should have rung alarm bells. It represents serious corporate failure. 'Contracts of this kind need to be conducted in good faith and represent value for money. Every G4S contract with the Government needs to be reviewed immediately, and they should be banned from bidding for any more. 'After the Olympic shambles, the Home Affairs Select Committee recommended that the Government implement a high-risk register to stop this happening again. 'Had it been adopted, the overbilling from June may have been prevented.' The firms will be billed for the £2million cost of the audit that uncovered the overcharging.","G4S admits wrongly billing for non-existent tags and apologises .

Andrew Huber was changing little Kenley's diaper in August 2012 when he heard a pop. He and his wife Bria Huber rushed the child to a Dallas hospital where doctors discovered she had a broken leg, but also noticed other broken bones and Mr Huber was eventually arrested for child abuse. Both parents were in shock. Scroll down for video . Wrongly accused: Andrew Huber, right, was arrested after breaking his and wife Bria's daughter Kenley's leg in August 2012 while changing her diaper . Rare disease: But it turned out Kenley, pictured left, has a rare bone disease that causes her fragile bones to break. Finally, Mr Huber, pictured right in his mug shot, was cleared . 'Halfway through my police interview, they told me that they believed that Andrew had been systematically abusing Kenley and her fractures were at varying stages of healing,' Mrs Huber told KHOU.com. 'I had been married to this monster that I never met.' But this conclusion just didn't make sense, particularly as Kenley's pediatrician had never seen any problems and the family's nanny reported seeing no signs of abuse. 'I had to step back and intellectualize and say could this have even happened,' Mrs Huber said. 'Let me not be blinded by my love but let me go through and make sure I'm doing everything to protect our daughter.' Confused: Mrs Huber, right, didn't believe that her husband, left, was a monster when police told her of the alleged abuse . Sad: Mr Huber was kept away from his daughter, Kenley, for 14 months while police investigated why her bones were breaking . So while Mr Huber was in and out of court, she took Kenley to specialists across the United States, searching for answers. Eventually, the family came across another mother named Rana Tyson whose twin girls had been removed from her until a geneticist named Dr. Golder Wilson diagnosed them with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or EDS. 'One of the main symptoms is the underlying structure of the body, including the bones and joints, is fragile. So you get more fractures,' Dr. Wilson told KHOU. Rare condition: While Mr Huber was in and out of court, Mrs Huber took Kenley, pictured left and right, to specialists across the United States, searching for answers . Relief: Now the family is all back together after the diagnosis . 'And therefore, just handling a baby routinely, like any parent would do, can lead to a fracture.' Kenley and Mrs Huber were both diagnosed with EDS, though the mother said she had never heard of the disease. Thankfully, the discovery also set Mr Huber free, after more than a year spent away from his wife and daughter. 'Right now it's just a joy to be back home and have the house,' Mr Huber said. 'That's far outweighing the anger. The happiness to have my girls back.'","Texas dad Andrew Huber was arrested for abusing his daughter Kenley in August 2012 after her leg broke while she was changing her diaper .

Jailed: Travis Scott, 36, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison after faking his own death . A convicted fraudster who faked his own suicide by leaving a shotgun and suicide note in a canoe splattered with his blood has been sentenced to 12 years and eight months in prison. Travis Scott, from Eden Prairie, Minnesota, hatched the elaborate plan to fake his own death and then escape to Canada in 2011 to avoid a prison sentence for a $11.5 million insurance scam. He ground up some of his wisdom teeth, pulled strands of hair from his head and drew several pints of blood before leaving it in a stocking cap that he placed in the canoe on Lake Mille Lacs. Three days later, authorities came across the cap alongside a shotgun and a suicide note, which explained Scott had also weighed down his body so it would sink. In fact, he had escaped on an airplane he had bought under an assumed name, flying out from a nearby airport in the middle of the night, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. He . flew into an unsupervised airport near . Winnipeg and rented a hangar under a fake name He . then hiked into Winnipeg, rented an apartment, got a cat and bought a computer and a Jeep. Then using Canadian death notices, he was able to obtain the birth certificate of a baby who had died aged two. He used the name to create a fake ID . badge based on one worn by a cable TV installer who came to his . apartment. With the ID, he was able to get a driver's license. He was waiting for a passport to travel to Australia or Belize when he was . caught using faked prescriptions for anxiety pills at a pharmacy. Scene: He had left blood, hair, a gun and a suicide note behind in a canoe on Lake Mille Lacs in 2011 - before fleeing to Canada where he assumed the identity of a dead child . Eighty-two days after he faked his suicide, he was arrested and his real identity was discovered. On Monday, Scott was sentenced to 12 years and eight months in prison by U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank in St. Paul, the Star Tribune reported. In a statement before the sentencing, the 36-year-old fraudster said that if he were released he . could use his technological skills to reimburse the money he stole. But Tim Rank, the federal prosecutor, said that Scott was 'a manipulative person'. 'There is very little question that the defendant will engage in fraud once again whenever he is released from prison,' prosecutors said in court filings. Authorities explained that they quickly learned that the suicide was a ruse. Scott had left a bullet in the chamber of the shotgun, which would only have been there if the gun had been pumped - ejecting the casing - after firing. Police deduced this would have been impossible if he had shot himself in the upper body. They also noted that no vehicle had been left nearby that Scott would have used to get there. Then finally, they learned he was facing prison for fraud. 'It became very evident very soon this is likely an individual who wants everyone to believe he died, and had gone through an extravagant effort to make us believe it,' Mille Lacs County Sheriff Bruce Lindgren said. 'The likelihood that he had committed suicide was remote.' The faked suicide came after Scott pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering for filing a false claim with insurance company, Zurich North America. He faced five to 10 years in prison. He had claimed that his supercomputers were damaged by a lightning strike and was awarded $9.5 million in losses and $1.9 million for business interruption. He allegedly bought three airplanes, cars, a $700,000 house and a $300,000 yacht. The court will now oversee forfeiture of Scott's property. He is responsible for restitution of $11,517,772.20.","Travis Scott, 36, faked his death in 2011 by leaving wisdom teeth, hair strands, blood, a suicide note and a shotgun in a canoe on a lake .

Trial: Anxiang Du, 54, allegedly said 'blackness' came over him as he carried out the brutal stabbings . A man accused of murdering a family of four told a psychiatrist that ‘blackness’ came over him as he carried out the brutal stabbings, a court heard today. Anxiang Du, 54, is accused of knifing Manchester Metropolitan University lecturer Jifeng ‘Jeff’ Ding, his wife Ge ‘Helen’ Chui, and their two daughters, Xing ‘Nancy’, 18, and Alice, 12, at their home in Wootton, Northamptonshire. During his trial which began last week, a jury has heard he carried out the stabbings following a long-running legal dispute after a business relationship turned sour. After the April 2011 killings, Du, who denies four counts of murder, fled to Morocco where he was eventually arrested and extradited back to the UK, at Northampton Crown Court heard. Today Professor Nigel Eastman, a forensic psychiatrist, told jurors he interviewed Du in prison in August last year after he was brought back to Britain to face four charges of murder. Giving evidence for the defence today, Mr Eastman told the court Mr Du had given him an account of the events that had unfolded on the day of the killings in 2011. Mr Eastman said Du thought about going . to see the Dings after seeing a knife in a bag in his shop in . Birmingham on the morning of April 29, 2011. Dead: Du, 54, is accused of knifing (from left) Manchester Metropolitan University lecturer Jifeng 'Jeff' Ding, his wife Ge 'Helen' Chui, and their two daughters, Xing 'Nancy', 18, and Alice, 12, at their home . The . court heard Du had taken the knife to his shop previously with the . thought that he may take his own life. Mr Eastman said Du told him he . had wanted to get the Dings to give back the money. Mr . Eastman told the court: ‘He said “I wanted to get them to give back the . money. It is why I carried the bag. I picked up the bag with the knife . in it at that stage”.’ 'At the time my heart was feeling hopeless. There was a very strong feeling of no way out' What Anxiang Du 'told psychiatrist' The psychiatrist had asked Du whether he had thought about causing the Dings harm. Mr . Eastman told the court: ‘He replied “possibly”. I then asked him what . possibly meant. He said “If they don’t give me the money then I would do . that to harm them”.’ The psychiatrist had then asked Du whether he had the intention to kill the Dings if they had not given him money. Mr . Du replied: ‘I think that if the Dings had apologised to me I probably . would not have done that. Throughout they never apologised.’ Mr Eastman told the jury he then asked Mr Du whether he had thought in advance about killing the Dings. House: Du told a psychiatrist that he had become 'uncontrollably distressed and sobbed' when he saw the two daughters in the bedroom of the home in Wootton, Northamptonshire, the court heard . ‘He . said “I did not have such forethought. I did not think so far ahead. If . I had I probably would never have gone there. At the time my heart was . feeling hopeless. There was a very strong feeling of no way out”.’ Du . said that when he arrived at the Dings house in Wootton he went through . the garage as the family had never answered the front door in the past . when he had rung the doorbell. Mr . Eastman went on: ‘He told me he went into the garden and saw Mr Ding . through the kitchen window and then he went into the kitchen.’ Du told Mr Eastman he had asked Mr Ding for money but that he could not remember how much. Mr . Eastman said Du told him: ‘Mr Ding said I was stupid and a fool. His . facial expression was one of mocking. He ordered me to leave. I think he . also said he would call the police. ‘I . did not say anything. I withdrew the knife from the bag. I was not . thinking anything. My mind was blank.’ Mr Eastman then said Du told him . he felt he saw ‘blackness’ and that Mr Ding’s appearance was distorted . and ‘ugly’. The psychiatrist . said the evidence demonstrated Mr Du was in a ‘high state of arousal’ at the time he carried out the killings but did not fully support the . basis of diminished responsibility. Mr Ding (left) was a lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University while his wife Helen (right) was a translator . Mr . Eastman continued: ‘He (Du) said another person came and grabbed my arm . so I pointed the knife at her then they fell. He said he had stabbed Mr . Ding to the body and his wife but did not continue when they fell to . the ground. 'I did not hate them (the daughters) at all. I don’t know why. I am so sorry' What Anxiang Du 'told psychiatrist' ‘He told me he . did not know how many times he had stabbed them both.’ Du told the . psychiatrist that he went upstairs ‘after hearing a noise’. He . told Mr Eastman that he had become ‘uncontrollably distressed and . sobbed’ when he saw the two daughters in the bedroom. ‘I also killed . them, I don’t know why,’ Du told Mr Eastman. Mr . Eastman asked him whether he had any hatred for the two children. Du . replied: ‘I did not hate them at all. I don’t know why. I am so sorry.’ He . added that he did not resent the daughters, saying: ‘I do not have any . such feelings. It was a big sin, me killing them. I was not thinking of . anything.’ Du told him he could not remember which daughter he had stabbed first or how many times he had attacked each of them. Deaths: Sisters Xing 'Nancy' Ding (left) and Alice (right) were also killed in the attack, the court has been told . ‘The . next thing I remember is I laid down and slept then it was dark . already. I did not know what time it was then I saw a wallet with money . in it and car keys and decided to escape.’ Mr Eastman said he asked Du why he wanted to escape and he had replied: ‘I don’t know. I wanted to run away.’ The . bodies of Mr and Mrs Ding were found downstairs in the kitchen of their . home, and Alice and Nancy were found dead in an upstairs bedroom on May . 1, 2011, two days after the brutal killings. Post-mortem tests showed Mr Ding had been stabbed 23 times, Mrs Ding 13 times, Nancy had 11 stab wounds and Alice had four. Prosecutors . allege Du stabbed the Ding family in order to ‘avenge himself’ after . their business relationship in Chinese medicine broke down and he ended . up owing £88,000 in costs following a lengthy legal battle between the . two families. William . Harbage QC, prosecuting, has told jurors that there was no argument that . Du was responsible for the killings but the defendant would claim he . should only be convicted of manslaughter on the basis of either . diminished responsibility or loss of control.

Warning: Planning minister Nick Boles warned the Tories will struggle to win without wooing voters who feel unable to vote Conservative at present . One of David Cameron’s closest allies has admitted the Tories are unable to win votes outside the South East and among young people because they are still seen as the ‘party of the rich’. Nick Boles said some of the electorate like the party’s policies ‘but they don’t trust our motives’, and that a way had to be found to convince these voters that Conservatives ‘are not aliens from another planet’. In an attack on the Tory Right, the Planning Minister admitted Mr Cameron’s attempts to detoxify the Tories’ image have failed after eight years at the helm. He said the Prime Minister should ‘shout from the rooftops’ about liberal policies such as gay marriage if he wants to win the next election. He even called for the creation of a new National Liberal Party to attract under-25s and suggested Tory MPs could run on joint tickets to boost support. Mr Boles was one of the first Tories to encourage David Cameron to change his party’s image when he became leader in 2005. But speaking at the Bright Blue Tory think tank yesterday he admitted the old caricature of the Conservatives as the party of the better off has not changed. He said: ‘The single biggest factor preventing people voting Conservative is the perception that we are the party of the rich. We have not done enough to reassure people about our motives.’ Mr Boles conceded that the Tories . will struggle to win a majority because ‘a significant number of people . will not even contemplate voting Conservative’. He argues young voters . will only back the Tories if the party campaigns on socially liberal . policies including allowing gay marriage. ‘We . should not shy away from those achievements but shout them from the . rooftops,’ Mr Boles said. ‘They should make us proud. Having taken the . pain, not to be proud of them is completely pointless. Trouble: David Cameron, pictured in Downing Street this morning, rejected the idea of a new party . Mr Boles went on: ‘This new group of voters represents a fantastic opportunity for our party. But we have no hope of securing their support if we approach them with the same proposition that we use to woo our stalwart supporters.’ Mr Boles said that failing to understand that will lead to the party ‘being pushed back into rural and suburban redoubt in the south of England’. His intervention comes after Sir John . Major said it was ‘truly shocking’ that a public school elite still runs . Britain – comments widely interpreted as a reference to figures such as . Mr Boles who went to public school Winchester before Oxford. The former . prime minister also warned Conservatives that pursuing a ‘core vote’ strategy would deliver the Tories ‘the wooden spoon’ on 2015. Coalition: Mr Boles noted that Michael Heseltine, pictured, stood as a National Liberal before the party formally merged with the Conservatives in the 1960s . Mr Boles once argued for a longstanding coalition between Tories and Liberal Democrats. But he said: ‘I did not realise that our coalition partners would do everything in their power to paint us as heartless extremists. And I underestimated the readiness of some in the Conservative party, and the press, to play up to the caricature and thereby fall squarely into their trap.’ Mr Boles said the Tories should reform the National Liberal Party, a ticket on which Michael Heseltine once stood in the 1950s, just as some Labour MPs are simultaneously members of the Co-op party. But the idea was rejected by Tory high command. A Downing Street source said: ‘This is not supported by No 10. It is not going to happen.’","Planning minister Nick Boles calls for a revival of National Liberal Party .

Binge drinking among teenagers has led to a ‘meteoric’ rise in alcohol-related deaths, a leading doctor warned yesterday. Professor Ian Gilmore said too many children were getting drunk on a regular basis – and some of them would die in their twenties as a result. Sir Ian, who is the country’s leading authority on liver disease, has called for urgent government action and accused David Cameron of backing down over minimum pricing per unit and other controls. Under age girls Gussy Sveaas 15, (left) and Libby Morrison 14, (right) had no problem getting served when they took part in a bar crawl experiment . ‘It is tragic to see young people . coming into hospital and dying of alcohol-related liver disease,’ said . the president of the British Society of Gastroenterology. ‘Liver . specialists are seeing people as young as in their 20s dying due to . alcohol.’ Sir Ian said . he was concerned by the number of people drinking while their brains . were still developing: ‘We could see up to a quarter of a million . preventable deaths from liver disease in the next 20 years.’ Speaking . at a conference in London hosted by the charity Alcohol Concern, the . professor said a recorded four-fold rise in deaths from liver disease . was ‘meteoric’. Cirrhosis claimed 1,200 lives a year in 1970 but the toll in 2010 was 5,000 and rising. The . UK and Ireland are the only Western European countries where deaths . from liver diseases are on the increase. ‘No other disease has shown . anything like this,’ added Sir Ian. The conference also heard that alcohol-related admissions to UK hospitals are at an all-time high of 1.2million a year. According . to a survey carried out in 2011, 30 per cent of girls and 25 per cent . of boys reported being drunk in the previous 30 days. Prof Gilmore said he was ‘very encouraged when David Cameron as Prime Minister made a personal commitment to the value of bringing in a minimum unit price for alcohol’. But he added that he had since been disappointed that the promise appeared to have been dropped. ‘I am aware that in politics there are difficult decisions and trade-offs,’ he said. ‘My guess is that factors for the change of position would be pressure from the drinks industry and concerns from MPs that the person who is not well off and drinks responsibly would be disadvantaged. ‘The Secretary of State, Jeremy Hunt, is not following the evidence on how we can reduce alcohol-related liver diseases in terms of availability, promotion and pricing of alcohol. ‘Instead, regulation is getting laxer - we hear the Government is considering changes to licensing laws so people can get a gin and tonic when having their hair cut.’ Prof Gilmore said minimum prices per unit would not affect the cost of drinks in pubs or restaurants - and only mean a slight increase for moderate drinkers. And he said an experimental ban on bulk discounts for alcohol has seen a 4.5 per cent decrease in wine sales over 12 months to October 2012. As well as minimum pricing, Prof Gilmore suggested district hospitals should create Alcohol Care Teams to work with people admitted with drink-related conditions and help them reduce their consumption. Prof Gilmore said these teams could save £1.6 million a year by reducing future admissions at a cost of £600,000 a year per hospital.","Expert has criticised David Cameron over minimum pricing .

A Los Angeles judge has rejected a bid by Casey Kasem's daughter to establish a conservatorship for the ailing radio personality. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lesley Green however urged lawyers today to reach an agreement that would allow three of Kasem's adult children to visit their father. Kasem's children, Kerrie, Julie and Mike Kasem have said they are being blocked from seeing their father by their father's wife, Jean. Kasey Casem (second from right) pictured with his son Mike Casem and daughters Kerri Casem (second from left) and Julie Kasem (right) in 2003 . Marshall Grossman, an attorney for Jean Kasem, says a proposal for visits by the children has been rejected, but they will work to reach an agreement. Court records state Kasem is suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease. A representative of his wife announced on October 19 that Casey will die in the next few months . The 81-year-old gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, American Top 40 and Casey's Top 40, and was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon Scooby Doo. His children Kerri, Julie and Mike Kasem staged a very public protest outside their father’s home in October to publicize their concerns for his well-being and to accuse their step-mother Jean Kasem, 59, of blocking them from seeing their father. Julie Kasem then filed a petition for a temporary conservatorship, to have someone placed in charge of the legendary radio host's affairs who would give regular updates to a judge. Jean Kasem has hit back at her husband's children from his first marriage and claims she and Casey, pictured here in 2007, have been helping to fund their lifestyles for many years . She and her siblings said the legal action wasn't about money – as they've already been cut out of his will - and is purely about concern for his well-being. But that story was contradicted by legal documents filed by their stepmom who insists she is taking great care of her ailing husband and continues to give him manicures and pedicures, reports TMZ. The legal documents also reveal that she and Casey have loaned his children approximately $100,000-$150,000 per year for many years to pay for their school, housing, cars, parking tickets, travel, etc. She also cited an example of a $50,000 loan that she claims was given to Julie back in 2000 and which has never been repaid. Lawyers for Jean Kasem also argued that if there is a need for a conservator, it should be his wife. In October, court-appointed Attorney Samuel Ingham told Judge Roy Paul that he had visited Kasem and did not see an immediate need for a conservatorship, although he did admit that he still lacked information about Kasem's doctors and treatments. Kasem, who lives with his wife of 33 years, Jean, and their adult daughter, was checked out by police detectives and social services workers, said Marshall Grossman, an attorney for Mrs Kasem. Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, 'American Top 40' and 'Casey's Top 40,' and was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon 'Scooby Doo' Casey Kasem and wife Jean have been married for 33 years . Grossman urged Paul to reject Julie Kasem's petition, saying the effort was detrimental to his client and the radio host. A . 2007 document that appointed Julie Kasem as an overseer of her father's . medical care had been superseded by 2011 estate planning documents, . said Grossman, who filed the records in court in October. Grossman called the new documents . ‘bulletproof’ and in a court filing wrote that the radio host's . intention was to receive medical care in his home. In a sworn declaration, Jean Kasem wrote that the actions of her step-children, including press conferences, accusations she is holding her husband hostage, and the filing of the conservatorship case, have been a ‘living nightmare.’ She wrote that her husband was bedridden and receives around-the-clock care from medical professionals. ‘It is my sincere hope that Casey's physical surroundings coupled with the attentiveness of the medical providers and the love of his own home and wife and child are comforting to him,’ Jean Kasem wrote. Paul refused to dismiss the case, noting that Ingham had requested additional information about medical care. The judge noted, however, that it did not appear that any court intervention was necessary to ensure Kasem was receiving proper care. In October Kasem's children and other friends staged a very public protest outside his home to publicize their concerns for his well-being and to accuse their step-mother Jean Kasem, 59, of blocking them from seeing him .","A judge rejected bid by Kasem's daughter for a conservatorship .

Warning: David Willetts said there had been a significant increase in grant applications from Romanian and Bulgarian students . Colleges have been hit with a surge in applications from Romanians and Bulgarians wanting taxpayer-funded loans and grants to study in this country. More than 5,000 students from the two countries enrolled on vocational courses in England last year – accounting for a staggering one in six of all applicants – with many entitled to up to £10,000 in grants and loans. Yesterday leaked documents exposed government concerns over 'weaknesses' in checks on applicants, prompting fears of potential mass fraud. Ministers have now announced a freeze on new grants and revealed all applicants from the EU had been asked for extra evidence they were eligible for the cash. One college – which officials have refused to name – has had all its funding stopped while an investigation is carried out. Experts also raised fears that Romanian and Bulgarian students could make cash in hand at the expense of the taxpayer while studying for these courses, which officials admit have less stringent entrance criteria. Currently students from the two countries are allowed to work limited hours in the UK but can avoid checks if they are self-employed or take black market jobs. But from January 1 they will have full rights to live and work here when EU controls expire. Overall, numbers enrolling for higher national diplomas (HNDs) and certificates (HNCs) have more than doubled from 13,000 to 30,000 in only 12 months. The rush of applications has left an £80million blackhole in the finances of the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, which is responsible for higher education. Officials have written to all EU applicants asking for evidence of their eligibility. But nearly three quarters are yet to respond. The applications surge has apparently caught officials unprepared, and half of colleges have been sent a letter this week telling them to cap student numbers. HNDs are equivalent to two years' study on a university course and can be used to gain entry to a university in England and Wales. HNCs are equal to one year of study in higher education. The vocational qualifications can be taken in subjects including hair and beauty management, coaching and sporting development and applied biology. EU residents can apply for a loan of up to £6,000 to cover the cost of tuition fees. Those already living in the UK are also entitled to a maximum £3,400 maintenance loan for living costs. Applications: The Government has told 23 colleges to cut the numbers of students they recruit (file picture) Around four in ten students receiving . financial support for the qualifications are from abroad, compared to . just one in 20 in higher education generally. Details . of the problem emerged in a letter from chief executive of the Students . Loans Company, Mick Laverty, to a senior official at the Department for . Business. He said: 'There . may be legitimate reasons for this [surge] but as the weaknesses . identified in the residency check process for Romanian and Bulgarian . students may also be exploited by students from other European nations, . these numbers are cause for concern.' Professor . Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment . Research at the University of Buckingham, said the courses provide a . convenient route to government funding, adding: 'The students could be . working in the black economy because the courses are not as demanding as . degrees.' Sir Andrew . Green, chairman of MigrationWatch said: 'This is a remarkably large . number.

The White House released a letter Tuesday handwritten by President Obama and dedicated to the memory of Abraham Lincoln and his historic Gettysburg Address. Just like the unforgettable speech, Obama’s letter contains 272 words and became public on the 150th anniversary of the day Lincoln honored the soldiers who died in the Civil War bloodbath. It also comes at a time when Obama is facing disastrous approval ratings and amid criticism he’s taken for choosing not to attend a Gettysburg memorial. Scroll down to read the transcript... Honoring a leader: The White House released a handwritten essay President Obama wrote commemorating Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Like Lincoln's speech, Obama's address has exactly 272 words . Four score and 70 years ago: Tuesday was the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's historic speech. Obama has faced criticism for not attending a memorial at the historic battlefield and for omitting 'under God' during a recitation of the address . Obama has also been attacked for failing to say the words ‘under God’ during a recent recitation of the address. But the letter, which Obama seems to have written himself, appears to be an means of laying to rest any possibility that the president has anything but respect and admiration for the Great Emancipator. ‘I sometimes walk down the hall to a room Abraham Lincoln used as his office,’ the letter reads. ‘It contains an original copy of the Gettysburg Address, written in Lincoln's own hand.’ In his own handwritten script, Obama highlights an excerpt from Lincoln’s speech that he most often lingers on: A new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. ‘Lincoln grasped, perhaps more than anyone, the burdens required to give these words meaning,’ the President writes. ‘He understood as well that our humble efforts, our individual ambitions, are ultimately not what matter; rather, it is through the accumulated toil and sacrifice of ordinary men and women…that this country is built, and freedom preserved.’ Obama, whose spokesman claims he was reading from a so-called ‘Nicholay copy,’ of the address when he omitted a shout out to God, finishes his letter with a nod to healing wounds. ‘But Lincoln's words give us confidence that whatever trials avoid us, this nation and the freedom we cherish can, and shall, prevail.’ In the evening, when Michelle and the girls have gone to bed, I sometimes walk down the hall to a room Abraham Lincoln used as his office. It contains an original copy of the Gettysburg Address, written in Lincoln's own hand.I linger on these few words that have helped define our American experiment: ""a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.""Through the lines of weariness etched in his face, we know Lincoln grasped, perhaps more than anyone, the burdens required to give these words meaning. He knew that even a self evident truth was not self executing; that blood drawn by the lash was an affront to our ideals; that blood drawn by the sword was in painful service to those same ideals.He understood as well that our humble efforts, our individual ambitions, are ultimately not what matter; rather, it is through the accumulated toil and sacrifice of ordinary men and women -- those like the soldiers who consecrated that battlefield -- that this country is built, and freedom preserved. This quintessentially self made man, fierce in his belief in honest work and the striving spirit at the heart of America, believed that it falls to each generation, collectively, to share in that toil and sacrifice.Through cold war and world war, through industrial revolutions and technological transformations, through movements for civil rights and women's rights and workers rights and gay rights, we have. At times, social and economic change have strained our union. But Lincoln's words give us confidence that whatever trials avoid us, this nation and the freedom we cherish can, and shall, prevail.","The essay, released Tuesday on the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's historic speech, is the exact length of the Gettysburg Address: 272 words .

The Church of England could have its first woman bishop by 2015 after opponents backed down following months of pressure from politicians. Members of the General Synod, the church’s ruling body, yesterday voted by 378-8 in favour of plans that will pave the way for women to be promoted to the senior rank within two years. Referring to the failure of opponents to win public support, Canon Rosie Harper, of Oxford, said in the Synod debate: ‘People out there don’t care enough to be angry, but they do dismiss us as weird. If we are serious about our mission, we really have to stop being weird.’ Changes: Canon Rosie Harper, who made a speech during the Synod, said people outside the church thought the ongoing argument over discrimination was 'weird' Under the scheme, an ombudsman will . decide on disputes when traditionalists refuse to accept a woman . bishop’s authority. Clergy who fail to abide by the advice will face . disciplinary action. Yesterday’s vote was almost exactly a . year since an alliance of conservative evangelicals and Anglo-Catholics . voted to halt the progress of women bishops. The ‘train crash’ vote, as one Church . leader called it, provoked threats from ministers to force the Church’s . hand and a warning from David Cameron that the Church needed ‘a sharp . prod’. Yesterday, David Cameron told MPs that . he hoped women would soon be joining the 26 Church of England bishops . in the House of Lords. The Archbishop of York, the Most . Reverend John Sentamu, warned against premature celebrations because the . plans must pass a final vote next year. Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said: ‘We can be cautiously hopeful of good progress.’ The . Bishop of Rochester, the Rt Rev . James Langstaff, said the result was not a cause for complacency and . reminded members the battle to push through the legislation was not . over. 'There . is a lot of work still to be done. People will have voted in favour of . this to continue the process who may or may not vote in favour of the . package at the end of the day', he said. 'So it is not over and that is a reality.' Support: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, speaks to a female member of the church . Vote: Welby (right) and Dr John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York, prepare to listen to the speeches during the General Synod . David Cameron also said he would fast track . women Bishops into the Lords to give them a presence in . parliament 'as soon as possible'. Responding to a question in the Commons today, the Prime Minister said: 'I strongly support women bishops and I hope the Church of England takes this key step to ensure its place as a modern church, in touch with our society.' There . is a lot of work still to be done. People will have voted in favour of . this to continue the process who may or may not vote in favour of the . package at the end of the day . Rt Rev James Langstaff, Bishop of Rochester . The vote could pave the way for final approval of women bishops by the General Synod in July next year. The move follows bitter recriminations . within the Church of England after the legislation failed by just six . votes to get approval at the General Synod a year ago. Several General Synod members spoke of the marked improvement in the atmosphere since the collapse of the legislation last year. The . Rt Rev Christopher Chessun, Bishop of Southwark, said: 'From where we . are today, compared to where we were a year ago, it is as someone said . to me the other day ""nothing short of miraculous"".' The . Rev Rod Thomas, chairman of Reform, the conservative evangelical . grouping, and a member of the steering committee which drew up the . proposals, paid tribute to the 'generosity of spirit' which had led to . the package. Overwhelming: Members of the General Synod overwhelmingly endorsed women bishops with 378 voting in favour and eight against with 25 abstentions . But he said there were still problems over the proposals, including the issue of authority of women bishops where parishes seek alternative arrangements. 'I am very conscious indeed of last November when people like me voted against the draft measure, it was a cause of shock, bewilderment and anger and much grief,' he said. 'Therefore to be able to sit down and talk with people who have experienced those emotions and talk constructively about ways by which we might find agreement has been a very uplifting process.' Pledge: David Cameron said he would give women bishops a presence in parliament 'as soon as possible' Prebendary David Houlding, a leading Anglo-Catholic Synod member, from London, declared that the 'battle is surely over'. 'What we have in front of us works, and it works for all of us, no matter where we are coming from on this matter,' he said. Christina Rees, a vocal supporter of women bishops, spoke of her amazement at the change of atmosphere in the General Synod. 'If anyone had told me that, one year on from last November, we would be where we are, I would have said ‘That is impossible’ but by the grace of God it has been possible.' But director of Reform Susie Leafe, a member of the steering committee who voted to abstain on commending the package, said she could not vote in favour of the motion. 'We claim that this package is designed to enable all to flourish yet I and my church can only flourish when we deny our theological convictions and accept a woman as our chief pastor.'","378 members of General Synod voted in favour of the proposals .

A Florida doctor stands to lose his license over accusations that he whipped, choked and blindfolded a naked female patient battling depression, calling it ‘punishment therapy’. The Lake Worth osteopath, Dr David Simon, who is married, has admitted to having a relationship with his 38-year-old patient after-hours in his office, according to his lawyer. A settlement has been reached between the doctor and the patient, but on Friday the Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine said the allegations against him were so serious that it was going to seek a full administrative hearing. Serious allegations: Osteopath, Dr David Simon, who has admitted to having a sexual relationship with his 38-year-old patient, stands to lose his license over the incident . Punishment therapy: The doctor is facing accusations of whipping, choking and blindfolding the female patient while she was naked calling it 'punishment therapy' to help deal with her depression . ‘He's deeply embarrassed,’ said Simon's attorney, David Spicer, according to the Sun Sentinel. ‘This was a consensual relationship with an adult woman. ‘However, the Board of Health is clear that doctors can't have a sexual relationship with a patient. That's why we worked out the settlement.’ Spicer said that settlement included two years of probation and a $10,000 fine, but the board said the charges were too serious to settle. He told the board that he would prove that the patient exaggerated, according to Health News Florida. 'You'll find out this is a fantasy. She's spinning all these tales. It wasn't torture. It was adventurous sex between two adults.' Simon denied that he tortured the patient, identified only by her initials, CK. But he conceded that what he did was 'inappropriate', that it 'crossed a boundary'. The case ruined his reputation and career, he said. 'I can't excuse it. ... I'm embarrassed for myself, and it has devastated my wife.' 'Deeply embarrassed': Simon's attorney says the doctor, pictured left a few years ago with a colleague, had a consensual relationship with the adult woman . The patient told detectives that Simon . would blindfold her and have her take off all of her clothing, and would . use whips and handcuffs on her for hours to help with her on-going . depression, according to WPBF.com. The woman told detectives Simon had her come in monthly for a year to receive the therapy which included whippings, sexual acts, being locked in a closet and tied up for hours. She said it all occurred after hours and it happened with her consent. She also said she performed sexual acts on Simon as a ‘thank you’ for the therapy. Detectives said they discovered whips, blindfolds, handcuffs, rope, clothespins and ‘phallic objects’ in Simon's office, and a rope and a blindfold in his pocket. 'Not true': Loretta Sharpe, 75, who has been a patient of Simon's for 27 years, says she does not 'believe any of it' An investigative report says the . whipping and torture of the then 37-year-old woman began in late 2010, . after she had been Simon’s patient for many years. CK . told investigators she wanted to stop the sessions but was afraid Simon . would hurt her if she did. She also needed the medication samples he . gave her, she said. Loretta Sharpe, 75, a patient of Simon's for nearly 30 years, says she doesn't believe the accusations. 'I've . gone to Dr Simon for 27 years, and when I was 27 years younger, I was a . knock-out. I don’t believe any of it,' she told WPBF.com. Sex toys: Detectives said they discovered whips, blindfolds, handcuffs, rope, clothespins and 'phallic objects' in Simon's office in Lake Worth, Florida . This is not the first time Simon has been accused of sexual harassment. A Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office report shows a second patient, 24, also reported ‘sexual harassment’ from Simon in 2010, according to WPBF.com. She told detectives that after a gynecological exam, Simon rubbed her back and the top of her buttocks and said ‘I think you need to be punished for being a bad girl. It seems you really need to be punished’. No criminal charges have been filed yet. Simon, who has 29 years of experience as a doctor, attended medical school at Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and graduated in 1984. Doctors of Osteopathy - called D.O.s - are akin to medical doctors, but osteopaths place more emphasis on 'holistic' medicine, integrating hands-on manipulation in addition to conventional testing and treatment.","Lake Worth osteopath, Dr David Simon, has admitted to having the relationship with his 38-year-old patient over a one-year period .

Health officials have destroyed $250,000 worth of a diet pill after a Hawaii man fell into a coma and needed a liver transplant to survive. Kenneth Waikiki, 22, from Kailua-Kona, who was active but wanted to lose a few pounds, started taking OxyElite Pro this past summer. A month later, he almost lost his life. ‘At first, we thought it was food poisoning,’ says Waikiki to Hawaii News Now. Almost died: Kenneth Waikiki, 22, from Kailua-Kona, fell into a coma with liver failure after taking the diet supplement, OxyElite Pro, for one month . Deadly sick: Waikiki's eyes and skin turned yellow . Then his eyes and skin turned yellow. Waikiki was flown to a Honolulu hospital but his condition got worse and soon was in a coma. ‘He didn't wake up,’ says his mother, Judy, as she remembers the long nights at the hospital. She didn't want to leave her son's side, worried that he might die. ‘I was there when he first came [into the world] if he had to leave, I had to be there,’ she says. His liver had failed and his only way to survive was if he got a liver transplant. 'He didn't wake up': Waikiki's mother, Judy, was worried her son might die when he was lying in a coma after taking the pills . On September 30, in the middle of the night, the call came that a liver was on the way from California. On October 1, Waikiki had the transplant. He is now at his home in Kailua-Kona and has to take a cocktail of medications several times a day. His mother says it is ‘a miracle’ that her son survived. The family is now suing the manufacturer, USPlabs LLC and GNC Holdings, Inc., according to Hawaii News Now. Waikiki will not be able to drink alcohol again, but jokes that his friends will always have a designated driver now. 'Miracle': His mother says she is overwhelmed that her son is still alive, thanks to the liver transplant . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state investigators, who opened an inquiry into the incident, have found the supplement to contain Ageline, a synthetic version . of a natural extract from the Bael tree, according to the Hawaii . Reporter. Aegeline has not been proven to be safe and has not been approved by the FDA for inclusion in dietary supplements. The OxyElite Pro product was sold at GNC retail locations in Hawaii. The manufacturer and retailer who sold OxyElite Pro was ordered to recall all of its products, none of which are being sold anymore. The Hawaii Department of Health . destroyed $250,000 worth of the product on Tuesday – the bottles were . seized from stores and burned. Waikiki’s mother said she is thankful her son is still alive and that the product is no longer being sold. ‘I don't wish this on anyone,’ she told Hawaii News Now. Dangerous: The FDA found that OxyElite Pro contained Aegeline, a synthetic version of a natural extract from the Bael tree, which has not been approved as safe to consume . On Tuesday a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii against the manufacturer, according to the Reporter. They claim the synthetic dietary supplement was the source of an outbreak of acute liver failure and hepatitis among residents of Hawaii. The plaintiff, Everine Van Houten, a Hawaii County resident, says in the lawsuit that she purchased two containers of OxyElite Pro from a GNC store in March. Van Houten consumed both the regular OxyElite Pro tablets and a 'new' formulation of OxyElite Pro over the next several months. She . was treated for symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue and muscle . aches on numerous occasions at Hilo Medical Center during that time . frame. Liver illness: Everine Van Houten, a Hawaii County resident, is suing the manufacturer for causing 'very severe' liver injuries after she had taken the supplement . Van Houten alleges that she underwent multiple tests and medical procedures to determine the nature and extent of her liver illness. Then she saw a public health notice in September advising of a possible link between cases of acute hepatitis and OxyElite Pro products. Her attorney, Bruce Clark, said the liver injuries associated with the product were ‘very severe’. ‘One would expect that companies selling a ‘wellness’ product would be scrupulous in ensuring the product is safe for consumers. That certainly does not appear to be the case with OxyElite Pro.’","Kenneth Waikiki, 22, from Kailua-Kona, took OxyElite Pro for one month before falling deadly ill .

Shot dead: 18-year-old Dane Scott Jr. was shot a few weeks after the death of Trayvon Martin, the black teen who was unarmed when he was shot in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer . The friend of a teenager who was fatally shot in the back by an Oklahoma police captain testified on Wednesday that the unarmed 18-year-old was not only running away when the officer fired four shots at him, but had also put his hands in the air as if to surrender. John Lockett, 17, took the stand for the second day on Wednesday in the trial of Del City, Oklahoma police Captain Randy Harrison, who is charged with first-degree manslaughter in the March 14, 2012 death of Dane Scott Jr. Lockett said he was a passenger in a car driven by Scott when Harrison pulled up behind them in a police car with lights flashing. Lockett said Scott led Harrison on a high-speed chase and tried to hide the marijuana and gun he had in the car. Scott, who had recently been released from a juvenile detention center for selling drugs, 'just started to panic,' Lockett said. Lockett said he and a second passenger pleaded with Scott to let them out during the chase that he said reached speeds of up to 100 mph. The car eventually crashed into a tractor-trailer. Lockett said Scott and Harrison scuffled on the ground after the collision before Scott wriggled free. As soon as Scott started running away, Harrison started shooting at him, Lockett said. Authorities say Scott fired four shots, with the fourth one fatally striking Lockett in the back. Scroll Down for Video . Del City police Capt. Randy Harrison looks at the jurors box in the courtroom during his trial at the Oklahoma County Courthouse in Oklahoma City, Monday, Nov. 18, 2013. Harrison faces a first-degree manslaughter charge . Lockett said a second officer had hit Scott with an electrical stun gun about the same time the final shots were fired. Scott fell to the ground and Lockett said he didn't' realize Scott had been shot until later. 'I had no idea he was gone until after the fact,' he said. According to a police affidavit, Scott was unarmed and posed no threat of death or great bodily harm at the time of the shooting. But defense attorney Doug Friesen said Harrison's use of deadly force was justified by Scott's actions before he was shot. The police affidavit says Harrison managed to get a handgun from Scott as the two wrestled before Scott ran off. Scene of the scuffle: A police affidavit says Harrison was trying to arrest Scott after a car chase and took a handgun from the teen. As Scott ran away, Harrison fired four times, with the fourth shot striking Scott in the back . John Lockett, 17 (left) the friend of Dane Scott Jr. (right) who was fatally shot by an Oklahoma police captain testified Tuesday that the unarmed 18-year-old was running away when the officer began firing at him . 'Dane Scott is dead as the result of the choices that Dane Scott made,' Friesen said during opening statements. '(Harrison) could not have done anything other than what he did do and not violate his oath.' Harrison, a 23-year veteran of the Del City Police Department, has pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter charge. He faces a minimum of four years and a maximum of life in prison if convicted. Harrison had previously arrested Scott on drug violations, and District Attorney David Prater told jurors that Harrison remained focused on Scott after he was released from juvenile detention and turned 18, meaning Scott could be charged as an adult. 'It was something other than professional. It became personal,' Prater said. 'Randy Harrison seemed obsessed with Dane Scott Jr. A police officer crossed the line.' After Harrison was charged last year, his attorney said prosecutors' decision was made in part to prevent the kind of racial discord that erupted after high-profile shootings in Florida and Tulsa. Scott was black; Harrison is white. A police affidavit says Scott was unarmed and posed no threat of death or great bodily harm. Harrison faces a minimum of four years and a maximum of life in prison if convicted of manslaughter . Scott was shot a few weeks after the death of Trayvon Martin, the black teen who was unarmed when he was shot in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer. And Harrison was charged within weeks of the arrests of two white men accused of fatally shooting three black people in Tulsa during a shooting spree that investigators described as racially motivated. According to police, Scott had previous convictions in juvenile court on misdemeanor drug charges and a pending felony case of drug possession with intent to distribute. Harrison had arrested Scott as he allegedly sold drugs near Del City High School in 2011. Court papers indicate Harrison also saw Scott allegedly selling marijuana from his home. Scott allegedly was selling drugs to a passenger in his car before the pursuit that led to the shooting, according to court records.","A witness to the shooting of unarmed Dane Scott, 18, in March last year says Scott put his hands in the air before a police officer shot him four times .

Five foreigners, including two Britons, have been charged with plotting to smuggle 100 kilograms of methamphetamine worth about $3.7million from North Korea into the U.S. The men were arrested in Thailand in September and brought to New York on Tuesday night. They were to appear in federal court in New York City on Wednesday. Britons Scott Stammers and Philip Shackels were arrested along with three men from China, Thailand and the Phillipines. Worldwide meth: The DEA made five arrests in Thailand of foreigners (one is pictured) suspected of plotting to smuggle 100 kilos of super potent meth into the U.S . They face between 10 years and a life sentence if found guilty of the charges. 'Methamphetamine is a dangerous, . potentially deadly drug, whatever its origin. 'If it ends up in our . neighborhoods, the threat it poses to public health is grave whether it . is produced in New York, elsewhere in the U.S., or in North Korea,' U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. 'This investigation shows our determination to close a potential floodgate of supply,' he continued. According . to court papers, the suppliers sold more than 30 kilograms of North . Korean meth in 2012 that was seized by authorities in Thailand and in . the Philippines. The meth tested more than 99 per cent pure, the papers . said. In . 2013, the suppliers agreed to provide 100 kilograms to confidential . sources working with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the papers . said. Defendant Le Tiong Tan Lim, from China, allegedly bragged that the organization was the only . one able to get meth from North Korea after pressure by the U.S. prompted a government crackdown on production there. The same defendant boasted that the North Korean product was 99 per cent pure methamphetamine, or Breaking Bad level potency. Terrifyingly pure: The DEA tested the meth seized in the September arrests and announced Wednesday that it tested at an astounding 99 percent pure . Life imitating art: The North Korean Meth has been compared to the fictional--and extremely pure--'Blue Magic' meth from the series Breaking Bad . The North Korean government ‘already burned all the labs. Only our labs are not closed,’ the defendant said during a meeting with the fake buyers, according to court papers. ‘To show the Americans that they are not selling it anymore, they burned it.’ The United States in the past has accused North Korea of trafficking meth. The defendant claimed to have stockpiled one ton of meth because of the diplomatic tensions. After the meeting, the suppliers sent a sample to the United States that tested 98 per cent pure, the papers said. They agreed to deliver the drugs to Thailand, where they were to be stashed in a boat and smuggled into the United States. A pan-Asian problem: Authorities say the super meth pipeline runs from North Korea to China and beyond. But Southeast Asia is also seen as a major world producer of the drug. Here, Thai officer stand behind 2 million capsules of meth seized in 2012 . A fourth defendant Alexander Lnu is accused of organizing an armed group of bikers to act security for the shipment. The fifth man, Kelly Allan Reyes Peralta, from the Philippines, allegedly met undercover officials in January along with his co-defendants. The case demonstrates ‘the emergence of North Korea as a significant source of methamphetamine in the global drug trade,’ DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said in a statement. Authorities in Thailand described the men as accomplices of Joseph Hunter, a former American soldier who was arrested on the same day as the others in Thailand. He pleaded not guilty in September to charges in New York that he was a contract killer. An indictment alleged that Hunter, also known as ‘Rambo,’ recruited a group of ex-snipers to be a security team for drug traffickers. U.S. prosecutors declined to discuss the connection between Hunter and the drug defendants. Read the indictment below...","Rogue state believed to produce meth with 'Breaking Bad' level potency .

Jailed Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel could be just days away from being set free while prosecutors appeal a ruling granting him a new trial in the 1975 slaying of neighbor Martha Moxley. Skakel, the 53-year-old nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy, has spent more than 11 years in prison. A bond hearing is scheduled for Thursday in Stamford Superior Court for Skakel, who has been serving 20 years to life and was denied parole last year. Freedom awaits: A bail hearing for Michael Skakel, pictured here earlier this month, is scheduled Thursday at Stamford Superior Court where he is expected to be released while awaiting a new trial . Robert Kennedy Jr., who campaigned to . overturn Skakel's conviction, said he felt ‘pure joy’ at the prospect . that his cousin was being released. Skakel has only seen his son a . handful of times since he was sent to prison, he said. ‘Everybody in my family knows that . Michael is innocent,’ Kennedy told The Associated Press. ‘He was in jail . for over a decade for a crime he didn't commit. The only crime that he . committed was having a bad lawyer.’ Brutal: Skakel was convicted of murdering his Greenwich, Connecticut neighbor Martha Moxely (pictured) in 1975 by bludgeoning her with his mother's golf club and shoving the shattered shaft into her neck . Judge . Thomas Bishop ruled October 23 that Skakel's trial attorney, Michael . Sherman, failed to adequately represent him in 2002 when he was . convicted in Moxley's golf club bludgeoning. Skakel and Moxley were 15-year-old neighbors in wealthy Greenwich at the time of her death. Robert . Kennedy Jr said Skakel is in a tough prison and has relied on a deep . religious faith to cope with his plight. He said he's not sure where . Skakel will live, noting he had to sell his house in the Catskills to . pay legal bills. ‘I know there is a lot of people who would open their house for him to stay,’ Kennedy said. Thursday's hearing is expected to focus on the terms and conditions of his release from prison. The ruling caught Moxley's family by . surprise after a decade of unsuccessful appeals by Skakel's attorneys. Moxley's 81-year-old mother, Dorthy, is resigned to Skakel being . released. ‘If he gets out on bail, he gets out on bail,’ Mrs. Moxley said, noting Skakel has a good prison record. ‘I . just think he ought to serve his punishment. There's no doubt in my . mind that he did it. A little justice for Martha is not asking a lot.’ John Moxley, the victim's brother, said he and his mother will attend the hearing, and he expects Skakel to be released. Skakel's . attorney, Hubert Santos, has argued that Skakel should be released . immediately, saying the ruling makes him an innocent defendant awaiting . trial and that he is not a flight risk. Legal battle: Judge Thomas Bishop ruled October 23 that Skakel's trial attorney, Michael Sherman, pictured here in April, failed to adequately represent him in 2002 . Thrilled at decision: Robert F. Kennedy Jr spoke to the Today show in his cousin's defense and says he is sure he will be found innocent at the retrial . Santos also argued prosecutors are highly unlikely to win their appeal, a contention prosecutors dispute. 'He's entitled to get out as soon as . possible,' Santos said, expressing concern that an appeal of the stay . decision could take a month or two. Skakel has maintained his innocence. Skakel's . older brother Thomas was an early suspect in the case because he was . the last person seen with the victim, but Michael Skakel was charged a . quarter century after the killing. Sherman, the trial attorney, has said he did all he could to prevent Skakel's conviction. Weapon: This photo evidence used at trial shows the murder weapon, a 6 iron golf club that belonged to the late mother of Tommy and Michael Skakel . Martha Moxley was out causing . mischief on Devil's Night, the night before Halloween, in 1976. She was . ringing doorbells, spraying shaving cream, throwing eggs, and toilet . papering homes in her elite gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. The last house she happened upon was that of Michael and his brother Tommy Skakel. She left no later than 11pm, to walk the 150 yards or so to her neighboring house. But she never got there. Instead, her body was found beneath a tree in her back yard. She had been bludgeoned with a 6 iron golf club so powerfully that the shaft had shattered. Martha had been impaled in the neck with a shard from the shattered club. Her pants had been removed, along with her underwear, but there were no signs of sexual assault. Tommy . and Michael were initially suspects in the case after it was discovered . that the murder weapon had belonged to their late mother. Long . believed to have been bungled from the start, many believed police gave . the rich family special treatment in the case and ignored, or failed to . even look for, incriminating evidence. Scene: Another court evidence photo shows the rear of the Skakel home in their elite gated Greenwich, Connecticut community. Martha Moxley's home was just 150 yards away . The case was considered a tough one for prosecutors because of the age of the crime, no forensic evidence and other challenges. But Skakel was convicted after a trial that focused on testimony that he confessed or made incriminating statements over the years. A year after Skakel was found guilty, a former classmate implicated two friends in the killing. A judge later rejected an appeal, ruling the claim was not credible. In the latest ruling, Bishop said Skakel's defense should have focused more on Thomas. He also said . Sherman failed to locate a witness who backed up Skakel's alibi that he was at his cousin's house the night of the murder and failed to find a man who challenged the claim by the star witness that Skakel confessed. The Skakels cooperated with the investigation until 1976, then abruptly stopped. Years of continued speculation about Tommy, Michael, and a range of other suspects followed. Books . were published on the subject, including one by Mark Fuhrman of OJ . Simpson trial infamy, but it wasn't until 1999 that the case got any . more traction. Clues? Evidence photo from the trial show a . hallway in the Skakel home, left, and a drop of blood in their driveway, . right. In the years since the 1975 slaying, some have criticized the . police investigators of failing to search adequately for clues because . of the family's prestige . That's when a rare Connecticut one-man grand jury was called to hear evidence for a potential new trial in the case. Fifty witnesses testified. Reportedly among them were employees and residents . of the Elan School in Poland Springs, Maine, where some claim Michael . confessed to the murder while undergoing rehab there. In January 2000, an arrest warrant was issued for Michael Skakel. He soon surrendered to authorities.

Horrific: Sarah Leonard was trampled by cows as she was walking in a field with her dog in North Scarle, Lincolnshire . A 59-year-old nurse has been left in intensive care after being trampled by a herd of cows - while taking part in a treasure hunt. Sarah Leonard was walking in a field with her dog in North Scarle, Lincolnshire, when the group of animals charged, leaving her with life-threatening injuries. She suffered two broken arms, a broken collarbone, a broken jaw and several broken ribs in the terrifying stampede on Saturday afternoon. Incredibly, Sarah bravely managed to dial 999 herself but it took paramedics 30 minutes to find her as she did not know where she was. She was taken to Lincoln County Hospital where she remains in a stable condition after several operations to save her life. Yesterday her worried brother Andrew Leonard, 62, said: 'She is now very slowly on the mend.' Sarah, from Norton, Sheffield, had been 'geocaching' - an internet-based high-tech treasure hunt which uses GPS. A Lincolnshire Police spokesman said: 'We received a call from a woman saying she had been injured and was lying in a field. 'She said she had been hurt when cows stampeded and knocked her over. 'Although she didn’t know exactly where she was, within half-an-hour her car was located at North Scarle cemetery. 'And she was found in the field off Church Lane in the village soon after. 'The woman was in quite a bad way, with severe injuries including a broken jaw and other fractures.' Church Lane in North Scarle, Lincolnshire. Sarah Leonard suffered her horrific injuries in a nearby field . Sarah’s pet King Charles spaniel Megs was uninjured after she ran off when around a dozen cows charged at them at around 3.25pm. PCSO Jo Mackie and brother Andrew found the petrified dog cowering in a bush the following day. The police spokesman added: 'PCSO Mackie was just coming off duty when the incident happened on Saturday. Most members of the public are wary of bulls, but few realise that cows, particularly those protecting newly-born calves, can also be dangerous. If you find yourself in a field of suddenly wary cattle, move away as carefully and quietly as possible, and if you feel threatened by cattle then let go of your dog’s lead and let it run free rather than try to protect it and endanger yourself. The dog will outrun the cows and it will outrun you. Those without canine companions should follow similar advice: move away calmly, do not panic and make no sudden noises. Chances are the cows will leave you alone once they establish that you pose no threat. If you walk through a field of cows and there happen to be calves, think twice; if you can, go another way and avoid crossing fields. Source: British Mountaineering Council . 'And, when she came back on Sunday, she went out with the lady’s brother and - after a search - found her dog, which had run off.' It is not clear whether Sarah was on private land at the time or whether she had permission to be in the field as part of the hunt. North Scarle Parish councillor Chris Dixon, added: 'You’d have thought permission would be required from the landowner to bury something on farmland.' The Geocaching Association of Great Britain’s code of conduct simply states: 'Respect property rights and seek permission where appropriate.' Its chairman Jen Harkley said: 'News of Sarah’s accident at the weekend did reach us and we have passed on our best wishes for a speedy recovery. 'The GAGB aren’t able to discuss the accident as we don’t know the circumstances or details of her injuries. 'However, I have sent a message to one of her geocaching friends who is in contact with her family.' Pete Dudley posted Miss Leonard’s plight on the Geocaching Midlands Facebook page. He said: 'Take care out there folks. Unfortunately, I have some upsetting news. 'Sarah Leonard was caching on Saturday and she was stampeded by a herd of cows. Unfortunately this left her seriously injured and she is now in intensive care in hospital. 'She has a number of fractures, is stable and is sedated for pain control.' Injuries: The cows left the 59-year-old with two broken arms, a broken collarbone, a broken jaw and several broken ribs. File picture . Geocaching involves hiding a small waterproof box containing a logbook and a pen, recording its co-ordinates and logging its location on a website. Another 'cacher' will see the listing, enter the co-ordinates into their GPS receiver and go in search of it. It is similar to the 150-year-old game letterboxing, which uses clues and references to landmarks embedded in stories. Geocaching was invented in 2000 when GPS readings became more accurate. In total there are two million geocaches all over the world and more than five million people take part in the activity globally. Most members of the public are wary of bulls, but few realise that cows, particularly those protecting newly-born calves, can also be dangerous. Health and Safety Executive figures show that over 480 people have been injured by cows in the past eight years. Last year Sandra Wiltshire, 68, died alongside her beloved golden Labrador, Bruce, after she was trampled by cows in a field near their home in Chippenham in Wiltshire. In 2009 the deaths of four people trampled by cows within a period of two months led the National Farmers Union to issue a warning. In June, vet Liz Crowsley, 49, was walking her dogs along the Pennine Way, in West Yorkshire when she was charged by a herd and died. It is thought the animals became alarmed by her dogs, although they were on leads, because they were protecting their calves. In July, Anita Hinchey, 63, was walking with a friend in St Fagans, near Cardiff, when she fell among a herd. An inquest heard she was trying to put her dog back on its lead. That month, Barry Pilgrim, 65, was also fatally attacked in Sheldon, Derbyshire. Police again feared the cows has become 'over-protective'. A farmer died from serious head and chest injuries after he was trampled by cows, which appear to have been scared by a fire engine in August. Harold Lee, 75, was bringing up the rear of a herd of 100 dairy cows being led along a country lane, when they turned and bolted towards him.","Sarah Leonard, 59, trampled by the animals in a Lincolnshire field .

Obese U.S. pilots and air traffic controllers will soon need to be screened for sleep apnea, a condition that can cause daytime sleepiness and potentially jeopardise passenger safety, according to a new federal policy. The Federal Aviation Administration's chief medical officer told physicians in a recent memo that they will shortly be required to calculate the body mass index (BMI) of pilots and controllers and send those with a BMI of 40 or more to be evaluated by a sleep specialist. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a potentially serious disorder in which a person's breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. It commonly affects people who are overweight. Too fat to fly? Obese pilots will soon be screened for sleep apnea, a potentially life-threatening condition which causes daytime drowsiness and can lead to heart attacks and strokes (file picture of unconnected pilots) The FAA said the condition has 'significant safety implications' from excessive daytime sleepiness to personality disturbances, cognitive impairment and sudden cardiac death. 'Untreated obstructive sleep apnea is a disqualifying condition for airmen and air traffic control specialists,' Dr Fred Tilton, the Federal Air Surgeon, said in the memo to aviation medical examiners. While the condition has been frequently discussed at flying safety meetings, and has been a 'hot issue' at the National Transportation Safety Board for several years, the new policy will require airmen and controllers who are diagnosed with OSA to be treated before they can be medically certificated, Tilton said. The condition is 'almost universal' in individuals with a body mass index over 40 and a neck circumference of 17 inches or more, Tilton said, though it also affects up to 30 per cent of people with a BMI of less than 30. 'Significant safety implications': Air traffic controllers with a body mass index of 40 or more also face being taken off duty if they have the condition (file picture of unconnected air traffic controllers) A body mass index of 40 equates roughly to a 5ft 10in individual weighing 280 pounds, according to the National Institutes of Health. A BMI of 30 or greater is considered obese. Tilton said that examiners should also be on alert for other sleep-related disorders, from insomnia to restless leg syndrome. After the first round of tests, the agency will gradually expand its program to examine individuals with lower BMIs, Tilton said. The FAA has not announced a starting date for its new policy. The plan would be rolled out first to pilots and then to controllers. 'Remember,' Tilton wrote, 'you, as aviation medical examiners, are our front line, and your daily interaction with pilots and controllers has an enormous impact on the safety of the national airspace.' Sleep apnea is a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep. It occurs when the muscles and soft tissue in the throat relax and collapse sufficiently to cause a blockage in the airway, as shown in the graphic above. When this happens, the person tends to wake up momentarily while their breathing returns to normal. When they slip back into a deep sleep they often stop breathing again. Many people with sleep apnea snore and they often feel tired during the day as their sleep is interrupted. It is associated with being overweight. Other risk factors include having a large neck, taking sleeping pills, drinking alcohol and smoking. Sleep apnea affects about four per cent of middle aged men and two per cent of middle aged women in the UK. It can affect people of any age but it most common in middle aged people. Some cases can be treated through lifestyle changes - such as losing weight - but people with more severe cases may require breathing apparatus to keep their airway open. If left untreated, sleep apnea can increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart attacks, strokes and diabetes.

An engineering company boss shot himself after his wife told him she was leaving because he spent all his free time clay pigeon shooting, an inquest has heard. Denise Thackery told her husband Stephen she had decided to end her 34-year marriage to husband Stephen over his hobby and his drinking. Mr Thackery begged her to reconsider, the inquest heard, buying her gifts and cleaning the house. Inquest: Rotherham Coroner's Court heard that Denise Thackery told her husband Stephen she had decided to end her 34-year marriage to husband Stephen over his hobby and his drinking . 'He said he would cut down the drinking and shooting but he didn’t,' Mrs Thackery told the hearing in Rotherham. 'He was trying hard I suppose but I didn’t want him to change who he was. It was just too late. 'I didn’t want him to buy me gifts or clean the house, he has never done that. 'I didn’t want him to drink so much or be out all the time shooting.' The body of Mr Thackery, 57, was found in the garage at the family home in Thorpe Hesley, near Rotherham with a shotgun by his side. Just three weeks earlier armed police were called to the house when he drunkenly threatened to kill himself and he was arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear or violence. He had told his son Ashley he was 'going off to the garage to shoot myself, but later told officers it was a flippant remark and that he didn’t mean it. His guns were seized and he was kept overnight at a police station but he was released without charge after officers decided he had not threatened anybody and there was insufficient evidence that a crime had been committed. His guns were returned to him five days later. Mrs Thackery told her husband their marriage was over in January this year but she only planned to leave the family home after their Ashley’s wedding in July. Her husband was said to be 'shocked and unhappy' at the news and did not want the marriage to end. 'For 25 years he spent all his free time shooting, it was always targets or clays.' Denise Thackery . 'He told me: “I can’t live without you” but I just thought he was being ridiculous,' she said. The inquest heard that when Mr Thackery was arrested he had got drunk on whisky at home and told his wife 'it all got out of hand'. She told the hearing she had spent too many lonely nights on her own. 'Shooting was his life,' she said. 'For 25 years he spent all his free time shooting, it was always targets or clays.' He had repeatedly asked her to come back to him but she never thought he would take his own life. The inquest heard Mr Thackery typed two letters to his wife and son which were found after his death on February 22. In the letters he said his final goodbyes, expressed his regrets and talked about funeral arrangements, even which music should be played. His sister-in-law Christine Yates had found him on the fateful day in the kitchen playing Adele at full blast and he hugged her very tightly. She said: 'I told him he was drunk and he said “you have got to be for what I’m going to do today'.” The inquest heard Mr Thackery told Ms Yates 'I got it wrong, I got it all wrong' and she later heard a muffled thud outside. Police were called and they found his body in the garage. Mr Thackery’s mobile phone records were checked and in the few hours before his death he had sent a text message a shooting pal to say he had a 'broken heart'. He also sent a message to his wife saying 'goodbye the love of my life'. South Yorkshire Police’s professional standards department were called in to investigate whether he had been properly assessed when he was arrested. Detective Sergeant Jim McGuiness said an interview at the station with Detective Constable Kerry Frith was 'lacking in any depth or investigative probing', but that any assessment of Mr Thackery’s suitability to hold guns was a 'judgment call' for the firearms team leader. Mrs Thackery told the hearing: 'He couldn’t see past the fact that we were going to separate and he gave up. 'I don’t think he wanted to spoil his son’s wedding day but it call became too much.' Coroner Nicola Mundy recorded a conclusion of suicide. She said: 'He never came to terms with the idea that he would be without his wife.'","Stephen Thackery, 57, killed himself after wife told him marriage was over .

Teenage boys and girls at a secondary school are sharing the same toilets - to the outrage of parents. Moulton School, Northampton, merged two blocks last month in a bid to cut bullying in 'intimidating' single-sex toilets. But parents said the move could have the opposite effect - and teenagers with 'raging hormones' may shift their amorous liasons away from the bike sheds and onto school property. Anger: These unisex toilets were installed for pupils in Moulton School, Northampton. One parent said it would encourage 'raging hormones and teenage angst' while another criticised the lack of mirrors . Mother-of-two Jayne Poole, 39, said: 'If the kids are dating there will be no more ""round the back . of the bike sheds"" - it will be the toilets they escape to. 'At a time of raging hormones and teenage angst they need their own personal and separate space. 'I think this is a very bad idea.' Headteacher Trevor Jones is believed to have made the controversial decision with the backing of school governors. He said: 'We want to provide . excellent facilities for our students and this design is intended to . reduce both bullying and vandalism, as traditional toilet areas can be . intimidating and unpleasant areas for students to go into.' There are also other toilets in the school which have remained single-sex-only. Headteacher Trevor Jones defended the move saying other toilets were 'intimidating and unpleasant' Unisex school toilets are far from flash-in-the-pan - they were introduced six years ago. The now-defunct company which ran Labour's Building Schools for the Future programme said the mixed-sex facilities could stop bullying. Guidelines signed off by Labour's Department for Education also said urinals should be scrapped, glass-panelled walls installed between sinks and background noise increased to ensure 'aural privacy'. Hand-washing . areas would also be moved to semi-open corridors near the cubicles, where staff could see them. And each school was recommended to have an extra . self-contained lavatory with its own sink, where pupils could have more privacy. The parents' group Campaign for Real Education opposed the facilities previously, too, saying: 'It’s very important that young people are not allowed to be pressured by the opposite sex and can retain their modesty.' However, they are believed to have been installed in hundreds of schools which were built or revamped under Building Schools for the Future, which was axed in 2010. They have become so widespread that national building firms have a 'stock design' for unisex toilets. But the mixed toilet, which has two . boys' and two girls' cubicles with a shared wash basin and hand dryer, . has annoyed parents in other ways. It has no mirrors, supposedly to stop it becoming a social hub. One parent, who did not want to be named, said: 'Girls, . especially teenagers, care about their appearance, even more so when . they are at a school with boys, so to remove the mirrors is ridiculous. 'They should be allowed to keep their appearance up, even if it is a simple thing such as making sure they look presentable. 'Even for the boys, they might want to re-arrange their tie if it has gone a bit wonky.' She added: 'I have a daughter who goes to the . school and she deserves privacy when she goes to the bathroom. Teenage . girls go through changes, everyone knows that, it can be a delicate and . embarrassing moment in their lives. 'It is just a gross breach of privacy.' Former headteacher Chris McGovern, . 62, is the chairman of the volunteer parents' group the Campaign For . Real Education and worked as a teacher for 35 years. He . said he was 'extremely sceptical', adding: 'It may actually increase . bullying because it is an area that teachers will rarely go - it could . drive bullying underground, behind closed doors, in a way. 'There's no reason why it will possibly reduce any form of bullying. 'Toilets . are, and should be, private for both sexes. Mixing them could cause a . disaster and children would probably want to have separate toilets. 'Pupils are under enough pressure as it is in school. 'I do believe it will be worse for the . girls - and I wouldn't be surprised if most of the students don't want . to go to the toilet while they are in school. The changes took place last month at Moulton School in Northampton, which has more than 1,500 pupils . He added: 'It seems to be an exceptional decision, I haven't heard many like this before. It doesn't seem logical at all.' The school, graded good by Ofsted this year, has more than 1,500 pupils and was made a specialist science college in 2002. Headteacher Mr Jones said: 'The new area is being used regularly and safely, and the only adverse comment that has come from the students is regarding the absence of mirrors; a deliberate decision to avoid toilet areas becoming areas for social gathering.'","Four cubicles installed at mixed-sex Moulton School in Northampton .

A grandmother stabbed her daughter-in-law to death to stop her moving to another part of the country with her grandson, a court heard today. Heather Emmonds, played bingo with her husband just hours after she allegedly knifed Tina Casey, 42, to multiple times on her sofa at her home in Holywell, North Tyneside, in February. The 58-year-old, who had already tried to posion Miss Casey, also set fire to the clothes she had been wearing in a Roses chocolates tin after the attack and had considered setting Miss Casey’s home alight with her body still inside. But she decided against it because she was put off by a television programme, saying she had 'seen too many CSIs to know it doesn’t really work', Newcastle Crown Court heard. Emmonds also admitted in interview she had put her hand Miss Casey’s mouth to stop her screaming during the 'frenzied' attack, Newcatsle Crown Court heard. The following day the defendant was found collapsed in her Vauxhall Corsa after crashing on a roundabout having taken an overdose of sleeping pills. Police found 10 hand-written letters in her car, confessing to killing her son Keith’s partner. In one of the notes, Emmonds said: 'Please don’t hate me for what I have done. I really thought it was the best for you. I know it won’t look like it. 'But Dad is a great dad so be good for him and Gramps. I will always love you from, your loving grandmother.' In another, she wrote to police: 'I didn’t intend to kill Tina Casey, it was a moment of madness and impulse. 'The knife and my clothes are in the boot of my car. The knife was mine but I lent it to Tina Casey. There was no preconceived plan. It just happened. 'I went on to autopilot, not eating or sleeping. I have never harmed anyone in my life. I am ashamed of my actions.' Scene: Miss Casey's body was discovered with multiple stab wounds on her sofa in Holywell in Whitley Bay, Newcastle . Alistair MacDonald, prosecuting, said: 'That was a very devious and cunning attempt to explain away how one of her knives had been used to kill Tina Casey. 'It demonstrates with complete clarity that this was far from an incident that blew up at the scene of the killing but Heather Emmonds went quite deliberately armed with a knife knowing full well what she was doing.' Emmonds denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility and loss of control. The prosecution said Miss Casey, who previously lived on the Isle of Man, planned to return there with the defendant’s young grandson, so Emmonds would lose touch with him. Mr MacDonald said: 'The defendant could not face the prospect of the removal of her grandson to the Isle of Man and her inability to see him as she has been able to when he lived in the North East.” Emmonds, of Blyth Street, Seaton Delaval, Northumberland, attacked Ms Casey with a filleting knife after coming round to visit. 'Far from there being no intention to kill, that was precisely the intention,' Mr MacDonald said. After leaving Miss Casey dead, face-down on the sofa, Emmonds tried to clean blood off the carpet, washed her knife in bleach and changed into a fresh set of clothes she had brought with her, the court was told. She left after locking the doors and closing the curtains. Case: Defendant Heather Emmonds has denied killing Tina Casey at Newcastle Crown Court . 'Knowing full well that Tina was lying dead at her home, the defendant told a pack of lies,' Mr MacDonald added. Emmonds told the officer Ms Casey had told her she planned to visit an aunt in Ponteland, Northumberland. 'All this was an elaborate charade designed to put the police off the scent,' the prosecution said. In the previous week, Ms Casey had made a statement to police reporting she had been poisoned. Emmonds made her a chilli on one night and a sweet and sour dish another night, both of which tasted strange. The grandmother later confessed to police she had crushed up strong sleeping tablets in the food she had made to render Ms Casey ill, so she would come to rely on her. 'They had failed,' Mr MacDonald said. 'The knife attack did not.' Mr MacDonald said Ms Casey once considered her a 'rock' for the help she offered, but the two had since fallen out. Emmonds told police she took the same tablets she used to poison Ms Casey before she crashed her car. Mr MacDonald said: 'It is an example of someone thinking things through perfectly logically.' The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Heather Emmonds knifed Tina Casey, 42, in Holywell, North Tyneside .

As conditions of the bail, the judge ordered that Skakel live in Connecticut and wear a GPS tracking device. 'He's one of the most recognized faces of America, so he's not going anywhere,' defense attorney Hubert Santos said, noting that Skakel always showed up for court appearances. Santos said after the hearing ended that Skakel was 'very happy' about the outcome. A judge ruled last month that Skakel's trial attorney, Michael Sherman, failed to adequately represent Skakel in 2002 when he was convicted in Moxley's bludgeoning with a golf club in wealthy Greenwich when they were both 15.

Outside . court, Moxley's brother John and mother, Dorthy, said they disagreed . with the bail decision, continue to believe Skakel killed Martha and are . confident he will be convicted again at a new trial. 'I'm . disappointed. ...I guess we knew that the day would come,' Dorthy . Moxley said. 'I wasn't completely destroyed, but I wish it didn't . happen.' Added John Moxley, 'We have nothing to say to Michael.'

'Everybody in my family knows that Michael is innocent,' Kennedy said on Tuesday. 'He was in jail for over a decade for a crime he didn't commit. The only crime that he committed was having a bad lawyer.' Santos, had argued that Skakel should be released immediately, saying that the ruling makes him an innocent defendant awaiting trial and that he was not a flight risk. Santos also argued prosecutors were highly unlikely to win their appeal, a contention prosecutors dispute. The case was considered a big challenge for prosecutors because of issues including the age of the crime and the lack of forensic evidence. Michael Skakel was convicted after a trial that focused on testimony that he confessed or made incriminating statements over the years. Both Sherman and prosecutors defended his handling of the case. Skakel's older brother Thomas was an early suspect in the case because he was the last person seen with the victim, and Bishop said in his ruling that Michael Skakel's defense should have focused more on Thomas.

Jamie Kightley died in hospital of respiratory failure and a heart attack after suffering severe brain damage . Jobless Kightley, 24, and 21-year-old Parker were found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a child following a three-week trial at Nottingham Crown Court. They were originally accused of murder, but the charge was dropped mid-way through the trial after jurors were told how the couple had 'hidden behind a wall of silence' - making it impossible to say exactly who had harmed Jamie. The youngster was taken by ambulance to Northampton General Hospital at around 6.30am on March 17 last year. The court heard he had extensive bruising all over his body, was not breathing, and no pulse. He was pronounced dead about 30 minutes after arrival. Prosecutors said Jamie had been assaulted at his home in Northampton within hours of his death - and around two weeks earlier. Jobless Kightley, 24, and 21-year-old Parker were found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a child following a three-week trial at Nottingham Crown Court . But his parents both denied doing anything to harm their son when they gave evidence. The hearing was told the callous pair “concocted” a “malicious” story in which they claimed to have previously shown bruising to a local GP, who dismissed it as unimportant. Kightley, who admitted drinking lager and smoking cannabis the day before Jamie’s death, accepted only he or Parker could have caused the fatal injuries. However, both he and his partner insisted they had no idea how Jamie received them, and dialled 999 after waking up to find him ill. Prosecutor Sally Howes QC said it was part of the Crown’s case that the couple, of Northampton, had agreed to remain silent in a bid to be found not guilty. However, after they were convicted, Judge Mr Justice Baker said he was satisfied both Kightley and Parker shared a ‘substantial level of culpability’ in Jamie’s death. Image shows X-box and controllers plugged into the TV beside the baby gym mat in the living room as it was found by police inside the former home shared by Adam Kightley and Jacqueline Parker . He added: 'You were his parents with whom he lived and were responsible for his care and welfare. 'During his short life Jamie was subjected on at least two and probably three occasions to deliberate traumatic harm: the latter two episodes involving the gripping and shaking of him with sufficient violence to cause him to suffer bleeding to the areas of his eyes and brain, and the fracturing of his ribs and the bones of his legs. 'As a result of the final episode of violence, Jamie also suffered brain damage leading to his death.'It is clear from the medical evidence in this case that the episodes of violence would not only have caused pain and upset to Jamie, but more significantly would have caused visible bruising to his body, which should at the very least have caused you to seek prompt medical attention. 'Instead, not only did each of you fail to do so in the days leading up to his death, but I am quite satisfied that in order to cover up for this failure you concocted a story in which you maliciously suggested that you had previously shown bruising to a local GP who had dismissed it as unimportant. 'Your individual failure to take even the most basic action led to the perpetrator being able to strike again, this time with fatal results. In this manner your culpability led directly to the death of your son.' Mr Justice Baker said that as a 'result of the stance both of you took' during police interviews and the trial, 'the identity of the perpetrator may never be known'. Kightley was jailed for seven years, with Parker, who wept as she was sentenced, receiving the same term in a young offenders’ institution. After the case Detective Sergeant Paul Hamilton, of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, said: “We accept the sentences. 'My heart goes out to the jury who listened to and saw the medical evidence, and to the police officers involved as well.

The Government’s controversial £50billion high speed HS2 project cleared its latest hurdle as legislation to kick-start its building from London to the North was given the green light. MPs were told that the High Speed Rail (Preparation) Act 2013 – a so-called ‘paving Bill’ which paves the way for construction - has been formally agreed by the Queen. It came as Prime Minister David Cameron . hosted a reception for civic leaders who support the line which is . blighting the homes of thousands of residents in its path, declaring it: . ‘great for the whole country’. Support: Prime Minister David Cameron receives a declaration of support for HS2 from representatives from the UK's ten largest cities outside of London on the day the Queen formally agreed the bill that will make HS2 a reality . Link: The project, estimated to cost around £50 billion, is intended to link London to Birmingham by 2026, with two branches then heading to Manchester and Leeds, via Sheffield, being built by 2033 . The royal assent for the legislation allows the Government to spend money planning the HS2 route in detail and buying up property from residents and businesses along the proposed track. A more detailed hybrid Bill for its construction will be published early next week. The latest development coincided with a dozen council chiefs meeting Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street to pledge their backing for the £50billion high-speed project. The leaders posed outside Number 10 with Mr Cameron holding a long banner bearing the words High Speed Rail for High Speed Cities. Mr Cameron said: ‘Everyone benefits from HS2. It's great for the whole country.’ After the meeting in Downing Street, which was also attended by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Manchester City Council leader Sir Richard Leese said: ‘HS2 will benefit London but will benefit regional cities even more, so it's a win-win situation.' Next step: The leaders posed outside Number 10 with Mr Cameron holding a long banner bearing the words High Speed Rail for High Speed Cities . The second phase of HS2 is scheduled to take the line north of Birmingham to north west and north east England by 2032/33. Sir Richard, who is 62, said: ‘We need high-speed rail to the north sooner and running further. My ambition is to able to ride on the high-speed line from Manchester in my lifetime.’ Birmingham City Council leader Sir Albert Bore said: ‘Mr Cameron supports our view this is all about increasing capacity and bringing economic gain to the country as a whole.’ Leeds City Council member James Lewis added: '2032/33 is a long time to wait and we would like to see work on phase two starting as soon as possible. ‘We are not planning to build any more motorways so the only way the country is going to thrive is through HS2.’ In the Commons former Wales secretary Cheryl Gillan, who has campaigned against HS2, was next to speak in the Commons during a debate on stalking following the announcement from Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing. To laughter as MPs recognised the situation, Ms Gillan said: ‘I could have done without the announcement of the royal assent to the Bill, which I think colleagues know causes a great deal of difficulty for constituents in Chesham and Amersham.' The project, estimated to cost around £50 billion, is intended to link London to Birmingham by 2026, with two branches then heading to Manchester and Leeds, via Sheffield, being built by 2033. HS2 Ltd chief executive Alison Munro said: ‘The passage of the Paving Bill is a critical milestone in the delivery of the programme, ahead of the deposit of the Hybrid Bill next week. ‘We can now continue to take forward the early activities for delivery of HS2, such as early ground investigation works. 'We will also be able to start working with the private sector on developing skills and training in preparation for the delivery of HS2.’ Extension: The second phase of HS2 is scheduled to take the line north of Birmingham to north west and north east England by 2032/33 .","So-called 'paving BIll' clearing way for construction given Royal approval .

Neighbours who had ran from their houses opposite poured buckets of water over the fire but this had no effect. Mr Coombes said the mystery motorist who prevented serious damage to the mosque has never been identified or traced by the police. Judge Jamie Tabor QC said it was a great shame he had not been found to be thanked and rewarded for his public spirited actions. Neighbours ran from their houses and poured buckets of water over the fire but this had no effect . A passer by puts out the fire with his car extinguisher which was started by Ashley Juggins at a mosque in Gloucester in revenge for the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby . The fire caused £3,200 damage to the mosque. Jailing the men the judge told them 'Lee Rigby was killed 27 days prior to this offence and although it has not been openly declared by either of your advocates as a reason for this attack I do not regard it as a co-incidence that it should follow so soon after his death. 'Ninety-nine per cent of the population of this country, irrespective of their colour or creed, will have been horrified by the circumstances surrounding that tragic killing. 'After his death there were a series of arson attacks on mosques across the country - Grimsby, Harlow, Haywards Heath, Luton. Those attacks were termed hate crimes and I have no doubt this offence was driven by hate.' 'Such extremist views when they lead to activity of this kind destabilise the community, breed distress and very often destroy bridge building. This is precisely what extremists want' Judge Jamie Tabor QC . Addressing Ceronne, the judge said 'I have no doubt that you have an enduring hatred for followers of Islam and you are quite unwilling or unable to differentiate between the tiny minority who have extremist views and the vast majority of law abiding citizens who, for instance, worship at the Gloucester mosque. 'In short, your views are or were equally extreme as the various persons you sought revenge against. 'Such extremist views when they lead to activity of this kind destabilise the community, breed distress and very often destroy bridge building. This is precisely what extremists want. 'In short, you played into their hands to provide propaganda to be used against the population at large.' After Ceronne’s arrest soon after the fire his employers, P&L Security, told police he had ‘expressed anti-Muslim views’ to them. In September 2009 Ceronne had a police caution for racially aggravated behaviour, Mr Coombes said. Police carried out internet research on Ceronne and found his email address in the list of members of the British Union of Fascists dated Feburary 22 this year, the barrister added. 'Ceronne’s entry on the website said he had been involved in ‘a few far Right cults including the English Defence League,’ said Mr Coombes. 'He believes in freedom of speech although the defence recognises that this went way, way beyond what is acceptable' Joe Maloney, defence . A January 19 website entry by the New British Union described Ceronne as the district officer for Gloucestershire. Police also found internet chat page dated September 2011 where Ceronne used racist anti-muslim terms. Pieces of paper about the EDL were found in a bedroom at Ceronne’s home. One of them contained ‘a diatribe against Sharia Law.’ Another said ‘EDL Forever, No Surrender’ and was signed Clive. There was also a printout referring to ‘EDL Angels who oppose Islamic extremists’ with information about an EDL rally in Bradford. Ceronne, from Gloucester, and Juggins from Cheltenham, both pleaded guilty to arson being reckless whether life was endangered on June 18. Joe Maloney, for Ceronne, said: 'He recognises that what he was involved in was totally unacceptable. He does not seek to suggest he can in any way justify what happened.' Both men had been drinking that night and alcohol fuelled their actions, he said. 'He believes in freedom of speech although the defence recognises that this went way, way beyond what is acceptable. 'Since he has been in custody he has had cause to reflect on some of his beliefs. That is not to say he has dramatically changed overnight. It would be foolish to suggest otherwise.' For Juggins, Dermot Clarke said he had not wanted to cause real damage or danger and had spread the petrol around the doorstep rather than on the door. Juggins had been recruited to the EDL by Ceronne at the library in Hesters Way, Cheltenham, when Ceronne worked as a security guard there, he said. But Juggins had quit his EDL membership after a couple of years because he felt it was ‘nothing more than throwing things at the police.’","Clive Ceronne is a self proclaimed fascist who belonged to EDL .

After travelling through space it formed part of a meteorite shower that landed in the Moroccan desert last year. A small lump of the planet Mars that fell to Earth in a meteorite shower is set to sell for the astronomical sum of £160,000. The meteorite was named after the village of Tissint, where it came down. Experts said the shower was the most important to have occurred on Earth in 100 years. It was acquired by an American company that collects meteorites and earlier this year sold the bulk of it, a chunk weighing 2.5lbs, to the Natural History Museum in London. It retained this smaller fragment which has now been made available for sale at auction. The lump is an igneous rock formed from solidifed lava and has a glossy black fusion crust on the outside. Jim Walker, of the US-based Heritage Auctions, said: 'This piece is part of the same meteorite that formed the largest piece from the shower to fall to Earth.

'Whether it broke up on impact or separated earlier I don’t know but it does fit into the much bigger piece, like a 3D jigsaw.

She appeared in some of the Victorian period's most famous paintings and married one of Britain's greatest artists before dying of a laudanum overdose at the age of 32. Now the fascinating life of Lizzie Siddal, dubbed the Pre-Raphaelite supermodel, is to be brought to the stage for the first time. The play, named Lizzie Siddal, tells the story of the flame-haired beauty from the day she was plucked from the obscurity of a Victorian bonnet shop to her tragic death. Muse: The most famous painting to feature Siddal is John Everett Millais 1862 masterpiece, Ophelia . Starring role: Emma West plays Lizzie Siddal while Tom Bateman portrays her artist husband Rossetti . Premiering at the Arcola Theatre on the 20th November, the play stars Emma West as the tragic model and Tom Bateman, currently appearing on Sky Atlantic's The Tunnel, as her husband Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Rossetti was one of the most famous of the Pre-Raphaelites and is cited as an inspiration for William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones among others. Among his works are The Roman Widow and Beata Beatrix, both of which starred Siddal, and Lady Lillith which depicts another of his harem of flame-haired muses and lovers, Fanny Cornforth. But it was Siddal who would prove his greatest love and the painter was left heartbroken by her death in 1862. 'The more you read about her the more fascinating she becomes,' playwright Jeremy Green revealed in an interview with the BBC. Portrait of a supermodel: An 1854 self portrait (left) and Rossetti's 1860 work Regina Cordium (right) 'Here's a woman who, with no advantages, became famous as a model; but that wasn't sufficient, she wanted to produce art and, falling in love, she wanted to be fulfilled in her love - and in pursuit of both she met tragic consequences. 'It's a play about love and death and immortality.' Siddal's career began when she was spotted working in a London milliners shop by early Pre-Raphaelite artist, Walter Deverell. Through Deverell, Siddal, described as 'a most beautiful creature with an air between dignity and sweetness' by her future brother-in-law William Michael Rossetti, met the remaining Pre-Raphaelite artists, including Rossetti himself. Of all the paintings inspired by Siddal though, the most famous is Sir John Everett-Millais' 1852 work Ophelia, which shows the model as Shakespeare's doomed Danish princess floating in a river before her death from drowning. To produce the painting, Siddal was required to lie in an icy-cold bath for hours on end, a requirement that led to a bout of pneumonia. Beauty: Siddal portrayed in Rossetti's 1863 Beata Beatrix (left) and in a rare period photograph (right) Resemblance: Emma West plays Siddal in the new play and experienced being submerged in a bath . 'I had the experience of lying in the bath,' West told the BBC. 'The longest I did was five or six hours,. 'That's a helpful thing to have done, despite the fact that my fingers were prune-like. The crew were scooping cold water out and pouring in hot water so I was fine.' She adds: 'It's tempting to think, ""How cruel of Millais"", but actually there was nothing to stop Lizzie saying, 'It's getting a bit cold now'. But she didn't. She chose to try and be the perfect model for him.' Although Ophelia is the most famous of the paintings featuring Siddal, by 1851, she was also sitting for Rossetti, whose paintings of her are thought to number in the thousands, and who continued to paint her even after her death. Siddal never entirely recovered from the ill-health caused by sitting for Ophelia, and despite years spent recuperating in Nice, remained frail. Later, she succumbed to depression, caused in part, by Rossetti's numerous affairs, and also developed an addiction to laudanum. When, in 1861, she suffered a stillbirth, the end was in sight. On the 11th February 1862, Rossetti came home to find her dying in her bed. Siddal, the first supermodel, had taken an overdose of the drug, although whether it was deliberate or not remains a mystery. She was just 32 years old.

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 17:53 EST, 13 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:16 EST, 14 November 2013 . For years they said Elmbridge was the closest place to paradise in the UK. That exclusive corner of Surrey – dubbed ‘the Beverly Hills of Britain’ – offered everything from long life expectancy to low crime rates. Residents even enjoyed more sunshine. But it seems there is now somewhere even brighter – and it’s sitting midway between the built up cities of Birmingham and Coventry. Sitting between Birmingham and Coventry, Solihull has been named as the best place to live in the UK . Unlikely as it may seem to many in the South East, Solihull – the home to Land Rover’s main production plant – is now ‘officially the best place to live’. With a population of just over 200,000 residents, known as ‘Silhillians’, the town is commonly thought to be named after the position of the church of St Alphege – on a ‘soily hill’. It may not sound as glamorous as the Elmbridge towns of Claygate and Oxshott, but the bottom line is Silhillians enjoy everything from better pay to faster broadband than millions of other Brits. Among its local heroes are Good Life actress Felicity Kendal, who was born in Olton, a suburb of the borough. BBC newsreader Michael Buerk, former England rugby captain Martin Johnson and Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond were also all born in Solihull. And Apprentice star and newly-appointed Government small business champion Karren Brady lives with her family in the nearby village of Knowle. Local: Good Life actress Felicity Kendal is one of Solihull's most famous residents . A standards of living report by price comparison website Uswitch.com examined every aspect of life in different parts of Britain – from the amount of sunshine to life expectancy, average earnings and crime rates. While Scotland dominated the bottom of the league table, Solihull – where many people commute the ten miles to Birmingham city centre – came out on top. The Uswitch report said: ‘People in Solihull pay high house prices, high energy bills and hefty council tax bills. ‘But these costs are outstripped by high average salaries, relatively high levels of disposable income, low mortality rates, high life expectancy and above average broadband speeds.' The average Silhillian household has a disposable income of £17,359 per head. By comparison, those of both East and North Ayrshire, ranked the ‘worst’ places to live, have a disposable income of £14,430 a year. The average weekly rent paid by a Silhillian is only £69, while a six-bedroom home can be bought for the price of a small flat in many parts of the South East. Life expectancy in the town is calculated as 81 for men and 84 for women. The annual car insurance paid by residents is £528 a year, which is cheaper than anywhere else. In 1840, a description of Solihull by the anonymous author of Sketch of Solihull said: ‘[Solihull] is remarkably neat and rural in its appearance and justly excites the admiration of travellers. ‘Though the houses of the poor are inter-mingled with those of their richer neighbours, yet no painful disparity offends the eye or impels the beholder to invidious comparisons. ‘An air of comfort and respectability marks all alike and renders Solihull indisputably a delightful looking town.’ Solihull was the birthplace of BBC newsreader Michael Buerk, former England rugby captain Martin Johnson and Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond . Solihull is one of the most prosperous towns in the Midlands. Almost 70 per cent of the borough is designated as green belt and it enjoys superior communication links with the M40, M42 and M6 all close by. The town was the subject of The Country Diary of an Edwardian Lady by Edith Holden, an artist and naturalist who lived in Olton. Written in 1906, it was forgotten until it became an international bestseller when published in 1977, 57 years after her death. While the Uswitch report showed that residents of West London are the richest in the country, typically getting a post-tax income of £32,823 each, it is also the most dangerous place with the highest crime rate. Michael Ossei, a personal finance expert at Uswitch.com, said: ‘This is hard evidence of  the different challenges faced  by people depending on where they live.’","Elmbridge, Surrey, has long been considered 'the Beverley Hills of Britain'

Fraudsters who could have made up to £4 million from job seekers after posting fake adverts for work at Harrods online were jailed today. The gang, described as ‘manipulative, arrogant and devious’, wrote ‘Trojan’ malware and hid it in job application packs to download from free website Gumtree. Once embedded on to applicants’ computers, the illicit software copied bank log-in and security details and sent them to the gang. A gang of fraudsters have been jailed after posting fake job adverts for Harrods on free website Gumtree . They would then empty the victims’ accounts, earning between £400 and £4,700 each time. The fraudsters would then send 'mules' to withdraw the money from banks or would themselves go on online shopping sprees. It was described as a ‘deliberate, organised, planned and sophisticated crime’. One of the gang members, Olalekan Awosile, 27, set up an account in Costa Rica to launder their ill-gotten gains. Within just a 21-day period detectives found BlackBerry messages indicating the gang were making on average £16,000 a day. Calculated over the whole length of the nine-month fraud, they could have netted as much as £4 million, the Old Bailey heard. Walton Hornsby, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey it was difficult to estimate but said they had pocketed at least £1 million. The jury at the Old Bailey were told the gang, based in South London, could have made up to £4 million . The fraud was uncovered when . job seekers complained to Harrods that their computers had become . infected when they downloaded the application form. The . store’s director of security Gregory Faulkener then responded to an . advert, downloaded and quarantined the application pack and called in . American ‘phishing’ experts. Finding . the malware, he contacted Scotland Yard’s economic crime unit . while sending an email warning the gang to stop using Harrods name. In . total the gang placed 422 bogus job adverts for Harrods alone. Undeterred, . the gang continued to post more than 400 further fake job adverts for . other jobs such as a £25,000 sales assistant at a storage firm. Tracing the unique IP addresses used to post the jobs on Gumtree, police raided homes connected to the gang more than nine months after the first fake job adverts were posted in late August 2010. The whole gang were rounded up in 2012 and detectives found 108 identities that had been stolen, but fear the gang hacked many more. After showing an interest in the advert, the Old Bailey heard victims were sent an email pretending to be from the respected Blue Arrow recruitment . agency inviting them 'to fill in that application pack for further . consideration'. Once embedded, the software waited until the user tried to access their online bank accounts. The . unsuspecting user would then be redirected to fake sites 'which looked . all the world that it was a genuine bank site they were trying to . contact' before the gang’s software stole log on details. Most of the fraudsters were originally from Nigeria and living in South London. They were all studying, or had studied, IT. Today, British Tyrone Ellis, 27, his former classmate Awosile, Southampton Solent University graduate Ajibola Akinlabi, 26, Damilare Oduwole, 26, and Ademola Araoye, 29, were jailed for conspiracy to defraud. Gumtree: The free advertising website where people were tricked into applying for attractive jobs at Harrods by downloading software which then corrupted their computers and stole their security details . Jailing them for a total of more than 27 years, Judge Stephen Kramer QC said: 'Computer fraud is relatively easy for people like you who have the requisite knowledge to defraud people of their hard earned savings and money. 'In this case it was particularly mean those out of work and looking for jobs and thought they were on the way to obtaining jobs with reputable employers and in reality they were being defrauded. 'The fraud agreed could not have been carried out without each of you playing your parts. 'Creating the malware, using it to obtain bank details, placing bogus job adverts and seeing that cash stolen from members of the public whose accounts had been compromised.' Ellis . was jailed for four-and-a-half years; Awosile, Akinlabi, and Oduwole . were jailed for seven years each; and Araoye, who pleaded guilty before . trial, was given two years. Awosile and his ex-girlfriend Nadine Windley, 26, who worked as a Santander cashier and passed on bank details of account holders who had £9,800 stolen from them, were also jailed for fraud by abuse of position. However, Windley was given a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, and was ordered to carry out 150 hours of community service and a year’s supervision order.","Old Bailey heard gang could have earned up to £4 million from the scam .

A Silicon Valley jury on Thursday ordered Samsung Electronics to pay Apple $290 million for copying vital iPhone and iPad features. The verdict covers 13 older Samsung devices that a previous jury found were among 26 Samsung products that infringed Apple patents. The previous jury awarded Apple $1.05 billion. But U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ordered the new trial and tossed out $450 million of the damages after concluding the previous jury miscalculated the amount Samsung owed. Apple vs Samsung: A U.S. jury awarded Apple $290.45 million in a damages retrial against Samsung Electronics on Thursday, it is the latest battle in global patent litigation between the two mobile giants . Samsung appealed that verdict and is expected to appeal the latest verdict. A third trial is scheduled for March to consider Apple's claims that Samsung's newest devices on the market also copied Apple's technology. Apple and Samsung are the world's two biggest smartphone makers. The bitter rivals have been waging a global battle for supremacy of the $300 billion worldwide market. Apple has argued in courts, government tribunals and regulatory agencies around the world that Samsung's Android-based phones copy vital iPhone features. Samsung is fighting back with its own complaints that some key Apple patents are invalid and Apple has copied Samsung's technology. Samsung lawyer William Price argued Apple is misconstruing the breadth of its patents to include such things as the basic rectangle shape of most smartphones today. 'Apple doesn't own beautiful and sexy,' Price told the San Jose jury. Apple and Samsung are the world's two biggest smartphone makers and the bitter rivals have been waging a global battle for supremacy of the $300 billion worldwide market . Apple attorney William Lee told the jury that Samsung used Apple's technology to lift it from an also-ran in the smartphone market three years ago to the biggest seller of them in the world today. 'Apple can never get back to where it should have been in 2010,' Lee told the jury on Tuesday at the conclusion of the week-long trial. The fight in San Jose is particularly contentious. The courtroom is a 15-minute drive from Apple's Cupertino headquarters, and several prospective jurors were dismissed because of their ties to the company. The South Korean-based Samsung has twice sought to stop the trial, accusing Apple on Tuesday of unfairly trying to inflame patriotic passions by urging jurors to help protect American companies from overseas competitors. The judge denied Samsung's request for a mistrial, but did reread to reread an instruction ordering them to put aside their dislikes and biases in deciding the case. On Wednesday, Samsung again demanded a halt to the trial after the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office told Apple it was planning to invalidate a patent protecting the 'pinch-to-zoom' feature at issue in the jury's deliberation. The judge ordered more briefing while declining to stop the trial.","Verdict by Silicon Valley jury covers 13 older Samsung devices that a previous jury found were among 26 that infringed Apple patents .

A soldier returned home from the front line to find the dead body of his fiancee, who had hanged herself after suffering from postnatal depression. Linzi Mannion had told friends she was looking forward to marrying Lance Sergeant Robert Kopicki and was busily decorating their new home. But the mother of two committed suicide the night before her fiance returned from his post in Afghanistan and he discovered her body. Depression: Linzi Mannion (left), the fiancee of British soldier Lance Sgt Robert Kopicki, was found hanged at their home in Bolton, Manchester . They had spoken on the phone the night before and he said she seemed in good spirits. Shocked friends who had been with the 29-year-old hours before her death on August 30 said she seemed her ‘normal, jolly self’. An inquest yesterday heard she had been diagnosed with postnatal depression after the birth of  her second daughter Nancie on  April 24, and was prescribed anti-depressants. 'Impulse': Linzi, pictured left with her two . children and right with Mr Kopicki, was suffering from post-natal . depression and acted impulsively, a coroner said. Miss Mannion told . friends she was excited for the return of Mr Kopicki and was looking . forward to enjoying life at their new home . Sgt Kopicki, 28, who serves with the 1st Battalion Scots Guards, told the hearing: ‘After the birth Linzi began to suffer from depression. She had some anti-depressants from the GP which seemed to help her. In June she tried to harm herself but she was so upset and traumatised by that. She just couldn’t cope.’ Doctors who were monitoring the healthcare assistant had believed her condition was improving, and Sgt Kopicki didn’t suspect she was contemplating suicide. He said: ‘We were looking forward to getting married. The house was getting decorated and I was coming home the following day. On the evening before I came home I spoke to her and we exchanged texts. Inquest: The inquest has been held into the death of Linzi Mannion, the girlfriend of British soldier Lance Sgt Robert Kopicki who was serving in Afghanistan . 'She phoned me at 10.30pm when she was with all her friends. There was no warning of what was to happen. ‘When I came home I found Linzi and she had died.’ On the night of her death Miss Mannion, who also had an elder daughter Maddalyn, had been decorating her home in Kearsley, near Bolton, with the help of her friend Lee Bleakley, who she had known since she was 18. Mr Bleakley left around 9.30pm and Miss Mannion went to visit another friend and drank some wine. Later the same night Miss Mannion rang Mr Bleakley asking him to come back round to her home to finish off the decorating before Sgt Kopicki returned the next morning. Happy: Miss Mannion's friends said they had no reason to believe she would harm herself . Mr Bleakley said: ‘I said I would come round in the morning before Rob came back home to help with the decorating. She seemed all right when I spoke to her but a little bit drunk. We had been having a laugh and a joke that night and she was saying how happy she was with her kids. ‘I have known her a long time so I would know if there was something wrong. She just seemed the normal Linzi to me.’ Post-mortem examination results showed Miss Mannion was at more than twice the drink-drive limit, Bolton coroner’s court heard. Coroner Jennifer Leeming, who recorded an open verdict into Miss Mannion’s death, said there was nothing in her behaviour which could have indicated she was planning to take her own life. ‘Clearly it was impulsive,’ she said. ‘I suspect if she could, she would say that she didn’t really mean it. Please accept my sincere sympathy for your loss. Around 10-15 per cent of new mothers suffer from post-natal depression, but help is out there (file pic) Feeling 'low' after having a baby, . also known as the 'baby blues', is so common it is considered normal, . but 10-15 per cent of mothers go on to develop a much deeper and . long-term condition called post-natal depression (PND). It . usually develops within six weeks of giving birth and can come on . gradually or suddenly, and can range from being relatively mild to quite . severe. Sufferers may feel sad or low, unable to . cope, and hostile or indifferent to their husband, partner or baby. They may have thoughts about death, be unable to sleep, and feel . hopeless about the future. Many . of those who suffer from it do not want to admit to it, but doctors say . that if PND is diagnosed and addressed, it is likely to pass sooner and . to be less severe. Treatments . for PND include counselling and psychotherapy, and antidepressants, . which can be very effective.  Tranquilisers and sleeping pills may also . be offered for short-term use. Some . women find complementary therapies such as cranial osteopathy, massage, . and reflexology can be a help in reducing symptoms of depression and . anxiety.

A mother-of-13 who allegedly offered a friend nicknamed 'Mafia Mike' $10,000 to murder her husband in a staged hunting accident has been indicted. Wendy Farley, 46, was indicted by a grand jury on Monday at court in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine. Mrs Farley was formally charged with felony criminal solicitation for planning to have a friend murder her husband of 30 years and make it look like an accident so she could be free of his strictness and obsession with cleanliness, authorities said. Stoned-faced: Wendy Farley, right, was indicted on a felony charge of criminal solicitation on Monday at a Maine court . Farley is expected to return to court today. She remains at Piscataquis County Jail where she has been held since last September. Farley, a farmer's wife from Brownville, was arrested last year over the alleged murder-for-hire scheme of her husband Luther 'Rusty' Farley. Investigators had . received a tip from a man identified as Michael . ‘Mafia Mike’ Anderson, of Milo, who told them that Farley contacted him . and offered between $3,000 and $10,000 in cash for killing her husband. Officials . then set up a wiretap operation in order to record the . conversations between the would-be hit man-turned-informant and the . suspect. In the secret recording made by Anderson, . who owns a local taxi company, Farley could be heard saying that she . wanted her husband shot dead with a standard, .30-30 hunting rifle, the . affidavit stated. The 46-year-old women went on to clarify . that she wanted 'nothing fancy, nothing stupid, nothing traceable,' documents stated. Suspect: Farley, 46, was charged with trying to hire a hit man to kill her husband and father of her 13 children . 'A straight hit, that's what I want,' the woman was allegedly recorded telling her acquaintance. 'One shot - drop him.' When Anderson inquired why she wanted her . husband dead, she allegedly replied that while her spouse had never . physically abused her or their children, his strictness has been . oppressive to the point that some of their adult children were forced to . leave the farm. 'He's out, he's gone, I'm free,' Farley was quoted. 'Kids can grow up unafraid to be kids.' Farley, . who has been described by friends and neighbors as a good wife and . mother, admitted to police that she had cheated on her husband with . other men and used the Internet to research ways to poison him. District . Court Judge Kevin Stitham ordered the woman held on $10,000 cash bail. Farley is banned from having any contact with her husband or Anderson, . but she is permitted to see her children. Visits with her children who are minors are under supervision. Farley's friend Merry Burton was . shocked by the murder-for-hire allegations. She described the . 46-year-old suspect as a bright, joyful woman who liked to sing and play . guitar at open-mic nights. 'She was home-schooling her kids, she is a very good mom and is one of the hardest workers I know,' Burton said. Informant: Farley allegedly approached Michael Anderson, right, about having her husband killed, but he tipped off police about the plot and help them set up a wiretap . 'I only have good to say about her. I can't imagine any of this happening. There’s got to be more to the story,' she added. The . friend went on to say that Farley never discussed her marriage. Some . years ago, the mother of 13 stopped having babies and started losing . weight, 'sort of like a flower emerging,' Burton said. 'She has been a brood mare for 30 years. It is about time she was doing something for herself,' Burton said. Luther 'Rusty' Farley was not in court on Thursday, but according to the affidavit, he was deeply disturbed upon learning of his wife's alleged plot on his life and her extramarital affairs. He staggered when told about the allegations, and a police officer who came to arrest his wife had to steady the man. At one point, Mr Farley said he wanted . to see his wife to forgive her, explaining that while he had never hit . her, he moved out temporarily about a month ago following an argument, . the affidavit states, but the couple have since reconciled. Farley . told police repeatedly that ‘he could think of no reason why his wife . had tried to have him killed’ except that 'he was very particular about . the order and cleanliness of the house and stated that about once a year . he would get very angry because it would eat at him that she was so . messy'. Wendy Farley, however, said she found her husband demeaning. ‘If you could imagine for 29 years . being told you were not good enough. … I finally snapped,’she told . police. Prospectors, however, said that during . interviews with Farley, the woman appeared stoic and unemotional, . creating the impression that she is not the kind of person who would . suddenly lose her cool.

Armed robber Alan Levers died while robbing a bookmakers in Plymouth, Devon, after a customer tackled him . An armed robber died when he was confronted by a have-a-go hero during a bungled raid on a bookmakers, an inquest heard. Career criminal Alan Levers, 50, was wearing a black gas mask and carrying an imitation handgun when he was wrestled to the ground by a brave customer. The man, known only as Robert, told an inquest he leapt into action when Levers stormed into the Ladbrokes branch in Plymouth, Devon, shortly before 7pm on January 25 this year. Robert grabbed the robber in an arm lock around his throat and wrestled him to the floor - just seconds after Levers pointed a fake 9mm pistol at the betting shop manager and demanded cash. Two brothers, also in the shop on Crownhill Road, went to help and knocked the pistol out of the gunman's hand, before holding the father of three down until police arrived. Police noticed that Levers, an alcoholic and former heroin addict, was not responding to their commands. They then removed his gas mask and found he was unconscious. An inquest in Plymouth heard paramedics were unable to revive Levers and he was pronounced dead later that night. Ian Arrow, coroner for Plymouth and South West Devon, recorded a narrative conclusion after hearing there was no evidence those restraining Levers committed any offence. Death: Police stand guard outside the Ladbrokes betting shop in Plymouth, Devon, where Alan Levers died after trying to raid it with an imitation gun and a gas mask . Robert, who asked not to give his full name publicly, told the hearing he was playing on a gaming machine near the counter of the bookies when Levers entered. As the man approached the desk, Robert noticed a 9mm pistol in his right hand pocket and decided to act when the man pulled it out. 'At that point I decided on instinct, jumped on him from behind and wrestled him to the floor,' Robert said. 'I was frantically trying to get the gun out of his hand. The man was struggling quite considerably and I was scared to let him up because I was concerned he might have had potentially some unconventional weapon like a knife or a screwdriver that could do as much damage.' Robert said he and another man held the man down and noticed he had stopped struggling but 'presumed he had accepted defeat. 'He was going to be apprehended by the police and he realised he was never going to win,' he added. CCTV footage of the incident, captured on two camera inside the bookies, was also played to the inquest. John Doyle, who was in the branch with his brother Patrick when Levers walked in, witnessed Robert leap into action. Inquest: Police stand outside the Ladbrokes betting shop where Alan Levers was confronted by three customers who held him down while police were called . 'I said to my brother Paddy ""Get out of the shop, he's got a gun"",' he said in a written statement. 'Before I had reached the shop door, I saw the robber raise the gun from waist level to chest level and point it directly at the cashier. 'I knew straight away this was an armed robbery and I was in complete fear for mine and everyone else's safety inside the shop. I was totally fearful that I would get shot. 'I saw the man who had been using the gaming machine move very quickly across the shop floor and take the robber down to the ground. 'He did this using his right arm going across the man's neck. A lot of force was used to get the man to the ground. 'Seeing the robber still had the gun I ran back towards them and as I did I kicked the robber to the right side of his ribcage to try and get him to release the gun. 'He was struggling to get to his feet. I punched out at him several times at his hand to try and make him release the gun. He did not let go so I shouted over to my brother Paddy to help us get the gun off him and I said ""Stamp on his hand"". 'Paddy kicked the gun out of his right hand. The offender was struggling for a few minutes and then seemed to relax. Alan Levers (left) died after a botched raid at the bookmakers. Two uniformed police officers arrived at the scene and conducted CPR on Levers after discovering he was unconscious but he couldn't be saved . 'There was no malice or going over the top from the man assisting me in detaining the male and he, the same as me, was trying to prevent any serious harm or loss of life coming to anyone in the shop or the surrounding area.' Ladbrokes worker Adam Davies described the incident: 'He said ""I want the money now"" or something similar - I wasn't really scared I was more startled.' Two uniformed police officers arrived at the scene and conducted CPR on Levers after discovering he was unconscious. A post-mortem examination later found Levers had 289mg of alcohol in 100ml blood - meaning he was more than three and a half times the drink drive limit. Pathologist Dr Russell Delaney said Levers had suffered a cardiac arrest after the gas mask had restricted his breathing. 'His chest has also been compressed during a period of restraint and the restriction of chest movements reduces the effectiveness of breathing,' he added. He gave the cause of death as a combination of chest compression, restricted breathing and alcohol intake. After investigating the incident police fully exonerated those involved in restraining Levers. Levers' partner Julie Lidstone provided a lengthy statement to the inquest, which detailed how he had been trying to overcome his alcohol addiction but was short of money because he had been unable to work as a roofer because of bad weather. Speaking after the inquest, Ms Lidstone said: 'I am sorry for what the witnesses were put through at Ladbrokes. 'What happened should never have happened in the first place and Alan paid the ultimate price.'

Symbol: The estate in Waiblingen Way, Devizes, looks like the Nazi symbol . Hated: The swastika has become inextricably linked with Germany's Nazi Party . He told The Sun: 'I was looking at some aerial pictures and was gobsmacked by it.' The small estate was built in the 1950s or 60s and is named after a small town near Stuttgart, Germany. Waiblingen Way has an average house price of about £220,000 and the strangely-shaped block is at the end of a cul-de-sac. Wiltshire Council said it did not know who designed the homes. Devizes is also twinned with Mayenne, France, in a link that was set up in the 1960s. Nazis adopted the swastika and used the symbol of the German eagle standing on top of the swastika as the party logo. The original symbol dates back hundreds of years and has been used in civilisations across the globe including Africa, Asia and Europe.

The pharmacist, who lives in Grimbsy, had been visiting his girlfriend's relatives and had hired a beach house in Baybay, one of the ravaged coastal villages, according to Channel 4 News. Missing: Colin Bembridge, 61, with his Filipino partner Maybelle, 35, and their three-year-old daughter Victoria who are among the missing in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan . Relatives have appealed for help finding Victoria and her parents, who went missing the day the storm struck . Typhoon Haiyan has left up to 10,000 dead and many more homeless, and large numbers of survivors are struggling without food, water and shelter. The mother of Mr Bembridge's partner, 79-year-old Lydia revealed pictures of the wrecked beach house where her daughter and granddaughter had been staying on Channel 4 News. 'I just want to know whether they are dead or whether they were blown by the winds,' she told the programme. While searching the wreckage she found a dress belonging to Maybelle - the youngest of her eight children - and a games console belonging to Victoria. She added: 'Now that I am here I cannot see them. I am at a loss of where they are. My heart, it's hurting.' Search: Victoria's grandmother (pictured here with the missing three-year-old) searched the wrecked beach house in Baybay near Tacloban but could only find clothes and a games console . Family: Mr Bembridge, from Grimsby, had been visiting his partner's relatives when Typhoon Haiyan hit last week . Winds of up to 235mph and gusts of 170mph . left a trail of destruction last week - triggering major landslides, knocking out . power and communications and causing catastrophic widespread damage. Hundreds of homes have been flattened and scores of streets flooded. Workers in Tacloban have been burying scores of unidentified bodies in a mass grave as desperately-needed aid begins to arrive. According to the country's national disaster agency, four million people were affected. About 15,000 British nationals are said to live on the islands and every year 65,000 visit tourist hotspots like northern Cebu Province and Boracay Island, both of which have been savaged by the storm. A multimillion pound aid project has now been launched to care for the homeless and wounded and to find missing people. Plea: Lydia, the mother of Maybelle (pictured with Victoria) said: 'I just want to know whether they are dead' Distraught: 79-year-old Lydia, searching for her family, told Channel 4 News: 'My heart is hurting' More than £30million has been raised by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) in just three days. The alliance of 14 UK aid charities said the funds raised will be used to deliver vital food, water and sanitation equipment, household items and building materials to rebuild essential infrastructure in the ruined areas. Its chief executive Saleh Saeed said: 'The DEC member agencies and their partners are working on the ground to deliver essential aid. 'But the needs are so great, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. People desperately need the basics of food, water and shelter.' So far 2,357 people have been confirmed dead and 3,853 injured. The DEC said fuel in the provincial capital of Tacloban was expected to run out within days.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening told workers and troops at Brize Norton: 'We have been one of the countries that has really been part of trying to get humanitarian aid through to the people on the ground. 'But what we know is we have to get the logistics operation up and running and that means clearing the roads. 'You cannot do that without the right equipment.

Dismissive: David Cameron said he though we 'should stick to our non-horse eating habits' David Cameron yesterday dismissed a suggestion by Princess Anne that Britons should start eating horsemeat. The Prime Minister, who like the Princess Royal is an enthusiastic rider, said he was ‘not keen’ on the idea. Princess Anne this week argued that Britain should consider eating horsemeat as they do in France, to improve standards of care for the animals. At the annual conference of World Horse Welfare, of which she is president, she said those in the trade ‘value their horses and look after them well’, adding: ‘Should we be considering a real market for horsemeat and would that reduce the number of welfare cases? I think this needs a debate.’ But when Mr Cameron was asked whether he thought the UK should embrace horse fillet steaks – a French delicacy - he appeared to turn up his nose at the idea. He said: ‘I’m not keen on eating horse. I know it’s something that happens in other countries but I think we should stick to our non-horse eating habits.’ Mr Cameron declined to say whether he has eaten horse. The Prime Minister’s stance puts him at odds with Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who said he would happily eat horse products during the horse meat scandal earlier this year. Hungry? Princess Anne this week suggested that Britons start to eat horses . Horsemeat was found in a wide range of meat products in supermarkets in January. Findus withdrew lasagnes from the shelves and Tesco found that horsemeat accounted for approximately 29 per cent of the meat in its Everyday Value beef burgers. The discoveries led to a report by the  Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committee which recommended that for trust in the frozen meat sector to be restored, those responsible for the scandal should be identified and prosecuted. However, to date no one has ever been punished.","David Cameron said he was 'not keen' on the idea of eating horse .

Community shattered: Police officers carry a body from a wiped out village near Tacloban City, Leyte . Run aground: Survivors walks past two ships that ran ashore in Tacloban City in the chaos unleashed by Typhoon Haiyan . He said: 'About two thirds of it has been destroyed but in comparison to some of the other buildings it did quite well. 'Then when the high winds hit last Friday my wife and I just held hands in our tent and prayed that it would pass. 'Now Loon looks completely unrecognisable, the whole population are desperately short of supplies and the whole island is without power. 'The only way aid can get through is by helicopter or by making a five hour dangerous journey through the mountains where there are a lot of landslides.' In pieces: Filipino men walk through the smoke as they burn debris from a church ravaged by Typhoon Haiyan in Tacloban, Philippines . Rebuilding: Survivors wash appliances outside their damaged home in Tacloban city where U.S. and UK aid has begun to arrive . Yet despite his situation Mr Carter is determined to stay put. He said: 'Loon is my home and there is nothing that would make me leave it or the people here. ‘I intend to completely rebuild my house and will not give up until it's completely restored, however long it may take.' The search for missing Brit Colin Bembridge, 61, from Grimsby, continues. Mr Bembridge was staying in the coastal village of Baybay visiting his 35-year-old Filipino girlfriend Maybelle and their three-year-old daughter Victoria. Hunger: Survivors run for food dropped by an airforce helicopter outside Tacloban today . The mother of Mr Bembridge's partner, 79-year-old Lydia, showed the programme the wreckage of the beach house where her daughter and granddaughter had been staying. She said: 'I am at a loss of where they are. My heart, it's hurting.' He is one of a number of British nationals who remain unaccounted for following the typhoon. A Foreign Office spokesman said William Hague phoned the Philippines Secretary for Foreign Affairs Albert Ferreros Del Rosario this afternoon to offer his condolences. 'The Foreign Secretary confirmed that a number of British nationals remained unaccounted for,' he added. 'He asked that every possible assistance be given to any British people caught up in the disaster.' Sending help: US sailors from the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, as well as French humanitarian volunteers, load relief supplies for villagers isolated by Haiyan at Tacloban airport . Coming together: Aid is unloaded from a military plane at Tacloban city airport, from where it will be distributed to the affected towns and villages . Meanwhile, the first food and medical aid has begun to reach isolated towns in the island nation as both the UK and the U.S. pledge further help. Donations by the British public to charity appeal in support for the victims has reached an impressive £33million as an RAF plane . carrying heavy duty vehicles and emergency medical supplies arrived in . the Philippines as part of the UK's emergency response to the disaster. The . huge C-17 transport plane touched down in Cebu province to deliver two . JCB diggers, two Land Rovers and a forklift truck shortly after 8am . after leaving RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire yesterday morning. A 12-strong team of British doctors, . surgeons and paramedics are already in the devastated Asian country . helping to treat survivors of the typhoon. The unprecedented ferocity of Super Typhoon Haiyan on November 8 and the scale of destruction it caused completely overwhelmed the initial relief effort, leaving millions in the worst-hit central islands of Leyte and Samar hurt, homeless and hungry, with no power or water. Eight days after Haiyan, a working aid pipeline was in place on the ground, funnelling emergency supplies to those left destitute in the ruins of Tacloban city, on Leyte, one of the worst hit central islands, while helicopters flying off the aircraft carrier USS George Washington brought some relief to outlying areas. The Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) said they would have mobile surgical units up and running in Tacloban by the end of the weekend. 'The place really needs to be saturated with relief,' Red Cross Asia-Pacific spokesman Patrick Fuller said in Tacloban. 'People literally have nothing. Money is useless here.' Relatives light candles at a makeshift grave site on a field in Palo town, Leyte, where residents have been forced to hurry the burial of relatives and unknown people as they have started to decay . Humanitarian help: A Philippine Army rescue soldier holding a Filipino child while waiting to load on an aircraft for transport to Manila at the Tacloban airfield . Human cost of the tragedy: The death toll has passed 3,000 and survivors cover their noses as they pass bodybags along the streets in Tacloban City . Since the arrival of the USS George Washington late Thursday, the U.S. military said it had delivered 118 tonnes of food, water and shelter items to Tacloban and elsewhere, and airlifted nearly 2,900 people to safety. Japan confirmed it would send almost 1,200 troops to join relief efforts along with three warships, 10 planes and six helicopters - its military's single largest aid deployment. Earlier, David Cameron announced the Government is to give an extra £30million in aid, bringing the total amount to £50million. Speaking at a press conference in Sri Lanka ahead of the Commonwealth summit, the Prime Minister said the scale of the disaster is 'becoming clearer every day'. Five UK Government flights have now delivered aid packages and at least seven more are planned to leave. These have so far delivered 14,988 shelter kits, 17,369 tarpaulins, 11,230 hygiene kits, 5,925 jerry cans and nine 4x4s. Mr Cameron said: 'Today, I can announce we are providing another £30million to support the UN and the Red Cross emergency appeals and we are also supplying an RAF C-130 Hercules aircraft to help ensure aid workers can move between the worst affected areas and get aid to those who need it. 'A week after Typhoon Haiyan hit, the scale of the disaster is becoming clearer every day - over 3,600 dead, nearly 12 million affected. 'They are going to need sustained help from the international community as they start to rebuild their lives. 'I'm proud of the fact that the UK has taken the lead in international relief with rapid response of warships, aircraft and equipment.' Helping hands: Walking through the rubble, survivors form a line to receive relief goods at a devastated coastal area in Leyte, Philippines . Surveying the damage: A military aircraft passes over the washed out coastal villages of Tacloban city . Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious is also being sent to replace HMS Daring, which has already been deployed to the Philippines. The latest death toll given by Mr Cameron is an increase of more than 1,000 on estimates made by the country's civil defence agency earlier this week. But some officials estimate that the final toll, when the missing are declared dead and remote regions are reached, will be more than 10,000. 'We don't know how we'll start again,' said Benny Creer, 53, as he helped a relative sweep debris from his shattered home in Tacloban. 'In this situation, there are no poor, no rich - everyone is equal,' Creer said. In Giporlos, a small coastal town of around 12,000 people in eastern Samar where the typhoon first struck, a US Seahawk helicopter flew in the first relief supplies Saturday, landing in the playground of a ruined elementary school. 'We're very happy even if it isn't really sufficient for us,' said resident Maria Elvie Depelco. 'We accept a little, and we survive. Because there's no more food, no houses here,' she said, pointing to the flattened remains of the town where 12 people died.","David Carter, 69, watched his home in the Philippines destroyed in typhoon .

A former soldier from Fiji has won his battle to stay in the UK after issuing a personal appeal to Prime Minister David Cameron. Filimone Lacanivalu - who served with . the Army for nine years - was facing deportation after he failed to fill . in the necessary forms on his discharge from the service. But after his case was taken up in the press and by MPs, he has now been told that he can settle in Britain. Years of service: Filimon Lacanialu, left, is pictured on patrol in the Falkland Islands . Mr Lacanivalu, who served with the 2nd . Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Northern . Ireland, said he was a 'happy man' now that his case had been resolved. 'I have been in the forces, I've put . in effort, sacrificed my life for this country. I just think to stay . here will be a benefit, there's more opportunities,' he told BBC Radio . 4's Today programme. Home Secretary Theresa May and . immigration minister Mark Harper were reported to have personally . reviewed his case before deciding he could remain. Mr Lacanivalu, who spent five weeks in . a detention centre awaiting deportation to Fiji, said it had never been . explained to him that he would need to apply to remain in the UK when . he left the Army. 'I was not aware of that because I did . not receive any instructions from the Army itself or the Ministry of . Defence before I left the forces,' he said. Pte Lacanivalu was held at Harmondsworth immigration detention centre, near Heathrow, awaiting deportation on Sunday. Others held at the centre include murderers, rapists and drug dealers. Reprieve: Pte Lacanivalu begged the Prime Minister to intervene and let him stay in the country because of his military service . Last night he said he felt ‘betrayed’ by Britain. He said: ‘It is confusing, sad and depressing. In . his plea to Mr Cameron, he said: 'Please take account of my military . service and what I have done for Great Britain. Release me from here and . I will continue my life as usual.’ Campaigners . for Pte Lacanivalu contrasted his case with that of foreigners who have . been allowed to stay in Britain despite awful crimes, such as Iraqi Aso . Mohammed Ibrahim, who left a girl of 12 to die under the wheels of his . car. His case also appeared at odds with Mr Cameron’s pledge to uphold the Military Covenant, society’s duty of care to servicemen. Pte Lacanivale, whose uncles served in the Army, including one who fought with the Parachute Regiment in the Falklands, signed up with 2 YORKS in 2001 after seeing photographs of ceremonial parades at Buckingham Palace. He served in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, the Falklands and deployed on two tours of fierce fighting in Afghanistan. He left the Forces in January 2010 but several months later received documents from the Army informing him he should have applied for residency within 28 days. The soldier claimed he was not told of this requirement while in the Army. He hired a solicitor to issue a belated application to remain in Britain but he was informed in September he had been rejected. On October 12 he went to a Home Office centre in Croydon, South London, hoping to resolve the situation but he was detained without being allowed to return to his flat to collect his belongings.","Private Filimone Lacanivalu signed up to the army in 2001 .

A toddler who desperately needs a bone marrow transplant has been found a match after he inspired a 10-fold increase in the number of Asian donors. Doctors told Gaurav Bains's family he could become seriously ill if he did not have a transplant by Christmas, as he was likely to develop an aggressive form of childhood leukaemia. But thanks to an overwhelming response, the two-year-old has been found a match and will undergo a potentially life-saving transplant next month. Gaurav Bains (pictured with his mother, Gurprit) needs a bone marrow transplant before Christmas or it is likely he will develop an aggressive form of childhood leukaemia . Gaurav, from Tipton in the West Midlands, was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called Monosomy 7 in June. His parents, Sunny and Gurpit, launched a public appeal for donors in September after failing to find a match within their family. They used social media and blogged to find a donor for their son, whose illness means he has to be admitted to hospital if he suffers a simple cough or cold. As a result, there was a huge increase in the number of Asian people applying to become a bone marrow donor on the Anthony Nolan register. Mr Bains said: ‘When we were told that there was a matching donor, we just couldn't believe it. ‘Our feelings towards Gaurav's donor are overwhelming because that person is giving Gaurav such an important gift. If I could, I would go to meet Gaurav's donor right now and give them the biggest hug in the world. None of Gaurav's relatives were matches so his parents launched a campaign to find a donor. It inspired a 10-fold increase in the number of Asian people joining the bone marrow donor register . ‘A matching donor means that we can go ahead with Gaurav's bone marrow transplant. It is a very serious procedure but we know that it will give Gaurav the best possible chance at survival. ‘We hope that having the support of those around us will give us the strength we will need to get through the challenges ahead.’ Anthony Nolan estimates that more than 3,000 people from all backgrounds have joined the bone marrow register as a result of Gaurav's appeal. The blood cancer charity revealed that 480 Asian people applied to the bone marrow register online in September and October, compared to 40 joining the register in the same period the previous year. A donor has been found as a result of the campaign. This means Gaurav (pictured with his father, Sunny) will be able to have the transplant next month . Mr Bains said: ‘Friends, family, and people who we have never met before have backed the campaign to recruit more donors and we would like to thank everyone who has been involved. ‘Every single person who has joined the register could be a match for someone in desperate need of a transplant and help another family out there. ‘No one can imagine what it is like to be in the position of needing a bone marrow donor for your child until you experience it. We have been very fortunate in finding a donor and I know that it is not the case for every family. ‘The campaign was never just about finding a donor for Gaurav. It was about ensuring that there will be matching donors for years to come - for our children's families and grandchildren's families. Mr Bains said: 'Friends, family, and people who we have never met before have backed the campaign to recruit more donors and we would like to thank everyone who has been involved' ‘As a community, I want us to continue this campaign to recruit more bone marrow donors so that every family is able to find a donor for their loved one.’ Bhaveshree Chandegra, Asian recruitment manager at Anthony Nolan, said: ‘We are absolutely delighted that a matching donor has been found for Gaurav. ‘His story has inspired so many people to sign up as donors and, in particular, we have seen a huge increase in the number of Asian donors on the bone marrow register. ‘Asian patients in desperate need of a bone marrow transplant still have just a 40 per cent chance of finding a match. ‘It is so important that more Asian people sign up as bone marrow donors so that we can help more people like Gaurav in the future and so that no family has to go through an agonising wait to find out if they have a match.’ About 1,800 people need a bone marrow or stem cell transplant every year in the UK – it is usually their last chance of survival. Some 63 per cent of UK patients will not find a matching donor within their families. According to Anthony Nolan, a suitable donor can only be found for around half the people who need a life-saving bone marrow transplant. Most donations – 90 per cent - now take place via peripheral blood stem cell collection, which is done at an outpatient appointment and is similar to donating blood.","Gaurav Bains, two, has a rare blood disorder called Monosomy 7 .

A Rutgers University football player on the Scarlett Knights has come forward with claims that the team's coach has been verbally abusing and bullying players. Freshman cornerback, Jevon Tyree, 19, quit the football team on November 6 after coach Dave Cohen called him profanities and once even threatened to 'head-butt him during a study hall session.' There were 10 students and a tutor present during the incident. Jevon's parents, Mark and Clarice, are outraged by the 'bullying' and are seeking disciplinary action against Cohen. Rutgers defensive coordinator Dave Cohen is accused of severely bullying and excluding one of his players . 'I really think disciplinary action should happen, almost to the point where (Cohen) should get fired. I really do,' Mark Tyree told NJ.com . 'He was just trying to really make me feel as if I was soft.' Tyree said. 'He got all up in my face. Coach Cohen has a lisp , so he was in my face telling me he'll head-butt me, and he was kind of spitting in my face as he was saying it. I was just pulling my head back, looking at him like, is this guy out of his mind? Is he crazy?,' Tyree told NJ.com. Jevon Tyree quit the team on November 6 after months of name-calling and exclusion from team practice . The school issued a statement about the alleged bullying that said, 'at no time was there any threat of physical violence, which was verified by an academic counselor, who was present in the room.' The statement also said that the head coach, Kyle Flood, spoke with Cohen about his behavior and that the next day the coach apologized. Tyree's parents were not placated by the statement which says that they met with the school several times and felt that the issue was resolved. The statement claimed that athletic director Julie Hermann spoke with Jevon's father and that they, 'confirmed that the matter was resolved to his satisfaction.' The family says this is untrue. In fact, Mark Tyree has been unable to have a meeting with Hermann despite his numerous attempts. Julie Hermann, Athletic Director of Rutgers University, didn't make herself available to meet with Jevon's family even though a statement issued by the school says she did . 'We didn't even want this to escalate to the athletic director,' Mark Tyree told The Star Ledger. 'We were trying to keep this in-house. I wasn't trying to go to the [university] president and the NCAA. I was like, 'Hey, let's try to resolve this.' According to Mark Tyree, Flood said, 'Mr. Tyree, I'm not going to tell you how I discipline my coaches.' I understand that, because that's in-house stuff, but what happens if nothing happens? How do you know? Where is the letter filed to (Hermann)?' In addition to bullying, Jevon feels as though was given less playing time unfairly. He also wasn't invited to meetings that secondary coach Darell Wilson held with the rest of the cornerbacks. 'Obviously, if every single corner(back) is going to a meeting and not me, there is something up,' Tyree said. Tyree decided to leave the team after On Nov.2, the Scarlet Knights, whose secondary had been racked by injuries, played a wide receiver at cornerback against Temple instead of Tyree, reported ESPN. The Rutgers Scarlet Knight rides through the endzone in the game against Temple University on Nov. 2 that Jevon never got to play . Tyree believes the bullying was instigated after he pulled a hamstring during a 40-yard dash. He thinks this made Cohen think of him as a less valuable player. The bullying escalated over time. Basically, my dad went in there and told Coach Cohen there's going to be no more bullying towards me,"" Jevon Tyree said. ""Basically that's what it was -- I was just bullied by him for no reason."" Rutgers' statement may be aimed at trying to save the school's reputation after they were forced to fire college basketball coach Mark Rice for bullying. NBC reports that Rice has since apologized for the bullying incident that got him fired and said, 'there were some actions that were definitely bullying.' Rice was recorded on camera throwing balls at players and using gay slurs during team practice. After the video was broadcast on ESPN, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie asked Rutgers to fire Rice. The Tyree family thinks that Cohen should get the same punishment. Jevon, who is cousins with former NY Giant player David Tyree, wants to continue playing football even if it means he has to transfer schools. Jevon is related to NFL player David Tyree who played for the NY Giants .","Jevon Tyree, 19, is the cousin of former NY Giants player David Tyree .

The test, which could cost less than £2, could distinguish between cancers that are life-threatening and those which are comparatively harmless. Although prostate cancer is by far the most common form of cancer in men, with around 41,000 new cases and 10,700 deaths each year, many sufferers do not need treatment. Breakthrough: A single protein can be used to distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from that which can be managed. Scientists hope the discovery will revolutionise treatment of the disease . Three quarters of them have slow-growing tumours that need nothing more than to be monitored. But until now there have been no reliable tests to distinguish between harmless cancers and the deadly aggressive varieties. Tens of thousands of men undergo surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy simply as a precaution – which often leaves them incontinent and their sexual desire severely impaired. The new blood test developed by scientists at Cambridge University assesses the level of the protein NAALADL2, which is very high in men with aggressive cancers and causes prostate cancer cells to spread to other organs. Research published in the journal Oncogene found that the protein test could correctly distinguish the aggressive tumours. The scientists hope that the test will be available on the NHS in the next five to ten years. Clinical trials will begin next year. Dr Hayley Whitaker, lead author of the study, said: ‘At the moment, men with prostate cancer have a lot of very difficult decisions to make based on not very much evidence. ‘This test would run on technology which is already routinely used in the NHS. It would cost a couple of pounds, maximum.’ Referring to her research, she said: ‘This is an important step along the path to developing a much-sought-after test that could distinguish between different types of prostate cancer.’ At present, men are given the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. It measures levels of a different type of protein, which are normally raised if a tumour is present. Specialists also look at the cells under x-ray to try to determine how quickly they are growing – but experts say both methods are inadequate. Human prostate cancer cells. With the new test, much higher levels of the protein, NAALADL2, were found in prostate tumour tissue than in healthy tissue . Dr Iain Frame, Director of Research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘Being able to distinguish aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancers could transform the outlook for the 40,000 men who are faced with a diagnosis of the disease every year. ‘The current diagnostic process is at best inadequate. ‘All too often men are faced with the difficult decision of whether to endure life-changing side effects from treatment for cancers which may never have caused them any harm. Others, however, are left with more aggressive cancers that are untreated until it’s too late. ‘If we are to save more of the 10,000 men who lose their lives to this disease every year, this urgently needs to be addressed.’ Professor Malcolm Mason, Cancer Research UK’s prostate cancer expert, who is based at the University of Cardiff, said: ‘As a prostate cancer clinician, I have been waiting for years for a test that can define the aggressive disease. ‘I hope that this research brings forward the day when I can say to patients, “We know that your cancer doesn’t need treatment” – a crucial development that could spare thousands of patients from enduring arduous treatment with unpleasant side effects. ‘This extremely interesting study provides an important development for prostate cancer screening, and potentially even reveals a new target for the development of new prostate cancer drugs in the future.’ n THE number of children beating cancer has risen to more than eight in ten, according to figures from Cancer Research UK. In the 1960s, only three in ten survived after diagnosis, said a spokesman for the charity. Survival rates for liver and bone tumours have made ‘particularly good progress’, with five-year survival rates increasing from 67 to 82 per cent for liver tumours and 61 to 68 per cent for bone cancer. But he warned there is ‘still some way to go’ with other forms of the disease.","There are higher levels of the protein NAALADL2 in aggressive tumours .

A yearlong study of a coal-colored rock from the Red Planet that was found in the Sahara Desert has revealed that not only is it older than other Martian meteorites, but it also contains 10 times more water than the rest. The baseball-size meteorite, estimated to be 2 billion years old, is strikingly similar to the volcanic rocks examined on the Martian surface by the NASA rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which found water-bearing minerals. Black Beauty: An examination of the Martian meteorite known as NWA 7034 that landed in the Sahara Desert determined it is 2.1 billion years old and is water-rich . NWA 7034 is made of cemented fragments of basalt, rock that forms from rapidly cooled lava. The fragments are primarily feldspar and pyroxene, most likely from volcanic activity. This unusual meteorite's chemistry matches that of the Martian crust as measured by NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers and Mars Odyssey Orbiter. ‘Here we have a piece of Mars that I can hold in my hands. That's really exciting,’ said Carl Agee, director of the Institute of Meteoritics and curator at the University of New Mexico who led the study published online Thursday in the journal Science. 'This Martian meteorite has everything in its composition that you'd want in order to further our understanding of the Red Planet,' he said. 'This unique meteorite tells us what volcanism was like on Mars 2 billion years ago. 'It also gives us a glimpse of ancient surface and environmental conditions on Mars that no other meteorite has ever offered.' A scan of the meteorite: White material is ilmenite, light gray crystals are Cl-apatite, medium dark crystals are andesine, darkest crystals are sanidine (K-feldspar), and white fine . grained crystals are magnetite or other iron-oxide . Most space rocks that fall to Earth as meteorites originate in the asteroid belt, but a number come from the moon and Mars. Scientists believe an asteroid or some other large object struck Mars, dislodging rocks and sending them hurling into space. Occasionally, some plummet through Earth's atmosphere. Short of sending a spacecraft or astronaut to the Red Planet to haul back rocks, Martian meteorites are the next best thing for scientists seeking to better understand how Earth's neighbor transformed from a tropical environment to a frigid desert. Light microscopy images of a feldspar grain in the NWA 7034 meteorite showing the different particles researchers found . About 110 Martian rocks have been . recovered on Earth, mostly in Antarctica or the Sahara. The oldest dates . back 4.5 billion years to a time when Mars was warmer and wetter. About half a dozen Martian meteorites are 1.3 billion years old and the rest are 600 million years or younger. The . latest meteorite Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034 - nicknamed ‘Black . Beauty’- was donated to the University of New Mexico by an American who . bought it from a Moroccan meteorite dealer last year. The latest meteorite Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034 - nicknamed ¿Black Beauty¿- was donated to the University of New Mexico by an American who bought it from a Moroccan meteorite dealer last year. Ancient find: This Mars rock, which fell in Abu Hommos, Egypt in 1911, is particularly large meteorite from the Red Planet . Unusual discovery: Scientists believe that the meteorite found in Sahara was formed by cooling lava in the Martian crust . Researchers performed a battery of tests on the meteorite and based on its chemical signature confirmed that it was blasted to Earth from Mars. Almost all Martian meteorites can be put . in one of three groups known as Shergotty, Nakhla, and Chassigny - named for the locations where the first of each type of meteorite was discovered - which scientists refer to simply as SNC. But according to researchers, the Sahara find belongs in a class of its own. One of a kind: Unlike other Martian meteorites, the 'Black Beauty' does not fit into any pf the existing classifications of rocks from the Red Planet . Missing link: The Sahara find may help scientists understand how Earth's neighbor transformed from a tropical environment to a frigid desert . At 2.1 billion years old, it's the second-oldest known Martian meteorite that formed from a volcanic eruption. When the researchers compared the geochemical makeup of the meteorite to data from soil and rock samples obtained by Martian rovers, they discovered that it likely came from the planet's crust, not its mantle. While researchers have found meteorites formed from chunks of basalt cemented together in the moon's crust, they have never seen anything like this on Mars. There's also evidence that it was altered by water. Though the amount released during heating was small - 6,000 parts per million - it was still about 10 times more than other Martian meteorites. Scientists said this suggested there was interaction with water near the surface during a time when the planet was mostly dry and dusty. Outer space: Rocknest 3 is a rock approximately 15 inches long and 4 inches tall, next to the Rocknest patch of windblown dust and sand where Curiosity scooped and analyzed soil samples . Martian mission: A rock outcrop called Link pops out from a Martian surface that is elsewhere blanketed by reddish-brown dust, showing evidence for an ancient, flowing stream . More tests are under way to determine how long the rock floated in space and how long it had been sitting in the Sahara. University of Alberta meteorite expert Chris Herd said the find was welcome since most Martian rocks that rain on Earth tend to be younger. The latest find does not appear to be too contaminated, he said. ‘It's fairly fresh. 'It hasn't been subjected to a whole lot of weathering,’ said Herd, who had no role in the research . The discovery of the 'Black Beauty' meteorite may shed light on Mars' distant past, which was possibly much wetter and warmer than previously believed. 'The contents of this meteorite may challenge many long held notions about Martian geology,"" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. 'These findings also present an important reference frame for the Curiosity rover as it searches for reduced organics in the minerals exposed in the bedrock of Gale Crater.'","2 Billion year old meteorite was discovered in the Sahara desert .

A devastated family have paid tribute to their 'special angel' schoolgirl after she died suddenly in her sleep. Hockey coach Caitlin McCart, 17, was found dead in her bedroom by her heartbroken mother Kathleen, 47. Miss McCart, of Bellshill, Lanarkshire, was a star player for Uddingston Ladies Hockey team and regularly led children's training at the popular club. The fit and healthy teenager had gone to bed as normal with no signs of ill health but woke in the early hours of October 23 feeling unwell. Mrs McCart let her sleep longer in the morning but the mother-of-two was left griefstricken after discovering Caitlin was not breathing when she later went to wake her. Caitlin's cause of death is still unknown but the family are awaiting results from further tests. Speaking last night Mrs McCart and her husband James, 54, paid tribute to their 'special angel'. Mrs McCart said: 'I'm still in complete shock. We all are. 'Caitlin was a normal, healthy teenager who was really into sports. 'She went to bed as normal but then was unwell.

The Duchess of Cornwall has paid tribute to her ‘workaholic’ husband on his 65th birthday, revealing: ‘He’s not one for chilling.’ In an unprecedented interview during the couple’s official tour of India, Camilla also admitted that Prince Charles was ‘the most difficult person in the world to buy a present for’ – and that he was unlikely to celebrate becoming a pensioner unless she ‘hopped up and down singing happy birthday’. Her revelations offer a charming insight into the couple’s relationship and a rarely glimpsed side of the future king, who is already the longest-serving heir in British history and today turns a pensioner. The Duchess of Cornwall has paid tribute to her 'workaholic' husband on his 65th birthday. Her revelations, in an unprecedented interview, offer a charming insight into the couple's relationship . The Duchess, 66, was speaking after an engagement at the Aluva Palace in Kerala, south-west India, on Tuesday, where she met women who have been helped to start their own businesses. But what should have been a brief exchange of words on the rain-sodden balcony turned into a lengthy chat as she spoke with undisguised warmth about her husband. She said: ‘I will tell you that he is the most difficult person in the world to buy a present for. He is a man! They are hopeless! I spend ages trying to find something that is really wonderful and then [she mimes him opening a present] “Oh, thank you very much” [she uses a non-committal voice]. It is so annoying. ‘So he likes to make a list of things that he wants so you get it exactly right. I find this time of year impossible as it’s his birthday and then it’s Christmas, so you have got two in a row. Everybody else is easy but he is not.’ Charles and Camilla arrive at Kew Place for the 80th birthday dinner for Queen Elizabeth II in 2006 . These pictures show the Prince of Wales celebrating his 50th birthday in 1998 (left) and his 60th in 2008 . The Duchess did, however, manage to find the perfect present for the Prince. ‘He collects a lot of things and it is something special – china – that I have found,’ she added. ‘It’s what he really likes. And I know he will be happy with that.’ Asked whether Charles planned to celebrate or commiserate his big day, she smiled and said: ‘I think it is commiserate – well in my case I went very quiet about it. Luckily he has caught up with me now. We are both pensioners and he can join in with me collecting the bus pass.’ Although he likes birthdays – especially ‘cake and a bit of a sing song’ – the Duchess said it was difficult to get the Prince to take time out. ‘He never, ever stops working. He’s exhausting. No matter what the day, he is always working,’ she said of her husband, who guest-edited a special edition of Country Life magazine – featuring Camilla – to commemorate his birthday.

But he always has to finish something. He is so in the zone … you are outside …  but he is always there in the zone, working, working, working.’ The couple have a string of engagements today in India and Sri Lanka, where Charles is due to open the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on behalf on the Queen for the first time. The Duchess said they could wait until they are on the plane tomorrow to celebrate. ‘But he’ll stick with his papers, I know he will, while I am trying to sing happy birthday. I might just even have to hold up a sign saying “happy birthday, darling”,’ she laughed. 'Workaholic' Prince Charles guest-edited a special edition of Country Life magazine to commemorate his 65th . The couple took a day off from  their busy schedule yesterday at a luxury resort in Kerala. The Duchess said: ‘To be honest I think I am just going to chill out, completely, I don’t think I am going to do anything really.’ But asked whether she would persuade Charles to ‘chill out’, she laughed: ‘I doubt it, although I shall do my best. If there’s a little hint of sun I might just persuade him to go for a walk or sit outside. He loves walking, so that might do it. ‘We see the sun all the time but we never get the chance to just go and sit in it. So that would be bliss. So maybe I will persuade him. But no, my husband is not one for chilling.’","Wife Camilla revealed Prince Charles was unlikely to celebrate becoming a pensioner unless she 'hopped up and down singing happy birthday'

Fellow firefighters, the men's family members and residents of Yarnell, the small town they died trying to save, openly cried as the hourslong caravan crawled past. The crew of elite Granite Mountain Hotshots was working to build a fire line between the blaze and Yarnell when erratic winds suddenly shifted the fire's direction, causing it to hook around the firefighters and cut off access to a ranch that was to be their safety zone.

He was down there at the time the evacuations were in progress, then when he met with the staff and learned of some firsthand details with folks on the scene that the firefighters passed away, he made the decision we need to bring them down the hill in honor,’ agency spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn said. The fire was 90 percent contained Sunday, after destroying more than 100 homes in Yarnell and burning about 13 square miles. The town remained evacuated Sunday.

Scientists now say it's the time you spend walking rather than the speed you go which matters . The health benefits of going for a walk have long been recognised. And now scientists say it’s the time you spend rather than the speed you go. They found that doing at least one to two hours a day was associated with reduced stroke risk in the over-60s. But strenuous ‘power walks’ were not required. Some 3,435 healthy men aged 60 to 80 were questioned about the distance they walked each week and their usual pace. The study showed that those who went for eight to 14 hours a week were a third less likely to have a stroke than those who walked less than three hours. For men walking more than 22 hours a week, the risk was two thirds lower, according to the study published in the American Heart Association journal Stroke. ‘If you took 1,000 men who usually walk eight to 14 hours per week and followed them for ten years, on average they would have 55 strokes, compared with 80 for the group who only walk zero to three hours a week,’ said researcher Dr Barbara Jefferis of University College London. ‘The total time spent walking was more consistently protective against stroke than pace; overall it seemed that accumulating more time walking was most beneficial. Our findings suggest that regular walking could be an important part of stroke prevention strategies in older people.’ Teams found that doing at least one to two hours a day was associated with reduced stroke risk in the over-60s. But strenuous 'power walks' were not required . Each year around 152,000 people have strokes in the UK, which can be fatal or disabling. Dr Shannon Amoils, from the British Heart Foundation, which part-funded the study, said: 'Whatever your age it’s important to stay active every day. ‘This research suggests a daily walk could help to reduce stroke risk and is further evidence that regular exercise – even a daily stroll in the park – can be an effective way to keep healthy.’","For men walking more than 22 hours a week, risk is two thirds lower .

The leader of the Granite Mountain Hotshot crew, the team of 19 firefighters killed after getting trapped in a fierce Arizona inferno last month, has been accused of violating wildfire safety protocols. Eric Marsh, together with 18 of his colleagues perished in the Yarnell Hill Fire on June 30. Now the deputy director of the Arizona State Forestry Division, Jerry Payne, has said he believes Marsh, 43, ‘violated several basic wildfire rules including not knowing the location of the fire, not having a spotter observing the fire and leading his crew through thick, unburned vegetation near a wildfire.’ Eric Marsh, left, superintendent of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, has been accused of violating wildfire safety protocols by Jerry Payne, right, deputy director of the Arizona State Forestry Division . “The division supervisor broke those rules and put those people at risk,” Payne told InvestigativeMedia.com. Firefighters are expected to follow the '10 Standard Fire Orders’ and ’18 Watch Out Situations’ at all times, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, which coordinates wildfire management operations across the country. Payne said he believed Marsh felt he had time to lead the Hotshots from a safe area on a ridge when the fire was a mile or two away. 'It was a calculated risk. They didn’t even make it halfway,' Payne said. 'It was a serious miscalculation, in my opinion. It was an honest mistake.' Tragedy: The 19 firefighters perished in the Yarnell Hill Fire on June 30 . Before the end: Firefighter Andrew Ashcraft send this picture of members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots to his wife, Juliann, shortly before all 19 men were killed . Nevertheless, Payne said Marsh knew that he 'should have had somebody watching the fire.' Payne said Marsh communicated with their lookout, Brendan McDonough, to make sure he had an escape route. McDonough then left his position to join the Blue Ridge Hotshots nearby as the fire approached. He was the only member of the Granite Mountain Hotshot crew to survive. Neither Payne nor the Arizona State Forestry Division is not part of the team investigation the fire.

Touch - even with something inanimate like a teddy - may genuinely help people with low self-esteem . Anyone with a beloved stuffed toy or teddy may believe they have genuine healing powers, but this is the first time science has confirmed it. While most of us deal the prospect of our impending death by attempting to live meaningful lives, those with low self esteem often struggle with this. Viewing themselves and their lives as worthless they can feel far more upset by existential thoughts than the rest of the population. Now, research suggests that touch - even with something inanimate like a teddy - may genuinely help people with low self-esteem in confronting their own mortality. In a series of studies published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, researchers from UV University Amsterdam tested the hypothesis that people with low self-esteem deal with concerns about their own death and the meaning of their life by connecting with others. ‘Even fleeting and seemingly trivial instances of interpersonal touch may help people to deal more effectively with existential concern,’ explains psychological scientist and lead researcher Sander Koole. ‘This is important because we all have to deal with existential concerns and we all have times at which we struggle to find meaning in life,’ he says. Koole and colleagues tested the hypothesis that people with low self-esteem deal with existential concerns by connecting with others. In one study, a researcher approached participants as they walked through a university campus. She handed the participants questionnaires to fill out; for some of the participants, she accompanied the questionnaire with a light, open-palmed touch on the shoulder blade that lasted about one second. Interestingly, participants with low self-esteem who received the brief touch reported less death anxiety on the questionnaire than those who had not been touched. Those who had been touched also showed better social connectedness after being reminded of death in comparison to those who had not received the light pat. Anyone with a beloved stuffed toy or teddy may feel they have always known it has genuine healing powers, but this is the first time science has confirmed it . The research also suggests that individuals with low self-esteem may desire, and even seek out, touch when they are confronted with their own death. Participants with low self-esteem who were reminded of death estimated the value of a teddy bear at about €23 (about £19), while those who had not been reminded of death estimated the value at about €13 euros (£10), a full €10 less. Being able to touch the teddy bear while estimating its value seemed to provide comfort to participants with low self-esteem, reducing their levels of common defensive reactions to reminders of death. ‘Our findings show that even touching an inanimate object — such as a teddy bear — can soothe existential fears,' notes Koole. 'Interpersonal touch is such a powerful mechanism that even objects that simulate touch by another person may help to instill in people a sense of existential significance.’ Koole and colleagues believe that touch could be a useful supplement to more traditional therapies in treating low self-esteem and related disorders, such as depression and anxiety. The researchers are currently exploring the possibilities of simulated interpersonal touch through the use of a ‘haptic jacket,’ which can electronically give people the feeling that they are being hugged.","People with low self-esteem often struggle with their own mortality .

Tumbleweed was first noticed in America in October 1880 when the Department of Agriculture in Washington received information that a strange plant that had begun appearing in the farmlands of South Dakota. Some stories claim that it was brought to America by Ukrainian farmers, but it's exactly origins are tricky to pinpoint. In the 1890s a legislator proposed that a fence be built around the state to stem the incursion, but a decade after it had first been noticed, it was too late and the weed had already found its way to Canada. It quickly spread across the West and by 1885 it had reached California and in 1959 it was collected for the first time in Hawaii. Today the USDA Plants Database lists Russian thistle growing in every state except Florida and Alaska. The tumbleweed appeared in Western films which typically have barren and sparse landscapes - it has now come to represent dry and abandoned landscapes as it used to represent a bad joke or awkward silence. Tumbleweeds aren't considered as having any redeeming value, althoough a study did reveal that tumbling tumbleweeds soak up depleted uranium from contaminated soils at weapons testing grounds.","Plants are mostly associated with isolated desert areas of the United States due to regular appearances in Westerns .

A 13-year veteran with the Oklahoma City Fire Department is accused of raping a 13-year-old girl over a period of months and giving her a secret cell phone so she could send him nude pictures of herself. Corporal Jason Lyle Wood, 39, was arrested Friday at the 911 dispatch center, where he has worked for a decade after three years fighting fires. He has been charged with rape, forcible sodomy and lewd molestation of a minor. The alleged victim's father contacted a sheriff's deputy to make allegations against Wood, claiming the pair had engaged in sexual acts multiple times since June. Court records state the encounters took place in New Mexico and several Oklahoma cities including Moore and Elmore City. Accused: Corporal Jason Lyle Wood, 39, pictured, was arrested Friday and has been charged with rape, forcible sodomy and lewd acts with a 13-year-old girl . 'It's just disturbing to find out of an alleged crime like this occurring in my county, especially when it crosses over multiple jurisdictions,' Garvin County Sheriff Larry Rhodes told News 9. Wood allegedly gave the girl the cell phone so he could contact her without her parents knowing and he instructed her text him every morning. He also reportedly requested and received nude photographs of the teen and sent nude photographs of himself to her on the phone. The 13-year-old underwent a forensic exam in Norman on Wednesday with a Moore police officer and Garvin County sheriff's deputies present. Wood is being held in Garvin County jail on $75,000 bond. Investigators believe they have a strong case against him. 'We do feel that the evidence we recovered will lead to possibly additional charges or corroborate the initial charges in this case,' said Rhodes. Veteran: Wood was arrested at the 911 dispatch center within Oklahoma City Fire Department, pictured, where he has worked for a decade after three years fighting fires . He added that his deputies were looking to see if there are additional victims and are appealing to the public for information. Oklahoma City Fire Chief Keith Bryant said the department would be taking the allegations very seriously. 'We're going to cooperate with law enforcement and see where this goes,' Bryant said, adding that Wood has been taken off duty but will remain an employee pending an internal investigation. 'City policy dictates that we give the employee due process, but we will be meeting with (Wood) as soon as possible, Bryant told News 9. It was also reported that Wood accessed Oklahoma City Police Department files late last month after learning he was being investigated.","Jason Lyle Wood was arrested Friday at the 911 dispatch center within Oklahoma City Fire Department, where he's worked for 13 years .

A mystery condition that causes extreme pain among sufferers has baffled doctors and researchers, who can find neither its cause nor its cure. Sufferers of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) wake up one morning to debilitating pain that does not go away. The condition usually affects the arms, legs, hands or feet and sometimes occurs after an injury as minor as a bruise, but often appears without any identified trauma. Chronic pain: People with CRPS experience constant or intermittent changes in temperature, skin color, and swelling of the affected limb . Vicious cycle: CRPS is caused by nerves sending the brain constant pain signals . Alexandra Annaloro, 21, was struck by the condition in her right leg. It has left her so debilitated that she can't walk for longer than 10 minutes. Sometimes, the pain is so bad that her leg shakes uncontrollably. 'There’s days that I cry a lot. It’s hard,' she told CBS. With no clear cause, it's difficult to diagnose, but doctors do know that CRPS is a condition of the nervous system. It causes nerves to begin sending constant pain signals to the brain. Daily battle: Alexandra Annaloro (left) and Daphne Cuebas (right) both suffer from CRPS . The illness is difficult to manage and often does not respond to any kind of treatment plan. It generally worsens over time and can spread to other areas of the body. Excruciating: According to the McGill Pain Index Chart, CRPS causes pain worse that childbirth . On the McGill Pain Index, a chart that doctors use to measure their patients' pain levels, the condition ranks extremely highly, receiving a score of 42 out of 50, higher than both childbirth and amputation. The mystery illness can strike anyone, anywhere at any time. Children as young as two have been diagnosed with the condition, and women are four times more likely to suffer from it than men. Dealing with so much pain makes life difficult for suffers, and for some, it all becomes too much. 'I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I can’t function,' suffer Daphne Cuebas told CBS. 'I actually thought of ending my life. It came to that extreme.' There are many different treatments . currently being used with varying levels of success, including . intramuscular botox injections, spinal cord stimulators and various . forms of psychotherapy and hypnosis. For Cuebas, a device surgically implanted into her side delivers morphine directly to her knee and has given her relief for the first time since she developed the condition 14 years ago. Researchers at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke are studying new approaches to treating the illness, but the consensus is that early treatment - within three months of developing symptoms - is the most effective.","Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) can happen to anyone without any specific cause .

The victim claimed she was kicked, thrown down stairs and had her face smashed on concrete, breaking bones near both her eyes. Hollywood Police told NBC 6 they were able to identify all five of the teenagers allegedly involved because one of the accused took video of the fight and sexual assault on their cell phone. Woolfork and Singleton were jailed without bond when they appeared in court yesterday, dressed in jailhouse scrubs with their wrists handcuffed behind their backs, for the first hearing in their case. According to the Sun Sentinel, Broward County Judge John Hurley said: 'This 16-year-old woman, both of her eyes were closed from being beaten, she had blood coming from one of her ears.

'Get out': The owner of Carnegie Deli on 854 Seventh Avenue in New York City wants her husband's lover to move out of the building . According to the New York Post, Penkae Siricharoen's relatives opened a restaurant in Thailand which was originally called Carnegie Deli Thailand but later changed its name to New York Cheese Cake after taking a tour of Carnegie Deli's New Jersey plant where all the deli's cured meats and cheesecakes are produced. Levine says she was unaware that her 'trade secrets' had been shared with the Thais, who have received rave reviews online for their authentic New York cheesecake and huge pastrami sandwiches. The New York Post reports that Marian Levine is seeking a divorce from her husband after discovering the depths of his betrayal. Marian and Sandford Levine married in 1991. She says his affair with Siricharoen has been going on for a decade, and was an open secret among the staff at Carnegie Deli. 'Everybody knew but me,' Levine told the Post. Siricharoen, 61, is a Thai immigrant who worked for the deli for many years. Deli dupe: Levine says this Thai restaurant is using her family's Carnegie Deli secret recipes . She was originally hired by Levine's father, who left the restaurant to his daughter Marian Levine when he died and was friendly with the Levines, even joining them on vacation. According to the Post, Levine remained ignorant of her husband's affair and financial dealings until he began urging her to sell the deli last year. She hired a private investigator who uncovered the affair and other secrets. Siricharoen left Carnegie Deli in 2008 to run her Queens restaurant in 2008, but remained on the payroll long after. 'Somebody punched her in,' Levine told the New York Post. 'She was making $750 a week as a manager even though she wasn’t there.' The lawsuit . Levine has filed in Manhattan Supreme Court claims her . husband of more than two decades, Sandford Levine, 71, gave Siricharoen a rent-stabilised apartment in her building on . Seventh Avenue for $975 a month for 15 years. Famous: The deli, which has been around for 76 years, is known for its pastrami and corned beef sandwiches . Celebrity hangout: Celebrities and high-profile people have been known to visit the deli, including the likes of Taylor Swift, left, and President Obama, right . Partners: The Levines ran Carnegie Deli together for many years. Now the wife is suing her husband . The . apartment would go for $3,000 a month on the open market and the suit . calls the deal Sandford’s ‘way of providing a gift to Siricharoen with . whom he was having a romantic relationship’. Levine . accuses the pair of having ‘conspired’ to cheat her out of money she . was rightfully owed under the lease, and asks a judge to throw the . 15-year deal out. The . 76-year-old deli, famed for its corned beef and pastrami sandwiches, has . been visited by many celebrities, including the likes of President . Obama, Woody Allen, Taylor Swift and Henny Youngman, according to the New York Daily News. Levine inherited the deli from her father Milton Parker and ran it with her husband for several years. Sandford even became the face of the restaurant, carrying a business card that read, ‘MBD – Married Boss’s Daughter’. Family business: Levine inherited the deli at 854 Seventh Avenue from her father, Milton Parker. Her husband's lover lives in one of the building's apartments for $975 a month . Movie director Woody Allen, left, and comedian/violinist Henny Youngman, right, were also seen eat a pastrami sandwich at Carnegie Deli in Manhattan, New York . Marian also inherited the apartment building that houses it, 854 Seventh Avenue, after her father’ s death in 2009. The suit seeks to get Siricharoen, who is from Thailand, out of the building altogether, on the grounds that she used a ‘false identity’ to rent the apartment. It says she is in the U.S. illegally, and rented the apartment using documents that belonged to her deceased sister. The status of the Levines’ relationship is unknown. The suit says the couple, who tied the knot in 1991, is still married, but also refers to Sandy Levine as a ‘former employee’. TV stars: Marian and Sandford, pictured, hosted a reality show from 2011 to 2012, called Family Pickle, which showcased their life running the restaurant . It accuses him of having ‘engaged in dishonest, intentional, willful, wanton and reckless misconduct while he was employed by plaintiff’. The suit says he and Siricharoen carried on an ‘extramarital affair and romantic relationship’ from ‘approximately 1998 to the present’. The Levines starred in their own short-lived reality show between 2011 and 2012 called Family Pickle, which showcased their efforts to run the restaurant. In a bio on the show's website, the pair are described as 'a perfect match: equal in drive, bluster, and passion. Though their head-to-head battles are a matter of daily routine, their bond is like nuclear fusion: as unbreakable as it is fiery hot.' According to the Post, Sandford Levine and Penkae Siricharoen are living together in a $1 million house in Boca, Florida.","Marian Levine, 63, owner of Carnegie Deli, says her husband gave his lover secret family recipes .

George Moore died aged just 10 months old after going on his first foreign holiday to Tunisia with his mother Emma, 24 . A baby who fell ill on a flight to his first foreign holiday died hours later from  suspected meningitis. Ten-month-old George Moore became poorly after arriving in Tunisia with his mother and grandparents. After appearing hot, lethargic and sleepy on landing, he was seen by the hotel doctor who recommended he go to hospital. But once there his condition  deteriorated and despite the best efforts of medical staff he went into cardiac arrest and died. Last night his mother Emma Moore, 24, urged parents to be  vigilant and told how the disease struck with shocking speed. She said: ‘We couldn’t believe that such a healthy, advanced, happy, little boy could be gone with hardly any warning. You truly wouldn’t believe it unless you had been unfortunate enough to have experienced a similar situation. ‘George was such a happy little boy who was always laughing and giggling. No one expects to go on holiday and come back without their baby.’ The tragedy occurred last month as Mrs Moore, a bank clerk, waited at Manchester Airport with her parents, Chris and Lesley Wignall, to board their plane. Suddenly George was sick but the family presumed it was down to the change of routine and the fact he had just drunk a whole bottle of milk. He fell asleep on the plane but when he woke he appeared grumpy and soon fell back to sleep again. Mrs Moore of Penwortham, near Preston, said: ‘Once we arrived in Tunisia I fed George another full bottle and he again seemed tired, grumpy and lethargic which we thought was due to the fact that he’d been woken in the night and was still catching up on sleep. Emma had been shopping before the holiday on October 6 and had bought George sunglasses and a hat (left) ‘At the hotel I fed George his baby . food jar which he ate half of before falling asleep again and I began to . think there was something not quite right. ‘I dug out my thermometer and realised . he had a temperature and I ran a cool bath. He was very floppy and . needed holding up in the bath.’ The hotel doctor was called and he recommended they go to hospital. Within half an hour they were in a children’s ward. Emma said her son had been sick and grumpy before boarding the flight at 6am, but she put this down to the change in his usual routine and the fact that he had drunk a bottle of milk . Baby George slept through most of the flight and it was only when Emma arrived at the hotel she began to think that something was wrong when she struggled to wake him up . The hotel doctor recommended George be taken to hospital but said it was 'nothing serious'. However, when George arrived his skin became blotchy and he struggled to breathe before dying shortly after . There are two types of meningitis, bacterial and viral. Bacterial is the most dangerous because it can cause septicemia - or blood poisoning, which can be fatal. Most people know to look out for a rash which doesn't fade when pressed against a glass - but this is a later symptom and doesn't always appear. In babies and very young children, early warning signs include being floppy or unresponsive, vomiting or refusing food, and being very sleepy and reluctant to wake up. The child may also develop a staring expression, pale or blotchy skin, and be irritable and not want to be held. Other symptoms can include having unusually cold hands and feet, blue lips, shivering, and pain in muscles or joints. If you detect any of the above symptoms with a fever, you are advised to call 999 immediately and request an ambulance. Later symptoms are drowsiness, confusion, seizures, sensitivity to bright lights, rapid breathing, and a rash. Viral meningitis can still be serious, but usually has mild flu-like symptoms. George’s hands, feet and ears were . turning slightly blue and were very cold even though he had a high . temperature. He had also developed tiny, blackhead-like spots around his . mouth. He was placed on a drip and a heart monitor but appeared frustrated and began wriggling and getting tangled in the wires. Mrs Moore – whose self-employed . husband, Richard, had stayed at home to work – said: ‘George’s whole . face had turned a purple  colour and he had developed big red blotches . all over his head. ‘The nurses immediately began giving . him oxygen via a mask and told us they needed to take him straight to . intensive care. When my dad and I went to see George, his whole body was . red with big white blotches. ‘I stayed alone with George for a . while singing, talking and kissing him before the doctor came to examine . him and told me to leave the room. 'I could hear the machines beeping . and nurses rushing in and out and they informed me it wasn’t good, that . he was unstable and they were massaging his heart. 'Within 15 minutes the . doctor returned to tell us his heart had stopped and he had . unfortunately passed away. I couldn’t believe it.’ A post-mortem examination was carried . out in Tunisia and the results are still unavailable, although British . doctors believe George died of meningococcal septicaemia. The family flew back to the UK three days later and want to raise awareness about the disease by raising funds for charity. The family have set up a fund for Meningitis Now in remembrance of George and want to raise as much money as possible to fight the disease. George was also on holiday with his grandfather Chris Wignall (right). His father, Richard, was unable to come because he is self-employed and struggles to get time off work . The tragedy happened after Emma agreed to join her parents Chris (left) and Lesley Wignall (right) for a Crown Green Bowls tournament .

Delay: Paramedics were made to wait 26 minutes to treat stroke victim Leslie Coombs, 89, as managers would not let them enter his sheltered accommodation room . Paramedics were prevented from tending to a stroke victim after care home managers refused to let them enter his room because it breached company policy. Leslie Coombs who was a mechanic in WWII collapsed while he was on the phone to insurers The AA after he called them about repairs to his car. The AA operator quickly dialled 999 and . paramedics rushed to the 89-year-old's room at the Jubilee Court sheltered housing complex . in Strelley, near Nottingham. However, when the ambulance crew arrived, staff would not let them enter the room, and they were made to wait for 26 minutes until a warden arrived with a spare key. A telephone operator also refused to give paramedics . the code for a wall-mounted safe which contained a master key because . it was 'against company policy'. Frightened Mr Coombs was screaming for help through the letter box, while paramedics were forced to wait on the other side of the door. When a warden finally arrived with a . master key, paramedics entered the room and rushed Mr Coombs, who served . as an RAF mechanic in Singapore during World War Two, to hospital where . he died of a heart attack nine days later. His family have accused the . managers of the sheltered housing complex, run by Places for People, . of endangering the lives of residents. His daughter Glenis Riley, 66, is considering taking legal action against Nottingham City Homes, which runs the out-of-hours service for Places for People. 'My father was fit and healthy for his age but I strongly believe the stress of being left on the floor in his room while paramedics were outside caused his death,' said Mrs Riley, a retired community care worker. 'He was on the phone to the AA about his car when he suffered a stroke. 'The operator called 999 and my father tried to get to the front door so he could open it for the paramedics. 'He always locked himself in because there had been a few burglaries in the area but he was always confident if he did collapse someone would help because they kept a master key on the premises at all times. Restricted: Out of hours staff at Jubilee Court refused to give paramedics the code to access a master key. Eventually Mr Coombs was taken to hospital, but later died of a heart attack . 'When the paramedics did arrive they were talking to my dad through the letter box. 'He was shouting ‘For God’s sake help me’ but they had to explain they had to wait. 'One of the paramedics called the operator of the complex to ask for the code to the key safe by the entrance but they wouldn’t give it to him. 'Apparently the operator said they could not be sure it really was the paramedic and it was therefore against company policy to hand the code out to them. Anger: Mr Coombs's daughter, Glenis Riley said she was 'disgusted' at the treatment her father received . 'Part of me thinks the paramedics should have kicked the door down but they were in a very difficult position. 'You expect when your dad is in a housing complex they will make sure there is a fast way of getting into his room if he is in trouble but my dad was left stranded on the floor because of these jobsworths.' Mr Coombs, who had seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren moved into the complex in 1999 after his wife Florence died of cancer aged 66. After his stroke on October 12 this year, he was taken to the Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham and later transferred to Nottingham City Hospital where he suffered a fatal heart attack on October 21. Mrs Riley, from Bingham, Nottingham, said: 'I am disgusted at what my father had to go through during his final days. 'He had been living in that complex since 1990 and was an able man, he did his own shopping and he drove his own car. 'To think he was lying there helpless in his bedroom while the ambulance crew were on the other side of the door is shocking, no one should have to go through that. 'I have had various people sending through their condolences but I want answers into why more couldn’t have been done. 'I am thankful for the AA contacting the right people and trying to help my father, but after that, not enough was done for him. 'He is and will be missed, he was a father-of-two, grandfather-of-seven, great-grandfather-of-two with one on the way that he never got the chance to hear about. 'More needs to be done so that this doesn’t happen to other families because we are very angry about what happened, we’re furious. 'When he first moved into the complex, there was a warden on site, although through the years the warden disappeared, maybe they should bring a warden back so these incidents can be dealt with quicker.' Both Nottingham City Homes and Places for People launched have investigations into the treatment of Mr Coombs. Hero: Mr Coombs, pictured left as an air cadet, served as an RAF mechanic in Singapore, right, during WWII . A Nottingham City Homes spokesman said: 'We are already speaking with Places for People to see if they require us to make any changes to the contracted emergency response procedure we have with them.' She added that the mobile operator reached the property within 26 minutes which is inside the 30 minute target for responding to emergencies. Kim Scott, director at Places for People Individual Support, added: 'The safety of our customers is of the utmost importance and we are reviewing the current process together with Nottingham City Homes and the emergency services. 'If changes are required these will be made as a priority.' Simon Cook, of the Stroke Association, said time was of the essence when dealing with stroke victims. He said: 'When a stroke strikes the brain is starved of oxygen and as a result brain cells in the affected area die. 'The sooner patients receive treatment, the more likely they are to make a better recovery.' An East Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'Paramedics had problems reaching Mr Coombs. 'Paramedics would only break a door down to get to patients as a last resort.'","Leslie Coombs, 89, collapsed in his sheltered accommodation room .

A mother who went out curtain shopping instead of taking her injured baby to hospital has been warned by a judge that she may be given community service to help improver her parenting skills. Nicky Thompson and her boyfriend Beau Degeorge had noticed swelling on her six-month-old daughter's head but waited two days before taking her to get treatment. When doctors eventually saw the child they found severe ‘boggy’ swelling on the right side . of the baby’s head caused by a skull fracture and on the left side a . complex fracture had caused further swelling. Nicky Thompson had noticed swelling on her six-month-old daughter's head, but it was two days before her boyfriend took the child to Homerton Hospital in east London, where doctors found the baby had fractured her skull . A court was told that 30-year-old Degeorge could not be bothered to take . the baby to the hospital when the injuries were first discovered on . September 30, 2011 because he would have had to tale two buses to get there. He told police he lied to 21-year-old . Thompson about taking the girl to a walk-in centre to ‘avoid an . argument’, Snaresbrook Crown Court had heard. Thompson, of Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, then went curtain shopping with her mother the following day while the baby’s condition deteriorated. The pair were both found guilty of a single charge of cruelty to a person under the age of 16 by a jury of five men and six women, and were ordered to return to court for sentencing in January. It was not until October 2, when the baby’s eyes were vacant and she had not been her usual playful seld, that Degeorge finally took her to Homerton Hospital in east London to be treated. ‘They neglected their child’, said prosecutor Emma Smith. ‘It would appear that despite seeing the swelling, they thought the baby did not need medical attention. ‘Thompson says that on seeing the swelling she thought the baby did need medical attention but rather than taking her herself, she told Degeorge to go - but he didn’t. ‘The child wasn’t getting any better, but rather than taking her to the doctor, Thompson chose to go shopping for curtains with her mother.’ When the baby was finally taken to hospital and seen at 5.50pm on Sunday, October 2, Degeorge and Thompson spun a web of lies, blaming the delay on each another. 'Degeorge told the doctor that they noticed the swelling above the right ear on the Friday’, said Ms Smith. ‘The doctor noted the swelling and the baby cried when she touched her on the head - another doctor found a 10cm boggy swelling on the child’s head. ‘Degeorge told the doctor she had not been her normal self and was not smiling or playful - he said he did not know any reason why the swelling might have occurred. ‘When asked about the mother, he said that she felt he was making a big deal out of nothing.’ The court was told that Degeorge, of Hackney, East London, received a string of calls from Thompson while at the hospital, but he told the doctor she had locked herself out of the house and needed the keys. Thompson eventually arrived at the hospital and told doctors she had taken the baby to Royal London Hospital on Friday, claiming she was told the tot had probably hit her head on something. ‘On Monday, October 3, the baby was seen by a paediatrician and when asked, Thompson said she had noticed the swelling on the Thursday and that the father had taken the child to a walk-in centre the next day,’ Ms Smith continued. ‘There had been no visit to a walk-in centre - the father had lied and told the mother he had in order to avoid an argument. Judge Judith Hughes QC, sitting at Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured, said she needed to consider if there was a form of community service that Thompson could carry out to help with her parenting skills . ‘It really comes down to this - why didn’t both parents take her to the hospital on that Friday when they say they first noticed the swelling? ‘Fortunately there was no obvious brain damage sustained by this child.’ The pair were arrested a week later and interviewed by police but both gave differing accounts on what had happened that weekend. Degeorge told police Thompson had told him to call NHS Direct, but after she refused to make the call, he decided not to call out of principle. He said he didn’t take the baby to hospital on that Friday because he would have to get two buses, and told Thompson he had when in fact he had gone to his mother’s house. Thompson told police Degeorge had said the baby would be OK and that he would then take her to the hospital. She said she had wanted to take her to hospital but Degeorge had left too quickly and told her he was taking the baby to the hospital when he in fact hadn’t. She had no explanation as to why she went shopping. The girl suffered no lasting damage from the incident. Judge Judith Hughes QC said: ‘I think in Ms Thompson’s case a report is essential - I need to consider whether there is some form of community punishment that might assist her with such things as parenting skills. ‘For parity, I will have a report on Mr Degeorge as well but I make it clear that currently, all options are open at this stage for both defendants.’ Degeorge was remanded in custody while Thompson was released on bail ahead of sentence on January 6 next year.","Nicky Thompson and Beau Degeorge waited days to get treatment for baby .

Geoffrey Counsell, 51, was in charge of the fireworks display in Taunton, smog from which caused a fatal crash on the M5, Bristol Crown Court heard . A fireworks display created an ‘impenetrable’ wall of smog that drifted over a motorway and caused a 34-car pile-up which left seven dead, a court heard yesterday. The smoke was so thick that motorists said it was ‘as if someone had tipped a tin of paint over the windscreen’, a jury heard. Prosecutors say that motorists on the northbound carriageway of the M5 near Taunton in Somerset had 'no chance' as they drove along at around 8.20pm on the evening of November 4, 2011. Anthony and Pamela Adams, Maggie and Michael Barton, Malcolm Beacham, Terry Brice and Kye Thomas died and 51 people were injured, including some seriously, in the pile-up. A total of 34 vehicles, including cars and lorries, were involved in the crash on the motorway when they were driven into a thick smog, which had blown across the northbound carriageway from the firework display at the nearby Taunton Rugby Club. Prosecutors allege that Geoffrey Counsell, who was the contractor in charge of the display, breached health and safety rules by failing to ensure the safety of others. The organiser did not include drawings of the site in his risk assessment plan, a court heard. The event saw around 1,500 rockets fired during a 15 minute display. And Counsell allegedly did not include sketches of the site when he filled in risk assessment forms. He then handed the plans to Colin Bentley, marketing manager at Taunton Rugby Club where the event was held, three weeks before the show. But Mr Bentley did not read them because he is dyslexic and there were no drawings to assess any potential dangers, a court was told. Counsell, who runs Firestorm Pyrotechnics, did not keep a copy of the risk assessment forms himself, Bristol Crown Court heard. 'Biggest in living memory': Seven people died and 51 were injured in the smash on 4 November, 2011 . Counsell is facing a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act of failing to ensure the safety of others. Peter Blair, prosecuting, said Counsell met with Mr Bentley on October 14 to hand over the forms. Mr Blair said: 'They were pre-prepared. Mr Counsell had already brought them in a prepared state. 'Mr Bentley has dyslexia and he accepts he did not read them. He has searched for them and can not find them now but it is his recollection that when he was handed that risk assessment it did not have on it a sketch plan.' He added that Mr Counsell did not retain a copy of the risk assessment for himself. He said: 'Would Mr Counsell not retain a copy for himself, not least to remind himself of the significant features of the site and the geography of it to have it at the front of his mind when three weeks later he came to do the display?' Counsell had been carrying out a fireworks display at Taunton Rugby Club which runs adjacent to the M5 on November 4, 2011. He set off around 1,500 fireworks during a 15 minute display which was electronically triggered, the court heard. Counsell is facing a Health and Safety prosecution after the deadly smash on the motorway in Somerset . Mr Blair said the Les Phippen Memorial Stand - opposite the main clubhouse and where the display took place - was 190 metres from the edge of the M5 motorway. A combination of a lack of wind and humid conditions then helped create a low smog in the area, the court was told. Mr Blair said: 'He was not handling little rockets and bangers that we might acquire in November for our back gardens for our children. He was handling explosives. 'Essentially what we will hear is particles making up the smoke are able to attract moisture in the air and as they attract moisture the particles grow. 'Any light that is shone towards that spot then scatters. It can not penetrate. It creates an impenetrable smog.' The deadly smash happened between 34 vehicles on the northbound stretch of the M5, just after Junction 25 at around 8.25pm. Counsell is facing a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act of failing to ensure the safety of others . Aerial shots after the crash showed the trail of devastation with burned out cars and lorries covering the carriageway. Drivers caught in the smoke from the fireworks display run by Counsell, 51, said it was like 'having a pot of paint tipped over the windscreen', the court heard. Motorists became 'completely disorientated' and the lights from their cars were not strong enough to penetrate the smog. Peter Blair, prosecuting, said the pile up happened at around 8.21pm - just six minutes after Counsell's display finished. He said: 'Essentially the display went on and the smoke drifted east. It engulfed the pitch itself. It was gloomy. It was really thick. 'It hit the motorway embankment and began rising. There was little wind. It seemed to be travelling at a walking pace towards the motorway. View of the wreckage on the M5 in Somerset . 'The prosecution say they experienced a loss of visibility generated we say by a plume of smoke created by Mr Counsell from his firework display which had built up and built up. 'It could not disperse because there was no wind to do that, mixed with that humid air that was around and it drifted towards the motorway becoming a thick smog. 'With visibility at effectively zero there would have been no opportunity for drivers to have reacted.' He said the first few cars - who were not involved in the mass pile up - described 'the suddenness of entering it and the suddenness of leaving it'. Mr Blair said: 'The prosecution say this was no ordinary patch of fog. Some speak of it as if someone had tipped a pot of paint over the windscreen. 'They were completely disorientated. Their car lights had no affect whatsoever pointing to what was in front of them. 'They couldn't see any road signs. It was impossible to see anything around them.' He said as a result 34 cars ploughed into each other and a number burst into flames. He added: 'Some of them were of such intensity that even firefighters had to retreat and withdraw from the rescue effort at some stage.' The jury were shown a video from a camera which was attached to the front of a train which travelled on the railway line close to the rugby club. The train driver, travelling from Bristol to Taunton, spotted the mass smash-up and momentarily could not see anything in front of his train, at around 8.30pm. Mr Blair said: 'It is more opaque near the club there. It becomes clearer as it moves away towards Taunton. 'You gain an impression as to how visibility was affected at 11 minutes past eight that evening as the train passed that display. 'He [the driver] it was bright silver with grey marble moving very slowly through it. It wasn't until the other side of the motorway bridge he could see a thing.' The packed public gallery heard the drivers could do nothing to stop themselves colliding with the cars which crashed in front of them. In October 2012 Mr Counsell, of Ashill, Somerset, was charged with seven counts of manslaughter but those were dropped.

The unusually powerful late-season wave of thunderstorms brought damaging winds and tornadoes to 12 states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and western New York. Bill Bunting, forecast operations chief of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said the storms all belonged to the same system and would be 'moving rapidly to the east and continue east overnight and into the morning'. Illinois was the hardest struck with at least six people killed and dozens more injured. An elderly man and his sister were killed when a tornado hit their home in the rural southern Illinois community of New Minden, coroner Mark Styninger said.

Washington, a town of 16,000 about 140 miles southwest of Chicago, appeared to have suffered the most severe damage. The tornado cut a path about an eighth of a mile wide from one side of town to the other, State Trooper Dustin Pierce said. Across farm fields a little more than a mile from where Zehr's home was swept up, several blocks of homes were destroyed. About 75 friends and neighbors helped . Zehr to salvage his family's belongings. He said he'd been at church . when the tornado hit but that his wife, Sue, and son were at home.

The only lights visible across most of Washington on Sunday night were red and blue flashes from police and fire truck lights. Pierce said there were reports of looting around town. Across Washington, an auto parts store with several people inside was reduced to a pile of bricks, metal and rebar; a battered car, its windshield impaled by a piece of lumber, was flung alongside it. 'The employees were climbing out of this,' Pierce said, gesturing to the rubble behind him. None of them was seriously injured, he said.

Although about 80 reports of tornadoes had come in as of Sunday night, the National Weather Service's Bunting said the actual number will likely be in the 30 to 40 range. He said that's because the same tornado often gets reported multiple times. Weather service meteorologist Matt Friedlein said such weather is rare this late in the year, but that strong winds coupled with temperatures in the 60s and 70s spawned Sunday's storms.","Kris Lancaster spoke of his sorrow at seeing his house in Washington, Illinois destroyed on Sunday as he sought shelter in the basement .
